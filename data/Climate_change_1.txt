AB This study predicted the spatiotemporal changes in the CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the pristine peatlands throughout Finland during the 21st century based on 10 km x 10 km grids. The predictions are based on a regional carbon (C) model that emphasizes the mire-type differences in ecohydrology and biogeochemistry. The model was validated by field measurements performed at multiple sites in Finland. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the CO2 flux was more sensitive to changes in temperature than to changes in precipitation, and this temperature sensitivity is greater in fens than in bogs. Conversely, the CH4 emission from pristine fens is more sensitive to the changes in precipitation and temperature than pristine bogs. The spatiotemporal changes in the CO2 and CH4 fluxes were calculated based on the country-scale patterns of mire properties (i.e., fen-bog types, vegetation, topography and peat texture) and the ACCLIM climate change scenarios. The results indicate a decreasing CO2 sinks in the country-scale peatlands, and such a decrease will be most noticeable from 2060 to 2099. In addition, the annual CO2 sink value and the annual CH4 source value of the peatlands will decrease significantly in the western areas of the raised bog region, and such changes will be greater in the pristine fens than in pristine bogs. A large fraction of the fens in the raised-bog region and the southwestern part of the aapa-mire region has the potential to shift from CO2 sinks into weak CO2 sources (<20 g C m(-2) a(-1)) by the end of the 21st century. The transition of bogs from centurial CO2 sinks to sources is most notable near coastal areas. These bogs would function as CO2 sources at an average rate of over 40 g Cm-2 a(-1) for the 21st century under the changing climate scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The response of peatlands to climate change can be highly variable. Through understanding past changes we can better predict the response of peatlands to future climate change. We use a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct the surface wetness and carbon accumulation of the Mukhrino mire (Western Siberia), describing the development of the mire since peat formation in the early Holocene, around 9360 cal. year BP. The mire started as a rich fen which initiated after paludification of a spruce forest (probably in response to a wetter climate), while the Mukhrino mire progressed to ombrotrophic bog conditions (8760 cal. year BP). This transition coincided with the intensive development of mires in Western Siberia and was associated with active carbon accumulation (31 g m(-2) year(-1)). The ecosystem underwent a change to a tree-covered state around 5860 cal. year BP, likely in response to warming and possible droughts and this accompanied low carbon accumulation (12 g m(2) year(-1)). If the future climate will be warmer and wetter, then regional mires are likely to remain a carbon sink, alternatively, a reversion to the wooded state with reduced carbon sink strength is possible.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions from northern peatlands are projected to increase due to climate change, primarily because of projected increases in soil temperature. Yet, the rates and temperature responses of the two CH4 emission-related microbial processes (CH4 production by methanogens and oxidation by methanotrophs) are poorly known. Further, peatland sites within a fen-bog gradient are known to differ in the variables that regulate these two mechanisms, yet the interaction between peatland type and temperature lacks quantitative understanding. Here, we investigated potential CH4 production and oxidation rates for 14 peatlands in Finland located between c. 60 and 70 degrees N latitude, representing bogs, poor fens, and rich fens. Potentials were measured at three different temperatures (5, 17.5, and 30celcius) using the laboratory incubation method. We linked CH4 production and oxidation patterns to their methanogen and methanotroph abundance, peat properties, and plant functional types. We found that the rich fen-bog gradient-related nutrient availability and methanogen abundance increased the temperature response of CH4 production, with rich fens exhibiting the greatest production potentials. Oxidation potential showed a steeper temperature response than production, which was explained by aerenchymous plant cover, peat water holding capacity, peat nitrogen, and sulfate content. The steeper temperature response of oxidation suggests that, at higher temperatures, CH4 oxidation might balance increased CH4 production. Predicting net CH4 fluxes as an outcome of the two mechanisms is complicated due to their different controls and temperature responses. The lack of correlation between field CH4 fluxes and production/oxidation potentials, and the positive correlation with aerenchymous plants points toward the essential role of CH4 transport for emissions. The scenario of drying peatlands under climate change, which is likely to promote Sphagnum establishment over brown mosses in many places, will potentially reduce the predicted warming-related increase in CH4 emissions by shifting rich fens to Sphagnum-dominated systems.

AB The carbon (C) storage of northern peatlands is equivalent to similar to 34-46% of the similar to 795Tg C currently held in the atmosphere as CO2. Most studies report that northern peatlands are a sink of between 20 and 60g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1). Since peatland hydrology and biogeochemistry are very closely related to climate, there is concern whether northern peatlands will continue to function as C sinks with climate change. We used a coupled land surface scheme and peatland C model, called CLASS3W-MWM, to examine the sensitivity of peatland C to climate change. Based on the data available to constrain our model, we simulated the C dynamics of the Mer Bleue (MB) bog in eastern Canada and the Degero Stormyr (DS) poor fen in northern Sweden for four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change scenarios, i.e., A1B, A2, B1, and Commit, over four time periods, i.e., present day, 2030, 2060, and 2100. When the simulated future C fluxes were compared to the baseline fluxes under the present climate conditions, we found that fens were much more sensitive to climate change than bogs. Gross primary production (GPP) at MB significantly increased by 4-44% up to 2100 for all scenarios except Commit. GPP at DS significantly decreased by 34-39% for A1B and A2, and slightly increased by 6-10% for B1 and Commit. Total ecosystem respiration (TER) significantly increased by 7-57% for MB and 4-34% for DS up to 2100 for all scenarios except Commit. Net ecosystem production (NEP), therefore, significantly decreased. The bog, however, was still a C sink up to 2100, though much reduced, but the fen switched to a C source for A1B and A2 scenarios. Additional experiments where we climatically transplanted the study peatlands or forced vegetation changes when the fen became too dry showed similar but less dramatic results as the standard runs. Our results indicate that northern peatlands should be included in the C-coupled climate model to fully understand the response of C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems to climate change and to reduce the uncertainties for projecting the future climate.

AB Climate change will directly affect carbon and nitrogen mineralization through changes in temperature and soil moisture, but it may also indirectly affect mineralization rates through changes in soil quality. We used an experimental mesocosm system to examine the effects of 6-year manipulations of infrared loading (warming) and water-table level on the potential anaerobic nitrogen and carbon (as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production) mineralization potentials of bog and fen peat over 11 weeks under uniform anaerobic conditions. To investigate the response of the dominant methanogenic pathways, we also analyzed the stable isotope composition of CH4 produced in the samples. Bog peat from the highest water-table treatment produced more CO2 than bog peat from drier mesocosms. Fen peat from the highest water-table treatment produced the most CH4. Cumulative nitrogen mineralization was lowest in bog peat from the warmest treatment and lowest in the fen peat from the highest water-table treatment. As all samples were incubated under constant conditions, observed differences in mineralization patterns reflect changes in soil quality in response to climate treatments. The largest treatment effects on carbon mineralization as CO2 occurred early in the incubations and were ameliorated over time, suggesting that the climate treatments changed the size and/or quality of a small labile carbon pool. CH4 from the fen peat appeared to be predominately from the acetoclastic pathway, while in the bog peat a strong CH4 oxidation signal was present despite the anaerobic conditions of our incubations. There was no evidence that changes in soil quality have lead to differences in the dominant methanogenic pathways in these systems. Overall, our results suggest that even relatively short-term changes in climate can alter the quality of peat in bogs and fens, which could alter the response of peatland carbon and nitrogen mineralization to future climate change.

AB Wetlands in general and mires in particular belong to the most important terrestrial carbon stocks globally. Mires (i.e. bogs, transition bogs and fens) are assumed to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they depend on specific, namely cool and humid, climatic conditions. In this paper, we use distribution data of the nine mire types to be found in Austria and habitat distribution models for four IPCC scenarios to evaluate climate change induced risks for mire ecosystems within the 21st century. We found that climatic factors substantially contribute to explain the current distribution of all nine Austrian mire ecosystem types. Summer temperature proved to be the most important predictor for the majority of mire ecosystems. Precipitation-mostly spring and summer precipitation sums-was influential for some mire ecosystem types which depend partly or entirely on ground water supply (e.g. fens). We found severe climate change induced risks for all mire ecosystems, with rain-fed bog ecosystems being most threatened. Differences between scenarios are moderate for the mid-21st century, but become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century, with near total loss of climate space projected for some ecosystem types (bogs, quagmires) under severe climate change. Our results imply that even under minimum expected, i.e. inevitable climate change, climatic risks for mires in Austria will be considerable. Nevertheless, the pronounced differences in projected habitat loss between moderate and severe climate change scenarios indicate that limiting future warming will likely contribute to enhance long-term survival of mire ecosystems, and to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing peat. Effectively stopping and reversing the deterioration of mire ecosystems caused by conventional threats can be regarded as a contribution to climate change mitigation. Because hydrologically intact mires are more resilient to climatic changes, this would also maintain the nature conservation value of mires, and help to reduce the severe climatic risks to which most Austrian mire ecosystems may be exposed in the 2nd half of the 21st century according to IPCC scenarios.

AB Northern peatlands are a large repository of atmospheric carbon due to an imbalance between primary production by plants and microbial decomposition. The James Bay Lowlands (JBL) of northern Ontario are a large peatland-complex but remain relatively unstudied. Climate change models predict the region will experience warmer and drier conditions, potentially altering plant community composition, and shifting the region from a long-term carbon sink to a source. We collected a peat core from two geographically separated (ca. 200 km) ombrotrophic peatlands (Victor and Kinoje Bogs) and one minerotrophic peatland (Victor Fen) located near Victor Bog within the JBL. We characterized (i) archaeal, bacterial, and fungal community structure with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of ribosomal DNA, (ii) estimated microbial activity using community level physiological profiling and extracellular enzymes activities, and (iii) the aeration and temperature dependence of carbon mineralization at three depths (0-10, 50-60, and 100-110 cm) from each site. Similar dominant microbial taxa were observed at all three peatlands despite differences in nutrient content and substrate quality. In contrast, we observed differences in basal respiration, enzyme activity, and the magnitude of substrate utilization, which were all generally higher at Victor Fen and similar between the two bogs. However, there was no preferential mineralization of carbon substrates between the bogs and fens. Microbial community composition did not correlate with measures of microbial activity but pH was a strong predictor of activity across all sites and depths. Increased peat temperature and aeration stimulated CO2 production but this did not correlate with a change in enzyme activities. Potential microbial activity in the JBL appears to be influenced by the quality of the peat substrate and the presence of microbial inhibitors, which suggests the existing peat substrate will have a large influence on future JBL carbon dynamics.

AB Northern peatlands store approximately one-third of the terrestrial soil carbon (C), although they cover only 3% of the global land mass. Northern peatlands can be subdivided into bogs and fens based on their hydrology and biogeochemistry. Peat/and hydrology and biogeochemistry are tightly coupled to climate and, therefore, may be very sensitive to climate variability and change. To address the fate of the large peatland soil C storage under a future changed climate, a peatland C model, the McGill Wetland Model (MWM), was coupled to a land surface climate model (the wetland version of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme, CL4SS3W), referred as CLASS3W-MWM. We evaluated the CL4SS3W-MWM for a bog (Mer Bleue, located at 45.41 degrees N, 75.48 degrees W, in eastern Canada) and a poor fen (Degero Stormyr, located at 64 degrees 11'N, 19 degrees 33'E, in northern Sweden).
   CLASS3W-MWM captured the magnitude and direction of the present day C cycling very well for both bogs and fens. Moreover, the seasonal and interannual variability were reproduced reasonably well. Root mean square errors (RMSE) were <0.65 and the degree of agreements (d*) were >0.8 for the components of net ecosystem production (NEP) for both the Mer Bleue bog and the Degero Stormyr fen. The performance of the coupled model for both bog and fen is similar to that of the stand-alone MWM driven by observed weather rather than simulated surface and soil climate. This modelling study suggests that northern peatlands are hydrologically and thermally conservative ecosystems. It was also shown that C cycling for bogs and fens was more sensitive to changes in air temperature than precipitation. Changes in temperature within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected range switch the peatlands from a present-day C sink to a source, but projected changes in precipitation still maintain the peatlands as a C sink, although to a somewhat lesser degree. Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration enhances C sequestration for both bogs and fens. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that northern peatlands respond to changes in temperature, precipitation and doubled CO2 concentration in a highly non-linear way. The sensitivity of C cycling in northern peatlands with respect to changes in air temperature, precipitation and the concentration of atmospheric CO2 together is not a simple addition or subtraction of the sensitivity of the individual changes. Therefore, the sensitivity of a combination of changes in temperature, precipitation and doubled CO2 concentration is very different from the sensitivity of peatlands to each environmental variable on their own. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that fens have a narrower tolerance to climate changes than bogs.

AB 1 A general model of peatland dynamics is presented that emphasizes the interaction between water table depth and peat production. The model consists of two coupled, non-linear differential equations representing change in depth of peat and depth to the water table. Several simplified models are also considered to show the logical development of this model from previously published ones. The model provides an integrated view of how peatlands function over long time scales, by focusing on the non-linear interactions among peat production, decomposition and hydrology.
   2 Analysis of the model shows that equilibrium peat accumulation and water table depth depend on the net water input to the peatland. In drier sites, peatlands with relatively deep water tables develop and the equilibrium peat depth increases with increasing water input. In very wet conditions, peatlands have water tables near the surface, peat accumulation is limited by low production rates, and equilibrium peat depth is lower than is possible in comparatively drier sites. Over a range of intermediate water balances, there are two simultaneous equilibrium states where deep, dry peatlands and shallower, wet peatlands can both occur. This sensitivity to water balance suggests that small changes in precipitation regime, such as are expected with climate variability and change, could rapidly convert peatlands that are now in equilibrium into either sources or sinks of carbon.

AB NORTHERN peatlands can act as either important sources or sinks for atmospheric carbon(1,2). It is therefore important to understand how carbon cycling in these regions will respond to a changing climate. Existing carbon balance models for peatlands assume that fluid flow and advective mass transport are negligible at depth(3,4), and that the effects of climate change should be essentially limited to the near-surface. Here we report the response of groundwater flow and porewater chemistry in the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands of northern Minnesota to the regional drought cycle. Comparison of held observations and numerical simulations indicates that climate fluctuations of short duration may temporarily reverse the vertical direction of fluid flow through the peat, although this has little effect on water chemistry(5). On the other hand, periods of drought persisting for at least 3-5 years produce striking changes in the chemistry of the pore water. These longer-term changes in hydrology influence the flux of nutrients and dissolved organic matter through the deeper peat, and therefore affect directly the rates of fermentation and methanogenesis, and the export of dissolved carbon compounds from the peatland.

AB We examined how hydrology influenced water chemistry, vegetation, nutrient status, aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and litter decomposition rates in two mires on the South-Eastern Alps of Italy. One of the mires had a modest hydraulic gradient and prevalently acted as a recharge system, although there were short phases of vertical flow reversal during dry periods. This mire was, therefore, prevalently fed by rainwater and was covered by bog-like vegetation, mainly hummocks and scrubs with a ground layer rich in Sphagnum mosses. The other mire presented a steeper hydraulic gradient, with the surface being fed by mineral water either by surface runoff or by vertical, upwards directed ground water flow. Compared to the bog-dominated mire, the pore water was less acidic and richer in telluric cations. This mire was covered by fen-like vegetation, prevalently fen meadows. Nitrogen (N) content in the vegetation was very similar in the two mire sites, while phosphorus (P) content was lower in the fen-dominated site. Contrary to our expectations. ANPP did not differ significantly between the two mire sites while litter decomposition rates were significantly lower in the fen-dominated mire, presumably because of P limitation of decomposers. This suggests that the development of ombrogenous mires in this region need not be due to increased accumulation of peat during succession from mineralwater-fed to rainwater-fed conditions.

AB We undertook a survey of the vegetational ecology of 94 peatlands at Duck Mountain, Manitoba to discriminate differences among peatland types at the southeastern edge of the boreal plain, especially black spruce swamps, and to clarify boreal swamp terminology. The majority of peatlands surveyed were wooded, relatively small (mean = 1.8 ha), and in depressions on the landscape. A classification and indicator species analysis identified the dominant peatland types as moderate-rich fens, with bogs and extreme-rich fens as rare. Black spruce swamps were relatively common and often found on gentle slopes. They were distinguished from wooded fens by larger trees (mean height = 9.7 m; diameter = 12.6 cm), denser overstory (68%), shallower peat depth (90 cm), and small size (1.6 ha). Although most similar to wooded moderate-rich fens by vegetation, black spruce swamps have a denser bryophyte layer and more mesic plant species. Significant indicator species on hummocks and drier areas include Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens, Equisetum sylvaticum, Petasites frigidus var. palmatus, Comus canadensis, Linnaea borealis, Rosa acicularis, Moneses uniflora, Geocaulon lividum, Orthillia secunda, Equisetum arvense, Listera cordata, and Mertensia paniculata. Species characteristically found in black spruce swamp hollows include Rhizomnium pseudopunctatum, Rhizomnium gracile, and Plagiochila porelloides. We discuss conifer swamp terminology globally, and recommend that black spruce swamps be recognized as a peatland type distinct from eastern white cedar-dominated boreal swamps found in the eastern boreal region, wooded fens, and black spruce-dominated uplands. The environmental gradients most strongly associated with an ordination of the Duck Mountain peatland plant community data were forest mensuration variables, e.g., overstory density (range = 7-80%), peat depth (0.4-+3.0 m), peat C:N (14-67), organic C (54-98%), bulk density (0.19-64.00 g/cc), surface-water temperature (3.0-19.5 degrees C), specific conductivity (0-989 mu S/cm), and Ca2+ (1.8-111.4 mg/L). Wooded bogs were distinguished from the other peatland types based on mean pH (3.8), alkalinity (0.2 mg/L), Ca2+ (5.0 mg/L) and other cations, but there was much overlap among the fens and black spruce swamp. A number of isolated, topographically high, open peatlands were characterized by plant species with affinities to open moderate-rich fens, including Drepanocladus aduncus, Helodium blandowii, Salix discolor, Equisetum fluviatile, and Calamagrostis canadensis, but mean surface water pH (5.4), Ca2+ (13 mg/L), DOC (47 mg/L), and NH4+ (188 mu g/L) were more similar to wooded bogs. This may be the consequence of fluctuating water levels. The potential impact of climate change, in addition to current impacts from logging, emphasizes the importance of understanding the vegetation and environmental variables in southern boreal peatlands.

AB Northern peatlands hold large amounts of organic carbon (C) in their soils and are as such important in a climate change context. Blanket bogs, i.e. nutrient-poor peatlands restricted to maritime climates, may be extra vulnerable to global warming since they require a positive water balance to sustain their moss dominated vegetation and C sink functioning. This study presents a 4.5 year record of land-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange from the Andoya blanket bog in northern Norway. Compared with other peatlands, the Andoya peatland exhibited low flux rates, related to the low productivity of the dominating moss and lichen communities and the maritime settings that attenuated seasonal temperature variations. It was observed that under periods of high vapour pressure deficit, net ecosystem exchange was reduced, which was mainly caused by a decrease in gross primary production. However, no persistent effects of dry conditions on the CO2 exchange dynamics were observed, indicating that under present conditions and within the range of observed meteorological conditions the Andoya blanket bog retained its C uptake function. Continued monitoring of these ecosystem types is essential in order to detect possible effects of a changing climate.

AB 1 As peatlands form they create a temporal archive of community development, allowing the reconstruction of vegetation dynamics through the analysis of sediments and the development of detailed chronologies of successional change. Peatland formation occurs through two mechanisms: (i) terrestrialization, when a water body fills with sediments and peat; and (ii) paludification, the conversion of dry land to peatland. In temperate regions, where high summer temperatures may limit peat accumulation, general models of peatland development suggest that allogenic factors such as climate change control peatland development and that terrestrialization is the primary mechanism of formation.
   2 This study evaluates this widely accepted model by comparing the developmental histories of three peatlands within the same climate region in New England in order to: (i) describe the development and timing of successional events among peatlands; (ii) document the roles of paludification and terrestrialization as developmental mechanisms; and (iii) evaluate the importance of climate change vs. autogenic factors in peatland development in this temperate region.
   3 Basin morphometry, sediment stratigraphies, and chronologies of community change determined through radiocarbon dating indicate that peatland development at each site involved terrestrialization followed by paludification, with no apparent influence of broad-scale climate change on the timing of these processes. Paludification was consistently initiated coincident with the consolidation of a shrub mat across each lake-basin, and was controlled in extent and rate by the topography of the adjoining uplands. The timing of stratigraphic changes varied among sites, suggesting that autogenic factors associated with the accumulation of peat rather than regional climate change controlled development. These results provide the foundation for a model of temperate peatland development driven by autogenic factors and caution against the use of temperate peatland development as a proxy for climatic reconstruction.

AB Peatlands are major ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere and have a significant role in global biogeochemical processes. Consequently, there is growing interest in understanding past, present and future peatland dynamics. However, chronological and geographical data on peatland initiation are scattered, impeding the reliable establishment of postglacial spatiotemporal peatland formation patterns and their possible connection to climate. In order to present a comprehensive account of postglacial peatland formation histories in North America and northern Europe, we collected a data set of 1400 basal peat ages accompanied by below-peat sediment-type interpretations from literature. Our data indicate that all peatland initiation processes (i.e. primary mire formation, terrestrialization and paludification) co-occurred throughout North America and northern Europe during the Holocene, and almost equal amounts of peatlands formed via these three processes. Furthermore, the data suggest that the processes exhibited some spatiotemporal patterns. On both continents, primary mire formation seems to occur first, soon followed by terrestrialization and later paludification. Primary mire formation appears mostly restricted to coastal areas, whereas terrestrialization and paludification were more evenly distributed across the continents. Primary mire formation seems mainly connected with physical processes, such as ice sheet retreat. Terrestrialization probably reflected progressive infilling of water bodies on longer timescales but was presumably drought driven on shorter timescales. Paludification seems affected by climate as it slowed down in Europe during the driest phase of the Holocene between 6 and 5 ka. Lateral expansion of existing peatlands accelerated c. 5000 years ago on both continents, which was likely connected to an increase in relative moisture.

AB It remains uncertain how the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of diverse peatlands will respond to warming. Here we compare five years of eddy covariance measurements of NEE and estimates of gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration between a fen dominated by deciduous vegetation and an adjacent bog with evergreen vegetation in the Canadian Hudson Bay Lowlands. At the bog, daily net CO2 uptake lasted from snowmelt to snow cover onset, while at the fen, net CO2 uptake was delayed in spring and ended earlier in fall. Greater midsummer net CO2 uptake at the fen compensated for shoulder season net CO2 losses resulting in similar annual NEE at the two sites (fen: -52 +/- 16 g C m(-2), bog: -80 +/- 14 g C m(-2)). Observations of a satellite-based productivity index also suggest lower shoulder season and higher peak vegetation productivity at these deciduous versus evergreen plant-dominated peatlands. The response of NEE to warmer weather differed between sites. Warming during the shoulder seasons increased net CO2 uptake at the evergreen plant-dominated bog, while it increased net CO2 losses at the fen where deciduous leaves had not yet emerged or had senesced. In contrast, warmer weather during the peak growing season appeared to reduce net CO2 uptake more at the bog than the fen resulting from both increasing ecosystem respiration and decreasing gross primary productivity. In the short term, warming will likely decrease annual net CO2 uptake of these and similar peatlands, although the magnitude will depend on factors including vegetation dynamics and seasonality of warming.

AB Under changing climatic conditions permafrost peatlands can play an important role in the global carbon budget through permafrost carbon feedbacks and shifts in carbon assimilation. To better predict future dynamics in these ecosystems an increased understanding of their Holocene carbon and permafrost history is needed. In Tavvavuoma, northern Sweden, we have performed detailed analyses of vegetation succession and geochemical properties at six permafrost peatland sites. Peatland initiation took place around 10000 to 9600cal. a BP, soon after retreat of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, and the peatlands have remained permafrost-free fens throughout most of the Holocene. At the four sites that showed a continuous accumulation record during the late Holocene radiocarbon dating of the shift from wet fen to dry bog vegetation, characteristic of the present permafrost peatland surface, suggests that permafrost developed at around 600-100cal. a BP. At the other two sites peat accumulation was halted during the late Holocene, possibly due to abrasion, making it more difficult to imply the timing of permafrost aggradation. However also at these sites there are no indications of permafrost inception prior to the Little Ice Age. The mean long-term Holocene carbon accumulation rate at all six sites was 12.3 +/- 2.4 gC m(-2) a(-1) (+/- SD), and the mean soil organic carbon storage was 114 +/- 27kg m(-2).

AB The temperate peatlands are extensive, covering around 3.5 million km(2) of land. They contain about 455 Gt of carbon, almost equivalent to the carbon stored in all of the living things on the surface of the planet, and representing around 25% of all the soil carbon on earth. These bogs are a sink for atmospheric carbon and their carbon uptake accounts for about 12% of current human emissions. They vary considerably in their form and structure and are an important resource for scientific research, including the study of past environments and climate change, and they are also valuable in environmental education. They are low in biodiversity, but their fauna and flora are distinctive and many groups are confined to this habitat. For all these reasons, the future conservation of peatlands is a matter for concern. Threats to peatlands come from direct human exploitation in the form of peat harvesting for energy and horticulture, and drainage for forestry. Rising environmental awareness should control both of these processes in the western world, but continued northern peatland losses are likely locally, especially in Asia. Peatland drainage for forestry or agriculture will result in losses of carbon to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. Human population pressures, industrialization and urbanization are unlikely to have an important direct and immediate influence in the boreal zone. Fragmentation of the habitat is not an important consideration because bogs are by their very nature 'island' habitats. Acidification by aerial pollution may be a local problem close to sources, but the habitat is naturally acid and should not be severely affected, The input of aerial nutrients, however, particularly nitrogen, could have widespread impact on bogs, enhancing their productivity and altering their vegetation composition. The physical rehabilitation of bogs damaged by human activities presents many problems, particularly relating to the re-establishment of peat structure and vegetation, but the process can result in the re-formation of a carbon sink so it is worth the effort. Climate change is the most important consideration in its impact on bogs. Higher temperature (especially if accompanied by raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and increased nitrate deposition) will enhance productivity, but will also result in faster decomposition rates. The outcome of these opposing factors for peat formation will ultimately depend on the future pattern of precipitation. If, as seems most likely, summer conditions become warmer and drier in continental regions and winters become milder and wetter, the summer drought could cause peat loss and bog contraction. An excess of decomposition will lead to bogs becoming a carbon source and thus a positive feedback in global warming. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide would add to the greenhouse gas problem, but likely oxidation of methane and low N(2)O production may well mean that this impact will not prove to be significant. Tree invasion of bogs as a consequence of summer drought could locally lead to increased water loss through transpiration, and higher heat absorption through albedo change. This will enhance the drying effect on the bog surface. Oceanic mires will be less severely affected if the expected increase in precipitation takes place in these regions. The most important overall factor in determining the future of the northern bogs is likely to be the quantity and pattern (both spatially and temporally) of future precipitation in the zone.

AB A process-based model was developed and validated to predict the regional dynamics of the water table (WT) in peatlands under climatic forcing. The model detailed the water-energy feedbacks in the common SVAT (soil-vegetation-atmosphere transportation) model and specified the differences in processes in pristine fens, pristine bogs and drained peatlands. The spatiotemporal changes in the WT of the peatlands throughout Finland were computed based on 10 km x 10 km grids for the period 2000-2099. The calculations used country-scale data on vegetation, catchment topography and profiles of peat bulk density and water content in the three mire types. Furthermore, the ACCLIM climate scenarios representing the current climate and the changing climate were used to identify the climatic impacts on the WT throughout Finland.
   Sensitivity analysis showed that the WT drawdown in pristine fens was most sensitive to increases in temperature and/or decreases in precipitation, whereas the WT drawdown in drained peatlands was the most resistant to such changes. For all three mire types, a 10% increase in precipitation based on the current climate tended to offset the effect of a 2 degrees C warming on WT drawdown and a 20% increase in precipitation tended to offset the WT drawdown caused by a 6 degrees C warming. Based on the ACCLIM climate scenario, the model showed moderate changes in the annual values of the WT, which ranged from +0.2 +/- 1.5 to -4.3 +/- 0.93 cm. The changes were most noticeable during the period 2060-2099. The drawdown was more pronounced in late spring than in summer and autumn. Additionally, the WT drawdown was most significant in the western parts of the northern aapa-mire region, where the peatlands were mostly pristine, and the increase of precipitation was more limited than in other parts of the country. These results show that the pronounced spatiality and temporality in the WT changes should be considered in studies addressing how climate change will affect mire ecosystems in terms of C balance and GHG emissions.

AB We compared nitrogen (N) storage and flux in soils from an ombrotrophic bog with that of a minerotrophic ten to quantity the differences in N cycling between these two peatlands types in northern Minnesota (USA). Precipitation, atmospheric deposition, and bog and ten outflows were analyzed for nitrogen species. Upland and peatland soil samples were analyzed for N content, and for ambient (DN) and potential (DEA) denitrification rates. Annual atmospheric deposition was: 0.88-3.07 kg NH4+ ha(-1) y(-1); 1.37-1.42 kg NO3- ha(-1) y(-1); 2.79-4.69 kg TN ha(-1) y(-1). Annual N outflows were: bog -0.01-0.04 kg NH4+ ha(-1) y(-1), NO3- 0.01-0.06 kg ha(-1) y(-1) and TN 0.11-0.69 kg ha(-1) y(-1); fen-NH4+ 0.01-0.16 kg ha(-1) y(-1), NO3- 0.29-0.48 kg ha(-1) y(-1), and TN 1.14-1.61 kg ha(-1) y(-1). Soil N content depended on location within the bog or fen, and on soil depth. DN and DEA rates were low throughout the uplands and peatlancls, and were correlated with atmospheric N deposition, soil N storage, and N outflow. DEA was significantly greater than DN indicating C or N limitation of the denitrification process. We highlight differences between the bog and fen, between the upland mineral soils and peat, and the importance of biogeochemical hotspots within the peatlands. We point out the importance of organic N storage, as a source of N for denitrification, and propose a plausible link between organic N storage, denitrification and N export from peatlands. Finally, we considered the interactions of microbial metabolism with nutrient availability and stoichiometry, and how N dynamics might be affected by climate change in peatland ecosystems.

AB Although recent studies have recognized peatlands as a sink for atmospheric CO2, little is known about the role of Siberian peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We have estimated the Holocene peat and carbon accumulation rate in the peatlands of the southern taiga and subtaiga zones of western Siberia. We explain the accumulation rates by calculating the average peat accumulation rate and the long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) and by using the model of Clymo (1984, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B 303, 605-654). At three key areas in the southern taiga and subtaiga zones we studied eight sites, at which the dry bulk density, ash content, and carbon content were measured every 10 cm. Age was established by radiocarbon dating. The average peat accumulation rate at the eight sites varied from 0.35 +/- 0.03 to 1.13 +/- 0.02 mm yr(-1) and the LORCA values of bogs and fens varied from 19.0 +/- 1.1 to 69.0 +/- 4.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The accumulation rates had different trends especially during the early Holocene, caused by variations in vegetation succession resulting in differences in peat and carbon accumulation rates. The indirect effects of climate change through local hydrology appeared to be more important than direct influences of changes in precipitation and temperature. River valley fens were more drained during wetter periods as a result of deeper river incision, while bogs became wetter. From our dry bulk density results and our age-depth profiles we conclude that compaction is negligible and decay was not a relevant factor for undrained peatlands. These results contribute to our understanding of the influence of peatlands on the global carbon cycle and their potential impact on global change. (C) 2003 University of Washington.

AB Peatlands, including fens, are important ecosystems in the context of the global carbon cycle. Future climate change and other anthropogenic activities are likely to increase nutrient loading in many peatland ecosystems and a better understanding of the effects of these nutrients on peatland carbon cycling is necessary. We investigated the effects of six years of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization, along with liming, on carbon mineralization dynamics in an intermediate fen in northern Minnesota. Specifically, we measured CO2 and CH4 emission from intact peat cores, as well as CH4 production and CH4 consumption at multiple depths in short-term laboratory incubations. Despite increased nitrogen and phosphorus availability in the upper 5 cm of peat, increased pH, and clear shifts in the vegetation community, fertilization and liming had limited effects on microbial carbon cycling in this fen. Liming reduced the net flux Of CO2 approximately 3-fold compared to the control treatment, but liming had no effect on CH4 emissions from intact cores. There were no nutrient effects on CO2 or CH4 emissions from intact cores. In all treatments, rates of CH4 production increased with depth and rates of CH4 consumption were highest near the in situ water-table level. However, nutrient and liming had no effect on rates of CH4 production or CH4 consumption at any depth. Our results suggest that over at least the intermediate term, the microbial communities responsible for soil carbon cycling in this peatland are tolerant to wide ranges of nutrient concentrations and pH levels and may be relatively insensitive to future anthropogenic nutrient stress.

AB Peatlands cover a small portion of the Earth's land surface but hold similar to 30% of soil carbon (C) globally. However, few studies have focused on the early stage of peatland development, which is a key stage in the initial C sink function of peatlands. An immature peatland is vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions, e.g., temperature and water conditions, as the peat accumulation process can be easily interrupted by such changes. It is important to understand how immature peatlands develop, what conditions are beneficial to this process, and the present status of these important peatlands. Plant macrofossil analysis and geochemical characteristics of peat were used to determine the plant succession and the degree of decomposition at two peatlands developing in the Changbai Mountain region of northeastern China. The results show that during the entire plant community succession, plants in the two studied peatlands are mainly characterized by sedges (Cyperaceae) and mosses (mainly Sphagnum). Plans macrofossil analysis reveals a wetter trend in the Yuan Lake (YL) peatland in the most upper parr of peat layer, which provides favorable conditions for peal accumulation and peatland development. The C/N ratios of core Chi Lake (CL) show a steady peal decomposition and accumulation process in the CL peatland. Additionally, there was a clear impact of presence of Sphagnum on the variations in the C. ratio. In the YL peatland, macro-charcoal pieces indicated that fire events during dry hydrological conditions had great effects on biogeochemical processes within the peatland, affecting peat decomposition and the succession of the local plant community. An increase in major and trace elements suggests only weak disturbance due to the considerable distance to human settlements. This study determines the characteristics of pristine mountainous peatlands and highlights the importance of understanding the regular plant community in the early stage of peatland formation, as well as its potential effects on C sinks.

AB We present a record of peatland development in relation to climate changes and human activities from the Palomaa mire, a remote site in northern Finland. We used fine-resolution and continuous sampling to analyse several proxies including pollen (for vegetation on and around the mire), testate amoebae (TA; for mire-wetness changes), oxygen and carbon isotopes from Sphagnum cellulose (18O and 13C; for humidity and temperature changes), peat-accumulation rates and peat-colour changes. In spite of an excellent accumulation model (30 14C dates and estimated standard deviation of sample ages <1 year in the most recent part), the potential to determine causeeffect (or leadlag) relationships between environmental changes and biotic responses is limited by proxy-specific incorporation processes below the actively growing Sphagnum surface. Nevertheless, what emerges is that mire development was closely related to water-table changes rather than to summer temperature and that water-table decreases were associated with increasing peat-accumulation rates and more abundant mire vegetation. A rapid fen-to-bog transition occurred within a few years around AD 1960 when the water table decreased beyond the historical minimum, supporting the notion that mires can rapidly shift into bogs in response to allogenic factors.

AB Sphagnum-dominated peatland ecosystems that are structurally and functionally similar to their boreal and subarctic counterparts are found as far south as West Virginia. Completed, ongoing, and preliminary studies conducted at Bog Run Bog, WV, Bog Lake Bog, MN, and Wetland 307 of the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario have included 1) a reciprocal transplant of dominant hummock and hollow Sphagnum species, examining growth in length, 2) a reciprocal transplant of peat, with periodic retrieval of transplanted samples and analysis of CO2 and CH4 production under anoxic and oxic conditions at held temperature and at 22 degrees C, 3) C-14-labeling of vegetation in hollow, hummock, and shrub plots, following the fate of a single day's photosynthetic fixation through aboveground and belowground components over time, and 4) a preliminary analysis of C-13 ratios in peat and of the CH4 that is produced and emitted. Collectively, these studies provide support for the premise that comparative studies of northern (cooler climate) and southern (warmer climate) peatland sites may provide insights into potential functional changes in boreal peatlands under predicted scenarios of global climate change.

AB Ombrotrophic peatlands are those that are purely fed by precipitation and are unconnected to groundwaters. Identification of ombrotophic peatlands is of interest because of their utility as a depositional archive, their unique botanical characteristics, and their sensitivity to climate change. Seven high elevation peatlands in the Catskill Mountains of New York state are investigated in this paper; six of these are identified as ombrotrophic bogs and one is determined to be a minerotrophic (groundwater-fed) poor fen. In order to identify these peatlands as ombrotrophic, concentrations of major ions in surface pools are examined; the proportion of calcium and magnesium in surface pools is particularly indicative of ombrotrophy. Average Ca/Mg (mg L-1) ratios in bogs, precipitation, and springs are 4.3, 5.0, and 6.7, respectively. Stable isotopes of water (deuterium and O-18) are examined as well and may provide a novel method of determining the water source to peatlands; peatland isotopic data plot along what appears to be a local evaporation line.

AB Carbon and peat accumulation rates over the past 1200 yr were measured in relation to permafrost aggradation, maturity, ground fires, and degradation in a peatland with discontinuous permafrost near Fort Simpson, N.W.T., Canada. The White River volcanic ash layer, deposited 1200 yr ago, was used as a chronostratigraphic marker to compare peat and carbon accumulation among peat cores collected along transects over a consistent period of time. The aggradation of permafrost results in a change from unfrozen bog to forested peat plateau, and approximate decreases of 50 and 65% in carbon and vertical peat accumulation rates, respectively. Carbon and peat accumulation continue to decrease significantly with both increasing permafrost maturity and the number of ground fires. The transition from peat plateau to collapse bog through internal permafrost degradation results in up to a 72 and 200% increase in carbon and vertical peat accumulation rates, respectively. Permafrost degradation at the margins of a peat plateau can result in the formation of collapse fens, in which vertical peat accumulation increases significantly yet the carbon accumulation rates remain similar to the peat plateau. A warming climate may result in a shift towards higher carbon accumulation rates in peatlands associated with bog vegetation following pear plateau collapse, yet warmer peat temperatures, greater soil aeration, greater rates of peat decomposition, and an increase in burning may provide limits to the increase.

AB Questions Peatland ecosystems are a globally important carbon storage that is predicted to turn into a carbon source due to water level drawdown (WLD) associated with climate change. The predictions assume stable plant communities but how realistic is this assumption? If the vegetation is not stable, what are the nature and rate of changes? Location Peatland complex in Southern Finland. Methods We conducted a water level drawdown (WLD of 10 cm) experiment over 17 years in three peatland types differing in their fertility. On each peatland type, we included an adjacent forestry drained (FD, with water table ca. 40 cm lower than in control) area for comparison. Results Peatland type had a clear impact on the response to WLD: at the ecosystem level, the two minerotrophic fens underwent rapid species turnover, while the vegetation in nutrient-poor bog was more resilient to change. In nutrient-rich sites, WLD initiated tree canopy development and created understorey conditions that strengthened impact of WLD. In nutrient-poor site, tree establishment was seen only in the FD area. In addition to high nutrient level, high wetness accelerated change at the plant community level, where we found three types of responses: accelerating change, decelerating change, and stability. Succession resulted in an overall loss of community heterogeneity. Conclusions Interaction between hydrology, nutrient availability, and biological factors in boreal peatlands is important: the drop in water table required to achieve the shift from open peatland to forested system is inversely proportional to the nutrient level of the system. The results suggest that predictive models of peatland functions under climate change should consider compositional change for fens and their diverse plant communities but are more realistic for bogs. The response of bog vegetation to climate change may, however, be more dependent on changes in rainfall regime and therefore needs to be further addressed.

AB Northern peatlands are projected to be crucial in future atmospheric methane (CH4) budgets and have a positive feedback on global warming. Fens receive nutrients from catchments via inflowing water and are more sensitive than bogs to variations in their ecohydrology. Yet, due to a lack of data detailing the impacts of moving water on microhabitats and CH4 fluxes in fens, large uncertainties remain with respect to predicting CH4 emissions from these sites under climate changes. We measured CH4 fluxes with manual chambers over three growing seasons (2017-2019) at a northern boreal fen. To address the spatial variation at the site where a stream flows through the long and narrow valley fen, we established sample plots at varying distances from the stream. To link the variations in CH4 emissions to environmental controls, we quantified water levels, peat temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, vegetation composition, and leaf area index in combination with flux measurements during the growing season in 2019. We found that due to the flowing water, there was a higher water level, cooler peat temperatures, and more oxygen in the peat close to the stream, which also had the highest total leaf area and gross primary production (GPP) values but the lowest CH4 emissions. CH4 emissions were highest at an intermediate distance from the stream where the oxygen concentration in the surface peat was low but GPP was still high. Further from the stream, the conditions were drier and produced low CH4 emissions. Our results emphasize the key role of ecohydrology in CH4 dynamics in fens and, for the first time, show how a stream controls CH4 emissions in a flow-through fen. As valley fens are common peatland ecosystems from the Arctic to the temperate zones, future projections of global CH4 budgets need to take flowing water features into account.

AB Boreal peatlands may be particularly vulnerable to climate change, because temperature regimes that currently constrain biological activity in these regions are predicted to increase substantially within the next century. Changes in peatland plant community composition in response to climate change may alter nutrient availability, energy budgets, trace gas fluxes, and carbon storage. We investigated plant community response to warming and drying in a field mesocosm experiment in northern Minnesota, USA. Large intact soil monoliths removed from a bog and a fen received three infrared warming treatments crossed with three water-table treatments (n = 3) for five years. Foliar cover of each species was estimated annually.
   In the bog, increases in soil temperature and decreases in water-table elevation increased cover of shrubs by 50% and decreased cover of graminoids by 50%. The response of shrubs to warming was distinctly species-specific, and ranged from increases (for Andromeda glaucophylla ) to decreases (for Kalmia polifolia ). In the fens, changes in plant cover were driven primarily by changes in water-table elevation, and responses were species- and lifeform-specific: increases in water-table elevation increased cover of graminoids - in particular Carex lasiocarpa and Carex livida - as well as mosses. In contrast, decreases in water-table elevation increased cover of shrubs, in particular A. glaucophylla and Chamaedaphne calyculata . The differential and sometimes opposite response of species and lifeforms to the treatments suggest that the structure and function of both bog and fen plant communities will change - in different directions or at different magnitudes - in response to warming and/or changes in water-table elevation that may accompany regional or global climate change.

AB Northern mires (fens and bogs) have significant climate feedbacks and contribute to biodiversity, providing habitats to specialized biota. Many studies have found drying and degradation of bogs in response to climate change, while northern fens have received less attention. Rich fens are particularly important to biodiversity, but subject to global climate change, fen ecosystems may change via direct response of vegetation or indirectly by hydrological changes. With repeated sampling over the past 20 years, we aim to reveal trends in hydrology and vegetation in a pristine boreal fen with gradient from rich to poor fen and bog vegetation. We resampled 203 semi-permanent plots and compared water-table depth (WTD), pH, concentrations of mineral elements, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), plant species occurrences, community structure, and vegetation types between 1998 and 2018. In the study area, the annual mean temperature rose by 1.0 degrees C and precipitation by 46 mm, in 20-year periods prior to sampling occasions. We found that wet fen vegetation decreased, while bog and poor fen vegetation increased significantly. This reflected a trend of increasing abundance of common, generalist hummock species at the expense of fen specialist species. Changes were the most pronounced in high pH plots, where Sphagnum mosses had significantly increased in plot frequency, cover, and species richness. Changes of water chemistry were mainly insignificant in concentration levels and spatial patterns. Although indications toward drier conditions were found in vegetation, WTD had not consistently increased, instead, our results revealed complex dynamics of WTD as depending on vegetation changes. Overall, we found significant trend in vegetation, conforming to common succession pattern from rich to poor fen and bog vegetation. Our results suggest that responses intrinsic to vegetation, such as increased productivity or altered species interactions, may be more significant than indirect effects via local hydrology to the ecosystem response to climate warming.

AB Climate change in the subarctic region has increased the rate of inundation of peatlands due to increased temperatures, precipitation, and permafrost thaw. Increased inundation may result in vegetation community shifts, as documented in a subarctic mire near Abisko, Sweden. The wet fen communities have established in former sphagnum areas, and sphagnum colonized in degraded palsa hummocks. At Stordalen mire, we studied the influence of vegetation community on chemical composition of peat soil organic matter (SOM). Vegetation and soil samples were obtained along a hydrologic gradient with representative communities: palsa, sphagnum, and fen. Soil organic matter chemical composition indicated shifts in vegetative communities. Total N and N isotope signatures in fen soils showed characteristics of sphagnum and palsa communities at >6-cm depth, and sphagnum soil profile signatures shifted from sphagnum to palsa properties at a 20-cm depth. Soil chemical composition measured by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed increasing recalcitrant C (alkyl and aromatic) in palsa soil. Sphagnum soil profiles sustained labile organic C (O-alkyl) until 15 cm then shifted to humified soil, and fen soil profiles showed areas of sphagnum and palsa signatures. Furthermore, the strong relationship between functional group C (O-alkyl and alkyl) and total N demonstrated that soil N is an effective indicator of peat decomposition. Our results identified change points in soil chemical composition in regards to N content and C functional group which highlights the importance of historic vegetation community on chemical composition of peat soils.

AB (1) I explore the hypothesis that the water regime is one of the major determinants of the difference between bog and fen in Sphagnum mires because of its effects on the decay loss and the mass accretion rate. This article deals with the recent mass balance and water regime and the variation in mass accretion rate during the last millennium, studied at two mires in southern Sweden.
   (2) At one bog site and one fen site in the Akhult mire the recent litter input to the acrotelm and mass accretion in the catotelm were 210 and 38 g m(-2) a(-1) at the bog site and 300 and 21 g m(-2) a(-1) at the fen site, respectively. The difference in productivity reflected the availability of plant nutrients and the pH. The smaller loss of mass at the bog site was a result of smaller water table amplitude and a higher median time water level (MTWL) than at the fen site. Through its effects on hummock formation, the water regime is also a major determinant of the surface structure.
   (3) Around 1000 cal. BP the precipitation and the supply of mineral soil water to the two sites increased and the bog vegetation of that time was replaced by fen vegetation. Mass accretion first increased to 180 g m(-2) a(-1) but with the upward growth of the mire surface the rate decreased. The recent conditions at the fen site became established similar to 800 cal. BP, probably as a result of increased water table amplitudes. At the bog site the water regime changed from geogenous to ombrogenous similar to 600 cal. BP, contemporary with a decrease in precipitation. This change resulted in a rapid increase in mass accretion by 150 % followed by a slow decrease until recent times with low values. The same development was found to have occurred twice at the Store Mosse mire. Such an initial increase in the peat accretion rate must be important for the formation of permanently ombrotrophic conditions in raised bogs.

AB Northern peatlands form a major soil carbon (C) stock. With climate change, peatland C mineralization is expected to increase, which in turn would accelerate climate change. A particularity of peatlands is the importance of soil aeration, which regulates peatland functioning and likely modulates the responses to warming climate. Our aim is to assess the impacts of warming on a southern boreal and a sub-arctic sedge fen carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange under two plausible water table regimes: wet and moderately dry. We focused this study on minerotrophic treeless sedge fens, as they are common peatland types at boreal and (sub)arctic areas, which are expected to face the highest rates of climate warming. In addition, fens are expected to respond to environmental changes faster than the nutrient poor bogs. Our study confirmed that CO2 exchange is more strongly affected by drying than warming. Experimental water level draw-down (WLD) significantly increased gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. Warming alone had insignificant impacts on the CO2 exchange components, but when combined with WLD it further increased ecosystem respiration. In the southern fen, CO2 uptake decreased due to WLD, which was amplified by warming, while at northern fen it remained stable. As a conclusion, our results suggest that a very small difference in the WLD may be decisive, whether the C sink of a fen decreases, or whether the system is able to adapt within its regime and maintain its functions. Moreover, the water table has a role in determining how much the increased temperature impacts the CO2 exchange.

AB Peatlands are significant global carbon stores and play an important role in mediating the flux of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. During the 20th century substantial areas of northern peatlands were drained to repurpose the land for industrial or agricultural use. Drained peatlands have dysfunctional microbial communities, which can lead to net carbon emissions. Rewetting of drained peatlands is therefore an environmental priority, yet our understanding of the effects of peatland drainage and rewetting on microbial communities is still incomplete. Here we summarize the last decade of research into the response of the wider microbial community, methane-cycling microorganisms, and micro-fauna to drainage and rewetting in fens and bogs in Europe and North America. Emphasis is placed on current research methodologies and their limitations. We propose targets for future work including: accounting for timescale of drainage and rewetting events; better vertical and lateral coverage of samples across a peatland; the integration of proteomic and metabolomic datasets into functional community analysis; the use of RNA sequencing to differentiate the active community from legacy DNA; and further study into the response of the viral and micro-faunal communities to peatland drainage and rewetting. This review should benefit researchers embarking on studies in wetland microbiology and non-microbiologists working on peatland drainage and rewetting in general.

AB Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that are extensive in the northern high latitudes where significant 21st century climate changes are expected. In response to climate change, peatlands may become a net source of greenhouse gases, thereby inducing a positive climate feedback effect. In this paper, the impact of precipitation variability and the mean climate state on long-term peat accumulation is investigated with model simulations. The models couple peat accumulation with the hydrological cycle, which results in peatland bistability, where peatlands may take the physical characteristics from one of two possible alternative stable states. The models consider precipitation as a stochastic forcing variable, temperature-dependent functions and are parameterized with climatology and peat characteristics to represent the West Siberian Lowlands (WSL) between 55 degrees N and 60 degrees N. Observed WSL peat depths statistically imply bistability. Peatland bistability, however, is eliminated in model simulations with moderate-to-large precipitation variability and warmer and wetter climates. This suggests that projected late 21st century climate change would put the thick peatlands in WSL on a transition to thin peatlands. The loss of thick peatlands could significantly increase atmospheric carbon dioxide and provide a positive climate feedback effect. However, the impacts depend on the importance of unaccounted stabilizing factors. The study also shows that precipitation variability induces peatlands to switch between extended periods of accumulation and depletion even if the peatlands are in long-term equilibrium. Thus, short-term observations may see only natural fluctuations and new, longer-term observational strategies are necessary to diagnose if peatlands are undergoing fundamental changes.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the effect of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat decomposition proxies in an ombrogenous peatland in the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL). We anticipated that drainage would change peatland hydrology, vegetation, and biogeochemistry, leading to an increase in peat decomposition. As indicators of peat biogeochemical change and potential proxies for peat decomposition, we compared peat porewater chemistry and in situ nutrient availability of different microforms in a pristine ombrogenous bog, with a bog that has been subject to gradual lowering of the water table by 20 to 80 cm for approximately 7 years prior to, and during, our study. We also examined the chemical composition of peat and peat leachates (organic matter) fromSphagnumand lichen-covered hummocks at each site. Nutrient availability was greater in pools at the drained bog, indicating mineralisation of the dry and bare peat surface. However, our results did not show evidence of significant peat biogeochemical change or advanced decomposition in hummocks at the drained bog, with no difference in nutrient availabilities, peat porewater chemistry, or peat leachate chemistry at the drained and pristine bog. We also found no significant difference in enzyme activity (phenol oxidases) in hummocks at each site, proposed to be an important factor for C loss from peatland ecosystems in drier conditions. Overall, the effects of drainage on peat properties, porewater chemistry, and peat chemical composition at our sites were small and varied for different vegetation-microform types. Although decomposition in drained peatlands is likely constrained by cool temperatures in the HBL, our results suggest that ecohydrological feedbacks at the microform scale may also be important in slowing decomposition in these peatlands.

AB We present the paleoecological development of a rich fen located in the dune area on the SE Baltic coast, during the last 7500 years. The Apuciems Mire hosts rare and endangered plant communities in Europe, such as Schoenus ferrugineus and Cladium mariscus. Analysis at high-resolution of plant macroremains in two peat cores was carried out to reconstruct local vegetation succession and fluctuations in moisture availability on the peatland, while a pollen record was developed to reconstruct plant succession, moisture variability and human activity at the regional scale. Based on the presence or the absence of macroremains of plants that occur in wet habitat e.g. Cladium mariscus, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Alisma plantago-aquatica and Botrycoccocus we distinguished four wet periods ca. 6000, 2000, 1750-1550, 1200-150 cal yr. BP and four dry periods (ca. 7000, 4600-4200, 1800-1750, 1550-1200 cal yr. BP) in the peatland's development. A water level increase at 1200 cal yr. BP triggered the development of plant communities containing Chara sp., Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, then Cladium mariscus. Our study shows a link between climate change at the regional scale and vegetation development in Apuciems Mire. We showed that changes in vegetation structure during last 150 years was caused by drainage and human activity.

AB The composition of a peatland plant community has considerable effect on a range of ecosystem functions. Peatland plant community structure is predicted to change under future climate change, making the quantification of the direction and magnitude of this change a research priority. We subjected intact, replicated vegetated poor fen peat monoliths to elevated temperatures, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and two water table levels in a factorial design to determine the individual and synergistic effects of climate change factors on the poor fen plant community composition. We identify three indicators of a regime shift occurring in our experimental poor fen system under climate change: nonlinear decline of Sphagnum at temperatures 8 degrees C above ambient conditions, concomitant increases in Carex spp. at temperatures 4 degrees C above ambient conditions suggesting a weakening of Sphagnum feedbacks on peat accumulation, and increased variance of the plant community composition and pore water pH through time. A temperature increase of +4 degrees C appeared to be a threshold for increased vascular plant abundance; however the magnitude of change was species dependent. Elevated temperature combined with elevated CO2 had a synergistic effect on large graminoid species abundance, with a 15 times increase as compared to control conditions. Community analyses suggested that the balance between dominant plant species was tipped from Sphagnum to a graminoid-dominated system by the combination of climate change factors. Our findings indicate that changes in peatland plant community composition are likely under future climate change conditions, with a demonstrated shift toward a dominance of graminoid species in poor fens.

AB Northern peatlands store a globally significant amount of soil organic carbon, much of it found in rapidly thawing permafrost. Permafrost thaw in peatlands often leads to the development and expansion of thermokarst bogs, where microbial activity will determine the stability of the carbon storage and the release of greenhouse gases. In this study, we compared potential enzyme activities between young (thawed similar to 30 years ago) and mature (similar to 200 years) thermokarst bogs, for both shallow and deep peat layers. We found very low potential enzyme activities in deep peat layers, with no differences between the young and mature bogs. Peat quality at depth was found to be highly humified (FTIR analysis) in both the young and mature bogs. This suggests that deep, old peat was largely stable following permafrost thaw, without a rapid pulse of decomposition during the young bog stage. For near-surface peat, we found significantly higher potential enzyme activities in the young bog than in the mature-associated with differences in peat quality derived from different Sphagnum species. A laboratory incubation of near-surface peat showed that differences in potential enzyme activity were primarily influenced by peat type rather than oxygen availability. This suggested that the young bog can have higher rates of near-surface decomposition despite being substantially wetter than the mature bog. Overall, our study shows that peat properties are the dominant constraint on potential enzyme activity and that peatland site development (successional pathways and permafrost history) through its influence on peat type and chemistry is likely to determine peat decomposition following permafrost thaw.

AB Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are designed for the study of past, present and future vegetation patterns together with associated biogeochemical cycles and climate feedbacks. However, most DGVMs do not yet have detailed representations of permafrost and non-permafrost peatlands, which are an important store of carbon, particularly at high latitudes. We demonstrate a new implementation of peatland dynamics in a customized "Arctic" version of the LPJ-GUESS DGVM, simulating the long-term evolution of selected northern peatland ecosystems and assessing the effect of changing climate on peatland carbon balance. Our approach employs a dynamic multi-layer soil with representation of freeze-thaw processes and litter inputs from a dynamically varying mixture of the main peatland plant functional types: mosses, shrubs and graminoids. The model was calibrated and tested for a sub-Arctic mire in Stordalen, Sweden, and validated at a temperate bog site in Mer Bleue, Canada. A regional evaluation of simulated carbon fluxes, hydrology and vegetation dynamics encompassed additional locations spread across Scandinavia. Simulated peat accumulation was found to be generally consistent with published data and the model was able to capture reported long-term vegetation dynamics, water table position and carbon fluxes. A series of sensitivity experiments were carried out to investigate the vulnerability of high-latitude peatlands to climate change. We found that the Stordalen mire may be expected to sequester more carbon in the first half of the 21st century due to milder and wetter climate conditions, a longer growing season, and the CO2 fertilization effect, turning into a carbon source after mid-century because of higher decomposition rates in response to warming soils.

AB High latitude peatlands act as globally important carbon (C) sinks and are in constant interaction with the atmosphere. Their C storage formed during the Holocene. In the course of time, the aggregate effect of the C fluxes on radiative forcing (RF) typically changes from warming to cooling, but the timing of this shift varies among different peatlands. Here we investigated Holocene peatland development, including vegetation history, vertical peat growth and the lateral expansion of a patterned subarctic fen in northern Finland by means of multiple sampling points. We modelled the Holocene RF by combining knowledge on past vegetation communities based on plant macrofossil stratigraphies and present in situ C flux measurements. The peatland initiated at ca. 9500 calibrated years Before Present (cal yr BP), and its lateral expansion was greatest between ca. 9000 and 7000 cal yr BP. After the early expansion, vertical peat growth proceeded very differently in different parts of the peatland, regulated by internal and external factors. The pronounced surface microtopography, with high strings and wet (larks, started to form only after ca. 1000 cal yr BP. C accumulation within the peatland recorded a high degree of spatial variability throughout its history, including the recent past. We applied two flux scenarios with different interpretation of the initial peatland development phases to estimate the RF induced by C fluxes of the fen. After ca. 4000 cal yr BP, at the latest, the peatland RF has been negative (cooling), mainly driven by C uptake and biomass production, while methane emissions had a lesser role in the total RF. Interestingly, these scenarios suggest that the greatest cooling effect took place around ca. 1000 cal yr BP, after which the surface microtopography established. The study demonstrated that despite the high spatial heterogeneity and idiosyncratic behaviour of the peatland, the RF of the studied fen followed the general development pattern of more southern peatlands. Holocene climate variations and warm phases did not seem to induce any distinctive and consistent peatland-scale patterns in C accumulation, whereas our data suggests that the changes in vegetation related to autogenic succession were reflected in the C accumulation patterns and RF more clearly.

AB Forested peatlands store significant amounts of soil carbon (C) compared with upland forests and are strongly influenced by climatic parameters. Carbon stocks at peatland margins, although likely to be most sensitive to changes in climate, have not been well quantified, making it difficult to predict their response to climate change. The purpose of this study was to characterize the physical environment and associated changes in C stocks across the forested margins of two boreal fens. Peat depth increased and water table depth decreased toward the peatland centre, and these parameters acted as the controlling environmental variables. Above-ground biomass C was primarily derived from tree biomass and decreased from upland to peadand, despite an opposite trend in understorey (herbaceous and shrubby) biomass stocks. Leaf area index was related to peat depth through a negative power function and increased linearly with above-ground tree biomass. Total ecosystem C increased from upland to peatland, with minimum and maximum values of 270 and 2100 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, and was largely dominated by soil C stocks, even at the upland end of the gradient. Although numerous small trees toward the peatland interior might allow a rapid increase in tree biomass C with lowering water tables, it seems likely that this would be a limited response, overshadowed in the long term by declines in the more substantial soil C stocks.

AB Methane fluxes were studied at two high-elevation oligotrophic peat bogs in the Ore Mts., Czech Republic. The Bukova dolina Bog was drained 15 years ago and 2 years ago was partly restored, whereas the Brumiste Bog is an intact peatland. Draining led to a change of vegetation structure, dominated by Molinia caerulea, Carex sp., and forestation by Norway spruce. Methane fluxes were measured monthly from April to November 2011 using a closed chamber. Temperature and presence of Carex were significant controls on methane fluxes. Peat depth, water table and the presence of other plant species had no significant effect on CH4 emissions. Methane emissions ranged from 9 to 2700 mg/m(2)/day at the degraded and from 3 to 260 mg/m(2)/day at the intact bog. In general, the degraded peat bog emitted three times more methane compared to the intact peat bog, likely due to vegetation changes after long-term artificial draining.

AB Mires (bogs and fens) are nutrient-limited peatland ecosystems, the vegetation of which is especially sensitive to nitrogen deposition and climate change. The role of mires in the global carbon cycle, and the delivery of different ecosystem services can be considerably altered by changes in the vegetation, which has a strong impact on peat-formation and hydrology. Mire ecosystems are commonly open with limited canopy cover but both nitrogen deposition and increased temperatures may increase the woody vegetation component. It has been predicted that such an increase in tree cover and the associated effects on light and water regimes would cause a positive feed-back loop with respect to the ground vegetation. None of these effects, however, have so far been confirmed in large-scale spatiotemporal studies. Here we analyzed data pertaining to mire vegetation from the Swedish National Forest Inventory collected from permanent sample plots over a period of 20 yr along a latitudinal gradient covering 14 degrees. We hypothesized that the changes would be larger in the southern parts as a result of higher nitrogen deposition and warmer climate. Our results showed an increase in woody vegetation with increases in most ericaceous dwarf-shrubs and in the basal area of trees. These changes were, in contrast to our expectations, evenly distributed over most of the latitudinal gradient. While nitrogen deposition is elevated in the south, the increase in temperatures during recent decades has been larger in the north. Hence, we suggest that different processes in the north and south have produced similar vegetation changes along the latitudinal gradient. There was, however, a sharp increase in compositional change at high deposition, indicating a threshold effect in the response. Instead of a positive feed-back loop caused by the tree layer, an increase in canopy cover reduced the changes in composition of the ground vegetation, whereas a decrease in canopy cover lead to larger changes. Increased natural disturbances of the tree layer due to, for example, pathogens or climate is a predicted outcome of climate change. Hence, these results may have important implications for predictions of long-term effects of increased temperature on peatland vegetation.

AB Blanket peatlands constitute a rare ecosystem on a global scale, but blanket peatland is the most important peatland type on the British Isles. Most long-term peatland development models have focussed on peat bogs and high-latitude regions. Here, we present a process-based 2-D hillslope model to simulate long-term blanket peatland development along complex hillslope topographies. To calibrate the model, the peatland architecture was assessed along 56 hillslope transects in the headwaters of the river Dee (633 km(2)) in eastern Scotland, resulting in a dataset of 866 soil profile descriptions. The application of the calibrated model using local pollen-based land cover and regional climate reconstructions (mean annual temperature and mean monthly precipitation) over the last 12 000 years shows that the Early Holocene peatland development was largely driven by a temperature increase. An increase in woodland cover only has a slight positive effect on the peat growth potential contradicting the hypothesis that blanket peatland developed as a response to deforestation. Both the hillslope measurements and the model simulations demonstrate that the blanket peatland cover in the study area is highly variable both in extent and peat thickness stressing the need for spatially distributed peatland modelling. At the landscape scale, blanket peatlands were an important atmospheric carbon sink during the period 9.5-6 kyr BP. However, during the last 6000 years, the blanket peatlands were in a state of dynamic equilibrium with minor changes in the carbon balance.

AB This article reviews the existing conceptual and simulation models for peatlands and develops a model framework for simulating peatland dynamics in boreal regions. Clymo's peat bog growth model has been used as the conceptual foundation in published simulation models, but in these models the structural and functional layers of litter, acrotelm and catotelm are not dynamically integrated. Organic-matter decomposition processes in these layers operate at different rates over various time scales. The processes in more active litter and acrotelm layers largely pre-determine the net peat accumulation in the catotelm. On the basis of evaluating litter and peat-core data, we propose a model design that connects different layers through changing water-table depth, driven by effective moisture. The model framework includes single and double negative exponential decay functions that together produce net peat accumulation or degradation and hence carbon balance. The model is designed to be generic in structure, but can be validated using estimated parameters and observed peat accumulation data for continental western Canada. The objectives of this model exercise are (1) to understand the interactions of different biological and environmental factors in boreal peatlands, and (2) to realistically simulate peat accumulation and decay over the last several millennia using proxy paleoclimate data as drivers and peat profiles for validation.

AB Large-scale changes in climate may have many unexpected effects on ecosystems, given the importance of climate as a control over almost all ecosystem attributes and their many internal feedbacks. In particular, the interactions among energy flux, plant dynamics, and soil carbon and nutrient cycling are poorly known. In this study, we examined biotic controls over soil temperature and evapotranspiration (ET) in a climate change experiment in two peatlands, a bog and a fen. Bogs are isolated from groundwater inputs (i.e., ombrogenous) and are acidic, whereas fens receive groundwater inputs (i.e., minerogenous) and are more alkaline. They also have many associated differences in soil chemistry, nutrient availability, and plant communities.
   We removed 27 intact peat monoliths each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Heating was achieved with overhead infrared lamps, so soil temperature was a dependent variable.
   Increased infrared loading caused mean monthly soil temperature to increase by 1.6 degrees-4.1 degrees C at 15 cm depth during the growing season (May-October). The soil temperature response was strongly seasonal, with much greater effects during the growing season than during the winter. Within the growing season, heating caused greater increases in soil temperature in May-June in the bog plots and in May-June and September-October in the fen plots. Occasionally during the winter, increased infrared loading cooled the soil by up to 5.1 degrees C, probably due to melting of the insulating snow cover. Fen plots were on average 0.8 degrees-1.0 degrees C warmer than bog plots during the growing season, although bog plots had a steeper soil temperature gradient with depth. Water level had no effect on soil temperature.
   Annual ET was 12-23% greater in the bog plots than in the fen plots, at least partially explaining the cooler soil temperatures in the bog plots due to latent heat of evaporation. Additionally, warmer, wetter conditions increased ET. In the fen plots, ET was more sensitive to water table depth than in the bog plots. Differences in the composition and seasonality of the plant canopies accounted for much of the observed differences in ET between bog and fen mesocosms, and hence soil temperature. We present a conceptual model of how above- and belowground ecosystem processes control energy fluxes in northern peatlands and suggest that such controls represent a general phenomenon that should be incorporated into climate change models that include biotic feedbacks.

AB On a global scale, over the past 200 years peatlands have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Drainage for agriculture, forestry and peat extraction have resulted in a 16-37 per cent loss in the carbon sink capacity. The current scenarios for climate change in Britain will exacerbate this loss. A shift in the carbon balance of peatlands is not necessarily the only outcome of climate change. Indirect hydrological changes-especially alteration of the position of the peat water table-will affect the stability of peatland ecosystems. This raises a number of questions concerning the future of British peatlands: the most important of which is how will the water balance change on a regional scale? In Britain the potential response of peatlands to climate change varies spatially. In upland areas, where rainfall is the main source of water, the key question is will erosion increase and if so, how fast? It will also be important to establish the drainage network response in terms of run-off, sediment loading and stream water quality. Increased precipitation may increase the rate of sedimentation in reservoirs thus affecting their water-holding capacity and water quality. Enhanced decomposition at elevated temperatures may also increase the microbial release of humic acids and increase the incidence of colour in upland waters which will in turn increase the cost of water quality treatment. In lowland Britain, the increased flood risk and more or less permanently elevated water table (as a result of both a rising sea level and sinking land surface) may enable peat regeneration through paludification. Key areas that are likely to be affected have spring or floodwater as their main source of water. They include the Norfolk Broads, Suffolk valley peats, Cambridgeshire Fens, Humberhead Levels, Derwent Ings and possibly the Somerset and Gwent Levels. In order to minimize the effects of climate change on peatlands and to preserve their existing carbon sink capacity (however small) they must remain hydrologically intact, and as high a water table as possible must be maintained. This may be possible in low-lying areas if flooding reinstates paludification but the process of peat regeneration is a slow one. In upland areas the effect of climate change is less clear; increased precipitation may encourage peat formation but it may also result in greater erosion.

AB Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was measured in four peatlands along plant community, hydrologic, and water chemistry gradients from bog to rich fen in a diverse peatland complex near Thompson, Manitoba, as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). A simple model for estimating growing season net ecosystem productivity (NEP) using continuous measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and peat temperature was constructed with weekly chamber measurements of NEE from May to October 1996. The model explained 79-83% of the variation in NEE across the four sites. Model estimation and parameter uncertainty calculations were performed using nonlinear regression analyses with a maximum likelihood objective function. The model underestimated maximum NEE and respiration during the midseason when the standard errors for each parameter were greatest. On a daily basis, uncertainty in the midday NEE simulation was higher than at night. Although the magnitude of both photosynthesis and respiration rates followed the trophic gradient bog less than poor fen less than intermediate fen less than rich fen, NEP did not follow the same pattern. NEP in the bog and rich fen was close to zero, while the poor and intermediate fens had higher NEP due to a greater imbalance between uptake and release of CO2. Although all sites had a positive growing season NEP, upper and lower 95% confidence limits showed that the bog and rich fen were either a source or sink of CO2 to the atmosphere, while the sedge-dominated poor and intermediate fens were accumulating approximately 20-100 g CO2 C m(-2) over the 5 month period in 1996. Peatland ecosystems may switch from a net sink to a source of carbon on short timescales with small changes in soil temperature or water table position. Since the difference between production and decomposition is small, it is important to understand and quantify the magnitude of uncertainty in these measurements in order to predict the effect of climatic change on peatland carbon exchange.

AB We initiated a multi-factor global change experiment to explore the effects of infrared heat loading (HT) and water table level (WL) treatment on soil temperature (T) in bog and fen peatland mesocosms. We found that the temperature varied highly by year, month, peatland type, soil depth, HT and WL manipulations. The highest effect of HT on the temperature at 25 cm depth was found in June for the bog mesocosms (3.34-4.27 degrees C) but in May for the fen mesocosms (2.32-4.33 degrees C) over the 2-year study period. The effects of WL in the bog mesocosms were only found between August and January, with the wet mesocosms warmer than the dry mesocosms by 0.48-2.03 degrees C over the 2-year study period. In contrast, wetter fen mesocosms were generally cooler by 0.16-3.87 degrees C. Seasonal changes of temperatures elevated by the HT also varied by depth and ecosystem type, with temperature differences at 5 cm and 10 cm depth showing smaller seasonal fluctuations than those at 25 cm and 40 cm in the bog mesocosms. However, increased HT did not always lead to warmer soil, especially in the fen mesocosms. Both HT and WL manipulations have also changed the length of the non-frozen season.

AB The depth of the groundwater table below the surface and its spatiotemporal variability are major controls on all major biogeophysical processes in northern peatlands, including ecohydrology, carbon balance, and greenhouse gas exchange. In these ecosystems, water table fluctuations are buffered by compression and expansion of peat. Controls on peat volume change and its spatial variability, however, remain elusive, hampering accurate assessment of climate change impact on functioning of peatlands. We therefore (1) analysed patterning of seasonal surface elevation change at high spatial resolution (0.5 m); (2) assessed its relationship with vegetation, geohydrology, and position within the peatland; and (3) quantified the consequences for peatland surface topography and ecohydrology. Changes in surface elevation were monitored using digital close-range photogrammetry along a transect in a northern peatland from after snowmelt up to midgrowing season (May-July). Surface elevation change was substantial and varied spatially from -0.062 to +0.012 m over the measurement period. Spatial patterns of peat volume change were correlated up to 40.8 m. Spatial variation of peat volume change was mainly controlled by changes in water table, and to a lesser extent to vegetation, with peat volume change magnitude increasing from lawn < hollow < flark. Our observations suggest that patchiness and vertical variability of peatland surface topography are a function of the groundwater table. In dry conditions, the variability of surface elevation increases and more localized groundwater flows may develop. Consequently, spatially variable peat volume change may enhance peatland water retention and thereby sustain carbon uptake during drought.

AB Permafrost in peatlands of subarctic Sweden is presently thawing at accelerated rates, which raises questions about the destiny of stored carbon and nutrients and impacts on adjacent freshwater ecosystems. In this study we use peat and lake sediment records from the Stordalen palsa mire in northern Sweden to address the late Holocene (5,000 cal BP-present) development of the mire as well as related changes in carbon and nutrient cycling. Formation, sediment accumulation and biogeochemistry of two studied lakes are suggested to be largely controlled by the development of the mire and its permafrost dynamics. Peat inception took place at ca. 4,700 cal BP as a result of terrestrialisation. Onset of organic sedimentation in the adjacent lakes occurred at ca. 3,400 and 2,650 cal BP in response to mire expansion and permafrost aggradation, respectively. Mire erosion, possibly due to permafrost decay, led to re-deposition of peat into one of the lakes after ca. 2,100 cal BP, and stimulated primary productivity in the other lake at ca. 1,900-1,800 cal BP. Carbonate precipitation appears to have been suppressed when acidic poor fen and bog (palsa) communities dominated the catchment mire, and permafrost-induced changes in hydrology may further have affected the inflow of alkaline water from the catchment. Elevated contents of biogenic silica and diatom pigments in lake sediments during periods of poor fen and bog expansion further indicate that terrestrial vegetation influenced the amount of nutrients entering the lake. Increased productivity in the lake likely caused bottom-water anoxia in the downstream lake and led to recycling of sediment phosphorous, bringing the lake into a state of self-sustained eutrophication during two centuries preceding the onset of twentieth century permafrost thaw. Our results give insight into nutrient and permafrost dynamics in a subarctic wetland and imply that continued permafrost decay and related vegetation changes towards minerotrophy may increase carbon and nutrient storage of mire deposits and reduce nutrient fluxes in runoff. Rapid permafrost degradation may on the other hand lead to widespread mire erosion and to relatively short periods of significantly increased nutrient loading in adjacent lakes.

AB Boreal peatlands contain approximately 500Pg carbon (C) in the soil, emit globally significant quantities of methane (CH4), and are highly sensitive to climate change. Warming associated with global climate change is likely to increase the rate of the temperature-sensitive processes that decompose stored organic carbon and release carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4. Variation in the temperature sensitivity of CO2 and CH4 production and increased peat aerobicity due to enhanced growing-season evapotranspiration may alter the nature of peatland trace gas emission. As CH4 is a powerful greenhouse gas with 34 times the warming potential of CO2, it is critical to understand how factors associated with global change will influence surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Here, we leverage the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) climate change manipulation experiment to understand the impact of a 0-9 degrees C gradient in deep belowground warming (Deep Peat Heat, DPH) on peat surface CO2 and CH4 fluxes. We find that DPH treatments increased both CO2 and CH4 emission. Methane production was more sensitive to warming than CO2 production, decreasing the C-CO2:C-CH4 of the respired carbon. Methane production is dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis but deep peat warming increased the C-13 of CH4 suggesting an increasing contribution of acetoclastic methanogenesis to total CH4 production with warming. Although the total quantity of C emitted from the SPRUCE Bog as CH4 is <2%, CH4 represents >50% of seasonal C emissions in the highest-warming treatments when adjusted for CO2 equivalents on a 100-year timescale. These results suggest that warming in boreal regions may increase CH4 emissions from peatlands and result in a positive feedback to ongoing warming.

AB Northern peatlands are among the most carbon-rich ecosystems on Earth, but many unanswered questions remain regarding linkages between their long-term developmental processes and climatic variability. In this paper, we present a detailed paleoecological reconstruction of the developmental history of a kettle peatland in northern Wisconsin, USA (Fallison Bog) based on 21 coring locations and temporally constrained by 69 radiocarbon dates. This record of within-basin developmental history is compared to a regional dataset containing estimated ages of peatland establishment for 75 core samples collected from 37 depressional peatlands throughout the Great Lakes Region. Finally, our data are used to develop a spatially explicit model of whole-system carbon accumulation in Fallison Bog, which distinguishes between carbon pools stored in limnic sediments and peat deposits. Results indicate that peatland development in Fallison Bog was episodic and spatially complex. Peatland development was related to the morphology of the underlying basin and characterized by pulses of both terrestrialization and paludification. Major episodes of terrestrialization centered on 4980 and 3180 years before A.D. 1850 (cal yr BP), with less extensive episodes occurring around 3840, 1060, 670, and 410 cal yr BP. Extensive peatland area developed by paludification of shallow portions of the basin around 2040 cal yr BP. The timing of peatland development within Fallison Bog was correlated with the timing of peatland development in other depressional peatlands across the Great Lakes Region (r = 0.70), suggesting a common climatic driver. Comparison of peatland development in Fallison Bog and independent paleoclimate records suggested that both millennial-scale and sub-centennial-scale variability in moisture balance influenced spatiotemporal patterns of peatland development. Model results indicated that Fallison Bog accumulated similar to 6655 t of carbon during the Holocene, with 66% of this total stored in peat deposits that have accumulated in only the last similar to 5000 years. Collectively, model results and the strong correlation between the timing of within-basin and regional pulses of peatland establishment imply that depressional peatlands likely experienced climate-sensitive and episodic changes in carbon accumulation rates during the Holocene, and similar dynamics could be expected in response to ongoing and future climatic change.

AB Northern boreal peatlands are major terrestrial sinks of organic carbon and these ecosystems, which are highly sensitive to human activities and climate change, act as sensitive archives of past environmental change at various timescales. This study aims at understanding how the climate changes of the last 1000 years have affected peatland vegetation dynamics in the boreal region of Alberta in western Canada. Peat cores were collected from five bogs in the Fort McMurray region (56-57 degrees N), at the southern limit of sporadic permafrost, and two in central Alberta (53 N and 55 N) outside the present-day limit of permafrost peatlands. The past changes in vegetation communities were reconstructed using detailed plant macrofossil analyses combined with high-resolution peat chronologies (C-14, atmospheric bomb pulse C-14, Pb-210 and cryptotephras). Peat humification proxies (C/N, HNC, bulk density) and records of pH and ash content were also used to improve the interpretation of climate-related vegetation changes. Our study shows important changes in peatland vegetation and physical and chemical peat properties during the Little Ice Age (LIA) cooling period mainly from around 1700 CE and the subsequent climate warming of the 20th century. In some bogs, the plant macrofossils have recorded periods of permafrost aggradation during the LIA with drier surface conditions, increased peat humification and high abundance of ericaceous shrubs and black spruce (Picea mariana). The subsequent permafrost thaw was characterized by a short-term shift towards wetter conditions (Sphagnum sect. Cuspidata) and a decline in Picea mariana. Finally, a shift to a dominance of Sphagnum sect. Acutifolia (mainly Sphagnum fuscum) occurred in all the bogs during the second half of the 20th century, indicating the establishment of dry ombrotrophic conditions under the recent warmer and drier climate conditions.

AB Question: How do we distinguish between concurrent allogenic and autogenic forcings behind changing patterns in plant community structures during mire development?
   Location: Lakkasuo raised bog, southern Finland.
   Methods: Two radiometrically dated peat profiles were studied using high resolution plant macrofossil analysis. A combination of partial direct and indirect gradient analyses (CCA and DCA) was applied to quantify the role of different drivers of vegetation changes.
   Results: Autogenic hydroseral succession explained 16% of the compositional variation in the vegetation. Disturbance successions initiated by fire explained 15% of the variation in the hummock, but only 9% in the wetter lawn. The early post-disturbance successional stages were characterized by Eriophorum vaginatum. After partialling out the effects of peat depth and time since fire, a moisture gradient explained 29% of variation in the hummock core and 26% in the lawn. The analyses also indicated alternation between species with a similar niche. This interaction gradient explained 26% and 31% of the compositional variation in the hummock and lawn, respectively. The similar order of species replacement from both cores supported the existence of general directional succession in mire vegetation, both during the mire development and after fire events. The autogenic succession was slow and gradual while the disturbance successions were episodic and fast.
   Conclusion: Our results support the paradigm of the complex nature of mire vegetation dynamics where several interlinked agents have simultaneous effects. The approach of combining partial ordinations developed here appeared to be a useful tool to assess the role of different environmental factors in controlling the vegetation succession.

AB The Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) of northern Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec, Canada is the second largest contiguous peatland complex in the world, currently containing more than half of Canada's soil carbon. Recent concerns about the ecohydrological impacts to these large northern peatlands resulting from climate change and resource extraction have catalyzed a resurgence in scientific research into this ecologically important region. However, the sheer size, heterogeneity and elaborate landscape arrangements of this ecosystem raise important questions concerning representative sampling of environmental media for chemical or physical characterization. To begin to quantify such variability, this study assessed the small-scale spatial (1 m) and short temporal (21 day) variability of surface pore-water biogeochemistry (pH, dissolved organic carbon, and major ions) in a Sphagnum spp.-dominated, ombrotrophic raised bog, and a Carex spp.-dominated intermediate fen in the HBL. In general, pore-water pH and concentrations of dissolved solutes were similar to previously reported literature values from this region. However, systematic sampling revealed consistent statistically significant differences in pore-water chemistries between the bog and fen peatland types, and large within-site spatiotemporal variability. We found that microtopography in the bog was associated with consistent differences in most biogeochemical variables. Temporal changes in dissolved solute chemistry, particularly base cations (Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+), were statistically significant in the intermediate fen, likely a result of a dynamic connection between surficial waters and mineral-rich deep groundwater. In both the bog and fen, concentrations of SO42- showed considerable spatial variability, and a significant decrease in concentrations over the study period. The observed variability in peatland pore-water biogeochemistry over such small spatial and temporal scales suggests that under-sampling in northern peatland environments could lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the abundance and distribution of natural elements and pollutants alike.

AB Peatlands store approximately 30% of global soil carbon, most in moss-dominated bogs. Future climatic changes, such as changes in precipitation patterns and warming, are expected to affect peat bog vegetation composition and thereby its long-term carbon sequestration capacity. Theoretical work suggests that an episode of rapid environmental change is more likely to trigger transitions to alternative ecosystem states than a gradual, but equally large, change in conditions. We used a dynamic vegetation model to explore the impacts of drought events and increased temperature on vegetation composition of temperate peat bogs. We analyzed the consequences of six patterns of summer drought events combined with five temperature scenarios to test whether an open peat bog dominated by moss (Sphagnum) could shift to a tree-dominated state. Unexpectedly, neither a gradual decrease in the amount of summer precipitation nor the occurrence of a number of extremely dry summers in a row could shift the moss-dominated peat bog permanently into a tree-dominated peat bog. The increase in tree biomass during drought events was unable to trigger positive feedbacks that keep the ecosystem in a tree-dominated state after a return to previous normal' rainfall conditions. In contrast, temperature increases from 1 degrees C onward already shifted peat bogs into tree-dominated ecosystems. In our simulations, drought events facilitated tree establishment, but temperature determined how much tree biomass could develop. Our results suggest that under current climatic conditions, peat bog vegetation is rather resilient to drought events, but very sensitive to temperature increases, indicating that future warming is likely to trigger persistent vegetation shifts.

AB Patagonian peatland ecosystems have received very little attention in the scientific literature despite their widespread distribution in the regional landscape and the anthropogenic pressure they experience from the peat extraction industry. The functioning of these southern peatlands is strikingly similar to that of northern peatlands, but they have developed under very different climate boundary conditions. Therefore, studying these ecosystems provides a unique opportunity to test ideas and hypotheses about the sensitivity of carbon-rich peat accumulating ecosystems to climate change, in addition to filling significant data and knowledge gaps. Here we provide a synthesis of detailed peat accumulation records for southern Patagonia using a combination of new peat-core analysis (from 4 sites) and a data review from previously published studies (from 19 sites). We also present the modern climate space (temperature, precipitation, and seasonality ranges) of Patagonian peatlands on the basis of modern peatland distribution and gridded climate data to discuss climate controls of Patagonian peatlands at the present and in the past by inference. Results indicated that Patagonian peatlands occupy a distinct climatological niche that corresponds to an end-member of the northern peatland climate domain, with a mild mean annual temperature (from 3 to 9 degrees C) and very weak temperature seasonality. We also found that Patagonian peatlands have been efficient land carbon sinks since their initiation, with a mean soil carbon density of 168 kg C m(-2) +/- 10%. The total carbon pool for these ecosystems was estimated at 7.6 GtC. Modeled peat addition rates to the catotelm in Patagonian peatlands were significantly higher than what has been reported for northern peatlands, but decay coefficients were similar between these two high-latitude regions. These results support the idea that long, mild growing seasons promote peat formation in southern Patagonia. At the regional scale however, the lack of correlation between climatic parameters and peat accumulation indices suggests that autogenic controlling factors might be at play. Overall, southern peatlands provide a unique opportunity for studying peatland-carbon-climate linkages under a new set of climatic conditions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peat represents a globally significant pool of sequestered carbon. However, peatland carbon stocks are highly threatened by anthropogenic climate change, including drought, which leads to a large release of carbon dioxide. Although the enzymatic mechanisms underlying drought-driven carbon release are well documented, the effect of drought on peatland microbial communities has been little studied. Here, we carried out a replicated and controlled drought manipulation using intact peat 'mesocosm cores' taken from bog and fen habitats, and used a combination of community fingerprinting and sequencing of marker genes to identify community changes associated with drought. Community composition varied with habitat and depth. Moreover, community differences between mesocosm cores were stronger than the effect of the drought treatment, emphasising the importance of replication in microbial marker gene studies. While the effect of drought on the overall composition of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities was weak, a subset of the microbial community did change in relative abundance, especially in the fen habitat at 5 cm depth. 'Drought-responsive' OTUs were disproportionately drawn from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Collectively, the data provide insights into the microbial community changes occurring alongside drought-driven carbon release from peatlands, and suggest a number of novel avenues for future research.

AB Climate change is considered to alter the functioning of boreal peatland ecosystems, but the vulnerability of pristine, rewetted and drained peatlands to climate change in temperate regions is unknown. We measured carbon (C) gas exchange during wet (2009) and dry (2010) growing periods in pristine, drained and rewetted sites in mountain bogs in the Bohemian Forest (Czech Republic). Wetter lawns with sedges and drier habitats dominated by ericaceous shrubs were distinguished and studied at each site.
   Methane (CH4) emissions, which decreased in the order pristine > rewetted > drained, were generally lower during the 2010 growing period than in 2009 as a consequence of a drought. During the drought in 2010, photosynthesis (P-G) in the drier habitats with shrub vegetation increased on pristine and rewetted sites, while total respiration (R-ECO) remained the same. Communities dominated by sedges maintained similar rates of P-G and R-ECO during both growing periods. Generally, this led to higher C accumulation during the drought on pristine and rewetted bogs. At the drained bog site, the decreased water table (WT) during the drought led to increased P-G and R-ECO, such that the net C accumulation was similar in the two years.
   Drained peatlands may be more threatened by future climate change than pristine or rewetted peatlands because of their limited buffering capacity for decreased WT. In the case of further decreases in WT, they could lose the peatland vegetation and functions that have partly persisted through decades of drainage.

AB Boreal peatlands are a major long-term reservoir of atmospheric carbon (C) and play an important role in the global C cycle. It is unclear how C accumulation in peatlands responds to changing temperatures and nutrients (specifically, nitrogen and sulfur). In this study, we assessed how the C input rate and C accumulation rate in decadal old peat layers respond to increased air temperatures (+3.6 degrees C) during the growing season and the annual additions of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) (30 and 20kgha(-1)yr(-1), respectively) over 12years of field treatments in a boreal mire. An empirical mass balance model was applied to Pb-210-dated peat cores to evaluate changes in C inputs, C mass loss, and net C accumulation rates in response to the treatments. We found that (i) none of the treatments generated a significant effect on peat mass loss decay rates, (ii) C input rates were positively affected by N additions and negatively affected by S additions, (iii) the C accumulation rate in the uppermost (10 to 12cm) peat was increased by N additions and decreased by S additions, and (iv) only air temperature significantly affected the main effects induced by N and S additions. Based on our findings, we argue that C accumulation rates in surface peat layers of nutrient-poor boreal mires can increase despite the predicted rise in air temperatures as long as N loads increase and acid atmospheric S remains low.

AB [ 1] Peatlands store the majority of soil carbon in many northern regions, yet their vulnerability to fire remains poorly understood. We used large-scale mapping of fire and peatland distributions to explore patterns of burning at two spatial scales. On a landscape scale in central Alberta, we used spatially explicit distributions of peatlands and 50 years of fire perimeter maps to determine whether uplands burn more preferentially than peatlands. Burn area and ignition localities in central Alberta did not occur preferentially in uplands relative to bogs and fens. Extrapolating this result at a regional scale, we used the Peatlands of Canada database and 20 years of historical fire records to estimate annual burn areas for Alberta, British Columbia, Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan peatlands. Peatland burn areas varied tremendously over time, with high fire activity in the early 1980s and mid-1990s. On average, fires impacted 1850 km 2 of peatland annually across this region of western Canada. Positive relationships between the area of peatland burned and weather variables calculated for each fire event using the Canadian Fire Weather Index, including maximum air temperatures and the duff moisture code, suggest that drier and/or warmer conditions likely would increase the burning of peatlands in western Canada.

AB Peatland ecosystems store about 500-600 Pg of organic carbon, largely accumulated since the last glaciation. Whether they continue to sequester carbon or release it as greenhouse gases, perhaps in large amounts, is important in Earth's temperature dynamics. Given both ages and depths of numerous dated sample peatlands, their rate of carbon sequestration can be estimated throughout the Holocene. Here we use average values for carbon content per unit volume, the geographical extent of peatlands, and ecological models of peatland establishment and growth, to reconstruct the time-trajectory of peatland carbon sequestration in North America and project it into the future. Peatlands there contain similar to 163 Pg of carbon. Ignoring effects of climate change and other major anthropogenic disturbances, the rate of carbon accumulation is projected to decline slowly over millennia as reduced net carbon accumulation in existing peatlands is largely balanced by new peatland establishment. Peatland; are one of few long-term terrestrial carbon sinks, probably important for global carbon regulation in future generations. This study contributes to a better understanding of these ecosystems that will assist their inclusion in earth-system models, and therefore their management to maintain carbon storage during climate change.

AB Peatlands are important carbon reserves in terrestrial ecosystems. The microtopography of a peatland area has a strong influence on its carbon balance, determining carbon fluxes at a range of spatial scales. These patterned surfaces are very sensitive to changing climatic conditions. There are open research questions concerning the stability, behaviour and transformation of these microstructures, and the implications of these changes for the long-term accumulation of organic matter in peatlands. A simple two-dimensional peat microtopographical model was developed, which accounts for the effects of microtopographical variations and a dynamic water table on competitive interactions between peat-forming plants. In a case study of a subarctic mire in northern Sweden, we examined the consequences of such interactions on peat accumulation patterns and the transformation of microtopographical structure. The simulations demonstrate plausible interactions between peatland growth, water table position and microtopography, consistent with many observational studies, including an observed peat age profile from the study area. Our model also suggests that peatlands could exhibit alternative compositional and structural dynamics depending on the initial topographical and climatic conditions, and plant characteristics. Our model approach represents a step towards improved representation of peatland vegetation dynamics and net carbon balance in Earth system models, allowing their potentially important implications for regional and global carbon balances and biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks to the atmosphere to be explored and quantified.

AB Detailed inventory of peatlands by aerial photography shows that peatlands with climatically sensitive localized islands of permafrost cover 17,505 km(2) within a broad band of occurrence in continental western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). Within this zone, 37.5% of the total area covered by bog, and 9.1% of total area covered by fen have localized permafrost Iandforms (frost mounds and/or internal lawns). Regional distribution of the presence/absence of localized permafrost peatlands relative to expansive pear plateaus (peatland completely underlain by permafrost) shows that a north to south landform gradient exists that is dominantly controlled by mean annual temperature. Percent cover of localized permafrost peatland in an area is best explained by the amount of total peatland cover that can support it. Localized permafrost is associated with collapse forms (internal lawns) throughout the range of its occurrence in western Canada. In some locations permafrost has completely melted, moving the current southern limit of permafrost north by 39 km on average, and by as much as 200 km.

AB Historic carbon accumulation rates in four bogs on a north to south transect from Sweden to Germany were calculated by using the bulk densities and carbon concentrations of 1-cm peat layers and a fine-resolution radiocarbon chronology. Carbon accumulation rates were compared to environmental data to explore the effects of climatic factors. Carbon accumulation rates in a period without clear human impact on the bog ecosystems (c. AD 1700-AD 1800) ranged from 25 g C/m(2)/yr in the most northern site to 50 g C/m(2)/yr in the southernmost site, which coincided with increasing annual temperatures from north to south. This suggests that temperature or growing season length is a major factor influencing carbon accumulation rates at different geographical sites. The temporal variations in carbon accumulation rates within the sites tentatively suggest that carbon accumulation rates may still increase with further warming in northern peat bogs, but decrease in southern peat bogs.

AB It is anticipated that a lowering of the water table and reduced soil moisture levels in peatlands may increase peat decomposition rates and consequently affect nutrient availability. However, it is not clear if patterns will be consistent across different peatland types or within peatlands given the natural range of ecohydrological conditions within these systems. We examined the effect of persistent drought on peatland nutrient dynamics by quantifying the effects of an experimentally lowered water table position (drained for a 10-year period) on peat KCl-extractable total inorganic nitrogen (ext-TIN), peat KCl-extractable nitrate (ext-NO3 (-)), and water-extractable ortho-phosphorus (ext-PO4 (3-)) concentrations and net phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification rates at natural (control) and drained microforms (hummocks, lawns) of a bog and poor fen near Qu,bec City, Canada. Drainage (water table drawdown) decreased net nitrification rates across the landscape and increased ext-NO3 (-) concentrations, but did not affect net N and P mineralization rates or ext-TIN and ext-PO4 (3-) concentrations. We suggest that the thick capillary fringe at the drained peatland likely maintained sufficient moisture above the water table to limit the effects of drainage on microbial activity, and a 20 cm lowering of the water table does not appear to have been sufficient to create a clear difference in nutrient dynamics in this peatland landscape. We found some evidence of differences in nutrient concentrations with microforms, where concentrations were greater in lawn than hummock microforms at control sites indicating some translocation of nutrients. In general, the same microtopographic differences were not observed at drained sites. The general spatial patterns in nutrient concentrations did not reflect net mineralization/immobilization rates measured at our control or drained peatlands. Rather, the spatial patterns in nutrient availability may be regulated by differences in vegetation (mainly Sphagnum moss) cover between control and drained sites and possibly differences in hydrologic connection between microforms. Our results suggest that microform distribution and composition within a peatland may be important for determining how peatland nutrient dynamics will respond to water table drawdown in northern peatlands, as some evidence of microtopographic differences in nutrient dynamics was found.

AB Peat soils consist of poorly decomposed plant detritus, preserved by low decay rates, and deep peat deposits are globally significant stores in the carbon cycle. High water tables and low soil temperatures are commonly held to be the primary reasons for low peat decay rates. However, recent studies suggest a thermodynamic limit to peat decay, whereby the slow turnover of peat soil pore water may lead to high concentrations of phenols and dissolved inorganic carbon. In sufficient concentrations, these chemicals may slow or even halt microbial respiration, providing a negative feedback to peat decay. We document the analysis of a simple, one-dimensional theoretical model of peatland pore water residence time distributions (RTDs). The model suggests that broader, thicker peatlands may be more resilient to rapid decay caused by climate change because of slow pore water turnover in deep layers. Even shallow peat deposits may also be resilient to rapid decay if rainfall rates are low. However, the model suggests that even thick peatlands may be vulnerable to rapid decay under prolonged high rainfall rates, which may act to flush pore water with fresh rainwater. We also used the model to illustrate a particular limitation of the diplotelmic (i.e., acrotelm and catotelm) model of peatland structure. Model peatlands of contrasting hydraulic structure exhibited identical water tables but contrasting RTDs. These scenarios would be treated identically by diplotelmic models, although the thermodynamic limit suggests contrasting decay regimes. We therefore conclude that the diplotelmic model be discarded in favor of model schemes that consider continuous variation in peat properties and processes.

AB Late Holocene mire development and surface wetness changes have been studied in a small mixed mire located in central Sweden. Today the mire is characterized by a mainly ombrotrophic centre dominated by Sphagnum mosses, with Carex content increasing towards the more minerotrophic mire margins. Two peat sequences extracted from the central ombrotrophic part were investigated for stratigraphy, humification, testate amoebae analysis, C/N ratio and delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes. Three main stages of mire development are identified, with the first stage, between c. 4200 and 2600 cal. yr BP, characterized by water-logged conditions, suggesting a minerotrophic fen stage. The second stage, between c. 2600 and 1000 cal. yr BP, is characterized by more ombrotrophic conditions and Sphagnum-dominated vegetation. The onset of the prominent change at c. 2600 cal. yr BP could have been initiated by climate change coincident with a change in solar activity. The last stage, between c. 1000 and 50 cal. yr BP, is dominated by more ombrotrophic conditions, suggesting increased precipitation. This study shows that the response of hydrological proxies in a mixed mire during its development towards more ombrotrophic conditions might result in conflicting results, a finding that needs to be considered in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from mires that change between ombrotrophic and minerotrophic settings.

AB Peatlands abandoned after being exploited for horticultural materials can be characterized by soil-water deficits that challenge the establishment of appropriate plant species, thus rewetting is an important step to restoring them to naturally functioning ecosystems. A bog section of Bic-Saint-Fabien peatland near Rimouski, QC was vacuum-harvested for peat production and abandoned in 2000. Harvesting activity left topographic elevation differences across the harvested area, creating wetness gradients. In general, the site interior had more available water than peripheral regions. Bic-Saint-Fabien was cut down to minerotrophic sedge peat; therefore it was restored as a fen. Research for this study lasted four years, 2008-2011. A water budget was created for every year of study to determine the importance of different hydrological parameters at Bic-Saint-Fabien.
   The main loss of water was through evapotranspiration and the principal input was precipitation. The main difference in the water budget between study years was that pre-rewetting was climatologically wetter than post-rewetting. Despite more available water before rewetting, before-after-control-impact design ANOVA indicated the water table was significantly higher at the cutover area after rewetting. In 2011 a wetness gradient remained evident within the cutover section of the peatland; however the mean seasonal water table was close (within 20 cm) to the peat surface at all measured wells. An interior section of Bic-Saint-Fabien remained saturated for nearly all of 2011 and had mean seasonal water table of +2.4 cm, and volumetric soil moisture content and soil water pressure, measured 5 cm below the surface, of 86% and +4 mbar, respectively, compared to 15.4 cm, 67% and 103 mbar, respectively, at a nearby (similar to 100 m) peripheral section. Systematic differences in wetness across the site suggest that a uniform prescription for vegetation re-establishment in the rewetted section may not be appropriate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB We numerically investigate a diffusion-reaction model of an ombrotrophic peatland implementing a Turing instability relying on nutrient accumulation. We propose a systematic and quantitative sorting of the vegetation patterns, based on the statistical analysis of the numbers and filling factor of clusters of both Sphagnum mosses and vascular plants. In particular, we define the transition from Sphagnum-percolating to vascular plant-percolating patterns as the nutrient availability is increased. Our pattern sorting allows us to characterize the peatland pattern stability under climate stress, including strong drought.

AB Hydrological disturbances can alter the structure and function of ecosystems by changing plant species composition over time. Peatlands in the northern hemisphere are particularly sensitive to global change drivers related to soil water availability, such as drought and drainage, because of important ecohydrological feedbacks between species composition and water table position. Here, we examined the plant community structure and environmental drivers of species distributions over two growing seasons along a bog margin gradient, pre- and post-disturbance by beaver activity. Pond drainage resulted in seasonal average water table depth 8-24 cm lower in the second season. Five plant communities corresponded to changes in water table depth and acidity: bog, poor fen, meadow, mudflat and pond. Plant cover increased in meadow and mudflat communities, decreased in the pond community and did not differ between years in bog and poor fen communities. Changes in species abundance between years showed signs of alternate successional pathways: one that favors Sphagnum moss and bog community expansion and another pathway that favors meadow and mudflat expansion. This study highlights the non-linear successional trajectory of plant communities with changes in water table depth, which has implications for land management goals that aim to conserve the ecological integrity of peatland ecosystems.

AB Global warming and the resultant increase in evapotranspiration might lead to lowered water tables in peatlands and an increase in fire frequency. The objective of this study was to investigate some of the potential effects of these changes on peat decomposition. Dry mass losses and emissions of CO2 and CH4 from peat samples taken from three depth layers (0-10, 10-20, and 30-40 cm) of a black spruce peatland were measured in the laboratory at 8-degrees, 16-degrees, and 24-degrees-C under two moisture treatments. Effects of deep peat fire on decomposition were also simulated by burning the upper layer (0-10 cm) of peat and adding the ash to peat samples from the 10-20 cm layer. CH4 release averaged < 1% of total carbon loss in flooded samples. Release of CO2 was 4-9 times greater from the 0-10 cm layer than from the 30-40 cm layer. After 120 d, the 30-40 cm layer had lost < 1% of its original dry mass in all treatments. Higher temperatures strongly promoted decomposition of samples exposed to drying cycles but had little effect on decomposition of continuously flooded samples. Ash addition had variable effects on CO2 emissions but may have promoted CH4 production.
   It is suggested that in certain situations, global warming may not cause appreciable increases in carbon loss from peat deposits. The results indicate that some deeper peats are resistant to decay even when exposed to warm, aerobic conditions. However, further experimental work is needed to predict the long-term response of peat deposits to changes in water levels in different peatland types.

AB Northern peatlands are forecast to experience changes in surface temperatures and precipitation patterns in the next century, with implications for their long-term water table position. Because peatlands are a large global C sink, it is important to investigate how multidecadal changes to hydrology will influence peat quality and C cycling. We examined peat substrate quality along a gradient of long-term water table alterations (reference, wet, and dry) across a peatland complex in northern Michigan with Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, aerobic and anaerobic incubations, and elemental analyses. Peat substrate quality was determined by the intrinsic differences between hummock and lawn peat, in addition to being affected by changes in hydrology. These factors altered decomposition processes and created differences in vegetation communities and structure across the long-term water table gradient. Our data suggest that peat from inundated sites is the most labile and that long-term drainage results in degraded peat quality. There may be interactive effects of climate change for increased trace gas production if wet sites drain, particularly if lawn microforms are dominant. Wet hummocky peatlands might be more resistant to increased trace gas production if the depth to water table changes with climate. These results indicate that peatlands impacted by long-term water table changes will experience shifts in substrate quality with concurrent changes in greenhouse gas emissions and highlight the need to incorporate microtopography in assessing the sensitivity of mineralization processes.

AB The ongoing warming in high-latitude regions may be causing rapid changes in the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Of particular concern is the fate of belowground soil organic carbon stored in peat-accumulating wetlands, as these large carbon pools are sensitive to temperature and moisture conditions. Despite their important role in the global carbon cycle, considerable uncertainty remains over the carbon balance of northern peatlands in a changing climate. Here we examine the response of vegetation and carbon dynamics in a wet boreal peatland to recent climate warming using empirical peat core data and a new modeling approach. We observed a widespread shift from herbaceous Carex fen peat to Sphagnum moss peat around 100 years ago that was accompanied by a sharp increase in carbon accumulation rate. The observed apparent carbon accumulation rates over the past 100 years (96.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) were almost 10 times greater than those over the past 4000 years (11.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Once differential decomposition history was considered using three modeling approaches, the expected long-term accumulation rate of recent peat was still 2-6 times greater than that of the past 4000 years. We propose that recent warming has led to Sphagnum establishment, which rapidly altered the peatland surface chemistry and hydrology, further promoting Sphagnum growth and enhancing the carbon sink capacity of this peatland. Longer and warmer growing seasons could also have stimulated plant growth. Our results imply that accelerated carbon accumulation under global warming in some wet peatlands might offset some of the carbon losses experienced from other peatland types.

AB Sphagnum peatlands in the oceanic-continental transition zone of Poland are currently influenced by climatic and anthropogenic factors that lead to peat desiccation and susceptibility to fire. Little is known about the response of Sphagnum peatland testate amoebae (TA) to the combined effects of drought and fire. To understand the relationships between hydrology and fire dynamics, we used high-resolution multi-proxy palaeoecological data to reconstruct 2000 years of mire history in northern Poland. We employed a new approach for Polish peatlands joint TA-based water table depth and charcoal-inferred fire activity reconstructions. In addition, the response of most abundant TA hydrological indicators to charcoal-inferred fire activity was assessed. The results show four hydrological stages of peatland development: moderately wet (from similar to 35 BC to 800 AD), wet (from similar to 800 to 1390 AD), dry (from similar to 1390 to 1700 AD) and with an instable water table (from similar to 1700 to 2012 AD). Fire activity has increased in the last millennium after constant human presence in the mire surroundings. Higher fire activity caused a rise in the water table, but later an abrupt drought appeared at the onset of the Little Ice Age. This dry phase is characterized by high ash contents and high charcoal-inferred fire activity. Fires preceded hydrological change and the response of TA to fire was indirect. Peatland drying and hydrological instability was connected with TA community changes from wet (dominance of Archerella flavum, Hyalosphenia papilio, Amphitrema wrightianum) to dry (dominance of Cryptodifflugia ovilormis, Euglypha rotunda); however, no clear fire indicator species was found. Anthropogenic activities can increase peat fires and cause substantial hydrology changes. Our data suggest that increased human fire activity was one of the main factors that influenced peatland hydrology, though the mire response through hydrological changes towards drier conditions was delayed in relation to the surrounding vegetation changes.

AB Vegetation succession, drainage, and climate change are causes of peatland habitat loss in the Western Balkans. Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the most ecologically important invertebrate taxa in terrestrial ecosystems. To explore whether, and to what extent, fen ant communities are specialized, we sampled an alkaline fen, adjacent habitats undergoing vegetation succession, and the surrounding beech forest in west-central Croatia. Here, we show how a fen and its surrounding habitats differ in ant community structure, and which of the environmental variables (soil temperature, moisture, and pH) have the strongest impact in shaping those communities. In the two growing seasons of sampling we recorded 16 ant species, none of which were peatland specialists. While species richness did not differ between the sites, species diversity was the highest at a succession site. Specific environmental conditions of the fen limit colony establishment and allow survival of a small subset of ant species from the surrounding habitats. Consequently, only two ant species (Myrmica rubra and Lasius platythorax) were abundant at the fen site. Their presence at other study sites indicates that the fen fauna is composed of generalist species. The fen and forest community composition differed from the successional sites, and it was most strongly affected by soil pH. The fauna of these habitat islands completely lacks peatland-specific ant species. Knowing more about communities of these disappearing habitats will help us predict future biodiversity losses in similar habitats threatened by vegetation succession.

AB Boreal peatlands contain a large portion of the Earth's terrestrial organic carbon and may be particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. Temperatures in boreal regions are predicted to increase during the twenty-first century which may accelerate changes in soil microbial processes and plant community dynamics. In particular, climate-driven changes in plant community composition might affect the pathways and rates of methanogenesis, the plant-mediated emission of methane, and the scavenging of methane by methanotrophic bacteria. Climate change may also affect methane cycling through changes in pore water chemistry. To date, these feedbacks have not been incorporated into the carbon cycling components of climate models. We investigated the effects of soil warming and water table manipulations on methane cycling in a field mesocosm experiment in northern Minnesota, USA. Large intact soil monoliths removed from a bog and fen received infrared warming treatments crossed with water table treatments for 6 years. In years 5 and 6, concentrations, fluxes, and isotopic compositions of methane were measured along with aboveground and belowground net primary productivity and pore water concentrations of acetate, sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon. Water table level was the dominant control over methane flux in the fen mesocosms, likely through its effect on methane oxidation rates. However, pore water chemistry and plant productivity were important secondary factors in explaining methane flux in the fen mesocosms, and these factors appeared to be the predominant controls over methane flux in the bog mesocosms. The water table and IR treatments had large effects on pore water chemistry and plant productivity, so the indirect effects of climate change appear to be just as important as the direct effects of changing temperature and water table level in controlling future methane fluxes from northern peatlands. Pore water sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and acetate had a relatively consistent negative relationship with methane emissions, pore water DOC had a positive relationship with methane emissions, and BNPP had mixed effects. The bog mesocosms had much higher methane emissions and pore water methane concentrations than the fen mesocosms, despite a much lower average water table level and peat that is a poor substrate for methanogenesis. We suggest that the relatively high methane fluxes in the bog mesocosms can be explained through their low concentrations of inhibitory pore water compounds, high concentrations of DOC, and high plant productivity. Stable isotopic data from pore water support acetate fermentation as the principal pathway of methanogenesis in bog mesocosms (mean delta(13) CH4 = -41.0%, mean delta D-CH4 = -190%). Fen mesocosms had lower pore water concentrations and emissions of methane than bog mesocosms, despite much higher methane production potentials in fen peat. The methane from the fen mesocosms was isotopically heavy (mean delta(CH4)-C-13 = -28.9%, mean delta D-CH4 = -140%), suggesting a strong oxidative sink. This is likely related to the dominance of graminoid vegetation and the associated oxygen transport into the rhizosphere. Our results illustrate the need for a more robust understanding of the multiple feedbacks between climate forcing and plant and microbial feedbacks in the response of northern peatlands to climate change.

AB Minerotrophic sedge fens are common in sub-arctic regions and are a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH,), yet they have received less attention than other peatlands, such as boreal ombrotrophic bogs, which are smaller sources of CH4. At the process level, CH4 fluxes in sub-arctic systems are limited primarily by cold temperatures, and thus are sensitive to potential climate change. This study examined CH, dynamics in a temperate sedge-fen to determine controls on the spatial and temporal variability in CH4 fluxes and, therefore, how the biogeochemistry of CH4 in sedge-fen peatlands may respond to predicted changes in climate. We used flux chambers and laboratory peat incubations over a six to seven-year period (1994-2000) to study fluxes, pools, and potential production of CH4 in a peat-forming wetland in central New York State, USA. Results showed that precipitation (i.e., dry years and depth to water table) exerted an important control on annual and seasonal patterns of CH4 fluxes. Mean summer flux rates ranged from 2258 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in the wettest year to -934 nmol m(-2) s(-1) (net consumption) in the driest year. CH4 concentrations in the surface peat were as low as 0.01 mu atm and as high as 10 matm in the summer months depending on precipitation patterns. In contrast, CH4 concentrations were consistently two to three times greater in sub-surface than in surface peat, and pools persisted during dry years and were temporally less variable. Fluxes were only weakly associated with potential CH4 production rates, which showed little seasonal variation. In-vitro measurements of potential CH4 production did not sufficiently explain fluxes, suggesting a need for improved in-situ methods for measuring CH4 production. Site differences associated with different dominant vegetation had a significant effect on CH4 cycling in all years except the driest, suggesting sensitivity to vegetation changes. These results indicate that predicting responses of fen peatlands to environmental requires an improved understanding of the underlying microbial processes and mechanisms that control CH4 cycling.

AB Lateral expansion of floating vegetation mats over the surface of aquatic ecosystems (terrestrialization) is one of the ways of peatland development. This process was commonly studied in kettle-hole lakes, whereas karst ponds have received less attention. We used a suite of palaeoecological analyses at Karstovoe mire (Mordovia, Russia) to reconstruct the formation of a floating Sphagnum-dominated peat mat over the karst pond. The results show that the floating peat mat had covered the central part of the pond by ca. AD 1600. Remains of Scirpus sp. and Calamagrostis sp. in the basal layers indicate that these plants might form a framework on which Sphagnum mosses and sedges were established. The terrestrialization could be triggered by the 'Medieval Warm Period' (AD 950-1250) as droughts reduce water levels and allow the pioneering plants to colonize exposed bottom sediments on the margins of lakes. Later, the development of the mire was mainly driven by autogenic factors that could be explained by the relatively stable hydrological regime in freely floating or poorly attached vegetation mats. In the mid 19th century, the surface wetness of the mire started to decline that can be related to both increased human activity associated with fires and to a greater thickness of the mat so that autogenic and allogenic effects were difficult to disentangle. In less than a century after that, the fen transformed to a pioneer raised mire. Our results show complex and context-dependent effect of autogenic and allogenic factors on the development of floating peat mats.

AB Background: Peatlands are an important component of Canada's landscape, however there is little information on their national-scale net emissions of carbon dioxide [Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE)] and methane (CH4). This study compiled results for peatland NEE and CH4 emissions from chamber and eddy covariance studies across Canada. The data were summarized by bog, poor fen and rich-intermediate fen categories for the seven major peatland containing terrestrial ecozones (Atlantic Maritime, Mixedwood Plains, Boreal Shield, Boreal Plains, Hudson Plains, Taiga Shield, Taiga Plains) that comprise > 96% of all peatlands nationally. Reports of multiple years of data from a single site were averaged and different microforms (e.g., hummock or hollow) within these peatland types were kept separate. A new peatlands map was created from forest composition and structure information that distinguishes bog from rich and poor fen. National Forest Inventory k-NN forest structure maps, bioclimatic variables (mean diurnal range and seasonality of temperatures) and ground surface slope were used to construct the new map. The Earth Observation for Sustainable Development map of wetlands was used to identify open peatlands with minor tree cover.
   Results: The new map was combined with averages of observed NEE and CH4 emissions to estimate a growing season integrated NEE (+/- SE) at - 108.8 (+/- 41.3) Mt CO2 season(-1) and CH4 emission at 4.1 (+/- 1.5) Mt CH4 season(-1) for the seven ecozones. Converting CH4 to CO2 equivalent (CO2 e; Global Warming Potential of 25 over 100 years) resulted in a total net sink of - 7.0 (+/- 77.6) Mt CO2 e season(-1) for Canada. Boreal Plains peatlands contributed most to the NEE sink due to high CO2 uptake rates and large peatland areas, while Boreal Shield peatlands contributed most to CH4 emissions due to moderate emission rates and large peatland areas. Assuming a winter CO2 emission of 0.9 g CO2 M-2 day(-1) creates an annual CO2 source (24.2 Mt CO2 year(-1) ) and assuming a winter CH4 emission of 7 mg CH4 M-2 day(-1) inflates the total net source to 151.8 Mt CO2 e year(-1).
   Conclusions: This analysis improves upon previous basic, aspatial estimates and discusses the potential sources of the high uncertainty in spatially integrated fluxes, indicating a need for continued monitoring and refined maps of peatland distribution for national carbon and greenhouse gas flux estimation.

AB Boreal peatlands in Canada comprise a substantial store of soil organic carbon (peat), and this peat is vulnerable to extensive burning during periods of extended drying. Increased frequency of extreme weather events in boreal regions is expected with future climate change, and the conditions that would support sustained smouldering peat combustion within peatlands may be more common. Organic soils tend to burn by smouldering combustion, a very slow-moving process in fuels such as those found in peatlands. Thus the most extreme conditions for carbon loss to the atmosphere due to the burning of peat likely occur when widespread propagation of flaming combustion leads to widespread initiation of smouldering. To investigate the potential for large-scale, high-intensity fire spread across forested bogs, we examined the fuel conditions in forested bogs necessary to support active crown fire. We measured surface and canopy fine fuels (those available to contribute to the propagating energy flux of the main flaming front) across a postfire chronosequence of forested boreal bog from central Alberta, Canada. We found that fuel load of fine surface material remained relatively constant across the chronosequence and at levels large enough to support crown fire initiation. Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) regeneration begins to fill in the crown space with increasing time since disturbance and achieves crown bulk densities similar to black spruce upland forests. We estimated that after about 80 years, the black spruce canopy has developed enough available fuel to support active crown fire on between 10% to 40% of days in a typical fire season in central Alberta, Canada. Broad-scale propagation of high-intensity fire across a peatland when coincident with drought-induced lower moisture in deep peatland layers has the potential to lead to a substantial release of stored terrestrial carbon.

AB Interpretation of proxy-climate records depends on a thorough understanding of the proxyclimate relationship. Peatland surface wetness records have been interpreted as reflecting changes between cool and/or wet conditions and warm and/or dry conditions. This paper analyses a high-resolution record of reconstructed water-table changes based on testate amoebae analysis in relation to instrumental weather records Since AD 1775. Replicate peat records are reconciled by multiple chronological techniques and tuning, and demonstrate that the reconstructions preserve many replicable high-frequency changes. Water-table variability is highly correlated with the total seasonal moisture deficit (precipitation evapotranspiration, P-E) expressed as the sum of all months with negative P-E. The reconstructed water-table record reflects antecedent periods of 5 or 10 years (maximum r(2) = 52.4%) and proxy bog surface wetness records can therefore be interpreted as reflecting the length and intensity of the summer water deficit period. Response surfaces of the summer deficit in relation to temperature and precipitation variability support the hypothesis that the summer deficit is determined by summer precipitation in mid-latitude oceanic peatlands and that summer temperature plays a greater but still subsidiary role in higher latitude, continental settings. These relationships apply for all plausible past Holocene climate changes and future twenty-first century climate scenarios. Non-linear responses to longer-term climate states prevent the direct application of a calibration of the reconstructed water-table records to infer quantitative estimates of climate variables. Models that combine peat accumulation, mire growth and hydrological processes are required to undertake this task.

AB Nutrient availability is an important control on the vegetation distribution, productivity and functioning of peatland ecosystems and we examined spatial and temporal patterns of nutrient availability through ion exchange at Mer Bleue bog, southeast Ontario, Canada. We installed ion exchange probes at 5-15 cm for 4 weeks and determined nutrient sorption at undisturbed sites as well as those affected by nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) fertilization and drainage. Under undisturbed conditions, the bog had very small amount of available nutrients, especially N(ammonium > nitrate) and P, and exhibited small variations in nutrient availability during the growing season (May to October). The increase in NPK availability upon fertilization was short-lived over the season and the stoichiometry of available NPK captured by the probes was mismatched with the vegetation. The increase in nutrient availability with drainage was confounded by substantial changes in vegetation. We compare these results with data from other Canadian bogs and fens to provide baseline data on nutrient availability in peatlands. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Discontinuous permafrost in peatlands has recently been melting across western Canada, creating wet Sphagnum-Carex lawns (internal lawns) interspersed within drier ombrotrophic bog. Permafrost degradation alters peat hydrology, thermal regimes and plant species assemblages, all of which could affect gaseous C emissions in peatlands. We quantified CO2 and CH4 fluxes across the peat-atmosphere boundary using dark static chambers in adjacent internal lawns, continental bogs and frost mounds in an area of localized permafrost in north-central Saskatchewan. Carbon dioxide and CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.2 to 14.6 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and from -24 to 344 mumol CH4, respectively, and differed significantly among peatland types and sampling dates. Our estimates of CH4 flux are low compared to previous estimates from boreal wetlands, with net consumption of CH4 typically in frost mounds. Permafrost melt in our study area is associated with 1.6- and 30-fold increases in CO2 and CH4 emissions, respectively. More widespread thaw across the discontinuous permafrost region will be an important consideration to boreal C budgets with future climatic changes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Climatic and environmental changes can lead to shifts in the dominant vegetation communities present in northern peatland ecosystems, including from Sphagnum-to vascular-dominated systems. Such shifts in vegetation result in changes to the chemical quality of carbon substrates for soil microbial decomposers, with leaves and roots deposited in the peat surface and subsurface that potentially decompose faster. This study characterized the bacterial and fungal communities present along a nutrient gradient ranging from rich to poor fen peatlands and assessed the metabolic potential of these communities to mineralize a variety of organic matter substrates of varying chemical complexity using substrate-induced respiration (SIR) assays. Distinct microbial communities existed between rich, intermediate and poor fens, but SIR in each of the three sites exhibited the same pattern of carbon mineralization, providing support for the concept of functional redundancy, at least under standardized in vitro conditions. Preferential mineralization of simple organic substrates in the rich fen and complex compounds in the poor fen was not observed. Similarly, no preference was given to "native" organic matter extracts derived from each fen, with microbial communities opting for the most bioavailable substrate. This study suggests that soil bacteria and fungi might be able to respond relatively rapidly to shifts in vegetation communities and subsequent changes in the quality of carbon substrate additions to peatlands associated with environmental and climatic change.

AB Blanket peatlands are rain-fed mires that cover the landscape almost regardless of topography. The geographical extent of this type of peatland is highly sensitive to climate. We applied a global process-based bioclimatic envelope model, PeatStash, to predict the distribution of British blanket peatlands. The model captures the present areal extent (Kappa = 0.77) and is highly sensitive to both temperature and precipitation changes. When the model is run using the UKCIP02 climate projections for the time periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100, the geographical distribution of blanket peatlands gradually retreats towards the north and the west. In the UKCIP02 high emissions scenario for 2071-2100, the blanket peatland bioclimatic space is similar to 84% smaller than contemporary conditions (1961-1990); only parts of the west of Scotland remain inside this space. Increasing summer temperature is the main driver of the projected changes in areal extent. Simulations using 7 climate model outputs resulted in generally similar patterns of declining aereal extent of the bioclimatic space, although differing in degree. The results presented in this study should be viewed as a first step towards understanding the trends likely to affect the blanket peatland distribution in Great Britain. The eventual fate of existing blanket peatlands left outside their bioclimatic space remains uncertain.

AB Northern peatlands are important shallow freshwater aquifers and globally significant terrestrial carbon stores. Peatlands are complex, ecohydrological systems, commonly conceptualized as consisting of two layers, the acrotelm (upper layer) and the catotelm (lower layer). This diplotelmic model, originally posited as a hypothesis, is yet to be tested in a comprehensive manner. Despite this, the diplotelmic model is highly prevalent in the peatland literature, suggesting a general acceptance of the concept. We examine the diplotelmic model with respect to what we believe are three important research criteria: complexity, generality and flexibility. The diplotelmic model assumes that all ecological, hydrological and biogeochemical processes and structures can be explained by a single discrete boundary-depth in relation to a drought water table. This assumption makes the diplotelmic scheme inherently inflexible, in turn hindering its representation of a range of ecohydrological phenomena. We explore various alternative conceptual approaches that might offer greater flexibility, including the representation of horizontal spatial heterogeneity and transfers. We propose that the concept of hot spots, prevalent in terrestrial biogeochemistry literature, might be extended to peatland ecohydrology, providing a more flexible conceptual framework. Hot spots are areas of a peatland which exhibit fast processing rates in a number of mechanistically linked hydrological, ecological and biogeochemical processes. The complementary concept of cold spots may also be useful in peatland ecohydrology, particularly with regards to understanding the vulnerability of peatlands to disturbance. The flexibility of our suggested scheme may allow the future incorporation of ecohydrological phenomena yet to be identified as important in peatlands. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Sphagnum is the major genus in northern peatlands that contributes to peat formation and carbon sequestration. Sphagnum growth in summer has been fairly well studied but the information about growth in autumn and winter is limited. Therefore, we studied how the growth of Sphagnum is seasonally distributed with a particular interest on possible winter growth. The linear increment and biomass production of three Sphagum species was measured in three Northern European bogs over a year. In all sites, our results indicate the highest annual linear increment in S. angustifolium (28 mm), followed by S. magellanicum (20 mm) and S. fuscum (13 mm), but the biomass production was fairly even among the species (189, 192 and 215 g m(-2), respectively). Both linear increment and biomass production depended mostly on meteorological parameters rather than ecophysiological or microsite properties. The seasonal measurements revealed a significant linear increment and biomass production during the winter that accounted for ca. 10% and ca. 5% from the annual values, respectively. Moreover, the mean daily rates of linear increment in autumn often exceeded the increment in summer. Our results thus indicate the ability for year-around growth of Sphagna if the conditions are favorable, including during boreal winter.

AB As natural sources of methane (CH4), peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Climate models predict that evapotranspiration will increase under a 2 x CO2 scenario due to increased temperatures leading to lowered water tables at many northern latitudes. Given that the position of the water table within a peatland can have a large effect on CH4 emissions, climate change may alter the CH4 emissions from peatlands in this area. Research was conducted during 2001-2003 on natural and drained (8 years prior) sites within a poor fen in central Quebec. Flux measurements were made for each site at different microtopographical features that varied in depth to water table and vegetation cover. The quantity of CH4 dissolved in the pore water was measured in the field and the potential of the peat for CH4 production and consumption was determined in the laboratory. Methane emissions and storage were lower in the drained fen. Growing season CH4 emissions at the drained site were 55% lower than the control site, primarily due to significantly reduced fluxes from topographic highs (up to 97% reduction), while the flux from topographically low areas remained high. The maintenance of high fluxes at these hollow sites was related to hydrological and ecological effects of the water table drawdown. The removal of standing water removed a potential zone of CH4 oxidation. It also enabled plant colonization at these locations, leading to an increase in gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). At the hollow sites, seasonal CH4 emissions were significantly correlated to seasonal GEP (R-2 = 0.85). These results suggest that the response of northern peatland CH4 dynamics to climate change depends on the antecedent moisture conditions of the site. Moreover, ecological succession can play an important role for determining future CH4 emissions, particularly from wetter sites.

AB Increased decomposition rates in boreal peatlands with global warming might increase the release of atmospheric greenhouse gases, thereby producing a positive feedback to global warming. How temperature influences microbial decomposers is unclear. We measured in vitro rates of decomposition of senesced sedge leaves and rhizomes (Carex aquatilis), from a fen, and peat moss (Sphagnum fuscum), from a bog, at 14 and 20degreesC by the three most frequently isolated fungi and bacteria from these materials. Decomposition rates of the bog litter decreased (5- to 17-fold) with elevated temperatures, and decomposition of the sedge litters was either enhanced (2- to 30-fold) or remained unaffected by elevated temperatures. The increased temperature regime always favoured fungal over bacterial decomposition rates (2- to 3-fold). Different physiological characteristics of these microbes suggest that fungi using polyphenolic polymers as a carbon source cause greater mass losses of these litters. Litter quality exerted a stronger influence on decomposition at elevated temperatures, as litter rich in nutrients decomposed more quickly than litter poorer in nutrients at higher temperatures (8.0%-25.7% for the sedge litters vs. 0.2% for the bryophyte litter). We conclude that not all peatlands may provide a positive feedback to global warming. Cautious extrapolation of our data to the ecosystem level suggests that decomposition rates in fens may increase and those in bogs may decrease under a global warming scenario.

AB Blanket bog is a highly distinctive biome restricted to disjunct hyperoceanic regions. It is characterized by a landscape covering of peat broken only by the steepest slopes(1). Plant and microbial life are adapted to anoxia, low pH and low nutrient availability. Plant productivity exceeds soil organic matter decomposition, so carbon is sequestered over time. Unique climatic requirements, including high year-round rainfall and low summer temperatures(2), make this biome amenable to bioclimatic modelling. However, projections of the fate of peatlands in general, and blanket bogs in particular, under climate change have been contradictory(3-7). Here we use a simple, well-founded global bioclimatic model(8), with climate-change projections from seven climate models, to indicate this biome's fate. We show marked shrinkage of its present bioclimatic space with only a few, restricted areas of persistence. Many blanket bog regions are thus at risk of progressive peat erosion and vegetation changes as a direct consequence of climate change. New areas suitable for blanket bog are also projected, but these are often disjunct from present areas and their location is inconsistently predicted by different climate models.

AB Apparent recent carbon and peat accumulation rates over the past 1200 years were measured in five peat landforms in the discontinuous permafrost zone near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, Canada. The White River volcanic ash layer was used as a chronostratigraphic horizon to ensure a consistent time span of peat deposition among peat cores and to allow a large core sample size (n = 20 cores in each landform) without the expense of radiocarbon dating. Apparent recent carbon accumulation rates were not significantly different (p>0.05) among rich fen (13.58 +/- 1.07 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), peat plateau (13.31 +/- 2.20 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and collapse fen (13.54 +/- 1.50 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Poor fen and ombrotrophic bog accumulation rates were 20.34 +/- 2.86 and 21.81 +/- 3.25 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, and were not significantly different from each other. Variation within the poor fen and ombrotrophic bog cores is attributed to microtopography, with hollows accumulating carbon at significantly greater rates than hummocks. Vertical peat accumulation rates vary significantly in the poor fen, with hummocks showing a greater annual vertical accumulation rate than hollows. Vertical peat accumulation rates ranged from 0.282 +/- 0.052 mm yr(-1) in the peat plateau to 0.563 +/- 0.070 mm yr(-1) in the ombrotrophic bog. Variations in mean core bulk density were also significant and ranged from 0.071 +/- 0.011 g cm(-3) (collapse fen) to 0.102 +/- 0.011 g cm(-3) (poor fen). A regional survey incorporating measurements from other parts of the southwestern Northwest Territories and the southeastern Yukon show rates similar to those near Fort Simpson. These rates are significantly lower than published rates from other parts of northern Canada, Finland, and the former Soviet Union. Low and variable summer precipitation in the region may contribute to the low carbon accumulation rates through decreased plant production and/or increased aerobic decomposition.

AB Increases in pool water and peat temperature in summer accelerate peat decomposition and production of biogenic gases, which can be trapped in peat pores and cause oscillation of peatland surfaces and the rise of peat from the bottom of bog pools. Associated changes in peat water conductivity, holding capacity and transpiration also affect bog hydrology. Our multi-year study is the first to show in detail the extent and dynamics of changes in bog pool depth and bottom topography associated with changes in temperature, peat type and other factors. The true seasonal rise of peat from the pool bottom begins once the water temperature at the pool bottom exceeds 13-14 degrees C, although the speed and extent of the rise depends on peat properties, making the rise more erratic than its subsequent descent. The more rapid descent occurs after the first large drop in the temperature of the pool's surface water at the end of summer, resulting from the combination of reduced methane production and increased gas solubility with less influence by peat properties. Much higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations (216 +/- 26mgl(-1)) in the pore water of peat risen from the bottom to the pool surface compared with that in the same type of peat at the pool bottom (62 +/- 20mgl(-1)) indicate an acceleration of peat decomposition at the warmer pool surface. We show the extent and character of changes in pool depth and bottom topography and how annual differences relate to temperature. Only a few degrees' increase in pool water temperature could induce the pool bottom to rise faster and more extensively for a longer period and enhance decomposition in the peat at the pool surface. This should be evaluated in greater detail to assess the effects of temperature increase on the carbon budget and hydrology of peatlands. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Climate change projections forecast an intensification of the precipitation regime for many regions of the globe, including central North America, with fewer, larger events interspersed between longer periods devoid of rain or snow. This shift has the potential to affect the carbon cycling of peatland ecosystems, including the flux of methane from the peat. We conducted a field manipulation experiment where irrigation treatments were used to simulate different seasonal rainfall regimes. The treatments were designed such that total seasonal rainfall was held constant but discrete event frequency and magnitude were altered between treatments in a poor fen in southern Ontario, Canada. The rainfall regime was controlled over three vegetation types: Sphagnum capillifolium (moss); Carex oligoperma (sedge); and Chamaedaphne calyculata (shrub). Decreasing rainfall frequency from thrice-weekly to bi-monthly [ coupled with 6X increase in event intensity] led to significantly greater CH4 flux from the moss and sedge communities in the latter third of the growing season. The shrub communities were unaffected by the changing rainfall regime. A companion lab mesocosm experiment revealed the control the fluctuating water table had on the CH4 fluxes from the vegetation community, particularly from the moss communities. Overall, there were significantly greater CH4 fluxes from all communities with increasing days since the previous rainfall event. As precipitation frequency decreases results of this study demonstrate the potential for increased CH4 flux to the atmosphere from peatland areas dominated by Sphagnum and herbaceous species. Wetland restoration and creation projects should consider these effects on peatland carbon cycling and function. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands form a large carbon (C) pool but their C sink is labile and susceptible to changes in climate and land-use. Some pristine peatlands are forested, and others have the potential: the amount of arboreal vegetation is likely to increase if soil water levels are lowered as a consequence of climate change. On those sites tree litter dynamics may be crucial for the C balance. We studied the decomposition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needle and root litter in boreal peatland sites representing gradients in drainage succession (succession following water level drawdown caused by forest drainage) and soil nutrient level during several years of varying weather conditions. Neither gradient had an unambiguous effect on litter mass loss. Mass loss over 2 years was faster in undrained versus drained sites for both needle litter, incubated in the moss layer, and fine root litter, incubated in 0-10 cm peat layer, suggesting moisture stress in the surface layers of the drained sites limited decomposition. Differences among the drained sites were not consistent. Among years, mass loss correlated positively with precipitation variables, and mostly negatively or not at all with temperature sum. We concluded that a long-term water level drawdown in peatlands does not necessarily enhance decay of fresh organic matter. Instead, the drained site may turn into a 'large hummock-system' where several factors, including litter quality, relative moisture deficiency, higher acidity, lower substrate temperature, and in deeper layers also oxygen deficiency, may interact to constrain organic matter decomposition. Further, the decomposition rates may not vary systematically among sites of different soil nutrient levels following water level drawdown. Our results emphasize the importance of annual weather variations on decomposition rates, and demonstrate that single-period incubation studies incorporate an indeterminable amount of temporal variation.

AB The ability to predict the effects of climate change on trace gas fluxes requires a knowledge of microbial temperature responses. However, the response of a microbial community to temperature in a given substrate may be complicated by its thermal history. To examine the effect of sequentially changing temperature on methane and carbon dioxide production in different peat types, we incubated anaerobic peat samples from 3 types of northern peatlands, a bog, a sedge fen and a cedar swamp, in both rising and falling temperature regimes. Graphic and statistical comparisons of the different temperature regimes suggest hysteresis in microbial response to temperature, although the absolute rates at any given temperature often did not differ. Where regressions for temperature response (Arrhenius plots) were significant, they generally differed between temperature regimes. The greatest differences among treatments occurred during the first half of the 40-d incubation. Increases in carbon dioxide production were similar across all peat types, but methanogenesis varied widely: methane production was uniformly low in the bog peat but increased sharply with temperature in the other two peat types. The complicating effect of history or chronology on substrate responses to environmental stimuli may restrain our ability to model the responses of complex systems to changing conditions.

AB The large belowground carbon stocks in northern peatland ecosystems are potentially susceptible to release because of the expected differential responses of photosynthesis and respiration to climate change. This study compared net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured using the eddy covariance technique at two peatland sites in northern Alberta, Canada, over three growing seasons (May-October). We observed distinct differences between the poor fen (Sphagnum moss dominated) and extreme-rich fen (Carex sedge dominated) sites for their responses of NEE to interannual variation in temperature and water table depth. The rates of growing season cumulative NEE at the poor fen were very similar among the three study years with an average (+/- standard deviation) of -110.1 +/- 0.5 g C m (2) period (1). By contrast, the growing season cumulative NEE at the extreme-rich fen varied substantially among years (-34.5, -153.5, and -41.8 g C m(-2) period(-1) in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively), and net uptake of CO2 was lower (on average) than at the poor fen. Consistent with the eddy covariance measurements, analysis of Pb-210-dated peat cores also showed higher recent net rates of carbon accumulation in the poor fen than in the rich fen. Warm spring temperatures and sufficient water availability during the growing season resulted in the highest-magnitude ecosystem photosynthesis and NEE at the extreme-rich fen in 2005. Cool spring temperatures limited photosynthesis at the extreme-rich fen in 2004, while reduced water availability (lower water table) in 2006 constrained photosynthetic capacity relative to 2005, despite the warmer spring and summer temperatures in 2006. The combination of contrasting plant functional types and different peat water table features at our two study sites meant that the poor fen showed a reduced response of ecosystem CO2 exchange to environmental variation compared to the extreme-rich fen.

AB Peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Many peatlands, such as those in the British Isles, Sweden, and Canada, have undergone increased erosion, resulting in degraded water quality and depleted soil carbon stocks. It is unclear how climate change may impact future peat erosion. Here we use a physically based erosion model (Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment-PEAT), driven by seven different global climate models (GCMs), to predict fluvial blanket peat erosion in the Northern Hemisphere under 21st-century climate change. After an initial decline, total hemispheric blanket peat erosion rates are found to increase during 2070-2099 (2080s) compared with the baseline period (1961-1990) for most of the GCMs. Regional erosion variability is high with changes to baseline ranging between -1.27 and +21.63 tha(-1) yr(-1) in the 2080s. These responses are driven by effects of temperature (generally more dominant) and precipitation change on weathering processes. Low-latitude and warm blanket peatlands are at most risk to fluvial erosion under 21st-century climate change.

AB Under predicted scenarios of global climate change, peatlands may become a net source of greenhouse gases which will accelerate warming of the atmosphere. Comparative studies of peat bogs along present climatic gradients may provide an insight into the future response of boreal and subarctic peatlands to changing temperature and moisture. Three maritime peat bogs in the British Isles, and two high-elevation peatlands in the Czech Republic were studied. All sites were relatively wet, the mean annual temperatures were higher by up to 6 degrees C at the British/Irish sites than at the Czech sites. Cumulative carbon content in Pb-210-dated Sphagnum-dominated vertical peat cores increased from the warmer to the colder sites when evaluated for the most recent decades (since ca. 1950). That would correspond to formation of thinner, more highly decomposed peat deposits over the long-term in warmer conditions, and deeper peat bogs in colder conditions. However, when cumulative carbon content was evaluated for the last ca. 150 years, no relationship was found between mean annual temperature and the carbon pool size. Even along broad present-day climatic gradients, site-specific factors controlled organic carbon preservation in peat. Pollen analysis was instrumental in corroborating the Pb-210 dates, identifying wet and dry periods in the past, and it also provided evidence for increasing nitrogen loads in wetland areas.

AB Over the millennia, peatlands have sequestered and stored carbon in the form of peat, that today accounts for around 30% of the global soil organic carbon. The peat has formed and accumulated due to the slow decomposition rate of organic matter in waterlogged, anaerobic conditions. The particularly close interdependence of the carbon and water cycles in peatland ecosystems signal the importance of understanding the water cycle to the functioning of peatlands.
   With this aim, the water and energy cycle of an alpine catchment in Italy, which includes a peatland, was studied using the process-based hydrological model GEOtop and a set of in situ measurements over 4 years (2012-2015). This is a challenging modelling exercise that has not been tried before with GEOtop. The catchment is heterogenous with land covers of peatland, grassland, scree and bare rock in a mountainous area. The GEOtop model was able to replicate the energy and water fluxes measured by an eddy covariance tower located in the peatland as well as the volumetric water content and soil temperature of the peatland accurately over the four years. This study shows that a process-based hydrological model can be used to study the water and energy dynamics of a peatland in a mountainous area.

AB We measured net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) (NEE) during wet and dry summers (2000 and 2001) across a range of plant communities at Mer Bleue, a large peatland near Ottawa, southern Ontario, Canada. Wetland types included ombrotrophic bog hummocks and hollows, mineral-poor fen, and beaver pond margins. NEE was significantly different among the sites in both years, but rates of gross photosynthesis did not vary spatially even though species composition at the sites was variable. Soil respiration rates were very different across sites and dominated interannual variability in summer NEE within sites. During the dry summer of 2001, net CO2 uptake was significantly smaller, and most locations switched from a net sink to a source of CO2 under a range of levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The wetter areas-poor fen and beaver pond margin-had the largest rates of CO2 uptake and smallest rates of respiratory loss during the dry summer. Communities dominated by ericaceous shrubs (bog sites) maintained similar rates of gross photosynthesis between years; by contrast, the sedge-dominated areas (fen sites) showed signs of early senescence under drought conditions. Water table position was the strongest control on respiration in the drier summer, whereas surface peat temperature explained most of the variability in the wetter summer. Q(10) temperature-respiration quotients averaged 1.6 to 2.2. The ratio between maximum photosynthesis and respiration ranged from 3.7:1 in the poor fen to 1.2:1 at some bog sites; it declined at all sites in the drier summer owing to greater respiration rates relative to photosynthesis in evergreen shrub sites and a change in both processes in sedge sites. Our ability to predict ecosystem responses to changing climate depends on a more complete understanding of the factors that control NEE across a range of peatland plant communities.

AB Forested boreal peatlands represent a precipitation-dependent ecosystem that is prone to wildfire disturbance. Solar radiation exchange in forested peatlands is modified by the growth of a heterogeneous, open-crown tree canopy, as well as by likely disturbance from wildfire. Radiation exchange at the peat surface is important in peatlands, as evaporation from the peat surface is the dominant pathway of water loss in peatlands of continental western North America. We examined shortwave and longwave radiation exchange in two forested ombrotrophic peatlands of central Alberta, Canada: one with (>75years since wildfire; unburned) and another without a living spruce canopy (1-4years since wildfire; burned) between the autumn of 2007 and 2010. Above-canopy winter albedo was nearly two times greater in the recently burned peatland than the unburned peatland. Incoming shortwave radiation at the peat surface was much higher at the burned peatland, which increases the amount of energy available for evaporation. This is especially true for hollow microforms that are generally shaded by the tree canopy in unburned peatlands. Snow-free albedo was similar between peatlands, although an increase in longwave losses at the burned site resulted in slightly greater net radiation at the unburned site.

AB Palaeoclimatic proxies from records in northwest Europe evidence a climatic deterioration, known as the '2.8 ka Event', which broadly coincided with the transition from Later Bronze Age to Iron Age in Ireland. This Bronze Age-Iron Age transition in Ireland has been invoked in various hypotheses concerning the relationship between environmental and cultural change. This paper offers a brief review of contrasting archaeological interpretations of the transition, outlines the gaps and uncertainties in current knowledge and highlights the role of climate change in some of these uncertainties. This is followed by a discussion of palaeoclimate records from peatlands, and in particular the utility of bog surface wetness records (BSW) to identify geographically and chronologically coherent periods of Holocene climate change, including the period around 750 BC (2.8 ka), which is apparent in both UK and Irish records. Whilst BSW records provide evidence of relative shifts from wet/cold to warm/dry conditions, quantitative indices of temperature and precipitation cannot be derived from these data. Recent work discounting a link between a demographic 'collapse' and climate change is considered, as is the importance of local-scale records for understanding the archaeology of peatlands. The role of 'bog burst' events (catastrophic hydrological failures of the physical integrity of peatland) in driving palaeohydrological changes in certain Irish peatlands is outlined. Whilst 'bog bursts' might confound the extraction of regional climatic meaning, they provide important contextual evidence for human activity and the associated archaeological record. Although there are some coherent patterns in palynological records, others demonstrate spatial and chronological differences in vegetation change and human impact across the Late Bronze Age to Iron Age, but the implications for changes in the distribution of human populations are unclear. The paper concludes with a consideration of the importance of robust chronologies for integrating archaeological, palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatological data to investigate potential links between climate and cultural change. The importance of different analytical, spatial and chronological scales to investigate the complex and recursive nature of the relationship between human activity and climatic change is discussed.

AB Climate change and gullies (and ditches) on peatlands are well known factors altering peat hydrology. Yet, exactly how this alteration emerges from interaction of these factors with groundwater dynamics is still not fully understood. In this study, we tackled this issue by coupling field measurement with model simulation using Visual MODFLOW. Groundwater processes and the associated water budget during five months of the wet season, 2017 were examined in the Zoige peatland, located on the northeastern side of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China with elevations of 3400-3900 m. Simulations were performed for a peatland area of 3.89 x 10(4) m(2) and three sub-zones within it representing peatland with no gullies (NG), a deep gully cutting through the peat layer (CT), and a shallow gully whose bed is within the peat layer (NCT). Model input parameters were calibrated and validated using the field-measured data. Modeling outcomes led to water budget showing relative contributions of main hydrological pathways (MHPs) (i.e., precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), gully, groundwater flow, and boundary) to changes of water storage in peats (AS). Although these MHPs varied differently during rain and inter-rain periods, AS values were mainly controlled by the oscillated trend of the difference between P and ET. Variations of MHPs caused by NCT and CT were secondary to those due to those of P and ET during the wet season referred to as the short-term climate change. Vertical groundwater (VGW) flows were strongly correlated with water table (WT) levels in both rain and inter-rain periods, but their directions had different patterns in the two periods. Horizontal groundwater (HGW) flows tended to move into the deep (CT) gully, while move from the shallow (NCT) gully to the neighbor peats during both periods. Since HGW flows were about ten times greater than VGW ones, their effect on AS was significant during the long dry season. This would lead to continuous loss of groundwater stored in peats, demonstrating the coupled effect of long-term climate change and gullies on AS. These findings underline the necessity of controlling gully development and avoiding ditch excavation in future Zoige peatland management practices.

AB Analyses of 50-year (1962-2011) monthly air temperature and precipitation data indicated substantial climate change in the locations of two raised bogs (Linnusaare and Mannikjarve) in central-east Estonia. During recent years the cross-year winter air temperature increased by 1.7 degrees C, while the cold-season precipitation increased by 4 mm. The fluctuation amplitude of temperature and precipitation values decreased. Snow depth proved to be the most sensitive variable to winter warming, followed by groundwater levels together with mean and maximum soil frosts. Long-term groundwater levels on the domes of the bogs and in the forested/treed lagg areas were 0.3-0.4 m and 0.4-0.8 m below the soil surface, respectively. Warming caused changes in groundwater level amplitude of 3-22 cm in the bog domes and 3-14 cm in the forested lagg zones. The lowest groundwater levels in ridge-pool ecotopes at Mannikjarve rose by 6-10 cm (i.e. these ecotopes became wetter); but the incidence of low groundwater levels increased in most ecotopes, indicating a more general trend towards drier conditions in the bog.

AB Biogeochemical processes in northern peatland ecosystems are influenced by seasonal temperature fluctuations that are changing with the climate. Methylmercury (MeHg), commonly produced in peatlands, affects downstream waters; therefore, it is important to understand how temperature transitions affect mercury (Hg) dynamics. We investigated how the freeze-thaw cycle influences belowground peat pore water total Hg (THg), MeHg, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Four large, intact peat columns were removed from an ombrotrophic peat bog and experimentally frozen and thawed. Pore water was sampled across seven depths in the peat columns during the freeze-thaw cycle and analyzed for THg, MeHg, and DOC concentrations. Freezing results showed increased concentrations of THg below the ice layers and limited change in MeHg concentrations. During thawing, THg concentrations significantly increased, whereas MeHg concentrations decreased. Limited bromide movement and depth decreases in THg and DOC concentrations were associated with increased bulk density and degree of humification in the peat. The experiment demonstrates the effects of the freeze-thaw cycle on Hg concentrations in northern peatlands. Changes to freeze-thaw cycles with climate change may exacerbate Hg cycling and transport processes in peatland environments.

AB In this study we provide a quantification of the main patterns of change of a subarctic peatland caused by permafrost decay monitored between 1957 and 2003. Up-thrusting of the peatland surface due to permafrost aggradation during the Little Ice Age resulted in the formation of an extensive peat plateau that gradually fragmented into residual palsas from the 19th century to the present. Only about 18% of the original surface occupied by permafrost was thawed in 1957, whereas only 13% was still surviving in 2003. Rapid permafrost melting over the last 50 years caused the concurrent formation of thermokarst ponds and fen-bog vegetation with rapid peat accumulation through natural successional processes of terrestrialization. The main climatic driver for accelerated permafrost thawing was snow precipitation which increased from 1957 to present while annual and seasonal temperatures remained relatively stable until about the mid-1990s when annual temperature rose well above the mean. Contrary to current expectations, the melting of permafrost caused by recent climate change does not transform the peatland to a carbon-source ecosystem as rapid terrestrialization exacerbates carbon-sink conditions and tends to balance the local carbon budget.

AB Permafrost peatlands store one-third of the total carbon (C) in the atmosphere and are increasingly vulnerable to thaw as high-latitude temperatures warm. Large uncertainties remain about C dynamics following permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands. We used a chronosequence approach to measure C stocks in forested permafrost plateaus (forest) and thawed permafrost bogs, ranging in thaw age from young (< 10 years) to old (> 100 years) from two interior Alaska chronosequences. Permafrost originally aggraded simultaneously with peat accumulation (syngenetic permafrost) at both sites. We found that upon thaw, C loss of the forest peat C is equivalent to similar to 30% of the initial forest C stock and is directly proportional to the prethaw C stocks. Our model results indicate that permafrost thaw turned these peatlands into net C sources to the atmosphere for a decade following thaw, after which post-thaw bog peat accumulation returned sites to net C sinks. It can take multiple centuries to millennia for a site to recover its prethaw C stocks; the amount of time needed for them to regain their prethaw C stocks is governed by the amount of C that accumulated prior to thaw. Consequently, these findings show that older peatlands will take longer to recover prethaw C stocks, whereas younger peatlands will exceed prethaw stocks in a matter of centuries. We conclude that the loss of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost by 2100 could result in a loss of up to 24 Pg of deep C from permafrost peatlands.

AB Peatlands are a dominant land feature in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), comprising > 50% of the total land area, many of which are moderate-rich fens. The carbon stocks of moderate-rich fens in the WBP are susceptible to degradation through anthropogenic- and climate-related factors, yet, few studies have aimed to understand their hydrologic function. This study, located in a meltwater channel belt characterized by relatively thin outwash sand and gravel (similar to 6 m) underlying the peat, provides the first hydrological assessment of a moderate-rich fen in the AOSR. The lithology, hydrological function and groundwater geochemistry all point to the dominance of a local flow system supplying groundwater to the fen areas, evidenced by a thick (similar to 16 m) and shallow (similar to 7 m below ground surface) aquitard underlying the outwash, restricting hydrological connectivity between the fen and underlying regional aquifers. Vertical hydraulic gradients between the peat and underlying outwash aquifer, and horizontal hydraulic gradients between the fen and upland varied in response to both short-term and seasonal precipitation trends. Groundwater discharge to the fen was enhanced during wet periods characterized by high rainfall. Conversely, flow reversals (groundwater recharge; fen to underlying aquifer and upland), and subsequently, enhanced fen water table drawdown persisted during extended dry periods. This local groundwater flow-system influences recharge/discharge patterns at Poplar Fen, with hydraulic head in the underlying outwash aquifer highly susceptible to fluctuations in the presence and absence of precipitation-driven recharge from adjacent uplands. Moderate-rich fens similar to that studied here will likely become more susceptible to drying in the future due to a changing climate, leading to enhanced water table drawdown, peat oxidation and subsequent decomposition, vulnerability to wildfire, and seral succession to a more ombrogenous peatland system.

AB Peatlands are essential ecosystems in global carbon cycle. However, they have been drained for economic benefits for centuries; large peatland areas have turned from carbon storage ecosystems to the carbon emitters. Because of the slow spontaneous revegetation of abandoned extracted peatlands, there is urgent need for their active restoration, required also for mitigation of global climate change effects. The selection ofSphagnumspecies suitable for restoration may also have crucial effects to reach the restoration aims. In 2012, we began a restoration experiment in abandoned extracted peatland in central Estonia. We aimed to elucidate whetherSphagnumspecies, specific to natural North European bogs, have different growth characteristics under altered growth conditions in restored extracted peatland. We studied growth characteristics ofS. fuscum,S. medium, andS. rubellumat restoration sites with two different water table levels and in two natural bogs. We estimated total cover ofSphagnumcarpet and cover of three target species and measured shoot growth characteristics at each site. Linear models with correlated errors were used for temporal trends studies. Our results showed that studiedSphagnumspecies have different growth characteristics in restoration sites and that the main growth promoter is the water table depth (WTD). Results showed that greaterSphagnumcover (over 70%) can be achieved in wetter conditions with WTD higher than circa 20 cm.

AB Extensive cushions of Distichia muscoides found at high elevations in the Andes form deep deposits of peat and function as peatland. The location of Distichia peatlands at the highest elevations makes them susceptible to the effects of global change including global warming. Accumulation rates of organic matter are the key function of peatland ecosystems and are highly susceptible to changes in climate. This study used Pb-210 chronologies to infer the recent dynamics of three Distichia muscoides peatlands located above 4000m in elevation. Chronological markers from dated volcanic eruptions were correlated to the Pb-210 chronologies of Distichia peat and validated the Pb-210 chronologies. Changes in Pb-210 activity with depth indicated rapid accumulation in recent times. Organic matter had a mean accumulation rate of 1400gm(-2)yr(-1) during the past 10years, with values well above the observed regional accumulation rate of 300-400gm(-2)yr(-1). The same pattern was observed in peat accretion rates, with growth rates of 1-2cm per year during the last 10years. Cushion plants engineer their own environment, allowing the system to be less susceptible to direct changes in climate. However, the high rates of peat accretion in recent times may be originated from increasing temperatures and excess water from nearby glacier melt. However, glaciers are predicted to disappear during the next 20years in the northern Andes, reducing water inputs in tropical high-elevation ecosystems.

AB The effect of climate change on peatlands is of great importance due to their large carbon stocks. In this study, we examined microbial biomass and effect of temperature and O-2 availability on soil respiration of surface and subsurface Sphagnum peat. The interactive effect of biotic and abiotic factors significantly affects soil respiration. Increasing temperature enhanced the microbial respiratory activity and thus the soil respiration, while there is a temperature threshold. The more decomposed subsurface peat showed a lower CO2 production due to less labile carbon and lower microbial biomass, but a higher temperature sensitivity. Q(10) of aerobic respiration increased from 1.93 +/- 0.26 in surface to 2.20 +/- 0.01 in subsurface peat. The linear relationship between Q(10) and depth in the uppermost 50 cm peat section can be used to improve the estimation of CO2 production in peat profiles.

AB Palaeoecological analyses of raised peat bog deposits in northwest Europe show the naturalness, antiquity and robust response of these ecosystems to environmental changes from c. 7800 years ago to the present. A review of the techniques used to identify these long-term features is presented and the role of climate change, autogenic change processes and human disturbance is discussed. Millennial records of vegetation changes recorded in peat deposits demonstrate the response (often rapid) of raised peat bog vegetation to climatic changes during the mid-Holocene, Bronze Age/Iron Age transition and the Little Ice Age. Greenhouse warming scenarios exceed the reconstructed Holocene record of climatic changes (c. the last 11, 500 years), and bog-water tables may fall considerably. A combination of centennial palaeoecological analyses of bogs affected by human disturbance and experimental manipulations have been used as analogues for the potential response of raised peat bog vegetation to these changes. These show that possible greenhouse gas climate forcing scenarios may exceed the ability of Sphagnum- dominated raised peat bogs to respond to projected increases in summer temperature and decreases in summer precipitation. In combination with increasing N deposition, a loss of their Sphagnum-rich vegetation and increases in the abundance of vascular plants could occur on decadal timescales.

AB In the boreal forest of continental western Canada, permafrost is restricted to Sphagnum-dominated peatlands on which air photo interpretation reveals the occurrence of five types of surface physiography. Concentrated in the northern part of the boreal forest, permafrost is present in peat plateaus with and without collapse scars. In the southern part of the boreal forest, continental bogs dominate, representing ombrotrophic peatlands that have never contained permafrost. In the mid-boreal zone, internal lawns are present in bogs and in fens. These internal lawns do not presently contain permafrost but did in the recent past, representing degradation of permafrost since the Little Ice Age. Evaluation of the distribution of these peat landforms indicates that today 30% of bogs contain permafrost at the -0.4 degrees C isotherm and 50% of bogs contain permafrost at the -1.2 degrees C isotherm, whereas in the past, 30% of bogs contained permafrost at the -1.4 degrees C isotherm and 50% of bogs contained permafrost at the -2.3 degrees C isotherm. Although spatial degradation has occurred with a shifting of permafrost northwards in response to warming since the Little Ice Age, permafrost cover has increased in any given area where present-day temperatures are between 0.5 and -3.5 degrees C.

AB Quantitative reconstruction of changes in mire surface wetness has been used to reconstruct proxy climate from an upland ombrotrophic blanket mire on the North York Moors in northeast England (May Moss). Testate amoebae, plant macrofossil and humification analyses were carried out for six peat profiles. Transfer functions are used to generate estimates of water table levels from the testate amoebae stratigraphy, which complement the semi-quantitative indications of changing surface wetness provided by plant macrofossil and humification analysis. C-14 dates provide the chronology for the stratigraphy. Differences were encountered between AMS C-14 dates on pure Sphagnum remains and radiometric dates on bulk peat from the same horizon, which perhaps arise from the heterogeneity of peat. Replicate palaeoecological analysis of adjacent cores identifies consistency within testate amoebae and plant macrofossil stratigraphies, and reveals a strong agreement between the water table level proxies. The record of hydrological changes at sites across May Moss are in synchrony, and so climate change is the most likely cause of the moisture fluctuations. Changes to a wetter or cooler climate were identified cal. AD 260-540, ca. AD 550-650, cal. AD 670-980, ca. AD 1350-7450, cal. AD 1400-1620 and ca. AD 1700-1800. Periods with a drier or warmer climate precede all of these wet shifts, with particularly dry periods between cal. AD 650-860 and 690-980 and between cal. AD 1290-1410 and 1400-1620.

AB Understanding of the surface energy balance is important for predicting climate change effects on carbon cycling in peatlands. Modelling of surface energy fluxes is complicated in these environments because of microscale surface topography, non-vascular moss dynamics, and sparse overstory vegetation; thus traditional 'big leaf' approaches do not simulate peatland environments well. Here we adapted a three-source (leaf, hummock, hollow) energy balance model and applied it to energy flux and temperature data from the Mer Bleue bog peatland. Model results show that latent heat flux partitioning into components from the three sources was strongly tied to available energy, The model output suggests that the vascular plants contributed 60-80% of the latent beat flux, hummocks 10-30%, and hollows 10%. These component contributions to latent heat flux showed little variation throughout the study period. It appears that this behaviour resulted from offsetting controls imposed by the vascular plant physiology and moss and peat porosity and capillarity characteristics. Although there was no evidence of strong microadvection between the vascular shrubs and hummock and hollow microtopography, this study highlights the importance of moss in the overall peatland energy fluxes.

AB Boreal peatland ecosystems occupy about 3.5 million km(2) of the earth's land surface and store between 250 and 455 Pg of carbon (C) as peat. While northern hemisphere boreal peatlands have functioned as net sinks for atmospheric C since the most recent deglaciation, natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and most importantly wildfire, may compromise peatland C sinks. To examine the effects of fire on local and regional C sink strength, we focused on a 12 000 km(2) region near Wabasca, AB, Canada, where ombrotrophic Sphagnum-dominated bogs cover 2280 km(2) that burn with a fire return interval of 123 +/- 26 years. We characterized annual C accumulation along a chronosequence of 10 bog sites, spanning 1-102 years-since-fire (in 2002). Immediately after fire, bogs represent a net C source of 8.9 +/- 8.4 mol m(-2) yr(-1). At about 13 years after fire, bogs switch from net C sources to net C sinks, mainly because of recovery of the moss and shrub layers. Subsequently, black spruce biomass accumulation contributes to the net C sink, with fine root biomass accumulation peaking at 34 years after fire and aboveground biomass and coarse root accumulation peaking at 74 years after fire. The overall C sink strength peaks at 18.4 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) at 75 years after fire. As the tree biomass accumulation rate declines, the net C sink decreases to about 10 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) at 100 years-since-fire. We estimate that across the Wabasca study region, bogs currently represent a C sink of 14.7 +/- 5.1 Gmol yr(-1). A decrease in the fire return interval to 61 years with no change in air temperature would convert the region's bogs to a net C source. An increase in nonwinter air temperature of 2 degrees C would decrease the regional C sink to 6.8 +/- 2.3 Gmol yr(-1). Under scenarios of predicted climate change, the current C sink status of Alberta bogs is likely to diminish to the point where these peatlands become net sources of atmospheric CO2-C.

AB In a context of climate change peatlands may switch from a sink to a source of carbon (C). The induced positive feedbacks are closely linked to C dynamics, and thus to the fate of organic matter (OM) in the underlying peat. Our aims were to determine how moisture conditions in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland affect the dynamics of diagenetic sensitive OM which is thought to be the most reactive to warming effects. The approach was based on the identification of combined bulk and molecular bioindicators of OM sources and decay of peat profiles (up to 50 cm in depth) from two moisture conditions of the Le Forbonnet peatland (Jura Mountains, France). The (xylose + arabinose)/(galactose + rhamnose + mannose) ratio derived from the analysis of neutral monosaccharides was used to obtain indications on the botanical origin of the peat and tended to indicate a greater contribution of Cyperaceae in the deepest parts of the peat. Most bioindicators showed that OM decay increased with depth and was higher in the driest conditions. In these conditions, decay was shown by a loss of diagenetic sensitive oxygen-rich OM, probably leached by water table fluctuations. Decay intensity was also shown by the high ribose and lyxose contents at the peat surface, where microscopic observations also revealed relatively large quantities of fungal hyphae. The sugars could have arisen from microbial synthesis, primarily protozoan and fungal activity. These results suggest that water level changes preferentially impact biochemical changes in diagenetic sensitive OM, believed to be sensitive to drought events.

AB Peatlands occupy approximately 15% of boreal and sub-arctic regions, contain approximately one third of the world's soil carbon pool, and supply most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) entering boreal lakes and rivers and the Arctic Ocean. The high latitudes occupied by these peatlands are expected to see the greatest amount of climatic warming in the next several decades. In addition to increasing temperatures, climatic change could also affect the position of the water-table level and discharge from these peatlands. Changes in temperature, water tables, and discharge could affect delivery of DOC to downstream ecosystems where it exerts significant control over productivity, biogeochemical cycles, and attenuation of visible and UV radiation. We experimentally warmed and controlled water tables while measuring discharge in a factorial experiment in large mesocosms containing peat monoliths and intact plant communities from a bog and fen to determine the effects of climate change on DOC budgets. We show that the DOC budget is controlled largely by changes in discharge rather than by any effect of warming or position of the water-table level on DOC concentrations. Furthermore, we identify a critical discharge rate in bogs and fens for which the DOC budget switches from net export to net retention. We also demonstrate an exponential increase in trace gas CO2-C and CH4-C emissions coincident with increased retention of dissolved organic carbon from boreal peatlands.

AB A high-resolution peat humification record is obtained from Hani peatland, northeastern China to study climate change. An absorbance value time series from alkali-extraction is used as a peat humification indicator. In addition, Hani peat magnetic susceptibility and trace elements have also been investigated. There is a sensitive response to abrupt climate changes when comparing a high-resolution peat humification record with a Hani delta O-18 temperature proxy record and a drift ice record from the North Atlantic Ocean. Based on analyses of factors that affect peat decomposition, we suggest similar paleoclimate significance between the Hani and Dajiuhu peat on the degree of humification with a higher peat humification indicating colder and drier climate conditions. In contrast, a warm and moist climate provides a deoxidized condition that results in lower peat humification. Moreover, the Rb/Sr ratios and chi(lf) in Hani peatland also indicate different climate conditions, especially in late Holocene. According to the Hani peat data, regional paleoclimate variations can be divided into the following five phases: 11.5-10.0 cal. kyr BP with warm climate conditions; 10.0-8.8 cal. kyr BP with sharply cooling and warming climate conditions; 8.8-4.8 cal. kyr BP with alternating cooling and warming climate conditions; 4.8-1.6 cal. kyr BP with warm climate conditions overall and 1.6-0 cal. kyr BP with cold climate conditions.

AB The majority of northern peatlands were initiated during the Holocene. Owing to their mass imbalance, they have sequestered huge amounts of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. Although recent syntheses have filled some knowledge gaps, the extent and remoteness of many peatlands pose challenges to developing reliable regional carbon accumulation estimates from observations. In this work, we employed an individual- and patch-based dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) with peatland and permafrost functionality to quantify long-term carbon accumulation rates in northern peatlands and to assess the effects of historical and projected future climate change on peatland carbon balance. We combined published datasets of peat basal age to form an up-to-date peat inception surface for the pan-Arctic region which we then used to constrain the model. We divided our analysis into two parts, with a focus both on the carbon accumulation changes detected within the observed peatland boundary and at pan-Arctic scale under two contrasting warming scenarios (representative concentration pathway-RCP8.5 and RCP2.6). We found that peatlands continue to act as carbon sinks under both warming scenarios, but their sink capacity will be substantially reduced under the high-warming (RCP8.5) scenario after 2050. Areas where peat production was initially hampered by permafrost and low productivity were found to accumulate more carbon because of the initial warming and moisture-rich environment due to permafrost thaw, higher precipitation and elevated CO2 levels. On the other hand, we project that areas which will experience reduced precipitation rates and those without permafrost will lose more carbon in the near future, particularly peatlands located in the European region and between 45 and 55 degrees N latitude. Overall, we found that rapid global warming could reduce the carbon sink capacity of the northern peatlands in the coming decades.

AB Fens belong to the most threatened ecosystems in Europe. Maintaining a high water table through rewetting is an effective measure to rehabilitate many of their ecosystem functions. However, the impact of meteorological conditions such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and precipitation on water tables is still unclear for rewetted fens. Here, we compare the impact of meteorological factors on water table dynamics in a drained and a rewetted fen, using multiple regression with data from continuous high-resolution (temporal) water level monitoring and weather stations. We find that an increase in the daily mean VPD causes a higher drop in the water table at the drained and degraded fen compared to the rewetted fen. Precipitation contributes to recharge, causing the water table to rise higher at the drained site than at the rewetted site. We attribute the differential influence of meteorological conditions on water table dynamics to different soil specific yield values (i.e., water storage capacity) largely driven by lower water table position at the drained site. Our study underlines the importance of understanding how and why water tables in peatlands vary in response to meteorological factors for management decisions (e.g., rewetting). Continuous monitoring of water table and vegetation development in rewetted fen peatlands is advisable to ensure long-term success especially under climate change conditions and associated drought events.

AB Rewetting of drained industrial peatlands may reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promote recolonisation by peat forming plant species. We investigated carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics over a three-year period in a rewetted industrial peatland in Ireland. Sample plots were established in bare peat, Juncus effusus-Sphagnum cuspidatum, Sphagnum cuspidatum and Eriophorum angustifolium dominated microsites. The relationships between fluxes and environmental variables were examined and regression models were used to provide an estimate of the annual GHG balance for each microsite. All the vegetated microsites were carbon sinks for the duration of the study. Highest uptake occurred in the Eriophorum microsite (146-583 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by Juncus-Sphagnum (35-204 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and Sphagnum (5-140 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The bare peat microsite was a source of 37-82 g C m(-2) yr(-1). No N2O fluxes were detected. Strong inter-annual variation was observed in all microsites, driven by variation in precipitation and subsequent changes in the position of the water table. In terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP), the microsites had either a cooling effect (Eriophorum), a close to neutral effect (Juncus-Sphagnum, Sphagnum) or a warming effect (bare peat) on the climate.

AB Northern peatlands store similar to 30% of the global soil carbon, despite covering only 3% of the land. To understand the carbon balance of these systems and predict their response to changes in climate, robust and reliable models are needed. The McGill Wetland Model (MWM), originally developed to simulate the carbon dynamics of ombrotrophic bogs, was modified to simulate the CO2 biogeochemistry of sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatlands, a prominent peatland type in boreal and subarctic landscapes. Three modifications were implemented: (1) a function to describe the impact of soil moisture on the optimal gross primary production, (2) a scheme to partition the peat profile into oxic and anoxic compartments based on the effective root depth as a function of daily sedge net primary production, and (3) a function to describe the fen moss water dynamics. The modified MWM was evaluated using eddy-covariance net ecosystem production (NEP) from Degero Stormyr in northern Sweden. The root mean square error for daily NEP was similar to 0.46g C m(-2) d(-1), and the index of agreement was 84%. This model adequately captures the magnitude and direction of the CO2 fluxes and simulates the seasonal and inter-annual variability reasonably well (r(2)>0.8). Sensitivity analysis confirms that specifically water table depth (WTD) and moss water content are key biogeochemical hydrology processes for the carbon biogeochemistry of a sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatland. An increase of WTD by 15cm or air temperature by 3 degrees C could decrease NEP by up to 200% and make the peatland become a source of CO2.

AB Changes in hydrological conditions are expected and may alter carbon cycling in peatlands. Peat aeration with water table change has not commonly been investigated, and the water table is often assumed to constitute the oxic-anoxic boundary in peat. We analyzed temperature, moisture, oxygen (O-2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in profiles of a temperate fen during two seasons. A drying-rewetting cycle and flooding were induced and compared to controls. The response of moisture and water table position varied greatly and was related to gradients of peat compaction and ash content. Background drought raised air-filled porosity (AFP) to a maximum of 15%-38% in shallow peat and experimental drought up to 50%. Decline in water table and soil moisture broadly led to O-2 penetration and CO2 degassing, and rewetting and flooding led to anoxic conditions and CO2 accumulation in peat pore water. In dense peat with >= 20% ash content the unsaturated zone remained partly low in oxygen, however, and up to 5% AFP and 20 cm above water table O-2 concentrations frequently remained below 50 mu mol L-1. Moderately intense and short drying did not induce substantial oxygen penetration in the compacted soil profiles. The likelihood of the presence of oxygen in the peat was predicted by logistic regression using water table and ash content or bulk density as predictors (p < 0.0005). The model is potentially useful for predicting the position of the redoxcline in peat deposits and may assist in improving statistical models of trace gas emission from peatlands.

AB Peatlands contain approximately 25% of the total soil organic carbon, despite covering only 3% of earth's land surface. The ecological, hydrological and biogeochemical functions of peatlands are tightly coupled to climate. Therefore, both direct human impacts and indirect effects of climate change can threaten the ecological function of peatlands through changes in hydrology. However, little is known about how peatland ecosystems, and specifically their biogeochemistry, carbon cycling, and development, may respond to climatic change. In this study, the Peat Accumulation Model was adapted to investigate the response of peatland development and carbon cycling to climatic change through simulating changes in precipitation and temperature at different stages of peatland development history. The warming and wetting were imposed on this system at 10,000 years since its initialization (mid-development stage) and at 20,000 years since its initialization (late-development stage). Here, it was revealed that peatlands can switch between carbon sinks and sources suddenly, but the extent to which the change takes place depends on the developmental stage of peatland ecosystems. The simulation results for the late-development stage showed that peatlands could function as carbon sources once warming and wetting was imposed but that peatland ecosystems during the mid-development stage can still function as carbon sinks under warming and wetting conditions. Moreover, peatland ecosystems have self-regulation capabilities so that they can go back to their normal ecological and biogeochemical functions under newly stabilized climates. Also, it is the change in temperature that results in the fundamental change in peatland development and carbon cycling. This study indicates that the response of peatland ecosystems to climate change is largely determined by their developmental stages.

AB Northern peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle representing a significant stock of soil carbon and a substantial natural source of atmospheric methane (CH(4)). Peatland carbon cycling is affected by water table position which is predicted to be lowered by climate change. Therefore we compared carbon fluxes along a natural peatland microtopographic gradient ( control) to an adjacent microtopographic gradient with an experimentally lowered water table ( experimental) during three growing seasons to assess the impact of water table drawdown on peatland-atmosphere carbon exchange. Water table drawdown induced peat subsidence and a change in the vegetation community at the experimental site. This limited differences in carbon dioxide (CO(2)) exchange between the control and experimental sites resulting in no significant differences between sites after three seasons. However, there was a trend to higher respiration rates and increased productivity in low-lying zones (hollows) and this was coincident with increased vegetation cover at these plots. In general, CH(4) efflux was reduced at the experimental site, although CH(4) efflux from control and experimental hollows remained similar throughout the study. The differential response of carbon cycling to the water table drawdown along the microtopographic gradient resulted in local topographic high zones ( hummocks) experiencing a relative increase in global warming potential (GWP) of 152%, while a 70% reduction in GWP was observed at hollows. Thus the distribution and composition of microtopographic elements, or microforms, within a peatland is important for determining how peatland carbon cycling will respond to climate change.

AB A peat core from an ombrotrophic mire in central Sweden was analysed for multi-proxy indicators (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, restate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk densities, loss on ignition), to evaluate the relative contributions of climate change and human impact on vegetation and peat accumulation during the last c. 350 years. C-14 wiggle-match daring was applied for high precision dating. Testate amoebae assemblages were used to reconstruct past water table depths and compared with other proxies and instrumental climate data from the mid-18th century onwards, Changes in mire surface wetness were mainly caused by climate change (precipitation and evaporation), but the internal dynamics of the local bog vegetation may also have played a role in the recorded water table changes. The human impact signal in the pollen data was compared with Swedish population and land-use data. A link between climate change, human impact (openness of the vegetation) and demographic change was found. Cold and wet periods show a decrease in human impact and open land indicators in the pollen data, followed by an increase in death rate and/or an increase in emigration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ombrogenous mires, or bogs, are remarkable in that they are organic landforms built from living plants and their partially decayed remains (peat), together with large quantities of water derived directly from precipitation. In the uplands and northwest of the British Isles, they tend to dominate landscapes wherever the slope allows. The components of ombrogenous mires are highly sensitive to change, especially in hydrology. Their vegetation may alter in response to very small changes in water level and/or water chemistry, whereas the underlying peat may undergo total degradation on dewatering. The function of intact mire ecosystems incorporates mechanisms which tend to maintain stability when environmental conditions change; observation indicates, however, that the stability threshold may be crossed under some natural as well as some man-induced circumstances. Sensitivity is demonstrated by evidence from the plant remains preserved in the pear; from manipulation of management practices (particularly grazing and burning); from long-term (28-68 years) mapping of vegetation change, and from experimentation on the sensitivity of bog plants to components of air pollution. The ultimate manifestation of sensitivity is pent erosion, which is widespread in the uplands and may, in places, have been ongoing for several hundred years. It is concluded that we may anticipate heightened sensitivity to cultural perturbation of mire ecosystems during times of climate change, and thus that particular care in our approach to management of blanket peat landscapes is indicated at the present time.

AB It is important to understand the fate of carbon in boreal peatland soils in response to climate change because a substantial change in release of this carbon as CO2 and CH4 could influence the climate system. The goal of this research was to synthesize the results of a field water table manipulation experiment conducted in a boreal rich fen into a process-based model to understand how soil organic carbon (SOC) of the rich fen might respond to projected climate change. This model, the peatland version of the dynamic organic soil Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (peatland DOS-TEM), was calibrated with data collected during 2005-2011 from the control treatment of a boreal rich fen in the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX). The performance of the model was validated with the experimental data measured from the raised and lowered water-table treatments of APEX during the same period. The model was then applied to simulate future SOC dynamics of the rich fen control site under various CO2 emission scenarios. The results across these emissions scenarios suggest that the rate of SOC sequestration in the rich fen will increase between year 2012 and 2061 because the effects of warming increase heterotrophic respiration less than they increase carbon inputs via production. However, after 2061, the rate of SOC sequestration will be weakened and, as a result, the rich fen will likely become a carbon source to the atmosphere between 2062 and 2099. During this period, the effects of projected warming increase respiration so that it is greater than carbon inputs via production. Although changes in precipitation alone had relatively little effect on the dynamics of SOC, changes in precipitation did interact with warming to influence SOC dynamics for some climate scenarios.

AB The density of maar lake type peatlands in the Changbai Mountain areas, northeast (NE) China is among the highest in the world. These deposition systems include both peat and limnic deposits, providing valuable sites to study their evolutionary history shaped by their sensitivity to climate-forced state shifts. To investigate the maar lake-mire shift in response to hydroclimatic variability, we examined developmental history of the Jinchuan peatland based on sedimentary facies, grain-size, physical and chemical properites, plant macrofossils and peat basal age. The results indicate that the Jinchuan peatland mainly originated from paludification in a maar lake from approximately 7000 cal. BP. Its water level continuously increased since the Middle Holocene, reaching the peak during the period of 5000-4000 cal. yr BP. The outward expansions of Jinchuan peatland suggest a climate driven model based on which water level variability superimposes the underlying basin morphology. The hydroclimatic variability and peatland development history can be divided into three periods. From 12 to 7 ka cal. BP, the increasing East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) was the major water vapor source of Jinchuan peatland. The strong evaporation effects induced by the strong Winter Asian winter monsoon (WAWM) and the maximum sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of Japan Sea might have changed the Jinchuan maar lake into dry upland. From 7 to 4 ka cal. BP, the maximum EASM and increasing Westerly jet (WJ) provided water vapor for the peatland. The decreasing EAWM and SSTs of Japan Sea resulted in decreased evaporation effects. The moisture and water level in Jinchuan peatland gradually increased. The peat covered 68.97% of the area during this period. Since 4 ka cal. BP, the decreased EASM and the maximum WJ provided water vapor for the Jinchuan peatland. The weak EAWM and the lower SSTs of Japan Sea induced lower evaporation effects. The moisture and water level in the peatland reached the maximum. Subsequently, peat area further expanded and covered the remaining 31.03% area. This study reveals a remarkable link between the maar lake-mire shift and hydroclimatic variability, which is significant for future prediction of maar lake-mire ecosystem shifts under global climate change.

AB Northern peatlands are globally significant soil carbon sinks but contribute a significant amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to streams. Climate change driven warming and drying will likely alter peatland DOC dynamics; however, few field studies have quantified the individual and interactive effects of temperature and moisture changes. Using a full factorial water table (control, drained 2 years [experimental], drained 12 years [drained]) x warming (ambient, open-top chamber warming) x microform (hummock, hollow) study design, we monitored DOC concentration and spectrophotometric properties (specific ultraviolet absorbance [SUVA], E2/E3, E4/E6) in a wooded boreal bog in Alberta, Canada. Ecohydrological conditions including water table (WT), soil temperature, plant cover, biomass, and productivity were also measured at each plot. We observed a significant interaction between WT treatment, warming and microform for explaining variation in DOC concentrations, with the highest values at drained, warmed hummocks. Overall, drainage resulted in higher DOC concentration. DOC concentration and E2/E3 increased, whereas SUVA decreased, in response to greater plant productivity (i.e., more negative values of gross ecosystem photosynthesis). For DOC concentration and SUVA, this correlation was largely driven by drained, warmed hummocks where shrub growth increased. Moreover, redundancy analysis indicated that shrub and lichen cover, along with WT and soil temperature, were important for explaining variation in DOC concentration and quality. The results indicate that, although DOC concentrations in peatlands are likely to increase under climate change, much of this increase may be from recent carbon fixation, suggesting more rapid carbon cycling as opposed to destabilization of existing carbon stocks.

AB The production and decomposition of organic matter are major processes determining peat accumulation dynamics, both of which vary over different time scales. Here we evaluate three types of experimental and observational data related to peatlands, which are from litter, oxic (acrotelm) peat, and anoxic (catotelm) peat. The Pb-210-dated peat-core profiles for the last 100-200 years are used to understand the oxic decomposition processes; C-14-dated peat profiles for the last several millennia are used for understanding anoxic decomposition processes. Analysis of data from litter-bag experiments suggests that a significant portion of the litter is lost in the first few years owing primarily to rapid initial decomposition processes, including movement/leaching of soluble materials. This is also confirmed indirectly by Pb-210-dated peat-core data. Several records of acrotelm peat show similar estimated litter-addition (265 +/- 37.3 g m (-2) year (-1)) and decay rates (0.017 +/- 0.0047 year (-1)), despite the climatic difference among study areas. The litter-addition rate of 255 g m (-2) year (-1) is at most about half of measured net primary production. Warmer climate causes higher production but also higher decomposition. The balance of production and decay processes in the litter and acrotelm determines the peat addition rate to the catotelm, where long-term peat accumulation occurs. Our sensitivity analysis shows that change in the peat-addition rate would affect both young and old peat; in contrast, a change in the decay rate has more influence on old peat. We therefore hypothesize that the wiggles often seen in peat age-depth profiles are caused by changes in peat addition rates, which are determined by climatically sensitive processes including photosynthesis and acrotelm decomposition. Evaluating these litter and peat-core data provides insights useful to the design and implementation of a peatland dynamics simulation model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here, for the first time in SE Poland, we document the long-term development of a rich fen and assess its sensitivity to climate change and human impacts over the last ca. 3500 years. Our results are based on a high-resolution, continuous plant macrofossil remains, mollusc and pollen record, complemented by geochemical, mineral magnetic and physical characterisation, and radiocarbon dating from Bagno Serebryskie rich fen located in SE Poland. Based on the palaeoecological data we distinguished five stages of wet habitat conditions: 5000-3300, 2800-2150, 1600-1100, 750-230, 150-10 cal yr BP and five dry periods at ca. 3300-2800, 2150-1600, 1100-750, 230-150, 10 to 64 cal yr BP. The pollen and geochemistry records, particularly Pb, show that the first human activity in the study area occurred ca. 3200 cal yr BP and increased markedly from 500 cal yr BP affecting local plant development including the population size of Cladium mariscus. Our study has shown that despite human impact (drainage, fire), Bagno Serebryskie peatland has hosted rare, presently protected species, such as Cladium mariscus for hundreds of years. We conclude that, in common with ombrotrophic bogs, rich fen ecosystems can provide a reliable source of palaeoclimatic and palaeohydrological data. Our study also shows that a large peatland (376 ha) can be as sensitive a palaeohydrological archive as smaller mires. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands constitute major sinks of organic carbon (C) and play a key role in the global C cycle. Here, we present a synthesis of peat records from six ecoclimatic regions in Quebec, Canada, in order to quantify Holocene patterns of C accumulation and relationships with contemporary climate data. Average long-term apparent rates of C accumulation (LORCA) were calculated for 21 peat cores and range from 10 to 70 g C/m(2)/yr with a mean of 26.1 (standard error of mean (SEM) = 3.6) g C/m(2)/yr, which is slightly higher than the mean value for northern peatlands as a whole (Loisel et al., 2014). We found that regional climate has been a major factor controlling long-term peatland C accumulation and that site-specific factors may explain some variability between sites. Our data show that LORCA tend to decrease with latitude. The lowest LORCA are found in the northernmost peatlands located at the boreal forest/forest-tundra ecotone, whereas the highest values are recorded in the peatlands along the St. Lawrence Estuary, characterized by the highest mean summer temperature, number of growing degree-days above 0 degrees C and mean annual precipitation. Temporal variations in Holocene C accumulations rates were synthesized for 16 peat cores, which show high values during the mid-Holocene (6000-4000 cal. yr BP) followed by a decline during the Neoglacial cooling, especially between 2000 and 1200 cal. yr BP. Our study contributes to a better understanding of sensitivity of peatland C balance to climate change in a poorly documented part of the circumboreal region.

AB Peatlands are the largest natural carbon store as a result of environmental conditions that limit decomposition rates. However, climate change is predicted to threaten peatland C sink function through rising temperatures, lowered water tables and the expansion of vascular plants. Here, by selecting four peatland habitats differing in their dominant plant communities and abiotic conditions, we investigated the influence of the most relevant climatic factors (namely temperature and soil water content) in controlling the spatial and temporal responses of soil organisms and their potential links to above-ground plant functional diversity. We found that the soil mesofaunal communities under vascular plants were mainly dominated by microarthropods (oribatid mites and collembolans), and contrasted with those under mosses that consisted of enchytreids and dipterans (approximate to 15% dissimilarity). We show that the balance of tolerance to drought and saturation determined the temporal dynamics and vertical stratification of the soil invertebrate populations. From this, we anticipate that the projected expansion of vascular plants not only will displace active peat forming vegetation species (mosses), but also those invertebrates that are poorly adapted to the new environment (enchytraeids and dipteral larvae). Our findings indicate future peatland responses to environmental changes should take into account the habitat complexity above- and below-ground community structure) and the modulating effects of the abiotic environment.

AB Due to their unique flora, hydrology and environmental characteristics, peatlands are precious and specific habitats for microorganisms and microscopic animals. Their microbial network structure and their biomass are crucial for peatland carbon cycling, through primary production, as well as decomposition and mineralization of organic matter. Wetlands are one of the ecosystems most at risk from anthropogenic activities and climate change. Most recent scenarios of climate change for Central Europe predict an increase in air temperature and a decrease in annual precipitation. These changes may disturb the biodiversity of aquatic organisms, and the peat carbon sink. Considering the above climatic scenarios, we aimed to: i) assess the response of microbial community biomass to warming and reduced precipitation through the lens of a manipulative experiment in a peatland ecosystem ii) predict how global warming might affect microbial biodiversity on peatlands exposed to warmer temperatures and decreased precipitation conditions. Additionally, we wanted to identify ecological indicators of warming among microorganisms living in Sphagnum peatland. The result of a manipulative experiment carried out at Rzecin peatland (W Poland) suggested that the strongest reduction in microbial biomass was observed in heated plots and plots where heating was combined with a reduction of precipitation. The most pronounced changes were observed in the case of the very abundant mixotrophic testate amoeba Hyalosphenia papilio and cyanobacteria. Shifts in the Sphagnum microbial network can be used as an early warning indicator of peatland warming, especially a decrease in the biomass of important phototrophic microbes living on the Sphagnum capitula, e.g. Hyalosphenia papilio.

AB Peatlands, which account for approximately 15% of land surface across the arctic and boreal regions of the globe, are experiencing a range of ecological impacts as a result of climate change. Factors that include altered hydrology resulting from drought and permafrost thaw, rising temperatures, and elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide have been shown to cause plant community compositional changes. Shifts in plant composition affect the productivity, species diversity, and carbon cycling of peatlands. We used hyperspectral remote sensing to characterize the response of boreal peatland plant composition and species diversity to warming, hydrologic change, and elevated CO2. Hyperspectral remote sensing techniques offer the ability to complete landscape-scale analyses of ecological responses to climate disturbance when paired with plot-level measurements that link ecosystem biophysical properties with spectral reflectance signatures. Working within two large ecosystem manipulation experiments, we examined climate controls on composition and diversity in two types of common boreal peatlands: a nutrient rich fen located at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) in central Alaska, and an ombrotrophic bog located in northern Minnesota at the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. We found a strong effect of plant functional cover on spectral reflectance characteristics. We also found a positive relationship between species diversity and spectral variation at the APEX field site, which is consistent with other recently published findings. Based on the results of our field study, we performed a supervised land cover classification analysis on an aerial hyperspectral dataset to map peatland plant functional types (PFTs) across an area encompassing a range of different plant communities. Our results underscore recent advances in the application of remote sensing measurements to ecological research, particularly in far northern ecosystems.

AB Northern peatlands contain an estimated 1/3 of the world's soil carbon pool. This large carbon pool is of concern due to its uncertain future in a changing climate. Blanket bogs are peatlands that occur in temperate maritime regions where precipitation is much greater than evapotranspiration. We describe five years (1 October 2002 to 30 September 2007) of eddy-covariance (EC) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements in an Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland. The measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was partitioned into its components of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross ecosystem production (GEP). The inter-annual variation of the CO2 fluxes was investigated using correlation coefficient analyses with measured hydro-meteorological parameters. The annual NEE was negative for all five years (thus the peatland was a sink of CO2), ranging between -16.5 +/- 5.1 and -96.5 +/- 23.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) (average of -54.9 +/- 15.6 g C-CO2 m(-2)). During the study period, NEE was negative for the same five months in each year (May-September). NEE showed the highest CO2 uptake (due to the highest GEP) in the summer with intermediate rather than extreme meteorological conditions, thus with low vapour pressure deficit, intermediate soil water content, air temperature and light radiation, which might be partly explained by the role of the bryophyte community. Under climate change predictions of higher temperature, the inter-annual variation analysis suggests that ER might increase in winter. Furthermore, the predicted lower precipitation and higher temperature in the summer are expected to lead to lower GEP. The resulting increase in NEE (thus lower CO2 uptake) will be partly compensated by a higher GEP in warmer winters and in dryer autumns. Moreover, the CO2 uptake will benefit by a longer growing season, while wetter conditions will likely lower the ecosystem respiration in the spring. The length of the growing season was found to be driven by warmer winter and September soil temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A massive tufa complex in the lower Lorze Valley ( 550 m a.s.l., north-central Switzerland) formed between 9000 and 5000 cal. yr BP. In the plain 4 km southeast of the complex lies Neugrundmoor ( 830 m a.s.l.), a mire in the hydrologic recharge area of the springs responsible for the tufa formation. Here we address an earlier, untested hypothesis that the transition of Neugrundmoor from fen to raised bog caused the end of the tufa formation, by means of pollen and testate amoebae analyses on a peat section. The chronology of the section is based on ten AMS C-14-dates of terrestrial plant macrofossils. Our results suggest that until 7100 cal. yr BP the plain had shallow ponds, which gradually developed into fens. Starting 5350 cal. yr BP, large raised bogs developed in the fens in a few centuries. This agrees with the hypothesis that the end of tufa formation coincided with the transition from fen to raised bog. It also coincided with the end of the mid-Holocene temperature optimum, when climate became cooler and wetter. We suggest that the main factor causing the end of tufa formation at 5500-5000 cal. yr BP was declining air temperatures, which on the one hand led to diminished calcium precipitation, on the other to enhanced bog formation. Peat has a low hydraulic conductivity, so we suggest that less water became available for tufa formation because of increased thickness of peat layers, exacerbating the direct effect of cooling on calcium precipitation. Noticeable human influence in the surroundings did presumably not start before c. 3500 cal. yr BP and was then very weak, so this was not responsible for the end of the tufa formation. Extrapolation of our results suggests that climatic cooling alone is sufficient to explain the widespread termination of tufa formation after the mid Holocene.

AB High-latitude peatlands contain about one third of the world's soil organic carbon, most of which is derived from partly decomposed Sphagnum (peat moss) plants. We conducted a meta-analysis based on a global data set of Sphagnum growth measurements collected from published literature to investigate the effects of bioclimatic variables on Sphagnum growth. Analysis of variance and general linear models were used to relate Sphagnum magellanicum and S. fuscum growth rates to photosynthetically active radiation integrated over the growing season (PAR0) and a moisture index. We found that PAR0 was the main predictor of Sphagnum growth for the global data set, and effective moisture was only correlated with moss growth at continental sites. The strong correlation between Sphagnum growth and PAR0 suggests the existence of a global pattern of growth, with slow rates under cool climate and short growing seasons, highlighting the important role of growing season length in explaining peatland biomass production. Large-scale patterns of cloudiness during the growing season might also limit moss growth. Although considerable uncertainty remains over the carbon balance of peatlands under a changing climate, our results suggest that increasing PAR0 as a result of global warming and lengthening growing seasons, without major change in cloudiness, could promote Sphagnum growth. Assuming that production and decomposition have the same sensitivity to temperature, this enhanced growth could lead to greater peat-carbon sequestration, inducing a negative feedback to climate change.

AB Quantified analyses of plant macrofossil remains have been made from three profiles of peat from raised bogs spanning a distance of 425 km from western Ireland to northern England. The reconstructed vegetation of each profile is related to changing bog surface wetness (BSW), and since the bogs are ombrotrophic these BSW changes are interpreted in terms of changing climate. Using age/ depth models based on a total of 49 radiocarbon dates a number of wetter and drier phases are identified, and phase-shifts to wetter and/or cooler climates are defined.

AB Aim Bogs and transition mires in Central Europe have undergone tremendous changes in the last decades, declining in spatial extent and favourable conservation status. However, species extinctions have been documented only rarely because of a lack of reliable floristic data. Here, we assessed species losses of bog complexes and analysed their potential drivers.
   Location Black Forest, Germany.
   Methods We made use of the unique situation that the majority of bogs in the Black Forest (124 sites) had been systematically surveyed from 1972 to 1980 and resurveyed the flora of the same sites between 2017 and 2020. In addition, we included further data from the preceding decades.
   Results Out of 88 species for which we compiled site occupancy data, two species went extinct in the whole study area and 37 decreased from 1972 to 2020, losing on average 33% of their initial frequency. In contrast, 46 species displayed a positive trend. While decreasing species were characteristic of raised bogs, moorland ponds and base-rich mires, increasing species were typical of poor mires, fens and wet meadows. Species losses were higher at low elevation, pointing to increasing temperature increase and decreasing precipitation as main drivers of extinction, while habitat area, distance to the nearest site and land use played no significant role. The mean altitude at which extinctions of populations occurred increased with time. Assuming a continuation of the observed negative trends for declining bog species, our models predict the extinction of further ten species by 2045.
   Main Conclusion Our study highlights the value of systematic and comprehensive past biodiversity surveys to assess biodiversity change. We demonstrated that low-mountain habitats have already suffered biodiversity loss as a result of climate change. There are only limited management options against rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation.

AB Boreal peatlands are substantial sources of isoprene, a reactive hydrocarbon. However, it is not known how much mosses, vascular plants and peat each contribute to isoprene emission from peatlands. Furthermore, there is no information on the effects of declining water table depth on isoprene emission in these naturally wet ecosystems, although water table is predicted to decline due to climate warming. We studied the relative contribution of mosses vs. vascular plants to isoprene emission in boreal peatland microcosms in growth chambers by removing either vascular vegetation or both vascular vegetation and mosses. The microcosms represented wet hollows and dry hummocks of a boreal ombrotrophic bog. A water table drawdown treatment was applied to the hollows with naturally high water table. The mean (+/- SE) isoprene emission from hummocks with intact vegetation, 30 +/- 6 mu g m(-2) h(-1), was decreased by over 90% with removal of vascular plants or all vegetation. Thus, our results indicate that vascular plants, in contrast to mosses, were the main source of isoprene in the studied peatland ecosystem. Water table drawdown also significantly decreased the emissions: the mean isoprene emission from hollows with intact vegetation, 45 +/- 6 mu g m(-2) h(-1), was decreased by 25% under water table drawdown. However, water table drawdown reduced net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange more dramatically than isoprene emission. Isoprene emission strongly correlated with both CO2 exchange and methane emission. In conclusion, isoprene emissions from peatlands will decrease, but the proportion of assimilated carbon lost as isoprene will increase, if the naturally high water table declines under the changing climate.

AB Boreal mire ecosystems are predicted to experience warmer air temperatures as well as changed deposition loads of nitrogen and sulfur during the coming century. In this study, we hypothesized that vegetation changes that accompany these new environmental conditions alter the chemical composition of peat. To test this hypothesis, we quantified changes in peat geochemistry (Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Na, P, Pb, and Zn) that have occurred in field manipulation plots exposed to 12 years of warming and nitrogen and sulfur additions in a nutrient-poor boreal mire. In Contrast to non-nutrients with a mainly atmospheric origin (i.e. Pb), Al-normalized inventories of micronutrients (Zn and Fe) and macronutrients (P and Ca) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher as a result of warming. For P and Ca, enrichments were also induced by nitrogen additions alone. These results suggest that mires evolving under increasing temperatures and availability of nitrogen are around two times More effective in storing nutrients in the accumulating peat. Our study provides the first empirical evidence that predicted changes in climate and nitrogen deposition scenarios will increase the retention of Ca, Fe, P, and Zn in surface peat of boreal mires in the near future, which may cause a depletion of nutrients released to inland waters dependent on mire inputs.

AB A peat core from a mire with poor fen lawns and ombrotrophic hummock strings in Northern Sweden was examined (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, testate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk densities, loss on ignition) to investigate the effects of climate change and human impact on the plant species composition and peat accumulation of the peat forming vegetation during the last 1700 yr. C-14 wiggle-match dating was applied for high-precision dating. The Lappmyran region was dominated by Pinus and Picea forest. Changes in land-use patterns and population density were visible in the pollen record of the regional vegetation. Juniperus and Rumex acetosa-type pollen indicated the presence of grazed land in the area between AD 1500 and 1950. The vegetation at the coring spot gradually became ombrotrophic. The local plant and testate amoebae compositions reflect changes in surface wetness caused by changes in precipitation and the internal dynamics of the bog. A wet interval was observed during the Maunder minimum of solar activity. The presence of Drepanocladus fluitans indicates less ombrotrophic conditions during this period probably caused by the inflow of minerogenic water from upslope owing to increased precipitation. The reconstructed water table shows agreement with precipitation measurements which were available since AD 1860. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water and energy fluxes control the development of northern peatlands and influence their carbon budget. Blanket bogs are peatlands that occur in temperate maritime regions where precipitation is much greater than evapotranspiration (ET). In this paper, five years (October 2002-September 2007) of ET and energy fluxes derived from eddy-covariance measurements were analyzed in the context of the predicted climate change for Ireland. Monthly ET at the Glencar Atlantic blanket bog varied little, ranging between a minimum of 12 mm month(-1) and a maximum of 56 mm month-1 over the five years, resulting in an annual ET average of 394 mm, with typical highest daily values of 2.5-3.0 mm. Compared to other peatland types, Glencar had lower summer ET and a lower ET/potential ET ratio, despite having higher precipitation and water table. The ET was limited not only by the low vapor pressure deficit and cool summer temperatures but also by the low cover of vascular plants and mosses (essential for transpiration). The energy budget was similar to other peatland types in terms of net radiation and sensible heat fluxes, but had lower latent and higher ground heat fluxes. A comparison among the five years suggests that the predicted climate change (greater winter precipitation, lower summer precipitation, and higher all year round temperatures) will probably increase winter ET, while the summer energy flux patterns will not be profoundly affected. However, if the frequency of summer rain events should diminish, the moss component of these ecosystems may become water stressed, ultimately leading to lower evapotranspiration.

AB Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured by a chamber technique from June to September, 1994, at five peatland sites where the water table was close to the peat surface, ranging from ombrotrophic bog to minerotrophic fen, near Thompson, Manitoba. NEE measurements were made during three 10-14-day periods, and CO2 exchange relationships with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air and soil temperatures, and water table were used to model net ecosystem productivity (NEP) for the season. Daily NEE ranged from -3 to 5 g CO2-C m(2) d(-1), with positive values indicating uptake by the land surface. Two of the sites became sources of CO2 during the late summer, associated with plant senescence and falling water tables. Average NEP for lune to August ranged from 1.4 to 2.5 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1). Both water table position and end-of-season above-ground sedge biomass were strong predictors of NEP during each measurement period as well as over the lune to August period Sites with high NEP had high aboveground sedge biomass (75 to 100 g m(-2)) and low water tables (seasonal average -5 to -10 cm).

AB Subarctic permafrost peatlands cover extensive areas and store large amounts of soil organic carbon that can be remobilized as active layer deepening and thermokarst formation increase in a future warmer climate. Better knowledge of ground thermal variability within these ecosystems is important for understanding future landscape development and permafrost carbon feedbacks. In a peat plateau complex in Tavvavuoma, northern Sweden, ground temperatures and snow depth have been monitored in six different landscape units: on a peat plateau, in a depression within a peat plateau, along a peat plateau edge (close to a thermokarst lake), at a thermokarst lake shoreline, in a thermokarst lake and in a fen. Permafrost is present in all three peat plateau landscape units, and mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) in the central parts of the peat plateau is -0.3 degrees C at 2 m depth. In the three low-lying wetter or saturated landscape units (along the thermokarst lake shoreline, in the lake and the fen) taliks are present and MAGT at 1 m depth is 1.0-2.7 degrees C. Topographical differences between the elevated and low-lying units affect both local snow depth and soil moisture, and are important for ground thermal patterns in this landscape. Permafrost exists in landscape units with a shallow mean December-April snow depth (<20 cm) whereas snow depths >40 cm mostly result in absence of permafrost.

AB Interactions between headwater aquifers and peatlands have received limited scientific attention. Hydrological stresses, including those related to climate change, may adversely impact these interactions. In this study, the dynamics of a southern Quebec headwater system where a peatland is present is simulated under current conditions and with climate change. The model is calibrated in steady state on field-measured data and provides satisfactory results for transient-state conditions. Under current conditions, simulations confirm that the peatland is fed by the fractured bedrock aquifer year-round and provides continuous baseflow to its outlets. Climate change is simulated through its impact on groundwater recharge. Predicted precipitation and temperature data from a suite of regional climate model scenarios provide a net precipitation variation range from +10% to -30% for the 2041-2070 horizon. Calibrated recharge is modified within this range to perform a sensitivity analysis of the headwater model to recharge variations (+10%, -15% and -30%). Total contribution from the aquifer to rivers and streams varies from +14% to -44% of the baseline for +10% to -30% recharge changes from spring 2010 data, for example. With higher recharge, the peatland receives more groundwater, which could significantly change its vegetation pattern and eventually ecosystem functions. For a -30% recharge, the peatland becomes perched above the aquifer during the summer, fall and winter. Recharge reductions also induce sharp declines in groundwater levels and drying streams.

AB Environmental and biological variables fluctuate over different time scales. On the basis of power spectral analysis of 14 time series at four sites from northern peatlands (fens and raised bogs), the temporal variability of physical environment (temperatures, water tables) and biological variables (CO2 flux) shows power-law behaviour, with a scaling exponent ranging from about 0.5 to 1.5. The scaling exponents of air temperatures change from 1.5 at high frequency to 0.5 at low frequency, with a break point at diurnal period. Comparison with similar analysis of temperature data from climate stations suggests that the atmosphere above peatlands has more active heat exchange with waterlogged peatlands than with upland terrestrial ecosystems. Water tables from different peatlands show almost identical power spectra, with a scaling exponent of 1.0 over all time scales. CO2 exchange has more complex spectral structure, with two break points at daily and monthly periods. This spectral structure suggests scale-dependent influence of climatic and hydrological fluctuations on CO2 fluxes. CO2 flux responds to air temperature with a distinct diurnal spectral peak. These results indicate that time scales are important in discussing hydrology and carbon dynamics in peatlands, and that scaling up of short-term experimental results may be inadvisable. Further statistical analysis on drained and harvested peatlands would provide insights into understanding shift in peatland dynamics due to human disturbance. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aims Global change is shown to significantly affect the C storage function of peatlands; however, a majority of previous research is focused on a single environmental stressor such as the increased temperature. As a result, little is known about the interactive effect of multiple environmental stressors on peatland C storage, especially in sedge-dominated fen peatlands. Methods We performed a full factorial experiment of increased temperature and elevated atmospheric CO(2)concentration on minerotrophic, sedge-dominated fen monoliths to experimentally examine the individual and interactive effects of simulated future climate conditions on peatland plant biomass, CO(2)exchange, and pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over one full growing season. Results Our study demonstrates that warming and elevated atmospheric CO(2)significantly increased aboveground and belowground biomass, respectively, as well as the gross ecosystem production (GEP), while the DOC concentrations and respired CO(2)from peatland soils only increased under warming Conclusions Our results suggest that global change will increase both plant production and microbial decomposition, but with altered plant biomass allocation between aboveground and belowground. Our study provides experimental evidence for shifts in ecosystem-level carbon dynamics under global change for a sedge-dominated peatland, and suggests that while carbon stores may weaken, the carbon sink will be maintained in these types of northern peatlands if hydrological conditions are largely maintained.

AB We incubated intact peat cores from depth intervals of 5-15, 15-25, 25-35, and 35-45 cm from ombrotrophic bog, poor fen, and beaver pond margin sections of a cool-temperate peatland. CO2 production was measured over 12-day incubation periods at 4 and 14 degrees C and under oxic and anoxic conditions. Rates ranged from 0.06 to 0.66 mg CO2 g(-1) dry peat d(-1) under oxic conditions and from 0.002 to 0.098 mg CO2 g(-1) d(-1) under anoxic conditions, and rates generally decreased with depth in the profiles. When expressed on a volumetric basis, production rates ranged from 0.3 to 23.4 g CO2 m(-3) d(-1), and there was much less variation in CO2 production rates within profiles because the bull; density of peat increased with depth. The Q(10) quotient, between 4 and 14 degrees C, ranged from 1.0 to 7.7, depending on sample and incubation conditions, with an average of 2.0 for oxic and 2.7 for anoxic conditions. Oxic:anoxic ratios averaged 7:1, 16:1, and 12:1 for the bog, poor fen, and beaver pond margin samples, respectively. Degree of decomposition (von Post index) was the substrate property most strongly correlated with CO2 production. Based on temperature and incubation data for the peat profiles to a depth of 45 cm, annual decomposition values (k) ranged from 0.016 to 0.060 yr(-1) under oxic conditions and from 0.001 to 0.007 yr(-1) under anoxic conditions. A model of CO2 emission from the three sites, based on the incubation data and thermal and water table regime, gave good agreement with measured in Situ CO2 emission rates (r(2) = 0.72, n = 18), although summer emission rates were underpredicted, possibly because of the absence of a root production component in the incubations or because of underestimation of CO2 production rates in held conditions above the water table.

AB Peatlands are major carbon sinks globally, but it is still unclear what drives their shift from functioning as carbon sink to a source. Fungi rely on soil carbon inputs and play an active role in carbon mobilization and stabilization. Future climate change scenarios predict increases in temperature and lower water tables, which may lead to functional shifts in fungal communities growing in peatlands. Despite their abundance, the impact of fungi on carbon cycling in peatlands is still poorly understood. Therefore, it is crucial to study the dynamics and distribution of fungal communities in pristine peatlands in order to predict the potential changes in peatland ecosystems more accurately. Here, we review the current knowledge about fungal communities in peatlands, including the influence of peatland type, abiotic factors, and temporal and spatial dynamics on fungal diversity. Our overview shows that fungal diversity in peatlands of certain regions such as tropical areas is severely understudied. Furthermore, we examine the ecological roles and the relative contribution to carbon cycling of functional guilds of fungi in peatlands, showing that saprotrophs are the key guild in organic matter decomposition, and ericoid- and ectomycorrhizal fungi have the ability to act as decomposers and vectors of plant carbon input to soil. We suggest that the application of a combination of methodological approaches for taxonomic and functional characterisation of peatland fungal communities is needed to build better understanding about the diversity-functioning relationships in peatland ecosystems. Overall, this review shows that fungi must be considered as important drivers of mechanistic processes underlying biodiversity, plant nutrient uptake and carbon losses in peatlands.

AB Climate warming is predicted to increase heterotrophic metabolism in northern peatland soils leading to enhanced greenhouse gas emissions. However, the specific relationships between temperature and the greenhouse gas producing microbial communities are poorly understood. Thus, in this study, the temperature dependence of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production rates along with abundance and composition of microbial communities were investigated in peat from a Sphagnum-dominated peatland, S1 bog (Minnesota, United States). Whereas CH4 production rates increased with temperature up to 30 degrees C, CO2 production did not, resulting in a lower CO2:CH4 ratio with increasing temperature. CO2 production showed both psychrophilic and mesophilic maxima at 4 and 20 degrees C, respectively, and appears to be mediated by two anaerobic microbial communities, one that operates under psychrophilic conditions that predominate for much of the year, and another that is more active under warmer conditions during the growing season. In incubations at 10 degrees C above the ambient range, members of the Clostridiaceae and hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the Methanobacteriaceae dominated. Moreover, a significant negative correlation between temperature and microbial diversity was observed. Results indicate that the potential consequences of warming surface peat in northern peatlands include a large stimulation in CH4 production and a significant loss of microbial diversity.

AB The peat stratigraphy (plant macrofossils, colorimetric humification, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, carbon/nitrogen ratios) of three replicate cores from a raised peat bog in the UK (Walton Moss) and a single core from a raised peat bog in Denmark (Lille Vildmose) were examined in an attempt to investigate the relation between long-term climate change and changes in species composition of the peat-forming vegetation. Nine wet-shifts identified in the monoliths from Walton Moss and Lille Vildmose mainly occurred during periods of increasing atmospheric C-14 content. Because fluctuations in Holocene atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations have been shown to be due to variations in solar activity, the Little Ice Age (LIA) climatic deteriorations registered in both peat bogs were probably driven by changes in solar activity. Climatic deteriorations in the three replicate cores from Walton Moss are not all consistently registered and may reflect the internal variability in the extent of hollow/lawn/hummock microforms within raised peat-bog ecosystems. The lowest carbon accumulation values for the Walton Moss monoliths between ca. cal AD 1300 and 1800 and between ca. cal AD 1490 and 1580 for Lille Vildmose occurred during the course of LIA climatic deteriorations. Peat-bog primary productivity may have been reduced during the LIA owing to lower spring-summer temperatures and shorter growing seasons for the peat-forming plants. Species-specific higher decomposition rates may have also caused the lower carbon accumulation rates in the peat bogs during the LIA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Changes to climate are projected over the next 50 years for many peatland areas. As decomposition of peat forming vegetation is likely to be intrinsically linked to these changes in climate, a clear understanding of climate-peat dynamics is required. There is concern that increased temperature and decreased precipitation could increase the rate of decomposition and put the carbon sink status of many peatlands at risk, yet few studies have examined the impact of both climatic factors together. To better understand the sensitivity of peatland decomposition to changes in both temperature and precipitation and their interaction, we conducted a short-term laboratory experiment in which plant litters and peat soil were incubated, in isolation, in a factorial design. Treatments simulated baseline and projected climate averages derived from the latest UK climate change projections (UKCP09) for Exmoor, a climatically marginal peatland in SW England. Regular carbon dioxide flux measurements were made throughout the simulation, as well as total mass loss and total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leached. The largest effect on carbon loss in this multifactor experiment was from substrate, with Sphagnum/peat releasing significantly less C in total during the experiment than dwarf shrubs/graminoids. Climate effects were substrate specific, with the drier rainfall treatment increasing the DOC leaching from Callum, but decreasing it from Sphagnum. Partitioning between CO2 and DOC was also affected by climate, but only for the peat and Sphagnum samples, where the future climate scenarios (warmer and drier) resulted in a greater proportion of C lost in gaseous form. These results suggest that indirect effects of climate through changes in species composition in peatlands could ultimately turn out to be more important for litter decomposition than direct effects of climate change from increased temperatures and decreased rainfall.

AB The importance of characterizing the ecohydrological interactions in natural, damaged/drained, and restored bogs is underscored by the importance of peatlands to global climate change and the growing need for peatland restoration. An understudied aspect of peatland ecohydrology is how shallow lateral flow impacts local hydrological conditions and water balance, which are critical for peatland restoration success. A novel method is presented using microcosms installed in the field to understand the dynamics of shallow lateral flow. Analysis of the difference in water table fluctuation inside and outside the microcosm experimental areas allowed the water balance to be constrained and the calculation of lateral flow and evapotranspiration. As an initial demonstration of this method, a series of four microcosm experiments were set up in locations with differing ecological quality and land management histories, on a raised bog complex in the midlands of Ireland. The timing and magnitude of the lateral flow differed considerably between locations with differing ecological conditions, indicating that shallow lateral flow is an important determining factor in the ecohydrological trajectory of a recovering bog system. For locations whereSphagnumspp. moss layer was present, a slow continuous net lateral input of water from the upstream catchment area supported the water table during drought periods, which was not observed in locations lackingSphagnum. Consistent with other studies, evapotranspiration was greater in locations with aSpaghnummoss layer than in locations with a surface of peat soil.

AB The development of northern high-latitude peatlands played an important role in the carbon (C) balance of the land biosphere since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). At present, carbon storage in northern peatlands is substantial and estimated to be 500 100 Pg C (1 Pg C = 1015 g C). Here, we develop and apply a peatland module embedded in a dynamic global vegetation and land surface process model (LPX-Bern 1.0). The peatland module features a dynamic nitrogen cycle, a dynamic C transfer between peatland acrotelm (upper oxic layer) and catotelm (deep anoxic layer), hydrology- and temperature-dependent respiration rates, and peatland specific plant functional types. Nitrogen limitation down-regulates average modern net primary productivity over peatlands by about half. Decadal acrotelm-to-catotelm C fluxes vary between 20 and +50 g C M-2 yr-1 over the Holocene. Key model parameters are calibrated with reconstructed peat accumulation rates from peat-core data. The model reproduces the major features of the peat core data and of the observation-based modern circumpolar soil carbon distribution. Results from a set of simulations for possible evolutions of northern peat development and areal extent show that soil C stocks in modern peatlands increased by 365-550 Pg C since the LGM, of which 175-272 Pg C accumulated between 11 and 5 kyr BR Furthermore, our simulations suggest a persistent C sequestration rate of 35-50 Pg C per 1000 yr in present-day peatlands under current climate conditions, and that this C sink could either sustain or turn towards a source by 2100 AD depending on climate trajectories as projected for different representative greenhouse gas concentration pathways.

AB Fungi play a pivotal role in the carbon sequestration potential of boreal peatlands through the process of decomposition. As such, climate-driven changes in the diversity and community composition of peatland fungal communities could have substantial impacts on carbon release from these ecosystems, especially in subsurface peat that represents an important global carbon stock. We used Illumina MiSeq sequencing of rDNA to examine fungal communities after 18 months in intact peatland mesocosms subjected to conditions associated with Canada's future climate, including: warming, elevated atmospheric CO2 and lowered water table. Warming was the main driver of changes in fungal communities across three depths of the peat profile with both Ascomycotaand Basidiomycota-dominated groups becoming more homogenous under warming conditions. Specific changes in fungal functional groups, however, were temperature dependent with potential cellulose decomposers and mycorrhizal root-associated fungi from Basidiomycota dominant under warming of +4 degrees C, whereas there was a prevalence of potential lignocellulose decomposers and mycorrhizal root-associated fungi from Ascomycota under +8 degrees C warming. These climate change-induced shifts in the structure of fungal communities in favour of recalcitrant compound decomposers observed across a depth gradient, may reduce long-term carbon storage of boreal peatlands under future climate change scenarios.

AB Peatlands play an important role in global climate change through sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Climatedriven changes in the structure of fungal communities in boreal peatlands that favor saprotrophic fungi can substantially impact carbon dynamics and nutrient cycling in these crucial ecosystems. In a mesocosm study using a full factorial design, 100 intact peat monoliths, complete with living Sphagnum and above-ground vascular vegetation, were subjected to three climate change variables (increased temperature, reduced water table, and elevated CO2 concentrations). Peat litterbags were placed in mesocosms, and fungal communities in litterbags were monitored over 12 months to assess the impacts of climate change variables on peat-inhabiting fungi. Changes in fungal richness, diversity, and community composition were assessed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ribosomal DNA (rDNA). While general fungal richness reduced under warming conditions, Ascomycota exhibited higher diversity under increased temperature treatments over the course of the experiment. Both increased temperature and lowered water table position drove shifts in fungal community composition with a strong positive effect on endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi (including one operational taxonomic unit (OTU) tentatively identified as Barrenia panicia) and different groups of saprotrophs identified as Mortierella, Galerina, and Mycena. These shifts were observed during a predicted degradative succession in the decomposer community as different carbon substrates became available. Since fungi play a central role in peatland communities, increased abundances of saprotrophic fungi under warming conditions, at the expense of reduced fungal richness overall, may increase decomposition rates under future climate scenarios and could potentially aggravate the impacts of climate change.

AB Boreal peatlands may be vulnerable to projected changes in the wildfire regime under future climates. Extreme drying during the sensitive postfire period may exceed peatland ecohydrological resilience, triggering long-term degradation of these globally significant carbon stocks. Despite these concerns, we show low peatland evapotranspiration at both the plot- and landscape-scale postfire, in water-limited peatlands dominated by feather moss that are ubiquitous across continental western Canada. Low postfire evapotranspiration enhances the resilience of carbon stocks in such peatlands to wildfire disturbance and reinforces their function as a regional source of water. Near-surface water repellency may provide an important, previously unexplored, regulator of peatland evapotranspiration that can induce low evapotranspiration in the initial postfire years by restricting the supply of water to the peat surface.

AB Despite the many studies about peatland development and carbon dynamics in China, especially for Zoige peatlands on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, few apply modeling as an effective approach to study peatland development. In order to fill up the knowledge gaps of China alpine peatland development and to provide a comparison with previous research, we studied the Zoige peatlands in Holocene with a modeling approach.
   Simulated results were obtained by the Holocene peatland model (HPM). Driving data was reconstructed based on paleoclimate studies. Model calibration and performance index validation were done by comparing the model output with literature data about peat age depth.
   Based on our results, the peat cohort mass mean accumulation rate was 0.45 mm year(-1) (ranging from 0.38 to 0.50 mm year(-1)). The mean C accumulation rate was about 0.026 kg C m(-2) year(-1) (ranging from 0.023 to 0.029 kg C m(-2) year(-1)), with a peak accumulation rate around 7 ka to 6 ka BP during the Holocene. The peat depth was 5.38 m (ranging from 4.6 to 5.99 m). The total peat storage in Zoige was about 1.76 Pg (ranging from 1.58 to 2.29 pg), and the carbon stock was estimated as 0.432 pg C (ranging from 0.348 to 0.479 pg C) in Zoige peatlands during the Holocene. After model calibration and validation, simulated results indicated that peat development and carbon accumulation were controlled by variation of water table depth (WTD).
   Simulated results indicated that the Zoige peatlands are the most important component of peatlands in China in terms of carbon stock. Though HPM lacks in driving data of temperature and incomplete climate factors, its limitations in the parameter setting should not offset the added value of the modeling approach in improving our understanding of peatland carbon and their controlling factor dynamics at the long-term scales in the Zoige region where there are very few studies so far.

AB Ecosystems adapt differently to global warming through microclimatic factors. Mires are sensitive wetland habitats that strongly rely on local soil properties, making them a good model to understand how local climatic parameters counteract the effects of climate change. We quantified the temperature buffering effect in waterlogged mire soils as compared with adjacent dry soils. We buried dataloggers at 5 cm depth in waterlogged and dry points in eight mires of the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain, southwestern Europe) and recorded soil temperatures for ca. 5 years. We also compared our local measures with air temperatures predicted by the CHELSA model. Waterlogged soils had less diurnal thermal amplitude (-2.3 degrees C), less annual thermal amplitude (-5.1 degrees C), cooler summer maxima (-4.3 degrees C) and warmer winter minima (+0.8 degrees C). CHELSA air temperatures only correlated significantly (p < .05) with winter minimum soil temperatures (Pearson's r > .83), and CHELSA predictions were less accurate (higher root-mean-square error [RMSE]) for waterlogged soils, except for the summer maxima. We conclude that mire soils show a thermal buffer effect that insulates them from the surrounding landscape. This effect is stronger at the warm end of the climatic spectrum, that is, during summer and at lower elevations. These results highlight the potential refugial character of mires under global warming, and the need to integrate microclimate measurements into climate change models.

AB Peatlands store globally significant quantities of soil carbon, and Sphagnum moss is the main peat forming vegetation type in bogs. Sphagnum moss productivity is driven by the moisture content of its apical cluster of branches, the capitulum. Capitulum moisture content is dependent on the arrangement of leaves, branches and stems for a given species and also on hydrological conditions of the underlying peat. Despite this link, the response of CO2 exchange in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands to extreme drought is still unclear, particularly under field conditions.
   We used drainage to expose Sphagnum rubellum to extreme drought and monitored water table, volumetric water content (VWC), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at plots in a 25 m transect perpendicular to a deep drainage ditch and compared results to an undrained site. VWC in the upper 10 cm of peat was strongly related to water table at depths shallower than 55 cm. Below this depth, near surface VWC remained relatively constant between 25 and 28% and Sphagnum GEP was effectively shut down. This also resulted in decreased ER at these locations. The combined effect was a linear relationship between VWC and NEE with moist sites acting as net CO2 sinks (up to -5 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) whereas sites closest to the ditch were consistently small carbon sources. We suggest that understanding how climate change will alter peatland hydrology relative to the moisture thresholds of Sphagnum mosses is critical to determining the fate of their carbon sink function.

AB [1] If boreal peatlands face drought more often due to climatic warming, the responses of vegetation may drastically change the functions of the ecosystem. We assessed the effects of water-level drawdown on plant-mediated organic matter (OM) and nutrient fluxes in a chronosequence of undrained and drained, originally sparsely treed fens. The chronosequence mimicked the reduced growing season moisture predicted by current climate change scenarios. In a pristine state, OM and nutrient fluxes were characterized by annual cycling through graminoids and mosses. Water-level drawdown initiated a "forest succession, '' in which the OM and nutrient cycles shifted from being dominated by graminoids and mosses to dominance by arboreal vegetation in two decades. Simultaneously, the quantity and tissue type composition of annual litterfall, as well as the quantity and allocation of annual nutrient uptake, changed radically. The changes may have contrasting but as yet unexplored implications for the carbon and nutrient balances of these sites.

AB Sphagnum mosses are keystone components of peatland ecosystems. They facilitate the accumulation of carbon in peat deposits, but climate change is predicted to expose peatland ecosystem to sustained and unprecedented warming leading to a significant release of carbon to the atmosphere. Sphagnum responses to climate change, and their interaction with other components of the ecosystem, will determine the future trajectory of carbon fluxes in peatlands. We measured the growth and productivity of Sphagnum in an ombrotrophic bog in northern Minnesota, where ten 12.8-m-diameter plots were exposed to a range of whole-ecosystem (air and soil) warming treatments (+0 to +9 degrees C) in ambient or elevated (+500 ppm) CO2. The experiment is unique in its spatial and temporal scale, a focus on response surface analysis encompassing the range of elevated temperature predicted to occur this century, and consideration of an effect of co-occurring CO2 altering the temperature response surface. In the second year of warming, dry matter increment of Sphagnum increased with modest warming to a maximum at 5 degrees C above ambient and decreased with additional warming. Sphagnum cover declined from close to 100% of the ground area to <50% in the warmest enclosures. After three years of warming, annual Sphagnum productivity declined linearly with increasing temperature (13-29 g C/m(2) per degrees C warming) due to widespread desiccation and loss of Sphagnum. Productivity was less in elevated CO2 enclosures, which we attribute to increased shading by shrubs. Sphagnum desiccation and growth responses were associated with the effects of warming on hydrology. The rapid decline of the Sphagnum community with sustained warming, which appears to be irreversible, can be expected to have many follow-on consequences to the structure and function of this and similar ecosystems, with significant feedbacks to the global carbon cycle and climate change.

AB Peatlands store a significant amount of terrestrial organic carbon in plant biomass and soils. The Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) project is a warming and elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) experiment designed to test how the carbon sequestration and storage capacity of peatland ecosystems will respond to climate change. Here, we report changes in the vascular plant community that have occurred during the first five years of SPRUCE. We tracked species composition, diversity, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in chambers warmed at a wide range of temperatures (+0, +2.25, +4.5, +6.75, +9 degrees C), and two CO2 levels (similar to 400 [ambient] and 900 parts per million). We observed an increase in aboveground vascular plant biomass accumulation, due primarily to an increase in shrub abundance. Overall species diversity decreased substantially, likely due in part to shading by increases in shrub density. The main driver of change in the vascular plant community was temperature, with minimal effects of CO2 evident. These results indicate an overall increase in ANPP with warming, but highlight the importance of interactions between direct (warming) and indirect (competition) effects in determining how boreal peatlands will respond to climate change.

AB Northern peatland ecosystems represent large carbon (C) stocks that are susceptible to changes such as accelerated mineralization due to water table lowering expected under a climate change scenario. During the growing seasons (1 May to 31 October) of 2011 and 2012 we monitored CO2 fluxes and plant biomass along a microtopographic gradient (hummocks- hollows) in an undisturbed dry continental boreal treed bog (control) and a nearby site that was drained (drained) in 2001. Ten years of drainage in the bog significantly increased coverage of shrubs at hummocks and lichens at hollows. Considering measured hummock coverage and including tree incremental growth, we estimate that the control site was a sink of -92 in 2011 and -70 g C m(-2) in 2012, while the drained site was a source of 27 and 23 g C m-2 over the same years. We infer that, drainage-induced changes in vegetation growth led to increased biomass to counteract a portion of soil carbon losses. These results suggest that spatial variability (microtopography) and changes in vegetation community in boreal peatlands will affect how these ecosystems respond to lowered water table potentially induced by climate change.

AB Two 50 - cm long peat cores from the Hani mire on the western slope of the Changbai Mountains, northeastern China, were collected for investigating physical, biological and geochemical processes of the peatland in response to recent climate change. The C-14 dating using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on the peat cores provides "a nuclear bomb carbon curve" which is used for peat chronological construction. The sedimentation rate (SR) of Core S1 from a Sphagnum magenllanicum hummock in the Hani mire was about 0.98 cm/y and deposited from 1957-2008 CE, whereas the SR of Core S2 from S. palustre hummock (1 km apart from S1) was 1.59 cm/y and accumulated during 1976-2008. The discrepancy of the SRs may mainly be attributed to the different inorganic material supplies from surface runoff which affected growth of Sphagnum spp. at different sites, with lower rate corresponding to higher inorganic contents (higher Ti, Ca and Mg contents thus lower values of loss on ignition, LOI%). On the other hand, the two cores had similar values and variation trends in the pH, C/N, N and P contents, and dry bulk density (DBD), implying that the organic source and decomposition were similar under the same climatic conditions. The variations of TOC%, C/N and Pb content in the peat cores matched well with the 5-y running average of local annual precipitation record, with higher TOC% and C/N but lower Pb content corresponding to higher rainfall; and vice versa. These properties in the meso-oligotrophic peat sequences can reflect climatic changes. The recent rates of carbon accumulation (RERCA) for S1 and S2 calculated from the TOC%, DBD and SR were averaged 121.6 +/- 24.3 and 175.5 +/- 35.1 g/m(2)/y, respectively.

AB There are fears that global warming will lead to degradation of peatlands, higher emissions of greenhouse gases from peat, and accelerated warming. Anaerobic decomposition of organic soils produces methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. Two peat bogs differing in mean annual temperature, Velke Darko (VD, Czech Republic, 7.2 A degrees C), and Stor myran (SA, Sweden, 4.0 A degrees C), were selected for a comparative study of how organic soils in different climatic zones will respond to warmer and drier conditions. Twenty peat cores from each bog were incubated in growth chambers. Under present-day summer conditions, VD produced 14 times more CH4 than SA. Two different warming scenarios were used. Peat-core replicates were kept at temperatures of 11 versus 16 A degrees C, and 11 versus 22 A degrees C. From 11 to 16 A degrees C, the CH4 production slightly decreased at SA, and slightly increased at VD. From 11 to 22 A degrees C, the CH4 production increased 9 times at SA, but slightly decreased at VD. After an 8-month incubation, peat cores under drying conditions (water table at -14 cm) were compared to samples with original water table (-2 cm). Drying conditions led to a steeper reduction in CH4 production at VD, compared to SA. The CH4 production decreased more than 100 times at VD. Then, the combined effect of simultaneous warming and drying at 11 and 22 A degrees C was studied. We did not find any significant effect of interactions between increasing temperature and decreasing water table level. Overall, the warmer site VD responded more strongly to the simulated climate change than the colder site SA.

AB Beaver dams are known to raise water tables in mineral soil environments, but very little is known about their impact in wetlands, such as peatlands. Peatlands tend to have shallow water tables, and the position and tendency of the water table to fluctuate (i.e., stability) is a factor controlling the system's ability to store carbon and water. Many peatland environments, especially fens, offer ideal habitat for beaver, and the potential for beaver dams to influence this link by manipulating water tables requires investigation. Our objective was to determine the influence of beaver dams on the water table dynamics of a Rocky Mountain fen. We monitored water tables in the peatland for 4years while beaver dams were intact and 2years after they were breached by an extreme flood event. We found that, because of the unique way in which dams were built, they connected the peatland to the stream and raised and stabilized already high water tables within a 150-m radius. Beaver-mediated changes to peatland water table regimes have the potential to enhance carbon sequestration and the peatland's ability to respond to external pressures such as climate change. Furthermore, beaver dams increased surface and groundwater storage, which has implications for regional water balances, especially in times of drought.

AB Modeling risk factors to soils is constrained by the lack of key data and understanding that explicitly and quantitatively link specific threats to risk. Peat erosion results from the complex interaction of climatic, topographic, and anthropogenic influences acting over a long period of time. With numerous contemporary factors operating to perpetuate the erosion processes, it is often difficult to identify with certainty what actually are the initial and subsequent drivers of erosion. In this situation, expert opinion forms a vital source of information. Here we demonstrate how Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) can be used to combine quantitative data from the National Soils Inventory of Scotland (NSIS) with qualitative expert knowledge to estimate risk of peat erosion in Scotland. This model was used to identify the main factors associated with peat erosion. It was shown that climatic variables (increased temperature, decreased precipitation) are the most important risk factors for perpetuating peatland erosion. However, the BBN approach also indicated that maintaining good vegetation cover is a significant mitigating factor. It would follow that land management practices that impact negatively on vegetation cover would also exacerbate peatland erosion given a hot dry climate.

AB The present study makes use of a detailed water balance to investigate the hydrological status of a peatland with a basal clay-rich layer overlying an aquifer exploited for drinking water. The aim is to determine the influence of climate and groundwater extraction on the water balance and water levels in the peatland. During the two-year period of monitoring, the hydrological functioning of the wetland showed a hydric deficit, associated with a permanent unsaturated layer and a deep water table. At the same time, a stream was observed serving as a recharge inflow instead of draining the peatland, as usually described in natural systems. Such conditions are not favourable for peat accumulation. Field investigations show that the clay layer has a high hydraulic conductivity (from 1.10(-7) to 3.10(-9) m.s(-1)) and does not form a hydraulic barrier. Moreover, the vertical hydraulic gradients are downward between the peat and the sand aquifer, leading to high flows of groundwater through the clay layer (20-48% of the precipitation). The observed hydric deficit of the peatland results from a combination of dry climatic conditions during the study period and groundwater extraction. The climatic effect is mainly expressed through drying out of the peatland, while the anthropogenic effect leads to an enhancement of the climatic effect on a global scale, and a modification of fluxes at a local scale. The drying out of the peatland can lead to its mineralisation, which thus gives rise to environmental impacts. The protection of such wetlands in the context of climate change should take account of anthropogenic pressures by considering the wetland-aquifer interaction.

AB Two C-14 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) wiggle-match dated peat sequences from Denmark and northern England record changes in mire Surface wetness reconstructed using plant macrofossil and testate amoebae analyses. A number of significant mid-late Holocene climatic deteriorations (wet shifts) associated with declines in solar activity were recorded (at ca. 2150 cal. yr BC, 740 cal. yr BC, cal. yr AD 930, cal. yr AD 1020, cal. yr AD 1280-1300, cal. yr AD 1640 and cal. yr AD 1790-1830). The wet shifts identified from ca. cal. yr AD 930 are Concurrent with or lag decreases in solar activity by 10-50 years. These changes are replicated by previous records from these and other sites in the region and the new records provide improved precision for the ages of these changes. The rapidly accumulating (LIP to 2-3 yr cm(-1), similar to 1310 yr old, 34 14 C dates) Danish profile offers an unprecedented high-resolution record of climate change from a peat bog, and has effectively recorded a number of significant but short-lived climate change events since ca. cal. yr AD 690. The longer time intervals between samples and the greater length of time resolved by each sample in the British site due to slower peat accumulation rates (up to 11 yr cm(-1), similar to 5250 yr old, 42 14 C dates) acted as a natural smoothing filter preventing the clear registration of some of the rapid climate change events. Not all the significant rises in water table registered in the peat bog archives of the British and Danish sites have been caused by solar forcing, and may be the result of other processes Such as changes in other external forcing factors, the internal variability of the climate system or raised bog ecosystem.

AB Carbon accumulation and storage is a defining characteristic of peatland ecosystems. Decomposition of peat releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to receiving waters and can be an important fraction of the peatland carbon budget, along with being an important modifier of downstream water quality. Changes in temperature and hydrological processes under future climate scenarios are expected to impact decomposition processes in peatlands with unclear ramifications for both the quantity and the quality of the DOC released. We experimentally examined the individual and interactive effects of increased temperature, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and lower water table position on peatland decomposition and the quantity and quality of porewater DOC in intact, replicated peat monoliths in a full factorial design. Decomposition rates and porewater DOC concentrations significantly increased under elevated temperature conditions; however, the quality of this carbon was variable, showing signs of both increased lability and recalcitrance. Lowered water table treatments also increased decomposition rates, although the high water conditions prompted greater porewater DOC concentrations and lability. It is expected that elevated decomposition rates under future climate scenarios will alter porewater DOC quantity in peatlands; however, we suggest that contributions from the aboveground system are needed to fully understand changes in DOC quality and subsequent ecosystem dynamics.

AB Peatland-margin habitats with organic matter accumulation of 40-150 cm make up a significant but poorly quantified portion of Canada's boreal forest region. Spanning the transition between non-wetland forest and fen proper, these ecosystems represent a zone of complex environmental and vegetation change, yet little is known about their ecological function or development. We here use vegetation and macrofossil analysis, traditional C-14, bomb-spike C-14, and Pb-210 dating to investigate the development, organic matter accumulation, and recent vegetation history of peat margin communities at two sites in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Although similar in general shape, bomb-spike C-14 and Pb-210 chronologies show limited agreement in three of the four profiles examined, with Pb-210 generally producing younger ages than C-14. Peat initiation and long-term organic matter accumulation at the Old Black Spruce (OBS) transect were probably driven mainly by the dynamics of Sphagnum, whereas at the Sandhill Fen (SF) transect, they were controlled by water level fluctuations in the neighboring fen. Bryophyte macrofossils suggest a recent drying of the vegetation surface at both sites, most likely triggered by regional drought in the late 1950s and 1960s. At OBS, the shift from Sphagnum- to feather moss-dominated communities continued in the 1990s, possibly reflecting effects of direct disturbance on local drainage patterns. Overall, our results suggest that community composition and C dynamics of peat-margin swamps respond dynamically to climatic and hydrologic fluctuations. However, uncertainties regarding the reliability of different chronologies limit our ability to link observed community changes to specific causal events.

AB [1] Peatlands represent large carbon (C) reservoirs that can act as a source or sink for greenhouse gases. The response of peatland gaseous C fluxes to global climate change and atmospheric sulfate deposition, however, remains uncertain. Methanogenesis is thought to be one of the most important anaerobic C mineralization pathways in peatlands, especially in regions where input of sulfate from acid deposition is low. However, sulfate reduction has been quantified rarely in freshwater wetlands. Here we report greater anaerobic C flow through sulfate reduction than through methanogenesis at all sites situated along a global atmospheric sulfur deposition gradient. Stoichiometric mass balance suggests that fermentation is a dominant anaerobic C mineralization pathway in unpolluted peatlands, while methanogenesis contributed minimally to total anaerobic carbon mineralization in these sites. Furthermore, global increases of atmospheric sulfur deposition minimize the impacts of climatic warming by simultaneously decreasing rates of methanogenesis while causing little change in rates of total anaerobic C mineralization in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands.

AB The Baltic coast of Northern Poland is an interesting region for palaeoclimatic studies because of the mixed oceanic and continental climatic influences and the fact that the dominance of one or the other of these two influences might have changed over time. Also, unlike many more intensively studied regions of Europe, human impact in the region was rather limited until the 19th century. We present a 1200-year high-resolution record from Stazki mire, an ombrotrophic bog located 35 km from the Baltic Sea coast. Using testate amoebae, stable isotopes (delta C-13) of Sphagnum stems, pollen, plant macrofossils and dendroecological analyses, our aims were to: 1) reconstruct the last millennium palaeoenvironment in the study site and its surroundings, 2) identify the major wet-dry shifts, 3) determine if those events correlate with climate change and human impact, 4) assess the resilience of the Baltic bog ecosystem following human impact, and 5) compare the palaeo-moisture signal from the Baltic coast with records from more oceanic regions. Two dry periods are inferred at AD 1100-1500 and 1650-1900 (-2005). The first dry shift is probably climate-driven as pollen record shows little evidence of human indicators. The second dry shift can be related to local peat exploitation of the mire. In the 20th century additional limited drainage took place and since ca. AD 1950 the mire has been recovering. From 1500 AD onwards all proxies indicate wetter condition. The beginning of this wet shift occurred during the Little Ice Age and may therefore be a climatic signal. The macrofossil data show that Sphagnum fuscum dominated the pristine mire vegetation but then declined and finally disappeared at ca. AD 1900. This pattern is comparable with the timing of extinction of Sphagnum austinii (-Sphagnum imbricatum) in the UK. This study illustrates the value of high-resolution multi-proxy studies of peat archives to assess the magnitude of anthropogenic land-use changes. This study presents the first direct comparison of testate amoebae and stable isotope data from the same core. The two proxies correlate significantly throughout the record and most strongly for the latter part of the record when most of the variability was recorded. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Knowledge of past local to regional climate variability is a priority research area as the magnitude of climate change at these scales can be greater than at the global level. Peatlands are sensitive to hydro-climate change and represent a significant carbon (C) pool in the terrestrial biosphere. Here, we applied a multi-proxy approach (bulk density, loss on ignition, total organic carbon, testate amoebae, delta C-13 in Sphagnum, plant macrofossils, pollen and charcoal) and Bayesian statistics to a peat sequence from a mountain ombrogenous bog (Taul Muced) to explore how changes in hydrological conditions, peat plant composition and disturbances have affected long-term physical peat properties and the rate of C accumulation over the last ca. 8800 years. We found that C accumulation at this site ranged from 7 to 105 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (mean 23 +/- 14 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Climatic conditions exerted a direct influence on the peat's plant composition and subsequently affected C accumulation through litter characteristics and abundance, whereas disturbances had a weak effect. Carbon accumulation was greater (31 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) at times of wetter and warmer conditions when Sphagnum was dominant, and lower (17 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) during periods of mixed Sphagnum and vascular plant (mainly sedges) growth under drier/unstable hydrological conditions. Future climate projections of warmer temperatures and greater annual precipitation could therefore positively influence the C sink potential of this peatland. On the other hand, increased anthropogenic pressure in the future may negatively impact the C accumulation. Our study strengthens the geographical coverage of proxy reconstructions of past hydrological variability and highlights the carbon-sink capacity of mountain bogs in a so far understudied region.

AB Peatlands, hydromorphous soils with high organic matter content, display, as a result of anaerobic conditions, a delayed litter decomposition and therefore constitute important terrestric sinks for carbon and nitrogen compounds. In spite of their relatively small area proportion of approx. 3% (3.88-4.38 x 10(6) km(2)), peatlands contain approx. 30% of the world's soil carbon and nitrogen reserves. Several signs indicate that substantial drainage and increasing temperatures due to the increasing cultivation of peatlands and the global climate change could result in a large-scale conversion of peatlands from C/N sinks to C/N sources. Irrespective of many uncertain details and complex interactions with other factors, the lowering of the groundwater table of peatlands actually seems to strongly enhance the net release of the radiatively active trace gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, reducing at the same time the high emissions of methane that occur in natural peatlands. The antizipated climate change will probably induce large-scale shifts in the distribution of the different peatland ecosystems along with considerable changes of the trace gas emissions. In view of this development, a net loss of global peatland area along with an increase in their contribution to the greenhouse effect must be expected.

AB The West Siberian Plain stands out among other boreal plains by phenomenal bogging, which has both global and regional significance. The polygonal bogs, frozen raised-mound bogs, and ombrotrophic ridge-hollow raised bogs are the most extensive bog types in the study area. These bogs commonly show highly diverse surface patterns consisting of mounds, polygons, ridges, hollows, and fens that correspond to the microtopes. Here we investigated how the microtopographic features of the landscape affect the thermal and hydrologic conditions of the soil as well as the nutrient availability and consequently, the dynamics of carbon and related elements. The effect of the surface heterogeneity on the temperature regimes and depths of permafrost is most significant. All of these factors together are reflected, through the feedback system, by a number of hydrochemical parameters of bog waters, such as dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC, DIC), specific conductivity (Cond), SO42-, Cl-, P, Sr, Al, Ti, Cu, V, B, Cs, Cd, Rb, As, U, and rare earth elements (REEs). Among the studied parameters, DOC, SO42-, Al, V, and Mn differ most significantly between the convex and concave microforms. The DOC content in bog water is significantly affected by the water residence time, which is significantly longer in soils of mound/polygons than fens. Plants biomass is higher on the mounds which also have some effect that, due to leaching, should lead to more carbon entering into the water of the mounds. It is also shown that atmospheric-dust particles have a noticeable effect on the hydrochemical parameters of bog waters, especially on mounds. The ongoing climate warming will lead to an increase in the fens area and to a decrease in the content of DOC and many elements in bog waters.

AB Peatlands are permanently flooded wetland ecosystems that accumulate organic matter, which is what makes them carbon sinks and resevoirs. Peatlands that are located in paramos help to maintain water balance in surrounding ecosystems and regulate the distribution of the water used by human communities. Currently, peatlands are affected by climate change, which disrupts the balance between plant production and decomposition. Peatlands dominated by Distichia muscoides are particularly important since they depend on glacial hydrology. This paper presents a climatic reconstruction over the last 200 years, based on the vegetation succession history recorded in core samples from two peatlands located in the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy. The reconstructed vegetation was compared with historical records of temperature and precipitation. Our results showed differences in the trajectories followed by the vegetation, with an increase in plant production and dominance of D. muscoides over the last two decades related to increases in temperature. The positive water balance generated by the global increase in temperature and glacial melting results in an abundance of vascular plants in the turbera. The effect of the El Nino event of 1998 is reflected in a major change in the trajectories of the vegetation at the two sites, with Sphagnum peat being replaced by peat formed from different mosses, limiting the ability of the peatland to store organic matter. The effects of climate change are multiplied by phenomena such as El Nino that can rapidly alter the evolution of an ecosystem, even one as highly resilient as peatlands.

AB Peatlands surrounding Hudson and James Bays form the second largest peatland complex in the world and contain major stores of soil carbon (C). This study utilized a transect of eight ombrotrophic peat cores from remote regions of central and northern Ontario to quantify the magnitude and rate of C accumulation since peatland initiation and for the past 2000 calendar years before present (2 ka). These new data were supplemented by 17 millennially resolved chronologies from a literature review covering the Boreal Shield, Hudson Plains, and Taiga Shield bordering Hudson and James Bays. Peatlands initiated in central and northern Ontario by 7.8 ka following deglaciation and isostatic emergence of northern areas to above sea level. Total C accumulated since inception averaged 109.7 +/- (std. dev.) 36.2 kg C m(-2). Approximately 40% of total. soil C has accumulated since 2 ka at an average apparent rate of 20.2 +/- 6.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The 2 ka depths correlate significantly and positively with modern gridded climate estimates for mean annual precipitation, mean annual air temperature, growing degree-days > 0 degrees C, and photosynthetically active radiation integrated over days > 0 degrees C. There are significantly shallower depths in permafrost peatlands. Vertical peat accumulation was likely constrained by temperature, growing season length, and photosynthetically active radiation over the last 2 ka in the Hudson Bay Lowlands and surrounding regions.

AB Peatlands are a large potential source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. In order to investigate the effects of climate change on CH4 emission from northern ombrotrophic peatlands, a simulation model coupling water table dynamics with methane emission was developed for the Mer Bleue Bog in Ontario, Canada. The model was validated against reported values of CH4 flux from field measurements and the model outputs exhibited high sensitivity to acrotelm thickness, leaf area index, transmissivity and slope of water table. With a 2-4A degrees C temperature rise over the 4-year simulation period, the rate of CH4 release dropped significantly to under 0.1 mg m(-2) day(-1). On the other hand, mean CH4 emission increased by > 26-fold when the increase in precipitation was > 15%. When looking at the combined effects, the highest CH4 release (13.3 mg m(-2) day(-1)) was attained under the scenario of 2A degrees C temperature rise and 25% precipitation increase. Results obtained in this study highlight the importance of avoiding more extreme climate change, which would otherwise lead to enhanced methane release from peatlands and further atmospheric warming through positive feedback.

AB Permafrost peatlands store globally significant amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) that may be vulnerable to climate change. Permafrost thaw exposes deeper, older SOC to microbial activity, but SOC vulnerability to mineralization and release as carbon dioxide is likely influenced by the soil environmental conditions that follow thaw. Permafrost thaw in peat plateaus, the dominant type of permafrost peatlands in North America, occurs both through deepening of the active layer and through thermokarst. Active layer deepening exposes aged SOC to predominately oxic conditions, while thermokarst is associated with complete permafrost thaw which leads to ground subsidence, inundation and soil anoxic conditions. Thermokarst often follows active layer deepening, and wildfire is an important trigger of this sequence. We compared the mineralization rate of aged SOC at an intact peat plateau (similar to 70 cm oxic active layer), a burned peat plateau (similar to 120 cm oxic active layer), and a thermokarst bog (similar to 550 cm anoxic peat profile) by measuring respired C-14-CO2. Measurements were done in fall when surface temperatures were near-freezing while deeper soil temperatures were still close to their seasonal maxima. Aged SOC (1600 yrs BP) contributed 22.1 +/- 11.3% and 3.5 +/- 3.1% to soil respiration in the burned and intact peat plateau, respectively, indicating a fivefold higher rate of aged SOC mineralization in the burned than intact peat plateau (0.15 +/- 0.07 versus 0.03 +/- 0.03 gCO(2)-Cm-2 d(-1)). None or minimal contribution of aged SOC to soil respiration was detected within the thermokarst bog, regardless of whether thaw had occurred decades or centuries ago. While more data from other sites and seasons are required, our study provides strong evidence of substantially increased respiration of aged SOC from burned peat plateaus with deepened active layer, while also suggesting inhibition of aged SOC respiration under anoxic conditions in thermokarst bogs.

AB Mountain fens are limited in their spatial extent but are vital ecosystems for biodiversity, habitat, and carbon and water cycling. Studies of fen hydrological function in northern regions indicate the timing and magnitude of runoff is variable, with atmospheric and environmental conditions playing key roles in runoff production. How the complex ecohydrological processes of mountain fens that govern water storage and release as well as peat accumulation will respond to a warmer and less snowy future climate is unclear. To provide insight, we studied the hydrological processes and function of Sibbald fen, located at the low end of the known elevation range in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, over a dry period. We added an evapotranspiration function to the Spence hydrological function method to better account for storage loss. When frozen in spring and early summer, the fen primarily transmits water. When thawed, the fen's hydrological function switches from water transmission to water release, leading to a summertime water table decline of nearly 1 m. Rainfall events larger than 5 mm can transiently switch fen hydrological function to storage, followed by contribution, depending on antecedent conditions. The evapotranspiration function was dominant only for a brief period in late June and early July when rainfall was low and the ground was still partially frozen, even though evapotranspiration accounted for the largest loss of storage from the system. This research highlights the mechanisms by which mountain peatlands supply baseflow during drought conditions, and the importance of frozen ground and rainfall in regulating their hydrological function. The study has important implications for the sustainability of low elevation mountain fens under climate change.

AB Globally, considerable carbon (C) is stored in soils, particularly in peatlands. These stores play a potentially significant role in atmospheric C-cycle feedbacks, and thus need to be accounted for in global models. However, present global soil models do not accurately represent peat C-stocks and -dynamics; thus, their climate-soil C feedback predictions are questionable. A major shortcoming of current models that are based on the decomposition of soil C pools is the lack of representation of long-term (non-equilibrium) soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, as peat cohorts, with cohort age information. Whereas C-pool models are commonly 'spun up' to equilibrium over several hundred years using an average climate, in nature, soils actually evolve over many thousands of years with associated changes in litter amounts and quality, which affect SOC accumulation, and hence peat formation. Secondly, peat soils have a unique hydrology, and changes in the water table depth (WTD) of peat are important in regulating SOC turnover, yet current non-cohort C pool models fail to include such dynamic hydrological processes. We have developed an improved peat age-cohort model called MILLENNIA, with a variable WTD driving C-dynamics during Holocene peat accumulation, allowing validation with peat age data and the testing of a realistic WTD-driven peat SOC stock response to climate-change scenarios. Model C-dynamics showed particular sensitivity to water table dynamics through precipitation and runoff, as well as to litter quality and decomposition rates. We show that predicted SOC accumulation and peat ages compare well with observations from a UK peatland site, which is currently (on average) a weak net C source with strong climate sensitivity.

AB Large-scale changes in climate may have unexpected effects on ecosystems, given the importance of climate as a control over almost all ecosystem attributes and internal feedbacks. Changes in plant community productivity or composition, for example, may alter ecosystem resource dynamics, trophic structures, or disturbance regimes, with subsequent positive or negative feedbacks on the plant community. At northern latitudes, where increases in temperature are expected to be greatest but where plant species diversity is relatively low, climatically mediated changes in species composition or abundance will likely have large ecosystem effects. In this study, we investigated effects of infrared loading and manipulations of water-table elevation on net primary productivity of plant species in bog and fen wetland mesocosms between 1994 and 1997.
   We removed 27 intact soil monoliths (2.1 m(2) surface area, 0.5-0.7 m depth) each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water-table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Overhead infrared lamps caused mean monthly soil temperatures to increase by 1.6-4.1 degreesC at 15-cm depth during the growing season (May-October). In 1996, depths to water table averaged -11, -19, and -26 cm in the bog plots, and 0, -10, and -19 cm in the fen plots.
   Annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of bryophyte, forb, graminoid, and shrub life-forms was determined for the dominant species in the mesocosm plots based on species specific canopy/biomass relationships. Belowground net primary production (BNPP) was estimated using root in-growth cores.
   Bog and fen communities differed in their response to infrared loading and water-table treatments because of the differential response of life-forms and species characteristic of each community. Along a gradient of increasing water-table elevation, production of bryophytes increased, and production of shrubs decreased in the bog community. Along a similar gradient in the fen community, production of graminoids and forbs increased. Along a gradient of in creasing infrared loading in the bog, shrub production increased whereas graminoid production decreased. In the fen, graminoids were most productive at high infrared loading, and forbs were most productive at medium infrared loading. In the bog and fen, BNPP:ANPP ratios increased with warming and drying, indicating shifts in carbon allocation in response to climate change.
   Further, opposing responses of species and life-forms tended to cancel out the response of production at higher levels of organization, especially in the bog. For example, total net primary productivity in the bog did not differ between water-table treatments because BNPP was greatest in the dry treatment whereas ANPP was greatest in the wet treatment.
   The differential responses of species, life-forms, and above- and belowground biomass production to the treatments suggest that bog and fen plant communities will change, in different directions and magnitudes, in response to warming and changes in water-table elevation. Further, results of this and complementary research indicate that these peatlands may mediate their energy, carbon, and nutrient budgets through differential responses of the plant communities. Thus, predictions of the response of peatlands to changes in climate should consider differences in plant community structure, as well as biogeochemistry and hydrology, that characterize and differentiate these two ecosystems.

AB Several studies on the impact of climate warming have indicated that peat decomposition/mineralization will be enhanced. Most of these studies deal with the impact of experimental warming during summer when prevalent abiotic conditions are favorable to decomposition. Here, we investigated the effect of experimental air warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) on water-extractable organic matter (WEOM), microbial biomasses and enzymatic activities in two contrasted moisture sites named Bog and Fen sites, the latter considered as the wetter ones. While no or few changes in peat temperature and water content appeared under the overall effect of OTCs, we observed that air warming smoothed water content differences and led to a decrease in mean peat temperature at the warmed Bog sites. This thermal discrepancy between the two sites led to contrasting changes in microbial structure and activities: a rise in hydrolytic activity at the warmed Bog sites and a relative enhancement of bacterial biomass at the warmed Fen sites. These features were not associated with any change in WEOM properties namely carbon and sugar contents and aromaticity, suggesting that air warming did not trigger any shift in OM decomposition. Using various tools, we show that the use of single indicators of OM decomposition can lead to fallacious conclusions.
   Lastly, these patterns may change seasonally as a consequence of complex interactions between groundwater level and air warming, suggesting the need to improve our knowledge using a high time-resolution approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Predictive understanding of northern peatland hydrology is a necessary precursor to understanding the fate of massive carbon stores in these systems under the influence of present and future climate change. Current models have begun to address microtopographic controls on peatland hydrology, but none have included a prognostic calculation of peatland water table depth for a vegetated wetland, independent of prescribed regional water tables. We introduce here a new configuration of the Community Land Model (CLM) which includes a fully prognostic water table calculation for a vegetated peatland. Our structural and process changes to CLM focus on modifications needed to represent the hydrologic cycle of bogs environment with perched water tables, as well as distinct hydrologic dynamics and vegetation communities of the raised hummock and sunken hollow microtopography characteristic of peatland bogs. The modified model was parameterized and independently evaluated against observations from an ombrotrophic raised-dome bog in northern Minnesota (S1-Bog), the site for the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change experiment (SPRUCE). Simulated water table levels compared well with site-level observations. The new model predicts hydrologic changes in response to planned warming at the SPRUCE site. At present, standing water is commonly observed in bog hollows after large rainfall events during the growing season, but simulations suggest a sharp decrease in water table levels due to increased evapotranspiration under the most extreme warming level, nearly eliminating the occurrence of standing water in the growing season. Simulated soil energy balance was strongly influenced by reduced winter snowpack under warming simulations, with the warming influence on soil temperature partly offset by the loss of insulating snowpack in early and late winter. The new model provides improved predictive capacity for seasonal hydrological dynamics in northern peatlands, and provides a useful foundation for investigation of northern peatland carbon exchange.

AB Climate change studies foresee substantial changes in precipitation patterns in northern temperate regions, including an increased frequency of drought and intense rain events. To elucidate the impact of drying and rewetting on redox processes in peatlands we conducted a field scale manipulation experiment, tracing the below ground dynamics of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane (CH4), and electron acceptors in a minerotrophic fen. On three treatment plots, a drought phase of similar to 4 weeks was initiated by means of a drainage system and a mountable roof. Subsequently we simulated a heavy rainfall by irrigation, which raised the water table by 20-35 cm. Three plots served as control. Solute electron acceptor concentrations increased during drought and decreased after rewetting, consistent with treatment and weather. Changes in solid phase electron acceptor contents were not detected. Drought induced aeration regenerated electron acceptors and suppressed methanogenic activity. This suppressive effect persisted during and some 1-4weeks after rewetting, dependent on depth. Hydrogen- and acetate-dependent iron and sulfate reduction were thermodynamically viable processes in the peat as their energy gain exceeded the threshold for microbial metabolism of -23 kJ mol(-1). Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was apparently thermodynamically inhibited in most of the peat, but proceeded presumably in microenvironments. In the uppermost peat layers, partly above the water table level, iron and sulfate reduction and occasionally methanogenesis overlapped and aeration was limited. Thus, in these layers reductive processes could partly proceed even during drought As all processes, including methanogenesis, responded quickly to wetting events, the microbial community seemed to be well adapted to fluctuating redox conditions. This study demonstrated that the dense and highly decomposed material could still provide anaerobic habitats for microorganisms during drought and the depth distribution of redox processes was quite insensitive towards the water table manipulations, presumably due to formation of microenvironments.

AB Permafrost thaw resulting from climate warming may dramatically change the succession and carbon dynamics of northern ecosystems. To examine the joint effects of regional temperature and local species changes on peat accumulation following thaw, we studied peat accumulation across a regional gradient of mean annual temperature (MAT). We measured aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and decomposition over 2 years for major functional groups and used these data to calculate a simple index of net annual aboveground peat accumulation. In addition, we collected cores from six adjacent frozen and thawed bog sites to document peat accumulation changes following thaw over the past 200 years. Aboveground biomass and decomposition were more strongly controlled by local succession than regional climate. AGNPP for some species differed between collapse scars and associated permafrost plateaus and was influenced by regional MAT. A few species, such as Picea mariana trees on frozen bogs and Sphagnum mosses in thawed bogs, sequestered a disproportionate amount of peat; in addition, changes in their abundance following thaw changed peat accumulation. Pb-210-dated cores indicated that peat accumulation doubles following thaw and that the accumulation rate is affected by historical changes in species during succession. Peat accumulation in boreal peatlands following thaw was controlled by a complex mix of local vegetation changes, regional climate, and history. These results suggest that northern ecosystems may show responses more complex than large releases of carbon during transient warming.

AB Northern peatlands store globally significant amounts of soil carbon that could be released to the atmosphere under drier conditions induced by climate change. We measured forest floor respiration (R-FF) at hummocks and hollows in a treed boreal bog in Alberta, Canada and partitioned the flux into aboveground forest floor autotrophic, belowground forest floor autotrophic, belowground tree respiration, and heterotrophic respiration using a series of clipping and trenching experiments. These fluxes were compared to those measured at sites within the same bog where water-table (WT) was drawn down for 2 and 12 years. Experimental WT drawdown significantly increased R-FF with greater increases at hummocks than hollows. Greater R-FF was largely driven by increased autotrophic respiration driven by increased growth of trees and shrubs in response to drier conditions; heterotrophic respiration accounted for a declining proportion of R-FF with time since drainage. Heterotrophic respiration was increased at hollows, suggesting that soil carbon may be lost from these sites in response to climate change induced drying. Overall, although WT drawdown increased R-FF, the substantial contribution of autotrophic respiration to R-FF suggests that peat carbon stocks are unlikely to be rapidly destabilized by drying conditions.

AB Northern peatlands constitute a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4). However, management of undisturbed peatlands, as well as the restoration of disturbed peatlands, will alter the exchange of CH4 with the atmosphere. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to collate and analyze published studies to improve our understanding of the factors that control CH4 emissions and the impacts of management on the gas flux from northern (latitude 40 degrees to 70 degrees N) peatlands. The analysis includes a total of 87 studies reporting measurements of CH4 emissions taken at 186 sites covering different countries, peatland types, and management systems. Results show that CH4 emissions from natural northern peatlands are highly variable with a 95% CI of 7.6-15.7 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the mean and 3.3-6.3 g C m(-2) year(-1) for the median. The overall annual average (mean +/- SD) is 12 +/- 21 g C m(-2) year(-1) with the highest emissions from fen ecosystems. Methane emissions from natural peatlands are mainly controlled by water table (WT) depth, plant community composition, and soil pH. Although mean annual air temperature is not a good predictor of CH4 emissions by itself, the interaction between temperature, plant community cover, WT depth, and soil pH is important. According to short-term forecasts of climate change, these complex interactions will be the main determinant of CH4 emissions from northern peatlands. Drainage significantly (p < .05) reduces CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, on average by 84%. Restoration of drained peatlands by rewetting or vegetation/rewetting increases CH4 emissions on average by 46% compared to the original premanagement CH4 fluxes. However, to fully evaluate the net effect of management practice on the greenhouse gas balance from high latitude peatlands, both net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and carbon exports need to be considered.

AB In order to understand the carbon fate of alpine peatlands under climate change, this study aimed to measure carbon accumulation in recent decades and that during the Holocene at seven representative peat sites on the Zoige Plateau using empirical peat core data (C-14 and C-137(s)) and modeling approaches. The observed apparent carbon accumulation rate over the past 50 years was 75 (35-123) g C m(-2) yr(-1), nearly four times that of 19 (7-30) g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the whole Holocene. With decomposition history included in consideration by using modeling approaches, the average expected peat carbon accumulation rate was still nearly 1.6 times that of the modeled net carbon uptake rate of peats accumulated over the whole Holocene, though exceptions were found for Denahequ and Hongyuan peat cores with extremely low water table levels. The newly accumulated peat carbon of the Zoige Plateau amounted to 0.4 Tg C yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12) g) during recent decades. Overall, the effect of climate warming on recent C accumulation of peatlands on the Zoige Plateau is dependent on their water conditions. The peat C storage on the alpine Plateau is threatened by human activities (drainage) and continuous climate change with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation which cause dryness of peatlands.

AB Stress factors such as climate change and drought may switch the role of temperate peatlands from carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks to sources, leading to positive feedback to global climate change. Water level management has been regarded as an important climate change mitigation strategy as it can sustain the natural net CO2 sink function of a peatland. Little is known about how resilient peatlands are in the face of future climate change scenarios, as well as how effectively water level management can sustain the CO2 sink function to mitigate global warming. The authors assess the effect of climate change on CO2 exchange of south Swedish temperate peatlands, which were either unmanaged or subject to water level regulation. Climate chamber simulations were conducted using experimental peatland mesocosms exposed to current and future representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5). The results showed that all managed and unmanaged systems under future climate scenarios could serve as CO2 sinks throughout the experimental period. However, the 2018 extreme drought caused the unmanaged mesocosms under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 switch from a net CO2 sink to a source during summer. Surprisingly, the unmanaged mesocosms under RCP 2.6 benefited from the warmer climate, and served as the best sink among the other unmanaged systems. Water level management had the greatest effect on the CO2 sink function under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, which improved their CO2 sink capability up to six and two times, respectively. Under the current climate scenario, water level management had a negative effect on the CO2 sink function, and it had almost no effect under RCP 2.6. Therefore, the researchers conclude that water level management is necessary for RCP 8.5, beneficial for RCP 4.5 and unimportant for RCP 2.6 and the current climate.

AB Worldwide, regularly recurring wildfires shape many peatland ecosystems to the extent that fire-adapted species often dominate plant communities, suggesting that wildfire is an integral part of peatland ecology rather than an anomaly. The most destructive blazes are smoldering fires that are usually initiated in periods of drought and can combust entire peatland carbon stores. However, peatland wildfires more typically occur as low-severity surface burns that arise in the dormant season when vegetation is desiccated, and soil moisture is high. In such low-severity fires, surface layers experience flash heating, but there is little loss of underlying peat to combustion. This study examines the potential importance of such processes in several peatlands that span a gradient from hemiboreal to tropical ecozones and experience a wide range of fire return intervals. We show that low-severity fires can increase the pool of stable soil carbon by thermally altering the chemistry of soil organic matter (SOM), thereby reducing rates of microbial respiration. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared, we demonstrate that low-severity fires significantly increase the degree of carbon condensation and aromatization of SOM functional groups, particularly on the surface of peat aggregates. Laboratory incubations show lower CO2 emissions from peat subjected to low-severity fire and predict lower cumulative CO2 emissions from burned peat after 1-3 years. Also, low-severity fires reduce the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of peat, indicating that these fires can inhibit microbial access to SOM. The increased stability of thermally altered SOM may allow a greater proportion of organic matter to survive vertical migration into saturated and anaerobic zones of peatlands where environmental conditions physiochemically protect carbon stores from decomposition for thousands of years. Thus, across latitudes, low-severity fire is an overlooked factor influencing carbon cycling in peatlands, which is relevant to global carbon budgets as climate change alters fire regimes worldwide.

AB Hydrological monitoring in an eroded South Pennine peatland shows that persistent and frequent water table drawdowns occur at gully edge locations, defining a deeper and thicker acrotelm than is observed in intact peatlands (an erosional acrotelm). Antecedent water table elevation is a key control on the hydrological response to precipitation events, in particular runoff percent, the timing of peak discharges and maximum water table elevations. Significant discharge is generated whilst water table elevations are relatively tow at gully edge locations, and this has a strong influence on flow pathways. Four characteristics of runoff response are recognised: (i) the rapid development of macropore/pipe flow at the start of the storm; (ii) peat rewetting, water table elevation increase and continued macropore/pipe flow; (iii) maximum water table elevations and peak stream discharge with throughflow occurring within the erosional acrotelm and rapid flow through the subsurface macropore/pipe network; (iv) rapidly declining water table elevations and stream flow following the cessation of rainfall. Gully edge peats provide a key linkage between the hillslope hydrological system and channel flow so that their influence on the hydrological functioning of the peatlands is disproportionate to their aerial. extent within the catchment. Future climate change may lead to further degradation of the bogs and a reinforcement of the importance of erosion gullies to runoff generation and water quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB On patterned peatlands, open water pools develop within a matrix of terrestrial vegetation ('ridges'). Regional patterns in the distribution of ridge-pool complexes suggest that the relative cover of these two surface types is controlled in part by climate wetness, but landscape topography must also be an important controlling factor. In this paper, a functional model that relates relative cover of ridges and pools to climate and surface gradient was developed and tested. The model was formulated in terms of a water budget, based on the differential effects of ridges and pools on losses by evapotranspiration and subsurface flow. It predicts a positive relationship between surface gradient and ridge proportion, with a linear effect related to water supply and ridge hydraulic conductivity, modified at high ridge proportion by differences in evapotranspiration between ridges and pools. The limit to patterned peatland distribution occurs where the surface is completely covered by ridges. The model may be sensitive or insensitive to climate differences between localities, depending on whether hydraulic characteristics of ridge peat co-vary with water supply. To distinguish between these alternative hypotheses, surface gradient and ridge proportion were surveyed along 20 transects in each of three localities in Scotland that differ threefold in net precipitation to pools. The results of the field survey served to reject the climate-sensitive hypothesis, but were consistent with the climate-insensitive hypothesis. Analysis of the residuals suggested that variation within localities was related more to topographic control of water supply than to ridge hydraulic conductivity or developmental stage. Hence, within this maritime climate region, the distribution of ridge-pool complexes and the relative abundance of pools are controlled mainly by topographic variables. Field surveys across both maritime and continental regions are required to confirm a subtle climatic effect that allows pools to occur on higher gradients in drier climates than in wetter climates. Further development and testing of the functional model will provide a stronger basis for assessing potential feedback between climate change, peatland surface structure and methane emission from pools.

AB Understanding the ecohydrological responses of peatlands to climate change is particularly challenging over the late Holocene owing to the confounding influence of anthropogenic activity. To address this, a core spanning the last similar to 2400 years from a raised bog in northern England was analysed using a comprehensive suite of proxy methods in an attempt to elucidate the drivers of change. A testate amoebae-based transfer function was used to quantitatively reconstruct changes in water table depth, supported by humification analysis and a plant macrofossil-derived hydroclimatic index. Pollen and plant macrofossil data were used to examine regional and local vegetation change, and human impacts were inferred from charcoal and geochemistry. Chronological control was achieved through a Bayesian age-depth model based on AMS radiocarbon dates and spheroidal carbonaceous particles, from which peat and carbon accumulation rates were calculated. Phases of both increased and decreased bog surface wetness (inferred effective precipitation) are present, with dry phases at c. AD 320-830, AD 920-1190 and AD 1850 present, and a marked period of increased effective precipitation at c. AD 1460-1850. Coherence with other records from across Northern Europe suggests that these episodes are primarily driven by allogenic climatic change. Periods of high bog surface wetness correspond to the Wolf, Sporer and Maunder sunspot activity minima, suggesting solar forcing was a significant driver of climate change over the last similar to 1000 years. Following the intensification of agriculture and industry over the last two centuries, the combined climatic and anthropogenic forcing effects become increasingly difficult to separate due to increases in atmospheric deposition of anthropogenically derived pollutants, fertilising compounds, and additions of wind-blown soil dust. We illustrate the need for multiproxy approaches based on high-resolution palaeoecology and geochemistry to examine the recent trajectories of peatlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The calcareous substrate of spring-fed fens makes them unique islands of biodiversity, hosting endangered, vulnerable, and protected vascular plants. Hence, spring-fed fens ecosystems require special conservation attention because many of them are destroyed (e.g. drained, forested) and it is extremely difficult or even impossible to restore the unique hydrogeological and geochemical conditions enabling their function. The longterm perspective of paleoecological studies allows indication of former wetland ecosystem states and provides understanding of their development over millennia. To examine the late Holocene dynamics of a calcareous spring-fed fen (Raganu Mire) ecosystem on the Baltic Sea coast (Latvia) in relation to environmental changes, substrate and human activity, we have undertaken high-resolution analyses of plant macrofossils, pollen, mollusc, stable carbon (813C) and oxygen (818O) isotopes combined with radiocarbon dating (AMS) in three coring locations. Our study revealed that peat deposits began accumulating ca. 7000 cal. yr BP and calcareous deposits (tufa) from 1450 cal. yr BP, coinciding with regional hydrological changes. Several fire events occurred between 4000 and 1600 cal. yr BP, which appeared to have had a limited effect on local vegetation. The most significant changes in the forest and peatland ecosystems were at 3200 cal. yr BP associated with a dry climate stage and high fire activity, and then between 1400 and 500 cal. yr BP potentially associated with temperature changes during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age. Hydrological disturbances in the peatland catchment from 1400 cal. yr BP were most likely strengthened by human activity (deforestation) in this region. The relationship between the development of this peatland and changes in its catchment area, such as land cover changes or fluctuations in groundwater levels, suggest that protection and restoration of spring-fed fen ecosystems should also include the surrounding catchment. The presence of calcareous sediments, as well as appropriate temperature and local hydrological conditions appear to be the most crucial factors controlling Cladium marisus populations in our site - currently at the eastern limit of its distribution in Europe.

AB Temperature sensitivities of microbial respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production were investigated by using a novel method, thermal gradient (2-20A degrees C) temperature bar, in two typical peatlands (bog and fen) in North Wales, UK over 12 months. The study indicated that temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon decomposition in North peatlands was regulated not only by temperature but soil water content, dry-rewet event and phenologies. Potential decreases of Q(10) (CO2) with increasing soil temperature were confirmed in both peatlands, but Q(10) (DOC) increase with increasing soil temperature in both bog and fen sites. These results imply, if other factors such as the so-called CO2 fertilization effect are simultaneously taken into account, that the feedback of global warming induced CO2 release from peatlands to climate change may be overestimated in current biogeochemical models. However, global warming might have been nonlinearly accelerating DOC thermal production, and therefore it helps explaining the causes of remarkable increase of DOC in surface water in the Northern Hemisphere during last several decades.

TI Assessing DOC export from a Sphagnum-dominated peatland using delta C-13

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) originating in peatlands can be mineralized to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), two potent greenhouse gases. Knowledge of the dynamics of DOC export via run-off is needed for a more robust quantification of C cycling in peatland ecosystems, a prerequisite for realistic predictions of future climate change. We studied dispersion pathways of DOC in a mountain-top peat bog in the Czech Republic (Central Europe), using a dual isotope approach. Although delta C-13(DOC) values made it possible to link exported DOC with its within-bog source, delta O-18(H2O) values of precipitation and run-off helped to understand run-off generation. Our 2-year DOC-H2O isotope monitoring was complemented by a laboratory peat incubation study generating an experimental time series of delta C-13(DOC) values. DOC concentrations in run-off during high-flow periods were 20-30 mg L-1. The top 2 cm of the peat profile, composed of decaying green moss, contained isotopically lighter C than deeper peat, and this isotopically light C was present in run-off in high-flow periods. In contrast, baseflow contained only 2-10 mg DOC L-1, and its more variable C isotope composition intermittently fingerprinted deeper peat. DOC in run-off occasionally contained isotopically extremely light C whose source in solid peat substrate was not identified. Pre-event water made up on average 60% of the water run-off flux, whereas direct precipitation contributed 40%. Run-off response to precipitation was relatively fast. A highly leached horizon was identified in shallow catotelm. This peat layer was likely affected by a lateral influx of precipitation. Within 36 days of laboratory incubation, isotopically heavy DOC that had been initially released from the peat was replaced by isotopically lighter DOC, whose delta C-13 values converged to the solid substrate and natural run-off. We suggest that delta C-13 systematics can be useful in identification of vertically stratified within-bog DOC sources for peatland run-off.

TI Carbon Dioxide and Methane Flux Response and Recovery From Drought in a

SO FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE

AB Globally peatlands store 500 Gt carbon (C), with northern blanket bogs accumulating 23 g C m(-2) y(-1) due to cool wet conditions. As a sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) peat bogs slow anthropogenic climate change, but warming climate increases the likelihood of drought which may reduce net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and increase soil respiration, tipping C sinks to sources. High water tables make bogs a globally important source of methane (CH4), another greenhouse gas (GHG) with a global warming potential (GWP) 34 times that of CO2. Warming may increase CH4 emissions, but drying may cause a reduction. Predicted species composition changes may also influence GHG balance, due to different traits such as erenchyma, e.g., Eriophorum vaginatum (eriophorum) and non-aerenchymatous species, e.g., Calluna vulgaris (heather). To understand how these ecosystems will respond to climate change, it is vital to measure GHG responses to drought at the species level. An automated chamber system, SkyLine2D, measured NEE and CH4 fluxes near-continuously from an ombrotrophic fen from August 2017 to September 2019. Four ecotypes were identified: sphagnum (Sphagnum spp), eriophorum, heather and water, hypothesizing that fluxes would significantly differ between ecotypes. The 2018 drought allowed comparison of fluxes between drought and non-drought years (May to September), and their recovery the following year. Methane emissions differed between ecotypes (p < 0.02), ordered high to low: eriophorum > sphagnum > water > heather, ranging from 23 to 8 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1). Daily NEE was similar between ecotypes (p > 0.7), but under 2018 drought conditions all ecotypes were greater sources of CO2 compared to 2019, losing 1.14 g and 0.24 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) respectively (p < 0.001). CH4 emissions were ca. 40% higher during 2018 than 2019, 17 mg compared to 12 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) (p < 0.0001), and fluxes exhibited hysteresis with water table depth. A lag of 84-88 days was observed between rising water table and increased CH4 emissions. A significant interaction between ecotype and year showed fluxes from open water did not return to pre-drought levels. Our findings suggest that short-term drought may lead to a net increase in C emissions from northern wetlands.

AB This study aimed to obtain carbon fluxes in the Zoige peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in the contemporary (recent years) and modern era (recent decades) and ancient times (during the Holocene or even longer) using flux tower and modeling approaches. The goal was to understand the carbon fate of alpine peatlands under climate change. Time-weighted average net carbon balance (g C m(-2) yr(-1)) of Zoige peatlands was 189.3 +/- 33.0 in the contemporary era, 80.6 +/- 13.5 in the modern era and 33.5 +/- 5.5 during the Holocene. Historical net carbon balance on these peatlands showed a ladder pattern. The observed carbon accumulation rate was 117.2 +/- 14.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the past 50 years and 94.3 +/- 12.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the past 100 years, which were nearly three times the rate of 36.6 +/- 4.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the long term, even though they had spatial discrepancy due to limited data. Our results indicated variable climatic factors may influence net carbon balance to some extent, and the primary determinant was temperature in the contemporary era, water table in the modern era and temperature in the Holocene, probably.

AB Climate change has the capacity to alter physical and biological ecosystem processes, jeopardizing the survival of associated species. This is a particular concern in cool, wet northern peatlands that could experience warmer, drier conditions. Here we show that climate, ecosystem processes and food chains combine to influence the population performance of species in British blanket bogs. Our peatland process model accurately predicts water-table depth, which predicts abundance of craneflies (keystone invertebrates), which in turn predicts observed abundances and population persistence of three ecosystem-specialist bird species that feed on craneflies during the breeding season. Climate change projections suggest that falling water tables could cause 56-81% declines in cranefly abundance and, hence, 15-51% reductions in the abundances of these birds by 2051-2080. We conclude that physical (precipitation, temperature and topography), biophysical (evapotranspiration and desiccation of invertebrates) and ecological (food chains) processes combine to determine the distributions and survival of ecosystem-specialist predators.

AB Ecosystems around the world are being subjected to numerous human disturbances. Climate change and land degradation are the most obvious of these disturbances and have received much attention. However, easily overlooked, indirect disturbances can also alter ecosystem structure and function. Dust deposition is a prime example of an easily overlooked disturbance process. We hypothesized that historic European settlement and land-clearance in eastern North America led to widespread wind erosion of upland soils and subsequent dust deposition onto otherwise undisturbed peatlands, potentially fertilizing these naturally nutrient-poor ecosystems and causing shifts in plant communities. We tested these hypotheses by analyzing 11 peat profiles collected across a broad region of eastern North America. We documented a strong correlation between the concentrations of Ambrosia pollen grains and microscopic mineral particles, interpreting this as a signal of dust deposition coincident with European settlement and land-clearance. Analysis of Sphagnum macrofossils revealed substantial site-to-site variability in both the degree and the direction of ecological response to dust deposition, but suggested that increasing magnitude of dust deposition increased the likelihood of a decline in the relative abundance of Sphagnum. Results also suggested that raised bogs were more sensitive to dust deposition than kettle peatlands. We conclude that European settlement and land-clearance resulted in widespread dust deposition on peatlands, leading to ecological changes in some of these ecosystems, and leaving behind a coherent dust horizon in the late-Holocene peatland stratigraphy of eastern North America. This easily overlooked indirect disturbance process could be ongoing today in areas of widespread soil disturbance and could potentially further alter dust-receiving ecosystems.

AB QuestionA better understanding of the response of Sphagnum mosses and associated vascular plants to climate warming is relevant for predicting the carbon balance of peatlands in a warmer world. Open-top chambers (OTCs) have been used to investigate the effect on soil biogeochemical processes in peatlands, but little information is available on the effects of OTCs on microclimate conditions and the associated response of the plant community. We aimed to understand how simulated warming and differences in soil moisture affect plant species cover.
   LocationA Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in French Jura.
   MethodsWe used OTCs to measure the effect of a near-ground temperature increase (+1.5 degrees C on average) on vegetation dynamics over five growing seasons (2008-2012) in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland, in two adjacent microhabitats with different hydrological conditions - wet and dry. Microclimatic conditions and plant species abundance were monitored at peak biomass in years 1, 2, 3 and 5 and monthly during the plant growing season in year 5.
   ResultsThe response to warming differed between vascular plants and bryophytes, as well as among species within these groups, and also varied in relation to soil moisture. Andromeda polifolia abundance responded positively to warming, while Vaccinium oxycoccus responded negatively, and Eriophorum vaginatum showed a high resistance.
   ConclusionDepth of rooting of vascular plants appeared to control the response in plant abundance, while moss abundance depended on various other interacting factors, such as shading by the vascular plant community, precipitation and soil moisture.

AB Large tracts of arctic and subarctic peatlands are underlain by permafrost. These peatlands store large quantities of carbon (C), and are currently under severe threat from climate change. The aim of this study was to determine the size and organic chemistry of the easily degradable C pool in permafrost peatlands and link the functional organic chemistry to temperature and moisture controls of greenhouse gas emissions. First, we used a combination of field measurements and laboratory experiments to assess the influence of increased temperature and flooding on CO2 and CH4 emissions from sixteen permafrost peatlands in subarctic Sweden and Canada. Second, we determined the variation in organic matter chemistry and the associated microbial community composition of the peat active layer, with depth using quantitative C-13 solid-state NMR and molecular biomarkers respectively. We demonstrate that the peat organic chemistry strongly controls CO2 release from peat and that ca. 35 and 26% of the peat organic matter, at the Swedish and Canadian peatlands sites, respectively, is easily degradable by heterotrophic microorganisms. In contrast to CO2, CH4 emissions were decoupled from peat functional organic chemistry. We show a strong relationship between the microbial community structure and the peat organic chemistry suggesting that substrate type and abundance is an important driver of microbial composition in sub-arctic peatlands. Despite considerable variation in peat chemistry and microbial community composition with depth the temperature sensitivity was comparable throughout the active layer. Our study shows that functional organic chemistry controls both soil respiration rates and the composition of the microbial community. Furthermore, if these peatlands collapse and flood on thawing, they are unlikely to become large emitters of CH4 without additional input of labile substrates. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatlands are carbon-accumulating wetland ecosystems, developed through an imbalance among organic matter production and decomposition processes. Soil saturation is the principal cause of anoxic conditions that constrain organic matter decay. Accordingly, changes in the hydrologic regime will affect the carbon (C) dynamics in forested peatlands. Our objective is to review ecological studies and experiments on managed peatlands that provide a basis for assessing the effects of an altered hydrology on C dynamics. We conclude that climate change influences will be mediated primarily through the hydrologic cycle. A lower water table resulting from altered precipitation patterns and increased atmospheric temperature may be expected to decrease soil CH4 and increase CO2 emissions from the peat surface. Correspondingly, the C balance in forested peatlands is also sensitive to management and restoration prescriptions. Increases in soil CO2 efflux do not necessarily equate with net losses from the soil C pool. While the fundamentals of the C balance in peatlands are well-established, the combined affects of global change stressors and management practices are best considered using process-based biogeochemical models. Long-term studies are needed both for validation and to provide a framework for longitudinal assessments of the peatland C cycle.

AB Water tables in high-latitude peatlands are expected to fall because of climate change, with significant consequences for carbon cycling in these ecosystems. At present, the understanding of how climate-induced changes will affect soil microbial communities and functions in peatlands still remains controversial. In this study, we compared the potential activities of soil oxidase and hydrolytic enzymes and microbial communities at different depths in a minerotrophic peatland, part of which had been drained for many years and part of which was natural. The results showed that the microbial communities and enzyme activities differed considerably between the drained peat and the natural peat, and that the degree of change varied by depth in the profile. The soil oxidase activities and hydrolase activities (beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) in the oxic zone (0-10 cm) were higher in the drained peat than in the natural peat, but the beta-1,4-glucosidase activities decreased in the oxic zone after drainage. Soil enzyme activities in the anoxic zone were lower in the drained peat than in the natural peat. This suggests that drainage disturbance in this peatland does not support enhanced oxidative enzyme activity as hypothesized by the "enzyme-latch" mechanism. The soil total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and bacterial, fungal, and actinomycetic PLFAs in the oxic zone were lower in the drained peat than in the natural peat. The total PLFAs and bacterial PLFAs were higher in the transitional zone of the drained peat than the natural peat, but remained similar in the anoxic zone of the drained and natural peat. The fungi/bacteria and gram-positive/gram-negative ratios were lower in the drained peat than in the natural peat. The soil bacterial communities was strongly and positively linked with the beta-1,4-glucosidase activities involved in carbon transformation, whereas the fungi was positively associated with oxidase activities driving carbon oxidation. We found that these variations in the microbial communities and enzyme activities were associated with differences in the litter quality, soil organic carbon, soil moisture content, and the pH between the drained peat and natural peat. These observations indicate a modification in microbial communities and their activities reflective of changing peat C cycling. The observed reduction in microbial biomass with peatland drainage appears to have also resulted in reductions in enzyme activity suggesting potential limits to the 'enzyme-latch' mechanism for peatland C loss following longer-term drainage.

AB Northern peatlands have been accumulating organic matter since the start of the Holocene, and are now a substantial store of terrestrial carbon. However, their current status as carbon sinks is less clear, because of the possible effects of climate change, air pollution, grazing and drainage etc., and the difficulties of accurate measurement with suitable time resolution. Such measurements are particularly lacking in the UK. Here, we present multi-year eddy covariance measurements of the carbon fluxes at a relatively undisturbed ombrotrophic blanket bog in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. The site consistently acted as a moderate sink for CO2 over all the measurement years (mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of -114 g C m(-2) y(-1)), similar in magnitude to other measurements in the boreal and tundra zones, and rather higher than the existing measurements at other sites in the UK and Ireland. Generally, the NEE of CO2 was relatively insensitive to moderate inter-annual variations in weather. Non-CO2 losses comprised 11% of gross primary production, mainly from methane emissions. Accounting for these terms, the net ecosystem carbon balance was -50 g C-CO2 eq m(-2) y(-1). The contemporary carbon sink was larger than estimates from local peat cores, based on peat accumulation over the last several thousand years, but in the middle of the range of estimates which used spheroidal carbonaceous particles to estimate peat accumulation rates over the last century.

AB Iron (Fe) plays a key role in elemental cycling at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces by stabilizing carbon (C), phosphorus (P), and nutrient cations through physicochemical associations and by potentially releasing these elements following the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). However, the ecosystem-scale importance of Fe redox cycling and its responses to climate change remain unclear in precipitation-fed peatlands (bogs), C-rich wetlands with very low mineral content. We tested impacts of Fe redox cycling on C and nutrient release in two bogs in northern Minnesota and in Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE), an ecosystem-scale warming experiment. Concentrations of Fe(III) declined from the peat surface to 50 cm depth (31 to 0.5 mu mol g(-1)) and co-occurred with Fe(II) (10 to 30 mu mol g(-1)). Chemical reduction of Fe(III) released C and P from variably saturated (0-30 cm) peat (106-1006 mu mol C g(-1); 0.6-5 mu mol P g(-1)), and Fe-bound C was similar to previous measurements from upland mineral soils. Concentrations of Fe(II) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were strongly (R-2 = 0.56-0.78) and positively correlated in water samples measured at SPRUCE enclosure outlets and ambient near-surface porewater. Concentrations of Fe(II) also correlated positively with P at warmer SPRUCE temperature treatments and increased with experimental warming, but stabilized at the highest temperature treatments as water depth declined. Although bogs have low total mineral content, mass balance measurements indicated that atmospheric deposition could in principle sustain significant Fe cycling and hydrologic losses in these ecosystems. Overall, Fe redox cycling significantly impacted C and nutrient dynamics in these mineral-poor bogs, contributing to strong correlations between Fe(II) and DOC in water samples. Increased Fe(III) reduction with warmer temperatures will likely promote peatland C and nutrient release, impacting ecosystem C budgets both directly and indirectly by enhancing decomposition and productivity.

AB The water content of the topsoil is one of the key factors controlling biogeochemical processes, greenhouse gas emissions and biosphere - atmosphere interactions in many ecosystems, particularly in northern peatlands. In these wetland ecosystems, the water content of the photosynthetic active peatmoss layer is crucial for ecosystem functioning and carbon sequestration, and is sensitive to future shifts in rainfall and drought characteristics. Current peatland models differ in the degree in which hydrological feedbacks are included, but how this affects peatmoss drought projections is unknown.
   The aim of this paper was to systematically test whether the level of hydrological detail in models could bias projections of water content and drought stress for peatmoss in northern peatlands using downscaled projections for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in the current (1991-2020) and future climate (2061-2090). We considered four model variants that either include or exclude moss (rain)water storage and peat volume change, as these are two central processes in the hydrological self-regulation of peatmoss carpets. Model performance was validated using field data of a peatland in northern Sweden.
   Including moss water storage as well as peat volume change resulted in a significant improvement of model performance, despite the extra parameters added. The best performance was achieved if both processes were included. Including moss water storage and peat volume change consistently reduced projected peatmoss drought frequency with >50%, relative to the model excluding both proces'ses. Projected peatmoss drought frequency in the growing season was 17% smaller under future climate than current climate, but was unaffected by including the hydrological self-regulating processes.
   Our results suggest that ignoring these two fine-scale processes important in hydrological self-regulation of northern peatlands will have large consequences for projected climate change impact on ecosystem processes related to topsoil water content, such as greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Peatlands have persisted as massive carbon sinks over millennia, even during past periods of climate change. The commonly accepted theory of abiotic controls (mainly anoxia and low temperature) over carbon decomposition cannot fully explain how vast low-latitude shrub/tree dominated (wooded) peatlands consistently accrete peat under warm and seasonally unsaturated conditions. Here we show, by comparing the composition and ecological traits of microbes between Sphagnum- and shrub-dominated peatlands, that slow-growing microbes decisively dominate the studied shrub-dominated peatlands, concomitant with plant-induced increases in highly recalcitrant carbon and phenolics. The slow-growing microbes metabolize organic matter thirty times slower than the fast-growing microbes that dominate our Sphagnum-dominated site. We suggest that the high-phenolic shrub/tree induced shifts in microbial composition may compensate for positive effects of temperature and/or drought on metabolism over time in peatlands. This biotic self-sustaining process that modulates abiotic controls on carbon cycling may improve projections of long-term, climate-carbon feedbacks in peatlands. A dominance of slow-growing microbes reduces carbon loss in peatlands with predominantly woody vegetation and may help with peatland preservation under climate change, according to a comparison of microbial communities from different types of peatlands.

AB Peatland ecosystems have been consistent carbon (C) sinks for millennia, but it has been predicted that exposure to warmer temperatures and drier conditions associated with climate change will shift the balance between ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration providing a positive feedback to atmospheric CO2 concentration. Our main objective was to determine the sensitivity of ecosystem photosynthesis, respiration and net ecosystem production (NEP) measured by eddy covariance, to variation in temperature and water table depth associated with interannual shifts in weather during 2004-2009. Our study was conducted in a moderately rich treed fen, the most abundant peatland type in western Canada, in a region (northern Alberta) where peatland ecosystems are a significant landscape component. During the study, the average growing season (May-October) water depth declined approximately 38 cm, and temperature [expressed as cumulative growing degree days (GDD, March-October)] varied approximately 370 GDD. Contrary to previous predictions, both ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration showed similar increases in response to warmer and drier conditions. The ecosystem remained a strong net sink for CO2 with an average NEP (+/- SD) of 189 +/- 47 g C m-2 yr-1. The current net CO2 uptake rates were much higher than C accumulation in peat determined from analyses of the relationship between peat age and cumulative C stock. The balance between C addition to, and total loss from, the top 0-30 cm depth (peat age range 0-70 years) of shallow peat cores averaged 43 +/- 12 g C m-2 yr-1. The apparent long-term average rate of net C accumulation in basal peat samples was 19-24 g C m-2 yr-1. The difference between current rates of net C uptake and historical rates of peat accumulation is likely a result of vegetation succession and recent increases in tree establishment and productivity.

AB Global warming is expected to have greater impacts on northern peatlands in coming decade than most other ecosystems. Bacterial and methanogen communities in peatlands play a role in greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a feedback to global climate change. We investigated 3-degree warming effects on gas emissions (CO2 and CH4) and bacterial and methanogen communities in different depths of peat mire for 3 growing seasons. Warming doubled CO2 fluxes from the warming treatments compared to that from the control (P=0.08). Although CH4 fluxes were higher in the warming treatment, it was not a significant increase. Warming caused a shift in the composition of bacterial communities in the surface (1-3 cm, P<0.01) and middle layers (9-11 cm, P < 0.01), but not in the deep layer (17-19 cm). There were few changes in the diversity indices and quantity of bacterial communities due to the warming treatments. Warming significantly decreased the richness. Shannon diversity index, and quantity of methanogens. However, the composition was hardly related to temperature. The ratios of methanogens to bacteria in terms of gene copy numbers significantly decreased by a factor of 2-6 due to elevated temperature. The composition and diversity of bacteria and methanogens, respectively, were significantly related to soil depth. Temperature and soil depth interacted significantly on the bacterial diversity (P=0.01). The results suggest that warming is likely to influence the function and structure of microbial communities in peat lands. However, warming effects would be different with the type of microbial community and soil depth. Warming could favor bacterial communities over methanogens, which may induce changes in balance between CO2 and CH4 emissions from peatlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change and water table drawdown impact the community structure and diversity of peatland soil prokaryotes. Nonetheless, how soil prokaryotes of different water tables respond to climate change remains largely unknown. This study used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the variation in soil prokaryotes under scenarios of warming, rainfall reduction, and their combination in different water table peatlands on the Zoige Plateau in China. Stimulated climate change affected some of the diversity indexes and relative abundances of soil prokaryotes in three water table peatlands. Additionally, those from the dry-rewetting event peatland had the most dominant phyla (genera) that showed significant changes in a relative abundance due to the simulated climate change treatments. Regarding functional microbial groups of carbon and nitrogen cycling, simulated climate change did not affect the abundances of the Euryarchaeota, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Methanobacterium in three water table peatlands, except NC10 and Nitrospirae. Redundancy analysis showed that the prokaryotic community variation was primary impacted by site properties of the different water table peatlands rather than the simulated climate change treatments. Moreover, the water table, total carbon, total nitrogen, and soil pH were the primary factors for the overall variation in the soil prokaryotic structure. This study provides a theoretical guidance for management strategies in the Zoige peatland, under climate change scenarios. More attention should be given to the interactive effects of peatland water table drawdown and simulated climate changes for better restorative efforts in water table drawdown, rather than simply adapting to climate change.

AB Wildfire represents the single largest disturbance to the ecohydrological function of northern peatlands. Alterations to peatland thermal behavior as a result of wildfire will modify the carbon balance of these important long-term global carbon stores and regulate post-fire ecosystem recovery. We simulate the 3-D thermal behavior of a peatland that has been disturbed by wildfire to identify how changes in peat temperatures emerge from changes to the surface energy balance and peat thermal properties. Peat temperatures are simulated within two adjacent peatlands, one area having burned 4 years previously, the second which has been wildfire-free for 75 years. We demonstrate that there is only a small alteration to the thermal response in Sphagnum fuscum hummocks that are not severely burnt within the wildfire. In contrast, wildfire produces important changes to the energy balance of Sphagnum hollows. A large reduction in the latent heat flux post-fire increases surface temperatures by up to 30 degrees C during daytime summer conditions. However, temperatures through the peat profile are insensitive to these increases in surface temperature. The low surface moisture content of near-surface peat insulates the profile from these higher temperatures and, at depths below 0.015 m, only small differences are identifiable between burned and unburned hollow temperatures. Nevertheless, we argue that these alterations to near-surface temperatures and evaporation rates likely substantially influence the thermal and hydrological conditions post-wildfire, impacting the peatland recovery.

AB The current paradigm in peatland ecology is that the organic matter inputs from plant photosynthesis (e.g. moss litter) exceed that of decomposition, tipping the metabolic balance in favour of carbon (C) storage. Here, we investigated an alternative hypothesis, whereby exudates released by microalgae can actually accelerate C losses from the surface waters of northern peatlands by stimulating dissolved organic C (DOC) decomposition in a warmer environment expected with climate change. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the biodegradability of fen DOC in a factorial design with and without algal DOC in both ambient (15 degrees C) and elevated (20 degrees C) water temperatures during a laboratory bioassay. When DOC sources were evaluated separately, decomposition rates were higher in treatments with algal DOC only than with fen DOC only, indicating that the quality of the organic matter influenced degradability. A mixture of substrates (1/2 algal DOC + 1/2 fen DOC) exceeded the expected level of biodegradation (i.e. the average of the individual substrate responses) by as much as 10%, and the magnitude of this effect increased to more than 15% with warming. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), a proxy for aromatic content, was also significantly higher (i.e. more humic) in the mixture treatment than expected from SUVA(254) values in single substrate treatments. Accelerated decomposition in the presence of algal DOC was coupled with an increase in bacterial biomass, demonstrating that enhanced metabolism was associated with a more abundant microbial community. These results present an alternative energy pathway for heterotrophic consumers to breakdown organic matter in northern peatlands. Since decomposition in northern peatlands is often limited by the availability of labile organic matter, this mechanism could become increasingly important as a pathway for decomposition in the surface waters of northern peatlands where algae are expected to be more abundant in conditions associated with ongoing climate change.

AB Peatlands are globally important long-term sinks of carbon, however there is concern that enhanced peat decomposition and moss moisture stress due to climate change mediated drought will reduce moss productivity making these ecosystems vulnerable to carbon loss and associated long-term degradation. Peatlands are resilient to summer drought moss stress because of negative ecohydrological feedbacks that generally maintain a wet peat surface, but where feedbacks may be contingent on peat depth. We tested this 'survival of the deepest' hypothesis by examining water table (WT) position, near-surface moisture content, and soil water tension in peatlands that differ in size, peat depth, and catchment area during a summer drought. All shallow sites (<40 cm depth) lost their WT (i.e., the groundwater well was dry) for considerable time during the drought period. Near-surface soil water tension increased dramatically at shallow sites following WT loss, increasing similar to 5-7.5x greater at shallow sites compared to deep sites (>= 40 cm depth). During a mid-summer drought intensive field survey, we found that 60-67% of plots at shallow sites exceeded a 100 mb tension threshold used to infer moss water stress. Unlike the shallow sites, tension typically did not exceed this 100 mb threshold at the deep sites. Using species dependent water content - chlorophyll fluorescence thresholds and relations between volumetric water content and WT depth, Monte Carlo simulations suggest that moss had nearly twice the likelihood of being stressed at shallow sites (0.38 +/- 0.24) compared to deep sites (0.22 +/- 0.18). This study provides evidence that mosses in shallow peatland may be particularly vulnerable to warmer and drier climates in the future, but where species composition may play an important role. We argue that a critical 'threshold' peat depth specific for different hydrogeological and hydroclimatic regions can be used to assess what peatlands are especially vulnerable to climate change mediated drought.

AB Throughout northeast China, the widely distributed peatlands have formed a large carbon (C) pool. However, the relationship between peatland initiation and climate controls is still poorly documented and understood. Understanding the responses of these C-rich ecosystems to past climate change will provide useful insights into projecting the fate of peatland C in the future. In this study, we present a detailed historical reconstruction of peatland development in northeast China based on 312 basal peat dates, and examine the relationship between Holocene peatland dynamics and climate sensitivity. Our results indicate that peatland initiation started in the early Holocene, and that the majority of peatlands were initiated by and developed during the late Holocene. After the most intensive initiation period of 4.2-0.8ka, the rate of peatland development slowed, which was concomitant with decreasing insolation and monsoon intensity. The widespread peatland initiation in the late Holocene might have been caused by the cool and moist climate patterns. The optimum timing of the peatland development was not uniform across northeast China, and these spatio-temporal differences indicate the influences of regional climate and terrain on peatland initiation. Peat-core data show variations in the long-term apparent rate of C accumulation (LORCA) during the Holocene, with an average rate of 37.2gCm(-2)a(-1). The peak LORCA occurred during 10.5-9.0ka, probably in response to higher temperatures and stronger East Asia summer monsoon intensities. Both temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the peatland initiation and C dynamics in this region.

AB \ Northern peatlands have accumulated a large amount of organic carbon (C) in their thick peat profile. Climate change and associated variations in soil environments are expected to have significant impacts on the C balance of these ecosystems, but the magnitude is still highly uncertain. Verifying and understanding the influences of changes in environmental factors on C gas fluxes in biogeochemical models are essential for forecasting feedbacks between C gas fluxes and climate change. In this study, we applied a biogeochemical model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to assess impacts of air temperature (T-A) and water table (WT) on C gas fluxes in an Alaskan peatland. DNDC was validated against field measurements of net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CH4 fluxes under manipulated surface soil temperature and WT conditions in a moderate rich fen. The validation demonstrates that DNDC was able to capture the observed impacts of the manipulations in soil environments on C gas fluxes. To investigate responses of C gas fluxes to changes in T-A and soil water condition, we conducted a series of simulations with varying T-A and WT. The results demonstrate that (1) uptake rates of CO2 at the site were reduced by either too colder or warmer temperatures and generally increased with increasing soil moisture; (2) CH4 emissions showed an increasing trend as T-A increased or WT rose toward the peat surface; and (3) the site could shift from a net greenhouse gas (GHG) sink into a net GHG source under some warm and/or dry conditions. A sensitivity analysis evaluated the relative importance of T-A and WT to C gas fluxes. The results indicate that both T-A and WT played important roles in regulating NEE and CH4 emissions and that within the investigated ranges of the variations in T-A and WT, changes in WT showed a greater impact than changes in T-A on NEE, CH4 fluxes, and net C gas fluxes at the study fen.

AB Cushion plant dominated peatlands are key ecosystems in tropical alpine regions of the Andes in South America. The cushion plants have formed peat bodies over thousands of years that fill many valley bottoms, and the forage produced by the plants is critical for native and nonnative domesticated mammals. The sources and flow paths of water supporting these peatlands remain largely unknown. Some studies have suggested that glacier meltwater streams support some peatlands, and that the ongoing loss of glaciers and their meltwaters could lead to the loss or diminishment of peatlands. We analysed the hydrologic regime of 10 peatlands in four mountain regions of Bolivia and Peru using groundwater monitoring. Groundwater levels in peatlands were relatively stable and within 20 cm of the ground surface during the rainy season, and many sites had water tables 40-90 cm below the ground surface in the dry season. Topographic and groundwater elevations in the peatlands demonstrated that the water source of all 10 peatlands was hillslope groundwater flowing from lateral moraines, talus, colluvium, or bedrock aquifers into the peatlands. There was little to no input from streams, whether derived from glacier melt or other sources, and glacier melt could not have recharged the hillslope aquifers supporting peatlands. We measured the stable water isotopes in water samples taken during different seasons, distributed throughout the catchments, and the values are consistent with this interpretation. Our findings indicate that peatlands in the study region are recharged by hillslope groundwater discharge rather than stream water and may not be as vulnerable to glacial decline as other studies have indicated. However, both glaciers and peatlands are susceptible to changing thermal and precipitation regimes that could affect the persistence of peatlands.

AB Peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition. They are characterized by a near-surface water table controlled by a combination of internal and external processes, influenced by short-term meteorological and long-term climate variations among other factors. Site-specific conditions, such as peat hydrodynamic properties, surface vegetation patterns, and hydrogeological setting also substantially influence water table dynamics. The objective of this work was to characterize the influence of hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions on water table depths (WTD) and on fluctuations therein in seven ombrotrophic peatlands in or near the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). Up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient locations were monitored in the seven peatlands, using dipwells with hourly WTD recordings. WTD was also monitored in the marginal minerotrophic zone found in three of the seven peatlands. Additionally, heads in the outflow (i.e., receiving diffused water from the peatland) and inflow (i.e., providing diffused water to the peatland) zones within the adjacent mineral deposits were monitored in seven and three peatlands respectively, using piezometers with hourly hydraulic head recordings. Hydraulic conductivities for the outflow zones ranged between 1.4*10(-7) and 8.5*10(-3) cm/s, whereas those of the inflow zones ranged between 5.6*10(-7) and 3.9*10(-6) cm/s. Evapotranspiration was shown to be the dominant factor controlling monthly cumulative water table decreases (MCD), while precipitation dominated the monthly cumulative water table increases (MCI). A strong correlation was found between mean peatland WTD and outflow zone hydraulic conductivity. Peatlands that were identified as being strongly connected with the adjacent mineral deposits in a diffuse underground outflow zone showed the greatest variations in water storage. This study highlights the importance of the connection between peatlands and adjacent mineral deposits in controlling WTD, as found for those located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The results show that water table fluctuations are strongly controlled by meteorological conditions, and that hydrogeological setting exerts a strong control on MCI and MCD. Moreover, this work shows that WTD in ombrotrophic peatlands is influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the outflow zones, and confirms that aquifer - peatland connectivity influences peatland water storage variations, and therefore peatland vulnerability to disturbances in aquifer groundwater levels.

AB As the global climate changes so will the balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and release from peatlands. The changes occurring within peatlands will be complex, making their future carbon (C) responses difficult to predict. We studied three boreal fen peatlands along a nutrient gradient in northern Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we investigated how abiotic and biotic responses of the fens interacted with seasonal and annual hydrologic variability. We further assessed the role that a local disturbance, such as inundation due to beaver dams, has in confounding fen C dynamics. We conducted these assessments by applying the process-based model Wetland-DNDC, which we parameterized, calibrated and corroborated with field data, to examine how C dynamics were affected by fen type (rich, intermediate and poor), historical and projected climate and local flooding disturbance. We found inter-annual variability in greenhouse gas (CO2 and methane, CH4) dynamics to be large among fens, with larger coefficients of variation for heterotrophic respiration and CH4 effluxes (a range of 40-85% and 31-58%, respectively) than gross primary production (a range of 9-26%). This annual variability in C effluxes correlated to meteorological conditions and water table, although the specific drivers differed among fens. Scenarios of prolonged flooding and drought had opposite effects on C effluxes. Drought increased CO2 efflux by 43%, 175% and 65% for rich, intermediate and poor fens, respectively, and decreased CH4 efflux by 11% and 14% for the intermediate and poor, but increased CH4 efflux by 19% for the rich fen. In contrast, shallow flooding decreased CO2 by 40%, 72% and 57% in the rich, intermediate and poor fen, and increased CH4 effluxes by 87%, 202% and 269%, respectively. Flooding by beaver dams during a prolonged drought moderately decreased CO2 (29%, 66% and 53%) but strongly increased CH4 efflux by 121%, 261% and 333%, respectively, than the flooding only. We conclude that the interacting controls on greenhouse gas dynamics differ among fens types, contributing to the magnitude of effluxes and their response to changing conditions. We propose that effects of water table level, peat nutrient status, and vegetation composition, and their interactions, on C processes require enhanced understanding to define natural ranges of spatial and temporal variability. Only then will it be possible to adequately predict future peatland C responses to climate and other environmental changes. As such, short-term experimental results or field studies should not be used to predict future peatland C dynamics without an understanding of the natural range of variation in the environmental drivers and the response of C processes to those drivers.

AB The sensitivity of peatland carbon (C) fluxes to changes in climate and hydrology are uncertain due to the complex interactions between plants and peat properties. In this study we examine how peat cores taken from under three plant functional types (PFT) (bryophyte, graminoid and ericoid) differ in their biotic and abiotic properties and how this indirectly modulates the response of C fluxes to environmental change. Peat cores taken from under three PFTs had their aboveground vegetation removed to exclude direct plant-mediated effects, and were incubated in a temperature x water table factorial experiment at 12, 14 and 16 degrees C (air temperature) with the water table level -25, -15 or -5 cm below the peat surface. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured over 11 months. Emissions of CO(2)and CH(4)increased with temperature, with strong positive (CH4) and negative (CO2) interactions with increasing water table level. There were significant effects of removed PFT on the environmental sensitivity of CH4, but not CO(2)fluxes. CH(4)emissions were greatest in peat with graminoid PFT removed at the warmest temperature but these indirect effects were not explained by peat abiotic or biotic properties, which did not differ between PFTs. These results show that climate change-induced expansion of graminoids in northern peatlands will have direct and indirect effects on C fluxes and the stability of peatland C stores. These responses will be determined by the interactive effects of vegetation composition, hydrology and warming on methane-cycling microbial communities. Highlights
   Peatland carbon flux strength under a changing climate is influenced by PFT. Peat from under graminoid PFT emits more methane than peat from under bryophyte or ericoid PFT. Prior PFT cover influenced methane emissions, but did not affect peat abiotic or biotic properties. Increases in graminoid cover with climate change could indirectly increase peatland methane fluxes.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems that store approximately one third of terrestrial organic carbon. Non-growing season carbon fluxes significantly contribute to annual carbon budgets in peatlands, yet their response to climate change is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the governing environmental variables of non-growing season carbon emissions in a northern peatland. We develop a support-vector regression model using a continuous 13-year dataset of eddy covariance flux measurements from the Mer Blue Bog, Canada. We determine that only seven variables were needed to reproduce carbon fluxes, which were most sensitive to net radiation above the canopy, soil temperature, wind speed and soil moisture. We find that changes in soil temperature and photosynthesis drove changes in net carbon flux. Assessing net ecosystem carbon exchange under three representative concentration pathways, we project a 103% increase in peatland carbon loss by 2100 under a high emissions scenario. We suggest that peatland carbon losses constitute a strong positive climate feedback loop.
   Future changes in non-growing season conditions, particularly irradiance and temperature, will enhance carbon emissions from a northern peatland, according to projections with a data-driven machine learning model.

AB Analyses of peat humification, testate amoebae, carbon and nitrogen content have been carried Out Oil a peat sequence from Altabergsmossen. At Gullbergbymossen testate amoebae and peat humification were analysed. Both bogs are located in eastern central Sweden. The longest sequence, Altabergsmossen, covers the last 150 yr and the data from Gullbergbymossen covers the last 60 yr, both with a time resolution of ca. 2-4 yr cm(-1). The different proxies were compared to each other and were also compared to instrumental meteorological data. Correlation between peat humification and C/N ratios is high whereas the correlation is low between these physical/chemical parameters and reconstructed water tables inferred from the testate amoebae assemblages. High peat humification values and C/N ratios greater than 50 indicate aerobic decay and are thought to reflect the thickness of the acrotelm. High humification values and low C/N ratios are recorded in peat deposited between 1965 and 1980, whereas the dry period starts in the early 1970s according to instrumental meteorological data and inferred water-table depth. The difference in the timing of the onset of a dry-shift between the physical/chennical proxies and meteorological data and testate amoebae derived water table changes is interpreted as renewed decay of already deposited peat. The term secondary decomposition is used for this process. The secondary decomposition process has implications for interpreting physical/chemical and biological parameters in peat as they may be Out of phase during the beginning of a dry-shift.

AB Northern high latitudes contain large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC), of which Alaskan terrestrial ecosystems account for a substantial proportion. In this study, the SOC accumulation in Alaskan terrestrial ecosystems over the last 15 000 years was simulated using a process-based biogeochemistry model for both peatland and non-peatland ecosystems. Comparable with the previous estimates of 2570 PgC in peatland and 13-22 Pg C in non-peatland soils within 1m depth in Alaska using peat-core data, our model estimated a total SOC of 36-63 Pg C at present, including 27-48 PgC in peatland soils and 9-15 Pg C in non-peatland soils. Current vegetation stored 2.5-3.7 Pg C in Alaska, with 0.3-0.6 PgC in peatlands and 2.2-3.1 Pg C in non-peatlands. The simulated average rate of peat C accumulation was 2.3 TgC yr(-1), with a peak value of 5.1 Tg C yr(-1) during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the early Holocene, 4-fold higher than the average rate of 1.4 TgC yr(-1) over the rest of the Holocene. The SOC accumulation slowed down, or even ceased, during the neoglacial climate cooling after the mid-Holocene, but increased again in the 20th century. The model-estimated peat depths ranged from 1.1 to 2.7 m, similar to the field-based estimate of 2.29m for the region. We found that the changes in vegetation and their distributions were the main factors in determining the spatial variations of SOC accumulation during different time periods. Warmer summer temperature and stronger radiation seasonality, along with higher precipitation in the HTM and the 20th century, might have resulted in the extensive peatland expansion and carbon accumulation.

AB Boreal and arctic regions are predicted to warm faster and more strongly than temperate latitudes. Peatlands in these regions contain large stocks of soil carbon in frozen soil and these may effect a strong positive feedback on climate change. We modelled the predicted effects of climate change and wildfire on permafrost in organic soils using a peatland-specific soil thermal model to simulate soil temperatures. We evaluated the model at a lowland black spruce site in Alaska and a sedge-dominated Canadian arctic fen. We estimated the response of soil temperatures and the active layer thickness (AcLTh) under several climate change scenarios. With surface soil temperatures increased by 4.4 degrees C-5.4 degrees C, soil temperatures at 100 cm depth increased by 3.6 degrees C-4.3 degrees C, the AcLTh increased by 12-30 cm, the zone of partially thawed soil increased, and the number of thaw days increased by 17-26 %. Wildfire caused AcLTh to increase by 26-48 % in the year following fire; AcLTh differences in 2091-2100 were significant (8 cm) at one site. By 2100, climate change effects on AcLTh were larger than wildfire effects suggesting that persistent temperature increases will have a more substantial effect on permafrost than the transient effects of disturbance.

AB Mid- to high-latitude peatlands are a major terrestrial carbon stock but become carbon sources during droughts, which are increasingly frequent as a result of climate warming. A critical question within this context is the sensitivity to drought of peatland microbial food webs. Microbiota drive key ecological and biogeochemical processes, but their response to drought is likely to impact these processes. Peatland food webs have, however, been little studied, especially the response of microbial predators. We studied the response of microbial predators (testate amoebae, ciliates, rotifers, and nematodes) living in Sphagnum moss carpet to droughts, and their influence on lower trophic levels and on related microbial enzyme activity. We assessed the impact of reduced water availability on microbial predators in two peatlands using experimental (Linje mire, Poland) and natural (Forbonnet mire, France) water level gradients, reflecting a sudden change in moisture regime (Linje), and a typically drier environment (Forbonnet). The sensitivity of different microbial groups to drought was size dependent; large sized microbiota such as testate amoebae declined most under dry conditions (-41% in Forbonnet and -80% in Linje). These shifts caused a decrease in the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR). We related microbial enzymatic activity to PPMR; we found that a decrease in PPMR can have divergent effects on microbial enzymatic activity. In a community adapted to drier conditions, decreasing PPMR stimulated microbial enzyme activity, while in extreme drought experiment, it reduced microbial activity. These results suggest that microbial enzymatic activity resulting from food web structure is optimal only within a certain range of PPMR, and that different trophic mechanisms are involved in the response of peatlands to droughts. Our findings confirm the importance of large microbial consumers living at the surface of peatlands on the functioning of peatlands, and illustrate their value as early warning indicators of change.

AB Water- level changes for the last 125 years were reconstructed from two ombrotrophic mires in eastern central Sweden using testate amoebae assemblages. The reconstructed water tables show the same overall pattern with high water tables during the 1950s and 1960s and low water levels from the 1970s until present. The similarity in the two records supports the hypothesis that water- table changes in the ombrotrophic mires of this area are driven by climate change. Correlation of decadal means of reconstructed water levels and instrumental meteorological data was performed to examine the relationship between water table and climatic variability. The results show that the reconstructed water tables are correlated with changes in mean annual temperature ( p < 0.05). This contrasts with similar data for other parts of Europe where correlations have been found with summer or annual precipitation and temperature. We suggest that low rainfall in this area of Sweden makes the peatlands more susceptible to changing temperature and that the lack of a response to precipitation is a function of low rainfall variability over the comparison period. The results show that mire surface wetness responses to climate change are spatially variable and greater attention should be given to understanding this variability if more accurate palaeoclimatic inferences are to be drawn from longer Holocene records.

AB Aims: Peat bogs are ecosystems with a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and varied characteristic structure. Nutrient poor peat bogs are one of the most important providers for maintaining the biodiversity of algae sensitive to eutrophication. However, they are also one of the most threatened oligotrophic biotopes in Europe. Algae, especially desmids and diatoms, are the dominant aquatic organisms in European peat bogs. Despite their importance, long-term algal species monitoring is limited, although it is a crucial aspect of algal biodiversity conservation. Study area: The acidic oligo-ombrotrophic Biale Lugi peat bogs located in the southern part of Poland. Methods: We sampled five peat bogs zones (riparian, alder carr, marshy coniferous forest, transitional mire and raised bog) in two summer vegetation seasons (2010 and 2011), and compared our findings with the algological material collected in 1996-1998, and also in 1999-2000, to assess local diversity of freshwater algae over the long-term. We examined diatom and desmid species diversity in acidic oligo-ombrotrophic peat bogs and determined the main environmental factors influencing their development. In each zone, physical (stream, river width, depth, temperature) and chemical (dissolved oxygen, conductivity and pH) data were collected. The color, water turbidity and concentration of orthophosphates, nitrates, ammonium nitrogen and sulfates were investigated. Results and conclusions: Altogether, we found 65 desmid and 115 diatom taxa. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus and iron concentrations were found to have a positive effect on the development and biodiversity of the studied algal assemblages. Significant differences occurred among the spatial distribution of desmids and diatoms in relation to the zone type. The highest Shannon H' diversity index was recorded for alder carr, whereas the lowest for the raised bog. Our results confirm that desmids and diatoms are dominant aquatic groups in Polish and European peat bogs and are strongly influenced by environmental factors.

AB Mires are characterized by plant communities of high conservation and societal value, which have experienced a major decline in area in many parts of the world, particularly Europe. Evidence suggests that they may be particularly vulnerable to changes in climate and nutrient addition. Although they have been the focus of extensive paleoecological research, few attempts have been made to examine the dynamics of mire vegetation during the current era of anthropogenic environmental change.
   To assess long-term change in the spatial structure and composition of a lowland mire community, in 2016 we resurveyed plots first surveyed in 1951. Measures of species richness and composition were compared between the two surveys, and changes in community composition were related to plant traits.
   Overall, mean species richness declined by 26%. The area of occupancy declined in 37% of species, which were primarily oligotrophic species typical of nutrient-poor bog communities. Conversely, occupancy increased in 21% of species, especially those that were more tolerant of higher nutrient availability. These changes were associated with variation in plant functional traits, as indicated by an increase mean Ellenberg trait values for nitrogen and mean temperature, and a decline in values for precipitation. These results suggest that eutrophication and climate change have been key drivers of floristic change on this site.
   Synthesis. This investigation provides a rare assessment of the dynamics of a mire community over a multi-decadal interval. Results indicate that substantial change has occurred in the composition of the community, and the distribution of species within it. The investigation provides evidence of the impact of environmental change on the composition and structure of a lowland mire community, and highlights challenges for its future conservation.

AB Northern peatland water table position is tightly coupled to carbon (C) cycling dynamics and is predicted to change from shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns associated with global climate change. However, it is uncertain how long-term water table alterations will alter C dynamics in northern peatlands because most studies have focused on short-term water table manipulations. The goal of our study was to quantify the effect of long-term water table changes (similar to 80 years) on gaseous C fluxes in a peatland in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Chamber methods were utilized to measure ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and methane (CH4) fluxes in a peatland experiencing levee induced long-term water table drawdown and impoundment in relation to an unaltered site. Inundation raised water table levels by approximately similar to 10 cm and resulted in a decrease in ER and GPP, but an increase of CH4 emissions. Conversely, the drained sites, with water table levels similar to 15 cm lower, resulted in a significant increase in ER and GPP, but a decrease in CH4 emissions. However, NEE was not significantly different between the water table treatments. In summary, our data indicates that long-term water table drawdown and inundation was still altering peatland gaseous C fluxes, even after 80 years. In addition, many of the patterns we found were of similar magnitude to those measured in short-term studies, which indicates that short-term studies might be useful for predicting the direction and magnitude of future C changes in peatlands.

AB 1. Human activities have been a significant driver of environmental changes with tremendous consequences for carbon (C) dynamics. Peatlands are critical ecosystems because they store similar to 30% of the global soil organic C pool and are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic changes. The Zoige peatland on the eastern Tibet Plateau, as the largest alpine peatland in the world, accounts for 1 parts per thousand of global peat soil organic C storage. However, this peatland has experienced dramatic climate change including increased temperature and reduced precipitation in the past decades, which likely is responsible for a decline of the water-table and facilitated earthworm invasion, two major factors reducing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage of peatlands.
   2. Because earthworms often are more active in low-than in high-moisture peatlands, we hypothesized that the simultaneous occurrence of water-table decline and earthworm invasion would synergistically accelerate the release of SOC from peatland soil. We conducted a field experiment with a paired split-plot design, i.e. presence vs. absence of the invasive earthworms (Pheretima aspergillum) nested in drained vs. undrained plots, respectively, for 3 years within the homogenous Zoige peatland.
   3. Water-table decline significantly decreased soil water content and bulk density, resulting in a marked reduction of SOC storage. Moreover, consistent with our hypothesis, earthworm presence dramatically reduced SOC in the drained but not in the undrained peatland through the formation of deep burrows and decreasing bulk density of the lower soil layer over 3 years. The variation in SOC likely was due to changes in above-ground plant biomass, root growth and earthworm behaviour induced by the experimental treatments.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that incentive measures should be taken to prevent further water-table decline and earthworm invasion for maintaining the soil carbon pool in Zoige peatland. Artificial filling of drainage canals should be implemented to increase the water-table level, facilitating the recovery of drained peatlands. Moreover, the dispersal of earthworms and their cocoons attached to the roots of crop plants and tree saplings from low-lying areas to the Zoige region should be prevented.

AB Climate change has the potential to significantly impact the stability of large stocks of mercury (Hg) stored in peatland systems due to increasing temperatures, altered water table regimes and subsequent shifts in vascular plant communities. However, the Hg exchange dynamics between the atmosphere and peatlands are not well understood. At the PEATcosm Mesocosm Facility in Houghton, Michigan, total gaseous Hg (TGM) fluxes were monitored in a subset of 1-m(3) peat monoliths with altered water table positions (high and low) and vascular plant functional groups (sedge only, Ericaceae only or unmanipulated control) above the Sphagnum moss layer. At the SPRUCE bog in north-central Minnesota, TGM fluxes were measured from plots subjected to deep peat soil warming (up to +9 degrees C above ambient at a depth of 2 m). At PEATcosm, the strongest depositional trend was observed with the Low WT - sedge only treatment mesocosms with a mean TGM flux of -73.7 +/- 6.3 ng m(-2) d(-1), likely due to shuttling of Hg to the peat at depth by aerenchymous tissues. The highest total leaf surface and tissue Hg concentrations were observed with the Ericaceae shrubs. A negative correlation between TGM flux and Ericaceae total leaf surface area suggests an influence of shrubs in controlling Hg exchange through stomatal uptake, surface sorption and potentially, peat shading. Surface peat total Hg concentrations are highest in treatments with greatest deposition suggesting deposition controls Hg accumulation in surface peat. Fluxes in the SPRUCE plots ranged from -45.9 +/- 93.8 ng m(-2) d(-1) prior to the implementation of the deep warming treatments to -1.41 +/- 27.1 ng m(-2) d(-1) once warming targets were achieved at depth and +10.2 +/- 44.6 ng m(-2) d(-1) following prolonged deep soil warming. While these intervals did not differ significantly, a significant positive increase in the slope of the regression between flux and surface temperature was observed across the pre-treatment and warming periods. Shifts in vascular vegetation cover and peat warming as a result of climate change may significantly affect the dynamics of TGM fluxes between peatlands and the atmosphere. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sphagnum-dominated peatlands comprise a globally important pool of soil carbon (C) and are vulnerable to climate change. While peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum are known to harbor diverse microbial communities that mediate C and nitrogen (N) cycling in peatlands, the effects of climate change on Sphagnum microbiome composition and functioning are largely unknown. We investigated the impacts of experimental whole-ecosystem warming on the Sphagnum moss microbiome, focusing on N-2 fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs). To characterize the microbiome response to warming, we performed next-generation sequencing of small subunit (SSU) rRNA and nitrogenase (nifH) gene amplicons and quantified rates of N-2 fixation activity in Sphagnum fallax individuals sampled from experimental enclosures over 2 years in a northern Minnesota, USA bog. The taxonomic diversity of overall microbial communities and diazotroph communities, as well as N-2 fixation rates, decreased with warming (p < 0.05). Following warming, diazotrophs shifted from a mixed community of Nostocales (Cyanobacteria) and Rhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) to predominance of Nostocales. Microbiome community composition differed between years, with some diazotroph populations persisting while others declined in relative abundance in warmed plots in the second year. Our results demonstrate that warming substantially alters the community composition, diversity, and N-2 fixation activity of peat moss microbiomes, which may ultimately impact host fitness, ecosystem productivity, and C storage potential in peatlands.

AB Peatlands in the Western Boreal Plains act as important water sources in the landscape. Their persistence, despite potential evapotranspiration (PET) often exceeding annual precipitation, is attributed to various water storage mechanisms. One storage element that has been understudied is seasonal ground ice (SGI). This study characterized spring SGI conditions and explored its impacts on available energy, actual evapotranspiration, water table, and near surface soil moisture in a western boreal plains peatland. The majority of SGI melt took place over May 2017. Microtopography had limited impact on melt rates due to wet conditions. SGI melt released 139mm in ice water equivalent (IWE) within the top 30cm of the peat, and weak significant relationships with water table and surface moisture suggest that SGI could be important for maintaining vegetation transpiration during dry springs. Melting SGI decreased available energy causing small reductions in PET (<10mm over the melt period) and appeared to reduce actual evapotranspiration variability but not mean rates, likely due to slow melt rates. This suggests that melting SGI supplies water, allowing evapotranspiration to occur at near potential rates, but reduces the overall rate at which evapotranspiration could occur (PET). The role of SGI may help peatlands in headwater catchments act as a conveyor of water to downstream landscapes during the spring while acting as a supply of water for the peatland. Future work should investigate SGI influences on evapotranspiration under differing peatland types, wet and dry spring conditions, and if the spatial variability of SGI melt leads to spatial variability in evapotranspiration.

AB Initial findings from high-latitude ice-cores implied a relatively unvarying Holocene climate, in contrast to the major climate swings in the preceding late-Pleistocene. However, several climate archives from low latitudes imply a less than equable Holocene climate, as do recent studies on peat bogs in mainland north-west Europe, which indicate an abrupt climate cooling 2800 years ago, with parallels claimed in a range of climate archives elsewhere. A hypothesis that this claimed climate shift was global, and caused by reduced solar activity, has recently been disputed. Until now, no directly comparable data were available from the southern hemisphere to help resolve the dispute. Building on investigations of the vegetation history of an extensive mire in the Valle de Andorra, Tierra del Fuego, we took a further peat core from the bog to generate a high-resolution climate history through the use of determination of peat hurnification and quantitative leaf-count plant macrofossil analysis. Here, we present the new proxy-climate data from the bog in South America. The data are directly comparable with those in Europe, as they were produced using identical laboratory methods. They show that there was a major climate perturbation at the same time as in northwest European bogs. Its timinia, nature and apparent global synchronicity lend support to the notion of solar forcing of past climate change, amplified by oceanic circulation. This finding of a similar response simultaneously in both hemispheres may help validate and improve global climate models. That reduced solar activity might cause a global climatic change suggests that attention be paid also to consideration of any global climate response to increases in solar activity. This has implications for interpreting the relative contribution of climate drivers of recent 'global warming'. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Streamflow response in Boreal Plains catchments depends on hydrological connectivity between forested uplands, lakes, and peatlands, and their hydrogeomorphic setting. Expected future drying of the Boreal Plains ecozone is expected to reduce hydrological connectivity of landscape units. To better understand run-off generation during dry periods, we determined whether peatland and groundwater connectivity can dampen expected future water deficits in forests and lakes. We studied Pine Fen Creek catchment in the Boreal Plains ecozone of central Saskatchewan, Canada, which has a large, valley-bottom, terminally positioned peatland, two lakes, and forested uplands. A shorter intensive study permitted a more detailed partitioning of water inputs and outputs within the catchment during the low flow period, and an assessment of a 10-year data set provided insight into the function of the peatland over a range of climate conditions. Using a water balance approach, we learned that two key processes regulate flow of Pine Fen Creek. The cumulative impact of landscape unit hydrological connectivity and the peatland's hydrological functional state were needed to understand catchment response. There was evidence of a run-off threshold which, when crossed, changed the peatland's hydrological function from transmission to run-off generation. Results also suggest the peatland should behave more often as a transmitter of groundwater than as a generator of run-off under a drier climate future, owing to a reduced water supply.

AB A process-based model (Forest-DNDC) was applied to describe the possible impacts of climate change on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from a peat bog in European Russia. In the first step, Forest-DNDC was tested against CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy covariance method on an oligotrophic bog in a representative region of the southern taiga (56 degrees N33 degrees E). The results of model validations show that Forest-DNDC is capable of quantifying the CO2 fluxes from the bog ecosystem. In the second step, the validated model was used to estimate how the expected future changes of the air temperature and water table depth could affect the C dynamics in the bogs. It was shown that a decrease in the water table and an increase in temperature influence significantly the CO2 exchange between our bog ecosystem and the atmosphere. Under elevated temperature and deepened water table the bog ecosystems could become a significant source of atmospheric CO2.

AB Production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from peatland soil is controlled by rates of organic matter decomposition; soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is influenced by the quality of the SOM and the soil temperature. This study determined the effect of increasing temperature and SOM quality on rates of greenhouse-gas production in lab incubations from peat soils formed under different plant functional types found in temperate rich and poor fens of southern Ontario, Canada. Peat derived from different plant functional type (sedge, shrub, and non-vascular vegetation) between the fens was composed of different amounts of SOM, lignin, and cellulose. Rates of CO2 and CH4 production from the lab slurriesin creased with increasing temperature; however, the relative increases were specific to the vegetation type overlying the soils. Anaerobic to aerobic production ratios ranged from 7% (Chamaedaphne soils) to > 30% (Sphagnum soils). Ratios of potential anaerobic production (CO2 to CH4) generally decreasedwith increasing temperature. The interaction between temperature and SOM quality was demonstrated through the range of Q(10) values (1.09-2.38 for CO2; 2.98-21.40 for CH4). These measures were correlated to lignin and cellulose content and the lingo-cellulose index. Results of this study indicate the variability of greenhouse-gas fluxes from peatland soils is influenced by the SOM quality derived from the overlying vegetation. As the climate warms soil temperatures will increase rates of decomposition, and this study will improve models of temperate peatland carbon cycling and can inform land management planning by providing options for minimizing carbon loss.

AB Peatlands are one of the most important ecosystems due to their biodiversity and abundant organic compounds; therefore, it is important to observe how different plant species in peatlands react to changing environmental conditions. Sphagnum spp. are the main component of peatlands and are considered as the creator of conditions favorable for carbon storage in the form of peat. Sphagnum angustifolium and Sphagnum fallax are taxonomically very close species. To examine their adaptability to climate change, we studied the morphology and pigment content of these two species from environmental manipulation sites in Poland, where the environment was continuously manipulated for temperature and precipitation. The warming of peat was induced by using infrared heaters, whereas total precipitation was reduced by a curtain that cuts the nighttime precipitation. Morphology of S. angustifolium stayed under climate manipulation relatively stable. However, the main morphological parameters of S. fallax were significantly affected by precipitation reduction. Thus, this study indicates S. angustifolium is better adapted in comparison to S. fallax for drier and warmer conditions.

AB Projected changes in climate could shift northern peatlands from their current status as net C sinks toward that of being net C sources by changing soil temperatures and hydrology. We assessed the importance of water table and soil temperature as controls over ecosystem respiration in a bog and sedge fen in northern Minnesota, USA, by means of a manipulative mesocosm experiment. Fifty-four intact monoliths were removed from a bog and a fen and installed in insulated tanks that permitted control of the water table and were heated by overhead infrared heaters. The experimental design was a fully crossed factorial combination of two communities, three water tables, and three heat levels. Fcosystem respiration as indicated by emission of CO2 and CH4, dissolved nutrient fluxes, and productivity were measured and summarized for each growing season from 1995 to 1997.
   Seasonal ecosystem respiration (ER) as indicated by CO2 emissions responded almost exclusively to soil temperature and did not differ between community types (similar to 630 g C/ m(2)) or with water table level. These results suggest that community type, within certain limits, will not be an important factor in predicting temperature-driven increases in ER.
   The response of CH4 flux to soil temperature and water table setting became progressively stronger in each succeeding growing season. Seasonal CH4 emissions were on average three times higher in the bog than in the fen mesocosms (21 vs. 7 g C/m(2)). Aboveground net primary productivity and dissolved N retention were also higher in the bog mesocosms. There were strong correlations between CH4 flux and N retention, but generally weak correlations between CH4 and plant primary production. The relatively lower CH4 emissions from the fen mesocosms appear to result mainly from higher rates of methanotrophy in the aerated zone, possibly reinforced by the effects of higher porewater N concentrations and lower primary productivity compared to the bogs.
   The results confirm the existence of strong environmental controls over ER and methanogenesis, which are modulated by complex interactions between plant community and soil nutrient dynamics. The differential responses of these ecosystem functions to climate change may complicate efforts to predict future changes in C dynamics in these important repositories of soil C.

AB Dominant plant functional groups (PFGs) found in boreal rich fens include sedges, grasses, horsetails, and cinquefoils (obligate wetland shrubs). Precipitation regime shift and permafrost thaw due to climate change will likely trigger changes in fen plant community structure through shifts in these PFGs, and it is thus crucial to understand how these PFGs will impact carbon cycling and greenhouse gas dynamics to predict and model peatland-climate feedbacks. In this study, we detail the above and belowground effects of these PFGs on aspects of carbon cycling using a mesocosm approach. We hypothesized that PFGs capable of aerating the rhizosphere (sedges, horsetails, and grasses) would oxidize the belowground environment supporting higher redox potentials, a favorable environment for decomposition, and higher CO2:CH4 in pore water and gas efflux measurements than PFGs lacking aerenchyma (cinquefoil, unplanted control). Overall, sedges, horsetail and grasses had an oxidizing effect on rhizosphere pore water chemistry, producing an environment more favorable for methanotrophy during the growing season, as supported by an approximate isotopic enrichment of pore water methane (delta(CH4)-C-13) by 5 parts per thousand, and isotopic depletion in pore water carbon dioxide (delta(CO2)-C-13) by 10 parts per thousand, relative to cinquefoil treatments. Cinquefoil and unplanted control treatments fostered a reducing environment more favorable for methanogenesis. In addition, cinquefoil appeared to slow decomposition in comparison with the other PFGs. These findings, paired with PFG effects on oxidation-reduction potential and CO2 and CH4 production, point to the ability of rich fen plant communities to moderate biogeochemistry, specifically carbon cycling, in response to changing climatic conditions.

AB High latitude wetlands are significant sources of atmospheric methane, with emission rates that are susceptible to effects of climate change. Our data demonstrate that unlike mid-latitude wetlands, methane in northern peatlands is not derived from acetate or C-1 compounds. These latter compounds accumulate to high levels with acetate as the primary organic end product of anaerobic decomposition. Acetate is ultimately degraded aerobically to carbon dioxide after diffusion into oxic regions of peat. Therefore, organic precursors destined for methane in mid-latitude wetlands are degraded to carbon dioxide in northern wetlands. A warming-induced initiation of acetoclastic methanogenesis could substantially increase methane production.

AB Global change, like droughts, can destabilize the carbon sink function of peatlands, either directly or indirectly through changes in plant community composition. While the effects of drought and plant community composition on individual carbon (C) related processes are well understood, their effect on multiple C-related processes simultaneouslymultifunctionality-is poorly known. We studied the effect of drought on four C-related processes (net and gross CO2 exchange, methane fluxes, and dissolved organic carbon content) in a plant removal experiment. Plant functional type (PFT) removal (graminoids, herbs, Polytrichum spp., incl. combinations) negatively affected multifunctionality; most markedly when all PFTswere removed. Our results corroborate a negative drought effect on C-related multifunctionality. Drought reduced multifunctionality, and this reduction was again largest when all PFTs were removed. Our data further indicate that much of these negative drought effects were carried over and maintained from the initial removal treatment. These results suggest that while a high diversity in plant functional types is associated to high C-related multifunctionality, plant community assembly does not drive the ability of peatlands to withstand the negative impacts of drought on multifunctionality. Hence, to safeguard the carbon cycling function in intact peatlands, the effects of climate change on the functional composition of the peatland plant community needs to be minimized.

AB The balance of primary production and decomposition in northern peatlands may shift due to climate change, with potential feedbacks to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Nitrogen availability will modulate this shift, but little is known about the drivers of soil nitrogen dynamics in these environments. We used a long-term (9 years) open top chamber (OTC) experiment in an ombrotrophic Sphagnum peat bog in sub-arctic Sweden, to test for the interactive effects of spring warming, summer warming and winter snow addition on soil nitrogen fluxes, potential activities of nitrogen cycle enzymes, and soil microbial community composition. These simultaneous measurements allowed us to identify the level of organization at which climate change impacts are apparent, an important requirement for developing truly mechanistic understanding. Organic-N pools and fluxes were an order of magnitude higher than inorganic-N pools and fluxes. Summer warming approximately doubled fluxes of soil organic nitrogen and ammonia over the growing season. Such a large increase under 1 degrees C warming is unlikely to be due to kinetic effects, and we propose that it is linked to an observed seasonal decrease in microbial biomass, suggesting that N flux is driven by a substantial late-season dieback of microbes. This change in N cycle dynamics was not reflected in any of the measured potential peptidase activities. Moreover, the soil microbial community structure was apparently stable across treatments, suggesting a non-specific microbial dieback. Our results show that in these widespread peat bogs, where many plant species are capable of organic-N uptake, organic soil N dynamics are quantitatively far more important than the commonly studied inorganic-N dynamics. Understanding of climate change effects on organic soil N cycling in this system will be advanced by closer investigation of the seasonal dynamics of the microbial biomass and the input of substrates that maintain it.

AB It is widely known that peatlands are a significant carbon (C) stock. Most peatlands are located in boreal and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere but some occur also at high altitude and, contrary to the first; their contribution in terms of carbon sequestration is far less studied. In the Alps, there are numerous small peatlands, which are threatened by increasing temperatures and an alteration of their water balance. The aim of this study was to investigate the carbon fluxes of a small-scale fen in the Alps over three years (2012-2014).
   During the study period, the peatland experienced a high interannual variation in weather conditions while it acted as a carbon source based on CO2 emissions (NEE: 180.7 +/- 65.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) for all three years. This was mainly due to the short net C uptake period (73 7 days) and high respiration. Ecosystem respiration and summer gross primary production were both very high compared to other peatlands around the world and compared to a nearby low productive grassland. In wintertime, the soil did not freeze, resulting in a slow decomposition of the organic matter. Low methane fluxes were recorded during a 10-month measurement campaign, for a total of 3.2 g C-CH4 m(-2) over the December 2013-September 2014 period. Our findings suggest that the interannual variability of temperature and soil water content exert a strong influence on the carbon balance of peatlands of the Alps and that could further worsen depending upon the magnitude of climate change.

AB Global climate change has raised important questions about ecosystem resilience and the likelihood of unexpected and potentially irreversible ecosystem state shifts. Conceptual models provide a framework for generating hypotheses about long-term ecosystem processes and their responses to external perturbations. In this article, we review the classic model of autogenic peatland encroachment into closed-basin kettle lakes (terrestrialization) as well as studies that document patterns of terrestrialization that are inconsistent with this hypothesis. We then present a new conceptual model of episodic, drought-triggered terrestrialization, which is consistent with existing data and provides a mechanism by which climatic variability could cause non-linear patterns of peatland development in these ecosystems. Next, we review data from comparative studies of kettle lakes along a peatland-development gradient to explore potential ecological and biogeochemical consequences of non-linear patterns of terrestrialization. Finally, we identify research approaches that could be used to test conceptual models of terrestrialization, investigate the ecological implications of non-linear patterns of peatland development, and improve our ability to predict responses of kettle systems to climate changes of the coming decades and century.

AB Peatlands contain one-third of the world's soil carbon (C). If destabilized, decomposition of this vast C bank could accelerate climate warming; however, the likelihood of this outcome remains unknown. Here, we examine peatland C stability through five years of whole-ecosystem warming and two years of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO(2)). Warming exponentially increased methane (CH4) emissions and enhanced CH4 production rates throughout the entire soil profile; although surface CH4 production rates remain much greater than those at depth. Additionally, older deeper C sources played a larger role in decomposition following prolonged warming. Most troubling, decreases in CO2:CH4 ratios in gas production, porewater concentrations, and emissions, indicate that the peatland is becoming more methanogenic with warming. We observed limited evidence of eCO(2) effects. Our results suggest that ecosystem responses are largely driven by surface peat, but that the vast C bank at depth in peatlands is responsive to prolonged warming. One-third of Earth's carbon is sequestered in peatlands, and its stability in the face of climate change is unknown. Here the authors show that warming leads to the release of carbon as methane, but only the most prolonged warming leads to the breakdown and release of deep, old carbon.

AB Following a period of unusually strong winds and high seas in the spring of 2014, a blanket peat bog formerly covered by a beach comprised of fine sand and large rocks was uncovered at a coastal site in Spiddal, Co. Galway, Ireland. The surface of the bog was littered with standing tree stumps, the remnants of a Holocene forest that had succumbed to a relatively sudden drowning. A combination of inorganic and organic geochemical techniques was applied to determine the cause of this rapid submersion and to glean palaeoclimatic information from the preserved record within the peat. The study represents the first use of a multiproxy lipid biomarker approach to investigate palaeoclimate conditions from a peat bog in Ireland. The results provide evidence of climatic variation throughout a ca. 3400 yr timeframe during the mid-Holocene. Biomarker proxies displaying the relative contribution of Sphagnum spp. vs. higher plants were used to show changes in precipitation and temperature during peat formation. The data correlate with described events, including the 4.2 ka event and the Subboreal-Subatlantic transition and show the benefit of a lipid biomarker method for investigating Ireland's peatland resources. In particular, the indication of colder/wetter conditions coinciding with the 4.2 ka event implies the possibility that its effects were felt in Ireland, contrary to some reports. The results suggest that a combination of warm and dry conditions followed by a rapid rise in sea level led to the growth and subsequent drowning of the ancient forest landscape.

AB We reconstructed 3300 years (3500 BCE and 200 BCE) of the development history of the Rabien peatland located in central Poland, using pollen, macrofossil, testate amoebae, Cladocera, Chironomidae and geochemistry. Central Europe, particularly Poland, is characterised by a transitional climate that is influenced by continental and Atlantic air masses, which makes this region very sensitive to climate change. Our results demonstrate the high potential of the Rabien peat record to reconstruct palaeohydrological dynamics. The studied time interval is characterised by two pronounced dry periods: from similar to 2500 to similar to 1700 BCE and from similar to 700 to similar to 500 BCE, and two significant increases in the water table: from similar to 1000 to similar to 800 BCE and from similar to 500 to similar to 250 BCE. The timing of the wet shift at 600 BCE corresponds to wet periods at different sites in Central and Eastern Europe. Our investigation reveals a more complicated and complex than previously assumed set of climatic relationships in Europe between 3500 BCE and 200 BCE, which might be linked through complex teleconnections of atmospheric circulation patterns. Only reconstructions that are based on an understanding of current observations from peatlands and lake ecosystems may lead to a better interpretation of past climate changes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forty percentage of UK peatlands have been drained for agricultural use, which has caused serious peat wastage and associated greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)). In this study, we evaluated potential trade-offs between water-table management practices for minimizing peat wastage and greenhouse gas emissions, while seeking to sustain romaine lettuce production: one of the most economically relevant crop in the East Anglian Fenlands. In a controlled environment experiment, we measured lettuce yield, CO2, CH4 fluxes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from an agricultural fen soil at two temperatures (ambient and +2 degrees C) and three water-table levels (-30 cm, -40 cm and -50 cm below the surface). We showed that increasing the water table from the currently used field level of -50 cm to -40 cm and -30 cm reduced CO2 emissions, did not affect CH4 fluxes, but significantly reduced yield and increased DOC leaching. Warming of 2 degrees C increased both lettuce yield (fresh leaf biomass) and peat decomposition through the loss of carbon as CO2 and DOC. However, there was no difference in the dry leaf biomass between the intermediate (-40 cm) and the low (-50 cm) water table, suggesting that romaine lettuce grown at this higher water level should have similar energetic value as the crop cultivated at -50 cm, representing a possible compromise to decrease peat oxidation and maintain agricultural production.

AB Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions are important in the global atmospheric chemistry and their feedbacks to global warming are uncertain. Global warming is expected to trigger vegetation changes and water table drawdown in boreal peatlands, such changes have only been investigated on isoprene emission but never on other BVOCs. We aimed at distinguishing the BVOCs released from vascular plants, mosses and peat in hummocks (dry microsites) and hollows (wet microsites) of boreal peatland microcosms maintained in growth chambers. We also assessed the effect of water table drawdown (-20 cm) on the BVOC emissions in hollow microcosms. BVOC emissions were measured from peat samples underneath the moss surface after the 7-week-long experiment to investigate whether the potential effects of vegetation and water table drawdown were shown. BVOCs were sampled using a conventional chamber method, collected on adsorbent and analyzed with GC MS. In hummock microcosms, vascular plants increased the monoterpene emissions compared with the treatment where all above-ground vegetation was removed while no effect was detected on the sesquiterpenes, other reactive VOCs (ORVOCs) and other VOCs. Peat layer from underneath the surface with intact vegetation had the highest sesquiterpene emissions. In hollow microcosms, intact vegetation had the highest sesquiterpene emissions. Water table drawdown decreased monoterpene and other VOC emissions. Specific compounds could be closely associated to the natural/lowered water tables. Peat layer from underneath the surface of hollows with intact vegetation had the highest emissions of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and ORVOCs whereas water table drawdown decreased those emissions. The results suggest that global warming would change the BVOC emission mixtures from boreal peatlands following changes in vegetation composition and water table drawdown. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Changes in atmospheric temperature and lowering in water-table (WT) are expected to affect peatland nutrient dynamics. To understand the response of peatland nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics to warming and drainage in a continental wooded-bog of hummock-hollow microtopography, we compared three sites: (a) control, (b) recently drained (2-3years; experimental), and (c) older drained (12-13years; drained), during 2013. The WT was lowered at experimental and drained sites to 74 and 120cm, respectively, whereas a warming of similar to 1 degrees C was created at one half of the microforms using open-top chambers. Responses of peat total inorganic nitrogen (TIN=nitrate nitrogen [NO3--N]+ammonium nitrogen [NH4+-N]) and phosphate-P (PO43--P) pools and vegetation C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15 to the experimental treatments were investigated across sites/microforms and over time. Peat TIN available and extractable pools increased with deepening of WT and over time and were greater at hummocks relative to hollows. In contrast, the PO4 pools increased with short-term drainage but reverted to very close to their original (control) nutrient values in the longer term. The WT and warming driven change in the peat TIN pool was strongly reflected in the vascular vegetation C:N ratio and shrub C-13 and N-15, whereas moss nutrient dynamics did not vary between sites. Therefore, we suggest that atmospheric warming combined with WT deepening can increase availability of mineral N and P, which then can be reflected in vascular vegetation and hence modify the productivity and ecosystem functioning of the northern midlatitude continental wooded bogs in the long term.

AB 1. We separated the effects of plant species controls on decomposition rates from environmental controls in northern peatlands using a full factorial, reciprocal transplant experiment of eight dominant bryophytes in four distinct peatland types in boreal Alberta, Canada. Standard fractionation techniques as well as compound-specific pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry were used to identify a biochemical mechanism underlying any interspecific differences in decomposition rates.
   2. We found that over a 3-year field incubation, individual moss species and not micro-environmental conditions controlled early stages of decomposition. Across species, Sphagnum mosses exhibited a trade-off in resource partitioning into metabolic and structural carbohydrates, a pattern that served as a strong predictor of litter decomposition.
   3. Decomposition rates showed a negative co-variation between species and their microtopographic position, as species that live in hummocks decomposed slowly but hummock microhabitats themselves corresponded to rapid decomposition rates. By forming litter that degrades slowly, hummock mosses appear to promote the maintenance of macropore structure in surface peat hummocks that aid in water retention.
   4. Synthesis. Many northern regions are experiencing rapid climate warming that is expected to accelerate the decomposition of large soil carbon pools stored within peatlands. However, our results suggest that some common peatland moss species form tissue that resists decomposition across a range of peatland environments, suggesting that moss resource allocation could stabilize peatland carbon losses under a changing climate.

AB Historically, northern peatlands have functioned as a carbon sink, sequestering large amounts of soil organic carbon, mainly due to low decomposition in cold, largely waterlogged soils(1,2). The water table, an essential determinant of soil-organic-carbon dynamics(3-10), interacts with soil organic carbon. Because of the high water-holding capacity of peat and its low hydraulic conductivity, accumulation of soil organic carbon raises the water table, which lowers decomposition rates of soil organic carbon in a positive feedback loop. This two-way interaction between hydrology and biogeochemistry has been noted(3,5-8), but is not reproduced in process-based simulations(9). Here we present simulations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical soil model with peat depths that are continuously updated from the dynamic balance of soil organic carbon. Our model reproduces dynamics of shallow and deep peatlands in northern Manitoba, Canada, on both short and longer timescales. We find that the feedback between the water table and peat depth increases the sensitivity of peat decomposition to temperature, and intensifies the loss of soil organic carbon in a changing climate. In our long-term simulation, an experimental warming of 4 degrees C causes a 40% loss of soil organic carbon from the shallow peat and 86% from the deep peat. We conclude that peatlands will quickly respond to the expected warming in this century by losing labile soil organic carbon during dry periods.

AB Northern peatlands are significant stocks of terrestrial soil carbon, and it has been predicted that warmer temperatures and lower water tables resulting from climate change will convert these ecosystems into sources for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, these predictions do not consider the potential for hydrologically induced ecological succession or the spatial variability of carbon accumulation rates between different microforms in peatlands. To address these issues, the vegetation community was described, and the rates of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (R-tot) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange were determined along poor fen microtopographic gradients at a control site and at a site which experienced a water table drawdown of similar to 20 cm 8 years prior to the study (drained). Sampling plots within these sites were classified as microforms of hummocks, lawns, or hollows. The coverage of Sphagnum moss declined on drained hummocks, drained lawns were invaded by sedges, and hollows shifted from open water plots at the control site to Sphagnum-dominated plots with sparse vascular plant cover at the drained site. As a result, Rtot was significantly greater at the drained site at all microforms while maximum rates of GEP declined at drained hummocks and were enhanced at drained lawns and hollows compared to similar control microforms. These results suggest that predictions about the response of northern peatland carbon exchange to climate change must consider the interaction between ecology and hydrology and the differential responses of microforms related to their initial ecohydrological conditions.

AB High-resolution plant macrofossil records were examined alongside pollen, micro- and macro-charcoal, and testate amoeba data to elucidate the dynamics of two permafrost peatlands in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, Alaskan Arctic. The vegetation dynamics of these two peatlands were driven by autogenic processes reflecting the development trajectory of the peatlands towards ombrotrophic status, and allogenic climate change. We observe an increase in shrub pollen and macrofossils (e.g. Ericaceae, Betula nana) during two Late Holocene warm episodes and in recent decades. Pollen data suggest that regional forest cover also responded to temperature increase since ca. 1950 CE. An increase of Picea pollen (up to 13%) in the upper part of peat profile is probably associated with long distance pollen transport from populations of Picea mariana and Picea glauca located at the southern foothills of the Brooks Range. Relatively small amount of micro- and macrocharcoal in the two profiles indicates little fire activity around the sampling sites over the last ca. 2000 years, which is in agreement with regional findings. The lack of surface and groundwater influence under prolonged warmer/drier condition can allow Sphagnum to expand in Arctic peatlands. Cold climatic conditions might have been detrimental to Sphagnum populations, that were replaced by Carex spp. and other vascular plants owing to wetter conditions in the peatland.

AB Ombrotrophic raised bogs are nutrient poor acidic peatlands accumulating organic matter. They are widely spread on northern latitudes and are substantial sources of methane emissions to the atmosphere being of great concern from a climate change perspective. We investigated the methanogen community composition along microtopographic gradients within three bogs in Scandinavia, receiving different amounts of nitrogen precipitation. Methanogenic community analyses by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of the mcrA gene showed different profiles among the three sites, while no influence of the rnicrotopographic gradients was observed. Peat temperature and dissolved organic carbon were the major edaphic variables explaining 38% of the variation of the methanogenic community diversity among the bogs. The family Methanoregulaceae (hydrogenotrophic methanogens) showed the largest relative proportion and highest activity in all three sites. Quantitative PCR of the mcrA gene and transcripts showed that the most northern site, receiving the lowest atmospheric nitrogen load, had significantly lower abundance and activity of methanogens (4.7 x 10(6) and 2.4 x 10(4) mcrA copies per gram of soil, respectively), compared to the most southern site (8.2 x 10(7) and 4.6 x 10(5) mcrA copies per gram of soil, respectively), receiving the highest nitrogen load. No patterns of the mcrA gene and transcript abundances were observed along the microtopography. The results indicated that the difference in occurrence of methanogens is mainly due to geoclirnatological conditions rather than site intrinsic microtopographic variation. The study further suggests that environmental changes on the site intrinsic topography will not affect the methanogenic activity, while increasing average temperatures in Scandinavian ombrotrophic raised bogs might contribute to an increase of the methanogenic archaeal activity resulting in an increase of methane production.

AB Climate change and associated sea level rise will likely affect coastal ecosystems and lead to more frequent inundations. Plants are an important control for methane (CH4) emissions in peatlands because the metabolism of the living plant can either enhance or attenuate CH4 emissions and plant litter supplies an easily available carbon source for methanogenesis. Here we compare the contribution of various dominant plant species to methane emissions in a degraded, rewetted coastal brackish fen at the southern Baltic Sea coast in Northeast Germany. We analyse one year of bi-weekly static closed chamber data gathered at measurement spots that were located in different mono-dominant vegetation stands (Bolboschoenus maritimus (L.) Palla, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (C.C.Gmel.) Palla, Carex acutiformis Ehrh.). Furthermore, data on water level, water temperature, conductivity (sulphate), and several peat characteristics were recorded. Generally, the annual methane emissions were low with an average across vegetation stands of 14 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), which we related to high decomposition of peat after drainage and to relatively low water levels in summer. Nevertheless, methane emissions varied between different vegetation types with significantly higher methane fluxes (31.8 +/- A 5.7 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1)) from Bolboschoenus maritimus stands compared to Carex acutiformis and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani stands (4.3 +/- A 1.2 and 5.7 +/- A 2.4 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), respectively). None of the environmental variables that have been recorded can explain this difference. Thus, vegetation composition seems to be an important driver for methane emissions in coastal brackish fens and may therefore be crucial with regard to recreation measures.

AB Peatlands are among the largest reservoirs of terrestrial carbon in the northern hemisphere. Understanding how this reservoir will respond to climate changes is critical to assessing potential climate feedbacks. Peatland carbon accumulation rates (PCAR) are controlled by the difference between production and decomposition, which is affected by local and climatic factors including hydrology and temperature. To better understand how local controls can influence the response of PCAR to climate change, we investigated modern hydrology, paleohydrology, and PCAR at two nearby Sphagnum-dominated peatlands with different surficial geology (lowland and moraine settings) in Southcentral Alaska. Modern hydrological data indicated a higher rate of subsurface drainage at the lowland site, suggesting greater hydrologic sensitivity to prolonged dry periods of the past. We investigated past responses of these peatlands to well-documented climatic changes, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) at similar to 1000-600 cal yr BP and Little Ice Age (LIA) at similar to 600-200 cal yr BP, using water-table depth (WTD) inferred from testate amoebae and PCAR calculated from loss-on-ignition and C-14-dating analyses. Our results indicate that WTD and PCAR remained relatively stable at the moraine site throughout the last 1100 years, including the MCA and LIA. However, the lowland site experienced relatively stable WTD and higher PCAR during the MCA, but highly variable WTD and lower PCAR during the LIA. These differences suggest that hydrology and likely decomposition were the primary control on PCAR at these peatlands. Our results highlight the importance of local-scale controls, like surficial geology, in mediating the response of peatland hydrology and carbon accumulation to climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Most northern peatlands developed during the Holocene, sequestering large amounts of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. However, recent syntheses have highlighted the gaps in our understanding of peatland carbon accumulation. Assessments of the long-term carbon accumulation rate and possible warming-driven changes in these accumulation rates can therefore benefit from process-based modelling studies. We employed an individual-based dynamic global ecosystem model with dynamic peatland and permafrost functionalities and patch-based vegetation dynamics to quantify long-term carbon accumulation rates and to assess the effects of historical and projected climate change on peatland carbon balances across the pan-Arctic region. Our results are broadly consistent with published regional and global carbon accumulation estimates. A majority of modelled peatland sites in Scandinavia, Europe, Russia and central and eastern Canada change from carbon sinks through the Holocene to potential carbon sources in the coming century. In contrast, the carbon sink capacity of modelled sites in Siberia, far eastern Russia, Alaska and western and northern Canada was predicted to increase in the coming century. The greatest changes were evident in eastern Siberia, north-western Canada and in Alaska, where peat production hampered by permafrost and low productivity due the cold climate in these regions in the past was simulated to increase greatly due to warming, a wetter climate and higher CO2 levels by the year 2100. In contrast, our model predicts that sites that are expected to experience reduced precipitation rates and are currently permafrost free will lose more carbon in the future.

AB The impact of climate change on the greenhouse gas balance of peatlands is debated as they function both as sinks of carbon and significant sources of methane. To study redox transformations influencing methane production, we incubated two intact soil monoliths from a northern temperate fen and compared a permanently wet treatment to a treatment undergoing an experimentally induced drought for 50 days. Net turnover of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane (CH4) and electron acceptors in the saturated zone was calculated using a mass balance approach, and sulfate gross reduction rates were determined using a S-35 radiotracer. Thermodynamic energy yield of different electron accepting processes was calculated and related to the observed respiration patterns. Permanently wet conditions lead to a depletion of electron acceptors within 50 days and onset of methanogenic conditions. During drought, electron acceptors were renewed and methanogenesis was temporarily suppressed in most of the peat for another 20-50 days after rewetting. Methanogenesis began, however, apparently locally before electron acceptors were fully depleted in the remainder of the peat, and iron and sulfate reduction occurred simultaneously. Anaerobic production of DIC could mostly but not fully be explained by reduction of nitrate, sulfate and ferric iron. Sulfate gross reduction rates of up to similar to 450 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) determined with S-35-SO4 and potentially explained the surplus of 50-60 mmol m(-2) of DIC production in one treatment; however, the sulfate pools were too small to sustain such rates beyond some hours to days. Furthermore, anaerobic DIC production proceeded at constant rates after depletion of dissolved inorganic electron acceptors, although not being balanced by methane production. An unknown electron acceptor was thus consumed, and sulfate and potentially other electron acceptors recycled, either by humic substances, by aerenchymatic oxygen transport, or by oxygen in the capillary fringe at low levels of air filled porosity.

AB Rich fens are common boreal ecosystems with distinct hydrology, biogeochemistry and ecology that influence their carbon (C) balance. We present growing season soil chamber methane emission (F-CH4), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary production (GPP) fluxes from a 9-years water table manipulation experiment in an Alaskan rich fen. The study included major flood and drought years, where wetting and drying treatments further modified the severity of droughts. Results support previous findings from peatlands that drought causes reduced magnitude of growing season F-CH4, GPP and NEE, thus reducing or reversing their C sink function. Experimentally exacerbated droughts further reduced the capacity for the fen to act as a C sink by causing shifts in vegetation and thus reducing magnitude of maximum growing season GPP in subsequent flood years by similar to 15% compared to control plots. Conversely, water table position had only a weak influence on ER, but dominant contribution to ER switched from autotrophic respiration in wet years to heterotrophic in dry years. Droughts did not cause interannual lag effects on ER in this rich fen, as has been observed in several nutrient-poor peatlands. While ER was dependent on soil temperatures at 2 cm depth, F-CH4 was linked to soil temperatures at 25 cm. Inter-annual variability of deep soil temperatures was in turn dependent on wetness rather than air temperature, and higher F-CH4 in flooded years was thus equally due to increased methane production at depth and decreased methane oxidation near the surface. Short-term fluctuations in wetness caused significant lag effects on F-CH4, but droughts caused no inter-annual lag effects on F-CH4. Our results show that frequency and severity of droughts and floods can have characteristic effects on the exchange of greenhouse gases, and emphasize the need to project future hydrological regimes in rich fens.

AB Drought is usually the precursor to large wildfires in northwestern boreal Canada, a region with both large wildfire potential and extensive peatland cover. Fire is a contagious process, and given weather conducive to burning, wildfires may be naturally limited by the connectivity of fuels and the connectivity of landscapes such as peatlands. Boreal peatlands fragment landscapes when wet and connect them when dry. The aim of this paper is to construct a framework by which the hydrological dynamics of boreal peatlands can be incorporated into standard wildfire likelihood models, in this case the Canadian Burn-P3 model. We computed hydrologically dynamic vegetation cover for peatlands (37% of the study area) on a real landscape in the Canadian boreal plain, corresponding to varying water table levels representing wet, moderate, and severely dry fuel moisture and hydrological conditions. Despite constant atmospheric drivers of fire spread (air temperature, humidity, and wind speed) between drought scenarios, fire activity increased 6-fold in moderate drought relative to a low drought baseline; severe (1 in 40 years) drought scenarios drove fires into previously fire-restrictive environments. Fire size increased 5-fold during moderate drought conditions and a further 20-25% during severe drought. Future climate change is projected to lead to an increase in the incidence of severe drought in boreal forests, leading to increases in burned area due to increasing fire frequency and size where peatlands are most abundant. Future climate change in regions where peatlands have historically acted as important barriers to fire spread may amplify ongoing increases in fire activity already observed in Western North American forests.

AB Northern peatlands represent a large global carbon store that can potentially be destabilized by summer water table drawdown. Precipitation can moderate the negative impacts of water table drawdown by rewetting peatmoss (Sphagnum spp.), the ecosystem's key species. Yet, the frequency of such rewetting required for it to be effective remains unknown. We experimentally assessed the importance of precipitation frequency for Sphagnum water supply and carbon uptake during a stepwise decrease in water tables in a growth chamber.
   CO2 exchange and the water balance were measured for intact cores of three peatmoss species (Sphagnum majus, Sphagnum balticum and Sphagnum fuscum) representative of three hydrologically distinct peatland microhabitats (hollow, lawn and hummock) and expected to differ in their water table-precipitation relationships.
   Precipitation contributed significantly to peatmoss water supply when the water table was deep, demonstrating the importance of precipitation during drought. The ability to exploit transient resources was species-specific; S. fuscum carbon uptake increased linearly with precipitation frequency for deep water tables, whereas carbon uptake by S. balticum and S. majus was depressed at intermediate precipitation frequencies.
   Our results highlight an important role for precipitation in carbon uptake by peatmosses. Yet, the potential to moderate the impact of drought is species-specific and dependent on the temporal distribution of precipitation.

AB Haida Gwaii (formerly Queen Charlotte Islands) is an archipelago on the outer central coast of British Columbia. Drizzle Bog on Graham Island is a Sphagnum-dominated peatland selected for a multiproxy palaeoecological analysis using pollen, spores and other microfossils to see whether climatic changes such as the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly' (MCA), Little Ice Age' (LIA) and post-LIA warming could be detected in this hypermaritime region. A 90-cm-long Wardenaar peat core was sliced into 1-cm-thick subsamples and dated using Pb-210 back to ad 1892, and four accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates back to 1800 cal. yr BP. Low pollen accumulation rates between similar to ad 1600 and 1875 support cool growing seasons during the LIA. At 34 cm (similar to 1875), total pollen and spore accumulation rates increased dramatically, coinciding with the end of the LIA based on evidence from glacier recession in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. We suggest that the increased pollen production is likely a reflection of climatic warming and increased vegetation productivity following the LIA. Direct human impact is only apparent above 12 cm depth (similar to 1958) correlated with road building across the southwestern edge of the wetland.

AB Drought conditions are expected to increase in frequency and severity as the climate changes, representing a threat to carbon sequestered in peat soils. Downstream water treatment works are also at risk of regulatory compliance failures and higher treatment costs due to the increase in riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) often observed after droughts. More frequent droughts may also shift dominant vegetation in peatlands from Sphagnum moss to more drought-tolerant species. This paper examines the impact of drought on the production and treatability of DOC from four vegetation litters (Calluna vulgaris, Juncus effusus, Molinia caerulea and Sphagnum spp.) and a peat soil. We found that mild droughts caused a 39.6% increase in DOC production from peat and that peat DOC that had been exposed to oxygen was harder to remove by conventional water treatment processes (coagulation/flocculation). Drought had no effect on the amount of DOC production from vegetation litters; however large variation was observed between typical peatland species (Sphagnum and Calluna) and drought-tolerant grassland species (Juncus and Molinia), with the latter producing more DOC per unit weight. This would therefore suggest the increase in riverine DOC often observed post-drought is due entirely to soil microbial processes and DOC solubility rather than litter layer effects. Long-term shifts in species diversity may, therefore, be the most important impact of drought on litter layer DOC flux, whereas pulses related to drought may be observed in peat soils and are likely to become more common in the future. These results pro-vide evidence in support of catchment management which increases the resilience of peat soils to drought, such as ditch blocking to raise water tables.

AB Peatlands are one of the major sources of the powerful greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Our aim was to detect responses of methanogenic archaeal and methane-oxidizing bacterial (MOB) communities that control the methane (CH4) cycle to climatic warming. This study took place in two boreal fens three years after experimental warming in un-manipulated wet and drier regimes, thus simulating future climate scenarios. We determined active methanogen and MOB communities as transcripts of mcrA and pmoA genes, along with the abundance of these genes, CH4 production and oxidation potentials, and in situ CH4 fluxes. Methanogenic community remained similar, although methanogen abundance decreased after warming. In the wet regime, this decrease resulted in a small but significant reduction on the potential CH4 production in such peat layers where the average production potential was high. Drying alone, however, reduced the potential CH4 production more than warming, and this impact was strong enough to mask the small warming impact in the drier regime. Warming did not affect the MOB community or the potential CH4 oxidation in the wet regime; however, type Ib MOB abundance decreased and MOB related to genus Methylocapsa became typical after warming in the drier regime of the southern fen. The in situ measured CH4 fluxes indicated similar patterns as potential measurements; both warming and drying reduced methane emissions, drying more than warming. These results indicate that methanogens and MOB may have different controlling patterns on CH4 fluxes when facing global warming. These patterns may further differ not only between moisture regimes, but inside the same habitat type, here boreal fen. Irrespective of this variation, the in situ CH4 fluxes still seem to respond similarly across sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes from a Kenai Peninsula, Alaska fen spanning the late-glacial and Holocene to enhance our understanding of peatland hydrology and nutrient cycling. We find that isotopic values for carbon and nitrogen are lighter in the late-glacial and early Holocene (-28 to -34 parts per thousand and 0 to -4 parts per thousand, respectively) than the remainder of the record. The light delta C-13 value corresponds with submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation during the late-glacial, suggesting high respired carbon input. Similarly, light delta N-15 values imply that nitrogen is derived from sediment and groundwater sources. Early Holocene delta(13) values ranging from -30 parts per thousand to -34 parts per thousand infer high recycled carbon uptake from methanogenesis, related to the warm climate and the wet swale environment. A shift to heavier delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotopic values similar to 9600 cal yr BP coincides with a change in the lithology to Sphagnum-dominated peat, indicative of peat accumulation above the water table. A shift to lighter values from 5500 to 4200 cal yr BP coincides with a period of glacial recession related to warmer conditions, whereas a subsequent period of heavier values is correlative with glacial advance culminating at 3000 cal yr BP, suggesting that the hydrology of this peatland is closely linked with the glacial meltwater. delta N-15 remains near 0 parts per thousand, relatively close to the atmospheric value of delta N-15, throughout the Holocene, suggesting that the fen has been supported by N-fixation. We propose that groundwater on the Kenai lowlands was fed by subglacial meltwater, and the warm early Holocene summers resulted in high glacial ablation and groundwater recharge, sustaining a high Swanson Fen water table. Cooler temperatures resulted in a decrease of glacial meltwater input at the close of the early Holocene. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Calcareous fens in Minnesota are spring-seepage peatlands with a distinctive flora of rare calciphilic species. Feat characteristics and groundwater geochemistry were determined for six calcareous fens in the Minnesota River Basin to better understand the physical structure and chemical processes associated with stands of rare vegetation. Onset of peat accumulation in three of the fens ranged from about 4,700 to 11,000 C-14 yrs BP and probably resulted from a combination of climate change and local hydrogeologic conditions. Most peat cores had a carbonate-bearing surface zone with greater than 10% carbonates (average 27%, dry wt basis), an underlying carbonate-depleted zone with 10% or less carbonates (average 4%), and a carbonate-bearing lower zone again with greater than 10% carbonates (average 42%). This carbonate zonation was hypothesized to result from the effect of water-table level on carbonate equilibria: carbonate precipitation occurs when the water table is above a critical level, and carbonate dissolution occurs when the water table is lower. Other processes that changed the major ion concentrations in upwelling groundwater include dilution by rain water, sulfate reduction or sulfide oxidation, and ion adsorption or exchange. Geochemical modeling indicated that average shallow water in the calcareous fens during the study period was groundwater mixed with about 6 to 13% rain water. Carbonate precipitation in the surface zone of calcareous fens could be decreased by a number of human activities, especially those that lower the water table. Such changes in shallow water geochemistry could alter the growing conditions that apparently sustain rare fen vegetation.

AB This study reviews the late Holocene peatlands in Terelj River and Tuul River drainage basins in the Khentii (Khentii has been misspelled as Khentey (or Hentey) and Khentei (or Hentei) in many publications. The Khentii is the right English translation from Mongolian) Mountain Range of northeastern Mongolia. The peatlands were examined through their physical and chemical properties, diatom assemblages, and radiocarbon dating. In the Terelj River basin, the high contents of organic matter and biogenic silica and the dominant benthic diatom assemblages such as Eunotia praerupta, Pinnularia borealis, and Navicula mutica in the peat deposits indicate the warm and humid climates in the late Holocene. The high accretion rate of 0.97 mm/yr in the peatland records the intensive erosion in the surrounding landscape and deposition in the peatland due to increased precipitation and runoff in the humid climate since 0.5 cal. ka BP. In the Tuul River basin, the high content of mineral fractions and diatom assemblages dominated by benthic species Cymbella proxima, Encyonema silesiacum, and planktonic species Cyclotella ocellata in the peat deposits show a transition from humid to arid climates at 0.9 cal. ka BP. The accretion rate of 0.56 mm/yr in the peatland on the paleo-floodplain indicates strengthened erosion in the peatland over the past similar to 1000 years. This study in the southern Khentii Mountain Range provides new descriptive insights to extend the underestimated Mongolia's peat studies, and it would be a useful proof-of-concept study for future detailed paleo-environmental analyses.

AB Peatlands are one of the optimal archives for paleoclimate research and their records contain a detailed history of climatic and environmental variations during their formation. Here we collected a peat profile from the Dajiuhu basin in central China and analyzed several geochemical proxies, such as Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Nitrogen (TN), Titanium (Ti) and Aluminum (Al), to investigate the history of peat development. The results show that the peat growth was initiated after around 12.8 cal ka BP at the sampling site and the TOC and TN contents kept stable during the Holocene except during the periods of 10.5-9.0 cal ka BP and recent 1.5 cal ka BP. However, compared with other TOC records in the Dajiuhu basin, the history of peat development varied greatly in different sampling sites, indicating that the peat development in the Dajiuhu basin probably responds to both climate changes and local geological and hydrological conditions. Investigations of the interactions between climate change and peat development record in this study suggest that peat development presented significant responses to the large and rapid decreases in East Asian Summer Monsoon intensity, such as the 9.2 ka monsoon weakening event. However, the obvious long-term decreasing trend of monsoon precipitation during the mid-late Holocene did not lead to the degradation of the Dajiuhu peat, probably resulting from relatively stable temperature. In addition, the sharp decrease of TOC and TN values in the surface 15 cm of Dajiuhu peat was probably attributed to increased human activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change models predict changes in precipitation patterns over the next several decades for northern temperate regions. Resulting fluctuations of the water level may drastically affect the source-sink functions of peatlands. Here, we manipulated the water table level in an acidic, minerotrophic fen using drying and rewetting experiments to simulate summer drought and heavy rainfalls to estimate changes in peat decomposition and source-sink functions. We found that carbon dioxide (CO2) formation rates and exoenzymatic activities increased in the most active surface layer during the initial water table drawdown; however, extreme drying did not further increase these activities. Activity stimulated in deeper oxygenated peat layers did not substantially contribute to CO2 emissions. Additionally, no phenol oxidase activity was determined. Rewetting of peat after drying did not lead to a CO2 flush like in mineral soils. Water table manipulations yielded a higher availability of nitrate, ferric iron, and sulfate and prolonged the onset of methane formation. Sulfate was exported to a nearby stream. We concluded that the increasing frequency of extreme weather conditions like summer droughts and heavy rainfalls might not affect carbon storage but instead strengthen the sink function for nitrate and ferrous iron and the source function for sulfate in peatlands.

AB Continuous measurements of ecosystem scale evapotranspiration (ET) were obtained using the eddy covariance method over the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons (May-September) at three adjacent peatlands that have undergone long-term water table manipulation. The three (wet, dry and intermediate) sites represent peatlands along a hydrological gradient, with different average depths to water table (WTD) and different resulting vegetation and microform assemblages. The 2010 growing season was warmer and wetter than normal, while 2011 conditions were near normal. The difference in maximum daily ET values (95th percentiles) between sites were greater in 2010 (3.14 mm d(-1) -4.17 mm d(-1)) compared to 2011 (3.68 mm d(-1) -3.95 mm d(-1)), yielding cumulative growing season ET that followed the wet to dry gradient in both 2010 and 2011. Synoptic weather conditions (i.e. air temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and incoming solar radiation, etc.) could not explain differences in ET between sites due to their proximity to one another. Peat surface wetness was more spatially homogeneous at the wet site due to small average microtopographic variations (0.15 m) compared to the intermediate (0.30 m) and dry (0.41 m) sites. Although average Bowen ratios were less than one at all three sites, greater surface wetness and heating at the wettest site lead to differences in energy partitioning, with higher average Bowen ratios at the sites with a shallow average WTD. No significant relation between normalized ET and WTD was found at any of the sites that were consistent across both study years. In addition, the lack of a relation between ET and near-surface moisture suggests that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the boundary layer resistance created by the vascular canopy combined with low surface roughness limits evaporative losses from the peat surface. This study suggests that the low ET of a dry site compared to a wet site may be due to the impact of a long-term change in WTD on leaf area and the relative distribution of plant functional groups.

AB We compared output from 3 dynamic process-based models (DMs: ECOSSE, MILLENNIA and the Durham Carbon Model) and 9 bioclimatic envelope models (BCEMs; including BBOG ensemble and PEATSTASH) ranging from simple threshold to semi-process-based models. Model simulations were run at 4 British peatland sites using historical climate data and climate projections under a medium (A1B) emissions scenario from the 11-RCM (regional climate model) ensemble underpinning UKCP09. The models showed that blanket peatlands are vulnerable to projected climate change; however, predictions varied between models as well as between sites. All BCEMs predicted a shift from presence to absence of a climate associated with blanket peat, where the sites with the lowest total annual precipitation were closest to the presence/absence threshold. DMs showed a more variable response. ECOSSE predicted a decline in net C sink and shift to net C source by the end of this century. The Durham Carbon Model predicted a smaller decline in the net C sink strength, but no shift to net C source. MILLENNIA predicted a slight overall increase in the net C sink. In contrast to the BCEM projections, the DMs predicted that the sites with coolest temperatures and greatest total annual precipitation showed the largest change in carbon sinks. In this model inter-comparison, the greatest variation in model output in response to climate change projections was not between the BCEMs and DMs but between the DMs themselves, because of different approaches to modelling soil organic matter pools and decomposition amongst other processes. The difference in the sign of the response has major implications for future climate feedbacks, climate policy and peatland management. Enhanced data collection, in particular monitoring peatland response to current change, would significantly improve model development and projections of future change.

AB The impact climate and land-use changes have on the hydrological conditions in peat bogs and lakes is often complex, but of great importance for the carbon budget and biodiversity in these ecosystems. Links and feed-backs between raised bog water table depth, lake level, net precipitation, hydrometeorological indices, and radial tree growth have been studied and identified in the Rekyva wetland complex, Lithuania. Moreover, several statistically significant correlations between raised bog water table depths, lake level, local river runoff, and tree growth were observed. The changes of raised bog water table, lake level, and tree growth show synchronous trends despite variations in the absolute values. Our results show decreasing water table in the Rekyva wetland complex over the last 100 years, especially in the middle of the 20th century. This study also shows a potential for reconstructing water table fluctuations in wetland complexes using multi-indicator approaches. Our observations and reconstruction show consistency with several regional studies and reconstructions of moisture variations in Baltic raised bogs, at least for periods without strong anthropogenic influences.

AB Climate warming in high-latitude regions is thawing carbon-rich permafrost soils, which can release carbon to the atmosphere and enhance climate warming. Using a coupled model of long-term peatland dynamics (Holocene Peat Model, HPM-Arctic), we quantify the potential loss of carbon with future climate warming for six sites with differing climates and permafrost histories in Northwestern Canada. We compared the net carbon balance at 2100 CE resulting from new productivity and the decomposition of active layer and newly thawed permafrost peats under RCP8.5 as a high-end constraint. Modeled net carbon losses ranged from -3.0 kg C m(-2) (net loss) to +0.1 kg C m(-2) (net gain) between 2015 and 2100. Losses of newly thawed permafrost peat comprised 0.2%-25% (median: 1.6%) of "old" C loss, which were related to the residence time of peat in the active layer before being incorporated into the permafrost, peat temperature, and presence of permafrost. The largest C loss was from the permafrost-free site, not from permafrost sites. C losses were greatest from depths of 0.2-1.0 m. New C added to the profile through net primary productivity between 2015 and 2100 offset similar to 40% to >100% of old C losses across the sites. Differences between modeled active layer deepening and flooding following permafrost thaw resulted in very small differences in net C loss by 2100, illustrating the important role of present-day conditions and permafrost aggradation history in controlling net C loss.

AB Impacts of warming with open-top chambers on microbial communities in wet conditions and in conditions resulting from moderate water-level drawdown (WLD) were studied across 0-50 cm depth in northern and southern boreal sedge fens. Warming alone decreased microbial biomass especially in the northern fen. Impact of warming on microbial PLFA and fungal ITS composition was more obvious in the northern fen and linked to moisture regime and sample depth. Fungal-specific PLFA increased in the surface peat in the drier regime and decreased in layers below 10 cm in the wet regime after warming. OTUs representing Tomentella and Lactarius were observed in drier regime and Mortierella in wet regime after warming in the northern fen. The ectomycorrhizal fungi responded only to WLD. Interestingly, warming together with WLD decreased archaeal 16S rRNA copy numbers in general, and fungal ITS copy numbers in the northern fen. Expectedly, many results indicated that microbial response on warming may be linked to the moisture regime. Results indicated that microbial community in the northern fen representing Arctic soils would be more sensitive to environmental changes. The response to future climate change clearly may vary even within a habitat type, exemplified here by boreal sedge fen.

AB Northern peatlands have accumulated one third of the Earth's soil carbon stock since the last Ice Age. Rapid warming across northern biomes threatens to accelerate rates of peatland ecosystem respiration. Despite compensatory increases in net primary production, greater ecosystem respiration could signal the release of ancient, century- to millennia-old carbon from the peatland organic matter stock. Warming has already been shown to promote ancient peatland carbon release, but, despite the key role of vegetation in carbon dynamics, little is known about how plants influence the source of peatland ecosystem respiration. Here, we address this issue using insitu(14)C measurements of ecosystem respiration on an established peatland warming and vegetation manipulation experiment. Results show that warming of approximately 1 degrees C promotes respiration of ancient peatland carbon (up to 2100years old) when dwarf-shrubs or graminoids are present, an effect not observed when only bryophytes are present. We demonstrate that warming likely promotes ancient peatland carbon release via its control over organic inputs from vascular plants. Our findings suggest that dwarf-shrubs and graminoids prime microbial decomposition of previously locked-up' organic matter from potentially deep in the peat profile, facilitating liberation of ancient carbon as CO2. Furthermore, such plant-induced peat respiration could contribute up to 40% of ecosystem CO2 emissions. If consistent across other subarctic and arctic ecosystems, this represents a considerable fraction of ecosystem respiration that is currently not acknowledged by global carbon cycle models. Ultimately, greater contribution of ancient carbon to ecosystem respiration may signal the loss of a previously stable peatland carbon pool, creating potential feedbacks to future climate change.

AB In the near future, climate change will increasingly affect export of carbon (C) from peatlands. Terminal mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a source of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, CO2, and methane, CH4) for the atmosphere, and may contribute to climatic warming. Quantitative understanding of sources, dispersion pathways, and degradation of DOC produced in peat bogs is important for predictions of global change dynamics. Here we explore the potential of combining C isotope ratios of isotopically stratified, Pb-210-dated peat deposits and C isotope ratios of DOC exported via runoff to determine the depth and age of the predominant DOC source. In a poorly drained, Sphagnum-derived peat bog in the Czech Republic, delta C-13 values of bulk peat increased downcore to a depth of 10 cm. The C isotope signatures of fresh DOC and bulk peat differ only insignificantly, because C isotope changes in maturating peat require multiple microbial modifications of the organic matter taking place over relatively long time periods. Based on 41 samplings of runoff, 70% of exported DOC originated from peat substrate 1 to 10 years old, 2-10 cm deep. Recently photosynthesized DOC (< 1 year old) contributed about 5% to runoff DOC, whereas approximately 25% of exported DOC was derived from peat layers older than 10 years. Because biogenic methane at the study site contained isotopically extremely light C (delta C-13 values of -64.2 to -53.2 parts per thousand), it would seem reasonable to expect residual DOC following partial decomposition to become isotopically heavier. A short-term laboratory incubation of wet peat samples from four depths at mid-summer temperatures indicated more complicated delta C-13 systematics. The initial limited amount of DOC in the leachate was isotopically heavy, compared to bulk peat, but after 18 days delta C-13(DOC) became lower, converging to the C isotope signature of bulk peat. Such delta C-13 systematics can be explained by multi-step isotope effects associated with different reaction rates during substrate decomposition. Limitations of using the combination of within-bog delta C-13 systematics and Pb-210 dating of recent peat accretion are discussed. Horizontal heterogeneity in substrate C isotope signatures is one of the main sources of uncertainty of this approach to DOC source apportionment in peaty soils.

AB Peatlands, which are dominant features of the Canadian landscape, cover approximately 1.13 6 million km(2), or 12% of the land area. Most of the peatlands (97%) occur in the Boreal Weiland Region (64%) and Subarctic Wetland Region (33%). Because of the large area they cover and their high organic carbon content, these peatlands contain approximately 147 Gt soil carbon, which is about 56% of the organic carbon stored in all Canadian soils.
   A model for estimating peatland sensitivity to climate warming was used to determine both the sensitivity ratings of various peatland areas and the associated organic carbon masses. Calculations show that approximately 60% of the total area of Canadian peatlands and 51% of the organic carbon mass in all Canadian peatlands is expected to be severely to extremely severely affected by climate change.
   The increase in average annual air temperature of 3-5 degrees C over land and 5-7 degrees C over the oceans predicted for northern Canada by the end of this century would result in the degradation of frozen peatlands in the Subarctic and northern Boreal wetland regions and severe drying in the southern Boreal Weiland Region. In addition, flooding of coastal peatlands is expected because of the predicted rise in sea levels. As a result of these changes, a large part of the carbon in the peatlands expected to be severely and extremely severely affected by climate change could be released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which will further increase climate warming.

AB 1. Effects of climate change may affect the Sphagnum species composition in bogs, and ultimately the functioning of the whole ecosystem. We investigated the effect of different water tables on the competition between six Sphagnum species in the glasshouse. The amount of precipitation (234 mm year(-1)) and precipitation frequency (every 2 weeks) were kept low to encourage water-table effects. Relevant species combinations and monocultures were grown at different water tables for a 16-month period. We studied changes in cover, height increment and capitulum water content (WCcap) in order to understand competitive responses.
   2. Species naturally occurring further above the water table generally showed higher competitive strength than species naturally occurring closer to the water table. Surprisingly, this effect was irrespective of the water table, indicating a minor role for capillary water transport. Cover change seemed to be related to differences in length growth, but not to water table or WCcap.
   3. The WCcap of species within a mixture did not differ, but was lower than the WCcap of the individual species growing in monoculture, indicating differences in ability to supply water to the capitula between mono- and mixed cultures. Subcapitulum bulk densities between mono- and mixed cultures did not differ, or were even lower in monocultures, but did differ between species within mixed cultures.
   4. Our results indicate that structural heterogeneity of the peat in mixed cultures has a negative effect on WCcap of both species. Furthermore, we show that sustained periods of drought cause species that naturally occur further above the water table to oust species that naturally occur closer to the water table, even if the water table remains high. Ultimately, the Sphagnum vegetation in raised bogs may shift from hollow to hummock species, evening out the natural microtopography of raised bogs.

AB Mountain peatlands in the temperate regions represent a small proportion of the global peatland resource, but play a unique, although less recognized role in the regional water and biogeochemical cycles. We conducted leaf and ecosystem CO2 exchange measurements during the growing period of 2008 to investigate the effects of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and ground water level (WL) on leaf gas exchange of two dominant herbaceous species, Molinia caerulea (L.) and Carex nigra (L.) in a mountain peatland. Implications of the leaf-level responses for net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were examined. Fluctuations in WL influenced soil water content (SWC) within the top 5 cm of the peat profile. Although midday leaf water potential during the day (I-md) was positively correlated (P < 0.001) with SWC in the 5 cm peat profile, there was no direct relationship between WL and plant water relations parameters. VPD and stomatal conductance (gs) were negatively correlated at VPD > 1 kPa regardless of the current WL status. Stomatal conductance was positively correlated with leaf assimilation (A) and root-shoot hydraulic conductance (Ks-l). A decline in NEE during summer was attributed to stomatal closure due to high VPD and low light utilization efficiency (alpha) of the vegetation. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was positively correlated with peat temperature at 10 cm depth. Our results suggest that increases in VPD, as a possible scenario of climate change, would lower the photosynthetic capacity of the herbaceous peatland vegetation, despite the high WL, and hence lower the potential of such peatlands as sinks for atmospheric CO2.

Palsa mires have high conservation Status, being characterized by a rich diversity of bird species and unique geomorphological processes. They are currently degrading throughout their distributional range, probably because of regional climatic warming. Distributions of palsas in Fermoscandia were modelled using 5 climate envelope techniques (generalized linear modelling, generalized additive modelling, classification tree analysis, artificial neural networks and multiple adaptive regression splines). The models were studied with respect to their sensitivity to altered climate. Climate change scenarios were applied to assess possible impacts on the palsa distribution during the 21st century. The models achieved a good to very good agreement with the observed palsa distribution and thus suggest a strong dependency on climate. Even small increases of temperature (1 degrees C) and precipitation (10%) resulted in considerable losses of areas suitable for palsa development. Of the 5 models tested, 3 predicted the total disappearance of regions suitable for palsa development with an increased mean annual temperature of VC. Under climate change scenarios based on 7 Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) the models indicated that the degradation of palsas will proceed very quickly. All but one climate scenario resulted in the total disappearance of suitable regions for palsa development by the end of the 21st century. Potential impacts of degrading palsa mires on biodiversity and carbon balance are the loss of habitat for migrating bird species and the increase in CH4 emissions.

AB Pollen and non-pollen palynomorph data are presented from two radiocarbon-dated ombrotrophic peat bogs from the Xistral Mountains in the North Western Iberian Peninsula. The results suggest that vegetation changes over the last five millennia are the result of human disturbance and climate change. Four major periods of forest disturbance are recorded: during the Late Neolithic, Metal Ages, Roman period and culminating in the permanent decline of deciduous forests since the Middle Ages, as agriculture and metallurgy intensified. Records of non-pollen palynomorphs, particularly those derived from fungi, proved to be useful indicators of climate change and human activity. Discriminant and cluster analysis suggest that trends in certain pollen and NPP reflect changes in humidity and to a lesser extent temperature. Cyperaceae and Types 18 and 18b increase during more humid, wet phases, whilst Type 306 increases during drier phases. Various ascospores, derived from coprophilous fungi, complement changes in pollen taxa to infer human activity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organic matter decomposition in response to thawing permafrost has critical implications for carbon release. This study examined how thaw induced plant community and environmental changes influenced litter and peat decomposition in a subarctic peatland.
   We conducted laboratory incubations under current site pre-thaw (dry and large oxic peat layer) and thawed (wet and small oxic peat layer) conditions, and mimiced pond thaw conditions (water saturated and anoxic) at 4 and 22 A degrees C. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) releases from ground surface plant litter and top 1 m peat samples at permafrost area (Palsa) and wet thawed lawn (WL) were quantified under current site conditions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from litter was additionally quantified under pond thaw conditions.
   Plant litter mass significantly increased from Palsa to WL. Under current site conditions, litter in WL had significantly higher CO2 and CH4 production rates than litter in Palsa. Pond thaw conditions changed litter carbon loss partitioning into lower CO2 but higher DOC and CH4 production, and increased total carbon release. Whole peat decomposition was restricted from Palsa to WL with thaw. Estimated growing season gas carbon loss (CO2 and CH4) in WL was greater than that in Palsa due to significantly increased litter carbon loss after thaw.
   Changes in organic matter decomposition, especially litter decomposition, enlarged carbon losses from this subarctic peatland with permafrost thaw.

AB Emissions of CH4, CO2 and N2O from peat land soil have important implications for the atmospheric greenhouse gases balance. Till now, little is known about the patterns and controls of greenhouse gas from peatland soil where lied by permafrost in Northeast China. In the present study, soil GHG fluxes were observed over three years from a peatland in Great Hing'an Mountains. The results show that pronounced seasonal variation was observed in soil CH4 and CO2 fluxes during the measurement periods, but was not appeared in soil N2O fluxes. Seasonal dynamics of CO? emissions were strongly regulated by air temperature and soil temperature at 5 cm. On seasonal scale, the Q(10) of soil CO2 in spring was much higher than other seasons, which implied more CO2 emission to atmosphere under spring warming. We also found a negative relationship between soil CO2 fluxes and water table depth, with the emissions decreasing as water table approach to soil surface. The annual emissions of greenhouse gas from peatland soil were 641.13 g m(-2) yr(-1) for CO2, 0.65 g m(-2) yr(-1) for CH4 and 29.7 mg m(-2) yr(-1) for N2O, respectively. Our results suggest that peatland soil CO2 emission was more sensitive to climate change, especially warming.

AB Widespread changes in arctic and boreal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values captured by satellite platforms indicate that northern ecosystems are experiencing rapid ecological change in response to climate warming. Increasing temperatures and altered hydrology are driving shifts in ecosystem biophysical properties that, observed by satellites, manifest as long-term changes in regional NDVI. In an effort to examine the underlying ecological drivers of these changes, we used field-scale remote sensing of NDVI to track peatland vegetation in experiments that manipulated hydrology, temperature, and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. In addition to NDVI, we measured percent cover by species and leaf area index (LAI). We monitored two peatland types broadly representative of the boreal region. One site was a rich fen located near Fairbanks, Alaska, at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX), and the second site was a nutrient-poor bog located in Northern Minnesota within the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. We found that NDVI decreased with long-term reductions in soil moisture at the APEX site, coincident with a decrease in photosynthetic leaf area and the relative abundance of sedges. We observed increasing NDVI with elevated temperature at the SPRUCE site, associated with an increase in the relative abundance of shrubs and a decrease in forb cover. Warming treatments at the SPRUCE site also led to increases in the LAI of the shrub layer. We found no strong effects of elevated CO2 on community composition. Our findings support recent studies suggesting that changes in NDVI observed from satellite platforms may be the result of changes in community composition and ecosystem structure in response to climate warming.

AB Freezing characteristics were investigated for a sedge covered floating fen and spruce covered swamp located beside a shallow lake in the Western Boreal Forest of Canada. Thermal properties were measured in situ for one freeze-thaw cycle, and for two freeze-thaw cycles in laboratory columns. Thermal conductivity and liquid water content were related to a range of subsurface temperatures above and below the freezing thresholds, and clearly illustrate hysteresis between the freezing and thawing process. Thermal hysteresis occurs because of the large change in thermal conductivity between water and ice, high water content of the peat, and wide variation in pore sizes that govern ice formation. Field and laboratory results were combined to develop linear freezing functions, which were tested in a heat transfer model. For surface temperature boundary conditions, subsurface temperatures were simulated for the over-winter period and compared with field measurements. Replication of the transient subsurface thermal regime required that freezing functions transition gradually from thawed to frozen state (spanning the -0.25 to -2 degrees C range) as opposed to a more abrupt step function. Subsurface temperatures indicate that the floating fen underwent complete phase change (from water to ice) and froze to approximately the same depth as lake ice thickness. Therefore, the floating fen peatland froze as a 'shelf' adjacent to the lake, whereas the spruce covered swamp had a higher capacity for thermal buffering, and subsurface freezing was both more gradual and limited in depth. These thermal properties, and the timing and duration of frozen state, are expected to control the interaction of water and nutrients between surface water and groundwater, which will be affected by changes in air temperature associated with global climate change.

AB Northern peatlands store similar to 30% of the world's soil carbon. This carbon sequestration is due to slow decomposition, as illustrated by ancient wooden artefacts and 'bog bodies' preserved over millennia. Such artefacts suggest that carbon could be captured externally and stored long term in peat. However, whether such carbon would remain stable following lowered water tables is not known. Here, we show that adding woody litter results in preservation of the exogenous carbon, as well as protection of soil carbon within the host ecosystem from severe drought, as a result of leached polyphenolics. These compounds not only inhibit microbial extracellular and intracellular metabolism but also deprive microbial growth of iron and substrates such as carbon and nitrogen. Our results suggest that this technique harnesses natural ecosystem resilience mechanisms and may have implications for new carbon-farming approaches.

AB Peatlands contain a globally significant store (30%) of soil carbon (C). Within the Canadian Western Boreal Plains, where peatlands are a dominant feature, the climate is becoming warmer and drier, coupled with an increase in forest fire incidence. The response of peatlands to forest fire is likely to be a key determinant in the future of C storage of Boreal peatlands. This study examined the impacts of fire on key environmental controls on CO2 fluxes at the plot-scale (using static chambers) between burned and unburned understory vegetation throughout the growing season of 2017 in a treed fen impacted by the Horse River wildfire (2016) in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Both gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and total respiration (R-tot) were less at burned plots compared with unburned. Temporal patterns varied between the plots, where both component of CO2 fluxes at the unburned plots were largest in June, whereas at the burned plots, CO2 fluxes peaked in the late growing season. GEP and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) showed a positive relationship with depth of burn, with the deepest burned areas showing significantly greater CO2 uptake(,) coinciding with both increased bioavailable phosphorus and greater moss recolonization. At the unburned plots, soil temperature was a dominant control on CO2 fluxes. This work demonstrates the importance of the depth of burn to post-fire carbon fluxes and how a knowledge of burn severity and depth can inform understanding of the recovery trajectory of northern peatlands following fire disturbance.

AB The fate of Northern peatlands under climate change is important because of their contribution to global carbon (C) storage. Peatlands are maintained via greater plant productivity (especially of Sphagnum species) than decomposition, and the processes involved are strongly mediated by climate. Although some studies predict that warming will relax constraints on decomposition, leading to decreased C sequestration, others predict increases in productivity and thus increases in C sequestration. We explored the lack of congruence between these predictions using single-species and integrated species distribution models as proxies for understanding the environmental correlates of North American Sphagnum peatland occurrence and how projected changes to the environment might influence these peatlands under climate change. Using Maximum entropy and BIOMOD modelling platforms, we generated single and integrated species distribution models for four common Sphagnum species in North America under current climate and a 2050 climate scenario projected by three general circulation models. We evaluated the environmental correlates of the models and explored the disparities in niche breadth, niche overlap, and climate suitability among current and future models. The models consistently show that Sphagnum peatland distribution is influenced by the balance between soil moisture deficit and temperature of the driest quarter-year. The models identify the east and west coasts of North America as the core climate space for Sphagnum peatland distribution. The models show that, at least in the immediate future, the area of suitable climate for Sphagnum peatland could expand. This result suggests that projected warming would be balanced effectively by the anticipated increase in precipitation, which would increase Sphagnum productivity.

AB Based on theories of mire development and responses to a changing climate, the current role of mires as a net carbon sink has been questioned. A rigorous evaluation of the current net C-exchange in mires requires measurements of all relevant fluxes. Estimates of annual total carbon budgets in mires are still very limited. Here, we present a full carbon budget over 2 years for a boreal minerogenic oligotrophic mire in northern Sweden (64 degrees 11'N, 19 degrees 33'E). Data on the following fluxes were collected: land-atmosphere CO2 exchange (continuous Eddy covariance measurements) and CH4 exchange (static chambers during the snow free period); TOC (total organic carbon) in precipitation; loss of TOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 through stream water runoff (continuous discharge measurements and regular C-concentration measurements). The mire constituted a net sink of 27 +/- 3.4 (+/- SD) g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 20 +/- 3.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. This could be partitioned into an annual surface-atmosphere CO2 net uptake of 55 +/- 1.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 48 +/- 1.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. The annual NEE was further separated into a net uptake season, with an uptake of 92 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 86 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005, and a net loss season with a loss of 37 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. Of the annual net CO2-C uptake, 37% and 31% was lost through runoff (with runoff TOC > DIC >> CH4) and 16% and 29% through methane emission during 2004 and 2005, respectively. This mire is still a significant C-sink, with carbon accumulation rates comparable to the long-term Holocene C-accumulation, and higher than the C-accumulation during the late Holocene in the region.

AB Questions: What are the long-term effects of climate change on the plant species composition and carbon sequestration in peat bogs?
   Methods: We developed a bog ecosystem model that includes vegetation, carbon, nitrogen and water dynamics. Two groups of vascular plant species and three groups of Sphagnum species compete with each other for light and nitrogen. The model was tested by comparing the outcome with long-term historic vegetation changes in peat cores from Denmark and England. A climate scenario was used to analyse the future effects of atmospheric CO2, temperature and precipitation.
   Results: The main changes in the species composition since 1766 were simulated by the model. Simulations for a future warmer, and slightly wetter, climate with doubling CO2 concentration suggest that little will change in species composition, due to the contrasting effects of increasing temperatures ( favouring vascular plants) and CO2 ( favouring Sphagnum). Further analysis of the effects of temperature showed that simulated carbon sequestration is negatively related to vascular plant expansion. Model results show that increasing temperatures may still increase carbon accumulation at cool, low N deposition sites, but decrease carbon accumulation at high N deposition sites.
   Conclusions: Our results show that the effects of temperature, precipitation, N-deposition and atmospheric CO2 are not straightforward, but interactions between these components of global change exist. These interactions are the result of changes in vegetation composition. When analysing long-term effects of global change, vegetation changes should be taken into account and predictions should not be based on temperature increase alone.

AB This study deals with changes in the plant cover and its net carbon sequestration over 30 years on a subarctic Sphagnum-mire with permafrost near Abisko, northernmost Sweden, in relation to climatic variations during the same period. Aerial colour infrared images from 1970 and 2000 were compared to reveal changes in surface structure and vegetation over the whole mire, while the plant populations were studied within a smaller, mainly ombrotrophic part. The results demonstrated two processes, namely (1) that wet sites dominated by graminoids expanded while hummock sites dominated by dwarf shrubs receded, and (2) that on the hummocks lichens expanded while evergreen dwarf shrubs and mosses decreased, both processes creating an instability in the surface structure. A successive degradation of the permafrost is the likely reason for the increase in wet areas, while the changes in the hummock vegetation might have resulted from higher spring temperatures giving rise to an intensified snow melt, exposing the vegetation to frost drought. Because of the vegetation changes, the annual litter input of carbon to the mire has increased slightly, by 4 g m(-2) a(-1) (7.3%), over these years while an increased erosion has resulted in a loss of 40-80 Mg carbon or 7-17 g m(-2) a(-1) for the entire mire over the same period. As the recalcitrant proportion of the litter has decreased, the decay rate in the acrotelm might be expected to increase in the future.

AB To determine the influence of fire and thermokarst in a boreal landscape, we investigated peat cores within and adjacent to a permafrost collapse feature on the Tanana River Floodplain of Interior Alaska. Radioisotope dating, diatom assemblages, plant macrofossils, charcoal fragments, and carbon and nitrogen content of the peat profile indicate similar to 600 years of vegetation succession with a transition from a terrestrial forest to a sedge-dominated wetland over 100 years ago, and to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland in approximately 1970. The shift from sedge to Sphagnum, and a decrease in the detrended tree-ring width index of black spruce trees adjacent to the collapse coincided with an increase in the growing season temperature record from Fairbanks. This concurrent wetland succession and reduced growth of black spruce trees indicates a step-wise ecosystem-level response to a change in regional climate. In 2001, fire was observed coincident with permafrost collapse and resulted in lateral expansion of the peatland. These observations and the peat profile suggest that future warming and/or increased fire disturbance could promote permafrost degradation, peatland expansion, and increase carbon storage across this landscape; however, the development of drought conditions could reduce the success of both black spruce and Sphagnum, and potentially decrease the long-term ecosystem carbon storage.

AB Peatlands are an important global carbon reservoir. The continued accumulation of carbon in peatlands depends on the persistence of anoxic conditions, in part induced by water saturation, which prevents oxidation of organic matter, and slows down decomposition. Here we investigate how and over what time scales the hydrological regime impacts the geochemistry and the bacterial community structure of temperate peat soils. Peat cores from two sites having contrasting groundwater budgets were subjected to four controlled drought-rewetting cycles. Pore water geochemistry and metagenomic profiling of bacterial communities showed that frequent water table drawdown induced lower concentrations of dissolved carbon, higher concentrations of sulfate and iron and reduced bacterial richness and diversity in the peat soil and water. Short-term drought cycles (3-9 day frequency) resulted in different communities from continuously saturated environments. Furthermore, the site that has more frequently experienced water table drawdown during the last two decades presented the most striking shifts in bacterial community structure, altering biogeochemical functioning of peat soils. Our results suggest that the increase in frequency and duration of drought conditions under changing climatic conditions or water resource use can induce profound changes in bacterial communities, with potentially severe consequences for carbon storage in temperate peatlands.

AB Boreal peatlands represent a large global carbon pool. The relationships between carbon mineralization, soil temperature and moisture in the permafrost peatlands of the Great Hing'an Mountains, China, were examined. The CO2 emissions were measured during laboratory incubations of samples from four sites under different temperatures (5, 10, 15, and 20 degrees C) and moisture contents (0%, 30%, 60%, 100% water holding capacity (WHC) and completely water saturated). Total carbon mineralization ranged from 15.51 to 112.92 mg C under the treatments for all sites. Carbon mineralization rates decreased with soil depth, increased with temperature, and reached the highest at 60% WHC at the same temperature. The calculated temperature coefficient (Q(10)) values ranged from 1.84 to 2.51 with the soil depths and moisture. However, the values were not significantly affected by soil moisture and depth for all sites due to the different peat properties (P > 0.05). We found that the carbon mineralization could be successfully predicted as a two-compartment function with temperature and moisture (R-2 > 0.96) and total carbon mineralization was significantly affected by temperature and moisture (P < 0.05). Thus, temperature and moisture would play important roles in carbon mineralization of permafrost peatlands in the Great Hing'an Mountains, indicating that the permafrost peatlands would be sensitive to the environment change, and the permafrost peatlands would be potentially mineralized under future climate change.

AB We use a network of cores from 77 peatland sites to determine controls on peat C content and peat C accumulation over the last 2000 years ( since 2 ka) across Russia's West Siberian Lowland (WSL), the world's largest wetland region. Our results show a significant influence of fossil plant composition on peat C content, with peats dominated by Sphagnum having a lower C content. Radiocarbon-derived C accumulation since 2 ka at 23 sites is highly variable from site to site, but displays a significant N-S trend of decreasing accumulation at higher latitudes. Northern WSL peatlands show relatively small C accumulation of 7 to 35 kg C m(-2) since 2 ka. In contrast, peatlands south of 60 degrees N show larger accumulation of 42 to 88 kg C m(-2). Carbon accumulation since 2 ka varies significantly with modern mean annual air temperature, with maximum C accumulation found between -1 and 0 degrees C. Rates of apparent C accumulation since 2 ka show no significant relationship to long-term Holocene averages based on total C accumulation. A GIS-based extrapolation of our site data suggests that a substantial amount (similar to 40%) of total WSL peat C has accumulated since 2 ka, with much of this accumulation south of 60 degrees N. The large peatlands in the southern WSL may be an important component of the Eurasian terrestrial C sink, and future warming could result in a shift northward in long-term WSL C sequestration.

AB To compare growth variability of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on different soil types, and to assess the potential of peat-soil pines for climatological and hydrological studies.
   We used extensive dendrochronological analyses to investigate temporal and spatial responses of pines growing on peat soils and mineral soils in three regions of Lithuania.
   Significant correlations were observed between tree populations growing on similar soil types in different geographical regions, whereas synchronicity was absent between neighbouring stands growing on different soil types. At mineral soils, tree growth was significantly correlated with winter and early summer temperatures, whereas a more complex response was detected in peat-soil trees, presumably reflecting a multi-annual synthesis of moisture variability and changing hydrology. Synchronous long-term peat soil tree-growth variations observed over large parts of the Baltics point to a possible regional hydrological forcing. Our results may therefore improve hydrological reconstructions using living and subfossil peat-soil trees, and could be of prime importance given the major influence peatland water-table fluctuations have on a range of environmental processes.
   Results reveal that peat-soil pines are unsuitable for high-frequency climate reconstruction, but demonstrate their potential for the reconstruction of multi-annual to decadal hydrological fluctuations. Mineral-soil pines, by contrast, should be used for temperature reconstructions.

AB Peatlands contain around one third of the global soil carbon (C) and play an important role in the C cycle. In particular, the response of the productivity-decay balance to climate variability is critical for understanding both the past and future global C cycle. Most studies of peatland C dynamics have been carried out on boreal and subarctic peatlands, where climate models predict a greater increase in temperature compared to the global average. Less is known about peatlands at lower latitudes, yet there are significant peatland C stocks in these regions that may be more vulnerable to future climate change because they are closer to the climatic limit of peatland distribution. Northeast China is China's largest wetland region, with extensive peatlands in mountain regions and across the plains. Here, we used core data from 134 peatland sites to quantify the C accumulation rate over different timescales and estimate C storage across northeast China. The results show that the Holocene long-term apparent rate of C accumulation (LORCA) ranged from 5.74 to 129.31 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with a mean rate of 33.66 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The total wetland area and C storage within this region is 82,870 km(2) and 4.34 Gt C, and about 80% of the C is contained in mountain peatlands. We find that total C accumulated over the last 2000 years is linearly related to photosynthetically active radiation over the growing season, supporting the hypothesis that rates of net primary productivity (NPP) are more important than decomposition rates in determining long-term C accumulation. Although peatlands in northeast China are close to the southern limit of major peatland extent, our data suggest that future warming will lead to greater future C accumulation, as long as moisture balance or cloudiness do not become limiting factors.

AB Peatlands cover 12% (1.136 million km(2)) of the land area of Canada, with perennially frozen peatlands covering 37% of this area and peatlands of the Boreal and Subarctic regions covering 97%. In total, these peatlands contain approximately 147 Gt of soil organic carbon, which is about 56% of the organic carbon stored in all Canadian soils. Climate change predictions suggest that the average annual air temperature in northern Canada will increase 3-5 degrees C by the end of this century. A peatland sensitivity model was used to determine the effect of climate warming on these peatlands. This model predicts that approximately 60% of the area and 56% of the organic carbon mass in all Canadian peatlands will be severely to extremely severely affected by climate change. Although peatlands were affected by climate change in the past, the changes occurred at a slower rate than is predicted for the current change of climate. This accelerated rate of climate change will result in serious degradation of perennially frozen peatlands in the Subarctic and Boreal regions and severe drying of peatlands in the southern portions of the Boreal Region. As a result of these changes, large amounts of carbon in the forms of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane (CH(4)) will be released into the atmosphere from these peatlands. This will further accelerate climate warming.

AB Boreal peatlands store large amounts of carbon, reflecting their important role in the global carbon cycle. The short-term exchange and the long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in these ecosystems are closely associated with the permanently wet surface conditions and are susceptible to drought. Especially, the single most important peat forming plant genus, Sphagnum, depends heavily on surface wetness for its primary production. Changes in rainfall patterns are expected to affect surface wetness, but how this transient rewetting affects net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) remains unknown. This study explores how the timing and characteristics of rain events during photosynthetic active periods, that is daytime, affect peatland NEE and whether rain event associated changes in environmental conditions modify this response (e.g. water table, radiation, vapour pressure deficit, temperature). We analysed an 11-year time series of half-hourly eddy covariance and meteorological measurements from Degero Stormyr, a boreal peatland in northern Sweden. Our results show that daytime rain events systematically decreased the sink strength of peatlands for atmospheric CO2. The decrease was best explained by rain associated reduction in light, rather than by rain characteristics or drought length. An average daytime growing season rain event reduced net ecosystem CO2 uptake by 0.23-0.54gCm(-2). On an annual basis, this reduction of net CO2 uptake corresponds to 24% of the annual net CO2 uptake (NEE) of the study site, equivalent to a 4.4% reduction of gross primary production (GPP) during the growing season. We conclude that reduced light availability associated with rain events is more important in explaining the NEE response to rain events than rain characteristics and changes in water availability. This suggests that peatland CO2 uptake is highly sensitive to changes in cloud cover formation and to altered rainfall regimes, a process hitherto largely ignored.

AB The capacity of peatlands in the northern hemisphere to provide carbon storage, maintain water quality and support northern biodiversity is threatened by a combination of climate change and inappropriate land management. Historical drainage and increasing temperatures threaten the maintenance of the high water tables required for effective peatland functioning, and there is an urgent need to develop appropriate adaptation strategies. Here we use a large-scale replicated experimental design to test the effects of artificial drainage and drain blocking upon soil moisture and cranefly (Diptera: Tipulidae) abundance. Craneflies constitute a key component of peatland biological communities; they are important herbivores and a major prey item for breeding birds. However, they are also susceptible to drought, so are at risk from future climate change. We found that cranefly abundance increased with soil moisture, in a wedge-shaped relationship; high soil moisture is a necessary condition for high cranefly abundance. Blocking drains increased both soil moisture (by 0.06 m(3) m(-3) in 2009 and 0.23 m(3) m(-3) in 2010) and cranefly abundance (1.3-fold in 2009, 4.5-fold in 2010), but the strength and significance of the effects varied between years. The benefits of restoring ecosystem moisture levels are likely to be greatest during dry years and at dry sites. This study provides some of the first evidence that adaptation management can potentially reduce some of the negative effects of climate change on vulnerable peatland systems. Management to maintain or increase soil moisture in peatlands can therefore be expected to increase populations of craneflies and their avian predators (which are of conservation and economic interest), but also increase the resilience of the ecosystem to future warming and increasingly frequent droughts, and improve carbon storage and water quality.

AB Peatlands in discontinuous permafrost regions occur as a mosaic of wetland types, each with variable sensitivity to climate change. Permafrost thaw further increases the spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem structure and function in peatlands. Carbon (C) fluxes are well characterized in end-member thaw stages such as fully intact or fully thawed permafrost but remain unconstrained for transitional stages that cover a significant area of thawing peatlands. Furthermore, changes in the environmental correlates of C fluxes, due to thaw, are not well described - a requirement for modeling future changes to C storage of permafrost peatlands. We investigated C fluxes and their correlates in end-member and a number of transitional thaw stages in a sub-arctic peatland. Across peatland-lumped CH4 and CO2 flux data had significant correlations with expected correlates such as water table depth, thaw depth, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation and vascular green area. Within individual thaw states, bivariate correlations as well as multiple regressions between C flux and environmental factors changed variably with increasing thaw. The variability in directions and magnitudes of correlates reflects the range of structural conditions that could be present along a thaw gradient. These structural changes correspond to changes in C flux controls, such as temperature and moisture, and their interactions. Temperature sensitivity of CH4 increased with increasing thaw in bivariate analyses, but lack of this trend in multiple regression analyses suggested cofounding effects of substrate or water limitation on the apparent temperature sensitivity. Our results emphasize the importance of incorporating transitional stages of thaw in landscape level C budgets and highlight that end-member or adjacent thaw stages do not adequately describe the variability in structure-function relationships present along a thaw gradient.

TI Consequences of Increased Variation in Peatland Hydrology for Carbon
   Storage: Legacy Effects of Drought and Flood in a Boreal Fen Ecosystem
SO FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article

AB Globally important carbon (C) stores in boreal peatlands are vulnerable to altered hydrology through changes in precipitation and runoff patterns, groundwater inputs, and a changing cryosphere. These changes can affect the extent of boreal wetlands and their ability to sequester and transform C and other nutrients. Variation in precipitation patterns has also been increasing, with greater occurrences of both flooding and drought periods. Recent work has pointed to the increasing role of algal production in regulating C cycling during flooded periods in fen peatlands, but exactly how this affects the C sink-strength of these ecosystems is poorly understood. We evaluated temporal trends in algal biomass, ecosystem C uptake and respiration (using static and floating chamber techniques), and spectroscopic indicators of DOM quality (absorbance and fluorescence) in a boreal rich-fen peatland in which water table position had been experimentally manipulated for 13 years. Superimposed on the water table treatments were natural variations in hydrology, including periods of flooding, which allowed us to examine the legacy effects of flooding on C cycling dynamics. We had a particular focus on understanding the role of algae in regulating C cycling, as the relative contribution of algal production was observed to significantly increase with flooding. Ecosystem measures of gross primary production (GPP) increased with algal biomass, with higher algal biomass and GPP measured in the lowered water table treatment two years after persistent flooding. Prior to flooding the lowered treatment was the weakest C sink (as CO2), but this treatment became the strongest sink after flooding. The lower degree of humification (lower humification index, HIX) and yet lower bioavailability (higher spectral slope ratio, Sr) of DOM observed in the raised treatment prior to flooding persisted after two years of flooding. An index of free or bound proteins (tyrosine index, TI) increased with algal biomass across all plots during flooding, and was lowest in the raised treatment. As such, antecedent drainage conditions determined the sink-strength of this rich fen-which was also reflected in DOM characteristics. These findings indicate that monitoring flooding history and its effects on algal production could become important to estimates of C balance in northern wetlands.

AB Northern peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores, and they show large spatial and temporal variation in the atmospheric exchange of CO2 and CH4. Thus, annual carbon balance must be studied in detail in order to predict the climatic responses of these ecosystems. Closed-chamber methods were used to study CO2 and CH4 in hollow, Sphagnum angustifolium lawn, S. fuscum lawn, and hummock microsites within an ombrotrophic S, fuscum bog. Micrometeorological tower measurements were used as a reference for the CH4 efflux from the bog. Low precipitation during May-August in 1994 (84 mm below the long-term average for the same period) and a warm July-August period caused the water table to drop by more than 15 cm below the peat surface in the hollows and to 48 cm below the surface in high hummocks. Increased annual total respiration exceeded gross production and resulted in a net C loss of 4-157 g/m(2) in the different microsites. Drought probably caused irreversible desiccation in some lawns of S. angustifolium and S. balticum and in S. fuscum in the hummocks, while S. balticum growing in hollows retained its moisture and even increased its photosynthetic capacity during the July-August period. Seasonal (12 May-4 October) CH4 emissions ranged from 2 g CH4-C/m(2) in drier S. fuscum hummocks and lawns to 7 and 14 g/m(2) in wetter S. angustifolium-S. balticum lawns and hollows, respectively. Aerodynamic gradient measurements at the tower showed slightly higher CH4 flux rates than the average estimates for the whole bog obtained by closed-chamber methods. Winter C efflux comprised 30 g CO2-C/m(2) and 1 g CH4-C/m(2) out of a total loss of 90 g C/m(2) on average in the bog, and there was an estimated annual loss of 7 g C/m2 by leaching. This study shows how delicately the boreal bog's C balance in different microsites depends on climatic variations, especially the distribution of precipitation. It also confirms that severe C losses can occur in boreal bogs during extended summer droughts, even in years with annual temperatures close to the long-term average and with precipitation clearly greater than the long-term average.

AB Wetlands are important and restricted habitats for dependent biota and play vital roles in landscape function, hydrology and carbon sequestration. They are also likely to be one of the most sensitive components of the terrestrial biosphere to global climate change. An understanding of relationships between wetland persistence and climate is imperative for predicting, mitigating and adapting to the impacts of future climate change on wetland extent and function. We investigated whether mire wetlands had contracted, expanded or remained stable during 1960-2000. We chose a study area encompassing a regional climatic gradient in southeastern Australia, specifically to avoid confounding effects of water extraction on wetland hydrology and extent. We first characterized trends in climate by examining data from local weather stations, which showed a slight increase in precipitation and marked decline in pan evaporation over the relevant period. Remote sensing of vegetation boundaries showed a marked lateral expansion of mires during 1961-1998, and a corresponding contraction of woodland. The spatial patterns in vegetation change were consistent with the regional climatic gradient and showed a weaker co-relationship to fire history. Resource exploitation, wildland fires and autogenic mire development failed to explain the observed expansion of mire vegetation in the absence of climate change. We therefore conclude that the extent of mire wetlands is likely to be sensitive to variation in climatic moisture over decadal time scales. Late 20th-century trends in climatic moisture may be related primarily to reduced irradiance and/or reduced wind speeds. In the 21st century, however, net climatic moisture in this region is projected to decline. As mires are apparently sensitive to hydrological change, we anticipate lateral contraction of mire boundaries in coming decades as projected climatic drying eventuates. This raises concerns about the future hydrological functions, carbon storage capacity and unique biodiversity of these important ecosystems.

AB Climate change is likely to significantly affect the hydrology, ecology, and ecosystem function of peatlands, with potentially important but unclear impacts on mercury mobility within and transport from peatlands. Using a full-factorial mesocosm approach, we investigated the potential impacts on mercury mobility of water table regime changes (high and low) and vegetation community shifts (sedge-dominated, Ericaceae-dominated, or unmanipulated control) in peat monoliths at the PEATcosm mesocosm facility in Houghton, Michigan. Lower and more variable water table regimes and the loss of Ericaceae shrubs act significantly and independently to increase both total Hg and methylmercury concentrations in peat pore water and in spring snowmelt runoff. These differences are related to enhanced peat decomposition and internal regeneration of electron acceptors which are more strongly related to water table regime than to plant community changes. Loss of Ericaceae shrubs and an increase in sedge cover may also affect Hg concentrations and mobility via oxygen shuttling and/or the provision of labile root exudates. Altered hydrological regimes and shifting vegetation communities, as a result of global climate change, are likely to enhance Hg transport from peatlands to downstream aquatic ecosystems.

AB Despite the fact that volcanic ash (tephra) layers are found preserved in peat deposits around the world, comparatively little research has investigated the impacts of distal volcanic emissions on peatlands. This study investigates the impacts of several late-Holocene volcanic eruptions on five peatlands in southern Alaska using a palaeoecological approach. Testate amoebae analysis, peat humification analysis and a basic analysis of plant macrofossil components were applied across 11 tephra layers. Changes in macrofossil and testate amoebae assemblages occur across several of the tephra layers. The humification results were considered unreliable because of a methodological problem, a finding which may have implications for other studies using this technique. Redundancy analyses on testate amoebae data show statistically significant changes associated with two tephras. The most likely causes of the impacts are volcanic gases, acidic precipitation or tephra-derived leachates. The finding that some tephras are associated with impacts whereas others are not may relate to the season of the eruption or meteorological conditions at the time of ash fall. These results suggest the sensitivity of peatlands and peatland microbial communities to distal volcanic products and imply that changes in key palaeoclimatic proxies may be caused by a mechanism independent of climate change. Implications of the results for peat-based palaeoclimatic studies are discussed, as are possible directions for future research. (C)2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland areas provide a range of ecosystem services, including biodiversity, carbon storage, clean water, and flood mitigation, but many areas of peatland in the UK have been degraded through human land use including drainage. Here, we explore whether remote sensing can be used to monitor peatland resilience to drought. We take resilience to mean the rate at which a system recovers from perturbation; here measured literally as a recovery timescale of a soil surface moisture proxy from drought lowering. Our objectives were (1) to assess the reliability of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter as a proxy for water table depth (WTD); (2) to develop a method using SAR to estimate below-ground (hydrological) resilience of peatlands; and (3) to apply the developed method to different sites and consider the links between resilience and land management. Our inferences of WTD from Sentinel-1 SAR data gave results with an average Pearson's correlation of 0.77 when compared to measured WTD values. The 2018 summer drought was used to assess resilience across three different UK peatland areas (Dartmoor, the Peak District, and the Flow Country) by considering the timescale of the soil moisture proxy recovery. Results show clear areas of lower resilience within all three study sites, which often correspond to areas of high drainage and may be particularly vulnerable to increasing drought severity/events under climate change. This method is applicable to monitoring peatland resilience elsewhere over larger scales, and could be used to target restoration work towards the most vulnerable areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mountain fens found in western North America have sequestered atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) for millennia, provide important habitat for wildlife, and serve as refugia for regionally-rare plant species typically found in boreal regions. It is unclear how Rocky Mountain fens are responding to a changing climate. It is possible that fens found at lower elevations may be particularly susceptible to changes because hydrological cycles that control water tables are likely to vary the most. In this study, we fit models of growing season ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange to field-measured data among eight fen plant communities at four mountain fens along a climatic gradient in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming. Differences in growing season net ecosystem production (NEP) among study sites were not well correlated with monsoon precipitation, despite a twofold increase in summer rainfall between two study regions. Our results show that NEP was higher for fens located at high elevations compared to those found at lower elevations, with growing season estimates ranging from -342 to 256 g CO2-C m(-2). This was reflected in the negative correlation of growing season NEP with air temperature, and positive correlation with water table position, as the high elevation sites had the lowest air temperatures and highest water tables due to greater snowpack and later onset of melt. Our results suggest that sustainability of mountain fens occurring at the lower end of the known elevation range may be particularly susceptible to a changing climate, as these peatlands already experience lower snowpack, earlier snow melt, and warmer growing season air temperatures, which are all likely to be exacerbated under a future climate.

AB Understanding the processes controlling peatland carbon (C) sequestration is critical to anticipate potential changes in the global C cycle in response to climate change. Although identification of these factors may be relatively straightforward on seasonal timescales, at centennial to millennial timescales complexities arise because of interactions between climate, vegetation, hydrology and long-term ecological processes. To better understand the factors controlling long-term C accumulation, Holocene rates of C sequestration were quantified from three pristine ombrotrophic peatlands in boreal Quebec, northeastern Canada (52 degrees N, 75-76 degrees W). Bulk density and loss-on-ignition analyses, combined with radiocarbon dating and age-depth modelling, were used to estimate long-term apparent rates of carbon accumulation. Past changes in vegetation and water-table depth were obtained from plant macrofossil and testate amoeba analysis. Earliest regional peat accumulation started similar to 7520 cal. BP, with long-term rates of C sequestration varying between 14.9 and 22.6 g/m(2) per yr. High C sequestration rates occurred during the mid Holocene when relatively stable Sphagnum section Acutifolia communities were present, while low rates were found during the cooler late Holocene when Cyperaceae and ligneous vegetation were more dominant. However, C sequestration was highly variable among cores, implying that local topography, geomorphology and hydrology, or disturbance factors such as fire, mediate the influence of climate on C accumulation. Reconstructed water-table depths reveal several dry shifts since 3000 cal. BP, suggesting that episodic cold and dry conditions during the late Holocene may have contributed to lower C sequestration rates. Given the intensity of the water-table shifts at these times, we hypothesize that recurrent episodes of frozen subsurface peat might have intensified surface drying. As projected by climate scenarios, anticipated warmer and wetter conditions may lead to greater stability of hummock Sphagna cover and increased C sequestration potential in boreal peatlands.

AB The Duff Moisture Code (DMC) and Drought Code (DC) components of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System are used by fire managers to assess the vulnerability of organic soils to ignition and depth of burn despite being developed for upland soils. Given the need to assess wildfire risk in peatlands, we compared the DMC and DC in eight peatlands located in five regions in boreal Canada with water table position (WT) and surface volumetric moisture content (VMC). The slope of the change in WT and DC relationship ranged greatly (-0.01 to -0.11 cm) between sites and years likely due to differences in site-specific peat properties, catchment water supply, and presence of seasonal ice. A DC of 400, which has been associated with wildfire vulnerability in uplands, corresponded to a seasonal drop in WT in the range of 4-36 cm. The slopes of the relationships between DMC and DC with 5 and 15 cm VMC also varied greatly between sites. Our findings suggest that these FWI components are suitable for predicting the general moisture status and fire danger in boreal peatlands. However, there is a need for a modified DC for specific peat types to indicate when the WT has reached a critical depth upon which fire danger increases. We also present a suggested framework for the development of a new peat moisture code within the FWI.

AB Testate amoebae are abundant in the surface layers of northern peatlands. Analysis of their fossilized shell (test) assemblages allows for reconstructions of local water-table depths (WTD). We have reconstructed WTD dynamics for five peat cores from peatlands ranging in distance from the Athabasca bituminous sands (ABS) region in western Canada. Amoeba assemblages were combined with plant macrofossil records, acid-insoluble ash (AIA) fluxes and instrumental climate data to identify drivers for environmental change. Two functional traits of testate amoebae, mixotrophy and the tendency to integrate xenogenic mineral matter in test construction, were quantified to infer possible effects of AIA flux on testate amoeba presence. Age-depth models showed the cores each covered at least the last 315years, with some spanning the last millennium. Testate amoeba assemblages were likely affected by permafrost development in two of the peatlands, yet the most important shift in assemblages was detected after 1960 CE. This shift represents a significant apparent lowering of water tables in four out of five cores, with a mean drop of 15cm. Over the last 50years, assemblages shifted towards more xerophilous taxa, a trend which was best explained by increasing Sphagnum s. Acutifolia and, to a lesser extent, mean summer temperature. This trend was most evident in the two cores from the sites located farthest away from the ABS region. AIA flux variations did not show a clear effect on mineral-agglutinating taxa, nor on S.s.Acutifolia presence. We therefore suggest the drying trend was forced by the establishment of S.s.Acutifolia, driven by enhanced productivity following regional warming. Such recent apparent drying of peatlands, which may only be reconstructed by appropriate indicators combined with high chronological control, may affect vulnerability to future burning and promote emissions of CO2.

AB Peatlands are recognised as an important but vulnerable ecological resource. Understanding the effects of existing damage, in this case erosion, enables more informed land management decisions to be made. Over the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014 photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were measured using closed chamber techniques within vegetated haggs and erosional peat pans in Dartmoor National Park, southwest England. Below-ground total and heterotrophic respiration were measured and autotrophic respiration estimated from the vegetated haggs. The mean water table was significantly higher in the peat pans than in the vegetated haggs; because of this, and the switching from submerged to dry peat, there were differences in vegetation composition, photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. In the peat pans photosynthetic CO2 uptake and ecosystem respiration were greater than in the vegetated haggs and strongly dependent on the depth to water table (r(2)>0.78, p<0.001). Whilst in the vegetated haggs, photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration had the strongest relationships with normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r(2)=0.82, p<0.001) and soil temperature at 15cm depth (r(2)=0.77, p=0.001). Autotrophic and total below-ground respiration in the vegetated haggs varied with soil temperature; heterotrophic respiration increased as water tables fell. An empirically derived net ecosystem model estimated that over the two growing seasons both the vegetated haggs (29 and 20gCm(-2); 95% confidence intervals of -570 to 762 and -873 to 1105 gCm(-2)) and the peat pans (7 and 8gCm(-2); 95% confidence intervals of -147 to 465 and -136 to 436gCm(-2)) were most likely net CO2 sources. This study suggests that not only the visibly degraded bare peat pans but also the surrounding vegetated haggs are losing carbon to the atmosphere, particularly during warmer and drier conditions, highlighting a need for ecohydrological restoration.

AB To constrain the effect of climate and peatland type on carbon accumulation, we reconstructed these parameters from a Holocene-length core of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland near Cordova, AK, USA. We determined peat type using a combination of peat texture and density, macrofossils, distributions of leaf-wax biomarkers, and soil pH reconstructions based on distributions of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (brGDGTs). We produced an independent record of hydroclimate and temperature change using hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf-wax biomarkers and distributions of brGDGTs. Carbon accumulation rates were constrained with 14 AMS C-14 dates from identified macrofossils and ash-free bulk density. In the early Holocene, the site was a shallow pond with evidence for emergent macrophytes, Sphagnum, and algae growing in a warm, moist climate. At 9.2 kyr (1 kyr = 1000 cal. yr BP), the site became a Sphagnum-dominated bog. Under mid-Holocene warm, evaporative climate conditions, the site became sedge-dominated. As climate cooled and effective precipitation increased, Sphagnum was able to gain dominance abruptly at similar to 3.5 kyr. Large changes in the vegetation assemblage and hydrology and climate are contemporaneous with significant changes in the rate of carbon accumulation. Carbon accumulated most rapidly when Sphagnum dominated and effective moisture was high and most slowly when sedges were dominant and conditions were warmer and drier. Estimates of future climate change indicate warmer, more evaporative conditions that, in the past, favored a sedge-dominated environment, suggesting that this peatland and those similar can contribute to a positive feedback to warming by transitioning to less efficient carbon sinks.

AB Controls on the fate of similar to 277 Pg of soil organic carbon (C) stored in permafrost peatland soils remain poorly understood despite the potential for a significant positive feedback to climate change. Our objective was to quantify the temperature, moisture, organic matter, and microbial controls on soil organic carbon (SOC) losses following permafrost thaw in peat soils across Alaska. We compared the carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from peat samples collected at active layer and permafrost depths when incubated aerobically and anaerobically at -5, -0.5, +4, and +20 degrees C. Temperature had a strong, positive effect on C emissions; global warming potential (GWP) was >3x larger at 20 degrees C than at 4 degrees C. Anaerobic conditions significantly reduced CO2 emissions and GWP by 47% at 20 degrees C but did not have a significant effect at -0.5 degrees C. Net anaerobic CH4 production over 30 days was 7.1 +/- 2.8 mu g CH4-C gC(-1) at 20 degrees C. Cumulative CO2 emissions were related to organic matter chemistry and best predicted by the relative abundance of polysaccharides and proteins (R-2 = 0.81) in SOC. Carbon emissions (CO2-C + CH4-C) from the active layer depth peat ranged from 77% larger to not significantly different than permafrost depths and varied depending on the peat type and peat decomposition stage rather than thermal state. Potential SOC losses with warming depend not only on the magnitude of temperature increase and hydrology but also organic matter quality, permafrost history, and vegetation dynamics, which will ultimately determine net radiative forcing due to permafrost thaw.

AB Biogeochemical processes in peatland environments, such as carbon sequestration and decomposition, are affected by variation in water supply. Across the boreal forest biome, climate change threatens to either alter rates of annual precipitation or skew the timing and ratio of rainfall and snowfall events. To simulate moisture variability during the ice-free season, cylindrical mesocosms (diameter 1.5 m) were installed in a southern boreal patterned fen in central Saskatchewan, Canada, to enable manipulations of antecedent snow conditions. The objectives of the study were to assess the utility of in situ mesocosms for peatland ecohydrology research and to test for effects of snow manipulations on fen plant communities. After spring thaw, initial water depths were greatest and dates of surface water disappearance were latest in the snow addition mesocosms, followed by the control and snow removal mesocosms. In contrast, maximum frost levels and frost disappearance dates in the snow addition mesocosms were intermediate to those of the control and snow removal mesocosms. Densification of snow during snow manipulation events is suggested to account for this confounding outcome. Of the nine plant taxa identified in the harvests of aboveground biomass from all mesocosms, buckbean (Menyanthes trifoliata) biomass was most strongly related to variation in surface water conditions. Climate conditions that favour persistence of either herbaceous- or graminoid-dominated communities will likely affect the carbon storage function of southern boreal fens.

TI Drought years in peatland rewetting: rapid vegetation succession can

AB The rewetting of peatlands is regarded as an important nature-based climate solution and intended to reconcile climate protection with the restoration of self-regulating ecosystems that are resistant to climate impacts. Although the severity and frequency of droughts are predicted to increase as a consequence of climate change, it is not well understood whether such extreme events can jeopardize rewetting measures. The goal of this study was to better understand drought effects on vegetation development and the exchange of the two important greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4, especially in rewetted fens. Based on long-term reference records, we investigated anomalies in vegetation dynamics, CH4 emissions, and net CO2 exchange, including the component fluxes of ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), in a rewetted fen during the extreme European summer drought in 2018. Drought-induced vegetation dynamics were derived from remotely sensed data.
   Since flooding in 2010, the fen was characterized by a patchy mosaic of open-water surfaces and vegetated areas. After years of stagnant vegetation development, drought acted as a trigger event for pioneer species such as Tephroseris palustris and Ranunculus sceleratus to rapidly close persistent vegetation gaps. The massive spread of vegetation assimilated substantial amounts of CO2. In 2018, the annual GEP budget increased by 20 % in comparison to average years (2010-2017). R-eco increased even by 40 %, but enhanced photosynthetic CO2 sequestration could compensate for half of the drought-induced increase in respiratory CO2 release. Altogether, the restored fen remained a net CO2 sink in the year of drought, though net CO2 sequestration was lower than in other years. CH4 emissions were 20 % below average on an annual basis, though stronger reduction effects occurred from August onwards, when daily fluxes were 60 % lower than in reference years.
   Our study reveals an important regulatory mechanism of restored fens to maintain their net CO2 sink function even in extremely dry years. It appears that, in times of more frequent climate extremes, fen restoration can create ecosystems resilient to drought. However, in order to comprehensively assess the mitigation prospects of peatland rewetting as a nature-based climate solution, further research needs to focus on the long-term effects of such extreme events beyond the actual drought period.

AB Northern peatlands have accumulated large carbon (C) stocks since the last deglaciation and during past millennia they have acted as important atmospheric C sinks. However, it is still poorly understood how northern peatlands in general and Arctic permafrost peatlands in particular will respond to future climate change. In this study, we present C accumulation reconstructions derived from 14 peat cores from four permafrost peatlands in northeast European Russia and Finnish Lapland. The main focus is on warm climate phases. We used regression analyses to test the importance of different environmental variables such as summer temperature, hydrology, and vegetation as drivers for nonautogenic C accumulation. We used modeling approaches to simulate potential decomposition patterns. The data show that our study sites have been persistent mid- to late-Holocene C sinks with an average accumulation rate of 10.80-32.40g C m(-2) year(-1). The warmer climate phase during the Holocene Thermal Maximum stimulated faster apparent C accumulation rates while the Medieval Climate Anomaly did not. Moreover, during the Little Ice Age, apparent C accumulation rates were controlled more by other factors than by cold climate per se. Although we could not identify any significant environmental factor that drove C accumulation, our data show that recent warming has increased C accumulation in some permafrost peatland sites. However, the synchronous slight decrease of C accumulation in other sites may be an alternative response of these peatlands to warming in the future. This would lead to a decrease in the C sequestration ability of permafrost peatlands overall.

AB Despite being a significant input into soil carbon pools of many high-latitude ecosystems, little is known about the effects of climate change on the turnover of mycorrhizal fungal necromass. Here, we present results from the first experiment examining the effects of climate change on the long-term decomposition of mycorrhizal necromass, utilising the Spruce and Peatland Response Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. Warming significantly increased necromass decomposition rates but was strongest in normally submerged microsites where warming caused water table drawdown. Necromass chemistry exerted the strongest control on the decomposition, with initial nitrogen content strongly predicting early decay rates (3 months) and initial melanin content determining mass remaining after 2 years. Collectively, our results suggest that as global temperatures rise, variation in species biochemical traits as well as microsites where mycorrhizal necromass is deposited will determine how these important inputs contribute to the belowground storage of carbon in boreal peatlands.

AB Peatlands in Zoige Plateau contains more than half of peatland carbon stock in China. This part of carbon is losing with climate change through dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, both of which are vulnerable to the environmental changes, especially on the Zoige Plateau with a pace of twice the observed rate of global climate warming. This research aimed to understand how climate change including soil warming, rainfall reduction and water table change affect CO2 emissions and whether the trends of changes in CO2 emission are consistent with those of pore water DOC concentration. A mesocosm experiment was designed to investigate the CO2 emission and pore water DOC during the growing seasons of 2009-2010 under scenarios of passive soil warming, 20% rainfall reduction and changes to the water table levels. The results showed a positive relationship between CO2 emission and DOC concentration. For single factor effect, we found no significant relationship between water table and CO2 emission or DOC concentration. However, temperature at 5 cm depth was found to have positive linear relationship with CO2 emission and DOC concentration. The combined effect of soil warming and rainfall reduction increased CO2 emission by. 96.8%. It suggested that the drying and warming could stimulate potential emission of CO2. Extending this result to the entire peatland area in Zoige Plateau translates into 0.45 Tg CO2 emission per year over a growing season. These results suggested that the dryer and warmer Zoige Plateau will increase CO2 emission. We also found the contribution rate of DOC concentration to CO2 emission was increased by 12.1% in the surface layer and decreased by 13.8% in the subsurface layer with combined treatment of soil warming and rainfall reduction, which indicated that the warmer and dryer environmental conditions stimulate surface peat decomposition process.

AB The accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the profiles of permafrost-affected peat mounds is related to certain groups of plant residues produced in the Atlantic climatic optimum of the Holocene. Both "heavy" (benzo[ghi]perylene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, and benzo[b]fluoranthene) and "light" (pyrene and naphthalene) PAHs predominate in them. The polyarenes preserved in the permafrost horizons are not subjected to transformation in contrast to the polyarenes in the active layer. Dynamic freeze-thaw processes at the boundary between seasonally thawed and permanently frozen layers result in considerable transformation of plant remains, humic substances, and nonspecific organic compounds with the accumulation of 5-6-nuclear PAH structures. The composition of PAHs in peatlands and a significant increase in the weight fraction of PAHs at the boundary between seasonally thawed and permafrost layers may serve as indicators of permafrost response to climate changes in high latitudes.

TI PESERA-PEAT: a fluvial erosion model for blanket peatlands

AB In peatlands, fluvial erosion can lead to a dramatic decline in hydrological function, major changes in the net carbon balance and loss of biodiversity. Climate and land management change are thought to be important influences on rates of peat erosion. However, sediment production in peatlands is different to that of other soils and no models of erosion specifically for peatlands currently exist. Hence, forecasting the influence of future climate or spatially-distributed management interventions on peat erosion is difficult. The PESERA-GRID model was substantially modified in this study to include dominant blanket peat erosion processes. In the resulting fluvial erosion model, PESERA-PEAT, freeze-thaw and desiccation processes were accounted for by a novel sediment supply index as key features of erosion. Land management practices were parameterized for their influence on vegetation cover, biomass and soil moisture condition. PESERA-PEAT was numerically evaluated using available field data from four blanket peat-covered catchments with different erosion conditions and management intensity. PESERA-PEAT was found to be robust in modelling fluvial erosion in blanket peat. A sensitivity analysis of PESERA-PEAT showed that modelled sediment yield was more sensitive to vegetation cover than other tested factors such as precipitation, temperature, drainage density and ditch/gully depth. Two versions of PESERA-PEAT, equilibrium and time-series, produced similar results under the same environmental conditions, facilitating the use of the model at different scales. The equilibrium model is suitable for assessing the high-resolution spatial variability of average monthly peat erosion over the study period across large areas (national or global assessments), while the time-series model is appropriate for investigating continuous monthly peat erosion throughout study periods across smaller areas or large regions using a coarser-spatial resolution. PESERA-PEAT will therefore support future investigations into the impact of climate change and management options on blanket peat erosion at various spatial and temporal scales.

AB The Tea Bag Index (TBI) method was used to estimate the litter decomposition rate in peatland exposed for climate manipulation (increased temperature and reduced precipitation) at two contrasting sites differing in water table depth (WTD) dynamics. To manipulate climate on peatland, the prototyped Open Top Chambers (OTC) and automated rain-out shelters were used. OTCs increased daytime air temperatures by similar to 1.7 degrees C at the driest plots exposed for an increase of air temperature and reduced precipitation, while the increase of the average daily air temperature was lower than 0.9 degrees C. However, OTCs cooled down the peat temperature even by 0.8 degrees C and this effect was most pronounced for daytime rather than night-time conditions. The precipitation amount was reduced by 26%. The tea bags were buried at 8 cm depth for 83 and 172 days starting from the 19th of April 2019. Our observation proved that although decomposition rates were dependent on temperature, WTD and its fluctuations are the main factors controlling the rates of litter decomposition in waterlogged ecosystems like ours. At waterlogged Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, the interrelation between different environmental factors may mitigate the impact of warming and reduced precipitation on litter decomposition.

AB Peatlands are habitats for a range of fragile flora and fauna species. Their eco-physicochemical characteristics make them as outstanding global carbon and water storage systems. These ecosystems occupy 3% of the worldwide emerged land surface but represent 30% of the global organic soil carbon and 10% of the global fresh water volumes. In such systems, carbon speciation depends to a large extent on specific redox conditions which are mainly governed by the depth of the water table. Hence, understanding their hydrological variability, that conditions both their ecological and biogeochemical functions, is crucial for their management, especially when anticipating their future evolution under climate change. This study illustrates how long-term monitoring of basic hydro-meteorological parameters combined with statistical modeling can be used as a tool to evaluate i) the horizontal (type of peat), ii) vertical (acrotelm/catotelm continuum) and iii) future hydrological variability. Using cross-correlations between meteorological data (precipitation, potential evapotranspiration) and water table depth (WTD), we primarily highlight the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological reactivity across the Sphagnumdominated Frasne peatland (French Jura Mountain). Then, a multiple linear regression model allows performing hydrological projections until 2100, according to regionalized IPCC RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Although WTD re-mains stable during the first half of 21th century, seasonal trends beyond 2050 show lower WTD in winter and markedly greater WTD in summer. In particular, after 2050, more frequent droughts in summer and autumn should occur, increasing WTD. These projections are completed with risk evaluations for peatland droughts until 2100 that appear to be increasing especially for transition seasons, i.e. May-June and September-October. Comparing these trends with previous evaluations of phenol concentrations in water throughout the vegetative period, considered as a proxy of plant functioning intensity, highlights that these hydrological modifications during transitional seasons could be a great ecological perturbation, especially by affecting Sphagnum metabolism.

AB During 2002-2013, we surveyed butterflies in three types of bogs (pristine but naturally fragmented). Of the 75 bogs surveyed, we established 29 bogs and 5 bog roadsides as long-term sites visited annually for 9-15 years. We studied patterns of ten butterfly species' flight periods, annual variation, trend in abundance over time, and abundance with respect to climatic variables. First observed date per year varied more for spring than summer species. Jutta arctic Oeneis jutta varied between dramatically high numbers in odd years and low numbers in even years in northeast Wisconsin. Elsewhere, Jutta arctic varied less between odd and even years, but muskegs had higher numbers in even than odd years, significantly so in north central Wisconsin. The most abundant bog affiliate (tyrphophile), brown elfin Callophrys augustinus, exhibited cyclic abundance over a 4-5 year period. The other species varied greatly in abundance among years but not in as distinctive annual patterns. The most northern specialist (tyrphobiont), purplish fritillary Boloria montinus, declined strongly. Its abundance significantly related to higher precipitation but not to temperature. Population trends for the seven other tyrphobionts did not relate to how southerly their ranges are. Trends in roadsides were less favorable than in bogs. Butterfly abundance had more significant correlations to climate variables related to moisture than to temperature. Based on abundance relationships to climate, a majority of the study species allied as dry steppe species (increasing in warmer, drier periods) and a minority as wetland species (increasing in cooler, wetter periods). The overriding factors determining the future of this butterfly fauna appear to be habitat degradation and potential climate change beyond the range of variation typically experienced in this region between glaciations.

TI Carbon emissions from a temperate peat fire and its relevance to

AB [1] The contribution of wildfire in peatlands outside of boreal and tropical regions to interannual variability of global carbon emissions has been relatively little studied. There are 0.19 to 0.88 million km(2) of localized peat deposits in the temperate zone ( 30 - 50 degrees latitude) where drainage and climate change may affect the status of this potentially large carbon pool. For example, in the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA, where wildfire is common, over 325 teragrams of carbon (Tg C) are stored in peat deposits up to 5 m deep. We estimated carbon emissions for a temperate peatland fire in North Carolina using remote sensing to reconstruct burn severity and topographic lidar to constrain peat burn depths. Total carbon emissions for the fire ranged from 1 to 3.8 Tg, with spatially heterogeneous patterns of carbon fluxes (0.2 to 11 kg C m(-2)) responding to variation in vegetation type, peat burn depth, soil substrate ( mineral or organic), and fire severity. To maintain a carbon sink in this region at the current rates of carbon sequestration (0.109 to 0.127 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) we estimated a fire return interval of greater than 20 - 80 years. Continued drainage and future drought could decrease the fire return interval to less than 20 years or increase peat burn depths thereby converting these peatlands into a net carbon source. On a global scale, this study suggests that temperate peatland fires may emit up to 0.32 petagrams of carbon during drought years, a significant contribution to interannual greenhouse gas variability.

AB There are 10,091 km(2) of peatlands in Estonia and human activities may have changed the role of northern peatlands from global sinks to global sources of carbon. The aim of this work was to explain the changes in organic carbon exports from eleven Estonian rivers in the period 1992-2007 in terms of land use change, climate change quantified by trends in stream-water discharge and hydrological droughts and reductions in atmospheric sulfate quantified by change in water chemistry. Direct TOC (total organic carbon) measurements had been initiated in 1998. We used CODKMnO4 (permanganate oxygen consumed) as its surrogate for the whole time span (Spearman's determination coefficient in six small northern Estonian rivers 0.95 > rho(2) > 0.72; p < 0.01). The Mann-Kendall test revealed significant trends in the TOC proxy in five small rivers in northern Estonia (M-K stat > 2.35; p < 0.05). The trends in the eleven investigated streams correlated closely with the increased 28 ratios of drought days (Spearman's rho(2) = 0.68; p < 0.01). The correlations with land use compositions, decreases in water discharges and SO4 (2-) concentrations were insignificant (p > 0.05). We conclude that the main factor in the increase of organic carbon export is the deepening of droughts driven by climate change, magnified by man-made drainage.

AB To quantify the effects of water table drawdown and soil warming on CH4 fluxes, we used a static chamber technique during the growing seasons (May-October) of 2011-2013 at hollow and hummock microforms at three sites of a continental bog near the town of Wandering River, Alberta, Canada: (1) Control, (2) Experimental drained, and (3) old Drained. To simulate climatic warming, we used open top chambers to passively warm half of the hollows and half of the hummocks at each of the water level treatment sites. Water table drawdown significantly reduced CH4 flux by 50% in 3 years and 76% in 13 years of drainage. The hollows showed greater reduction of efflux as compared to hummocks. A persistent functional relationship of CH4 flux with water level was found across all sites in all years. The relationship revealed that the contribution of change in vegetation type at hollows and hummocks to CH4 production and emission was relatively less important than that of the water level. Hummocks and hollows responded to warming differently. At the control, experimental and drained sites, warming increased flux at hollows by 16, 21 and 26%, and reduced flux at hummocks by 4, 37, and 56%, respectively. The combined effect of lowered water table and warming on CH4 emission was overall negative, although the interaction between the two contributing factors was not significant. Therefore, whereas climatic warming and subsequent lowering of water table are expected to reduce CH4 efflux from dry ombrotrophic bogs of Alberta, different microforms at these bogs may respond differently with accelerated emissions at warmed, wetter (hollows) and reduced emissions at warmed, drier (hummocks) microforms. Overall, CH4 efflux from Alberta's dry continental bogs that are not underlain by permafrost might be affected only slightly by the direct effect of predicted climate warming, although initial water table position will be an important control on the overall response.

AB Recent accelerated decay of discontinuous permafrost at the Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden has been attributed to increased temperature and snow depth, and has caused expansion of wet minerotrophic areas leading to significant changes in carbon cycling in the mire. In order to track these changes through time and evaluate potential forcing mechanisms, this paper analyses a peat succession and a lake sediment sequence from within the mire, providing a record for the last 100 years, and compares these with monitored climate and active layer thickness data. The peat core was analysed for testate amoebae to reconstruct changes in peatland surface moisture conditions and water table fluctuations. The lake sediment core was analysed by near infrared spectroscopy to infer changes in the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the lake-water, and changes in delta C-13 and C, N and delta N-15 to track changes in the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool and the influence of diagenetic effects on sediment organic matter, respectively. Results showed that major shifts towards increased peat surface moisture and TOC concentration of the lake-water occurred around 1980, one to two decades earlier than a temperature driven increase in active layer thickness. Comparison with monitored temperature and precipitation from a nearby climate station indicates that this change in peat surface moisture is related to June-September (JJAS) precipitation and that the increase in lake-water TOC concentration reflects an increase in total annual precipitation. A significant depletion in C-13 of sediment organic matter in the early 1980s probably reflects the effect of a single or a few consecutive years with anomalously high summer precipitation, resulting in elevated DIC content of the lake water, predominantly originating from increased export and subsequent respiration of organic carbon from the mire. Based on these results, it was not possible to link proxy data obtained on peat and lake-sediment records directly to permafrost decay. Instead our data indicate that increased precipitation and anomalously high rainfall during summers had a significant impact on the mire and the adjacent lake ecosystem. We therefore propose that effects of increased precipitation should be considered when evaluating potential forcing mechanisms of recent changes in carbon cycling in the subarctic.

AB Global warming is an important issue which is leading to considerable changes in biomes. Environmental biologists are continuously assessing how global warming is going to impact the current population. Peatlands are one of the most important component of the terrestrial ecosystems which makes only 3% of them but contain around 40% of soil organic carbon. The composition of peatland vegetation impacts a range of ecosystem functions, therefore, with a change in composition, the behavior and structure of peatland plant communities are predicted to change. This work is focused on the response of Sphagnum peatland (in Poland), to the manipulated environmental conditions. The experimental design consisted of four treatments (control, warming, reduced precipitation, and a combination of warming & reduced precipitation), three replicates of each. Active warming with infrared heaters ((similar to)1.0-1.4 degrees C peat temperature increase) and an automatic curtain to reduce precipitation ((similar to)30% reduction in the rain) was applied continuously since 2015. The warming and reduced precipitation caused a significant variation in the vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), Water Band Index (WBI), and Chlorophyll Green Index (CIgreen) between manipulated sites. The abundance of major plant species was recorded between manipulated sites. The prompt chlorophyll fluorescence measurement was performed in the peak of the vegetation season of August 2017 which had shown a significant variation in photosynthetic induction curve and different photosynthetic parameters from the same plant species in between the manipulated sites. The data clearly indicate that a short-term climate manipulation resulted in the change of plant abundance and its physiology, which varied for different plant species. Our study indicates that the different plant species respond differently to climate change. The study also proposes the significance of simple vegetation indices for peatland vegetation observation.

AB Climate warming has inevitable impacts on the vegetation and hydrological dynamics of high-latitude permafrost peatlands. These impacts in turn determine the role of these peatlands in the global biogeochemical cycle. Here, we used six active layer peat cores from four permafrost peatlands in Northeast European Russia and Finnish Lapland to investigate permafrost peatland dynamics over the last millennium. Testate amoeba and plant macrofossils were used as proxies for hydrological and vegetation changes. Our results show that during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), Russian sites experienced short-term permafrost thawing and this induced alternating dry-wet habitat changes eventually followed by desiccation. During the Little Ice Age (LIA) both sites generally supported dry hummock habitats, at least partly driven by permafrost aggradation. However, proxy data suggest that occasionally, MCA habitat conditions were drier than during the LIA, implying that evapotranspiration may create important additionaleco-hydrological feedback mechanisms under warm conditions. All sites showed a tendency towards dry conditions as inferred from both proxies starting either from ca. 100 years ago or in the past few decades after slight permafrost thawing, suggesting that recent warming has stimulated surface desiccation rather than deeper permafrost thawing. This study shows links between two important controls over hydrology and vegetation changes in high-latitude peatlands: direct temperature-induced surface layer response and deeper permafrost layer-related dynamics. These data provide important backgrounds for predictions of Arctic permafrost peatlands and related feedback mechanisms. Our results highlight the importance of increased evapotranspiration and thus provide an additional perspective to understanding of peatland-climate feedback mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatlands store 30% of the world's terrestrial soil carbon (C) and those located at northern latitudes are expected to experience rapid climate warming. We monitored growing season carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes across a factorial design of in situ water table (control, drought, and flooded plots) and soil warming (control vs. warming via open top chambers) treatments for 2 years in a rich fen located just outside the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest in interior Alaska. The drought (lowered water table position) treatment was a weak sink or small source of atmospheric CO2 compared to the moderate atmospheric CO2 sink at our control. This change in net ecosystem exchange was due to lower gross primary production and light-saturated photosynthesis rather than increased ecosystem respiration. The flooded (raised water table position) treatment was a greater CO2 sink in 2006 due largely to increased early season gross primary production and higher light-saturated photosynthesis. Although flooding did not have substantial effects on rates of ecosystem respiration, this water table treatment had lower maximum respiration rates and a higher temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration than the control plot. Surface soil warming increased both ecosystem respiration and gross primary production by approximately 16% compared to control (ambient temperature) plots, with no net effect on net ecosystem exchange. Results from this rich fen manipulation suggest that fast responses to drought will include reduced ecosystem C storage driven by plant stress, whereas inundation will increase ecosystem C storage by stimulating plant growth.

AB Carbon (C) dynamics in northern peatlands are an important factor in the global C balance under climate change scenarios. They are microbially driven and influenced by the chemical composition of organic matter. Peatlands in the Rocky Mountains are usually formed on mineral sediments or developed with interbedded mineral lenses, which have been found to affect soil properties such as volumetric water content, pH, TOC and TN. Our objective was to investigate whethet the presence and relative depth of mineral horizons (i.e., stratified mineral horizons) affect microbial community structure and C composition, and in turn influence C mineralization. Three organic soil profile types were selected in the Sibbald research wetland of southwestern Alberta: peat over silty mineral over calcareous sediment (PMC), peat over silty mineral over peat (PMP), and sedge peat over moss peat profiles (PP). Peat samples were subjected to C composition and microbial community abundance and structure measurement and then incubated to test potential C mineralization. The main differences were detected in subsurface peat. In subsurface peat above mineral sediments (PMC, PMP) versus at equivalent depth in PP, the presence of a mineral horizon caused different C mineralization (mg C-CO2 kg(-1) soil) among soil types (PP > PMC and PMP). In addition, specific C mineralization (mg C-CO2 kg(-1) SOC) decreased with depth in subsurface peat in PP, but not in PMP, as greater volumetric water content (theta v) above the mineral horizon created anaerobic conditions in PMP. Microbial community structures also differed between PMP and PP due to different theta v in peat below mineral sediments. Recalcitrant C: labile C, bacteria: fungi, and microbial physiological stress were greatest in the subsurface peat above mineral sediments. Depth had an even greater effect: both C mineralization and microbial abundance decreased significantly with depth. Moreover, microbial community structure mainly grouped according to relative depth. Overall, our findings indicated that stratified mineral horizons affected C mineralization, microbial community structure, and peat chemistry in subsurface peat. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is an urgent need to include northern peatland hydrology in global Earth system models to better understand land-atmosphere interactions and sensitivities of peatland functions to climate change, and, ultimately, to improve climate change predictions. In this study, we introduced for the first time peatland-specific model physics into an assimilation scheme for L-band brightness temperature (Tb) data from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission to improve groundwater table estimates. We conducted two sets of model-only and data assimilation experiments using the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM), applying (over peatlands only) in one of them a peatland-specific adaptation (PEATCLSM). The evaluation against in-situ measurements of peatland groundwater table depth indicates the superiority of PEATCLSM model physics and additionally improved performance after assimilating SMOS Tb observations. The better performance of PEATCLSM over nearly all Northern Hemisphere peatlands is further supported by the better agreement between SMOS Tb observations and Tb estimates from the model-only and data assimilation runs. Within the data assimilation scheme, PEATCLSM reduces Tb observation-minus-forecast residuals and leads to reduced data assimilation updates of water storage components and, thus, reduced water budget imbalances in the assimilation system.

AB Northern peatlands are very sensitive to changes in climate. Impacts of increased temperatures on hydrology, vegetation structure and soil carbon are already well documented from northern peatlands. In contrast, effects of global warming on soil mites, and seasonal effects in particular, have received less attention, even though soil mites are an important component in ecosystems as they contribute to nutrient dynamics and decomposition. We investigated the impacts of long-term (16years) experimental seasonal climate manipulations (summer warming, winter warming with snow accumulation, and year-round warming) on oribatid (Oribatida) and mesostigmatid (Mesostigmata) mite communities in a peat bog underlain by discontinuous permafrost, in Abisko, Northern Sweden. We found that (1) Year-round warming treatment had neither impact on life-history trait compositions nor on total abundances of oribatid mites, possibly because of opposite effects of summer and winter warming; (2) Small-bodied oribatid mites, in particular those belonging to genera Suctobelba, increased in abundance under the summer warming treatment; (3) The species richness of oribatid mites was negative affected by year-round warming; (4) Mesostigmatid mites, which were not identified to species level, were found to decrease in abundance under year-round warming. Because different mite taxa with different body sizes and diets play distinct roles in carbon and nutrient dynamics, the observed changes in mite communities may impact ecosystem functions in northern peatlands.

AB Temporal drying of upper soil layers of acidic methanogenic peatlands might divert the flow of reductants from CH4 formation to other electron-accepting processes due to a renewal of alternative electron acceptors. In this study, we evaluated the in situ relevance of Fe(III)-reducing microbial activities in peatlands of a forested catchment that differed in their hydrology. Intermittent seeps reduced sequentially nitrate, Fe(III), and sulfate during periods of water saturation. Due to the acidic soil conditions, released Fe(II) was transported with the groundwater flow and accumulated as Fe(III) in upper soil layers of a lowland fen apparently due to oxidation. Microbial Fe(III) reduction in the upper soil layer accounted for 26.7 and 71.6% of the anaerobic organic carbon mineralization in the intermittent seep and the lowland fen, respectively. In an upland fen not receiving exogenous Fe, Fe(III) reduction contributed only to 6.7%. Fe(II) and acetate accumulated in deeper porewater of the lowland fen with maximum concentrations of 7 and 3 mM, respectively. Both supplemental glucose and acetate stimulated the reduction of Fe(III) indicating that fermentative, incomplete, and complete oxidizers were involved in Fe(II) formation in the acidic fen. Amplification of DNA yielded PCR products specific for Acidiphilium-, Geobacter-, and Geothrix-, but not for Shewanella- or Anaeroromyxobacter- related sequences. Porewater biogeochemistry observed during a 3-year-period suggests that increased drought periods and subsequent intensive rainfalls due to global climate change will further favor Fe(III) and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors due to the storage and enhanced re-oxidation of their reduced compounds in the soil.

AB We assessed the vulnerability of blanket peat to climate change in Great Britain using an ensemble of 8 bioclimatic envelope models. We used 4 published models that ranged from simple threshold models, based on total annual precipitation, to Generalised Linear Models (GLMs, based on mean annual temperature). In addition, 4 new models were developed which included measures of water deficit as threshold, classification tree, GLM and generalised additive models (GAM). Models that included measures of both hydrological conditions and maximum temperature provided a better fit to the mapped peat area than models based on hydrological variables alone. Under UKCIP02 projections for high (A1F1) and low (B1) greenhouse gas emission scenarios, 7 out of the 8 models showed a decline in the bioclimatic space associated with blanket peat. Eastern regions (Northumbria, North York Moors, Orkney) were shown to be more vulnerable than higher-altitude, western areas (Highlands, Western Isles and Argyle, Bute and The Trossachs). These results suggest a long-term decline in the distribution of actively growing blanket peat, especially under the high emissions scenario, although it is emphasised that existing peatlands may well persist for decades under a changing climate. Observational data from long-term monitoring and manipulation experiments in combination with process-based models are required to explore the nature and magnitude of climate change impacts on these vulnerable areas more fully.

AB Nitrogen and phosphorus were added experimentally in a bog in the southern Alps. It was hypothesized that alleviating nutrient limitation will increase vascular plant cover. As a consequence, more carbon will be fixed through higher rates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE).
   The vascular cover did increase at the expense of Sphagnum mosses. However, such vegetation changes were largely independent of the treatment and were probably triggered by an exceptional heatwave in summer 2003.
   Contrary to the tested hypothesis, NEE was unaffected by the nutrient treatments but was strongly influenced by temperature and water-table depth. In particular, ecosystem respiration in the hot summer of 2003 increased dramatically, presumably owing to enhanced heterotrophic respiration in an increased oxic peat layer.
   At the end of the experiment, the Sphagnum cover decreased significantly in the nitrogen-fertilized treatment at hummock microhabitats. In the long term, this will imply a proportionally greater accumulation of vascular litter, more easily decomposable than the recalcitrant Sphagnum litter. As a result, rates of carbon fixation may decrease because of stimulated respiration.

AB Variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation are determined by fractionation processes which occur during temperature- and humidity-dependent phase changes associated with evaporation and condensation. Oxygen stable isotope ratios have therefore been frequently used as a source of palaeoclimate data from a variety of proxy archives, which integrate this signal over time. Applications from ombrotrophic peatlands, where the source water used in cellulose synthesis is derived solely from precipitation, have been mostly limited to Northern Hemisphere Sphagnum-dominated bogs, with few in the Southern Hemisphere or in peatlands dominated by vascular plants. New Zealand (NZ) provides an ideal location to undertake empirical research into oxygen isotope fractionation in vascular peatlands because single taxon analysis can be easily carried out, in particular using the preserved root matrix of the restionaceous wire rush (Empodisma spp.) that forms deep Holocene peat deposits throughout the country. Furthermore, large gradients are observed in the mean isotopic composition of precipitation across NZ, caused primarily by the relative influence of different climate modes. Here, we test whether delta O-18 of Empodisma alpha-cellulose from ombrotrophic restiad peatlands in NZ can provide a methodology for developing palaeoclimate records of past precipitation delta O-18. Surface plant, water and precipitation samples were taken over spatial (six sites spanning >10 degrees latitude) and temporal (monthly measurements over one year) gradients. A link between the isotopic composition of root-associated water, the most likely source water for plant growth, and precipitation in both datasets was found. Back-trajectory modelling of precipitation moisture source for rain days prior to sampling showed clear seasonality in the temporal data that was reflected in root-associated water. The link between source water and plant cellulose was less clear, although mechanistic modelling predicted mean cellulose values within published error margins for both datasets. Improved physiological understanding and modelling of delta O-18 in restiad peatlands should enable use of this approach as a new source of palaeoclimate data to reconstruct changes in past atmospheric circulation.

AB Soil temperature is a major factor affecting organic matter decomposition and thus, global warming may accelerate decomposition processes. However, it remains unclear whether the effects will be similar in climatically different regions. The effects of soil temperatures of 5, 10 and 15 degrees C on the decomposition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles were assessed in a 1-year (360 days) growth chamber experiment. Intact peat cores from two climatically different peatland sites (southern and northern Finland) were used as the incubation environments. Needles were incubated in litter bags beneath the living moss layer, and mass loss and nitrogen (N) concentration were determined at 60-day intervals. The rate of mass loss from the needles over time was clearly lower in the 5 degrees C treatment than at the higher temperatures. Mass loss was strongly related to the accumulated soil temperature sum. In temperatures higher than 5 degrees C, mass losses were higher in the northern peat. Also, the limit value of decomposition (asymptotic maximum mass loss) was slightly higher in the northern peat (92%), than in the southern peat (87%). The N concentration increased up to a mass loss of 50-60%, whereupon it decreased, while the amount of N (as a percentage of the original amount) remained unchanged until a mass loss of 50-60%, whereupon it decreased linearly. It seems that increasing soil temperatures may result in slightly higher rates of needle litter mass loss and consequent N release in northern peat than in southern peat. The faster decomposition in higher temperatures in the northern peat, together with the slightly higher maximum mass loss value, imply that with climatic warming, susceptibility of boreal peatlands for becoming sources of carbon to the atmosphere may increase towards north.

AB Permafrost peatlands are both an important source of atmospheric CH4 and a substantial sink for atmospheric CO2. Climate change can affect this balance, with higher temperatures resulting in the conversion of permafrost soils to wetlands and associated accelerated mineralisation and increased CH4 emission. To better understand the impact of such processes on methanogen populations, we investigated the anaerobic decay of soil carbon in a low Arctic, discontinuous permafrost peatland. Cores were collected monthly from sedge and Sphagnum mires in north Sweden during the summer of 2006. We determined CH4 concentrations and production potentials, together with variations in the size of the methanogenic community as indicated by concentrations of archaeal lipid biomarkers (phosphorylated archaeol, archaeol and hydroxyarchaeol). Concentrations of methanogen biomarkers generally were higher at the sedge site, increased with depth for all sites and months, and were usually below the detection limits in shallow (<10cm) Sphagnum peat. The distribution of biomarkers reflects the strong influence of water table depth on anaerobic conditions and methanogen populations, while differences in biomarker concentrations can be explained by differences in vegetation cover and pH. However, methanogen populations inferred from biomarker data show a decoupling from in-situ CH4 production over the season and from CH4 production potential, suggesting that other factors such as the availability of labile organic substrates can influence methanogen abundance. Archaeal lipid biomarkers appear to offer a potential new means to investigate permafrost biogeochemical processes but the interpretation of signals remains complex.

AB Understanding the long-term ecological dynamics of boreal forests is essential for assessment of the possible responses and feedbacks of forest ecosystems to climate change. New data on past forest dynamics and peatland development were obtained from a peat sequence in the southern Valdai Hills (European Russia) based on pollen, plant macrofossil, micro-charcoal, peat humification, and testate amoeba analyses. The results demonstrate a dominance of broadleaved forests in the study area from 7000-4000 cal yr BP. Picea was initially a minor component of this forest but increased in cover rapidly with climatic cooling beginning at 4000 cal yr BP, becoming the dominant species. Broadleaved species persisted until 900 cal yr BP, with evidence for intensified felling and forest management over recent centuries. Over the last four hundred years there is evidence for widespread paludification and the establishment of Picea-Sphagnum forests. These data demonstrate how modern wet woodlands have been shaped by a combination of climatic and anthropogenic factors over several millennia. The results also demonstrate the value of a multiproxy approach in understanding long-term forest ecology.

AB A recently developed fluvial erosion model for blanket peatlands, PESERA-PEAT, was applied at ten sites across Great Britain to predict the response of blanket peat erosion to environmental change. Climate change to 2099 was derived from seven UKCP09 future projections and the UK Met Office's historical dataset. Land management scenarios were established based on outputs from earlier published investigations. Modelling results suggested that as climate changes, the response of blanket peat erosion will be spatially very variable across Great Britain. Both relative changes and absolute values of sediment yield were predicted to be higher in southern and eastern areas than in western and northern parts of Great Britain, peaking in the North York Moors of eastern England. Areas with high precipitation and low temperature were predicted to have low relative erosion changes and absolute sediment yield. The model suggested that summer desiccation may become more important for blanket peat erosion under future climate change, and that temperature was more dominant than precipitation in controlling long-term blanket peat erosion change. However, in the North York Moors, precipitation appeared to be more dominant in driving long-term erosion change. Land management measures were shown to provide a means to mitigate against the impacts of climate change on blanket peat erosion.

AB The destructive nature of the similar to 590 000 ha Horse river wildfire in the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), northern Alberta, in May of 2016 motivated the investigation of the hydrometeorological conditions that preceded the fire. Historical climate and field hydrometeorological data from a moderate-rich fen watershed were used to (a) identify whether the spring 2016 conditions were outside the range of natural variability for WBP climate cycles, (b) explain the observed patterns in burn severity across the watershed, and (c) identify whether fall and winter moisture signals observed in peatlands and lowland forests in the region are indicative of wildfire. Field hydrometeorological data from the fen watershed confirmed the presence of cumulative moisture deficits prior to the fire. Hydrogeological investigations highlighted the susceptibility of fen and upland areas to water table and soil moisture decline over rain-free periods (including winter), due to the watershed's reliance on supply from localized flow systems originating in topographic highs. Subtle changes in topographic position led to large changes in groundwater connectivity, leading to greater organic soil consumption by fire in wetland margins and at high elevations. The 2016 spring moisture conditions measured prior to the ignition of the fen watershed were not illustrated well by the Drought Code (DC) when standard overwintering procedures were applied. However, close agreement was found when default assumptions were replaced with measured duff soil moisture recharge and incorporated into the overwintering DC procedure. We conclude that accumulated moisture deficits dating back to the summer of 2015 led to the dry conditions that preceded the fire. The infrequent coinciding of several hydrometeorological conditions, including low autumn soil moisture, a modest snowpack, lack of spring precipitation, and high spring air temperatures and winds, ultimately led to the Horse river wildfire spreading widely and causing the observed burn patterns. Monitoring soil moisture at different land classes and watersheds would aid management strategies in the production of more accurate overwintered DC calculations, providing fire management agencies early warning signals ahead of severe spring wildfire seasons.

AB Peatlands, storing significant amounts of carbon, are extremely vulnerable to climate change. The effects of climate change are projected to lead to a vegetation shift from Sphagnum mosses to sedges and shrubs. Impacts on the present moss-dominated peat remain largely unknown. In this study, we used a multiproxy approach to investigate the influence of contrasting vascular plant types (sedges, shrubs) on peat chemistry and decomposition. Peat cores of 20 cm depth and plant material (Sphagnum spp., Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum) from two ombrotrophic peatlands in the Italian Alps with a mean annual temperature difference of 1.4 degrees C were analyzed. Peat cores were taken under adjacent shrub and sedge plants growing at the same height above the water table. We used carbon, nitrogen and their stable isotopes to assess general patterns in the degree of decomposition across sampling locations and depths. In addition, analytical pyrolysis was applied to disentangle effects of vascular plants (sedge, shrub) on chemical properties and decomposition of the moss-dominated peat.
   Pyrolysis data confirmed that Sphagnum moss dominated the present peat irrespective of depth. Nevertheless, vascular plants contributed to peat properties as revealed by, e.g., pyrolysis products of lignin. The degree of peat decomposition increased with depth as shown by, e.g., decreasing amounts of the pyrolysis product of sphagnum acid and increasing delta C-13 with depth. Multiple parameters also revealed a higher degree of decomposition of Sphagnum-dominated peat collected under sedges than under shrubs, particularly at the high temperature site. Surprisingly, temperature effects on peat decomposition were less pronounced than those of sedges. Our results imply that vascular plants affect the decomposition of the existing peat formed by Sphagnum, particularly at elevated temperature. These results suggest that changes in plant functional types may have a stronger impact on the soil carbon feedback in a warmer world than hitherto assumed.

AB Decreasing snow cover in winter resulting from climate warming increases the incidence of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) in many ecosystems, including peatlands. As peatland ecosystems form a globally significant long-term carbon storage, understanding the effects of changing conditions in winter on carbon dynamics is essential. We studied how FTCs affect peatland carbon cycling by conducting mesocosm experiments with Sphagnum. Our results indicate an overall impeding effect of FTCs on Sphagnum photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, ecosystem respiration and enzymatic processes. A threefold reduction in photosynthesis in the FTC treatment was related to a decrease in chlorophyll content, showing that Sphagnum physiologically suffers from repeated FTCs. In the FTC treatment beta-glucosidase and phosphatase enzymatic activities decreased by 50% and 30%, respectively, whilst alanine remained unaffected, indicating that in peat soils short-term FTCs affect the carbon and phosphorus cycles, but not the nitrogen cycle. Long-term effects of FTCs deserve further studies.

AB Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) and its components, gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), were compared between a bog and an abandoned peatland pasture within the same peatland complex in western Newfoundland, Canada. Measurements based on the eddy covariance technique from April 2014 to April 2016 were used to examine the influence of agricultural management and abandonment on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange. NEE, GPP and ER at both sites showed pronounced seasonal variation, peaking near the middle growing season. The maximum net CO2 uptake rate of -28.61 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and emission rate of 14.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at the pasture were significantly higher than those at the bog (-9.67 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 5.50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively). Daytime average GPP was related to photosynthetic photon flux density and air temperature and the nighttime average ER decreased with soil water content, but increased with surface soil temperature for both sites. Annual NEE of the pasture (-128 +/- 60 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and -124 +/- 56 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16) was considerably larger than that of the bog (-46 +/- 36 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15). GPP of 1086 +/- 141 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 982 +/- 123 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 and ER of 957 129 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014-15 and 858 +/- 112 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015-16 at the pasture were approximately twice the magnitude of the corresponding fluxes at the bog. The difference in GPP between the bog and pasture was mainly related to their different aboveground biomass. Higher ER at the pasture was probably related to its lower water table depth, greater substrate availability and higher autotrophic respiration. Unlike previous findings that managed peat lands are large CO2 emitters, our results suggest that abandoned peatland pastures can function like natural grasslands and sequester considerable amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.

AB Palsas and peat plateaus are climatically sensitive landforms in permafrost peatlands. Climate envelope models have previously related palsa/peat plateau distributions in Europe to modern climate, but similar bioclimatic modelling has not been attempted for North America. Recent climate change has rendered many palsas/peat plateaus in this region, and their valuable carbon stores, vulnerable. We fitted a binary logistic regression model to predict palsa/peat plateau presence for North America by relating the distribution of 352 extant landforms to gridded modern climate data. Our model accurately classified 85.3% of grid cells that contain observed palsas/peat plateaus and 77.1% of grid cells without observed palsas/ peat plateaus. The model indicates that modern North American palsas/peat plateaus are supported by cold, dry climates with large seasonal temperature ranges and mild growing seasons. We used palaeoclimate simulations from a general circulation model to simulate Holocene distributions of palsas/peat plateaus at 500-year intervals. We constrained these outputs with timings of peat initiation, deglaciation, and postglacial drainage across the continent. Our palaeoclimate simulations indicate that this climate envelope remained stationary in western North America throughout the Holocene, but further east it migrated northwards during 11.5-6.0 Ka BP. However, palsa extents in eastern North America were restricted from following this moving climate envelope by late deglaciation, drainage and peat initiation. We validated our Holocene simulations against available palaeoecological records and whilst they agree that permafrost peatlands aggraded earliest in western North America, our simulations contest previous suggestions that late permafrost aggradation in central Canada was climatically-driven.

AB A 2700-year-old peat core from the southern West Siberian Lowlands was used to reconstruct past water-table depth using testate amoeba analysis and to compare hydrological changes with temperature variations associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age', and 20th-century warming. The robustness of water-table results was assessed using comparisons of four separate transfer functions, a testate amoeba reconstruction from an additional site in southern West Siberia, and an independent hydrological proxy of the C-13 values of Sphagnum remains from the same core. The paleohydrology results were robust in that (1) all four transfer functions returned similar results, (2) both peatland sites displayed very similar water-table fluctuations despite their distance from each other, and (3) Sphagnum C-13 values showed similar overall changes as the testate amoeba-inferred hydrology, but at a coarser temporal resolution. When comparing reconstructed hydrology in southern West Siberia to Northern Hemisphere temperatures, we found that during most of the record warmer time intervals tended to be wet locally and cooler time intervals tended to be dry including during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (similar to 1150-650cal. BP). This pairing continued until the Little Ice Age' (similar to 650-100cal. BP) when conditions became cool and wet, and recently, conditions have become warm again, but unlike the earlier wet interval, the peatlands have dried. Drier conditions shown by the water-table depth reconstruction suggest that future warming may continue the drying of southern peatland surfaces in the West Siberian Lowlands and may promote peat carbon respiration.

AB Terrestrial and aquatic ecological productivity are often nutrient limited in subarctic permafrost environments. High latitude regions are experiencing significant climatic change, including rapid warming and changing precipitation patterns, which may result in changes in nutrient dynamics within terrestrial and aquatic systems and hydrochemical transport between them. The objective of this research was to characterize changes in runoff quantity and quality within, and between peatlands and ponds throughout the snow-free summer season. Two ponds and their catchments were monitored over the snow-free season to measure changes in hydrologic storage, and to determine how water chemistry changed with the evolution of the frost table depth. Thresholds in hydrologic storage combined with frost table position (which inhibited infiltration and storage) produced nonlinear responses for runoff generation through highly conductive shallow peat layers while deeper, less conductive layers retarded flow. Greater inputs were required to exceed hydrologic storage (fill and spill) as a deepening frost table increased the hydrologically active portion of the soil, leading to seasonal variability in runoff pathways between peatlands and ponds. Runoff contributions to ponds were an integral component of the snow-free water balance during the study period, contributing up to 60% of all snow-free inputs. Groundwater chemistry (and pond chemistry following runoff events when ponds were connected with peatlands) reflected the different depths of peat and mineral soil accessed throughout the season. This work has improved scientific understanding of the combined controls of hydrologic inputs and ground frost on runoff and nutrient transport between peatlands and ponds, and sheds insight into how nutrient dynamics in cold regions may evolve under a changing climate.

AB Peatland is a significant ecosystem that has accumulated one-third of the soil carbon in boreal regions. However, the net carbon balance, particularly with current carbon emissions, remains unclear. In this study, the annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from a peatland located in Northeast China are reported. Ecosystem respiration fluxes from the shrub-moss-and Eriophorum-dominated communities in the peatland varied from 12 to 272 mg Cm-2 h(-2) during the snow-free season, and the Eriophorumdominated community emitted more CO2. Rates of ecosystem respiration were strongly regulated by temperature and water table depth. The CH4 fluxes emitted from the peatland throughout a year varied with the type of the vegetation community during the snow-free season. No distinct episodic CH4 efflux during the freeze-thaw cycles was observed from the shrub-moss-dominated community, whereas a subtle pulse of CH4 was found in the Eriophorum-dominated community. The annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from the peatland were 356 and 1.51 g Cm-2 per year, respectively. The contributions of CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the snowy season to annual emissions were much lower than those found in other boreal peatlands, whereas 24% of the annual methane flux was emitted during the freeze-thaw cycles. The results highlight the importance of gaseous carbon efflux in the estimation of carbon flux from peatlands, as well as the contribution of carbon efflux during the snow-covered season.

AB Plant community modification may play an important role in peatlands' carbon balance. We investigated how Molinia caerulea altered CO2 and CH4 fluxes and DOC concentration as well as their sensitivity to water table level, air and soil temperature in Sphagnum-dominated peat mesocosms. The presence of Molinia caerulea significantly increased CO2 and CH4 emissions compared to Sphagnum and decreased the DOC concentration. The rise in temperature exponentially increased DOC as well as CO2 and CH4 emissions. Molinia caerulea decreased the temperature sensitivity of CO2 emissions, suggesting the presence of a more labile substrate (root exudates), while it increased the temperature sensitivity of CH4 emissions, suggesting a possible change in methanogenic communities. Our study highlights a strong impact of vegetation change on C dynamics in peatlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands store substantial amounts of carbon and are vulnerable to climate change. We present a modified version of the Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) land surface model for simulating the hydrology, surface energy, and CO2 fluxes of peatlands on daily to annual timescales. The model includes a separate soil tile in each 0.5 degrees grid cell, defined from a global peatland map and identified with peat-specific soil hydraulic properties. Runoff from non-peat vegetation within a grid cell containing a fraction of peat is routed to this peat soil tile, which maintains shallow water tables. The water table position separates oxic from anoxic decomposition. The model was evaluated against eddy-covariance (EC) observations from 30 northern peatland sites, with the maximum rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) being optimized at each site. Regarding short-term day-to-day variations, the model performance was good for gross primary production (GPP) (r(2) = 0.76; Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency, MEF = 0.76) and ecosystem respiration (ER, r(2) = 0.78, MEF = 0.75), with lesser accuracy for latent heat fluxes (LE, r(2) = 0.42, MEF = 0.14) and and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE, r(2) = 0.38, MEF = 0.26). Seasonal variations in GPP, ER, NEE, and energy fluxes on monthly scales showed moderate to high r(2) values (0.57-0.86). For spatial across-site gradients of annual mean GPP, ER, NEE, and LE, r(2) values of 0.93, 0.89, 0.27, and 0.71 were achieved, respectively. Water table (WT) variation was not well predicted (r(2) < 0.1), likely due to the uncertain water input to the peat from surrounding areas. However, the poor performance of WT simulation did not greatly affect predictions of ER and NEE. We found a significant relationship between optimized V-cmax and latitude (temperature), which better reflects the spatial gradients of annual NEE than using an average V-cmax value.

AB Sphagnum expansion to alkaline fens has accelerated during the last decades in Europe, leading to changes in diversity, habitat distributions and carbon storage. The causes are still not clearly understood and involve an interplay between climate change, hydrology, nutrient supply and Sphagnum physiology. We conducted a 4-year field experiment in eight fens in Central European highlands and assessed survival and establishment of individual apical shoot fragments of S.flexuosum, S. warnstorfii and S. squarrosum transplanted along the microtopographical gradient. In a laboratory experiment, we tested combined effects of desiccation and high calcium bicarbonate concentration on Sphagnum survival. We found that in unflooded positions, living shoots of Sphagnum and brown mosses lowered [Ca2+] and pH in their capillary water, in contrast to dead fragments; yet without differences between species. Survival and expansion of Sphagnum fragments, which did not die of acute calcium toxicity during first weeks/months, was negatively affected by dry weather and alkaline water chemistry, reflecting Sphagnum intolerance to desiccation and to combined high [Ca2+] and pH. Shoot fragments expanded to patches only when precipitation was high. Interestingly, non-toxic concentration of calcium bicarbonate reduced desiccation damage in Sphagnum, probably through protection of membranes or other cell components. This mechanism would facilitate Sphagnum survival in elevated, frequently desiccated microhabitats of calcareous fens such as brown-moss hummocks. However, since water-retaining capacity of few Sphagnum shoots is insufficient to change water chemistry in its surroundings, surface acidification may occur only once the environment (e.g. sufficient humidity) enabled expansion to larger mats. Then, the retained rainwater together with hardly decomposable Sphagnum litter would separate mire surface from groundwater, speeding up successional shift towards poor fens. Sphagnum expansion to alkaline fens is therefore more likely in humid regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forested peatlands represent an important global carbon pool, storing 48.0 Pg of carbon within continental western Canada alone. Peatland hydrology regulates the carbon dynamics and future stability of this carbon store and provides a critical control on regional water dynamics. Drying associated with land-use change and climate change has the potential to increase tree growth, modifying the density, size, and spatial arrangement of trees. This can reduce peatland evaporation and offset the associated increase in transpiration. To determine the magnitude of this negative ecohydrological feedback, we simulated spatial variations in radiation, turbulent energy fluxes, and temperatures in peatlands with real and idealized tree densities and distributions. For a random tree distribution, an increase in tree density from 0 to 4 trees per m(2) reduced available energy at the peat surface, decreasing average evaporation by 25%. At higher tree densities, feather moss species covered a larger fraction of the ground because of lower light availability. In combination with the lower energy availability, this change in moss composition reduced evaporation by similar to 70%. The reduction in evaporation was greater (83%) when the effects of increased canopy cover on peatland aerodynamic properties were incorporated. Additionally, we found that evaporation was dependent on the spatial arrangement of trees, with evaporation being higher when trees were clustered. Overall, our model showed that the trade-off between reduced evaporation and increased transpiration with increasing tree densities reduced landscape variation in evapotranspiration, with simulated evapotranspiration remaining approximately constant across a broad range of peatland ecosystems despite varying canopy densities.

TI The influence of climate on peatland extent in Western Siberia since the
   Last Glacial Maximum
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID CARBON; MODEL; ACCUMULATION; WETLANDS
AB Boreal and subarctic peatlands are an important dynamical component of the earth system. They are sensitive to climate change, and could either continue to serve as a carbon sink or become a carbon source. Climatic thresholds for switching peatlands from sink to source are not well defined, and therefore, incorporating peatlands into Earth system models is a challenging task. Here we introduce a climatic index, warm precipitation excess, to delineate the potential geographic distribution of boreal peatlands for a given climate and landscape morphology. This allows us to explain the present-day distribution of peatlands in Western Siberia, their absence during the Last Glacial Maximum, their expansion during the mid-Holocene, and to form a working hypothesis about the trend to peatland degradation in the southern taiga belt of Western Siberia under an RCP 8.5 scenario for the projected climate in year 2100.

AB Mid-to-late Holocene high-resolution testate amoebae-derived water table reconstructions from two peatlands in the North of Ireland are presented The proxy climate records are dated and correlated using a combination of AMS C-14 dating, spheroidal carbonaceous particles and tephrochronology. The reconstructions start prior to the Hekla 4 tephra isochron (2395-2279 BC) and thus span the last similar to 4500 years The records are compiled by the process of tuning within chronological errors, standardisation and stacking. Comparisons are made to existing palaeoclimate records from peatlands in Northern Britain and Ireland and the compiled lake-level record for mid-latitude Europe. Four coherent dry phases are identified in the records at ca 1150-800 BC, 320 BC-AD 150, AD 250-470 and AD 1850-2000. Recent research has shown that peat-derived water table reconstructions reflect summer water deficit and therefore the dry phases are interpreted as periods with a higher frequency and/or greater magnitudes of summer drought. These 'drought phases' occur during periods of relatively low C-14 production, which may add support to the hypothesis of persistent solar forcing of climate change during the Holocene Any relationship with the North Atlantic stacked drift ice record is less clear.

AB In three Scandinavian peatlands we studied to what extent plant and microbial community compositions are governed by local-scale microhabitat, with a special interest in the effect of aspect (i.e. exposition of slopes). Despite differences in solar irradiance between the south- and north-facing slopes, maximum temperature was elevated in the south-facing slopes at the most northern site only. Pore-water nutrient concentrations were not affected by aspect, yet dissolved organic carbon concentrations were higher in the south-facing microhabitats. This was likely caused by higher vascular plant biomass. Plant and microbial community composition clearly differed among sites. In all three sites, microhabitat (i.e. prevailing water-table depth) affected the plant and microbial community compositions. Aspect, however, did not affect community composition, even though microclimate significantly differed between the south- and the north-facing aspects at the northernmost site. Our results highlight the complex link between plant community composition, microbial community and environmental conditions, which deserves much more attention than currently in order to fully understand the effects of climate change on peatland ecosystem function.

AB The distribution and abundance of Sphagnum spores in North America and Eurasia are mapped for the past 21 ka. The present-day distribution of abundant Sphagnum spores corresponds closely to areas with peatland development, with maximum Sphagnum abundance between 630 and 1300 mm annual precipitation and between -2 degrees and 6 degreesC mean annual air temperature. During the Wisconsin glaciation, there were apparently not large areas of peatland in North America, except in Alaska. High Sphagnum spore percentages were found in eastern North America during deglaciation. Major peatland development occurred in boreal North America after 9 ka and there was a southward movement of high Sphagnum spore abundance after 5 ka in the western Great Lakes region. Major peatland development began after 9 ka in Europe and Asia. On the basis of maps of the area supporting peatlands, carbon accumulation in peatlands is estimated to be low prior to 11 ka, increased slightly between 11 and 5 ka, and greatly increased during the past 5 ka.

AB A peat deposit (Zennare basin, Venice coastland, Italy) was monitored in previous field studies to investigate the hydrological response of organic soil to meteorological dynamics. Field tests and modelling predictions highlighted the risk of the complete loss of this peat layer during the next 50 years, due to oxidation enhanced by the increased frequency of warmer periods. Unfortunately, despite the considerable impacts that are expected to affect peat bogs (in this area and worldwide), only a few experimental studies have been carried out to assess the hydrologic response of peat to severe water scarcity. Because of that, an undisturbed 0.7 m(3) peat monolith was collected, transferred to the laboratory and instrumented. The total weight (representative of the water content dynamics of the peat monolith as a whole), and two vertical profiles of matric potentials and water content were monitored in controlled water-scarce conditions. After an extended air-drying period, the monolith was used as an undisturbed peat lysimeter and a complete cycle of wetting and drainage was performed. Supplementary measurements of matric potential psi and water content theta were collected by testing peat subsamples on a suction table apparatus. A set of water retention curves was determined in a range of matric potentials broader (psi down to -7 m) than the current natural conditions in the field (minimum psi = -1 m). While water content at saturation showed values similar to those in the original natural conditions (theta approximately equal to 0.8), a remarkable loss of water holding capacity (even for low potentials) has been highlighted, especially in deep layers that are now permanently below the water table. The retention curves changed shape and values, with a more pronounced hysteresis visible in an increasing distance between wetting and drying data. Hydraulic non-equilibrium between the water content and water potential could be a possible cause and it is worth modelling in future studies. The parameters of the van Genuchten retention curves were obtained for the wetting and the drying phases.

AB Decomposition of organic substances is one of the main processes responsible for the signatures of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in soils and peats. However, the applicability of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures at the natural abundance level as indicators of the degree of peat decomposition is still debatable. We evaluated delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth patterns of peat cores sampled at nine sites in two nearby Alpine peat bogs with varying degree of organic matter degradation. Based on water table depths and past drainage intensities, the peat cores were divided into three degradation classes. We found similar overall depths patterns of delta C-13 and delta N-15 across the nine depth profiles and distinct differences between aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. Considerable differences in stable C and N isotope signatures of same depths were detected between profiles of the three classes, whereas depth profiles of peat cores with similar degree in peatland degradation were nearly identical. In the aerobic peat layers, delta C-13 and delta N-15 increased with depths at all study sites from 2.6 parts per thousand to 4.9 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 3.2 parts per thousand to 7.0 parts per thousand for delta N-15 compared to the initial signatures of the plant biomass. Standardised delta C-13 of aerobic layers differ distinctly between slightly degraded pests at the open peat bog area, intermediately degraded peats at the tree-covered edge areas and strongly degraded pests at the former peat-cutting site. delta C-13 signatures of aerobic layers of strongly degraded pests were markedly more negative compared to the slightly degraded peats because of the selective C-12 losses by microbial respiration. delta N-15 were more positive at strongly degraded than at slightly degraded sites in both, aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. The uniform stable isotope ratios in the anaerobic layers deeper than the local maxima of the isotopic signatures support the assumption that minor C-13 fractionation occurs under anaerobic conditions. delta C-13 slightly declining with depth in the waterlogged layers of strongly degraded peat reflects the preferential utilisation and loss of labile organic compounds enriched in C-13. delta N-15 of strongly degraded pests was higher compared to well-conserved peat The close relationship between the measured delta N-15 to delta N-15 modelled based on C:N ratios and bulk densities supports the assumption that the delta N-15 signature is the result of isotopic fractionation by peat decomposition. We conclude that peat decomposition strongly affects the delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth profiles of peat bogs and most likely overrides other factors, such as differences between plant species, litter components, atmospheric delta C-13 shift during peat formation, temperature effects, or type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.

AB Peatlands are among the largest natural sources of atmospheric methane (CH4) worldwide. Peatland emissions are projected to increase under climate change, as rising temperatures and shifting precipitation accelerate microbial metabolic pathways favorable for CH(4)production. However, how these changing environmental factors will impact peatland emissions over the long term remains unknown. Here, we investigate a novel data set spanning an exceptionally long 11 years to analyze the influence of soil temperature and water table elevation on peatland CH(4)emissions. We show that higher water tables dampen the springtime increases in CH(4)emissions as well as their subsequent decreases during late summer to fall. These results imply that any hydroclimatological changes in northern peatlands that shift seasonal water availability from winter to summer will increase annual CH(4)emissions, even if temperature remains unchanged. Therefore, advancing hydrological understanding in peatland watersheds will be crucial for improving predictions of CH(4)emissions.

The CI-T reconstruction is well dated, and corresponds well with the only two other CI-T records for Britain. Comparisons are made with BSW records from northern Britain, which show consistent similarities over centennial to millennial timescales, demonstrating that at this resolution cooler summers equated with a wetter climate, at least during the mid- to late-Holocene.

AB Mullite, a pure aluminosilicate (Al6Si2O13), is a rare natural rock component, known for centuries as a very resistant ceramic material. It is also a common waste product of high-temperature coal combustion that is emitted in quantity from coal-based power stations. The occurrence of mullite in two Sphagnum-dominated peatlands located near the Upper Silesia industrial region in southern Poland is described. For the first time, a complete record of mullite deposition in the peat profiles has been obtained by XRD analyses of ashed peat samples. The mullite distribution is compared with records of Hg, Pb and Cu. While mullite is supplied during high temperature processes only, Cu, Pb and Hg show more complex pattern of distribution. Both peat profiles contain elevated amounts of mullite in the time span between ca 1950-1990 with a maximum content in ca 1980. The first appearance (similar to 1900) of mullite is indicative of the beginning of energy production in coal-based power plants in the region. Mullite is proposed here as an indicator of industrialization in geological records. It is resistant to post-depositional processes, emitted globally, and restricted to large-scale industry.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key component of the carbon cycle and has significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems and potable water treatment. Upward trends in river and lacaustrine DOC concentrations have been observed and a number of key drivers have been proposed. Here, we present DOC concentration data from plot scale pore waters at one site and surface water from artificial drains sampled within a national survey which demonstrate a significant correlation between peatland vegetation type and DOC concentration. Calluna dominance was associated with the highest DOC concentration, Molinia and Sphagnum dominance with lower concentrations, and sedge dominance with intermediate concentrations. Water sampled from drains dominated by Calluna had greater DOC concentrations than water sampled from pore waters in plots dominated by Calluna. In contrast DOC concentrations from plots dominated by sedges were greater than those sampled from drains dominated by sedges. We discuss these findings in relation to plant functional traits and their influence on the physical and biotic conditions that regulate DOC concentrations. Given the known effects of management activities and climate change on peatland vegetation composition there is potential to manage plant community composition to ameliorate the observed rising DOC concentration.

AB Understanding peat carbon dynamics in the past is of significance, given the uncertainties as to whether there will be an increase or a reduction in carbon as a result of future climate change. Studies of peat carbon dynamics have primarily been conducted in monsoon-influenced China. However, data relating to carbon dynamics in peat deposits has not yet been investigated in Westerlies-influenced Northwest China (NWC). In this study, the Holocene carbon accumulation rate (CAR) is explored at the Tuolehaite peat core, with a mean rate of growth of 2.4 yr mm(-1), 0.4 mm yr(-1), in the high-elevation Altai Mountains within NWC. Its CAR shows a decreasing trend, ranging from 4.8 to 68.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with a mean of 28.0 g C m(-2) yr(-1) since the Holocene epoch. Comparisons of the CAR in the Westerlies-influenced NWC with that in the monsoon-influenced Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Northeast China, and South China, reveal that the Holocene CAR trend in relatively high-elevation peat deposits (e.g. Tuolehaite Peat and Hongyuan Peat) is opposite to that found in relatively low-elevation peat deposits (e.g. Hani Peat and Dahu Peat). Different driving factors (temperature and precipitation) of CAR could be responsible for these opposing trends. To be specific, temperature is the main driving factor influencing the CAR in relatively high-elevation peat deposits, whereas precipitation is the key driving factor controlling the CAR in relatively low-elevation peat deposits. Our work indicates that comprehensive investigations into peat CARs in both Westerlies-influenced and monsoon-influenced regions contribute to an understanding of the peat CAR pattern in China as a whole.

AB Uncertainty regarding changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quantity and quality has created interest in managing peatlands for their ecosystem services such as drinking water provision. The evidence base for such interventions is, however, sometimes contradictory. We performed a laboratory climate manipulation using a factorial design on two dominant peatland vegetation types (Calluna vulgaris and Sphagnum Spp.) and a peat soil collected from a drinking water catchment in Exmoor National Park, UK. Temperature and rainfall were set to represent baseline and future conditions under the UKCP09 2080s high emissions scenario for July and August. DOC leachate then underwent standard water treatment of coagulation/flocculation before chlorination. C. vulgaris leached more DOC than Sphagnum Spp. (7.17 versus 3.00 mg g(-1)) with higher specific ultraviolet (SUVA) values and a greater sensitivity to climate, leaching more DOC under simulated future conditions. The peat soil leached less DOC (0.37 mg g(-1)) than the vegetation and was less sensitive to climate. Differences in coagulation removal efficiency between the DOC sources appears to be driven by relative solubilisation of protein-like DOC, observed through the fluorescence peak C/T. Post-coagulation only differences between vegetation types were detected for the regulated disinfection by-products (DBPs), suggesting climate change influence at this scale can be removed via coagulation. Our results suggest current biodiversity restoration programmes to encourage Sphagnum Spp. will result in lower DOC concentrations and SUVA values, particularly with warmer and drier summers.

AB Climate change is predicted to cause an increase in frequency and severity of droughts in the boreal ecozone, which can result in the lowering of water tables and subsequent release of acidic, metal-contaminated waters from wetlands. We believe that in areas where historical deposition of metals and sulphur was severe, these episodic pulses of metals could reach concentrations sufficiently high to severely affect aquatic communities in receiving waters and cause a delay in biological recovery. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of drought on the chemistry of water draining from two Sudbury peatlands with widely contrasting peat organic matter content to determine the response of stream water chemistry to drought from peatland types in the region. Stream samples were collected using ISCO (TM) automated water collectors from June to November 2011. Following a period of drought, there was a decline in pH and a large increase in concentrations of sulphate and metal ions (Al, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in water draining both peatlands, with extreme concentrations occurring over a period of about two weeks. At the site with the higher peat organic matter content there was an increase in metals that have a high affinity to bind to DOC (Al, Cu, and Fe) during the onset of drought. This study demonstrates a dramatic response to drought at two sites that differ in metal and nutrient pool sizes, hydrology, and topography, suggesting the potential for a majority of peatlands in the region to experience this response. Efforts to restore aquatic ecosystems and protect freshwater resources must take into account these processes, as disruptions to biogeochemical cycles are likely to become more prevalent in a changing climate.

AB Peatlands are often regarded as metal repositories, but under drought conditions may switch from sinks to sources of metals and contaminate downstream ecosystems. To evaluate whether the release of metals into soil solution in peatlands is predictable using simple, widely available soil parameters, six peatlands, with varying levels of metal contamination, including a previously limed peatland, were sampled around the Sudbury, Ontario, region, and were subjected to simulated drought. The simulated drought lowered soil water pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, which is consistent with field observations. Metal partitioning (K-d) values for Co, Mn, Ni, and Zn, with just one exception at one peatland, could be significantly predicted by just the pH of the soil water, although the strength of the relationship varied considerably among sites. The metal speciation model WHAM VII predicted that the free metal ion concentration of all metals tested, including Cu and Al, increased significantly with decreasing pH. At the same time, DOC-bound metal concentrations were predicted to decrease as DOC levels were lower, which for metals with strong organic matter affinities (Cu and Al) offset the increase in free metal ion concentration in soil solution following summer drought. Climate change forecasts for more frequent and sustained droughts may promote metal release from peatlands and increased mobilization to surface waters, and importantly, for some metals, the potential toxicity of the metals released from peatlands may increase to a greater extent than expected from increases in total metal concentrations because of decreased DOC following drought.

AB This study uses a 12-year time series (2001-2012) of eddy covariance measurements to investigate the long-term net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) and inter-annual variations in relation to abiotic drivers in a boreal fen in northern Sweden. The peatland was a sink for atmospheric CO2 in each of the twelve study years with a 12-year average (+/- standard deviation) NEE of -58 +/- 21 g C m(-2) yr(-1). For ten out of twelve years, the cumulative annual NEE was within a range of -42 to -79 g C m(-2) yr(-1) suggesting a general state of resilience of NEE to moderate inter-annual climate variations. However, the annual NEE of -18 and -106 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2006 and 2008, respectively, diverged considerably from this common range. The lower annual CO2 uptake in 2006 was mainly due to late summer emissions related to an exceptional drop in water table level (WTL). A positive relationship (R-2 = 0.65) between pre-growing season (January to April) air temperature (Ta) and summer (June to July) gross ecosystem production (GEP) was observed. We suggest that enhanced GEP due to mild pre-growing season air temperature in combination with air temperature constraints on ecosystem respiration (ER) during the following cooler summer explained most of the greater net CO2 uptake in 2008. Differences in the annual and growing season means of other abiotic variables (e.g. radiation, vapor pressure deficit, precipitation) and growing season properties (i.e. start date, end date, length) were unable to explain the inter-annual variations of NEE. Overall, our findings suggest that this boreal fen acts as a persistent contemporary sink for atmospheric CO2 that is, however, susceptible to severe anomalies in WTL and pre-growing season air temperature associated with predicted changes in climate patterns for the boreal region.

AB The role of plant phenology as a regulator for gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) in peatlands is empirically not well constrained. This is because proxies to track vegetation development with daily coverage at the ecosystem scale have only recently become available and the lack of such data has hampered the disentangling of biotic and abiotic effects. This study aimed at unraveling the mechanisms that regulate the seasonal variation in GEP across a network of eight European peatlands. Therefore, we described phenology with canopy greenness derived from digital repeat photography and disentangled the effects of radiation, temperature and phenology on GEP with commonality analysis and structural equation modeling. The resulting relational network could not only delineate direct effects but also accounted for possible effect combinations such as interdependencies (mediation) and interactions (moderation). We found that peatland GEP was controlled by the same mechanisms across all sites: phenology constituted a key predictor for the seasonal variation in GEP and further acted as a distinct mediator for temperature and radiation effects on GEP. In particular, the effect of air temperature on GEP was fully mediated through phenology, implying that direct temperature effects representing the thermoregulation of photosynthesis were negligible. The tight coupling between temperature, phenology and GEP applied especially to high latitude and high altitude peatlands and during phenological transition phases. Our study highlights the importance of phenological effects when evaluating the future response of peatland GEP to climate change. Climate change will affect peatland GEP especially through changing temperature patterns during plant phenologically sensitive phases in high latitude and high altitude regions.

AB During the last decades, various renaturation programmes have been initialized to recover nutrient sink and ecological functions of peatlands by rewetting. Rewetting, however, often results in the formation of hotspots for methane (CH4) emissions and in temporal dieback of local vegetation. The present study aimed at quantifying changes of CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a peatland currently under continuous rewetting conditions. Emissions where studied at a permanently flooded site and a non-flooded peat site with fluctuating water tables by using common closed chamber method. The permanently flooded site revealed extremely high CH4 emissions (up to 1195 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) which were positively correlated with temperature, nutrient content, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentration of the peat soil water. In contrast, the non-flooded peat site, with lower and fluctuating water tables (WT), showed significantly lower CH4 emissions and an increasing trend of CH4 release associated with a generally increasing WT caused by the progressing rewetting process. Lower N2O emissions (< 24 A mu g N m(-2) d(-1)) were observed at the flooded site. By contrast, the non-flooded peat site with fluctuating WT showed significantly higher N2O emissions (up to 4178 A mu g N m(-2) d(-1)), in particular at high temperatures during summer time. The present results indicate that permanently flooded conditions during rewetting processes might cause higher CH4 emissions compared to fluctuating WT which in contrast might enhance N2O emissions. In total, however, no decreasing trend for CH4 emissions throughout the five-year renaturation period could be found. At least for N2O we observed a decreasing trend during rewetting.

AB Hydrochernical sampling of South Pennine (UK) headwater streams draining eroded upland peatlands demonstrates these systems are nitrogen saturated, with significant leaching of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), particularly ammonium, during both stormflow and baseflow conditions. DIN leaching at sub-catchment scale is controlled by geomorphological context; in catchments with low gully densities ammonium leaching dominates whereas highly gullied catchments leach ammonium and nitrate since lower water tables and increased aeration encourages nitrification. Stormflow flux calculations indicate that: approximately equivalent amounts of nitrate are deposited and exported; ammonium export significantly exceeds atmospheric inputs. This suggests two ammonium sources: high atmospheric loadings; and mineralisation of organic nitrogen stored in peat. Downstream trends indicate rapid transformation of leached ammonium into nitrate. It is important that low-order headwater streams are adequately considered when assessing impacts of atmospheric loads on the hydrochemistry of stream networks, especially with respect to erosion, climate change and reduced precipitation.

ID TABLE DRAW-DOWN; FOREST; SOILS; MODEL
AB Considerations and analyses of the consequences of climate change on hydrological processes focus on projections and predictions of the future runoff behaviour, potential risk of flooding, and groundwater recharge. Nature conservationists have tried both at national and regional levels to predict - mainly from changes in air temperature - shifts in species ranges and derive the extinction risks of species from their temperature preferences (CHMIELEWSKI et al. 2005, POMPE et al. 2009). Much less attention was granted to the site as an aggregate of all abiotic factors influencing vegetation. However, it must be presumed that climate change will alter - next to temperature - other site factors as well; in the first instance the water balance at the site (HERBST & HORMANN 1998). Fens, like all other water-influenced biotopes, depend in their emergence, distribution, form, and their ecological valuation closely on the regional and local water balance. That is why one expects that climate change will profoundly influence these habitats and their species communities (IPCC 2001). Because of their adaptation to a certain water-balance regime under a specific combination of the factors temperature", precipitation", and evaporation", plants are particularly vulnerable by climate change (DAWSON et al. 2003). This paper uses modelled water-balance scenarios of two nature reserves in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the alder-carr "Erlenbruch Lichteler Landturm" and the fen "Birkenweiher" to examine how climate changes may affect the water balance, the site characteristics, and the vegetation.

AB Boreal wetlands cover approximately 30 % of the West Siberian Plain (WSP). The Great Vasyugan Mire, Northern Hemisphere's largest contiguous wetlands, occupies low-lying plains in the Ob and Irtysh's interfluve. Most research has investigated the peat generating processes and reserves in the WSP wetlands. Little information exists about temporal changes in the chemical composition of the wetland waters within the Ob-Irtysh interfluve. Although the region's climate is continental with extended cold winters and short hot summers, Western Siberia is experiencing rapid climatic changes. The consequences of these changes include permafrost loss, snow cover reduction, and river flow changes. In this study whether and how increasing surface air temperatures contributed to changes in the chemical composition of the atmospheric precipitation and water in the mire were investigated. Time-series analysis and multivariate statistics on the hydrochemical data collected between 1994 and 2013 at several sampling sites were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the possible correlations between the increasing surface air temperatures and various chemical constituents in the precipitation and the wetland water.

AB Because climate change can affect the carbon balance and hydrology in permafrost peatlands, a better understanding of their sensitivity to changes in temperature and precipitation is needed. In Tavvavuoma, northernmost Sweden, meteorological parameters and ground thermal properties have been monitored in a peat plateau from 2006 to 2013. During this time period, the air temperature record shows no warming trend, and the late-season thaw depth has been relatively stable at around 55-60cm. Meanwhile, the mean annual ground temperature at 1m depth has increased by 0.06 degrees C/yr and at 2-5m depth the permafrost is currently warmer than -0.3 degrees C. Statistical analyses suggest that interannual changes in thaw depth and ground temperatures are affected by different meteorological factors. Summer air temperatures and annual thawing degree-days control thaw depth (p0.05), whereas winter precipitation/snow depth affects ground temperatures (p0.1). The permafrost in this peat plateau is likely relict and not in equilibrium with current climatic conditions. Since the early 20(th) century, there has been a regional increase in air temperature and snow depth. If the ongoing permafrost warming in Tavvavuoma is a result of these long-term trends, short-term variability in meteorological parameters can still have an impact on the rate of permafrost degradation, but unless pronounced climate cooling occurs, thawing of the peat plateau is inevitable.

AB Proxy-based reconstructions of climate variability over the last millennium provide important insights for understanding current climate change within a long-term context. Past hydrological changes are particularly difficult to reconstruct, yet rainfall patterns and variability are among the most critical environmental variables. Ombrotrophic bogs, entirely dependent on water from precipitation and sensitive to changes in the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration, are highly suitable for such hydro-climate reconstructions. We present a multi-proxy analysis (testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, stable carbon isotopes in Sphagnum, pollen, spores and macroscopic charcoal) from an ombrotrophic peat profile from the Rodna Mountains (northern Romania) to establish a quantitative record of hydro-climatic changes. We identify five main stages: wet surface mire conditions between AD 800 and 1150 and AD 1800 and 1950, and drying of the mire surface between AD 1300 and 1450, AD 1550 and 1750 and AD 1950 and 2012. Our multi-proxy reconstructions suggest that conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) period (AD 900-1150) were considerably wetter than today, while during most of the Little Ice Age' (LIA; AD 1500-1850), they were dry. Mire surface conditions in the Rodna Mountains have dried markedly over the last 40years mainly as a result of anthropogenic climate change approaching the driest conditions seen over the last 1000years. There is a marked difference between current hydro-climatic conditions (dry mire) and those of the MCA (wet mire). This implies that for the study region, the MCA cannot provide analogous climatic conditions to the contemporary situation. Our reconstructions are in partial agreement with water table estimates elsewhere in central and eastern Europe but generally contrast with those from NW Europe, especially during LIA. We suggest that these distinctive regional differences result from fluctuations in large-scale atmospheric circulation, which determine the relative influences of continental and oceanic air masses.

AB A large portion of the global carbon pool is stored in peatlands, which are sensitive to a changing environment conditions. The hydrological loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is believed to play a key role in determining the carbon balance in peatlands. Zoige peatland, the largest peat store in China, is experiencing climatic warming and drying as well as experiencing severe artificial drainage. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we experimentally manipulated temperature and controlled the water tables in large mesocosms containing intact peat monoliths. Specifically, we determined the impact of warming and water table position on the hydrological loss of DOC, the exported amounts, concentrations and qualities of DOC, and the discharge volume in Zoige peatland. Our results revealed that of the water table position had a greater impact on DOC export than the warming treatment, which showed no interactive effects with the water table treatment. Both DOC concentration and discharge volume were significantly increased when water table drawdown, while only the DOC concentration was significantly promoted by warming treatment. Annual DOC export was increased by 69% and 102% when the water table, controlled at 0 cm, was experimentally lowered by -10 cm and -20 cm. Increases in colored and aromatic constituents of DOC (measured by Abs(254 nm), SUVA(254 nm), Abs(400 nm), and SUVA(400 nm)) were observed under the lower water tables and at the higher peat temperature. Our results provide an indication of the potential impacts of climatic change and anthropogenic drainage on the carbon cycle and/or water storage in a peatland and simultaneously imply the likelihood of potential damage to downstream ecosystems. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for local protection and sustainable development, as well as suggest that more research is required to better understand the impacts of climatic change and artificial disturbances on peatland degradation.

AB A ca. 1400-yr record from a raised bog in Isla Grande, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, registers climate fluctuations, including a Medieval Warm Period, although evidence for the 'Little Ice Age' is less clear. Changes in temperature and/or precipitation were inferred from plant macrofossils, pollen, fungal spores, testate amebae, and peat humification. The chronology was established using a C-14 wiggle-matching technique that provides improved age control for at least part of the record compared to other sites. These new data are presented and compared with other lines of evidence from the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. A period of low local water tables occurred in the bog between A.D. 960-1020, which may correspond to the Medieval Warm Period date range of A.D. 950-1045 generated from Northern Hemisphere tree-ring data. A period of cooler and/or wetter conditions was detected between ca. A.D. 1030 and I 100 and a later period of cooler/wetter conditions estimated at ca. cal A.D. 1800-1930, which may correspond to a cooling episode inferred from Law Dome, Antarctica.

AB Currently, little is known about the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range of California or other mountainous regions of the world. The purpose of this study was to determine whether small alpine peatlands called fens can be used as whole-ecosystem gauges of groundwater recharge through time. Fens are sustained by groundwater discharge and are highly sensitive to changes in groundwater flow due to hydrologic disturbance including climate change. Seven fens in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range were studied over a 50-80 year period using historic aerial photography. In each aerial photograph, fen areas were identified as open lawn and partially treed areas that exhibited (1) dark brownish-green coloring or various shades of gray and black in black and white imagery and (2) mottling of colors and clustering of vegetation, which signified a distinct moss canopy with overlying clumped sedge vegetation. In addition to the aerial photography study, a climate analysis for the study sites was carried out using both measured data (U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service SNOwpack TELemetry system) and modeled data (a downscaled version of the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) for the period from 1951 to 2010. Over the study period, the five fens in the Sierra Nevada were found to be decreasing between 10% and 16% in delineated area. The climate analysis revealed significant increases through time in annual mean minimum temperature (T-min) between 1951-1980 and 1981-2010. In addition, April 1 snow water equivalent and snowpack longevity also decreased between 1951-1980 and 1981-2010. For the fens in the Cascade Range, there were no discernible changes in delineated area. At these sites, increases in T-min occurred only within the past 20-25 years and decreases in snowpack longevity were more subtle. A conceptual model is presented, which illustrates that basic differences in hydrogeology of the Sierra Nevada vs. the Cascade Range may control the threshold at which changes in delineated fen areas are discernible. Overall, the results from this study show that fens in the Sierra Nevada have strong potential as whole-ecosystem gauges for determining long-term changes in groundwater recharge under climate change. Due to either more moderate climate change and/or hydrogeological differences, fens in the southern Cascade Range currently do not appear to have the same utility. A greater sample size of fens in the Sierra Nevada is needed to confirm the general applicability of this method. In addition, future work needs to focus on integrating fen monitoring with geochemical and/or isotopic process-level studies in order to quantify changes in groundwater recharge identified using this new approach.

AB Reflooding formerly drained peatlands has been proposed as a means to reduce losses of organic matter and sequester soil carbon for climate change mitigation, but a renewal of high methane emissions has been reported for these ecosystems, offsetting mitigation potential. Our ability to interpret observed methane fluxes in reflooded peatlands and make predictions about future flux trends is limited due to a lack of detailed studies of methanogenic processes. In this study we investigate methanogenesis in a reflooded agricultural peatland in the Sacramento Delta, California. We use the stable-and radio-carbon isotopic signatures of wetland sediment methane, ecosystem-scale eddy covariance flux observations, and laboratory incubation experiments, to identify which carbon sources and methanogenic production pathways fuel methanogenesis and how these processes are affected by vegetation and seasonality. We found that the old peat contribution to annual methane emissions was large (~30%) compared to intact wetlands, indicating a biogeochemical legacy of drainage. However, fresh carbon and the acetoclastic pathway still accounted for the majority of methanogenesis throughout the year. Although temperature sensitivities for bulk peat methanogenesis were similar between open-water (Q(10) = 2.1) and vegetated (Q(10) = 2.3) soils, methane production from both fresh and old carbon sources showed pronounced seasonality in vegetated zones. We conclude that high methane emissions in restored wetlands constitute a biogeochemical trade-off with contemporary carbon uptake, given that methane efflux is fueled primarily by fresh carbon inputs.

AB A large proportion of northern peatlands consists of Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bogs. In these bogs, peat mosses (Sphagnum) and vascular plants occur in an apparent stable equilibrium, thereby sustaining the carbon sink function of the bog ecosystem. How global warming and increased nitrogen (N) deposition will affect the species composition in bog vegetation is still unclear. We performed a transplantation experiment in which mesocosms with intact vegetation were transplanted southward from north Sweden to north-east Germany along a transect of four bog sites, in which both temperature and N deposition increased. In addition, we monitored undisturbed vegetation in control plots at the four sites of the latitudinal gradient. Four growing seasons after transplantation, ericaceous dwarf shrubs had become much more abundant when transplanted to the warmest site which also had highest N deposition. As a result ericoid aboveground biomass in the transplanted mesocosms increased most at the southernmost site, this site also had highest ericoid biomass in the undisturbed vegetation. The two dominant Sphagnum species showed opposing responses when transplanted southward; Sphagnum balticum height increment decreased, whereas S. fuscum height increment increased when transplanted southward. Sphagnum production did not differ significantly among the transplanted mesocosms, but was lowest in the southernmost control plots. The dwarf shrub expansion and increased N concentrations in plant tissues we observed, point in the direction of a positive feedback toward vascular plant-dominance suppressing peat-forming Sphagnum in the long term. However, our data also indicate that precipitation and phosphorus availability influence the competitive balance between Sphagnum, dwarf shrubs and graminoids.

AB Under the warmer climate, predicted for the future, northern peatlands are expected to become drier. This drying will lower the water table and likely result in reduced emissions of methane (CH4) from these ecosystems. However, the prediction of declining CH4 fluxes does not consider the potential effects of ecological succession, particularly the invasion of sedges into currently wet sites (open water pools, low lawns). The goal of this study was to characterize the relationship between the presence of sedges in peatlands and CH4 efflux under natural conditions and under a climate change simulation (drained peatland). Methane fluxes, gross ecosystem production, and dissolved pore water CH4 concentrations were measured and a vegetation survey was conducted in a natural and drained peatland near St. Charles-de-Bellechasse, Quebec, Canada, in the summer of 2003. Each peatland also had plots where the sedges had been removed by clipping. Sedges were larger, more dominant, and more productive at the drained peatland site. The natural peatland had higher CH4 fluxes than the drained peatland, indicating that drainage was a significant control on CH4 flux. Methane flux was higher from plots with sedges than from plots where sedges had been removed at the natural peatland site, whereas the opposite case was observed at the drained peatland site. These results suggest that CH4 flux was enhanced by sedges at the natural peatland site and attenuated by sedges at the drained peatland site. However, the attenuation of CH4 flux due to sedges at the drained site was reduced in wetter periods. This finding suggests that CH4 flux could be decreased in the event of climate warming due to the greater depth to the water table, and that sedges colonizing these areas could further attenuate CH4 fluxes during dry periods. However, during wet periods, the sedges may cause CH4 fluxes to be higher than is currently predicted for climate change scenarios.

AB Peatland soils store substantial amounts of organic matter (OM). During peat formation, easily decomposable OM is preferentially lost and more recalcitrant moieties accumulate. In a peat profile, OM quality thus scales with depth. Drainage and ongoing climate change poses the risk of rapid OM loss when formerly anoxic peat layers oxidize. During peat decomposition, deeper, more recalcitrant peat is exposed to the oxygen-rich surface, which may influence the decomposition rate. We show that the soil respiration rate of a disturbed temperate peatland is strongly controlled by the peat's quality and especially its polysaccharides content. The polysaccharide content of soil profiles in a wider range of peatland sites with differing degrees of disturbance was inferred by means of solid-state C-13 NMR and DRIFT spectroscopy. The data confirmed a strong decline in polysaccharide content with depth and a poor OM quality of surface peat in soils drained decades ago. We combined the evidence from respiration and spectroscopic measurements to deduce the sensitivity of peatland carbon loss with respect to OM quality by scaling measured quality to a 142-years record of peatland subsidence and carbon loss at one of the sites. According to the functional relationship between quality and respiration, the measured average annual carbon loss rate of 2.5 t C ha(-1) at that site was 20 t C ha(-1) at the onset of peatland drainage and dropped to less than 1 t C ha(-1) in recent times.

AB Peatlands play outsized roles in the global carbon cycle. Despite occupying a rather small fraction of the terrestrial biosphere (similar to 3%), these ecosystems account for roughly one third of the global soil carbon pool. This carbon is largely comprised of undecomposed deposits of plant material (peat) that may be meters thick. The fate of this deep carbon stockpile with ongoing and future climate change is thus of great interest and has large potential to induce positive feedback to climate warming. Recent in situ warming of an ombrotrophic peatland indicated that the deep peat microbial communities and decomposition rates were resistant to elevated temperatures. In this experiment, we sought to understand how nutrient and pH limitations may interact with temperature to limit microbial activity and community composition. Anaerobic microcosms of peat collected from 1.5 to 2 meters in depth were incubated at 6 degrees C and 15 degrees C with elevated pH, nitrogen (NH4Cl), and/or phosphorus (KH2PO4) in a full factorial design. The production of CO2 and CH4 was significantly greater in microcosms incubated at 15 degrees C, although the structure of the microbial community did not differ between the two temperatures. Increasing the pH from similar to 3.5 to similar to 5.5 altered microbial community structure, however increases in CH4 production were non-significant. Contrary to expectations, N and P additions did not increase CO2 and CH4 production, indicating that nutrient availability was not a primary constraint in microbial decomposition of deep peat. Our findings indicate that temperature is a key factor limiting the decomposition of deep peat, however other factors such as the availability of O-2 or alternative electron donors and high concentrations of phenolic compounds, may also exert constraints. Continued experimental peat warming studies will be necessary to assess if the deep peat carbon bank is susceptible to increased temperatures over the longer time scales.

AB Water purification is one of the most essential services provided by wetlands. A lot of concerns regarding wetlands subjected to climate change relate to their susceptibility to hydrological change and the increase in temperature as a result of global warming. A warmer condition may accelerate the rate of decomposition and release of nutrients, which can be exported downstream and cause serious ecological challenges; e.g., eutrophication and acidification. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of climate change on water quality in peatland and constructed wetland ecosystems subject to water level management. For this purpose, the authors simulated the current climate scenario base on the database from Malmo? station (Scania, Sweden) for 2016 and 2017 as well as the future climate scenarios for the last 30 years of the century based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and different regional climate models (RCM) for a region wider than Scania County. For future climate change, the authors simulated low (RCP 2.6), moderate (RCP 4.5) and extreme (RCP 8.5) climate scenarios. All simulations were conducted within climate chambers for experimental peatland and constructed wetland mesocosms. Our results demonstrate that the effect of climate scenario is significantly different for peatlands and constructed wetlands (interactive effect) for the combined chemical variables. The warmest climate scenario RCP 8.5 is linked to a higher water purification function for constructed wetlands, but to a lower water purification function and a subsequent deterioration of peatland water qualities, even if subjected to water level management. The explanation for the different response of constructed wetlands and peatlands to climate change could be due to the fact that the substrate in the constructed wetland mesocosms and peatlands was different in terms of the organic matter quality and quantity. The utilization of nutrients by the plants and microbial community readily exceed the mineralization under a limited nutrient content (as we had in constructed wetland) when the temperature rises. However, concerning the extreme scenario RCP 8.5, the peatlands have shown a tendency to have reverse processes.

AB Boreal peatlands, which contain a large fraction of the world's soil organic carbon pool, may be significantly affected by changes in climate and land use, with attendant feedback to climate through changes in albedo, fluxes of energy or trace gases, and soil carbon storage. The response of peatlands to changing environmental conditions will probably be dictated in part by scale-dependent topographic heterogeneity, which is known to interact with hydrology, vegetation, nutrients, and emissions of trace gases. Because the bryophyte community can contribute the majority of aboveground production in bogs, we investigated how microscale topography affects the response of bryophyte species production and cover to warming (using overhead infrared lamps) and manipulations of water-table height within experimental mesocosms. We removed 27 intact peat monoliths (2.1-m(2) surface area, 0.5-0.7 in depth) from a bog in northern Minnesota, USA, and subjected them to three warming and three water-table treatments in a fully crossed factorial design. Between 1994 and 1998, we determined annual production of the four dominant bryophyte taxa within three microtopographic zones (low, medium, and high relative to the water table). We also estimated species cover and calculated changes in topography and roughness of the bryophyte surface through time. Total production of all bryophytes, and production of the individual taxa Polytrichum strictum, Sphagnum magellanicum, and Sphagnum Section Acutifolia, were about 100% greater in low microtopographic zones than in high zones, and about 50% greater in low than in medium zones. Production of bryophytes increased along the gradient of increasing water-table heights, but in most years, total production of bryophytes was negatively correlated with height above the set water table only for the wettest water-table treatment. Although bryophyte production was unaffected by the warming treatments, the bryophyte surface flattened in proportion to the degree of warming. These results indicate that production of bryophytes is driven most strongly by the absolute and relative height of the bryophyte surface above the water table. Predicted changes in water-table height commensurate with changes in surface temperature may thus affect both production and superficial topography of bryophyte communities.

AB Organic carbon solution and transport processes which occur during periods of heavy rainfall and periods or little or no rainfall, can exert a significant control over a systems' annual organic carbon budget. In addition, either or both extremes can be key contributors to contaminant release, water discolouration, flood risk or vegetation growth. Although there is an increasing body of work studying hydrological responses to peatland restoration, there are very little available data on the performance of restored peatlands during these key periods. This study builds on previous work from an upland peatland in Wales that has been restored through drain-blocking, and presents evidence from a landscape scale experimental study at the site. A comparison of sampling scales within the study demonstrates the necessity of larger spatial scales, in combination with high resolution datasets, in assessing catchment level responses. Our results suggest that drain blocking leads to higher and more stable water tables that are able to better resist drought periods, and thus lead to more stable discharge from the system. The shallower water tables and pooling in drains also appear to reduce the production and transport of fluvial organic carbon, and thus less organic material is available to be released as during peak flow or dry periods. Despite restoration apparently reducing the available water storage within the peat, the increase in overland flow and in pooling within blocked drains appears to have led to a less flashy system. Peak flow responses in both drains and upland streams are less severe, with more rainfall being retained within the bog. We suggest that restoration leads to a more buffered system, with more moderate responses to extreme events, and reduced release of both dissolved and particulate organic carbon. We discuss the implications of this for fluxes of fluvial organic carbon and sediment loss. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon release due to permafrost thaw represents a potentially major positive climate change feedback. The magnitude of carbon loss and the proportion lost as methane (CH4) vs. carbon dioxide (CO2) depend on factors including temperature, mobilization of previously frozen carbon, hydrology, and changes in organic matter chemistry associated with environmental responses to thaw. While the first three of these effects are relatively well understood, the effect of organic matter chemistry remains largely un-studied. To address this gap, we examined the biogeochemistry of peat and dissolved organic matter (DOM) along a similar to 40-y permafrost thaw progression from recently- to fully thawed sites in Stordalen Mire (68.35 degrees N, 19.05 degrees E), a thawing peat plateau in northern Sweden. Thaw-induced subsidence and the resulting inundation along this progression led to succession in vegetation types accompanied by an evolution in organic matter chemistry. Peat C/N ratios decreased whereas humification rates increased, and DOM shifted toward lower molecular weight compounds with lower aromaticity, lower organic oxygen content, and more abundant microbially produced compounds. Corresponding changes in decomposition along this gradient included increasing CH4 and CO2 production potentials, higher relative CH4/CO2 ratios, and a shift in CH4 production pathway from CO2 reduction to acetate cleavage. These results imply that subsidence and thermokarst-associated increases in organic matter lability cause shifts in biogeochemical processes toward faster decomposition with an increasing proportion of carbon released as CH4. This impact of permafrost thaw on organic matter chemistry could intensify the predicted climate feedbacks of increasing temperatures, permafrost carbon mobilization, and hydrologic changes.

AB Comprehensive and credible peatland carbon budgets, needed for global carbon accounting, must include lateral aquatic organic carbon export. Here, we quantify aquatic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export for an Atlantic bog in subarctic Norway, the Andoya peatland, and test for sensitivity to climatic drivers. Hydrology, DOC concentrations and DOC export were simulated for 2000-2013 using the process-based catchment model Integrated Catchments model for Carbon (INCA-C), calibrated to site-specific water chemistry and hydrology (2011-2014) using readily-available data on temperature, precipitation and seasalt deposition. Measured streamwater DOC declined under seasalt episodes and was strongly positively related to temperature. Model calibrations successfully reproduced the water balance, variation in runoff (R-2 = 0.67; Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency NS = 0.67) and DOC concentrations (R-2 = 0.85; NS = 0.84). The most sensitive model parameters related to temperature-sensitivity of DOC production and DOC (de)sorption sensitivity to seasalts. Model uncertainty related to parameter space was similar to interannual variation in DOC export. Mean annual modelled DOC export was 7.2 +/- A 0.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), roughly 35 % of the net land-atmospheric CO2 exchange at Andoya from 2009 to 2012 (estimated elsewhere). Current and antecedent mean temperature and precipitation were strong drivers of seasonal modelled DOC export, implying that warmer and wetter summers will lead to more DOC export. Evaluation of similar climate impacts on net peatland carbon accumulation requires additional exploration of the climate-sensitivity of land-atmosphere fluxes of CO2 and methane. Process-based models are valuable tools to account for lateral DOC exports in carbon balances of northern peatlands, especially where long-term monitoring data are lacking.

AB 1 British and world distribution patterns of the moss Racomitrium lanuginosum (Hedw.) Brid. are used to deduce the likely conditions governing the occurrence of its preserved leaves in the upper layers of British blanket peats. It is suggested that R. lanuginosum dominates in blanket mires only under conditions of lowered water table and high atmospheric humidity.
   2 Detailed stratigraphic records from blanket mires in the Southern Pennines (Northern England) and the Berwyn Mountains (North Wales) show remains of R. lanuginosum preserved in the peat columns of both eroded and uneroded sites. At uneroded sites in the Southern Pennines, Racomitrium remains predominate between about AD 1250 and 1450 and again in the mid-Eighteenth Century. At hummock sites in both regions, and at gullied sites in the Southern Pennines, Racomitrium remains are continuously present in the peat column from about AD 1250-1800.
   3 It is concluded that the presence of Racomitrium remains in the peat column constitutes a clear proxy-climate signal, signifying, in uneroded areas, a prolonged period of drier climate succeeded by a return to a wetter, more humid climate (though that signal may be blurred by superimposed effects of burning and grazing of the mire surface).
   4 The macrofossil record demonstrates the marked effects on the blanket mire vegetation of both study regions of the documented period of drier climate from c. AD 1115-1300 (the 'Early Mediaeval Warm Period').
   5 Possible consequences of that episode on the blanket mires of the two regions include the onset of gully erosion and the development of a 'stagnation complex' in pool-and-hummock systems. The extension of these findings to other blanket mire regions of the British Isles is discussed.

AB Export of dissolved organic carbon from lakes and streams has increased throughout Europe and North America over the past several decades. One possible cause is altered deposition chemistry; specifically, decreasing sulfate inputs leading to changes in ionic strength and dissolved organic carbon solubility. To further investigate the relationship between deposition chemistry and dissolved organic carbon export in peatlands, a field experiment was conducted to compare the pore water chemistry and peat microbial enzyme activity of mesocosms receiving sulfate amendments to mesocosms receiving no additions. To consider how peatlands respond during recovery from increased inputs of sulfate, samples were also analyzed from an area of the same peatland that was previously amended with sulfate. Current additions of sulfate decreased dissolved organic carbon concentration and increased dissolved organic carbon aromaticity. Total dissolved phosphorus decreased in response to current sulfate amendments but was elevated in the area of the peatland recovering from sulfate amendment. The total dissolved phosphorus increase, which was reflected in microbial enzyme activity, may have shifted the system from P limitation to N limitation. This shift could have important consequences for ecosystem processes related to plant and microbial communities. It also suggests that the recovery from previous sulfate amendments may take longer than may be expected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the sources and removal mechanisms for dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is critical to determining the importance of peatlands in influencing streamwater DOM concentrations. Soil saturation and soil temperature are the primary factors that influence DOM cycling in soils, but the relationships among these factors vary by soil type and climate. Despite the extent of peatlands that occur within Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) watersheds, there is little information describing how DOM storage and export patterns are related to soil saturation and temperature in the region. We measured soil water tables, soil temperatures and redox potential and compared these measurements to fluctuations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations in a forested wetland and sloping bog in southeast Alaska to address this key information gap. DOC concentrations ranged from 5 to 140 mg C l(-1) in wetland soils, 11 to 46 mg C l(-1) in streams, and varied greatly in response to changes in water table, redox potential and soil temperature. Similarly, DON concentrations ranged from 0.03 to 2.4 mg N l(-1) in wetland soils, 0.2 to 0.6 mg N l(-1) in streams and concentrations also reflected seasonal changes in physical measures. Depth to water table and soil temperature were significant factors related to the concentration of DOC in forested wetland soils and streams, while soil temperature was a significant factor that influenced stream DOC and DON concentrations. Comparing soil solution and stream DOM concentrations indicated that N is retained in bogs, while both dilution and biotic/abiotic retention mechanisms control DOM export in forested wetlands. The relationships among soil saturation, temperature and concentrations of DOC and DON provide preliminary models for estimating DOM fluxes from wetland soils in the CTR. Furthermore, these results can help calibrate regional watershed carbon flux models to predict the potential impacts of climate shifts and management activities on future wetland soil and stream DOM concentrations in CTR watersheds.

AB Water discolouration is a major management problem for UK water companies as a proportion of the supply relies on runoff from peat-covered catchments. Many peats have been drained using surface ditches but this has been shown to lead to more severe water discolouration. Drain-blocking is now actively encouraged in UK peatlands to promote peatland habitats and water companies are considering funding drain-btocking if water colour benefits can be demonstrated. However, there is concern that rewetting of the peat may lead to a sudden flush of water colour from the peat causing problems for water treatment works downstream. This study tested different drain-blocking techniques in an upland peat catchment and evaluated the impact of drain-blocking on water colour production immediately after drain-blocking. The study started sampling prior to the blocking of the drains and continued for 10 months afterwards. It was shown that drain-blocking significantly increased water tables in the vicinity of the drains. Drain-blocking approximately doubled water colour within blocked drains, a difference that was sustained across the entire study period. Whenever runoff occurred from a blocked drain it was always more discoloured than prior to blocking. However, during the 10 months following drain-blocking no catchment scale change in river water colour could be determined. No drain-blocking technique was demonstrably better or worse than any other with respect to water colour and percentage of time for which there was flow in the drain. Therefore, if more drain-btocking is undertaken then the most economical methods, using peat turves, should be adopted. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In contrast to several organisms that have already shown range shifts to the north as a response to climate change, southern populations of relict species are trapped in isolated altitudinal habitats. Therefore, there is a growing interest to better understand their habitat use, with particular attention to the thermal aspects and associated significance for their habitat management. We address this issue by a study of larval habitat use relative to vegetation structure and microclimate in a glacial relict butterfly of peat bog ecosystems, using a functional, resource-based habitat approach. We analysed caterpillar presence and density relative to vegetation composition (reflecting gradients of humidity, temperature, and natural succession of the peat bog) and to the availability and quality of thermal refuges for caterpillars (i.e., structures provided by Sphagnum hummocks). We also tested caterpillar survival rates under different temperature and humidity treatments. We found that (1) Boloria aquilonaris was a specialist butterfly of early successional stages with very humid zones of peat bog, (2) the lack of Sphagnum hummocks reduced larval habitat suitability, and hence the population density, and (3) a reduction of the thermal buffering ability of Sphagnum hummocks was observed in less humid, degraded parts, or late-successional stages of peat bog. A larval rearing experiment showed a significant impact of temperature on caterpillar survival; survival being higher at lower temperature. Our field and laboratory results support the idea that the thermal environment exploited by caterpillars should be considered as a functional resource and included in a population-specific habitat definition. Appropriate management of the peat bog habitat of this glacial relict species should not exclusively focus on the larval and adult feeding resources, but also on the quality of thermal refuges provided by Sphagnum hummocks in humid zones of the peat bog, especially in the current critical context of climate warming.

AB Wetlands play an important role in preventing extreme low flows in rivers and groundwater level drawdowns during drought periods. This hydrological function could become increasingly important under a warmer climate. Links between peatlands, aquifers, and rivers remain inadequately understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the hydrologic functions of the Lanoraie peatland complex in southern Quebec, Canada, under different climate conditions. This peatland complex has developed in the beds of former fluvial channels during the final stages of the last deglaciation. The peatland covers a surface area of similar to 76 km(2) and feeds five rivers. Numerical simulations were performed using a steady-state groundwater flow model. Results show that the peatland contributes on average to 77% of the mean annual river base flow. The peatland receives 52% of its water from the aquifer. Reduced recharge scenarios (-20 and -50% of current conditions) were used as a surrogate of climate change. With these scenarios, the simulated mean head decreases by 0.6 and 1.6 m in the sand. The mean river base flow decreases by 16 and 41% with the two scenarios. These results strongly underline the importance of aquifer-peatland-river interactions at the regional scale. They also point to the necessity of considering the entire hydrosystem in conservation initiatives.

AB Misten Bog has through time received homogeneous pollen rain dominated successively by Fagus, Quercus and Picea. Based on the limits separating six pollen zones across nine cores, we show that the areas of major peat production have moved with time from one side of the bog to the other. The reduction of thickness of peat was strongly dependant on the proximity of peat cutting area since the 12th Century. Before the cutting, an Alnus wood that encircled the bog regressed during the Vandal Minimum (500-800 AD) and never recovered. During this age interval, testate amoebae indicate a drier period on the peat bog. From the 12th to the 14th Centuries, there was a slight increase of non arboreal pollens linked to farming. From the 14th to the 16th Centuries testate amoebae indicate again a drier period on the peat bog but whether this is linked to climate change or human pressure is unclear. From the 16th Century onwards, Sphagnum sect Cuspidata almost disappeared but Sphagnum imbricatum persisted until the 19th Century. Pollens linked to farming culminated again during the early part of the 19th Century. High concentration of Si, Ti and N are probably linked to the increasing fanning in the neighborhood as well as to industrial mining processes in the region and might have influenced these changes on the peat bog. The theory of cyclical hollow/hummock succession versus rather stationary hummocks is discussed.

AB High-latitude warming could cause northern peatlands to become C sources. Where peattands border boreal forests, strong differences in ecosystem C balances reflect drainage differences. Because local drainage conditions could be influenced by alterations in temperature and precipitation regimes, peatland-forest ecotones represent useful locations for monitoring potential impacts of global warming. We characterized the soils, hydrology, and forest structure along transects bracketing a peatland-forest ecotone in southeastern Alaska. We expected to find soil properties and processes at the peatland-forest edge that were intermediate between those from peatland and forest. Instead, we found that above- and belowground features of the ecotone did not coincide. Conifers grew on mineral soils, but also grew on Cryofibrists and Cryohemists, soils with high soil organic C (SOC) contents to 100 cm (57 kg m(-2)) that are significantly greater than the SOC contents of adjacent forested, non-Histosol pedons. Soil ;respiration rates (SRR) at peatland-forest edges (0.08 g CO2-C m(-2) h(-1)), by contrast, were threefold lower than forest rates and did not differ significantly from peatland rates. Respiration rates were strongly influenced by water table height. Peattand and edge water tables were both significantly shallower than forest water tables. Our conceptual model suggests that if additional forest expansion and warmer summers enhance drainage of these edge soils and stimulate SRR to forest-like levels, 23 kg C m(-2) could ultimately be mineralized from these extensive peatland-forest boundaries. Afforestation of peattand margins under this scenario could represent a transient positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO2 levels.

AB Wildfire is the largest disturbance affecting boreal peatlands, however, little is known about the controls on post-fire peatland vegetation recovery. While small-scale variation in burn severity can reduce post-fire moss water availability, high water table (WT) positions following wildfire are also critical to enable the re-establishment of keystone peatland mosses (i.e. Sphagnum). Thus, post-fire moss water availability is also likely a function of landscape-scale controls on peatland WT dynamics, specifically, connectivity to groundwater flow systems (i.e. hydrogeological setting). For this reason, we assessed the interacting controls of hydrogeological setting and burn severity on post-fire moss water availability in three burned, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in Alberta's Boreal Plains. At all sites, variation in burn severity resulted in a dichotomy between post-fire surface covers that: (1) exhibited low water availability, regardless of WT position, and had minimal (<5%) moss re-establishment (i.e. lightly burned feather mosses and severely burned Sphagnum fuscum) or (2) exhibited high water availability, depending on WT position, and had substantial (>50%) moss re-establishment (i.e. lightly burned S. fuscum and where depth of burn was >0.05 m). Notably, hydrogeological setting influenced the spatial coverage of these post-fire surface covers by influencing pre-fire WTs and stand characteristics (e.g., shading). Because feather moss cover is controlled by tree shading, lightly burned feather mosses were ubiquitous (>25%) in drier peatlands (deeper pre-fire WTs) that were densely treed and had little connection to large groundwater flow systems. Moreover, hydrogeological setting also controlled post-fire WT positions, thereby affecting moss re-establishment in post-fire surface covers that were dependent on WT position (e.g., lightly burned S.fuscum). Accordingly, higher recolonization rates were observed in a peatland located in a groundwater flow through system that had a shallow post-fire WT. Therefore, we argue that hydrogeological setting influences post-fire recovery in two ways: (1) by influencing vegetation structure prior to wildfire, thereby controlling the coverage of post-fire surface covers and (2) by influencing post-fire WT positions. These results suggest that post-fire moss recovery in peatlands isolated from groundwater flow systems may be particularly susceptible to droughts and future climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Climate projections forecast a redistribution of seasonal precipitation for much of the globe into fewer, larger events spaced between longer dry periods, with negligible changes in seasonal rainfall totals. This intensification of the rainfall regime is expected to alter near-surface water availability, which will affect plant performance and carbon uptake. This could be especially important in peatland systems, where large stores of carbon are tightly coupled to water surpluses limiting decomposition. Here, we examined the role of precipitation frequency on vegetation growth and carbon dioxide (CO2) balances for communities dominated by a Sphagnum moss, a sedge, and an ericaceous shrub in a cool temperate poor fen. Field plots and laboratory monoliths received one of three rainfall frequency treatments, ranging from one event every three days to one event every 14 days, while total rain delivered in a two-week cycle and the entire season to each treatment remained the same. Separating incident rain into fewer but larger events increased vascular cover in all peatland communities: vascular plant cover increased 6x in the moss-dominated plots, nearly doubled in the sedge plots, and tripled in the shrub plots in Low-Frequency relative to High-Frequency treatments. Gross ecosystem productivity was lowest in moss communities receiving low-frequency rain, but higher in sedge and shrub communities under the same conditions. Net ecosystem exchange followed this pattern: fewer events with longer dry periods increased CO2 flux to the atmosphere from the moss while vascular plant-dominated communities became more of a sink for CO2. Results of this study suggest that changes to rainfall frequency already occurring and predicted to continue will lead to increased vascular plant cover in peatlands and will impact their carbon-sink function.

AB Peatlands have been recognised as having a significant role in the mediation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels with direct implications for global climate change. Longitudinal in situ measurement systems for CO(2)concentrations in blanket peatland ecosystems are difficult to implement where the nature of terrestrial-aquatic connectivity and hydrodynamics have a significant effect on the carbon cycle. The need for greater data on CO2 concentrations and flux monitoring in these settings has been well recognised. However, applying the most appropriate monitoring approach presents a special challenge. This paper sets out the development of a direct method for field based longitudinal CO(2)concentration measurement. Based on experiential considerations a new approach is presented that addresses the complexity associated with the high diurnal dynamics of CO2 evasion during mid-winter in an Irish blanket peatland soil-water system. The paper outlines the significance of a direct in situ continuous measurement strategy using a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor to evaluate CO2 concentrations. The CO2 concentrations recorded as part of this study showed significant differences between the pond waters and the peat waters. The overall CO2 concentration trend did not correlate with the temperature patterns. Further monitoring is essential to evaluate the spatial and longitudinal trends in carbon dynamics. Outputs of this study will have a direct bearing on approaches to carbon flux determinations for this landscape type and will provide an important input to future efforts to explore carbon-hydrodynamics in the surface and subsurface waters of blanket peatlands.

AB Peatlands store one-third of the total global soil carbon (C.) despite covering only 3-4% of the global land surface. Most peatlands are distributed in mid-high latitude regions and are even in permafrost regions, are sensitive to climate change and are disturbed by wildfire. Although several studies have focused on the impact of historical climate change and regional human activities on the C. accumulation process in these peatlands, the impact of these factors on the stability of the C. pool remains poorly understood. Here, based on the Pb-210 age-depth model, we investigated the historical variations of C stability during the last 150 years for five typical peatlands in the northern Great Khingan Mountains (Northeast China), an area located in a permafrost region that is sensitive to climate change and to wildfires, which have clearly increased clue to regional human activities. The results showed that low C. accumulation rates (CARs) and weakly C. stability in studied peatlands before 1900. While, the increasing anthropogenic wildfire frequency and the residual products (e.g. pyrogenic carbon) increased the CARs and C. stability in peatlands from 1900 to 1980. The mean July temperature is the most important climate factor for peatlands C. stability. After 1980, due to the low wildfire frequencies influenced by human policies, increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation not only increased the CARs but also markedly increased the C. stability of the peatlands C. pool in the northern Great Khingan Mountains, especially after 2000.

AB Boreal forests are adapted to cold climates and are thus especially sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. In this study, we chose 10 plots covering different topographies at the southern edge of a boreal forest. The annual ring widths of the 249 Dahurican larch (Larix gmelinii) tree cores from these plots were measured and used to calculate the basal area increment (BAI) and the interannual sensitivity (Sx). We found that forests in 10 plots showed a significant change in Sx consistently around 1980. The growth of slope forest was significantly correlated with increases in temperature and precipitation, while the wetland forests, including bogs and peatland plateaus, responded negatively to temperature. In terms of precipitation, there was no effect in the peatland plateaus, but a negative effect occurred in bogs. Our results imply that the depth of the frost table could lead to different soil waterlogging from surplus water from thawing permafrost, resulting in different responses of tree growth to climate change.

AB Permafrost thaw associated with warmer temperatures is expected to elevate nutrient levels in northern aquatic ecosystems, including peatlands. To evaluate these effects on algae and heterotrophic bacteria, we manipulated nutrients (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) and temperature (ambient and warmed) in a factorial design using nutrient diffusing substrates inside warming chambers in an Alaskan peatland. After 16 days, there was no effect of warming on the abundance of algae or heterotrophic bacteria in the absence of nutrient enrichment. Algal production and bacterial biomass were substantially elevated by N with and without P (NP and N, respectively), independent of warming. Warming significantly enhanced the effect of nutrient enrichment on the abundance of algae and heterotrophic bacteria compared with ambient temperatures. Rates of N fixation increased with the presence of heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria, which represented a greater proportion of algal taxonomic composition in the absence of N enrichment in both ambient and warmed conditions. Our results indicate that warmer temperatures and nutrient enrichment will elevate algal and heterotrophic metabolism in northern peatlands, and the magnitude of increase will depend on the combination of nutrients available during periods of inundation.

AB Understanding the influence of salt on the release and transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is crucial for developing management strategies for coastal wetlands. We hypothesize that salt causes distinct changes in certain compound classes of DOM, distinguishable from the impact of other factors such as peat origin and decomposition degree. Therefore, the DOM composition was investigated in freshwater and saltwater extracts of nine peat samples of varying origin and decomposition degree. Samples were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen concentrations and pH values, and organic matter composition by temperature-resolved pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS). The data revealed larger abundances of phenols/lignin monomers, peptides, carbohydrates, (mainly heterocyclic) N-compounds/nitriles and alkylaromatics in the saltwater extracts. The thermal release curves in Py-FIMS indicated a precipitation of fractions of alkylaromatics, N-compounds/nitriles and phenols/lignin monomers and a release of lipids, alkylaromatics and free fatty acids n-C-16 to n-C-34 in the saltwater extracts. Coagulation/precipitation, cation exchange and, for free fatty acids, the formation of micelles seem to be key mechanisms of the salt impact. Due to the stronger direct and indirect influences of saltwater on less decomposed peat an adapted management should be directed to preferentially protect rather pristine peatlands from saltwater intrusions that can be expected as a result of rising ocean levels under climate change.

AB Dutch peatlands have been subsiding due to peat decomposition, shrinkage and compression, since their reclamation in the 11th century. Currently, subsidence amounts to 1-2 cm/year. Water management in these areas is complex and costly, greenhouse gases are being emitted, and surface water quality is relatively poor. Regional and local authorities and landowners responsible for peatland management have recognized these problems. In addition, the Netherlands Royal Meteorological Institute predicts higher temperatures and drier summers, which both are expected to enhance peat decomposition. Stakeholder workshops have been organized in three case study areas in the province of Friesland to exchange knowledge on subsidence and explore future subsidence rates and the effects of land use and management changes on subsidence rates. Subsidence rates were up to 3 cm/year in deeply drained parcels and increased when we included climate change in the modeling exercises. This means that the relatively thin peat layers in this province (ca 1 m) would shrink or even disappear by the end of the century when current practices continue. Adaptation measures were explored, such as extensive dairy farming and the production of new crops in wetter conditions, but little experience has been gained on best practices. The workshops have resulted in useful exchange of ideas on possible measures and their consequences for land use and water management in the three case study areas. The province and the regional water board will use the results to develop land use and water management policies for the next decades.

AB The dynamic carbon balance of a southeastern New Hampshire wetland was constructed for the 1994 growing season using a light-dark box sampling method. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (n=414) and ecosystem respiration (n=234) measurements were made at the 1.7 ha Sphagnum spp. dominated poor fen. The NEE rates ranged from -192 to 492 mg C m(-2) h(-1) and the ecosystem respiration measurements were between -10 and -365 mg C m(-2) h(-1). The negative values represent a loss of carbon from the wetland system. NEE and respiration data were used to derive photosynthesis rates of the vegetation at the study site. A simple model, using hourly averages of photosynthetically active radiation, and air and soil temperatures to generate hourly rates of photosynthesis and respiration, was constructed to interpolate the carbon cycling rates at this fen through the entire 1994 growing season. Results of the carbon balance model suggest that the wetland lost an estimated 145 g C m(-2) for the 9 month modeling period (April through December). The 1994 climate season was warmer (+1.15 degrees C/month) and drier (-12.3 cm) than the 30 year normals for Durham, New Hampshire, the nearest meteorological station. These data suggest that if future climate change brings about warmer temperatures and lower water tables in peatland soils, positive climatic feedback leading to substantial releases of CO2 from boreal and subarctic peatlands is probable.

AB Peat plateaus are widespread at high northern latitudes and are important soil organic carbon reservoirs. A warming climate can cause either increased ground subsidence (thermokarst) resulting in lake formation or increased drainage as the permafrost thaws. A better understanding of spatiotemporal variations in these landforms in relation to climate change is important for predicting the future thawing permafrost carbon feedback. In this study, dynamics in thermokarst lake extent during the last 35-50 years has been quantified through time series analysis of aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite images (IKONOS/QuickBird) in three peat plateau complexes, spread out across the northern circumpolar region along a climatic and permafrost gradient. From the mid-1970s until the mid-2000s there has been an increase in mean annual air temperature, winter precipitation, and ground temperature in all three study areas. The two peat plateaus located in the continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, respectively, where mean annual air temperatures are below -5 degrees C and ground temperatures are -2 degrees C or colder, have experienced small changes in thermokarst lake extent. In the peat plateau located in the sporadic permafrost zone where the mean annual air temperature is around -3 degrees C, and the ground temperature is close to 0 degrees C, lake drainage and infilling with fen vegetation has been extensive and many new thermokarst lakes have formed. In a future progressively warmer and wetter climate permafrost degradation can cause significant impacts on landscape composition and greenhouse gas exchange also in areas with extensive peat plateaus, which presently still experience stable permafrost conditions.

AB To evaluate the effects of changes in water level and temperatures on performance of four Sphagnum mosses, S. magellanicum, S. rubellum, S. imbricatum and S. fuscum were grown at two water levels, -5 cm and -15 cm, and at two temperatures, 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. These species differ in their position along the microtopographical gradient and in their geographical distribution. Height increment, subcapitulum bulk density, biomass production, capitulum water content and cumulative evaporation were measured. Height increment and biomass production of S. magellanicum was lower at low water table than at high water table, whereas height increment and biomass production of S. rubellum, S. imbricatum and S. fuscum were unaffected. Height increment of S. magellanicum, S. rubellum and S. imbricatum was higher at high temperature than at low temperature. Biomass production of only S. magellanicum and S. rubellum was higher at high temperature than at low temperature, corresponding with their more southern distribution. Cumulative evaporation of S. magellanicum and S. rubellum was lower at low water table and could be explained by hampered water transport towards the capitula. We conclude that changes in water table and temperature may alter the Sphagnum composition on raised bogs, which may result in changes to important ecosystem processes. Therefore, it is important that species composition and changes therein are taken into account when evaluating global change effects on raised bog ecosystems.

AB Melting seasonal ground ice (SGI) in western Boreal Plains (WBP) peatlands can reduce the available energy at the surface by reducing potential evapotranspiration (PET). PET often exceeds annual precipitation in the WBP. Including this effect in hydrological models may be important in assessing water deficits. However, SGI melt and the timing of ice-free conditions vary spatially, which suggests PET spatial variability could be influenced by SGI. Understanding this potential linkage can help improve site scale PET in peatland hydrological models. The objectives of this paper were (a) to quantify the effect of ice thickness and melt rate on peatland PET; (b) quantify the spatial variability of SGI thickness and melt rate across spatial scales; and (c) assess how/if spatial variability in SGI thickness/melt rate affects site scale PET. Results from the sensitivity analysis indicated that SGI thickness had a bigger impact on reducing PET compared with the melt rate. Two SGI thickness values were used that were observed on site: 0.32 m, which was measured in a more treed area, and 0.18 m, which was in a more open area. The 0.32 m had an average PET reduction of 14 mm (+/- 0.7), over the month of May, compared with 9 mm (+/- 1 mm) when there was 0.18 m of SGI, which are 13.7 and 8.8% reductions, respectively. SGI thickness and melt rate, both exhibited large- and small-scale spatial variability. At the large scale, spatial patterns in SGI thickness appeared to be influenced by extensive shading from the adjacent hillslopes. Small scale, SGI thickness may be a function of tree proximity and the snowpack. Finally, net radiation, rather than SGI, appeared to be the main driver behind PET spatial variability. This work enhances our conceptual understanding of the role of SGI in WBP peatlands. Future work can use the findings to better inform peatland hydrological models, allowing for better representation of peatlands in regional-scale models.

AB Microbial activity and enzymic decomposition processes were followed during a field-based experimental lowering of the water table in a Welsh peatland. Respiration was not significantly affected by the treatment. However, the enzymes sulphatase, beta-glucosidase and phosphatase were stimulated by between 31 and 67% upon water table drawdown. A further enzyme, phenol oxidase, was not significantly affected. The observation of elevated enzyme activities without an associated increase in microbial respiratory activity suggests that drought conditions influence peatland mineralisation rates through a direct stimulation of existing enzymes, rather than through a generalised stimulation of microbial metabolism (with associated de-novo enzyme synthesis). Hydrochemical data suggest that the stimulation may have been caused by a reduction in the inhibitory action of iron and phenolics in the peat pore waters. Overall, the findings support the recent hypothesis that drier conditions associated with climate change could stimulate mineralisation within wetlands.

AB Sphagnum-dominated peatlands are major carbon pools and sinks, but these functions are threatened by climate change. There is, therefore, a need to better understand how microclimatic changes (soil temperature, soil moisture and water table depth) are affecting their functioning. Experimental studies on Sphagnum peatlands conducted under precisely controlled (e.g. mesocosm) conditions are relatively rare, especially those aiming to understand the system as a whole. Furthermore, mesocosm designs are generally described only briefly in the literature. In this article we provide a comprehensive account of a mesocosm experiment designed to study the response of Sphagnum peatlands to water table manipulation. We describe our experimental setup (3 water levels x 3 amplitudes of water table fluctuation x 5 replicates); and explain how we built the mesocosms, the issues we faced and the solutions we chose to solve them. We provide a detailed description of the devices we conceived to manipulate the water level, including software codes and electronic diagrams (as supplementary material), and explain how to address data loss in such an experimental design. We show that it is possible to build a reliable and powerful experimental setup at moderate cost using standard technology. The aim of this article is to provide a useful resource for researchers wishing to design similar experiments in the future.

AB The South American Altiplano is one of the largest semiarid high-altitude plateaus in the world. Within the Altiplano, peatlands known as "bofedales" are important components of regional hydrology and provide key water resources and ecosystem services to Andean communities. Warming temperatures, changes in hydroclimate, and shifting atmospheric circulation patterns all affect peatland dynamics and hydrology. It is therefore urgent to better understand the relationships between climate variability and the spatiotemporal variations in peatland productivity across the Altiplano. Here, we explore climate influences on peatland vegetation using 31 years of Landsat data. We focus specifically on the bofedal network in the western Altiplano, the driest sector of the plateau, and use the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator of productivity. We develop temporally and spatially continuous NDVI products at multiple scales in order to evaluate relationships with climate variables over the past three decades. We demonstrate that cumulative precipitation and snow persistence over the prior 2 years are strongly associated with growing season productivity. A step change in peatland productivity between 2013-2015 drives an increasing trend in NDVI and is likely a response to consecutive years of anomalously high snow accumulation and rainfall. Early summer minimum temperatures emerge as a secondary influence on productivity. Understanding large-scale productivity dynamics and characterizing the response of bofedales to climate variability over the last three decades provides a baseline to monitor the responses of Andean peatlands to climate change.

AB We developed a high-resolution MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 model of a 231.3 ha headwater catchment in the granitic uplands of the French Massif Central to estimate the contribution of groundwater upwelling to the water balance of the Dauges mire, an acidic valley mire of international importance for nature conservation. We estimated that groundwater upwelling from the underlying weathered granite formations - mostly an approximately 55 m deep fissured zone - provides 27.1 % of total long-term inflows to the mire. This contribution increases to 37.2 % in September when total inflows are small. Overland boundary inflow accounts for an average of 40.2 % of total inflows. However, most of this originates from groundwater seepage through mineral soils along the mire margins or in small non-channelised valleys upslope of the mire. A sensitivity analysis showed that model performance in terms of the simulation of mire groundwater levels was most sensitive to parameters describing the mineral soils and weathered granite formations rather than the overlying peat layer. Variation partitioning demonstrated that groundwater upwelling was the most important factor driving simulated monthly groundwater table depth within the mire. Sustained groundwater upwelling maintains the mire water table close to or at ground level for most of the year. As a result, precipitation and overland boundary inflows quickly leave the wetland as saturation-excess runoff. There was close agreement between the observed distribution of mire habi- tats and areas where the simulated long-term groundwater seepage rate was larger than zero in September. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to the assumed small contribution of groundwater to the hydrology of hard-rock regions, groundwater upwelling from underlying weathered formations can be a quantitatively important and functionally critical element of the water balance of valley mires in granitic headwater catchments. These results have important legal and management implications.

AB Peatlands cover about 21% of the landscape and contain about 80% of the soil carbon stock in western Canada. However, the current rates of carbon accumulation and the environmental controls on ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration in peatland ecosystems are poorly understood. As part of Fluxnet-Canada, we continuously measured net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) using the eddy covariance, technique in a treed fen dominated by stunted Picea mariana and Larix laricina trees during August 2003-December 2004. The total carbon stock in the ecosystem was approximately 51,000 g C m(-2), with only 540 g C m(-2) contributed by live above ground vegetation. The NEE measurements were used to parameterize simple physiological models to assess temporal variation in maximum ecosystem photosynthesis (A(max)) and ecosystem respiration rate at 10 degrees C (R-10). During mid-summer the ecosystem had a relatively high A(max) (approx. 30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) with relatively low R-10 (approx. 4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The peak mid-day NEE uptake rate during July and August was 10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The ecosystem showed large seasonal variation in photosynthetic and respiratory activity that was correlated with shifts in temperature, with both spring increases and fall decreases in A(max) well predicted by the mean daily air temperature averaged over the preceding 21 days. Leaf-level gas exchange and spectral reflectance measurements also suggested that seasonal changes in photosynthetic activity were primarily controlled by shifts in temperature. Ecosystem respiration was strongly correlated with changes in ecosystem photosynthesis during the growing season, suggesting important links between plant activity and mycorrhizae and microbial activity in the shallow layers of the peat. Only very low rates of respiration were observed during the winter months. During 2004, the peatland recorded a net annual gain of 144 g C m(-2) year(-1), the result of a difference between gross photosynthesis of 713 and total ecosystem respiration of 569 g C m(-2) year(-1).

AB Over a period of 1 yr, we examined the dynamics of a community of enchytraeid worms in a blanket peat soil in relation to the prevailing climate and the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Our objectives were two-fold: first, we aimed to establish whether there is a relationship between climatic variables and the density of enchytraeid populations; and also assess whether changes in the density of enchytraeid populations, caused by climate, were related to the release of DOC. Our second aim was to predict the consequences of atmospheric warming for the enchytraeid community at the site, and, in turn, the biological contribution to DOC release. Positive linear relationships between the abundance of enchytraeids and soil temperature were found, as well as with concentrations of DOC in the soil solution: We calculate that at mean field density, enchytraeids currently account for up to 26% of the DOC produced in the surface (upper 10 cm) blanket peat. These relationships suggest that future soil warming caused by climate change could increase enchytraeid abundance by 43% and C release by 11% in these peatlands, based on an increase in mean monthly air temperatures of 2.5 degreesC.

AB Elevated nitrogen deposition and climate change alter the vegetation communities and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in peatlands. To address this issue we developed a new process-oriented biogeochemical model (PEATBOG) for analyzing coupled carbon and nitrogen dynamics in northern peatlands. The model consists of four submodels, which simulate: (1) daily water table depth and depth profiles of soil moisture, temperature and oxygen levels; (2) competition among three plants functional types (PFTs), production and litter production of plants; (3) decomposition of peat; and (4) production, consumption, diffusion and export of dissolved C and N species in soil water. The model is novel in the integration of the C and N cycles, the explicit spatial resolution belowground, the consistent conceptualization of movement of water and solutes, the incorporation of stoichiometric controls on elemental fluxes and a consistent conceptualization of C and N reactivity in vegetation and soil organic matter. The model was evaluated for the Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, with regards to simulation of soil moisture and temperature and the most important processes in the C and N cycles. Model sensitivity was tested for nitrogen input, precipitation, and temperature, and the choices of the most uncertain parameters were justified. A simulation of nitrogen deposition over 40 yr demonstrates the advantages of the PEATBOG model in tracking biogeochemical effects and vegetation change in the ecosystem.

AB Climate change models predict a possible increase in air temperature of 2-8 degrees C. This means that global warming will significantly affect the functioning of various types of hydrogenic ecosystems. However, the effect of the temperature increase on microbial loop function in small water bodies associated with peat ecosystems (peat pools andSphagnumhollows) is still unknown. We used mesocosm experiments (control and treatments with a 2 degrees C, 4 degrees C and 8 degrees C temperature increase) to determine the response of bacterioplankton, flagellates, testate amoebae and ciliates to simulated temperature changes, taking into account seasonal variation in the temperate climate zone. The simulated increase in climate warming increased the species richness of ciliates and the abundance of bacteria, flagellates and ciliates. In contrast, there was a decrease in the species number and abundance of testate amoebae, the top predators in peat ecosystems. The sensitivity of the various microbial groups to temperature was size-dependent; large-sized testate amoebae declined under warming. These shifts caused a decrease in the predator-prey mass ratio. An increase in the abundance of top predators promotes increased abundance of ciliates, and thus changes the architecture of the food web. At the same time, we observed the increase in phycoflora biomass thus can cancel the potential negative effects of warming on heterotrophic microbial activity. So, the potential effect of warming on the C budgets of peat pools and hollows is evident. A better understanding of what regulates microbial populations and activity in small reservoirs in peat bogs and unravelling of these fundamental mechanisms are particularly critical to more accurately predict how peat bogs will respond to climate disturbances.

AB Individuals of Sphagnum capillifolium were cultured for 2 mo under six different combinations of nighttime temperature and nutrients. Low nighttime temperature caused a five-fold reduction of growth. Growth was also reduced when the plants were cultured without any addition of nutrient in the growing medium, but only when nutrient deficiency was coupled with high nighttime temperature. Growth reduction was associated with decreased rates of net photosynthesis, but was not accompanied by a degradation of photosynthetic pigments and/or variations in the pigment ratios, nor was the ultrastructure of chloroplasts significantly altered. The decline in the net photosynthetic rate may be due to a limitation in the enzymatic reactions at unfavorable temperatures. Nitrogen and, especially, phosphorus appeared to limit growth of Sphagnum capillifolium at optimal temperatures. A nighttime temperature of 5 degrees C was above the lower threshold triggering the synthesis of red wall-pigments, Known to be promoted by nighttime chilling. Climate warming is expected to increase the growth rates of Sphagnum, but the consequences on the carbon balance of peatlands cannot be predicted because temperature rise may also enhance breakdown of peat.

AB Sphagnum cuspidatum, S. magellanicum and S. rubellum are three co-occurring peat mosses, which naturally have a different distribution along the microtopographical gradient of the surface of peatlands. We set out an experiment to assess the interactive effects of water table (low: -10 cm and high: -1 cm) and precipitation (present or absent) on the CO2 assimilation and evaporation of these species over a 23-day period. Additionally, we measured which sections of the moss layer were responsible for light absorption and bulk carbon uptake. Thereafter, we investigated how water content affected carbon uptake by the mosses. Our results show that at high water table, CO2 assimilation of all species gradually increased over time, irrespective of the precipitation. At low water table, net CO2 assimilation of all species declined over time, with the earliest onset and highest rate of decline for S. cuspidatum. Precipitation compensated for reduced water tables and positively affected the carbon uptake of all species. Almost all light absorption occurred in the first centimeter of the Sphagnum vegetation and so did net CO2 assimilation. CO2 assimilation rate showed species-specific relationships with capitulum water content, with narrow but contrasting optima for S. cuspidatum and S. rubellum. Assimilation by S. magellanicum was constant at a relatively low rate over a broad range of capitulum water contents. Our study indicates that prolonged drought may alter the competitive balance between species, favoring hummock species over hollow species. Moreover, this study shows that precipitation is at least equally important as water table drawdown and should be taken into account in predictions about the fate of peatlands with respect to climate change.

AB Peatlands are important carbon (C) stores as a result of acidity, waterlogging conditions and low temperatures slowing decomposition rates. However, climate change is predicted to bring not only changes in abiotic conditions but also the replacement of peat-forming vegetation, such as Sphagnum mosses, with vascular plants. In these systems, enchytraeid worms represent the dominant mesofaunal group, and previous climate change manipulations have shown that their abundances and vertical distribution are strongly influenced by temperature and moisture gradients, with important implications for C cycling. Therefore, determining their behavioural responses to changes in both abiotic and biotic factors is crucial to quantify their contribution to decomposition processes.
   We investigated the importance of vertical edaphic gradients (soil moisture and labile C) on enchytraeids total numbers, vertical distribution and feeding activities by inverting intact soil cores and hence, reversing both substrate quality but leaving the microclimatic gradients intact. This manipulative experiment was set up in two different peatland areas, one dominated by heather (Erica mackaiana) and another by mosses (Sphagnum sp.) to determine the influence of different plant functional growth forms on these responses.
   Our results showed that most enchytraeid species were 'stayers' (i.e. in the 'Upturned cores', they remained in the same layer where they are 'Normally' located), and hence, their vertical distribution was more dependent on substrate quality than a change in microclimate. This response was more evident under drier conditions (i.e. the highest locations of the height gradient at the heather site) than at the wettest locations (i.e. the bottom of the slope and under mosses) due to more pronounced vertical gradients in substrate quality. Furthermore, radiocarbon measurements on enchytraeid tissues showed that to avoid competition among the growing populations for the limited labile resources present in the top layers, enchytraeids selected older C sources.
   These findings indicate that future climate change scenarios will not only bring important changes in the abiotic conditions (temperature and moisture) and biotic properties of peatlands (both vegetation composition and below-ground soil biota community structure and vertical distribution) but also alterations in the feeding preferences of key decomposers that could result in the mobilization of previously unavailable C pools.

AB Northern regions are experiencing considerable climate change affecting the state of permafrost, peat accumulation rates, and the large pool of carbon (C) stored in soil, thereby emphasizing the importance of monitoring surface C fluxes in different landform sites along a climate gradient. We studied surface net C exchange (NCE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across different landforms (upland, peat plateau, collapse scar) in mid-boreal to high subarctic ecoregions in the Mackenzie Valley of northwestern Canada for three years. NCE and ER were measured using automatic CO2 chambers (ADC, Bioscientific LTD., Herts, England), and soil respiration (SR) was measured with solid state infrared CO2 sensors (Carbocaps, Vaisala, Vantaa, Finland) using the concentration gradient technique. Both NCE and ER were primarily controlled by soil temperature in the upper horizons. In upland forest locations, ER varied from 583 to 214 g C.m(-2).year(-1) from mid-boreal to high subarctic zones, respectively. For the bog and peat plateau areas, ER was less than half that at the upland locations. Of SR, nearly 75% was generated in the upper 5 cm layer composed of live bryophytes and actively decomposing fibric material. Our results suggest that for the upland and bog locations, ER significantly exceeded NCE. Bryophyte NCE was greatest in continuously waterlogged collapsed areas and was negligible in other locations. Overall, upland forest sites were sources of CO2 (from 64 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in the high subarctic to 588 g C.m(-2).year(-1) in mid-boreal zone); collapsed areas were sinks of C, especially in high subarctic (from 27 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in mid-boreal to 86 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in high subarctic) and peat plateaus were minor sources (from 153 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in mid-boreal to 6 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in high subarctic). The results are important in understanding how different landforms are responding to climate change and would be useful in modeling the effect of future climate change on the soil C balance in the northern regions.

AB In this paper we present a model of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and fluxes in mire water based on the convection-dispersion equation. The dynamics of sorbed, potentially soluble organic carbon (SPSOC) in the peat matrix are simulated in parallel with DOC. First, the model is applied solely to stagnant water conditions in order to interpret the results of laboratory peat incubations, with the focus on sorption processes. Some important model parameters are derived using literature data complemented by information from new incubation experiments. Second, the model is fully applied to simulate the DOC concentrations in the outlet of a steam draining a small headwater mire in northern Sweden during the period 1993-2001. A relatively good model fit (mean bias error (MBE) = -0.6-2.2 mg L-1, Willmott index of agreement d > 0.7 for the daily concentrations) was found for all the categories of stream discharge, except periods with very low flow (q < 0.3 mm d(-1)). When seeking explanations for the interannual variability in DOC concentrations, we, like previous authors, could find the influence of temperature, flow path, and intensity. However, the model has helped to demonstrate that the system also has a "memory'': the store of sorbed, potentially soluble organic carbon in a year affects the DOC concentrations and fluxes in the following year.

AB Drained peat soils are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. Rewetting these soils is considered an important climate change mitigation tool to reduce emissions and create suitable conditions for carbon sequestration. Long-term monitoring is essential to capture interannual variations in GHG emissions and associated environmental variables and to reduce the uncertainty linked with GHG emission factor calculations. In this study, we present GHG balances: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) calculated for a 5-year period at a rewetted industrial cutaway peatland in Ireland (rewetted 7years prior to the start of the study); and compare the results with an adjacent drained area (2-year data set), and with ten long-term data sets from intact (i.e. undrained) peatlands in temperate and boreal regions. In the rewetted site, CO2 exchange (or net ecosystem exchange (NEE)) was strongly influenced by ecosystem respiration (R-eco) rather than gross primary production (GPP). CH4 emissions were related to soil temperature and either water table level or plant biomass. N2O emissions were not detected in either drained or rewetted sites. Rewetting reduced CO2 emissions in unvegetated areas by approximately 50%. When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the emission factors (calculated as 5-year mean of annual balances) for the rewetted site were (+/- SD) -104 +/- 80g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CO2 sink) and 9 +/- 2g CH4-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CH4 source). Nearly a decade after rewetting, the GHG balance (100-year global warming potential) had reduced noticeably (i.e. less warming) in comparison with the drained site but was still higher than comparative intact sites. Our results indicate that rewetted sites may be more sensitive to interannual changes in weather conditions than their more resilient intact counterparts and may switch from an annual CO2 sink to a source if triggered by slightly drier conditions.

AB Extreme precipitation events are recognised as important drivers of ecosystem responses to climate change and can considerably affect high-latitude ombrotrophic bogs. Therefore, understanding the relationships between increased rainfall and the biotic components of these ecosystems is necessary for an estimation of climate change impacts. We studied overall effects of increased magnitude, intensity and frequency of rainfall on assemblages of Sphagnum-dwelling testate amoebae in a field climate manipulation experiment located in a relatively dry subarctic bog (Abisko, Sweden). The effects of the treatment were estimated using abundance, species diversity and structure of living and empty shell assemblages of testate amoebae in living and decaying layers of Sphagnum. Our results show that increased rainfall reduced the mean abundance and species richness of living testate amoebae. Besides, the treatment affected species structure of both living and empty shell assemblages, reducing proportions of hydrophilous species. The effects are counterintuitive as increased precipitation-related substrate moisture was expected to have opposite effects on testate amoeba assemblages in relatively dry biotopes. Therefore, we conclude that other rainfall-related factors such as increased infiltration rates and frequency of environmental disturbances can also affect testate amoeba assemblages in Sphagnum and that hydrophilous species are particularly sensitive to variation in these environmental variables.

AB High-altitude cushion peatlands are versatile archives for high-resolution palaeoenvironmental studies, due to their high accumulation rates, range of proxies, and sensitivity to climatic and/or human-induced changes. Especially within the Central Andes, the knowledge about climate conditions during the Holocene is limited. In this study, we present the environmental and climatic history for the last 2100 years of Cerro Tuzgle peatland (CTP), located in the dry Puna of NW Argentina, based on a multi-proxy approach. X-ray fluorescence (XRF), stable isotope and element content analyses (delta C-13, delta N-15, TN and TOC) were conducted to analyse the inorganic geochemistry throughout the sequence, revealing changes in the peatlands' past redox conditions. Pollen assemblages give an insight into substantial environmental changes on a regional scale. The palaeoclimate varied significantly during the last 2100 years. The results reflect prominent late Holocene climate anomalies and provide evidence that in situ moisture changes were coupled to the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). A period of sustained dry conditions prevailed from around 150BC to around AD150. A more humid phase dominated between AD200 and AD550. Afterwards, the climate was characterised by changes between drier and wetter conditions, with droughts at around AD650-800 and AD 1000-1100. Volcanic forcing at the beginning of the 19th century (1815 Tambora eruption) seems to have had an impact on climatic settings in the Central Andes. In the past, the peatland recovered from climatic perturbations. Today, CTP is heavily degraded by human interventions, and the peat deposit is becoming increasingly susceptible to erosion and incision.

AB Peatlands are ecosystems for which carbon budget relies strongly on the meteorological and hydrological conditions. Here, using a manipulative field experiment, we measured ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) over two years (2013-2014) in a poor fen in Poland to estimate the carbon emission in a changing climate. The experiment consisted of warming (open-top chambers - OTC) and water table manipulation. The application of OTC increased the mean values of daily maximum air temperature by approx. 1.1-1.8 A degrees C. Warming or the increased water table depth separately resulted in an increase in ecosystem respiration by approx. 0.1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and 0.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. However, our results show also the additive nature of warming and water table drawdown impact on daily R-ECO during the studied years (2013-0.80 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and 2014-1.16 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). With the natural dry period event which occurred in 2014, the seasonal R-ECO increased by approx. 0.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) as compared to the previous year. Projected global warming will therefore significantly enhance C loss from poor fens in this region of Europe.

AB Wetland stores substantial amount of carbon and may contribute greatly to global climate change debate. However, few researches have focused on the effects of global climate change on carbon mineralization in Zoig alpine wetland, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is one of the most important peatlands in China. Through incubation experiment, this paper studied the effects of temperature, soil moisture, soil type (marsh soil and peat soil) and their interactions on CO2 and CH4 emission rates in Zoig alpine wetland. Results show that when the temperature rises from 5A degrees C to 35A degrees C, CO2 emission rates increase by 3.3-3.7 times and 2.4-2.6 times under non-inundation treatment, and by 2.2-2.3 times and 4.1-4.3 times under inundation treatment in marsh soil and peat soil, respectively. Compared with non-inundation treatment, CO2 emission rates decrease by 6%-44%, 20%-60% in marsh soil and peat soil, respectively, under inundation treatment. CO2 emission rate is significantly affected by the combined effects of the temperature and soil type (p < 0.001), and soil moisture and soil type (p < 0.001), and CH4 emission rate was significantly affected by the interaction of the temperature and soil moisture (p < 0.001). Q (10) values for CO2 emission rate are higher at the range of 5A degrees C-25A degrees C than 25A degrees C-35A degrees C, indicating that carbon mineralization is more sensitive at low temperature in Zoig alpine wetland.

AB Global peatlands store an unparalleled proportion of total global organic carbon but it is vulnerable to erosion into fluvial systems. Fluvial networks are being recognized as areas of carbon transformation, with eroded particulate organic carbon processed to dissolved organic carbon and CO2. Existing studies indicate biodegradation and photodegradation as key processes controlling the transformation of organic carbon in fluvial systems, with initial concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) identified as a control on the rate of carbon mineralization. This study manipulates temperature and incident light intensity to investigate carbon mineralization rates in laboratory simulations of peatland sediment transport into fluvial systems. By directly measuring gaseous CO2 emissions from sampled stream water, the relationship of temperature and light intensity with carbon efflux is identified. In simulations where sediment (as particulate organic matter, POM) is absent, temperature is consistently the dominant factor influencing carbon efflux rates. This influence is independent of the initial DOC concentration of the water sample. In simulations where POM was added, representing a peatland river receiving eroded terrestrial sediment, initial DOC concentration predicts 79% of the variation in total gaseous carbon efflux whereas temperature and light intensity predict 12% and 3%, respectively. When sampled stream water's mineralization rates in the presence of added POM are analysed independently, removing DOC as a model variable, the dominant variable affecting CO2 efflux is opposite for each sample. This study presents novel data suggesting peatland erosion introduces further complexity to dynamic stream systems where rates of carbon transformation processes and the influence of specific environmental variables are interdependent. Anthropogenic climate change is identified as a leading risk factor perpetuating peatland erosion; therefore, understanding the fate of terrestrial sediment in rivers and further quantifying the benefits of protecting peatland soils will be of increasing importance to carbon budgeting and ecosystem function studies.

AB Arctic peatlands store large stocks of organic carbon which are vulnerable to the climate change but their fate is uncertain. There is increasing evidence that a part of it will be lost as a result of faster microbial mineralization. We studied the vulnerability of 3500-5900 years old bare peat uplifted from permafrost layers by cryogenic processes to the surface of an arctic peat plateau. We aimed to find biotic and abiotic drivers of C-LOSS from old peat and compare them with those of adjacent, young vegetated soils of the peat plateau and mineral tundra. The soils were incubated in laboratory at three temperatures (4A degrees C, 12A degrees C and 20A degrees C) and two oxygen levels (aerobic, anaerobic). C-LOSS was monitored and soil parameters (organic carbon quality, nutrient availability, microbial activity, biomass and stoichiometry, and extracellular oxidative and hydrolytic enzyme pools) were determined. We found that C-LOSS from the old peat was constrained by low microbial biomass representing only 0.22% of organic carbon. C-LOSS was only slightly reduced by the absence of oxygen and exponentially increased with temperature, showing the same temperature sensitivity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We conclude that carbon in the old bare peat is stabilized by a combination of physical, chemical and biological controls including soil compaction, organic carbon quality, low microbial biomass and the absence of plants.Decomposition of old organic deposits in arctic peatlands is slow due to scarcity of microorganisms there but is highly sensitive to temperature increase, even under anaerobic conditions.Decomposition of old organic deposits in arctic peatlands is slow due to scarcity of microorganisms there but is highly sensitive to temperature increase, even under anaerobic conditions.

AB Northern peatlands contain a considerable share of the terrestrial carbon (C) pool, which climate change will likely affect in the future. The magnitude of this effect, however, remains uncertain, due mainly to difficulties in predicting decomposition rates in the old peat layers. We studied the effects of water level depth (WL) and soil temperature on heterotrophic soil respiration originating from peat decomposition (R(PD)) in six drained peatlands using a chamber technique. The microbial community structure was determined through PLFA. Within the studied sites, temperature appeared to be the main driver of R(PD). However, our results indicate that there exist mechanisms related to lower WL conditions that can tone down the effect of temperature on R(PD). These mechanisms were described with a mathematical model that included the optimum WL response of R(PD) and the effect of average WL conditions on the temperature sensitivity of R(PD). The following implications were apparent from the model parameterisation: (1) The instantaneous effect of WL on R(PD) followed a Gaussian form: the optimum WL for R(PD) was 61 cm. The tolerance of R(PD) to the WL however, was rather broad, indicating that the overall effect of WL was relatively weak. (2) The temperature sensitivity of R(PD) depended on the average WL of the plot: plots with a high average WL showed higher temperature sensitivity than did those under drier conditions. This variation in temperature sensitivity of R(PD) Correlated with microbial community structure. Thus, moisture stress in the surface peat layer or, alternatively, the lowered temperature sensitivity of R(PD) in low water level conditions via microbial community structure and biomass may restrict R(PD). We conclude that a warmer future climate may raise R(PD) in drained peatlands only if the subsequent decrease in the moisture of the surface peat layers is minor and, thus, conditions remain favourable for decomposition.

AB Rewetting of drained fens with NO3- enriched water from agricultural watersheds has been proposed as a valid strategy to reduce NO3- load of water courses although their role as dissolved nitrogen (DN) sinks remain unclear because the export of reduced nitrogen forms (NH4+, DON) may exceed NO3- removal. A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the importance of temperature, nitrogen load and the degree of peat decomposition on the role of rewetted fens as DN sinks. Different peat substrates of one degraded drained fen in NE Germany were incubated under stagnant water conditions. Two degrees of peat decomposition (Highly decomposed: HD; Moderately decomposed: MD), two nitrogen loads (Low nitrogen, LN, 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); High nitrogen, HN, 140 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and two incubation temperatures (20 degrees C and 5 degrees C) were examined. Moreover, net N mineralisation and N microbial immobilisation were also estimated to gain useful insights on the role of the considered factors over processes involved on DN turnover. Under all scenarios considered in this study, fen rewetting was shown to be a valid strategy to recover the function of fens as DN sinks, although large variability on the retention efficiency was observed (similar to 15-75%). N load increased NO3- (LN: 7.9 +/- 1.0 mg N m(-2) d(-1); HN: 19.3 +/- 3.1 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and DN (LN: 5.1 +/- 0.8 mg N m(-2) d(-1); HN: 16.5 +/- 2.4 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) removal, even though the depletion of the added NO3- by organic matter decomposition took place only at the peat surface. Peat decomposition strongly influenced DN turnover due to differences in the size of the mobile organic carbon (C) (HD: 132 +/- 7 mg c g(-1) dry matter (DM); MD: 68 +/- 2 mg C g(-1) DM) and N (HD: 9.3 +/- 0.5 mg N g(-1) DM; MD: 2.8 +/- 0.1 mg N g(-1) DM) pools. As a result, NO3- removal, net N mineralisation, N microbial immobilisation and NH4+ export were higher for highly decomposed peat. In addition, a higher incubation temperature increased NO removal rates (20 degrees C: 18.6 +/- 3.0 mg N m(-2) d(-1); 5 degrees C: 8.5 +/- 1.7 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). Moreover, DN removal was much higher at 20 degrees C (20 degrees C: 14.9 +/- 2.6 mg N m(-2) d(-1); 5 degrees C: 6.7 +/- 1.6 mg N m(-2) d(-1)), but lower than NO3- removal rates underpinning the importance of N mineralisation. The results from our study should be considered prior to restore degraded fens. Removing the highly decomposed peat layer, which has been proposed as a method to reduce nutrient release in rewetted fens, can hamper the N removal potential to some extent, especially at high N loading rates.

AB By the end of this century, much of the climate space of western Canada's boreal forest is expected to shift northwards and be replaced by climates that are currently associated with aspen forest, parkland and grassland ecosystems. In this study, we review the various processes that will mediate ecological responses to these projected changes in climate. We conclude that ecological transitions are unlikely to involve a gradual wave-like shift in ecotonal boundaries. Instead, we predict that ecological changes will lag substantially behind changes in climate and that individual ecosystem components will respond at different rates. In particular, if precipitation inputs are maintained as expected, then peatlands should exhibit considerable resilience to climate change and remain a dominant feature on the landscape in 2100. Because peatlands retain large amounts of water on the landscape their continued presence may in turn slow the rate of forest loss, especially the aspen component. Thus, ecological response to climate change in the western boreal region may involve a transition to a novel ecosystem that includes peatlands and aspen as dominant features -unlike anything that exists today. Moreover, this interim stage may remain in place well into the next century, potentially providing additional time for forest-dependent species to adapt. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the short-term (1-3years) vs. long-term (11years) effects of intensified winter soil frost (induced by experimental snow exclusion) on CH4 exchange during the following growing season in a boreal peatland. In the first 3years (2004-2006), lower CH4 emissions in the treatment plots relative to the control coincided with delayed soil temperature increase in the treatment plots at the beginning of the growing season (May). After 11 treatment years (in 2014), CH4 emissions were lower in the treatment plots relative to the control over the entire growing season, resulting in a reduction in total growing season CH4 emission by 27%. From May to July 2014, reduced sedge leaf area coincided with lower CH4 emissions in the treatment plots compared to the control. From July to August, lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the pore water of the treatment plots explained 72% of the differences in CH4 emission between control and treatment. In addition, greater Sphagnum moss growth in the treatment plots resulted in a larger distance between the moss surface and the water table (i.e., increasing the oxic layer) which may have enhanced the CH4 oxidation potential in the treatment plots relative to the control in 2014. The differences in vegetation might also explain the lower temperature sensitivity of CH4 emission observed in the treatment plots relative to the control. Overall, this study suggests that greater soil frost, associated with future winter climate change, might substantially reduce the growing season CH4 emission in boreal peatlands through altering vegetation dynamics and subsequently causing vegetation-mediated effects on CH4 exchange.

AB Factors controlling the flux of the radiatively important trace gas methane (CH4) from boreal wetlands were examined at three sites along a moisture gradient from a treed low-shrub bog to an open floating graminoid bog in Fairbanks, Alaska. In the summer of 1992 average static chamber flux measurements were -0.02, 71.5, and 289 mg CH4/m(2)/d in dry, wet, and floating mat communities, respectively. In contrast, the warmer, drier 1993 field season flux measurements were -0.02, 42.9 and 407 mg CH4/m(2)/d. The data indicate that despite net oxidation of CH4 in the dry regions of the bog, the wetland is a net source of CH4, with fluxes ranging across three orders of magnitude between different plant communities. Comparison with water levels suggests that CH4 flux is turned on and off by changes in site hydrology. In sites where sufficient moisture is present for methanogenesis to occur, CH4 flux appears to be temperature limited, responding exponentially to soil temperature changes. The combined effects of hydrology and temperature create hot spots of CH4 flux within boreal wetlands. The plant communities within Lemeta Bog respond differently to changes in temperature and moisture availability, creating both positive and negative feedbacks to potential global climate change.

AB 1. Peatlands are a significant store of global carbon (C) and may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Understanding the drivers of C cycling in peatlands is therefore important for predicting feedbacks to climate change. One such driver may be the identity of component plant species. 2. Moss species contribute significantly to peatland vegetation, yet we understand comparatively little of their role in short-term C cycling and whether that role is consistent regardless of environmental context. 3. We examined the impact of three dominant, co-occurring moss species (Hypnum jutlandicum, Sphagnum capillifolium and Plagiothecium undulatum) on C cycling across a long-term fire frequency experiment, where plots have been burnt every 10 years, every 20 years or have not been burnt since 1954. We measured species effects on in situ net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and decomposition environments, and moss species litter decomposition rates in a laboratory experiment. The fire experiment also provided an ideal opportunity to test whether moss species effects were consistent regardless of context. 4. Moss-dominated patches were on average net sources of CO2 over the main growing period, with Sphagnum-dominated patches showing the lowest NEE. The presence of mosses reduced peat temperature, but this was insufficient to cause differences in the decomposition rate of a standard substrate. Sphagnum and Hypnum litter decomposed more slowly (17 and 16% mass loss, respectively) than Plagiothecium litter (64% mass loss) over a 42-week incubation period. 5. Fire frequency treatments had few effects on measures of C cycling. Moss effects were generally consistent regardless of fire frequency treatment, but Plagiothecium and Sphagnum litter collected from the no-fire plots had higher rates of decomposition than litter collected from the plots burnt more frequently. 6. In summary, postfire, both inter- and intraspecific differences in mosses had significant effects on short-term C cycling. Consequently, changes in both moss species composition and variation within species may need to be taken into account to accurately predict C cycling in peatland ecosystems subject to fire.

AB Peatlands play an essential role in carbon cycling and global warming. However, the feedback of peatlands to global changes is still unclear. Here, we conducted a data synthesis of 236 observations from 52 field experiments to evaluate the effect of three important global changes (warming, nitrogen addition, and vegetation composition change) on three major greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes: CO2, CH4, and N2O. The results showed that (i) GHG responses to warming varied among warming methods, between air temperature increase rates, and between warming durations; (ii) GHG responses to N addition varied between peatland types, between N forms, between N concentrations, and between experimental durations; (iii) the response rates of GHGs were associated with local environmental parameters (mean annual precipitation, MAP; and water table level, WTL); (iv) the global warming potential (GWP) considerably increased under these global changes, which indicates that cooling function of peatlands will be weakened. Overall, given these global changes occur simultaneously, the interaction of them on GHG fluxes should not be ignored. Our results highlight that a large number of studies in different locations are needed to comprehensively understand and accurately predict GHG emissions from peatlands.

AB Peatlands are common components of the Northeast Asian landscapes, while the vegetation and hydrological variations of these peatlands remain unclear. To address this issue, here we use plant macrofossil and grain size analyses to reconstruct the regional vegetation and hydrology dynamics of the Hani peatland over the past similar to 7766 years. From 7766 cal. yr BP to 6000 cal. yr BP, the Hani peatland was characterized by wet conditions and high water levels. The vegetation community was mainly composed of hygrophilic plants during this period. These features were probably controlled by the high total solar irradiation (TSI) and less El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activities. From 6000 cal. yr BP to 2000 cal. yr BP, the Hani peatland was characterized by moderate moisture conditions and decreasing water levels, with the vegetation community dominated by both hygrophilic and xerophilic plants. These features were probably influenced by the decreased TSI and increased ENSO activities. From 2000 cal. yr BP to the present, the Hani peatland was characterized by dry conditions and low water levels composed mainly of xerophilic plants. These features were linked to low TSI and more ENSO activities. These correlations reveal that the millennial scale changes of the peatlands in Northeast Asia were primarily driven by the collective impacts of solar irradiation and ENSO activity, thus expanding our understanding of long term interactions between vegetation, hydrology, and climate of Northeast Asian peatlands.

AB The ongoing pressures of climate change, as expressed by the increased intensity, duration, and frequency of temperature and precipitation events, threatens the storage of carbon in northern latitudes. One key concern is how these events will affect the production, mobilization, and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the main form of aquatic carbon export in these regions. In this study, we retrospectively show contrasting effects of climate extremes over 23 years on two adjacent boreal catchments, one dominated by forest cover and the other draining a mire (wetland), despite experiencing the same extreme climate events. During the peak snowmelt, DOC concentrations ranged from 20 to 33 mg l(-1) in the forest catchment and 10-28 mg l(-1) in the mire catchment respectively, highlighting large inter-annual variation in the springtime hydrologicCexport at both sites. Weused climate and discharge variables to predict this variation, and found that DOC from the forested catchment, which is derived largely from riparian soils, had the highest concentrations following cold summers, dry autumns, and winters with high precipitation. By contrast, in the mire outlet, where DOC is primarily derived from decomposing peat, the highest DOC concentrations in the spring followed cold/dry winters and dry summers. Our results indicate that processes regulating stream DOC concentrations during spring in both catchments were dependent on both temperature and precipitation in multiple seasons. Together, these patterns suggest that DOC responses to climatic extremes are complex and generate variable patterns in springtime concentrations that are strongly dependent upon landscape context.

AB The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) and water table draw-down on soil carbon sequestration in an ombrotrophic bog ecosystem were examined. Peat monoliths (11 cm diameter, 25 cm deep) with intact bog vegetation were exposed to ambient or elevated (ambient + 200 mg l(-1)) atmospheric CO2, combined with a natural water table (level with the peat surface) or a water table draw-down (-5 cm). Eight observations per treatment were included in the study, which was conducted over a 12 week period. Concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phenolic compounds and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were measured. The eCO(2) treatment caused an increase in the CH4 and CO2 fluxes and a small decrease in both the DOC and phenolic concentrations. The water table draw-down invoked decreases in phenolic and DOC concentrations, a decrease in CH4 flux and a small increase in CO2 flux. The combined (eCO(2) + water table draw-down) treatment caused a larger than expected CH4 flux decrease and CO2 flux increase and an increase in DOC concentration. Our results suggest very different effects on the system dependent on the treatment applied. The draw-down treatment principally increased oxidation of the rhizosphere resulting in increased decomposition and as such a removal of material from the dissolved carbon pool. The data also suggest labile carbon availability may be limiting the rate of decomposition and so slowing inorganic nutrient and carbon pool turn-over. The elevated CO2 addressed the labile-carbon limitation. Under the environment of the combined treatment, these limitations were effectively removed, culminating in a destabilisation of the carbon-sequestering environment to a weaker sink (or even a source) of atmospheric carbon.

AB Hummocks. small earth or peat mounds, are widely distributed in the arctic and develop a., a consequence of biomass accumulation and cryoturbation in the active layer. There is general agreement that the type of vegetation covering peat hummocks may alter the accumulation rate of organic material and thus hummock growth and local carbon sink dynamics. Studies on hummock plant community compositions from the arctic are very scarce. Here, I present results of a case study from the arctic tree-line near Churchill, Manitoba (Canada). Vegetation composition, hummock height and soil moisture content were recorded in 40 peat hummocks located along a tree-line gradient from open forest to tundra. Based on a cluster analysis I found three moss-dominated types of hummock vegetation, according to (1) a Tomenthypnum nitens (golden fuzzy fen moss) type on low hummocks, (2) a Hylocomium spledens (stair-step moss) type on medium-sized hummocks, and (3) a Pleurozium schreberi (red-stemmed feathermoss) type on hummocks higher than 60-70 cm. I found hummock height to increase towards the forest interior with decreasing water content of the upper organic layer on the hummock top. This is indicated by a significant change in vegetation composition towards drought resistant moss species on higher hummocks. Furthermore, species richness decreased with increase in hummock height. Based on evidence from historical tree-line invasion the overall results suggest that hummock height increases due to peat accumulation over the course of time resulting in a typical change in plant community composition.

AB Due to their location at the southern margin of the Arid Diagonal, only a limited number of archives in the western Central Andes of Chile is capable for paleoclimate investigations. High-altitude cushion peatlands are potentially suitable to fill this gap despite their heterogenic stratigraphies representing past geomorphodynamics, especially for the Late Holocene. We investigated a 4 m sediment profile from the Lagunillas cushion peatland (LP, 27'12' S, 69 degrees 17 W), located in the dry Puna of the Western Central Andes. Directed by Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) measurements, sediment cores were recovered at the deepest point of the investigated valley section. In total, 10 radiocarbon samples were used to build the age-depth model resulting in a sediment chronology spanning the last 1800 cal. yr BR Core stratigraphy and ERT data were applied to allow insights into the sedimentary environment. Geochemical (X-ray fluorescence) and sedimentological (grain size) analyses were conducted to identify significant changes in sedimentation dynamics during the Late Holocene. Grain size analyses were investigated on 24 samples from peat layers as well as from stratigraphical sections characterized by allochthonous sediments. In combination with the results of the XRF measurements, evidence for changes in geomorphodynamic processes during the last 1800 cal. yr BP could be revealed.
   Our data disclose that investigations of heterogenic peat stratigraphies could also provide promising inferences about paleoclimatic changes. Within the Lagunillas record, stable phases of peat accumulation alternate with phases dominated by clastic material input. A stable phase of peat accumulation prevailed from 1750 cal. yr BP until about 1250 cal. yr BP and was followed by a phase with unstable conditions from 1250 to 980 cal. yr BP. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between 980 to 620 cal. yr BP, drier conditions prevailed at Lagunillas peatland, while shorter humid periods favored peat accumulation between 620 to 560 cal. yr BR Higher precipitation amounts were evident during the Little Ice Age (LIA) from 560-160 cal. yr BR During the period from 160 cal. yr BP to recent times, a higher frequency of changes between peat accumulation and clastic layers occurred, presumably due to a decreasing trend in precipitation.

AB Oceanic island flora is vulnerable to future climate warming, which is likely to promote changes in vegetation composition, and invasion of non-native species. Sub-Antarctic islands are predicted to experience rapid warming during the next century; therefore, establishing trajectories of change in vegetation communities is essential for developing conservation strategies to preserve biological diversity. We present a Late-glacial-early Holocene (16 500-6450 cal a bp) palaeoecological record from Hooker's Point, Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), South Atlantic. This period spans the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, providing insight into biological responses to abrupt climate change. Pollen and plant macrofossil records appear insensitive to climatic cooling during the Late-glacial, but undergo rapid turnover in response to regional warming. The absence of trees throughout the Late-glacial-early Holocene enables the recognition of far-travelled pollen from southern South America. The first occurrence of Nothofagus (southern beech) may reflect changes in the strength and/or position of the Southern Westerly Wind Belt during the Late-glacial period. Peat inception and accumulation at Hooker's Point is likely to be promoted by the recalcitrant litter of wind-adapted flora. This recalcitrant litter helps to explain widespread peatland development in a comparatively dry environment, and suggests that wind-adapted peatlands can remain carbon sinks even under low precipitation regimes.

AB We simulated the effect of prolonged dry summer periods by lowering the water table on three manipulation plots (D1-3) in a minerotrophic fen in southeastern Germany in three years (2006-2008). The water table at this site was lowered by drainage and by excluding precipitation; three nonmanipulated control plots (C1-3) served as a reference. We found no significant differences in soil respiration (R-Soil), gross primary production (GPP), or aboveground respiration (R-AG) between the C1-3 and D1-3 plots in any of the measurement years. The water table on the control plots was naturally low, with a median water table (2006-2008) of 8 cm below the surface, and even lower during summer when respiratory activity was highest, with median values (C1-3) between 11 and 19 cm below the surface. If it is assumed that oxygen availability in the uppermost 10 cm was not limited by the location of the water table, manipulative lowering of the water table most likely increased oxygen availability only in deeper peat layers where we expect R-Soil to be limited by poor substrate quality rather than anoxia. This could explain the lack of a manipulation effect. In a second approach, we estimated the influence of the water table on R-Soil irrespective of treatment. The results showed a significant correlation between R-Soil and water table, but with R-Soil decreasing at lower water tables rather than increasing. We thus conclude that decomposition in the litter layer is not limited by waterlogging in summer, and deeper peat layers bear no significant decomposition potential due to poor substrate quality. Consequently, we do not expect enhanced C losses from this site due to increasing frequency of dry summers. Assimilation and respiration of aboveground vegetation were not affected by water table fluctuations between 10 and >60 cm depth, indicating the lack of stress resulting from either anoxia (high water table) or drought (low water table).

AB Here, we describe and evaluate two low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) designed to remotely monitor wetland hydrochemical dynamics over time scales ranging from minutes to decades. Each WSN (one student-built and one commercial) has multiple nodes to monitor water level, precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, and major solutes at user-defined time intervals. Both WSNs can be configured to report data in near real time via the internet. Based on deployments in two isolated wetlands, we report highly resolved water budgets, transient reversals of flow path, rates of transpiration from peatlands and the dynamics of chromophoric-dissolved organic matter and bulk ionic solutes (specific conductivity)-all on daily or subdaily time scales. Initial results indicate that direct precipitation and evapotranspiration dominate the hydrologic budget of both study wetlands, despite their relatively flat geomorphology and proximity to elevated uplands. Rates of transpiration from peatland sites were typically greater than evaporation from open waters but were more challenging to integrate spatially. Due to the high specific yield of peat, the hydrologic gradient between peatland and open water varied with precipitation events and intervening periods of dry out. The resultant flow path reversals implied that the flux of solutes across the riparian boundary varied over daily time scales. We conclude that WSNs can be deployed in remote wetland-dominated ecosystems at relatively low cost to assess the hydrochemical impacts of weather, climate, and other perturbations.

AB The nature and extent to which hydrological changes induced by the Asian summer monsoon affected key biogeochemical processes remain poorly defined. This study explores the relationship between peatland drying and carbon cycling on centennial timescales in central China using lipid biomarkers. The difference between peat n-alkane delta H-2 and a nearby stalagmite delta O-18 record reveals that intervals of prominent peatland drying occurred during the mid-Holocene. Synchronous with these drier conditions, leaf wax delta C-13 values show large negative excursions, with the utilization of CO2 respired from the peatland subsurface for plant photosynthesis being a possible mechanism. Crucially, successive drying events appear to have had a cumulative impact on the susceptibility of peat carbon stores to climate change. Concurrently, bacterially derived hopane delta C-13 values suggest the occurrence of enhanced methane oxidation during the drier periods. Collectively, these observations expand our understanding of how respiration and degradation of peat are enhanced during drying events.

AB Wetlands are significant sources of atmospheric methane, an important radiatively active 'greenhouse' gas that accounts for an estimated 12% of total greenhouse warming. Since global climate models predict the greatest temperature and precipitation changes at high latitudes, acid as the largest areas of wetland (346 x 10(6) ha) are in the boreal and subarctic regions (40-70 degrees N), recent research has focused on identifying the factors that control methane emission from northern wetlands. Over the past few years, the database has expanded tremendously, and much progress has been made in understanding the environmental controls on methane emission at small spatial and temporal scales. However, we now need to broaden our understanding of regional differences in methane emission, ecological responses of northern wetlands to climate change, and the effect of other perturbations such as drainage and flooding.

AB Peatlands are complex ecosystems driven by many physical, chemical, and biological processes. Peat soils have a significant impact on water quality, ecosystem productivity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the extent of peatlands is decreasing across the world, mainly because of anthropogenic activities such as drainage for agriculture or groundwater abstractions in underlying aquifers. Potential changes in precipitation and temperature in the future are likely to apply additional pressure to wetland. In this context, a methodology for assessing and comparing the respective impacts of groundwater abstraction and climate change on a groundwater-fed wetland (135 km(2)) located in Northwest France, is presented. A groundwater model was developed, using flexible boundary conditions to represent surface-subsurface interactions which allowed examination of the extent of the wetland areas. This variable parameter is highly important for land management and is usually not considered in impact studies. The model was coupled with recharge estimation, groundwater abstraction scenarios, and climate change scenarios downscaled from 14 GCMs corresponding to the A1B greenhouse gas (GHG) scenario over the periods 1961-2000 and 2081-2100. Results show that climate change is expected to have an important impact and reduce the surface of wetlands by 5.3-13.6%. In comparison, the impact of groundwater abstraction (100% increase in the expected scenarios) would lead to a maximum decrease of 3.7%. Results also show that the impacts of climate change and groundwater abstraction could be partially mitigated by decreasing or stopping land drainage in specific parts of the area.

TI Divergent species-specific impacts of whole ecosystem warming and

   water potential
AB Boreal peatland forests have relatively low species diversity and thus impacts of climate change on one or more dominant species could shift ecosystem function. Despite abundant soil water availability, shallowly rooted vascular plants within peatlands may not be able to meet foliar demand for water under drought or heat events that increase vapor pressure deficits while reducing near surface water availability, although concurrent increases in atmospheric CO2 could buffer resultant hydraulic stress. We assessed plant water relations of co-occurring shrub (primarily Rhododendron groenlandicum and Chamaedaphne calyculata) and tree (Picea mariana and Larix laricina) species prior to, and in response to whole ecosystem warming (0 to +9 degrees C) and elevated CO2 using 12.8-m diameter open-top enclosures installed within an ombrotrophic bog. Water relations (water potential [psi], turgor loss point, foliar and root hydraulic conductivity) were assessed prior to treatment initiation, then psi and peak sap flow (trees only) assessed after 1 or 2 years of treatments. Under the higher temperature treatments, L. laricina psi exceeded its turgor loss point, increased its peak sap flow, and was not able to recover psi overnight. In contrast, P. mariana operated below its turgor loss point and maintained constant psi and sap flow across warming treatments. Similarly, C. calyculata psi stress increased with temperature while R. groenlandicum psi remained at pretreatment levels. The more anisohydric behavior of L. laricina and C. calyculata may provide greater net C uptake with warming, while the more conservative P. mariana and R. groenlandicum maintained greater hydraulic safety. These latter species also responded to elevated CO2 by reduced psi stress, which may also help limit hydraulic failure during periods of extreme drought or heat in the future. Along with Sphagnum moss, the species-specific responses of peatland vascular communities to drier or hotter conditions will shape boreal peatland composition and function in the future.

AB Climatological measurements, including carbon dioxide flux density, were made from April to September in 1994 and from April to November in 1996 at a fen wetland near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada, as part df the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). For both years, the study period was warmer and drier than the 24-year climate normals. The period of CO2 uptake was similar for both years, reaching maximum measured assimilation rates of -0.55 mg m(-2) s(-1) in midsummer. However, warmer air temperatures and an earlier snowmelt in the spring of 1994, which led to an earlier thaw for the fen surface, and warmer and drier conditions in the fall of 1994 promoted CO2 production at times when the vascular vegetation was not photosynthesizing. As a result, in 1994 over the study period of 124 days the fen was a net source of CO2-carbon to the atmosphere, losing 30.8 g C m(-2); for the same period in 1996 the fen was a net sink of CO2-carbon, assimilating -91.6 g C m(-2). Given the immense store of carbon in boreal peatlands and given a growing understanding of the relative importance of the soil carbon pool to net ecosystem exchange and of the sensitivity of this carbon storage to temperature and wetness, this boreal fen's response to earlier spring warming and drier conditions extends our understanding of the impact of climate change on the carbon balance for northern ecosystems.

AB Climate change will influence plant photosynthesis by altering patterns of temperature and precipitation, including their variability and seasonality. Both effects may be important for peatlands as the carbon (C) sink potential of these ecosystems depends on the balance between plant C uptake through photosynthesis and microbial decomposition. Here, we show that the effect of climate warming on Sphagnum community photosynthesis toggles from positive to negative as the peatland goes from rainy to dry periods during summer. More particularly, we show that mechanisms of compensation among the dominant Sphagnum species (Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum medium) stabilize the average photosynthesis and productivity of the Sphagnum community during summer despite rising temperatures and frequent droughts. While warming had a negligible effect on S. medium photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) during rainy periods, A(max) of S. fallax increased by 40%. On the opposite, warming exacerbated the negative effects of droughts on S. fallax with an even sharper decrease of its A(max) while S. medium A(max) remained unchanged. S. medium showed a remarkable resistance to droughts due to anatomical traits favouring its water holding capacity. Our results show that different phenotypic plasticity among dominant Sphagnum species allow the community to cope with rising temperatures and repeated droughts, maintaining similar photosynthesis and productivity over summer in warmed and control conditions. These results are important because they provide information on how soil water content may modulate the effects of climate warming on Sphagnum productivity in boreal peatlands. It further confirms the transitory nature of warming-induced photosynthesis benefits in boreal systems and highlights the vulnerability of the ecosystem to excess warming and drying.

TI Climate-driven expansion of blanket bogs in Britain during the Holocene
SO CLIMATE OF THE PAST

   RADIOCARBON; IMPACT; SITE
AB Blanket bog occupies approximately 6% of the area of the UK today. The Holocene expansion of this hyperoceanic biome has previously been explained as a consequence of Neolithic forest clearance. However, the present distribution of blanket bog in Great Britain can be predicted accurately with a simple model (PeatStash) based on summer temperature and moisture index thresholds, and the same model correctly predicts the highly disjunct distribution of blanket bog worldwide. This finding suggests that climate, rather than land-use history, controls blanket-bog distribution in the UK and everywhere else.
   We set out to test this hypothesis for blanket bogs in the UK using bioclimate envelope modelling compared with a database of peat initiation age estimates. We used both pollen-based reconstructions and climate model simulations of climate changes between the mid-Holocene (6000 yr BP, 6 ka) and modern climate to drive PeatStash and predict areas of blanket bog. We compiled data on the timing of blanket-bog initiation, based on 228 age determinations at sites where peat directly overlies mineral soil. The model predicts that large areas of northern Britain would have had blanket bog by 6000 yr BP, and the area suitable for peat growth extended to the south after this time. A similar pattern is shown by the basal peat ages and new blanket bog appeared over a larger area during the late Holocene, the greatest expansion being in Ireland, Wales, and southwest England, as the model predicts. The expansion was driven by a summer cooling of about 2 degrees C, shown by both pollen-based reconstructions and climate models. The data show early Holocene (preNeolithic) blanket-bog initiation at over half of the sites in the core areas of Scotland and northern England.
   The temporal patterns and concurrence of the bioclimate model predictions and initiation data suggest that climate change provides a parsimonious explanation for the early Holocene distribution and later expansion of blanket bogs in the UK, and it is not necessary to invoke anthropogenic activity as a driver of this major landscape change.

AB Hydrogeologic setting strongly influences the hydrologic function of peatland systems. For base-rich fens in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of the Western Boreal Plain, northern Alberta, local groundwater flow from gently sloping adjacent uplands has been shown to help sustain fen water tables and chemistry. Natural forest disturbance in the AOSR is dominated by wildfire, with peatlands susceptible to combustion and subsequent carbon release. However, few studies have aimed to characterize the degree of change to the hydrophysical properties of upland soils following wildfire. To address this, we measured differences in water repellency and hydrophysical properties of burned and unburned upland organic and mineral soils in a burned moderate-rich fen watershed (Poplar Fen), similar to 25 km north of Fort McMurray. Samples were taken in the fall of 2017, similar to 1.5 years after the watershed burned (May 2016). Study locations included burned and unburned jack pine-dominated upland and black spruce-dominated riparian areas. Results illustrated significantly lower water repellency and higher infiltration on burned locations of both land types. Furthermore, no significant differences were detected in organic soil moisture retention in uplands; however, burned organic soil samples had significantly lower water retention in riparian areas. We postulate the lower water retention in riparian areas was due to the greater organic layer thickness there, thus greater fuel load and potential for exceeding the temperature threshold of repellency destruction. Following retention, all soil cores exhibited high hysteresis, with differences in volumetric moisture content averaging 0.38 and 0.34 m(3) m(-3) at -10 cm pressure for upland and riparian locations, respectively. Our results are contrary to the increased hydrophobicity following burning that is commonly reported in boreal regions. The promoted infiltration, groundwater recharge and subsequent enhanced water supply to fens in the local groundwater system may help in accelerating the moss recovery process.

AB Compared to other temporary aquatic ecosystems, we know relatively little about how inundation frequency and duration (i.e. hydrologic regime) influences the structure of aquatic communities in northern peatlands. In this study, we examined patterns in nutrient availability and aquatic community structure during a natural flooding event in an Alaskan fen where water-table position had been manipulated in three large-scale experimental plots during previous years to simulate both drought (lowered water-table treatment) and flooding (raised water-table treatment) conditions relative to a control without manipulation. Although the natural flood disrupted the long-term experimental manipulation, it provided an opportunity to evaluate how variation in past hydrologic regime influences nutrient dynamics and aquatic food web structure during periods of inundation in a northern boreal peatland. Despite similar water depth among experimental plots during the time of sampling (i.e. water was above the peat surface in all plots), water-column nutrient concentrations were significantly greater in the drought treatment (where water table had been lowered during the previous growing season) compared to the raised water-table treatment and the control. Algal production increased with enhanced nutrient availability across all water-table treatments and was most elevated following the rewetting of dry sediments in the drought treatment. Consumer biomass (heterotrophic bacteria and macroinvertebrates) increased with algal production and was significantly greater in the drought treatment compared to the raised water-table treatment and the control. Consumer biomass decreased into the second year of constant inundation as algal production was constrained by reduced nutrient availability. Stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) showed that elevated levels of periphyton (i.e. the intact biofilm) associated with enhanced nutrient availability promoted energy transfer to higher trophic levels (grazers and predators) rather than living or dead mosses or vascular plant material. Consumption of algal material by grazers altered the size and composition of the algal community. The algal community shifted from coccoid (edible) to filamentous (inedible) growth forms with increased grazer abundance in the drought treatment, possibly owing to selective grazing. Conversely, there was a similar proportion of edible and inedible taxa in the control and raised treatments where grazers were lower in abundance. Our results show that the legacy effects of drought can regulate aquatic community structure in northern peatlands. Within a predictive context, our findings suggest that conditions of more variable hydrology expected with climate change (i.e. increased frequency of drought) occurring across northern latitudes will promote energy flow to higher trophic levels by releasing nutrient constraints on microalgae during periods of inundation.

AB The response of plant growth to rising CO2 levels appears to depend on nutrient availability, but it is not known whether the growth of bog plants reacts similarly. We therefore studied the effects of elevated CO2 in combination with N supply on the growth of Sphagnum mosses and vascular plants in ombrotrophic bog vegetation. Because the growth of Sphagnum is less nutrient-limited than that of vascular plants, we hypothesized that Sphagnum would benefit from elevated CO2. In our greenhouse experiment, peat monoliths (34 cm diameter, 40 cm deep) with intact bog vegetation were exposed to ambient (350 ppmv) or elevated (560 ppmv) atmospheric CO2 combined with low (no N addition) or high (5 g N m(-2) yr(-1) added) N deposition for two growing seasons. Elevated atmospheric CO2 had unexpected deleterious effects on the growth of Sphagnum magellanicum, the dominant Sphagnum species. Growth was greatly reduced, particularly in the second growing season when, regardless of N supply, the mosses looked unhealthy. The negative CO2 effect was strongest in the warmest months, suggesting a combined effect of elevated CO2 and the raised temperatures in the greenhouse. High N deposition favored Rhynchospora alba, which became the dominant vascular plant species during the experiment. Biomass increased more when N supply was high. There were no significant effects of elevated CO2 on vascular plants, although elevated CO2 combined with high N supply tended to increase the aboveground vascular plant biomass. As Sphagnum is the main carbon-sequestrating species in bogs and rising atmospheric CO2 levels are likely to be followed by increases in temperature, there is an urgent need for further research on the combined effects of elevated CO2 and increased temperature on Sphagnum growth in bog ecosystems.

AB Studies conducted across northern Europe and North America have shown increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic systems in recent decades. While there is little consensus as to the exact mechanisms for the increases in DOC, hypotheses converge on such climate change factors as warming, increased precipitation variability, and changes in atmospheric deposition. In this study, we tested the effects of warming on peat porewater composition by actively warming a peatland with infrared lamps mounted 1.24 m above the peat surface for 3 years. Mean growing season peat temperatures in the warmed plots (n = 5) were 1.9 +/- A 0.4 A degrees C warmer than the control plots at 5 cm depth (t statistic = 5.03, p = 0.007). Mean porewater DOC concentrations measured throughout the growing season were 15 % higher in the warmed plots (73.4 +/- A 3.2 mg L-1) than in the control plots (63.7 +/- A 2.1 mg L-1) at 25 cm (t = 4.69, p < 0.001). Furthermore, DOC from the warmed plots decayed nearly twice as fast as control plot DOC in laboratory incubations, and exhibited lower aromaticity than control plot porewater (reduction in SUVA(254) in heated plots compared with control plots). Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations tracked DOC patterns as expected, but the amount of dissolved N per unit C decreased with warming. Previous work has shown that warming increased net primary production at this site, and together with measured increases in the activities of chitinases and glucosidases we suggest that the increased DOC concentrations observed with warming were derived in part from microbial-plant interactions in the rhizosphere. We also detected more nitrogen containing compounds with higher double bond equivalents (DBE) unique to the warmed plots, within the pool of biomolecules able to deprotonate (16 % of all compounds identified using ultrahigh resolution ion electrospray mass spectrometry); we suggest these compounds could be the products of increased plant, microbial, and enzyme activity occurring with warming. With continued warming in peatlands, an increase in relatively labile DOC concentrations could contribute to dissolved exports of DOC in runoff, and would likely contribute to the pool of efficient electron donors (and acceptors) in the production of CO2 and CH4 in terrestrial and aquatic environments.

AB Testate amoebae contribute significantly to belowground ecological processes like nutrient cycling, but a decline in their nutrient cycling functions in peatlands is expected due to global climate warming. We studied the dynamics of testate amoebae communities in relation to soil environmental variables in a permafrost peatland that experienced in situ experimental warming for a 7-yr period. Experimental warming reduced testate amoebae biomass by 41%. Redundancy analyses showed that testate amoebae community structure was correlated with water table depth and soil temperature (these explained 10% of the variance in community structure) and dissolved organic carbon (which explained 2.2% of the variance). Our results demonstrated that warming-induced changes to the water table depth affected the testate amoebae community in peatland, which could have consequences for the stability of the microbial food web and carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems.

AB The mid-high latitude permafrost peatlands in the Northern Hemisphere is a major natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Ecosystem scale CH4 emissions from a typical permafrost peatland in the Great Hing'an Mountains were observed during the growing season of 2014 and 2015 using the open-path eddy covariance method. Relevant environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation were also collected. There was a clear diurnal variation in methane emissions in the second half of each growing season, with significantly higher emission rates in the wet sector of study area. The daily CH4 exchange ranged from 1.8 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) to 40.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d-1 in 2014 and ranged from 3.9 to 15.0 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in 2015. There were no peaks of CH4 fluxes during the spring thawing period. However; large peaks of CH4 emission were found in the second half of both growing seasons. The CH4 emission after Jul 25(th) accounted for 77.9% of total growing season emission in 2014 and 85.9% in 2015. The total CH4 emission during the growing season of 2014 and 2015 was approximately 1.52 g CH4 m(-2) and 0.71 g CH4 m-2, respectively. CH4 fluxes during the growing seasons were significantly correlated with thawing depth (R-2 = 0.71, P < 0.01,) and soil temperatures (R-2 = 0.75, P < 0.01) at 40 cm depth. An empirical equation using these two major variables was modified to estimate growing season CH4 emissions in permafrost peatlands. Our multiyear observations indicate that the time-lagged volume of precipitation during the growing season is a key factor in interpreting locally inter-annual variations in CH4 emissions. Our results suggested that the low temperature in the deep soil layers effectively restricts methane production and emission rates; these conditions may create significant positive feedback under global climate change.

AB Peat molecular chemistry reflects a combination of plant input and decomposition. Both vegetation community and the degree of decomposition of plant remains are highly dependent on depth and fluctuation of the water table and thus peat organic matter (OM) chemistry reflects past hydrological conditions. Changes in hydrology according to the OM composition (by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, pyrolysis-GC/MS) in a high-resolution sampled monolith of an 8000 years old peat deposit are presented. Analysis of 18 modern vegetation species resulted in molecular markers for Erica spp., Deschampsia flexuosa, Juncus bulbosus and Carex binervis, in addition to more general markers which enabled differentiation between woody, grass and moss vegetation. Factor analysis of 106 pyrolysis products quantified for all peat samples enabled identification of mineral (Factor 1) and hydrological (Factor 2) conditions of the bog. Depth profiles of vegetation markers showed good agreement with those of the scores of both factors and enabled the identification of 14 relatively wet periods, dating to 1430-1865 AD, 930-1045 AD, 640 AD, 270-385 AD, 190-215 AD, 135 AD, 45 BC-15 AD, 260-140 BC, 640-440 BC, 1055-960 BC, 1505-1260 BC, 2300 BC, 41902945 BC and 5700-5205 BC, which show excellent agreement with other palaeoclimatic studies in Europe. The results emphasize the importance of high-resolution sampling, in combination with the use of multiple vegetation markers and other peat OM characteristics for a proper interpretation of a peat record.

   raised bog; water table
ID DECOMPOSITION
AB Trees of Pinus rotundata (bog pine) characterise many bogs in the mid-altitude mountains of central Europe (Switzerland, East and South Germany, Czech Republic). The research described here focuses on recent changes in the growth of bog pine on the Ennersbacher Moor, a mountain mire in the Black Forest (south-west Germany). An increase in the cover of bog pine is usually caused by drainage and subsequent drawdown of the water table. However, this bog has not been drained or directly disturbed in any other way. One possible explanation is that a road constructed in 1983 along one margin of the bog has diverted part of its water supply. Even though the road was designed to conduct potentially salt-contaminated drainage water away from the bog, its construction did not cause an immediate vegetation response in the 1980s and 1990s. Therefore, I hypothesise that it enhanced the sensitivity of the bog to climatic stress, predisposing it to a succession that was eventually triggered by a series of drought years in 2009-2011. Data collected near the centre of the bog over the period 1998-2014 indicate not only a distinct change in the relationship between height and trunk circumference of the trees, but also an increase of dwarf shrub cover and changes in the composition of Sphagnum communities. Although the pH of near-surface water may have increased slightly over this period, pH and EC values remain within typical ranges for raised bogs in the Black Forest. Examination of peat profiles reveals that the peat is more highly humified now than it was in 2002, and water table records from 2012-2014 show a greater amplitude of fluctuation than water table data collected in 1998-2001. Even though its mean level is only 105 mm below the ground surface, the water table is now observed to fall rapidly to depths of at least 350 mm during both wet and dry summers. Mapping surface (meso) topography and flow lines from the adjacent slope shows that the Ennersbacher Moor is not domed in this direction, so that water arriving from upslope would reach the bog centre if the road were not present. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that the observed succession is a delayed effect of construction of the road.

AB Northern peatlands contain a large terrestrial carbon pool that plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle. A considerable fraction of this carbon pool is currently in permafrost and is biogeochemically relatively inert; this will change with increasing soil temperatures as a result of climate warming in the 21st century. We use a geospatially explicit representation of peat areas and peat depth from a recently-compiled database and a geothermal model to estimate northern North America soil temperature responses to predicted changes in air temperature. We find that, despite a widespread decline in the areas classified as permafrost, soil temperatures in peatlands respond more slowly to increases in air temperature owing to the insulating properties of peat. We estimate that an additional 670 km(3) of peat soils in North America, containing similar to 33 Pg C, could be seasonally thawed by the end of the century, representing similar to 20% of the total peat volume in Alaska and Canada. Warming conditions result in a lengthening of the soil thaw period by similar to 40 days, averaged over the model domain. These changes have potentially important implications for the carbon balance of peat soils.

AB At high latitudes, winter climate change alters snow cover and, consequently, may cause a sustained change in soil frost dynamics. Altered winter soil conditions could influence the ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) and, in turn, provide feedbacks to ongoing climate change. To investigate the mechanisms that modify the peatland CO2 exchange in response to altered winter soil frost, we conducted a snow exclusion experiment to enhance winter soil frost and to evaluate its short-term (1-3 years) and long-term (11 years) effects on CO2 fluxes during subsequent growing seasons in a boreal peatland. In the first 3 years after initiating the treatment, no significant effects were observed on either gross primary production (GPP) or ecosystem respiration (ER). However, after 11 years, the temperature sensitivity of ER was reduced in the treatment plots relative to the control, resulting in an overall lower ER in the former. Furthermore, early growing season GPP was also lower in the treatment plots than in the controls during periods with photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) >= 800 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), corresponding to lower sedge leaf biomass in the treatment plots during the same period. During the peak growing season, a higher GPP was observed in the treatment plots under the low light condition (i.e. PPFD 400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) compared to the control. As Sphagnum moss maximizes photosynthesis at low light levels, this GPP difference between the plots may have been due to greater moss photosynthesis, as indicated by greater moss biomass production, in the treatment plots relative to the controls. Our study highlights the different responses to enhanced winter soil frost among plant functional types which regulate CO2 fluxes, suggesting that winter climate change could considerably alter the growing season CO2 exchange in boreal peatlands through its effect on vegetation development.

AB Microbial enzyme activities were followed during a field-based experimental simulation of the effects of higher rainfall in a Welsh peat land. The treatment did not significantly affect the activities of the carbon cycling enzymes, P-glucosidase, esterase or xylosidase. In contrast, the activity of the enzyme sulphatase decreased by 44% (P < 0.001) in response to the wetter conditions. The manipulation suggests that should climate change cause conditions to become wetter in peatlands, then (with the exception of sulphatase) current levels of wetness may be sufficient to limit decomposition processes, and thus any further increase in wetness is unlikely to induce a further decrease in decomposition rates. Correlations were found between the esterase activity and both nitrous oxide flux (r=-0.34, P<0.05), and methane release (r=0.53, P<0.01). Likewise, there was a correlation between xylosidase activity and both carbon dioxide emission (r=0.52, P<0.01) and aluminium concentration (r=0.58, P<0.01). All of the enzymes correlated positively with dissolved organic carbon (range r=0.53, P<0.01 sulphatase to r=0.61, P<0.001 glucosidase). Together, the correlations lend support to recent hypotheses suggesting that enzymes exert an influence over wetland biogeochemical properties.

AB The blocking of drainage ditches in peat has been proposed as a possible mitigation strategy for the widely observed increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations from northern peatlands. This study tested the hypothesis that drain-blocking could lead to lower DOC concentrations by measuring the DOC export from a series of small peat-covered catchments over a period of 2 years. Six catchments were chosen: two were pristine that had never been drained; three where drains had been blocked (one in 1995, and two in 2003); and a control peat drain catchment where the drain was left unblocked throughout the study. In the case where drains were blocked as part of thus Study, the drains were observed for 2 months before blocking and 2 years after blocking. The results show that: (i) high concentrations of DOC can come from water ponded in the drain; (ii) the DOC export (flux of DOC per area of catchment) from the six study catchments shows a high degree of positive correlation with both catchment size and water yield; (iii) distinctly lower DOC export with water yield was observed for the catchments containing higher-order channels (> 27500 m(2)) as opposed to single drain catchments (> 7500 m(2)); (iv) drain-blocking resulted in a statistically significant decrease in DOC export (average was 39%) but the effect upon DOC concentration explained only 1% of the variance in the data. The results suggest that drain blocking works by decreasing the flow from the drain, not by changing the production of DOC in the peat. The change in export with catchment size implies a considerable removal of DOC from large catchments. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The climate conditions of the current and previous growing seasons have been shown to influence growth of coniferous trees in mineral soils sites. These dependencies may be different in peatlands where growth is generally more dependent on variations in soil water conditions. In the Nordic and Baltic countries, millions of hectares of peatlands and wetlands have been drained in order to enhance forest production. These drainage networks do not guarantee stable soil water conditions for the whole stand rotation. It is thus likely that precipitation in particular may have a different influence on annual growth in peatland to that in mineral soil sites. We studied the effect of precipitation and temperature on the inter-annual diameter growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Finland in drained peatland forests. The diameter growth data were limited to periods when growth response to drainage had levelled out. For comparison. growth data were also collected from adjacent mineral soil trees. The climate variables were monthly mean temperature and precipitation in a given location estimated from observations at the nearest weather stations by means of spatial smoothing. We used mixed linear models in describing the annual diameter growth of individual trees as a function of tree size and stand properties and expressed the residual variation as a function of climate parameters. The peatland and mineral soil growth variations showed different dependence on climate parameters. Peatland trees within 5 m of a ditch showed different climate responses compared to those located further away. Precipitation in July was negatively correlated with the diameter growth of peatland trees but there was no correlation with temperature. Growth of trees in mineral soils was positively correlated with March and April mean temperatures and May and June mean precipitation. The residual growth indices showed largely similar patterns in peatlands and mineral soil sites. (C) 2012 Istituto Italiano di Dendrocronologia. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an empirical model of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) developed for a subarctic fen near Churchill, Manitoba. The model with observed data helps explain the interannual variability in growing season NEE. Five years of tower-flux data are used to test and examine the seasonal behaviour of the model simulations. Processes controlling the observed interannual variability of CO2 exchange at the fen are examined by exploring the sensitivity of the model to changes in air temperature, precipitation and leaf area index. Results indicate that the sensitivity of NEE to changing environmental controls is complex and varies interannually depending on the initial conditions of the wetland. Changes in air temperature and the timing of precipitation events have a strong influence on NEE, which is largely manifest in gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP). Climate change scenarios indicate that warmer air temperatures will increase carbon acquisition during wet years but may act to reduce wetland carbon storage in years that experience a large water deficit early in the growing season. Model simulations for this subarctic sedge fen indicate that carbon acquisition is greatest during wet and warm conditions. This suggests therefore that carbon accumulation was greatest at this subarctic fen during its early developmental stages when hydroclimatic conditions were relatively wet and warm at approximately 2500 years before present.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from managed peatlands have not been extensively studied in Western Patagonia. The objective of this study was to assess the annual CO2 emission from microbial carbon (C) mineralization in a peatland site under not saturated conditions at Tierra del Fuego. The annual CO2 emissions were measured from unsaturated soil samples (n = 41) under soil incubation at seasonal local temperatures to simulate CO2 emissions for a year, using a non-dispersive infrared gas analyser. Spatial models for total soil C and CO2 were calculated using discrete and continuous variables. The annual mean of measured cumulative CO2 was 1,358 mu g CO2 g soil(-1), lower than Northern peatlands, and 82% of the C mineralization occurred in the warmer season. The modelled CO2 in the warmer season showed levels of CO2 as high as 4 mg CO2 g soil(-1), but 66% of the area showed between 600-2000 mu g CO2 g soil(-1), which is 28%-92% and 9%-32% of CO2 values reported for crop rotations. Consequently, after a potential habilitation of the study area for agricultural use, the soil CO2 emissions from heterotrophic activity would become a C source to the global CO2 emissions. This ecosystem is highly exposed to the effects of the land-use change, and global temperature increase.

AB The peatlands of northern latitudes represent an enormous store of organic carbon. The decomposition of peat and the release of carbon dioxide is expected to increase with temperature as a result of climate change. CO2 emission and O-2 uptake were measured during laboratory incubations of homogenised peat samples from 15 sites in Scotland. These were made either at fixed temperatures or in experiments where the temperature was steadily raised and lowered in 2 degrees C steps, enabling Arrhenius plots to be made and the temperature response to be quantified as an activation energy or as a Q(10) The respiratory quotient varied with temperature and this led to higher Q(10) values for O-2 uptake than for CO2 emission. Feats varied widely in their response to temperature; Q(10) values were between 2.2 and 19 with a mean of 4.8. For most peats the response was approximately constant over the range of temperature tested but a third of the peats showed a marked deviation over the range 1-5 degrees C where Q(10) values increased considerably. Several published models describing the change in temperature response with temperature were applied to the data. A function in which the log of;the soil respiration rate is a quadratic in temperature gave the best coverall fit. Based on the observed laboratory Q(10) values, a rise in mean annual temperature of 5 degrees C could potentially increase CO2 emissions by a factor of 2- to 4-fold. For some peats at low temperatures (0-5 degrees C) small changes in temperature could have a much more marked effect. This may be significant for the peatlands in Scotland and similar latitudes where soil temperatures are commonly within this range and where predicted temperature increases over the next 50 years may bring about a significant increase in peat decomposition rates.

AB Losses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from drained peatlands are of concern, due to the effects this has on the delivery of ecosystem services, and especially on the long-term store of carbon and the provision of drinking water. Most studies have looked at the effect of drainage in deep peat; comparatively, little is known about the behaviour of shallow, climatically marginal peatlands. This study examines water quality (DOC, Abs(400), pH, E4/E6 and C/C) during rainfall events from such environments in the south west UK, in order to both quantify DOC losses, and understand their potential for restoration. Water samples were taken over a 19 month period from a range of drains within two different experimental catchments in Exmoor National Park; data were analysed on an event basis. DOC concentrations ranging between 4 and 21 mg L-1 are substantially lower than measurements in deep peat, but remain problematic for the water treatment process. Dryness plays a critical role in controlling DOC concentrations and water quality, as observed through spatial and seasonal differences. Long-term changes in depth to water table (30 days before the event) are likely to impact on DOC production, whereas discharge becomes the main control over DOC transport at the time scale of the rainfall/runoff event. The role of temperature during events is attributed to an increase in the diffusion of DOC, and therefore its transport Humification ratios (E4/E6) consistently below 5 indicate a predominance of complex humic acids, but increased decomposition during warmer summer months leads to a comparatively higher losses of fulvic acids. This work represents a significant contribution to the scientific understanding of the behaviour and functioning of shallow damaged peatlands in climatically marginal locations. The findings also provide a sound baseline knowledge to support research into the effects of landscape restoration in the future. Crown Copyright (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier S.V.

AB The quantification of greenhouse gas sources and sinks is important to understanding the impact of climate change. Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas, which, on a global scale, is released largely as a product of anaerobic microbial decomposition and predominantly from wetlands. A zone of intense CH4 production just below the water table is thought to contribute significantly to the overall flux from peat bogs. We describe the use of membrane inlet quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) to confirm the existence of bubbles, their gaseous concentrations and their localization at a fine spatial resolution within intact peat cores. We use the distribution of the noble gas argon (Ar) and the distinct QMS responses to dissolved and gaseous (bubble) phases to identify trapped bubbles with a resolution of 0.6 mm. Bubbles with CH4 concentrations of up to 20 kPa were widely distributed in the upper 300 mm of the cores with similar to 11% of all profiles comprising bubbles. The dissolved concentrations responsible for the bubbles were on average 83 +/- 80 mu M, indicating lower concentrations relative to other QMS studies. We suggest that if the distinction between dissolved and gaseous phases is not made in studies of CH4 within peat profiles then the prominence of bubbles is likely to result in overestimates of dissolved CH4 concentrations. Fluxes of CH4 from peat as a result of drawdown or other perturbation are likely to be large, rapid and short lived because of bubble burst, and also larger than from peat without bubbles. We suggest that the dynamics of fluxes need to be modelled taking into account both gaseous and dissolved phases. Estimates of potential fluxes that assume CH4 is dissolved are likely to overestimate fluxes if the gaseous phase has not been taken into account.

AB Northern peatlands constitute an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle due to their long-term accumulation of soil organic matter. This function as a carbon sink is partly dependent on low temperatures limiting decomposition and nutrient cycling, so global warming has the potential to alter the C balance of these systems and feedback to climate change. Field observations have shown that peatland organic matter decomposition, ecosystem respiration and nitrogen cycling are closely related processes that show a large degree of temperature sensitivity. In the current study, we investigated whether seasonal dynamics of substrate input may be an indirect mechanism accounting for this observed sensitivity. We carried out a 60-day mesocosm incubation experiment with sub-arctic peat soil to compare the direct effects of temperature increase with the indirect effects of increased microbial- or plant-derived organic matter input on key soil C and N cycling processes and substrate pools. Additions of dead microbial cells led to an 83% increase in organic N pool sizes, 16-64% increases in the potential activities of most soil enzymes, a transient increase in the relative abundance of beta-proteobacteria, and a decrease in the relative abundance of alpha-proteo-, Actino- and Acido-bacteria. Neither the addition of plant root litter, nor a 5 degrees C alteration in incubation temperatures, had comparable effects on these parameters. Peat respiration was positively affected by both substrate addition (20-46% increase) and higher incubation temperatures (34-38% increase), but the temperature-only effect was not sufficient to account for the increases in respiration observed in field experiments. Thus, it appears that warming effects on C and N cycle processes can potentially be driven by indirect effects, with alterations to the seasonal flux of microbe-derived organic matter a particularly potent mechanism. The high temperature sensitivity of decomposition and respiration may therefore be largely a result of warming-induced changes in substrate supply rates. We propose that climate change models of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling should seek to incorporate realistic microbial biomass dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland ecosystem processes are strongly influenced by hydrology linked to climate change. However, how transpiration, as major water loss pathway in closed peatland, responds to climate change and then regulates ecosystem water balance that remains poorly understood. Here, we reported an 18,000-year fossil phytolith record from an herbaceous community-dominated mountain peatland in central China to reconstruct climate changes and vegetation evolution and reveal the interactions between regional climate changes and peatland ecosystem. The abundance of bulliform phytoliths-a silicified type of cells that regulate the movements of plant leaves to reduce light exposure and transpiration rate-shows close correlations with the Holocene climate variations with higher bulliform abundance in response to warm-dry climate (11,500-9600 cal yr BP; 7500-3000 cal yr BP) and lower values associated with cold-wet climate (13,000-11,500 cal yr BP; 3000 cal yr BP-present). Spectral analysis reveals that bulliform abundance and reconstructed climate vary with a major similar to 1000-year periodicity during the Holocene, suggesting a possible causal relationship to solar activity. A high bulliform abundance and warm-dry climate correspond with enhanced solar activity, and vice versa. We interpret that the resultant leaf water deficit resulted from greater light interception, high temperature and drought promoted the production of bulliform cells to fold leaf for water conservation, which is an effective protective mechanism of peatland grasses from the environmental stress. These results expand our understanding of how grass-dominated peatland plant water regulation recorded by bulliform phytoliths responds to solar radiation and local hydroclimate during geological period.

AB Soil microbes and enzymes in permafrost peatland are sensitive to temperature changes, which might result in more potential loss of carbon and increase in available nitrogen from permafrost peatlands in a warming world. We previously demonstrated that 3-year warming could affect soil microbial abundance and enzymatic activity. However, soil microbial abundance and enzymatic activity in permafrost peatlands under long-term climate warming is not well understood. Therefore, a 6-year field manipulation experiment was used to assess the impact of long-term warming on soil microbial abundance and enzymatic activity in a permafrost peatland in northeastern China. Results showed that 6-year warming increased the abundance of bacteria in 0 to 15 cm soil under tussock and from shrub rhizosphere, fungi from shrub non-rhizosphere, and archaea under tussock and from the rhizosphere of shrub. These increased microbial abundances could stimulate soil carbon cycling and accelerate soil carbon loss in permafrost peatland under warming. Six-year warming increased methanogen abundance in 0 to 15 cm soil and methanotroph abundance in 15 to 30 cm soil under tussock, indicating that warming could enhance CH4 cycling. Soil nirS-denitrifier abundance from the 0 to 15 cm shrub rhizosphere increased under warming, thereby suggesting that warming stimulated denitrification and N2O emission. ?-Glucosidase activity in 0 to 15 cm soil under tussock and from shrub rhizosphere increased, but invertase activity in 15 to 30 cm soil under tussock and from shrub rhizosphere showed opposite tendency under warming. DOC content tended to increase in the 0 to 15 cm rhizosphere soil, but decreased in shrub non-rhizosphere soil. Warming increased NH4+?N content in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil. Positive correlations between abundances of bacteria, archaea, contents of DOC, and NH4+?N in 0 to 15 cm soil suggest that increases in bacterial and archaeal abundance could indicate higher carbon and nitrogen availability in topsoil of permafrost peatlands under warming. The results offer new insights into the response of plant?soil-microbe interactions in permafrost peatlands to climate change.

AB The net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) drives the carbon (C) sink-source strength of northern peatlands. Since NEE represents a balance between various production and respiration fluxes, accurate predictions of its response to global changes require an in depth understanding of these underlying processes. Currently, however, detailed information of the temporal dynamics as well as the separate biotic and abiotic controls of the NEE component fluxes is lacking in peatland ecosystems. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using an automated chamber system established across natural and trenching/vegetation removal plots to partition NEE into its production (i.e., gross and net primary production; GPP and NPP) and respiration (i.e., ecosystem, heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration; ER, Rh and Ra) fluxes in a boreal peatland in northern Sweden. Our results showed that daily NEE patterns were driven by GPP while variations in ER were governed by Ra rather than Rh. Moreover, we observed pronounced seasonal shifts in the Ra/Rh and above/belowground NPP ratios throughout the main phenological phases. Generalized linear model analysis revealed that the greenness index derived from digital images (as a proxy for plant phenology) was the strongest control of NEE, GPP and NPP while explaining considerable fractions also in the variations of ER and Ra. In addition, our data exposed greater temperature sensitivity of NPP compared to Rh resulting in enhanced C sequestration with increasing temperature. Overall, our study suggests that the temporal patterns in NEE and its component fluxes are tightly coupled to vegetation dynamics in boreal peatlands and thus challenges previous studies that commonly identify abiotic factors as key drivers. These findings further emphasize the need for integrating detailed information on plant phenology into process-based models to improve predictions of global change impacts on the peatland C cycle.

AB Drained thermokarst lake basins cover large areas of northern high latitude lowlands. However, the importance of peat accumulated in these drained basins to carbon (C) cycling is poorly understood. Results are presented here from a permafrost sediment core aimed at investigating site history, lake drainage, apparent carbon accumulation, and paleohydrology in a thermokarst basin on the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta in southwestern Alaska. The results show that a thermokarst lake existed for about 2300 years before it drained and a peatland established in the early 1600s. Average apparent C accumulation rate (CAR) was 12 gC/m(2)/yr over the 2300 years before lake drainage, but increased to 120 gC/m(2)/yr following peatland initiation. After transitioning to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland at similar to 1700 AD, CAR reduced gradually before more than doubling from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. This abrupt increase in CAR was possibly in response to a Pacific climate regime shift in the late 1970s, a transition characterized by a nearly 1.5 degrees C increase in regional average annual temperature. Even after considering the differential decay of recent peat, there was an increase in C accumulation after 1977. Reconstructed water-table depths from subfossil testate amoebae show little change throughout the past three centuries, but there was a pronounced shift in testate amoeba composition after the 1977 temperature change (e.g., absence of Phryganella acropodia type and increase in Hyalosphenia elegans). If the results from peatlands in other drained thermokarst lake basins are consistent with the results from this study, then the C accumulated in these vegetated drained basins under current warming might help offset some of the C released from thawing permafrost and thermokarst features in northern regions.

TI Spatial variation of hydroclimate in north-eastern North America during

AB Climatic expressions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) vary regionally, with reconstructions often depicting complex spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation change. The characterisation of these spatial patterns helps advance understanding of hydroclimate variability and associated responses of human and natural systems to climate change. Many regions, including north-eastern North America, still lack well-resolved records of past hydrological change. Here, we reconstruct hydroclimatic change over the past millennium using testate amoeba-inferred peatland water table depth reconstructions obtained from fifteen peatlands across Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Quebec. Spatial comparisons of reconstructed water table depths reveal complex hydroclimatic patterns that varied over the last millennium. The records suggest a spatially divergent pattern across the region during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. Southern peatlands were wetter during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, whilst northern and more continental sites were drier. There is no evidence at the multi-decadal sampling resolution of this study to indicate that Medieval mega-droughts recorded in the west and continental interior of North America extended to these peatlands in the north-east of the continent. Reconstructed Little Ice Age hydroclimate change was spatially variable rather than displaying a clear directional shift or latitudinal trends, which may relate to local temporary permafrost aggradation in northern sites, and reconstructed characteristics of some dry periods during the Little Ice Age are comparable with those reconstructed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. The spatial hydroclimatic trends identified here suggest that over the last millennium, peatland moisture balance in north-eastern North America has been influenced by changes in the Polar Jet Stream, storm activities and sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic as well as internal peatland dynamics.

AB Wetland restoration management is an important tool for stakeholders and practitioners to mitigate climate change and preserve ecological functioning. Various approaches to modifying the water management of a catchment for restoration purposes exist and were performed in a preservation area in northwest Germany. To validate the effect of the re-wetting practice, a monitoring network of 46 wells was established and monthly readings were taken from 1997 onwards. A declining trend in water table depth was present at 39 wells and equaled on average a lowering of 20 cm during the study period from 1997 to 2012. So far, half of the trend lines are above 40 cm below ground, which is an indicator of an effective re-wetting practice, but they will decline below this threshold until 2032 according to linear regression analysis. The progress of water table depths might be accelerated by climate change. According to the meteorological forecast, air temperatures will rise and the annual precipitation pattern will change. Thus, the climatic water balance tends toward more negative values in the summer and positive values in the winter, favoring an earlier and more intense water table draw-down. Because root water extraction from shallow groundwater is limited to a certain depth, the forecast of water table depth development according to the recent trend depicts a worst-case scenario. Nevertheless, the results emphasize that restoration management should be validated and has to be adapted in certain ways when mitigating the impact of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mosses are the dominant plants in polar and boreal regions, areas which are experiencing rapid impacts of regional warming. Long-term monitoring programmes provide some records of the rate of recent climate change, but moss peat banks contain an unrivalled temporal record of past climate change on terrestrial plant Antarctic systems. We summarise the current understanding of climatic proxies and determinants of moss growth for contrasting continental and maritime Antarctic regions, as informed by 13C and 18O signals in organic material. Rates of moss accumulation are more than three times higher in the maritime Antarctic than continental Antarctica with growing season length being a critical determinant of growth rate, and high carbon isotope discrimination values reflecting optimal hydration conditions. Correlation plots of 13C and 18O values show that species (Chorisodontium aciphyllum / Polytrichum strictum) and growth form (hummock / bank) are the major determinants of measured isotope ratios. The interplay between moss growth form, photosynthetic physiology, water status and isotope composition are compared with developments of secondary proxies, such as chlorophyll fluorescence. These approaches provide a framework to consider the potential impact of climate change on terrestrial Antarctic habitats as well as having implications for future studies of temperate, boreal and Arctic peatlands. There are many urgent ecological and environmental problems in the Arctic related to mosses in a changing climate, but the geographical ranges of species and life-forms are difficult to track individually. Our goal was to translate what we have learned from the more simple systems in Antarctica, for application to Arctic habitats.

AB Certain general circulation models predict that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will increase the frequency of summer drought in northern wetlands due to hotter, drier summers. There is currently much uncertainty as to how drought will affect emissions of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, from wetlands. We have demonstrated that an eight centimetre drawdown of the water table in a gully mire does not significantly affect nitrous oxide emissions from this site. However, under a more extreme drought scenario carried out on peat monoliths, nitrous oxide emissions increased exponentially with a linear decrease in water table height. Drought caused a significant increase in nitrous oxide production below the water table but most of the total increase could be attributed to increased emissions above the water table. Results from an acetylene Mock experiment suggested that increased emissions were caused by increased nitrous oxide production from denitrification, rather than by increased production from nitrification. In the laboratory study, drought severity had no effect on peatwater nitrate concentrations below the water table, however, increasing drought severity decreased ammonium concentrations.

AB How methane (CH4) fluxes from alpine peatlands, especially during freeze-thaw cycles, affect the global CH4 budget is poorly understood. The present research combined the eddy covariance method, incubation experiments and high-throughput sequencing to observe CH4 flux from an alpine fen during thawing-freezing periods over a period of four years. The response of CH4 production potential and methanogenic archaea to climate change was analyzed. We found a relatively high mean annual cumulative CH4 emission of 37.7 g CH4-C m(-2). The dominant contributor to CH4 emission was the thawing period: warmer, longer thawing periods contributed 69.1-88.6% to the annual CH4 budget. Non-thawing periods also contributed, with shorter frozen-thawing periods accounting for up to 18.5% and shorter thawing-freezing periods accounting for up to 8.8%. Over the course of a year, emission peaked in the peak growing season and at onset of thawing and freezing. In contrast, emission did not vary substantially during the frozen period. Daily mean emission was highest during the thawing period and lowest during the frozen period. Diurnal patterns of CH4 emission were similar among the four periods, with peaks ranging from 12:00 to 18:00 and the lowest emission around 00:00. Water table and temperature were the dominant factors controlling CH4 emissions during different thawing-freezing periods. Our results suggest that CH4 emission from peatland will change substantially as CH4 production, microbial composition, and patterns of thawing-freezing cycles change with global warming. Therefore, frequent monitoring of CH4 fluxes in more peatlands and in situ monitoring of methanogenesis and related microbes are needed to provide a clear picture of CH4 fluxes and the thawing-freezing processes that affect them.

AB The peatland carbon store is threatened by climate change and is expected to provide positive feedback on air temperature. Most studies indicate that enhanced temperature and microbial activities result in a rise of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a consequence of higher peat decomposition. Few of them, however, have investigated the impact of in situ experimental warming on DOC response.
   We studied the response of DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), phenol oxidase, and fluorescein diacetate activities (FDA) to a 3-year in situ experimental warming using open-top chambers (OTCs) in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland.
   No significant warming of soil was recorded, implying that the simultaneous decrease in DOC and DON and the rise in FDA at the depths of 25 and 40 cm were not caused by the direct effect of OTCs on water temperature, but might instead have been mediated by plant root exudates. The water chemistry suggests that DOC production was compensated by in situ mineralization. We hypothesize that an increased hydrolysis of organic matter (OM) was counterbalanced by the mineralization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and that microorganisms preferentially used labile compounds originating from increased root exudates.
   This trade-off between production of DOC through hydrolysis and consumption in the process of mineralization shows (1) the limitation of using only DOC as an indicator of the sensitivity of peat decomposition to climate warming and (2) the need to improve our understanding of the indirect impact of root exudates.

AB Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured from June 2000 through October 2001 by 10 automatic chambers at a peatland in southeastern New Hampshire. The high temporal frequency of this sampling method permitted detailed examination of NEE as it varied daily and seasonally. Summer of 2001 was significantly drier than the 30-year average, while summer of 2000 was wetter than normal. Although NEE varied spatially across the peatland with differences in plant species composition and biomass, maximum CO2 uptake was 30-40% larger in the drier summer in evergreen and deciduous shrub communities but the same or lower in sedge sites. Ecosystem respiration rates were 13-84% larger in the drier summer depending on plant growth form with water table and temperature as strong predictors. Ecosystem respiration was also correlated with maximum ecosystem productivity and foliar biomass suggesting that plant processes, water table, and temperature are tightly linked in their control of respiratory losses. The ratio between maximum productivity and respiration declined for evergreen shrub and sedge sites between the wet and dry summer, but increased in deciduous shrub sites. A drier climate may reduce the CO2 sink function of peatlands for some growth forms and increase it for others, suggesting that ecosystem carbon and climate models should account for differences in growth form responses to climate change. It also implies that plant functional types respond on short timescales to changes in moisture, and that the transition from sedges to shrubs could occur rapidly in peatlands under a drier and warmer climate.

AB The nature of linkages between soil C and N cycling is important in the context of terrestrial ecosystem responses to global environmental change. Extracellular enzymes produced by soil microorganisms drive organic matter decomposition, and are considered sensitive indicators of soil responses to environmental variation. We investigated the response of eight hydrolytic soil enzymes (four peptidases and four glycosidases) to experimental warming in a long-term climate manipulation experiment in a sub-arctic peat bog, to determine to what extent the response of these two functional groups are similar. We found no significant effect of experimental spring and summer warming and/or winter snow addition on either the potential activity or the temperature sensitivity (of V-max) of any of the enzymes. However, strong and contrasting seasonal patterns in both variables were observed. All of the peptidases, as well as alpha-glucosidase, had lower potential activity at the end of summer (August) compared to the beginning (June). Conversely, beta-glucosidase had significantly higher potential activity in August. Peptidases had consistently higher temperature sensitivities in June compared to August, while all four glycosidases showed the opposite pattern. Our results suggest that warming effects on soil enzymes are small compared to seasonal differences, which are most likely mediated by the seasonality of substrate supply and microbial nutrient demand. Furthermore the contrasting seasonal patterns for glycosidases and peptidases suggest that enzyme-based models of soil processes need to allow for potential divergence between the production and activity of these two enzyme functional groups.

AB Ecosystems within the subhumid Boreal Plains of Northern Alberta host ecologically and commercially significant habitat and natural resources. However, these ecosystems exist under a delicate hydrologic balance that may be upset as the climate warms by 2 to 5 degrees C over the next century. In this study, numerical simulations were used to predict climate change impacts at a catchment composed of a mosaic of Boreal Plains ecosystems including a small pond, peatlands with sparse black spruce, and hillslopes with predominantly aspen forests. Simulations were conducted with a fully integrated groundwater-surface water code using a 2-D model previously calibrated to a decade of hydrologic data that included a range in climatic conditions. Projections from 13 climate change scenarios were simulated from 2011 to 2090 and compared to a base case scenario that assumed no climate change. Results indicate peatland water levels may decline by up to 1 m; however, sensitivity simulations indicate that the decline in water levels may be moderated by several feedback mechanisms that restrict evaporative losses and moderate water level changes. In contrast, higher evapotranspiration losses from the aspen hillslopes are predicted to result in near-surface soils becoming increasingly drier. Thus, the aspen may frequently be water stressed and increasingly susceptible to secondary maladies such as pests and disease. Reduced pond water levels are also predicted with the development of frequent ephemeral conditions in warmer and drier scenarios. Concurrent decreases in stream flow may further impact downstream ecosystems. Further research into the regional health and sustainability of Boreal Plains ecosystems is warranted and could benefit from the development of improved numerical tools capable of extending the processes considered.

AB Due to the scarcity of reliable and highly resolved moisture proxies covering much of the Holocene, there has been increased interest in the study of living and subfossil peatland trees sensitive to gradual and extreme changes in hydrology, precipitation, and related environmental processes. Peatland development and the associated carbon accumulation, which are strongly influenced by hydrological fluctuations, are also of prime importance as peatlands represent long-term sinks of atmospheric carbon. Improved knowledge of peatland development and soil moisture variability during the Holocene is therefore essential to our understanding of long-term hydroclimate changes, the terrestrial carbon cycle, and to enable more robust predictions of peatland response to future climate changes.
   Here, we review the existing mid- to late Holocene peatland tree-ring chronologies that have been used to study climate variability on (sub-)annual to centennial scales with a primary focus on northern Europe. Since the 1970s, absolutely dated tree-ring chronologies covering substantial parts of the Holocene have been developed from excavated remains of oak (Quercus spp.) and pine (Pinus sylvestris L). The annual tree-ring patterns of these trees are often characterized by periods of depressed growth reflecting annual to decadal hydroclimatic changes. In addition, changes in the spatio-temporal distribution of trees throughout the Holocene are often found to reflect decadal to centennial climate and hydrological changes. Moreover, synchronicity between tree-ring chronologies and tree-population dynamics over larger geographical areas show periods of coherent regional climate forcing, especially during the mid-Holocene.
   This review (i) provides an overview of pioneering and recent studies presenting tree-ring chronologies developed from subfossil peatland trees, and (ii) presents recent developments in the fields of dendroecology (i.e. the response of tree growth and changes in vitality as a result of changes in climatic variables) and dendroclimatology (i.e. the reconstruction of climate fluctuations based on tree-ring analyses) in peatland regions. Moreover, we (iii) use long-term climate reconstructions based on alternative proxies for comparison, and (iv) present different ways to analyse tree-ring records to generate novel information on annual to centennial timescales. This analysis is based on an unprecedented network of tree-ring chronologies from Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Canada, as well as a wealth of old and previously (un) published literature from Scandinavia and Germany, which has not been accessible to a wider audience in the past due to inaccessibility or linguistic barriers. Finally, a map of possible hotspots for the assessment of continuous peatlandtree studies is presented, along with suggestions for new research directions in the field. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes in boreal peatlands are vulnerable to global change, including climate warming, elevated nitrogen (N) deposition, and vegetation composition change. However, few studies focus on the interactions of these factors, particularly combining all of them, which leads to a large degree of uncertainty in predicting CH4 emissions from peatlands in the future. In this study, experimental warming, N addition, and vegetation composition change were conducted for five years at a boreal peatland in western Newfoundland, Canada. We found that graminoid absence substantially decreased CH4 emissions by 72% owing to the reduction of root exudates for CH4 production and aerenchyma for CH4 transport; however, this negative effect disappeared under the combination of warming and N addition, which can be attributed to the elevated temperature sensitivity of CH4. Additionally, we observed that vegetation productivity was the main control when the graminoid was present, but not the major control when the shrub was present only, suggesting the proper parameters should be selected under different vegetation compositions so as to accurately project CH4 emissions in the context of climate change. Compared with the studies focusing on one or two environmental changes, this experiment is valuable for providing empirical evidence on the parameterization of CH4 fluxes in the biogeochemical model of boreal peatlands and in the global coupled climate-carbon model.

AB Feedbacks to global warming may cause terrestrial ecosystems to add to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, thus exacerbating climate change. The contribution that soil respiration makes to these terrestrial emissions, particularly from carbon-rich soils such as peatlands, is of significant importance and its response to changing climatic conditions is of considerable debate. We collected intact soil cores from an upland blanket bog situated within the northern Pennines, England, UK and investigated the individual and interactive effects of three primary controls on soil organic matter decomposition: (i) temperature (5, 10 and 15 degrees C); (ii) moisture (50 and 100% field capacity - FC); and (iii) substrate quality, using increasing depth from the surface (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) as an analogue for increased recalcitrance of soil organic material. Statistical analysis of the results showed that temperature, moisture and substrate quality all significantly affected rates of peat decomposition. Q(10) values indicated that the temperature sensitivity of older/more recalcitrant soil organic matter significantly increased (relative to more labile peat) under reduced soil moisture (50% FC) conditions, but not under 100% FC, suggesting that soil microorganisms decomposing the more recalcitrant soil material preferred more aerated conditions. Radiocarbon analyses revealed that soil decomposers were able to respire older, more recalcitrant soil organic matter and that the source of the material (deduced from the delta C-13 analyses) subject to decomposition, changed depending on depth in the peat profile.

AB Raised bogs dominated by the vegetation association Ledo-Sphagnetum magellanici Sukopp 1959 em. Neuhausl 1969 are a valuable and ecologically important plant community that occurs in Central Europe. They develop in impervious depressions with precipitation as the only water source, and are particularly sensitive to drainage, climate change, eutrophication and overgrowing by trees and shrubs. The high pressure of threat justifies taking protective measures. This research focused on the effects of the removal of birch from two bogs, which were dominated by two birch species (Betula pubescens, B. pendula) and also included stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris); the bogs are located in northeastern Poland and showed signs of drying. The trees were removed in early spring 2008. To capture the response to tree cutting, vegetation monitoring was performed for 7 years. The results were compared to pre-cutting environmental conditions (precipitation, temperature, air transpiration). At the first site, which was drained at the beginning of the twentieth century, the ground water level initially decreased; then, from 2010 onwards, the level stabilised and exhibited a negative correlation with the average annual air temperature. While the second site exhibited no significant differences in the ground water table, a correlation with the average annual rainfall was found. At both sites, there was an increase in the coverage of species appropriate for raised bogs, Oxycocco-Sphagnatea Br.-Bl. et R. Tx. 1943, whereas only the second site had significant coverage of these species. These actions improved the habitat conditions and initiated the process of raised bog restoration at that site because Oxycocco-Sphagnatea species cover and frequency increased.

AB Inspired by the importance of Redfield-type C : N : P ratios in global soils, we looked for analogous patterns in peatlands and aimed at deciphering the potential affecting factors. By analyzing a suite of peatlands soil data (n = 1031), mean soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) contents were 50.51%, 1.45% and 0.13%, respectively, while average C : N, C : P and N : P ratios were 26.72, 1186.00 and 46.58, respectively. C : N ratios showed smaller variations across different vegetation coverage and had less spatial heterogeneity than C : P and N:P ratios. No consistent C : N : P ratio, though with a general value of 1245 : 47 : 1, was found for entire peatland soils in China. The Northeast China, Tibet, Zoig Plateau and parts of Xinjiang had high soil SOC, TN, TP, and C:P ratio. Qinghai, parts of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the coast zones have low TP and N : P ratio. Significant differences for SOC, TN, TP, C : N, C : P and N : P ratios were observed across groups categorized by predominant vegetation. Moisture, temperature and precipitation all closely related to SOC, TN, TP and their pairwise ratios. The hydrothermal coefficient (RH), defined as annual average precipitation divided by temperature, positively and significantly related to C : N, C : P and N : P ratios, implying that ongoing climate change may prejudice peatlands as carbon sinks during the past 50 years in China.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) in high latitude ecosystems is potentially vulnerable to global climate change. However, the distribution of SOC and total nitrogen (N) is still unknown for the boreal wetlands. In this study, we collected soil samples from different wetlands in the discontinuous permafrost zone of the Xiao Xing'an Mountains, northeastern China. Permafrost was only present in the bogs and fens in this zone. Soil C concentrations were significantly correlated with total N concentrations and bulk density (P < 0.001). Wetland type, soil depth, and incidence of fire affected soil C and total N concentrations, suggesting that vegetation changes in wetlands could alter the soil C and nutrient sequestration processes under future global warming scenarios. However, soil C and total N storage in the 40 cm depth was not significantly different between wetland types (P > 0.05), suggesting that future global warming and vegetation change would not significantly affect soil C and total N storage in upper soil layers in wetlands. However, vegetation changes are likely to increase the depth of the permafrost active layer under permafrost degradation, release deep soil C, and add C to the atmosphere over the coming decades.

AB A meta-modelling approach has been adopted to link simulations of low and high water flows with simulations of suitable climate space for a selection of fen and bog species with differing drought and flood tolerance. The linked meta-models were used to examine the impacts of socio-economic and climate change scenarios on wetlands in two contrasting regions of the UK. The hydrological model shows that low and high flows are sensitive to climate change and to the regional distribution of abstractions and discharges. Where there are large changes in urbanisation, flows are more sensitive to socio-economic change. The changes in high flows have little impact on the species selected, but changes in low flows result in a number of areas becoming marginal or unsuitable due to dryness. At the regional scale, adaptation options appear to be limited and mostly involve, for surface water-influenced wetlands, increased water imports (either directly through increased non-consumptive water demand or indirectly through river augmentation), which may not be consistent with the socio-economic scenario or be feasible. This paper shows, therefore, that changes in hydrological regime are important for the future of wetlands and that these may depend as much on the future socio-economic situation as the projected changes in climate.

AB Peatlands play a significant role in global carbon (C) cycles. Through incubation experiments of peat samples selected in the discontinuous permafrost zone of the Great Hing'an Mountains, we studied the effects of temperature and moisture on potential CO2 emission. Rates of C mineralization decreased with soil depth, increased with temperature, and reached the highest rates at 60% WHC (water holding capacity) at the same temperature. Total C mineralization ranged from 10.3 to 95.0 mg under the treatments for 40 d incubation and was significantly affected by soil temperature and moisture (P < 0.001). Calculated Q (10) values ranged from 2.1 to 2.7, and the average values could be used for multiple regression functions. We successfully predicted C mineralization as a function of incubation time, temperature, and moisture (P < 0.001) and estimated the peat C mineralization under future climate scenarios. The results indicated that C mineralization of peatlands would be accelerated under warming temperature. The peatlands in our study area would be a potential CO2 source to the atmosphere with future climatic changes.

AB The morphology and properties of the soils of permafrost peatlands in the southeast of the Bol'shezemel'skaya tundra are characterized. The soils developing in the areas of barren peat circles differ from oligotrophic permafrost-affected peat soils (Cryic Histosols) of vegetated peat mounds in a number of morphological and physicochemical parameters. The soils of barren circles are characterized by the wellstructured surface horizons, relatively low exchangeable acidity, and higher rates of decomposition and humification of organic matter. It is shown that the development of barren peat circles on tops of peat mounds is favored by the activation of erosional and cryogenic processes in the topsoil. The role of winter wind erosion in the destruction of the upper peat and litter horizons is demonstrated. A comparative analysis of the temperature regime of soils of vegetated peat mounds and barren peat circles is presented. The soil-geocryological complex of peat mounds is a system consisting of three major layers: seasonally thawing layer-upper permafrost-underlying permafrost. The upper permafrost horizons of peat mounds at the depth of 50-90 cm are morphologically similar to the underlying permafrost. However, these layers differ in their physicochemical properties, especially in the composition and properties of their organic matter.

AB Pollen, spore, macrofossil and carbon data from a peatland near Cordova, Alaska, reveal insights into the climate-vegetation-carbon interactions from the initiation of the Holocene, c. the last 11.5 ka, to the present (1 ka = 1000 calibrated years before present where 0 = 1950 CE). The Holocene period is characterized by early deposition of gyttja in a pond environment with aquatics such as Nuphar polysepalum and Potamogeton, and a significant regional presence of Alnus crispa subsp. sinuata. Carbon accumulation (50 g/m(2)/a) was high for a short interval in the early Holocene when Sphagnum peat accumulated, but was followed by a major decline to 13 g/m(2)/a from 7 to 3.7 ka when Cyperaceae and ericads such as Rhododendron (formerly Ledum) groenlandicum expanded. This shift to sedge growth is representative of many peatlands throughout the south-central region of Alaska, and indicates a drier, more evaporative environment with a large decline in carbon storage. The subsequent return to Sphagnum peat after 4 ka in the Neoglacial represents a widespread shift to moister, cooler conditions, which favored a resurgence of ericads, such as Andromeda polifolia, and increased carbon accumulation rate. The sustained Alnus expansion visible in the top 10 cm of the peat profile is correlative with glacial retreat and warming of the region in the last century, and suggests this colonization will continue as temperature increases and ice melts.

AB Extreme climate events are predicted to become more frequent and intense. Their ecological impacts, particularly on carbon cycling, can differ in relation to ecosystem sensitivity. Peatlands, being characterized by peat accumulation under waterlogged conditions, can be particularly sensitive to climate extremes if the climate event increases soil oxygenation. However, a mechanistic understanding of peatland responses to persistent climate extremes is still lacking, particularly in terms of aboveground-belowground feedback. Here, we present the results of a transplantation experiment of peat mesocosms from high to low altitude in order to simulate, during 3years, a mean annual temperature c. 5 degrees C higher and a mean annual precipitation c. 60% lower. Specifically, we aim at understanding the intensity of changes for a set of biogeochemical processes and their feedback on carbon accumulation. In the transplanted mesocosms, plant productivity showed a species-specific response depending on plant growth forms, with a significant decrease (c. 60%) in peat moss productivity. Soil respiration almost doubled and Q(10) halved in the transplanted mesocosms in combination with an increase in activity of soil enzymes. Spectroscopic characterization of peat chemistry in the transplanted mesocosms confirmed the deepening of soil oxygenation which, in turn, stimulated microbial decomposition. After 3years, soil carbon stock increased only in the control mesocosms whereas a reduction in mean annual carbon accumulation of c. 30% was observed in the transplanted mesocosms. Based on the above information, a structural equationmodel was built to provide a mechanistic understanding of the causal connections between peat moisture, vegetation response, soil respiration and carbon accumulation. This study identifies, in the feedback between plant and microbial responses, the primary pathways explaining the reduction in carbon accumulation in response to recurring climate extremes in peat soils.

AB Catchments draining peat soils provide the majority of drinking water in the UK. Over the past decades, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have increased in surface waters. Residual DOC can cause harmful carcinogenic disinfection by-products to form during water treatment processes. Increased frequency and severity of droughts combined with and increased temperatures expected as the climate changes, have potentials to change water quality. We used a novel approach to investigate links between climate change, DOC release and subsequent effects on drinking water treatment. We designed a climate manipulation experiment to simulate projected climate changes and monitored releases from peat soil and litter, then simulated coagulation used in water treatment. We showed that the 'drought' simulation was the dominant factor altering DOC release and affected the ability to remove DOC. Our results imply that future short-term drought events could have a greater impact than increased temperature on DOC treatability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Activated carbons have been widely used for water treatment due to their large surface area and structural stability. Their high cost has motivated the development of sustainable bio-based sorbents. However, their industrial acceptance within the water industry is limited by lower surface areas and poorer adsorptive capacities as compared with commercial sorbents. We herein report a green, high performance porous carbon produced from boreal peats for organic micropollutant removal. Boreal peatlands are increasingly damaged due to climate change-induced wildfires and droughts, which lead to increased run-off and impeded forest regrowth. Fireimpacted peatland soils therefore were excavated and converted into value-added porous carbons through ZnCl2 activation at low temperature (400 - 600 degrees C). These products have significantly higher surface areas (> 1377 m(2)/g) than commercial activated carbon Norit GSX (965 m(2)/g). Adsorption of p-nitrophenol, a micropollutant, onto the porous carbons is efficient, and superior to that of Norit GSX and most sorbents reported in the literature. Adsorption mainly occurred through multi-layer chemisorption and was impacted by the electron donor-acceptor complexes mechanism, pi-pi interactions and steric effects. Because of the massive environmental and economic benefits, peat porous carbons are strong candidates for use in large-scale water treatment facilities.

AB The study of environmental change during the 'Little Ice Age' ('LIA') offers a great potential to improve our current understanding of the climate system and human-environment interactions. Here, a high-resolution multiproxy investigation of a Mediterranean mire from central-western Spain, covering the last similar to 700 years, was used to reconstruct peat dynamics and land-use change and to gain further insights into their relationship with 'LIA' climate (temperature and moisture). To accomplish this, concentrations and accumulation rates of major and minor lithogenic (Si, K, Ti, Rb and Zr) and biophilic (C and N) elements, as well as humification indices (UV-absorbance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)) and pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs, were determined. Peatland dynamics seems to have been coupled to changes in solar irradiance and hydrological conditions. Our results point to wetter conditions after the mid-16th century, although with high intra-annual fluctuations. At the late 18th century, when solar activity was systematically higher than before, peat carbon accumulation rates (PCAR) showed a continuous increase and the humification indices suggest a change towards more humified peat. Enhanced soil erosion occurred at similar to AD 1660-1800 (SE1), similar to AD 1830-1920 (SE2) and similar to AD 1940-1970 (SE3), although a minor increase in Si fluxes was also detected by similar to AD 1460-1580. All phases coincided with higher abundances of fire indicators, but the changes recorded during the similar to AD 1460-1580 event and SE1 coincide with the Sporer and Maunder minima, so a climatic influence on soil erosion cannot be discounted. Changes in the sources of mineral matter to the catchment between similar to AD 1550 and similar to AD 1650 and since the mid-17th century were likely related to modifications of tree cover and/or variations in wind strength.

AB Bodies of peatland permafrost were examined at five sites along a 300 km transect spanning the isolated patches permafrost zone in the coastal barrens of southeastern Labrador. Mean annual air temperatures ranged from C 1 degrees C in the south (latitude 51.4 ffi N) to 1 : 1 degrees C in the north (53.7 degrees N) while mean ground temperatures at the top of the permafrost varied respectively from 0 : 7 to 2 : 3 degrees C with shallow active layers (40-60 cm) throughout. Small surface offsets due to wind scouring of snow from the crests of palsas and peat plateaux, and large thermal offsets due to thick peat are critical to permafrost, which is absent in wetland and forested and forest-tundra areas inland, notwithstanding average air temperatures much lower than near the coast. Most permafrost peatland bodies are less than 5m thick, with a maximum of 10 m, with steep geothermal gradients. Onedimensional thermal modelling for two sites showed that they are in equilibrium with the current climate, but the permafrost mounds are generally relict and could not form today without the low snow depths that result from a heaved peat surface. Despite the warm permafrost, model predictions using downscaled global warming scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) indicate that perennially frozen ground will thaw from the base up and may persist at the southern site until the middle of the 21st century. At the northern site, permafrost is more resilient, persisting to the 2060s under RCP8.5, the 2090s under RCP4.5, or beyond the 21st century under RCP2.6. Despite evidence of peatland permafrost degradation in the study region, the local-scale modelling suggests that the southern boundary of permafrost may not move north as quickly as previously hypothesized.

AB Drained peatlands are significant hotspots of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and may also be more vulnerable to fire with its associated gaseous emissions. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from peatlands managed for extraction are reported on an annual basis. However, the Tier 1 (default) emission factors (EFs) provided in the IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement for this land use category may not be representative in all cases and countries are encouraged to move to higher-tier reporting levels with reduced uncertainty levels based on country- or regional-specific data. In this study, we quantified (1) CO2-C emissions from nine peat extraction sites in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, which were initially disaggregated by land use type (industrial versus domestic peat extraction), and (2) a range of GHGs that are released to the atmosphere with the burning of peat. Drainage-related methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions as well as CO2-C emissions associated with the off-site decomposition of horticultural peat were not included here. Our results show that net CO2-C emissions were strongly controlled by soil temperature at the industrial sites (bare peat) and by soil temperature and leaf area index at the vegetated domestic sites. Our derived EFs of 1.70 (+/-0.47) and 1.64 (+/-0.44) tCO(2)-C ha(-1) yr(-1) for the industrial and domestic sites respectively are considerably lower than the Tier 1 EF (2.8 +/- 1.7t CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) provided in the Wetlands Supplement. We propose that the difference between our derived values and the Wetlands Supplement value is due to differences in peat quality and, consequently, decomposition rates. Emissions from burning of the peat (gkg(-1) dry fuel burned) were estimated to be approximately 1346 CO2, 8.35 methane (CH4), 218 carbon monoxide (CO), 1.53 ethane (C2H6), 1.74 ethylene (C2H4), 0.60 methanol (CH3OH), 2.21 hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and 0.73 ammonia (NH3), and this emphasises the importance of understanding the full suite of trace gas emissions from biomass burning. Our results highlight the importance of generating reliable Tier 2 values for different regions and land use categories. Furthermore, given that the IPCC Tier 1 EF was only based on 20 sites (all from Canada and Fennoscandia), we suggest that data from another 9 sites significantly expand the global data set, as well as adding a new region.

AB We used a flux deconstruction approach on peat and sediment archives of four bogs and five lakes from two subarctic taiga ecoregions of the Northwest Territories (Canada) to distinguish the atmospheric and catchment based responses to changing metal pollution emissions over the last 2000 years. Bogs tracked the atmospheric signal, whereas lake sediments provided a mixed atmospheric and catchment-based response. Anthropogenic mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) contamination was identified in lake sediment and bog records from the mid 1800s onward and increased rapidly after ca. 1900. Long-range transport of Hg and Pb was likely the dominant source of the post-1900 enrichment in lake sediments, with minor contributions from local mining, mostly between 1950 and 1970. Bogs and sediment records of small lakes on the Taiga Plains showed that atmospheric deposition peaked in the late 1990s for Pb and in the 1970s for Hg. In contrast, the Pb and Hg accumulation rates in Taiga Shield lakes have continued to increase since the peak atmospheric deposition period due to on-going catchment transport, and may reflect recent climate change favoring late-fall and early-winter precipitation as rain rather than snow. The divergent trends in metal accumulation rates between ecoregions and environmental archives demonstrate that interactions of climate and catchment characteristics will be key to future contamination trajectories for subarctic lakes following reductions of anthropogenic metal emissions in North America.

AB Northern peatlands are increasingly threatened by climate change and industrial activities. This study examined the impact of simulated droughts on pore water chemistry at six peatlands in Sudbury, Ontario, that differ in copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) contamination, including a site that had been previously limed. All sites responded similarly to simulated drought: pore water pH declined significantly following the 30 day drought and the decline was greater following the 60 day drought treatment. The decline in pore water pH was due to increasing sulphate concentrations, whereas nitrate increased more in the 60 day drought treatment. Decreases in pH were accompanied by large increases in Ni and Co that greatly exceeded provincial water quality guidelines. In contrast, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations decreased significantly following drought, along with concentrations of Cu and Al, which are strongly complexed by organic acids.

AB The carbon (C) balance of boreal peatlands is mainly the sum of three different C fluxes: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). lntra- and inter-annual dynamics of these fluxes are differentially controlled by similar factors, such as temperature and water-table. Different climatic conditions within and between years might thus result in varying absolute and relative contributions of each flux to net ecosystem productivity (NEP). In this study CO2 fluxes were measured at a boreal peatland in eastern Finland during a dry year (2006) and a wet year (2007) and combined with DOC and CH4 fluxes from the same site. CO2 uptake in the wet year was 65% higher than in the dry year, caused by higher water table (WT) and subsequently reduced rates of soil respiration. Two to three-fold increases in DOC and CH4 fluxes in the wet year did not completely offset the higher CO2 uptake in that year, resulting in NEP of -83.7 +/- 14 g C M-2 in the dry and 134.5 +/- 21 g C 111(-2) in the wet year. Thus, in our study, WT was identified as the most important factor responsible for variations in the C balance between the observed years. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB Spatial patterning of ecosystems can be explained by several mechanisms. One approach to disentangling the influence of these mechanisms is to study a patterned ecosystem along a gradient of environmental conditions. This study focused on hummock-hollow patterning of peatlands. Previous models predicted that patterning in drainage-dominated peatlands is driven by a peat-accumulation mechanism, reflected by higher nutrient availability in hollows relative to hummocks. Alternatively, patterning in evapotranspiration (ET)-dominated peatlands may be driven by a nutrient-accumulation mechanism, reflected by reversed nutrient distribution, namely, higher nutrient availability in hummocks relative to hollows. Here, we tested these predictions by comparing nutrient distributions among patterned peatlands in maritime (Scotland), humid temperate (Sweden), and humid continental (Siberia) climates. The areas comprise a climatic gradient from very wet and drainage-dominated (Scotland) to less wet and ET-dominated (Siberia) peatlands. Nutrient distribution was quantified as resource contrast, a measure for hummock-hollow difference in nutrient availability. We tested the hypothesis that the climatic gradient shows a trend in the resource contrast; from negative (highest nutrient availability in hollows) in Scotland to positive (highest nutrient availability in hummocks) in Siberia. The resource contrasts as measured in vegetation indeed showed a trend along the climatic gradient: contrasts were negative to slightly positive in Scotland, positive in Sweden, and strongly positive in Siberia. This finding corroborates the main prediction of previous models. Our results, however, also provided indications for further model development. The low concentrations of nutrients in the water suggest that existing models could be improved by considering both the dissolved and adsorbed phase and explicit inclusion of both nutrient-uptake and nutrient-storage processes. Our study suggests that future climate change may affect the ecosystem functioning of patterned peatlands by altering the contribution of pattern-forming mechanisms to redistribution of water and nutrients within these systems.

AB Calcareous spring fens are among the rarest and most endangered wetland types worldwide. The majority of these ecosystems can be found at high latitudes, where they are affected by above average rates of climate change. Particularly winter temperatures are increasing, which results in decreased snow cover. As snow provides an insulating layer that protects ecosystems from subzero temperatures, its decrease is likely to induce stress to plants. To investigate the sensitivity of the bryophyte community - key to the functioning of calcareous spring fens - to changing climatic conditions, we studied the annual variation in ecophysiology of two dominant bryophytes: Campylium stellatum and Scorpidium scorpioides. Further, a snow removal experiment was used to simulate the effect of changing winter conditions. In both species, we observed lowest efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) in spring, indicating physiological stress, and highest chlorophyll-a, -b and carotenoid concentrations in autumn. Snowremoval exacerbated physiological stress in bryophytes. Consequently Fv/Fm, pigment concentrations and chlorophyll to carotenoids ratios declined, while chlorophyll-a to -b ratios increased. Moreover, these effects of winter climate change cascaded to the growing season. C. stellatum, a low hummock inhabitor, suffered more from snow removal (annual mean decline in Fv/Fm 7.7% and 30.0% in chlorophyll-a) than S. scorpioides, a hollow species (declines 5.4% and 14.5%, respectively). Taken together, our results indicate that spring fen bryophytes are negatively impacted by winter climate change, as a result of longer frost periods and increased numbers of freeze-thaw cycles in combination with higher light intensity and dehydration.

AB Vegetation removal with fire can alter the thermal regime of the land surface, leading to significant changes in biogeochemistry (e.g. carbon cycling) and soil hydrology. In the UK, large expanses of carbonrich upland environments are managed to encourage increased abundance of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) by rotational burning of shrub vegetation. To date, though, there has not been any consideration of whether prescribed vegetation burning on peatlands modifies the thermal regime of the soil mass in the years after fire. In this study thermal regime was monitored across 12 burned peatland soil plots over an 18-month period, with the aim of (i) quantifying thermal dynamics between burned plots of different ages (from <2 to 15 + years post burning), and (ii) developing statistical models to determine the magnitude of thermal change caused by vegetation management. Compared to plots burned 15 + years previously, plots recently burned (<2-4 years) showed higher mean, maximum and range of soil temperatures, and lower minima. Statistical models (generalised least square regression) were developed to predict daily mean and maximum soil temperature in plots burned 15+ years prior to the study. These models were then applied to predict temperatures of plots burned 2, 4 and 7 years previously, with significant deviations from predicted temperatures illustrating the magnitude of burn management effects. Temperatures measured in soil plots burned <2 years previously showed significant statistical disturbances from model predictions, reaching +6.2 degrees C for daily mean temperatures and +19.6 degrees C for daily maxima. Soil temperatures in plots burnt 7 years previously were most similar to plots burned.15 + years ago indicating the potential for soil temperatures to recover as vegetation regrows. Our findings that prescribed peatland vegetation burning alters soil thermal regime should provide an impetus for further research to understand the consequences of thermal regime change for carbon processing and release, and hydrological processes, in these peatlands.

AB Nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) deposition, as well as altered soil moisture dynamics due to climate change can have large effects on fen meadow biogeochemistry and vegetation. Their combined effects may differ strongly from their separate effects, since each process affects different nutrients through different mechanisms. However, the impacts of these environmental problems are rarely studied in combination. We therefore investigated the separate and interactive effects of current levels of N- and S-deposition and changes in soil moisture dynamics on fen meadow vegetation. We focused on vegetation biomass and N:P stoichiometry, including access to soil P through root surface phosphatase activity, in a 3-year factorial addition experiment in an N-limited rich fen meadow in the Biebrza valley in Poland. We applied 29.5 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 32.1 kg S ha(-1) year(-1), which correspond to current deposition levels in Western Europe. Changes in soil moisture dynamics due to climate change were mimicked by amplified drying of the soil in summer. This level of N-deposition had limited effects on plant biomass production in this rich fen, despite low foliar N:P ratios that suggest N limitation. This level of S-deposition, however, resulted in decreased vegetation P-uptake and biomass. We also showed that increased summer drought resulted in considerable increases in vegetation biomass. We found no interactive effects on vegetation biomass or N:P stoichiometry, possibly as a result of the limited main effects of the separate processes.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of methane (CH4) net flux were made in a boreal fen, typical of the most abundant peatlands in western Canada during May-September 2007. The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) the magnitude of diurnal and seasonal variation in CH4 net flux, (ii) the relationship between the temporally varying flux rates and associated changes in controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and (iii) the contribution of CH4 emission to the ecosystem growing season carbon budget. There was significant diurnal variation in CH4 emission during the peak of the growing season that was strongly correlated with associated changes in solar radiation, latent heat flux, air temperature and ecosystem conductance to water vapor. During days 181-215, nighttime average CH4 efflux was only 47% of the average midday values. The peak value for daily average CH4 emission rate was approximately 80 nmol m-2 s-1 (4.6 mg CH4 m-2 h-1), and seasonal variation in CH4 flux was strongly correlated with changes in soil temperature. Integrated over the entire measurement period [days 144-269 (late May-late September)], the total CH4 emission was 3.2 g CH4 m-2, which was quite low relative to other wetland ecosystems and to the simultaneous high rate of ecosystem net CO2 sequestration that was measured (18.1 mol CO2 m-2 or 217 g C m-2). We estimate that the negative radiative forcing (cooling) associated with net carbon storage over the life of the peatland (approximately 2200 years) was at least twice the value of positive radiative forcing (warming) caused by net CH4 emission over the last 50 years.

AB There is increasing evidence that drought is leading to increased loss of dissolved organic carbon from upland peats. Therefore, this study endeavours to understand the severity and frequency of the scale of drought responsible for driving the observed changes; and, by reconstructing climatic records, to understand whether such droughts are increasing in severity and frequency. The study suggests that there are two levels of drought severity important in the peatlands: a hydrological drought that causes hydrophobic effects in the upper peat profile lasting 3-4 years in duration, and a more severe biogeochemical drought that triggers new mechanisms of DOC production and decade-long effects. The study uses long term climate data from Central England and Northern England to reconstructs depth to water table for an upland peat catchment back to 1766 and shows that hydrological drought has a return period of 25 years and that biogeochemical drought has a return period of 15.5 years. Statistical modelling of the time series of annual droughts shows only weak evidence for an increasing frequency of severe droughts since 1766, but stronger evidence for the recent past. The return period of drought of sufficient severity to cause biogeochemical response is coming close to the length of effect such a drought would have, i.e. trends in drought frequency mean that peatlands may no longer be resilient to the impact of drought, with dire consequences for the storage of carbon in these environments.

AB The influence of sea-level and climate changes on the evolution of coastal floodplains is an important problem in fluvial geomorphology and geology. However, few studies have constructed detailed chronologies of floodplain evolution, and the influence of sea-level and climate changes at submillennial time scales is not clear. This study investigated the Holocene evolution of the floodplain in the Shiribeshi-Toshibetsu River lowland, Hokkaido, northern Japan, based on 13 auger cores, 15 radiocarbon ages, and 2 cross sections made using existing columnar sections. In the study area, peat beds 3-6 m thick in the uppermost Holocene sediments are underlain by fluvial sediment that mainly consists of sand beds resulting from crevassing or progradational avulsion. Age elevation plots of the bases of these peat beds suggest that fluvial aggradation was continuous until peat formation began, which in turn suggests that peat beds began to form with the cessation of fluvial deposition. The chronology of floodplain sediments based on radiocarbon ages indicates that peatlands began to develop locally before ca. 6500 cal BP and became moderately widespread before 5600 cal BP. Peatlands then became more extensive after two periods of rapid expansion during ca. 5300-5000 and 4100-3900 cal BP. Comparison with sea-level and regional climate changes suggests that the initiation of these peat beds before 5600 cal BP was associated with the deceleration of sea-level rise at ca. 7000 cal BP. The two later periods of peatland expansion may have been strongly influenced by reduced fluvial activity due to decreased precipitation from a weakened East Asian summer monsoon. This interpretation suggests that floodplain evolution was controlled by sea-level and climate changes and that the response to climate change occurred at submillennial time scales. A comparison with the Ishikari lowland on Hokkaido showed that the two floodplains have slightly different histories, possibly because of differences in internal characteristics of the fluvial systems such as the number and size of tributary rivers, water discharge, and sediment supply, although their responses to sea-level and climate changes were similar. The fluvial response to sea-level and climate changes revealed in this study has implications for studies of the Holocene evolution of other coastal floodplains.

AB Fens represent a large array of ecosystem services, including the highest biodiversity found among wetlands, hydrological services, water purification and carbon sequestration. Land-use change and drainage has severely damaged or annihilated these services in many parts of North America and Europe; restoration plans are urgently needed at the landscape level. We review the major constraints on the restoration of rich fens and fen water bodies in agricultural areas in Europe and disturbed landscapes in North America: (i) habitat quality problems: drought, eutrophication, acidification, and toxicity, and (ii) recolonization problems: species pools, ecosystem fragmentation and connectivity, genetic variability, and invasive species; and here provide possible solutions. We discuss both positive and negative consequences of restoration measures, and their causes. The restoration of wetland ecosystem functioning and services has, for a long time, been based on a trial-and-error approach. By presenting research and practice on the restoration of rich fen ecosystems within agricultural areas, we demonstrate the importance of biogeochemical and ecological knowledge at different spatial scales for the management and restoration of biodiversity, water quality, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, especially in a changing climate. We define target processes that enable scientists, nature managers, water managers and policy makers to choose between different measures and to predict restoration prospects for different types of deteriorated fens and their starting conditions.

AB Recent climate change has reduced the spatial extent and thickness of permafrost in many discontinuous permafrost regions. Rapid permafrost thaw is producing distinct landscape changes in the Taiga Plains of the Northwest Territories, Canada. As permafrost bodies underlying forested peat plateaus shrink, the landscape slowly transitions into unforested wetlands. The expansion of wetlands has enhanced the hydrologic connectivity of many watersheds via new surface and near-surface flow paths, and increased streamflow has been observed. Furthermore, the decrease in forested peat plateaus results in a net loss of boreal forest and associated ecosystems. This study investigates fundamental processes that contribute to permafrost thaw by comparing observed and simulated thaw development and landscape transition of a peat plateau-wetland complex in the Northwest Territories, Canada from 1970 to 2012. Measured climate data are first used to drive surface energy balance simulations for the wetland and peat plateau. Near-surface soil temperatures simulated in the surface energy balance model are then applied as the upper boundary condition to a three-dimensional model of subsurface water flow and coupled energy transport with freeze-thaw. Simulation results demonstrate that lateral heat transfer, which is not considered in many permafrost models, can influence permafrost thaw rates. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that landscape evolution arising from permafrost thaw acts as a positive feedback mechanism that increases the energy absorbed at the land surface and produces additional permafrost thaw. The modeling results also demonstrate that flow rates in local groundwater flow systems may be enhanced by the degradation of isolated permafrost bodies.

AB Soil microbial communities significantly contribute to global fluxes of nutrients and carbon. Their response to climate change, including winter warming, is expected to modify these processes through direct effects on microbial functions due to osmotic stress, and changing temperature regimes. Using four European peatlands reflecting different frequencies of frost events, we show that peatland testate amoeba communities diverge among sites with different winter climates, and that this is reflected through contrasting functions. We found that exposure to harder soil frost promoted species (3-diversity (species turnover) thus shifting the community composition of testate amoebae. In particular, we found that harder soil frost, and lower water-soluble phenolic compounds, induced functional turnover through the decrease of large species (-68%, >80 mu m) and the increase of small-bodied mixotrophic species (i.e. Archerella flavum; +79%). These results suggest that increased exposure to soil frost could be highly limiting for large species while smaller species are more resistant. Furthermore, we found that beta-glucosidase enzymatic activity, in addition to soil temperature, strongly depended of the functional diversity of testate amoebae (R-2 = 0.95, ANOVA). Changing winter conditions can therefore strongly impact peatland decomposition process, though it remains unclear if these changes are carried-over to the growing season. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) records from vascular plant dominated peatlands have been used as a palaeoclimate proxy, but a better empirical understanding of fractionation processes in these ecosystems is required. Here, we test the potential of delta C-13 analysis of ombrotrophic restiad peatlands in New Zealand, dominated by the wire rush (Empodisma spp.), to provide a methodology for developing palaeoclimatic records. We took surface plant samples alongside measurements of water table depth and (micro) climate over spatial (six sites spanning > 10 degrees latitude) and temporal (monthly measurements over 1 year) gradients and analysed the relationships between cellulose delta C-13 values and environmental parameters. We found strong, significant negative correlations between delta C-13 and temperature, photosynthetically active radiation and growing degree days above 0 degrees C. No significant relationships were observed between delta C-13 and precipitation, relative humidity, soil moisture or water table depth, suggesting no growing season water limitation and a decoupling of the expected link between delta C-13 in vascular plants and hydrological variables. delta C-13 of Empodisma spp. roots may therefore provide a valuable temperature proxy in a climatically sensitive region, but further physiological and sub-fossil calibration studies are required to fully understand the observed signal.

AB Raised bogs have accumulated more atmospheric carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Climate-induced expansion of trees and shrubs may turn these ecosystems from net carbon sinks into sources when associated with reduced water tables. Increasing water loss through tree evapotranspiration could potentially deepen water tables, thus stimulating peat decomposition and carbon release. Bridging the gap between modelling and field studies, we conducted a three-year mesocosm experiment subjecting natural bog vegetation to three birch tree densities, and studied the changes in subsurface temperature, water balance components, leaf area index and vegetation composition. We found the deepest water table in mesocosms with low tree density. Mesocosms with high tree density remained wettest (i.e. highest water tables) whereas the control treatment without trees had intermediate water tables. These differences are attributed mostly to differences in evapotranspiration. Although our mesocosm results cannot be directly scaled up to ecosystem level, the systematic effect of tree density suggests that as bogs become colonized by trees, the effect of trees on ecosystem water loss changes with time, with tree transpiration effects of drying becoming increasingly offset by shading effects during the later phases of tree encroachment. These density-dependent effects of trees on water loss have important implications for the structure and functioning of peatbogs.

AB Restoration of rich fens is commonly attempted through local-scale measures, such as removal of sod or blockage of ditches. However, regional-scale restoration measures, that aim to re-establish the original hydrology in which rich fens developed, might have a more long-lasting effect. We investigated the effect of local- and regional-scale restoration measures on a vulnerable rich fen in the Naardermeer nature reserve in the Netherlands. We compared water quality and vegetation composition of the fen before and after the restoration measures, almost 30 years apart. Overall rich fen species increased and although this indicates the desired increased supply of fresh mineral-rich groundwater to the fen, continued succession towards poor fen vegetation has not been prevented in the entire fen. Despite sod layer removal, we observed an increase in aPolytrichum-dominated vegetation in patches that are primarily fed by rainwater. Our findings confirm results from a previous study which showed that brackish palaeo-groundwater is still contributing substantially to the water balance of the fen, especially in periods of precipitation deficit. We conclude that the local- and regional-scale restoration measures have been successful in increasing the abundance of rich fen species in parts of the fen. However, considering the pressures of climate change and high atmospheric N-deposition on the fen, it is uncertain whether rich fen species can be sustained in quite nutrient-poor conditions in the future. Therefore, there is a need for continued management that keeps the nutrient-poor and mineral-rich conditions of the fen intact.

AB Carbon export in streams draining peat catchments represents a potential loss of carbon from long-term stores to downstream aquatic systems and ultimately, through mineralisation, to the atmosphere. There is now a large body of evidence that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export has increased significantly in recent decades at many sites, although there is still debate about the drivers of this increase. In this study, DOC export and particulate organic carbon (POC) export were quantified from a forested peatland catchment in the west of Ireland over two years at a fine temporal resolution. The principle drivers of change in stream DOC and POC concentrations were investigated using a general additive modelling (GAM) approach. The study period included drought conditions in the early summer of 2010 and clearfelling of some commercial forestry in early 2011. The results indicated that annual loads of 9.5 t DOC km(2) year(-1) and 6.2 t POC km(2) year(-1) were exported from the catchment in 2010. This combined annual load of 15.7 t C km(2) year(-1) would represent between 0.01% and 0.02% of typical estimates for peat soil carbon storage in the region. Soil temperature, river discharge and drought explained 59.7% the deviance in DOC concentrations, while soil temperature, river discharge, and rainfall were the significant drivers of variation in POC concentrations, explaining 58.3% of deviance. Although clearfelling was not a significant factor in either model, large spikes in POC export occurred in 2011 after the first forestry clearance. The results illustrate the complexity of the interactions between climate and land management in driving stream water carbon export. They also highlight the sensitivity of peatland carbon stores to changes in temperature and precipitation, which are projected to be more extreme and variable under future climate scenarios.

AB A Sphagnum Peatland Distribution Model (SPDM) was developed that relatively accurately reconstructs the current distribution of Sphagnum peatlands in North America based on two climatic variables: Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) and Mean Annual Total Precipitation (MATP). The SPDM was coupled with data obtained from two General Circulation Models (GCMs) in order to predict the distribution of Sphagnum peatlands for modem climatic conditions and conditions that existed at 6,000 years before present (6 ka BP) and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at 21 ka BP. The predictions were evaluated by comparing them to the distribution of Sphagnum peatlands as reconstructed from analysis of Sphagnum spores in lake sediments for each time slice. Evaluations of the two GCMs reveal that both have strengths and failings. The Canadian Climate Centers (CCC) GCM predicts the distribution of Sphagnum peatlands more accurately than the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) GCM for current and 6 ka BP conditions, while GFDL data is more accurate for the LGM. CCC errors of commission for current and 6 ka BP for the northern mid-latitudes, particularly in the Great Plains and Columbia and Great Basins, are caused by a predicted climate that is too cold and too wet. Results also indicate that the GFDL predictions for northern latitudes are too warm and produce many errors of commission for current and 6 ka BP conditions. Evaluation also determined that GFDL climate change predictions (current-6 ka BP) were too dry. Although Sphagnum spore analyses indicate that both GCMs produce many errors when predicting the distribution of Sphagnum peatlands during LGM, the number of those errors is considerably reduced when the GCM predictions are compared to the distribution of Picea pollen, which is indicative of boreal and subarctic regions.

AB Peat sediments and peatland evolution process offer abundant clues into the history of vegetation and climate changes. In order to reconstruct Holocene peatland, vegetation and climate changes on eastern Tibetan Plateau, we conducted analyses of fossil pollen, loss-on-ignition, and carbon accumulation rate on one peat core from Zoige Basin. Our results show local peatland initiated at 10.3 ka, thrived in the early-mid Holocene, and then began to degrade. Throughout the Holocene, Zoige Basin was dominated by alpine meadow. Coniferous forest on montane regions expanded for several times during 10.5-4.6 ka, and then dramatically retreated. Results of peatland property, principal component analysis on fossil pollen suggested the climate maintained warm/wet during 10-5.5 ka, and became relatively cold/dry in the late Holocene. Rapid degradation of peatland, retreat of coniferous forest and climatic drought/cooling occurred at 10.2-10, 9.7-9.5, 8.7-8.5, 7.7-7.4, 6.4-6, 5.5-5.2, 4.8-4.5, 4-3.6, 3.1-2.7, 1.4-1.2 and 0.8-0.6 ka. The long-term variations of Holocene climate and vegetation on eastern Tibetan Plateau could be attributed to changes in insolation-driven temperature and Asian Summer Monsoon intensity, while those rapid centennial changes were probably triggered by abrupt monsoon failures and temperature anomalies in the high northern latitudes.

AB Peatlands cover only about 3% of the Earth's surface and store 15-30% of the Global soil carbon as a peat. However, human intervention and climate change threatens the stability of peatlands, owing to deforest, wildfire, mining, drainage, glacial retreat, and permafrost. In our study, we modified the SWAT model to couple snow, soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission. Then the modified SWAT was used for predicting snow depth, soil temperature at different depths and carbon dioxide emission from peatlands and other land uses at Athabasca river basin, Canada. The results of the study indicated that SWAT model estimated the daily snow depth with R-2, NSE, RMSE and PBIAS values of 0.83, 0.76, 0.52 and - 2.3 in the calibration period (2006-2007) and 0.79, 0.71, 0.97 and -3.6 for the validation period (2008-2009), respectively. The SWAT model also predicted soil temperature very well at three depths (5 cm, 10 cm and 30 cm). The simulation model results also confirmed that the modified SWAT model estimates the CO2 emission at Athabasca river basin with good model fit during calibration (R-2 = 0.71, NSE = 0.67, RMSE = 2.6 and PBIAS = 3.2) and during validation (R-2 = 0.63, NSE = 0.58, RMSE = 3.1 and PBIAS = 9.3). Overall, our result confirmed that SWAT model performed well in representing the dynamics of snow depth, soil temperature and CO2 emissions in the peatlands at the Athabasca river basin.

AB Current projections suggest that climate warming will be accompanied by more frequent and severe drought events. Peatlands store ca. one third of the world's soil organic carbon. Warming and drought may cause peatlands to become carbon sources through stimulation of microbial activity increasing ecosystem respiration, with positive feedback effect on global warming. Micro-eukaryotes play a key role in the carbon cycle through food web interactions and therefore, alterations in their community structure and diversity may affect ecosystem functioning and could reflect these changes. We assessed the diversity and community composition of Sphagnum-associated eukaryotic microorganisms inhabiting peatlands and their response to experimental drought and warming using high throughput sequencing of environmental DNA. Under drier conditions, micro-eukaryotic diversity decreased, the relative abundance of autotrophs increased and that of osmotrophs (including Fungi and Peronosporomycetes) decreased. Furthermore, we identified climate change indicators that could be used as early indicators of change in peatland microbial communities and ecosystem functioning. The changes we observed indicate a shift towards a more "terrestrial'' community in response to drought, in line with observed changes in the functioning of the ecosystem.

AB Northern hemisphere peatlands are substantial carbon stores. However, recent climate change and human impacts (e.g., drainage and atmospheric nutrient deposition) may trigger the emission of their stored carbon to the atmosphere. Biodiversity losses are also an important consequence of those changes. Therefore, there is a need to recognise these processes in space and time. Global change experiments are often conducted to improve our understanding of the potential responses of various ecosystems to global warming and drought. Most of the experiments carried out in peatlands are focused on carbon balance and nitrogen deposition. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how fast peatlands respond to temperature changes and water-table lowering in the continental climate setting. This is important because continental regions account for a significant proportion of all northern hemisphere peatlands. A combination of short-term and long-term approaches in a single research project is especially helpful because it facilitates the correct interpretation of experimental data. Here we describe the CLIMPEAT project - a manipulative field experiment in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland supported by a high-resolution multi-proxy palaeoecological study. The design of the field experiment (e.g., treatments), methodology and biogeographical setting are presented. We suggest it is beneficial to support field experiments with an investigation of past environmental changes in the studied ecosystem, as human impacts during the past 300 years have already caused substantial changes in ecosystem functioning which may condition the response in experimental studies.

AB Northern peatlands and permafrost soils are associated with large carbon stocks. Rising temperatures are likely to affect the carbon balance in high-latitude ecosystems, but to what degree is uncertain. We have enhanced the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model by introducing processes necessary to simulate permafrost dynamics, peatland hydrology, and peatland vegetation. The new version, LPJ-WHy v1.2, was used to study soil temperature, active layer depth, permafrost distribution, and water table position. Modeled soil temperatures agreed well with observations, apart from a Siberian site where the soil is insulated by an extensive shrub layer. Water table positions were generally in the range of observations, with some exceptions. Simulated active layer depth showed a mean absolute error of 44 cm when compared to observations, but the error was reduced to 25 cm when the soil type for seven sites was manually corrected to mirror local conditions. A sensitivity test, in which temperature and precipitation were varied independently, showed that soil temperatures and active layer depths increased more under higher temperatures when precipitation was increased at the same time. The sensitivity experiment suggested persisting wet conditions in peatlands even under temperature increases of up to 9 degrees C as long as annual precipitation is allowed to increase with temperature to the extent indicated by climate model experiments.

AB The mid-Holocene hydroclimates and the forcing mechanisms over arid Central Asia (ACA) are hotly debated in the context of global climate change. It is widely assumed that ACA Holocene precipitation broadly followed and/or was out-of-phase with Northern Hemisphere solar insolation. However, here we show a broadly antiphase relationship between Holocene boreal solar insolation and ACA hydroclimatic trend revealed from a well-dated peat core (at the Big Black peatland; BBP) in northwestern China, southern Altai Mountains. Multiple-proxies, including peat development rate, pollen assemblages, and peat cellulose isotopic records, show wet conditions during the early and late Holocene, but drought condition during the midHolocene. This hydroclimatic pattern is similar to those extracted from other peatlands nearby and those inferred from sedimentary records in lakes in adjacent regions. The trend of delta O-18 in BBP peat cellulose is similar to that of a stalagmite in northern Xinjiang, both of which record the Holocene atmospheric precipitation delta O-18 trend over ACA areas and possibly suggest a changing proportion of glacier meltwater supply. We speculate that the mid-Holocene drought over ACA could be ascribed to: (1) the northward movement of the westerlies, such that when the westerlies moved northward under warm conditions, less water vapor was transported to ACA, and vice versa, and (2) increased evaporation under mid-Holocene warm conditions. The data from this study and the potential mechanisms suggest that drier conditions are expected over ACA areas under a continuous global warming expectation.

AB As part of a wider project on European climate change over the past 4500 years, a 4.5-m peat core was taken from a lawn microform on Mannikjarve bog, Estonia. Several methods were used to yield proxy-climate data: (i) a quadrat and leaf-count method for plant macrofossil data, (ii) testate amoebae analysis, and (iii) colorimetric determination of peat humification. These data are provided with an exceptionally high resolution and precise chronology. Changes in bog surface wetness were inferred using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and zonation of macrofossil data, particularly concerning the occurrence of Sphagnum balticum, and a transfer function for water-table depth for testate amoebae data. Based on the results, periods of high bog surface wetness appear to have occurred at c. 3100, 3010-2990, 2300, 1750-1610, 1510, 14 10, 1110, 540 and 3 10 cal. yr BP, during four longer periods between c. 3170 and 2850 cal. yr BP, 2450 and 2000 cal. yr BP, 1770 and 1530 cal. yr BP and in the period from 880 cal. yr BP until the present. In the period between 1770 and 1530 cal. yr BP. the extension or initiation of a hollow microtope occurred, which corresponds with other research results from Mannikjarve bog. This and other changes towards increasing bog surface wetness may be the responses to colder temperatures and the predominance of a more continental climate in the region, which favoured the development of bog microdepressions and a complex bog microtopography. Located in the border zone of oceanic and continental climatic sectors, in an area almost without land uplift, this study site may provide valuable information about changes in palaeohydrological and palaeoclimatological conditions in the northern parts of the eastern Baltic Sea region.

   Implication for climate change?
SO GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY

DT Article
ID SUBFOSSIL PINE; TEMPERATURE
AB A dendrochronological study was made on fossil tree trunks of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris, preserved in a pear bog at Hanvedsmossen, 50 km SW of Stockholm, Sweden. Of 56 sampled pines, 48 were assembled in a 204-year long floating chronology. The chronology spans 1686-1483 Be +/- 23 years. The trunks are found at the very bottom of the pear accumulation. Because the roots stand in underlying clay, the tree stand germinated before or simultaneously with bog growth and provides maximum age for bog vegetation development which started c. 1480 Be. The pine growth steadily decreased during the last 30 years of the chronology and most trees died during the same period. It is proposed that the drainage outlets from Hanvedsmossen overgrew with brushwood simultaneously with the succession of pines, resulting in a higher sensitivity of tree growth to small changes in water levels. The preservation of the logs is suggested to be a re suit of a raised water table providing anaerobic conditions and later the logs were enveloped by peat growth. It is suggested that this period was the initial phase of the ensuing climate deterioration. The climate shifted to wetter conditions, i.e, higher amounts of precipitation, lower temperature or bath. This resulted in lower evaporation giving additional peat bog growth and a locally raised water table.

AB In this study, a suite of complementary environmental geochemical analyses, including NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of central metabolites, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) of secondary metabolites, and lipidomics, was used to investigate the influence of organic matter (OM) quality on the heterotrophic microbial mechanisms controlling peatland CO2, CH4, and CO2:CH4 porewater production ratios in response to climate warming. Our investigations leverage the Spruce and Peatland Responses under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment, where air and peat warming were combined in a whole-ecosystem warming treatment. We hypothesized that warming would enhance the production of plant-derived metabolites, resulting in increased labile OM inputs to the surface peat, thereby enhancing microbial activity and greenhouse gas production. Because shallow peat is most susceptible to enhanced warming, increases in labile OM inputs to the surface, in particular, are likely to result in significant changes to CO2 and CH4 dynamics and methanogenic pathways. In support of this hypothesis, significant correlations were observed between metabolites and temperature consistent with increased availability of labile substrates, which may stimulate more rapid turnover of microbial proteins. An increase in the abundance of methanogenic genes in response to the increase in the abundance of labile substrates was accompanied by a shift toward acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogenesis. Our results suggest that as peatland vegetation trends toward increasing vascular plant cover with warming, we can expect a concomitant shift toward increasingly methanogenic conditions and amplified climate-peatland feedbacks.

AB The patterned microtopography of subarctic mires generates a variety of environmental conditions, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) dynamics vary spatially among different plant community types (PCTs). We studied the CO2 and CH4 exchange between a subarctic fen and the atmosphere at Kaamanen in northern Finland based on flux chamber and eddy covariance measurements in 2017-2018. We observed strong spatial variation in carbon dynamics between the four main PCTs studied, which were largely controlled by water table level and differences in vegetation composition. The ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary productivity (GPP) increased gradually from the wettest PCT to the drier ones, and both ER and GPP were larger for all PCTs during the warmer and drier growing season 2018. We estimated that in 2017 the growing season CO2 balances of the PCTs ranged from -20 g C m(-2) (Trichophorum tussock PCT) to 64 g C m(-2) (string margin PCT), while in 2018 all PCTs were small CO2 sources (10-22 g C m(-2)). We observed small growing season CH4 emissions (< 1 g C m -2 ) from the driest PCT, while the other three PCTs had significantly larger emissions (mean 7.9, range 5.6-10.1 g C m(-2)) during the two growing seasons. Compared to the annual CO2 balance (-8.5 +/- 4.0 g C m(-2)) of the fen in 2017, in 2018 the annual balance (-5.6 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2)) was affected by an earlier onset of photosynthesis in spring, which increased the CO2 sink, and a drought event during summer, which decreased the sink. The CH4 emissions were also affected by the drought. The annual CH4 balance of the fen was 7.3 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) in 2017 and 6.2 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) in 2018. Thus, the carbon balance of the fen was close to zero in both years. The PCTs that were adapted to drier conditions provided ecosystem-level resilience to carbon loss due to water level drawdown.

AB Boreal forest and tundra are the biomes expected to experience the greatest warming during the course of the next century. The transient responses of boreal peatlands to climate change could be more complex than a simple large release of carbon and rapid migrations of vegetation and permafrost. Here we used alternative models to demonstrate that local processes typical of permafrost peatlands control carbon and vegetation dynamics in ways that strongly mediate effects of regional temperature gradients. Regional temperature affected stability and thaw rate. Thaw rate increased with mean annual temperature, and rates have accelerated within the last 50 yr. Local factors exerted a strong; influence on stability, the levels of which were highest in three of the four temperature zones studied along the shaded south-southwest edges of collapse scars. The presence of Sphagnum fuscum cover increased stability. In all zones, survey points with S. fuscum showed more than twice the stability of points with feather moss, lichen, or no vegetation. In a direct model comparison between regional and local control, local factors were more important. Our results suggest that local processes mediate the effects of regional climate, and an accurate representation of ecosystem dynamics benefits from both local and regional processes.

AB Isoprene emission from Sphagnum species naturally growing at different positions above the water table were measured in a subarctic peatland and at monoliths from a temperate bog. Our objectives were to investigate (1) whether emission rates were species and/or moisture dependent, and (2) whether short-term temperature history had an influence on emission capacity. We expected greater emission capacities in moist than dry growing conditions, and from species adapted to wet habitats. We also expected that higher emission capacities would be found in response to elevated temperatures. Average peak growing season isoprene emission capacities (standardized to 20 degrees C and PAR 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) at the subarctic site were 106 and 74 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) from a S. balticum wet lawn and a S. balticum dry hummock/palsa, respectively. Emission capacities correlated strongly with gross primary productivity (GPP) and the average air temperature of the 48 hours prior to measurement (T-48), but the effect of T-48 seemed to be partly masked by the influence of GPP when moisture was not limiting. The laboratory experiments suggested that a typical hummock species, S. rubellum had higher capacity for isoprene emission than a typical lawn species S. magellanicum. Instantaneous emission rates increased with temperature, but no effect of temperature history was discernible. Sphagnum mosses are known to emit substantial amounts of isoprene, but in this study we also showed significant inter-species differences in emission capacity. The results imply that climate change induced alterations of peatland hydrology may change the total ecosystem isoprene source strength, as individual species adapt to new growth conditions or as a consequence of species succession.

AB Our objective was to assess the impacts of water table position and plant functional groups on peatland extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) framed within the context of the enzymic latch hypothesis.
   We utilized a full factorial experiment with 2 water table (WT) treatments (high and low) and 3 plant functional groups (PFG: Ericaceae, sedge, Ericaceae and sedge unmanipulated) in twenty-four 1 m(3) intact peatland mesocosms. We measured bulk peat and porewater phase oxidative and hydrolytic enzyme activities monthly from June - October 2012. We also measured physical and porewater chemical constituents in tandem to analyze environmental influences on seasonal enzyme activities.
   No PFG effects on EEA with WT affecting only acid-phosphatase activity in porewater. Strong seasonal dynamics in EEAs overshadowed our manipulations. Analyses indicated phenolic concentrations were influenced by peat redox potential and negatively correlated with phenol oxidase activity as expected from enzymic latch hypothesis. However, no hydrolytic EEA was influenced by total phenolics, but driven largely by seasonal changes in soil temperature and increasing DOC concentrations in porewater.
   Our results suggest no support for final step in enzymic latch, in which phenolics are posited to regulate hydrolytic EEAs. Mechanisms regulating seasonal influences remain to be elucidated.

AB Floristic studies indicate the abundance of microalgae in northern boreal peatlands, but we know relatively little about their ecology or how they will respond to changes in environmental conditions expected in this region as climate changes. We examined changes in algal community structure at sites exposed to a long-term water-table manipulation, including drought (lowered water-table treatment), flooding (raised water-table treatment), and control (no manipulation) treatments in an Alaskan fen. In previous years, continuous algal colonization typically would have occurred only in the raised water-table treatment, but a spring flood inundated experimental plots and provided a unique opportunity to examine algal community response to rewetting after long-term drought. This event allowed us to investigate how much ecosystem memory of the antecedent water-table manipulations regulated the ability of taxa to recolonize sites after prolonged drought compared to sites that had been continuously flooded. Despite no differences in water-table position among treatments at the time of sampling, surface-water nutrient concentrations were higher in the lowered water-table treatment relative to the other treatments after the spring thaw. This difference corresponded with greater algal abundance and biovolume in the lowered water-table treatment relative to the control and raised water-table treatments. Higher abundance and biovolume was driven mainly by filamentous green algae (Chlorophyta), especially Oedogonium, Spirogyra, and Microspora. Diatoms were most abundant in the raised water-table treatment, whereas chrysophytes were most abundant in the control treatment. Across all water-table treatments, N-fixing cyanobacteria increased as nutrients and water-table position declined over time. The differences in algal community structure among water-table treatments suggest that alternating drought and flooding events expected with climate change may significantly alter algal-driven functions in boreal wetlands.

AB For policy making and spatial planning, information is needed about the impacts of climate change on natural ecosystems. To provide this information, commonly hydrological and ecological models are used. We give arguments for our assessment that modelling only is insufficient for determining the impacts of climate changes on natural ecosystems at regional scales. Instead, we proposed a combination of hydrological simulations, a literature review and process-knowledge on climate-hydrology-vegetation interactions, to compile a sketch map that indicates climate change effects on a number of ecosystems in the Netherlands. Soon after a first version of our sketch map was published by a Dutch professional journal, copies appeared in policy documents, and also in a commercial and popular atlas of the Netherlands. Moreover, the map led to a question in the Dutch parliament about the sustainability of bog reserves under the future climate. Apparently, there was an urgent need for the information provided by the map.
   The map shows that climate change will presumably have the largest influence on ecosystems in the Netherlands that depend on precipitation as the major water source, like heathlands, dry grasslands, rain-fed moorland pools and raised bogs. Also highly susceptible are fens in reserves surrounded by deeply drained polders, because such fens depend on the inlet of surface water, of which quality is likely to deteriorate upon climate change. While the map is indicative for directions of change, in view of the uncertainties of our study, no conclusions should be drawn that may have far-reaching consequences, such as giving up certain nature targets that might no longer be feasible in the future climate. Instead, we advise to anticipate the potential threats from climate change by taking a number of adaptation measures that enhance the robustness of nature reserves.
   To improve climate change projections on hydrology and ecosystems, future research should especially focus on feedbacks of vegetation on the water balance, on processes that directly influence plant performance and on the ecological effects of weather extremes.

AB Peatlands in permafrost region are large carbon pools sensitive to global warming. However, the effects of increased temperature on carbon emissions and associated microbial abundances of peatlands under anaerobic condition remain largely unknown, especially when considering depths. For supplementing the deficiency about this, we collected soil from 0 to 150 cm depth of a permafrost peatland in the Great Hing'an Mountain and incubated at 5 and 15 degrees C for 55 days under anaerobic condition. Soil CO2 and CH4 emissions were detected during incubation, and inorganic nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and carbon-cycling microbial abundances were analyzed at the end of incubation. Results showed that emission rates and cumulative emissions amount of CO2 and CH4 at 15 degrees C across all soil depths were higher than those observed at 5 degrees C. Specifically, 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm layers had the highest CO2 emission rates and cumulative emission amounts, whereas the 40-60 cm and 60-80 cm layers had the highest CH4 emission rates and cumulative emission amounts. Mean temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) values of CO2 and CH(4 )were 2.39 and 55.49 respectively. Q(10) values of bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, and methanotroph abundances were 1.17, 3.85, 1.75, 1.68, and 1.66 respectively, which were calculated by the abundance ratio of microbial functional gene at 15 degrees C and 5 degrees C. Similar to the trend of CO2 emissions, high bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, and methanotroph functional gene abundances were also observed in 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm layers, and such abundances increased along with temperature increasing. In sum, elevated temperature enhances the carbon emission of peatland in permafrost region, and the warming simulated CO2 emission is linked to the abundances of carbon-cycling microorganisms.

AB The production and release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat soils is thought to be sensitive to changes in climate, specifically changes in temperature and rainfall. However, little is known about the actual rates of net DOC production in response to temperature and water table draw-down, particularly in comparison to carbon dioxide (CO(2)) fluxes. To explore these relationships, we carried out a laboratory experiment on intact peat soil cores under controlled temperature and water table conditions to determine the impact and interaction of each of these climatic factors on net DOC production. We found a significant interaction (P < 0.001) between temperature, water table draw-down and net DOC production across the whole soil core (0 to -55 cm depth). This corresponded to an increase in the Q(10) (i.e. rise in the rate of net DOC production over a 10 degrees C range) from 1.84 under high water tables and anaerobic conditions to 3.53 under water table draw-down and aerobic conditions between -10 and - 40 cm depth. However, increases in net DOC production were only seen after water tables recovered to the surface as secondary changes in soil water chemistry driven by sulphur redox reactions decreased DOC solubility, and therefore DOC concentrations, during periods of water table draw-down. Furthermore, net microbial consumption of DOC was also apparent at - 1 cm depth and was an additional cause of declining DOC concentrations during dry periods. Therefore, although increased temperature and decreased rainfall could have a significant effect on net DOC release from peatlands, these climatic effects could be masked by other factors controlling the biological consumption of DOC in addition to soil water chemistry and DOC solubility. These findings highlight both the sensitivity of DOC release from ombrotrophic peat to episodic changes in water table draw-down, and the need to disentangle complex and interacting controls on DOC dynamics to fully understand the impact of environmental change on this system.

AB Mountains contain many small and fragmented peatlands within watersheds. As they are difficult to monitor, their role in the water and carbon cycle is often disregarded. This study aims to assess the stream organic carbon exports from a montane peatland and characterizes its contribution to the water chemistry in a headstream watershed. High frequency in situ monitoring of turbidity and fDOM were used to quantify respectively particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports at the inlet and outlet of a peatland over three years in a French Pyrenean watershed (1,343 m.a.s.l.). The DOC and POC signals are both highly dynamic, characterized by numerous short peaks lasting from a few hours to a few days. Forty-six percent of the exports occurred during 9% of the time corresponding to the highest flows monitored at the outlet. Despite its small area (3%) within the watershed, the peatland contributes at least 63% of the DOC export at the outlet. The specific DOC flux ranges from 16.1 +/- 0.4 to 34.6 +/- 1.5 g m(2) year(-1). POC contributes 17% of the total stream organic carbon exports from the watershed. As the frequency of extreme climatic events is expected to increase in the context of climate change, further studies should be conducted to understand the evolution of underestimated mountainous peatland carbon fluxes and their implication in the carbon cycle of headwaters.

AB At the millennial scale bog surface wetness (BSW) records show a clear Holocene climate event stratigraphy, with major phases comparable with other regional climate proxies such as chironomid inferred temperature records. Moving towards the centennial scale, however, and towards the limits of chronological certainty within the records, regional differences are apparent which likely reflect the more heterogeneous precipitation patterns which occur on shorter timescales. The BSW data presented in this paper are reconstructed from testate amoebae assemblages from central Ireland and are compared with other regional records. The results suggest that this region is in phase with the North of Ireland in terms of timings and durations of climate change, but the comparisons are less clear with a stacked and tuned record from Northern Britain that shows an apparent offset compared to the Irish records. This may reflect variations in past regional precipitation or be a function of the tuning and stacking process. The broad phases of comparison between the Irish records, and the extension of the central Irish record back to 6000 cal BP, allow comparisons with low frequency temperature reconstructions from chironomids, which also show a broad level of correlation, with cooler temperatures relating to wetter BSW at centennial to millennial timescales.

AB Across Canada's boreal forest, linear disturbances, including cutlines such as seismic lines and roads, crisscross the landscape to facilitate resource exploration and extraction; many of these linear disturbances cross peatland ecosystems. Changes in tree canopy cover and the compression of the peat by heavy equipment alter local thermal, hydrological, and ecological conditions, likely changing carbon exchange on the disturbance, and possibly in the adjacent peatland. We measured bulk density, water table, soil temperature, plant cover, and CO2 and CH4 flux along triplicate transects crossing a winter road through a wooded fen near Peace River, Alberta, Canada. Sample plots were located 1, 5, and 10 m from the road on both sides with an additional three plots on the road. Productivity of the overstory trees, when present, was also determined. The winter road had higher bulk density, shallower water table, higher graminoid cover, and thawed earlier than the adjacent peatland. Tree productivity and CO2 flux varied between the plots, and there was no clear pattern in relation to distance from the road. The plots on the winter road acted as a greater CO2 sink and greater CH4 source compared to the adjacent peatland with plots on the winter road emitting on average (standard error) 479 (138) compared to 41 (10) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in the adjacent peatland. Considering both gases, global warming potential increased from 70 to 250 g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1) in the undisturbed area to 2100 g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1) on the winter road. Although carbon fluxes on any given cutline through peatland will vary depending on level of compaction, line width and vegetation community shifts, the large number of linear disturbances in Canada's boreal forest and slow recovery on peatland ecosites suggest they could represent an important anthropogenic greenhouse gas source.

AB The effect of episodic drought on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in peatlands has been the subject of considerable debate, as decomposition and DOC production is thought to increase under aerobic conditions, yet decreased DOC concentrations have been observed during drought periods. Decreased DOC solubility due to drought-induced acidification driven by sulphur (S) redox reactions has been proposed as a causal mechanism; however evidence is based on a limited number of studies carried out at a few sites. To test this hypothesis on a range of different peats, we carried out controlled drought simulation experiments on peat cores collected from six sites across Great Britain. Our data show a concurrent increase in sulphate (SO4) and a decrease in DOC across all sites during simulated water table draw-down, although the magnitude of the relationship between SO4 and DOC differed between sites. Instead, we found a consistent relationship across all sites between DOC decrease and acidification measured by the pore water acid neutralising capacity (ANC). ANC provided a more consistent measure of drought-induced acidification than SO4 alone because it accounts for differences in base cation and acid anions concentrations between sites. Rewetting resulted in rapid DOC increases without a concurrent increase in soil respiration, suggesting DOC changes were primarily controlled by soil acidity not soil biota. These results highlight the need for an integrated analysis of hydrologically driven chemical and biological processes in peatlands to improve our understanding and ability to predict the interaction between atmospheric pollution and changing climatic conditions from plot to regional and global scales.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes in boreal peatlands could be impacted by global warming and N deposition. However, the interaction of these factors remains poorly understood and has not been considered in coupled climate-carbon models. In this study, manipulated warming and N deposition (ammonium nitrate) were conducted for five years in a coastal bog in western Newfoundland, Canada. Consistent with previous studies, warming significantly increased CH4 emission by 52%, which might be due to the increase of microbial activity and vegetation growth. Although N addition alone did not alter CH4 emissions, it significantly reduced the positive effect of warming on CH4 fluxes. We attributed this finding to three possible reasons: (1) N addition caused a shift in root allocation from deep to shallow roots, which decreased labile substrates for CH4 production under warming; (2) warming promoted vegetation uptake of ammonium (NH4+), which alleviated the inhibition of NH4+ to methanotrophs and subsequently increased CH4 oxidation under N addition; and (3) the combination of warming and N addition increased maintenance respiration of vascular plants compared with warming alone, thus reducing net primary production and root exudates for CH4 production. In addition, we found that soil temperature, soil moisture, DOC and TN were the main controls on CH4 fluxes. Our results indicate that the combined effect of N deposition and warming should not be ignored. Otherwise, the emission of CH4 in bogs will be overestimated under future scenarios of climate warming and N deposition increase. Our study can be further applied as empirical evidence for the parameterization of temperature-dependence and nutrient-dependence of CH4 fluxes in biogeochemical models of boreal peatlands.

AB Unveiling past tipping points is a prerequisite for a better understanding of how individual species and entire ecosystems will respond to future climate change. Such knowledge is key for the implementation of biodiversity conservation. We identify the relationships between peatland vegetation and hydrological conditions over the past 2000 years using plant macrofossils, testate amoebae-based quantitative hydrological reconstructions and Sphagnum-moss functional traits from seven Polish peatland records. Using threshold indicator taxa analysis, we discovered that plant community composition strongly converged at a water level of ca 11.7 cm, indicating a community-level tipping point. We identified 45 plant taxa that showed either an increase or a decrease in their relative abundance between 8 and 17 cm of water-level depth. Our analysis of Sphagnum community traits further showed that Sphagnum functional diversity was remarkably stable over time despite Sphagnum species sensitivity to hydrological conditions. Our results suggest that past hydrological shifts did not influence major functions of the Sphagnum community, such as photosynthetic capacity, growth and productivity, owing to species replacement with a similar functional space. Although further studies including trait plasticity will be required, our findings suggest that the capacity of the Sphagnum community to gain carbon remained stable despite hydrological changes.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle as they contain a large soil carbon stock. However, current climate change could potentially shift peatlands from being carbon sinks to carbon sources. Remote sensing methods provide an opportunity to monitor carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange in peatland ecosystems at large scales under these changing conditions. In this study, we developed empirical models of the CO2 balance (net ecosystem exchange, NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (ER) that could be used for upscaling CO2 fluxes with remotely sensed data. Two to three years of eddy covariance (EC) data from five peatlands in Sweden and Finland were compared to modelled NEE, GPP and ER based on vegetation indices from 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 MSI and land surface temperature from 1 km resolution MODIS data. To ensure a precise match between the EC data and the Sentinel-2 observations, a footprint model was applied to derive footprint-weighted daily means of the vegetation indices. Average model parameters for all sites were acquired with a leave-one-out-cross-validation procedure. Both the GPP and the ER models gave high agreement with the EC-derived fluxes (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.56, NRMSE = 14% and 15%, respectively). The performance of the NEE model was weaker (average R-2 = 0.36 and NRMSE = 13%). Our findings demonstrate that using optical and thermal satellite sensor data is a feasible method for upscaling the GPP and ER of northern boreal peatlands, although further studies are needed to investigate the sources of the unexplained spatial and temporal variation of the CO2 fluxes.

TI Solar cycles or random processes? Evaluating solar variability in
   Holocene climate records
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID NORTH-ATLANTIC; PROXY DATA; PEAT BOGS; NETHERLANDS; IMPACT; SUN
AB Many studies have reported evidence for solar-forcing of Holocene climate change across a range of archives. These studies have compared proxy-climate data with records of solar variability (e.g. C-14 or Be-10), or have used time series analysis to test for the presence of solar-type cycles. This has led to some climate sceptics misrepresenting this literature to argue strongly that solar variability drove the rapid global temperature increase of the twentieth century. As proxy records underpin our understanding of the long-term processes governing climate, they need to be evaluated thoroughly. The peatland archive has become a prominent line of evidence for solar forcing of climate. Here we examine high-resolution peatland proxy climate data to determine whether solar signals are present. We find a wide range of significant periodicities similar to those in records of solar variability: periods between 40-100 years, and 120-140 years are particularly common. However, periodicities similar to those in the data are commonly found in random-walk simulations. Our results demonstrate that solar-type signals can be the product of random variations alone, and that a more critical approach is required for their robust interpretation.

AB Alterations in snow cover driven by climate change may impact ecosystem functioning, including biogeochemistry and soil (microbial) processes. We elucidated the effects of snow cover manipulation (SCM) on above-and belowground processes in a temperate peatland.
   In a Swiss mountain-peatland we manipulated snow cover (addition, removal and control), and assessed the effects on Andromeda polifolia root enzyme activity, soil microbial community structure, and leaf tissue and soil biogeochemistry.
   Reduced snow cover produced warmer soils in our experiment while increased snow cover kept soil temperatures close-to-freezing. SCM had a major influence on the microbial community, and prolonged 'close-to-freezing' temperatures caused a shift in microbial communities toward fungal dominance. Soil temperature largely explained soil microbial structure, while other descriptors such as root enzyme activity and pore-water chemistry interacted less with the soil microbial communities.
   We envisage that SCM-driven changes in the microbial community composition could lead to substantial changes in trophic fluxes and associated ecosystem processes. Hence, we need to improve our understanding on the impact of frost and freeze-thaw cycles on the microbial food web and its implications for peatland ecosystem processes in a changing climate; in particular for the fate of the sequestered carbon.

AB Even though large extents of boreal peatlands are still in a pristine condition, especially in North America, extensive areas have been affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances that change some of the systems from being sinks to sources of carbon dioxide and shift the methane production/consumption patterns through alterations of both above- and below-ground communities and functions. In order to fully assess the role of peatlands on global C balance, now and in the future, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of the relative contributions of various groups of microorganisms to organic matter transformations. Here, we review the drivers structuring fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in natural peatlands and the response of these microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, drainage, nutrient deposition, peat mining and climate change. The microbial diversity in peatlands is characterized by organisms that have developed physiological and metabolic adaptations to cope with the constraining conditions found in these ecosystems, such as low oxygen availability, cold temperature, acidity and oligotrophy. Furthermore, these unique organisms sometimes appear to be organized as repeat mosaics responding to vegetation, physicochemical and hydrological characteristics more than to geographical distance, in other words, similar to the much valued biodiversity aspects of the peatland vegetation itself and associated higher organisms. The response of microbial communities to disturbances is far from fully understood. In particular, whilst many studies have identified changes in microbial community composition or on microbially driven processes following a given disturbance, it remains unclear how the two components, diversity and function, relate with each other. Future challenges involve designing studies that will test whether ecological theories like species sorting, stress physiology, temporal niche or functional redundancy can be used to understand what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatlands, and studies that will allow us to predict more accurately how peatlands respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Peatland ecosystems contain one-third of the world's soil carbon store and many have been exposed to drought leading to a loss of carbon. Understanding biogeochemical mechanisms affecting decomposition in peatlands is essential for improving resilience of ecosystem function to predicted climate change. We investigated biogeochemical changes along a chronosequence of hydrological restoration (dry eroded gully, drain-blocked < 2 years, drain blocked < 7 years and wet pristine site), and examined whether hydrological legacy alters the response of beta-glucosidase kinetics (i.e. type of inhibition) to short-term drying and waterlogging. In the dry eroded gully at depth, low phenolic concentrations were associated with enhanced beta-glucosidase enzyme activities (V-max) but short-term drying and waterlogging caused a significant increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phenolics associated with increases in Vmax (enzyme production) and Km (indicative of competitive inhibition). Inhibition within the drain blocked and pristine sites at depth exhibited non-competitive inhibition (decreased Vmax), whilst uncompetitive inhibition (decreased Vmax and Km) occurred in surface peat explained by variation in humic substances and phenolics. These results suggest that loss of carbon by short-term drought or rewetting may occur from sites with a legacy of drought due to the release of non-inhibitory phenolics that permits enhanced enzyme activity.

AB Permafrost peatlands are important pools of soil carbon. Soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization and its temperature sensitivity in permafrost peatlands are crucial for predictions of soil carbon-climate feedback. However, little is known about the changes in SOC mineralization and its mechanism in response to environmental change in the permafrost peatlands of Northeastern China. We collected seven permafrost peatland soils from Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains in Northeastern China to investigate how the responses of microbes and labile substrates control the mineralization of SOC in the laboratory incubation study. The results show that temperature and sampling sites affected the mineralization of SOC. Elevated temperatures significantly increased the rate of carbon mineralization across the peatland soils. The mean sensitivity of SOC mineralization to temperature (Q(10) value) was 2.96. The increase in substrate availability and microbial abundance in parallel with the increase in temperature is responsible for the high rates of decomposition of the organic carbon pools. We found that the mineralization of soil carbon positively correlated with the concentrations of soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+-N, NO3--N, as well as the abundances of bacteria, fungi, methanotrophs and nirK denitrifiers. Moreover, the content of DOC positively correlated with the abundances of soil bacteria, methanotrophs and nirK denitrifiers, indicating that the influences of soil microbial abundances on carbon mineralization were strongly mediated by the availability of carbon substrates. Our findings provide novel insights into the effects of increasing temperatures on the relationship between microbial communities and labile substrates and their roles in carbon decomposition in permafrost peatlands.

AB Climate warming is expected to increasingly influence boreal peatlands and alter their greenhouse gases emissions. However, the effects of warming on N2O fluxes and the N2O budgets were ignored in boreal peatlands. Therefore, in a boreal peatland of permafrost zone in Northeast China, a simulated warming experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of warming on N2O fluxes in Betula. Fruticosa community (B. Fruticosa) and Ledum. palustre community (L. palustre) during the growing seasons from 2013 to 2015. Results showed that warming treatment increased air temperature at 1.5 m aboveground and soil temperature at 5 cm depth by 0.6 degrees C and 2 degrees C, respectively. The average seasonal N2O fluxes ranged from 6.62 to 9.34 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the warming plot and ranged from 0.41 to 4.55 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the control plots. Warming treatment increased N2O fluxes by 147% and transformed the boreal peatlands from a N2O sink to a source. The primary driving factors for N2O fluxes were soil temperature and active layer depth, whereas soil moisture showed a weak correlation with N2O fluxes. The results indicated that warming promoted N2O fluxes by increasing soil temperature and active layer depth in a boreal peatland of permafrost zone in Northeast China. Moreover, elevated N2O fluxes persisted in this region will potentially drive a noncarbon feedback to ongoing climate change. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change affects peatlands directly through increased air temperatures and indirectly through changes in water-table level (WL). The interactions of these two still remain poorly known. We determined experimentally the separate and interactive effects of temperature and WL regime on factors of relevance for the inputs to the carbon cycle: plant community composition, phenology, biomass production, and shoot:root allocation in two wet boreal sedge-dominated fens, southern at 62 degrees N and northern at 68 degrees N. Warming (1.5 degrees C higher average daily air temperature) was induced with open-top chambers and WL drawdown (WLD; 3-7cm on average) by shallow ditches. Total biomass production varied from 250 to 520 g/m(2), with belowground production comprising 25%-63%. Warming was associated with minor effects on phenology and negligible effects on community composition, biomass production, and allocation. WLD clearly affected the contribution of different plant functional types (PFTs) in the community and the biomass they produced: shrubs benefited while forbs and mosses suffered. These responses did not depend on the warming treatment. Following WLD, aboveground biomass production decreased mainly due to reduced growth of mosses in the southern fen. Aboveground vascular plant biomass production remained unchanged but the contribution of different PFTs changed. The observed changes were also reflected in plant phenology, with different PFTs showing different responses. Belowground production increased following WLD in the northern fen only, but an increase in the contributions of shrubs and forbs was observed in both sites, while sedge contribution decreased. Moderate warming alone seems not able to drive significant changes in plant productivity or community composition in these wet ecosystems. However, if warming is accompanied by even modest WL drawdown, changes should be expected in the relative contribution of PFTs, which could lead to profound changes in the function of fens. Consequently, hydrological scenarios are of utmost importance when estimating their future function.

AB Water stress can influence the ability of plants to tolerate and resist herbivory and indirectly mediate inset fitness. Larch casebearer, Coleophora laricella Hubner (Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae), is an invasive defoliator in North America where it infests eastern larch, Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch (Pinaceae). Anomalous outbreaks of larch casebearer have been detected each year since 2000 in Minnesota, USA. In Minnesota, eastern larch typically occurs in peatland bogs or fens with complex hydrology. Given the potential for global climate change to alter precipitation and the seasonal flooding dynamics of eastern larch stands, we investigated the role of simulated waterlogging and drought on eastern larch-larch casebearer interactions over twoyears. We quantified the growth, survival, and foliarmonoterpene concentrationsof juvenile eastern larches in response to varying watering regimens and challenge from larch casebearer. We also quantified how watering regimenand monoterpene concentrations affected the survival of fourth instar larch casebearersto adulthood. The growth and survival of eastern larch was negatively impacted by challenge from larch casebearer, waterlogging, and drought, though the strength of responses varied between years. The monoterpene concentrations ineastern larchfoliage did not change in response to water stress or challenge from larch casebearer but the within-year concentrations of several monoterpenes decreased with time. Noconsistent patterns emerged in the response of larch casebearer to watering regimen or monoterpenes. In summary, it appears thatwatering stress and defoliation do not interactto impact growth and survival of juvenile eastern larches, but rather act independently.

AB Canada's northern boreal forests are undergoing rapid change associated with warming trends, with permafrost thaw leading to increased forest stress and compositional changes in plant communities. Within this context, the influence of commonly occurring, resident natural enemies on plant species remains poorly understood. One of the dominant deciduous shrub genera, Betula, is abundant in northern forest-wetland landscapes, and is highly susceptible to leaf galling by mites, but the impacts of these specialist arthropod herbivores on plant-level physiology remain unknown. We examined the impacts of mite galling on a suite of ecophysiological traits in Betula glandulosa, a shrubby species commonly found on permafrost plateaus, bogs and fens in a boreal wetland-forest mosaic, and on two congeners, B.occidentalis and B.neoalaskana, found only on plateaus. B.glandulosa leaves on plateaus showed marked declines in photosynthetic capacity [Amax], stomatal conductance [gs], and transpiration [E] in response to galling. However, B.glandulosa leaves in bogs and fens did not respond similarly, implying strong habitat-related differences in response to galling herbivory. The impacts on plateaus were reinforced by similar responses of B.occidentalis and B.neoalaskana leaves to galling, and confirmed that on plateaus, galling appears to have significant negative effects on photosynthetic uptake. Moreover, carbon uptake in infested leaves showed photosynthetic declines even at low galling intensity. Interestingly, neighbouring nongalled leaves adjacent to galled ones showed similar declines in gas-exchange rates in all the three species found on plateaus. However, reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration in galled and neighbour leaves did not affect whole plant water status, as we found no differences in either midday or diurnal stem water potentials between galled and gall-free stems in any of the species. Synthesis: Based on these findings, we suggest that the impacts of mite galling are variable, and are likely to be most pronounced in habitats and on individuals that are already exposed to abiotic stresses such as the cooler, but more variable soil temperatures experienced by individuals on permafrost plateaus. Furthermore, galling can potentially contribute to localized thaw processes in these environments via impacts on plant functioning.

AB Northern peatlands in permafrost regions contain a large amount of organic carbon (C) in the soil. Climate warming and associated permafrost degradation are expected to have significant impacts on the C balance of these ecosystems, but the magnitude is uncertain. We incorporated a permafrost model, Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature (NEST), into a biogeochemical model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to model C dynamics in high-latitude peatland ecosystems. The enhanced model was applied to assess effects of permafrost thaw on C fluxes of a subarctic peatland at Stordalen, Sweden. DNDC simulated soil freeze-thaw dynamics, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), and CH4 fluxes across three typical land cover types, which represent a gradient in the process of ongoing permafrost thaw at Stordalen. Model results were compared with multiyear field measurements, and the validation indicates that DNDC was able to simulate observed differences in seasonal soil thaw, NEE, and CH4 fluxes across the three land cover types. Consistent with the results from field studies, the modeled C fluxes across the permafrost thaw gradient demonstrate that permafrost thaw and the associated changes in soil hydrology and vegetation not only increase net uptake of C from the atmosphere but also increase the annual to decadal radiative forcing impacts on climate due to increased CH4 emissions. This study indicates the potential of utilizing biogeochemical models, such as DNDC, to predict the soil thermal regime in permafrost areas and to investigate impacts of permafrost thaw on ecosystem C fluxes after incorporating a permafrost component into the model framework.

AB The potential impact of an increase in methane emissions from natural wetlands on climate change models could be very large. We report a profound increase in methane emissions from cores of mire peat and vegetation as a direct result of increasing the CO2 concentration from 355 to 550 mu mol mol(-1) (a 60% increase). Increased CH4 fluxes were observed throughout the four month period of study. Seasonal variation in CH4 flux, consistent with that seen in the field, was observed under both ambient and elevated CO2. Under ambient CO2 methane fluxes rose from 0.02 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in May to 0.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-3) in July before declining again in August. Under elevated CO2, methane fluxes were at least 100% greater throughout the experiment, rising from 0.05 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in May to a peak of 0.27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in July. The stimulation of CH4 emissions was accompanied by a 100% increase in rates of photosynthesis from 4.6 (+/- 0.3) under ambient CO2 to 9.3 (+/- 0.7) mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Root and shoot biomass were unaffected.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) inventories are important tools for studying the effects of land-use and climate change and evaluating climate-change policies. A detailed inventory of SOC in the agricultural soils of the federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg was therefore prepared based on the highest-resolution geo-referenced soil, land-use, and climate data (BUK200 inventory). In order to estimate the quality of different approaches, C inventories of the region were also prepared based on data from the National Inventory Report (UBA, 2003) and by applying the IPCC (1997) method to the two data sets. Finally, the BUK200 inventory was used to estimate potentials of no-tillage agriculture (NT) and peatland restoration to contribute to C sequestration and greenhouse-gas (GHG)-emission mitigation since both measures are discussed in this context. Scenario assumptions were change to NT on 40% of the cropland and restoration of 50% of cultivated peatlands within 20 years.
   On average, grasslands contained 9.5 kg C m(-2) to 0.3 m depth as compared to only 6.0 kg C m(-2) under cropland, indicating strong land-use effects. The SOC content depended strongly on waterlogging and elevation, thus reflecting reduced C mineralization under aquic moisture regimes and low temperatures. Comparison of the BUK200 inventory with the approach used for UBA (2003) showed high inconsistencies due to map resolution and SOC contents, whereas the IPCC method led to fairly good agreements. Results on the simulated effects of NT and peatland restoration suggested that 5%-14% of total agricultural GHG emissions could be abated with NT whereas peat restoration appeared to have a minor mitigation potential (0.2%-2.7%) because the total area of cultivated organic soils was too small to have larger impact.

AB Belowground climate change responses remain a key unknown in the Earth system. Plant fine-root response is especially important to understand because fine roots respond quickly to environmen-tal change, are responsible for nutrient and water uptake, and influence carbon cycling. However, fine-root responses to climate change are poorly constrained, especially in northern peatlands, which contain up to two-thirds of the world's soil carbon. We present fine-root responses to warming between +2 degrees C and 9 degrees C above ambient conditions in a whole-ecosystem peatland experi-ment. Warming strongly increased fine-root growth by over an order of magnitude in the warmest treatment, with stronger re-sponses in shrubs than in trees or graminoids. In the first year of treatment, the control (+0 degrees C) shrub fine-root growth of 0.9 km m(-2) y(-1) increased linearly by 1.2 km m(-2) y(-1) (130%) for every degree increase in soil temperature. An extended below -ground growing season accounted for 20% of this dramatic in-crease. In the second growing season of treatment, the shrub warming response rate increased to 2.54 km m(-2) degrees C-1. Soil mois-ture was negatively correlated with fine-root growth, highlighting that drying of these typically water-saturated ecosystems can fuel a surprising burst in shrub belowground productivity, one possible mechanism explaining the "shrubification" of northern peatlands in response to global change. This previously unrecognized mech-anism sheds light on how peatland fine-root response to warming and drying could be strong and rapid, with consequences for the belowground growing season duration, microtopography, vegetation composition, and ultimately, carbon function of these globally relevant carbon sinks.

AB It is expected that climate change will have a great impact on many species and habitats. This will be greater if populations are found at the edge of their range or are isolated, and could lead to regional extinction. Here we investigate the possible impact on two boreo-alpine dragonfly species, Somatochlora alpestris and S. arctica, at their range margins. Both species were unknown for most parts of south-eastern Europe. In 2007 we found 15 localities for S. alpestris and two for S. arctica in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. Both species are there confined to mountain peat bogs. All localities are situated between 1300 m and 2100 m altitude, with the majority restricted to a small range between 1600 m and 1800 m. Based on the factor altitude we predict a hypothetical distribution map for S. alpestris. The underlying models exclusively rely on the ultimate factor "altitude" and explain more than 60% of the deviance. In addition, we assessed the impact of climate change for two scenarios: a 1.5 degrees C temperature increase and a 3 degrees C increase. The first resulted in altitudinal range shifts of +200 m and in a distributional shrinkage of 40%, the latter corresponds to an upward range shift of 600 m and a loss of 90% of the area. Habitat specialists, especially those at their margins of distribution, are hardly able to keep pace with climate change. It seems unlikely that mountain peat bogs will develop at rates comparable to those of current climate change. This may effect regional extinctions of boreo-alpine species.

AB The role of algae in the metabolism of northern peatlands is largely unknown, as is how algae will respond to the rapid climate change being experienced in this region. In this study, we examined patterns in algal productivity, nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during an uncharacteristically wet summer in an Alaskan rich fen. Our sampling was conducted in three large-scale experimental plots where water table position had been manipulated (including both drying and wetting plots and a control) for the previous 4 years. This study allowed us to explore how much ecosystem memory of the antecedent water table manipulations governed algal responses to natural flooding. Despite no differences in water table position between the manipulated plots at the time of sampling, algal primary productivity was consistently higher in the lowered water table plot compared to the control or raised water table plots. In all plots, algal productivity peaked immediately following seasonal maxima in nutrient concentrations. We found a positive relationship between algal productivity and water-column DOC concentrations (r (2) = 0.85, P < 0.001). Using these data, we estimate that algae released approximately 19% of fixed carbon into the water column. Algal exudates were extremely labile in biodegradability assays, decreasing by more than 55% within the first 24 h of incubation. We suggest that algae can be an important component of the photosynthetic community in boreal peatlands and may become increasingly important for energy flow in a more variable climate with more intense droughts and flooding.

AB Extreme summer droughts are expected to occur more often in the future in NW Europe due to climate change. These droughts might accelerate the rate of peat oxidation in drained peat areas, with impacts on soil subsidence, GHG emission and water quality. This study aimed at providing more insight in the oxidation of deep peat layers that had not previously been exposed to air, the so-called secondary decomposition.
   We incubated two types of peat (eutrophic and oligotrophic), sampled from permanently anoxic peat layers from nature reserves and agricultural peat meadows. Peat samples were incubated for thirteen weeks under anoxic conditions, but were exposed to air for one to eight weeks. The production of CO2 and CH4 was quantified as a proxy for decomposition; concentrations of soluble nutrients and phenolic compounds were also measured.
   The results showed that oxygenation led to a steep increase in the rate of decomposition, indicated by higher carbon loss rates during and after oxygenation compared to non-oxygenated samples. Carbon loss rates increased more for eutrophic peat (agricultural area: 352%, nature reserve: 182%) than for oligotrophic peat (83% and 159% respectively). Most peat samples investigated showed higher post-oxygenation CO2 and/or CH4 production compared to the anoxic pre-oxygenation period. This indicates that oxygenation stimulates decomposition, even after anoxic conditions have returned. Contrary to the enzymic latch theory, no effects of oxygenation on the concentrations of soluble or condensed phenolic compounds were detected. Soluble nutrient concentrations did not change due to oxygenation either. Noteworthy is the occurrence of pyrite mineralization and associated acidification in eutrophic peat. Thus, low summer water levels, for example due to climate change, should be avoided in order to limit exceptionally high decomposition rates and associated problems such as increasing subsidence rates, greenhouse gas emission, sulfate release and acidification.

AB With rapid climate warming, ecosystems will probably exhibit complex dynamics because local factors and life history attributes of species mediate the effects of regional climate change. To assess the relative importance of local vs. regional processes on permafrost formation in boreal peatlands, I sampled for permafrost and factors affecting its formation in 38 collapse scars across a 4 degrees C mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient in the discontinuous permafrost zone of northern Manitoba, Canada. Three complimentary approaches were used to model factors important to permafrost formation at both local and regional scales. In the first analysis, a mechanistic, spatial model of permafrost formation was developed as a function of Picea mariana size and proximity. In the second approach, permafrost formation was modelled as a function of two local factors, diameter of Picea mariana trees and emergent organic matter depth, and the regional factor, mean annual temperature (MAT). Finally, published aerial photography data were used to determine whether the proportion of bogs with permafrost changes across a MAT gradient. Results show that permafrost formation in boreal permafrost peatlands is best described as a locally driven process within regional climatic constraints. At local scales of 1-2 meters, the spatial and size distributions of trees controlled the spatial distribution of permafrost. At regional scales, tree size was a significantly better predictor than emergent organic matter or MAT. These results suggest that transient models of discontinuous permafrost based only on climate may poorly predict changes in vegetation and permafrost.

AB Pristine peatlands are carbon (C)-accumulating wetland ecosystems sustained by a high water table (WT) and consequent anoxia that slows down decomposition. Persistent WT drawdown as a response to climate and/or land-use change affects decomposition either directly through environmental factors such as increased oxygenation, or indirectly through changes in plant community composition. This study attempts to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of WT drawdown by measuring the relative importance of environmental parameters (WT depth, temperature, soil chemistry) and litter type and/or litter chemical quality on the 2-year decomposition rates of above- and belowground litter (altogether 39 litter types). Consequences for organic matter accumulation were estimated based on the annual litter production. The study sites were chosen to form a three-stage chronosequence from pristine (undrained) to short-term (years) and long-term (decades) WT drawdown conditions at three nutrient regimes. The direct effects of WT drawdown were overruled by the indirect effects through changes in litter type composition and production. Short-term responses to WT drawdown were small. In long-term, dramatically increased litter inputs resulted in large accumulation of organic matter in spite of increased decomposition rates. Furthermore, the quality of the accumulated matter greatly changed from that accumulated in pristine conditions. Our results show that the shift in vegetation composition as a response to climate and/or land-use change is the main factor affecting peatland ecosystem C cycle, and thus dynamic vegetation is a necessity in any model applied for estimating responses of C fluxes to changing environment. We provide possible grouping of litter types into plant functional types that the models could utilize. Furthermore, our results clearly show a drop in soil summer temperature as a response to WT drawdown when an initially open peatland converts into a forest ecosystem, which has not yet been considered in the existing models.

AB Northern boreal forests are characterized by accumulation of accumulation of peat (e.g., known as paludification). The functioning of northern boreal forest species and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes appear to depend on soil conditions. Climate warming is expected to have particularly pronounced effects on paludified boreal ecosystems and can alter current forest species composition and adaptation by changing soil conditions such as moisture, temperature regimes, and soil respiration. In this paper, we review and synthesize results from various reported studies (i.e., 88 research articles cited hereafter) to assess the effects of climatic warming on soil conditions of paludified forests in North America. Predictions that global warming may increase the decomposition rate must be considered in combination with its impact on soil moisture, which appears to be a limiting factor. Local adaptation or acclimation to current climatic conditions is occurring in boreal forests, which is likely to be important for continued ecosystem stability in the context of climate change. The most commonly cited response of boreal forest species to global warming is a northward migration that tracks the climate and soil conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) to which they are adapted. Yet, some constraints may influence this kind of adaptation, such as water availability, changes in fire regimes, decomposer adaptations, and the dynamic of peat accumulation. In this paper, as a study case, we examined an example of potential effects of climatic warming on future paludification changes in the eastern lowland region of Canada through three different combined hypothetical scenarios based on temperature and precipitation (e.g., unchanged, increase, or decrease). An increase scenario in precipitation will likely favor peat accumulation in boreal forest stands prone to paludification and facilitate forested peatland expansion into upland forest, while decreased or unchanged precipitation combined with an increase in temperature will probably favor succession of forested peatlands to upland boreal forests. Each of the three scenarios were discussed in this study, and consequent silvicultural treatment options were suggested for each scenario to cope with anticipated soil and species changes in the boreal forests. We concluded that, despite the fact boreal soils will not constrain adaptation of boreal forests, some consequences of climatic warming may reduce the ability of certain species to respond to natural disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks, and extreme weather events.

TI Forecasting the development of boreal paludified forests in response to

AB Background: Successional paludification, a dynamic process that leads to the formation of peatlands, is influenced by climatic factors and site features such as surficial deposits and soil texture. In boreal regions, projected climate change and corresponding modifications in natural fire regimes are expected to influence the paludification process and forest development. The objective of this study was to forecast the development of boreal paludified forests in northeastern North America in relation to climate change and modifications in the natural fire regime for the period 2011-2100.
   Methods: A paludification index was built using static (e.g. surficial deposits and soil texture) and dynamic (e.g. moisture regime and soil organic layer thickness) stand scale factors available from forest maps. The index considered the effects of three temperature increase scenarios (i.e. + 1 degrees C, + 3 degrees C and + 6 degrees C) and progressively decreasing fire cycle (from 300 years for 2011-2041, to 200 years for 2071-2100) on peat accumulation rate and soil organic layer (SOL) thickness at the stand level, and paludification at the landscape level.
   Results: Our index show that in the context where in the absence of fire the landscape continues to paludify, the negative effect of climate change on peat accumulation resulted in little modification to SOL thickness at the stand level, and no change in the paludification level of the study area between 2011 and 2100. However, including decreasing fire cycle to the index resulted in declines in paludified area. Overall, the index predicts a slight to moderate decrease in the area covered by paludified forests in 2100, with slower rates of paludification.
   Conclusions: Slower paludification rates imply greater forest productivity and a greater potential for forest harvest, but also a gradual loss of open paludified stands, which could impact the carbon balance in paludified landscapes. Nonetheless, as the thick Sphagnum layer typical of paludified forests may protect soil organic layer from drought and deep burns, a significant proportion of the territory has high potential to remain a carbon sink.

TI Impact of climate change on wetland ecosystems: A critical review of
   experimental wetlands
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Review
DE Climate chamber; Constructed wetland; Greenhouse gases; Mesocosm
   experiment; Peatland; Wetland management
AB Climate change is identified as a major threat to wetlands. Altered hydrology and rising temperature can change the biogeochemistry and function of a wetland to the degree that some important services might be turned into disservices. This means that they will, for example, no longer provide a water purification service and adversely they may start to decompose and release nutrients to the surface water. Moreover, a higher rate of decomposition than primary production (photosynthesis) may lead to a shift of their function from being a sink of carbon to a source. This review paper assesses the potential response of natural wetlands (peatlands) and constructed wetlands to climate change in terms of gas emission and nutrients release. In addition, the impact of key climatic factors such as temperature and water availability on wetlands has been reviewed. The authors identified the methodological gaps and weaknesses in the literature and then introduced a new framework for conducting a comprehensive mesocosm experiment to address the existing gaps in literature to support future climate change research on wetland ecosystems. In the future, higher temperatures resulting in drought might shift the role of both constructed wetland and peatland from a sink to a source of carbon. However, higher temperatures accompanied by more precipitation can promote photosynthesis to a degree that might exceed the respiration and maintain the carbon sink role of the wetland. There might be a critical water level at which the wetland can preserve most of its services. In order to find that level, a study of the key factors of climate change and their interactions using an appropriate experimental method is necessary. Some contradictory results of past experiments can be associated with different methodologies, designs, time periods, climates, and natural variability. Hence a long-term simulation of climate change for wetlands according to the proposed framework is recommended. This framework provides relatively more accurate and realistic simulations, valid comparative results, comprehensive understanding and supports coordination between researchers. This can help to find a sustainable management strategy for wetlands to be resilient to climate change.

AB Temporal trends in stream water total organic carbon (TOC) concentration and export were studied in 8 forested headwater catchments situated in eastern Finland. The Seasonal Kendall test was conducted to identify the trends and a mixed model regression analysis was used to describe how catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological variables (e.g. precipitation, air and stream water temperatures, and atmospheric deposition) related to the variation in the concentration and export of stream water TOC. The 8 catchments varied in size from 29 to 494 ha and in the proportion of peatland they contained, from 8 to 70%. Runoff and TOC concentration were monitored for 15-29 years (1979-2006). Trends and variation in TOC levels were analysed from annual and seasonal time series. Mean annual TOC concentration increased significantly in seven of the eight catchments. The trends were the strongest in spring and most apparent during the last decade of the study period. The slopes of the trends were generally smaller than the variation in TOC concentration between years and seasons and between catchments. The annual TOC export showed no clear trends and values were largely determined by the temporal variability in runoff. Annual runoff showed a decreasing trend in two of the eight catchments. Mean annual air and stream water temperatures showed increasing trends, most clearly seen in the summer and autumn series. According to our modeling results. stream water temperature, precipitation and peatland percentage were the most important variables explaining annual and most seasonal TOC concentrations. The atmospheric deposition of SO(4), NH(4), and NO(3) decreased significantly over the study period, but no significant link with TOC concentration was found. Precipitation was the main hydrometeorological driver of the TOC export. We concluded that stream water TOC concentrations and exports are mainly driven by catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological factors rather than trends in atmospheric acid deposition.

SO NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

ID PROJECTIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS; PREDICTIONS; BIOMOD; RISK
AB We present an analysis of different sources of impact model uncertainty and combine this with probabilistic projections of climate change. Climatic envelope models describing the spatial distribution of palsa mires (mire complexes with permafrost peat hummocks) in northern Fennoscandia were calibrated for three baseline periods, eight state-of-the-art modelling techniques and 25 versions sampling the parameter uncertainty of each technique - a total of 600 models. The sensitivity of these models to changes in temperature and precipitation was analysed to construct impact response surfaces. These were used to assess the behaviour of models when extrapolated into changed climate conditions, so that new criteria, in addition to conventional model evaluation statistics, could be defined for determining model reliability. Impact response surfaces were also combined with climate change projections to estimate the risk of areas suitable for palsas disappearing during the 21st century. Structural differences in impact models appeared to be a major source of uncertainty, with 69% of the models giving implausible projections. Generalized additive modelling (GAM) was judged to be the most reliable technique for model extrapolation. Using GAM, it was estimated as very likely (>90% probability) that the area suitable for palsas is reduced to less than half the baseline area by the period 2030-2049 and as likely (>66% probability) that the entire area becomes unsuitable by 2080-2099 (A1B emission scenario). The risk of total loss of palsa area was reduced for a mitigation scenario under which global warming was constrained to below 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial climate, although it too implied a considerable reduction in area suitable for palsas.

AB n-Alkanes from the Great Hinggan Mountain ombrotrophic peat bog in northeast China record changes in vegetation and climate of the East Asian monsoon marginal region over the past 800 yr. At the end of the Medieval Warm period, shrubs and/or sedges were the predominant plants, and the climate was warm and dry. The subsequent appearance of large amounts of Pinus and Sphagnum spp. indicate that climate entered a cold and wet period between 750 and 650 cal yr BP when the East Asian summer monsoon intensified. Microbial diagenesis increased and diminished n-alkane preservation after 650 cal yr BP, suggesting that the climate gradually varied from cold and wet to warm and dry conditions. During the period between 500 and 100 cal yr BP, the climate entered a long period of relatively cold and wet conditions, corresponding to the Little Ice Age. Together with other records, our n-alkane-inferred climate reconstruction in northeast China appears to follow the typical warm/dry and cold/wet changes in East Asia over the past 800 yr. Moreover, we propose that temperature-induced evaporation played a more important role than East Asian monsoon precipitation in northeast China over the past 800 yr. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study demonstrates linkages between the 1997/1998 El Nino/Southern Oscillation index and a threshold shift to increased permafrost loss within a southern Taiga Plains watershed, Northwest Territories, Canada. Three-dimensional contraction of permafrost plateaus and changes in vegetation structural characteristics are determined from multitemporal airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) surveys in 2008, 2011 and 2015. Morphological changes in permafrost cover are compared with optical image analogues from 1970, 1977, 2000 and 2008 and time-series hydro-climate data. Results demonstrate that significant changes in air temperature, precipitation, runoff and a shortening of the snow-covered season by 35 days (1998-2014) and 50 days (1998 only) occurred after 1997. The albedo reduction associated with 35 and 50 days less snow cover leads to increases in shortwave energy receipt during the active thaw period of similar to 12% (3% annually) and similar to 16% (5% annually), respectively. From 2000 to 2015, sporadic permafrost loss accelerated from 0.19% (of total basin area) per year between 1970 and 2000 to 0.58% per year from 2000 to 2015, with a projected total loss of permafrost by similar to 2044. From similar to 1997 to 2011, we observe a corresponding shift to increased runoff ratio. However, observed increases in the proportion of snow precipitation and the volumetric contribution of permafrost loss to runoff post-1997 (0.6-6.4% per year) cannot fully explain this shift. This suggests increases in drainage efficiency and possible losses from long-term groundwater storage as a result of subtle terrain morphological and soil zone hydraulic conductivity changes. These hydrological changes appear coincident with high vegetation mortality at plateau margins combined with succession-related canopy growth in some bog and fen areas, which are presumed to be drying. Similar changes in runoff response were observed at adjacent Birch, Trout and Jean Marie River watersheds indicating that observations are representative of northern Boreal sporadic permafrost/wetland watersheds in the Taiga Plains.

AB Accurate projections of climate change impacts on the vast carbon stores of northern peatlands require detailed knowledge of ecosystem respiration (ER) and its heterotrophic (Rh) and autotrophic (Ra) components. Currently, however, standard flux measurement techniques, i.e. eddy covariance and manual chambers, generate empirical ER data during only night- or daytime, respectively, which are extrapolated to the daily scale based on the paradigm that assumes a uniform diel temperature response. Here, using continuous autochamber measurements, we demonstrate a distinct bimodal pattern in diel peatland ER which contrasts the unimodal pattern inherent to the classical assumption. This feature results from divergent temperature dependencies of day- and nighttime ER due to varying contributions from Rh and Ra. We further find that disregarding these bimodal dynamics causes significant bias in ER estimates across multiple temporal scales.

AB Precipitation patterns are becoming increasingly extreme, particularly at northern latitudes. Current climate models predict that this trend will continue in the future. While droughts have been repeatedly studied in many ecosystems over the last decades, the consequences of increasingly intense, but less frequent rainfall events, on carbon (C) cycling are not well understood. At northern latitudes, peatlands store one third of the terrestrial carbon and their functioning is highly dependent on water. Shifts in rainfall regimes could disrupt peatland C dynamics and speed-up the rates of C loss. How will these immense stocks of C be able to withstand and recover from extreme rainfall? We tested the resistance and resilience effects of extreme precipitation regimes on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes, pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and litter decomposition rates by exposing intact peat cores to extreme, spring-time rainfall patterns in a controlled mesocosm experiment. We find that more intense but less frequent rainfall destabilized water table dynamics, with cascading effects on peatland C fluxes. Decomposition and respiration rates increased with a deeper mean water table depth (WTD) and larger WTD fluctuations. We observed similar patterns for CO2 uptake, which were likely mediated by improved vascular plant performance. After a three-week recovery period, CO2 fluxes still displayed responses to the earlier WTD dynamics, suggesting lagged effects of precipitation regime shifts. Furthermore, we found that CH4 emissions decreased with deeper mean WTD, but this showed a high resilience once WTD dynamics stabilised. Not only do our results illustrate that shifting rainfall patterns translate in altered WTD dynamics and, consequentially, influence C fluxes, they also demonstrate that exposure to altered rainfall early in the growing season can have lasting effects on CO2 exchange. Even though the increased CO2 assimilation under extreme precipitation patterns signals peatland resistance under changing climatic conditions, it may instead mark the onset of vascular plant encroachment and the associated C loss.

AB Sphagnum mosses form a major component of northern peatlands, which are expected to experience substantially higher increases in temperature and winter precipitation than the global average. Sphagnum may play an important role in the responses of the global carbon cycle to climate change. We investigated the responses of summer length growth, carpet structure and production in Sphagnum fuscum to experimentally induced changes in climate in a sub-arctic bog. Thereto, we used open-top chambers (OTCs) to create six climate scenarios including changes in summer temperatures, and changes in winter snow cover and spring temperatures. In winter, the OTCs doubled the snow thickness, resulting in 0.5-2.8degreesC higher average air temperatures. Spring air temperatures in OTCs increased by 1.0degreesC. Summer warming had a maximum effect of 0.9degreesC, while vapor pressure deficit was not affected. The climate manipulations had strong effects on S. fuscum. Summer warming enhanced the length increment by 42-62%, whereas bulk density decreased. This resulted in a trend (P<0.10) of enhanced biomass production. Winter snow addition enhanced dry matter production by 33%, despite the fact that the length growth and bulk density did not change significantly. The addition of spring warming to snow addition alone did not significantly enhance this effect, but we may have missed part of the early spring growth. There were no interactions between the manipulations in summer and those in winter/spring, indicating that the effects were additive. Summer warming may in the long term negatively affect productivity through the adverse effects of changes in Sphagnum structure on moisture holding and transporting capacity. Moreover, the strong length growth enhancement may affect interactions with other mosses and vascular plants. Because winter snow addition enhanced the production of S. fuscum without affecting its structure, it may increase the carbon balance of northern peatlands.

AB Light attenuation associated with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter (i.e. browning) is likely to affect the response of benthic biofilms to nutrient enrichment and warmer temperatures expected for northern aquatic ecosystems with climate change. To examine how these factors will interact to regulate the association between algae and heterotrophic bacteria in northern peatlands, we manipulated light (100%, 60%, 30%, 20% and 5% of ambient), nutrients (unenriched, enriched) and temperature (ambient, warming), in a full factorial design by shading nutrient diffusing substrates inside mesocosms with or without warming (3 degrees C) in an Alaskan fen. After 12days of experimental conditions, there was no effect of light or temperature on the abundance of algae or bacteria in the absence of nutrient enrichment. Enrichment with a combination of nitrogen and phosphorus significantly increased the abundance of algae and heterotrophic bacteria at ambient light levels (418molm(-2)s(-1)), and warming significantly enhanced the positive effects of nutrients on algal accrual. Although warming enhanced the effects of nutrient enrichment on bacterial growth, the magnitude of the effect was not statistically significant compared to nutrient enrichment alone. The positive influence of nutrient enrichment and the synergistic effects of nutrients and warming on algae and bacteria were lost at 30% ambient light (below 125molm(-2)s(-1)). We conducted a separate laboratory incubation using recirculating water baths maintained at either ambient or elevated water temperature (warming of 5 degrees C) to evaluate the effects of warming on the use of algal exudates by heterotrophic bacteria. During the 16-day assay, the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria increased rapidly in the presence of a common solution of algal exudates and the rate of exudate assimilation by bacteria was significantly enhanced by warming compared with ambient temperature. The positive association between light availability and heterotrophic bacteria, coupled with accelerated bacterial growth in the presence of algal exudates, support bacterial dependence on algal subsidies in the presence of recalcitrant organic substrates in this northern peatland. Within a predictive context, our results demonstrate that greater light attenuation associated with browning of surface water may reduce the positive influence of warmer temperatures and elevated nutrient levels on the microbial loop by reducing algal production on submerged surfaces in northern peatlands.

AB Calcareous fens are azonal habitats permanently saturated by groundwater. This is expected to have a buffer effect on soil temperature, alleviating climate changes and allowing plant communities to occupy diverse climatic regions. We analysed the extent of such buffering and its relation with a relevant plant trait, the seed germination niche breadth, along altitudinal gradients in fens of the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain) and the Western Carpathians (Slovakia). In each fen we recorded soil temperature for several years and compared it with WorldClim predictions for air temperature. We also collected seeds from five Cyperaceae fen specialists to evaluate the influence of soil temperature on germination. Although the soil temperatures and WorldClim predictions were strongly correlated, their absolute values differed substantially, showing a narrower thermal amplitude and warmer minimum winter temperature in the soil. The greatest differences in soil temperature and germination niche breadth were those between mountain regions. Narrower germination niches correlated with the colder Slovak winter. Our results suggest that the soil thermal buffer allows species to escape frost temperatures in winter, but also high summer temperatures in warm regions, explaining their wide distribution ranges. The warm regeneration niche does not match the cooler soils, but shows variability and potential for adaptation. While these findings support resilience to climate warming, changes in precipitation rather than temperature seem to be the main threat for fen persistence.

AB Headwater stream ecosystems draining blanket peat-dominated catchments occur in many high-latitude river systems. These systems are thought to be very sensitive to threats from climate change, and land-use modification including artificial drainage, overgrazing, afforestation and vegetation burning. This study examined ten peatland streams in the headwaters of the River Tees to examine spatial and seasonal patterns of instream physicochemical variables and benthic macroinvertebrate communities across the stream network. Principle component analysis revealed significant positive relationships between catchment size and electrical conductivity, sulfate concentration, pH and median bed sediment size, and negative relationships with suspended sediment and aluminium concentrations. Seasonal variability was particularly evident in stream water temperature, benthic particulate organic matter and nitrate and chloride concentrations. Macroinvertebrate community abundance and diversity were typically similar across streams, but redundancy analysis demonstrated turnover of macroinvertebrate assemblages with increases in stream size. In particular, first-and second-order streams hosted small-sized stoneflies such as Amphinemura standfussi and Nemoura cambrica, while larger streams (third-and fourth-order) supported more mayflies and larger predatory stoneflies (e. g. Dinocras cephalotes and Perla bipunctata). Many environmental drivers of ecological patterns appear to work in synergy in peatland headwater streams, and controlled experiments may be necessary to disentangle some of the variables to guide effective conservation and management strategies in impacted peatland river systems.

AB The peat sequence at Hani in northeastern China accumulated over the past 16 cal kyr in a percolation mire in which rain water and ground water seeped through the peat system. The molecular compositions of n-alkanes, n-alkanols, and n-alkanoic acids extracted from the Hani peat sequence reveal different responses to the progressive evolution of climate and changes in the nature of the peat-forming vegetation. Long chain length components that originate from the waxy coatings of subaerial vascular plants dominate the n-alkane distributions throughout the Hani peat sequence. The paleoclimate integrity of these biomarker molecules appears to be well preserved. Most of the n-alkanol distributions are similarly dominated by long chain components that indicate their origins from subaerial plants. In contrast, n-alkanoic acid distributions are dominated by secondary components that record the importance of post-depositional microbial activity in this peat sequence, which evidently can be extensive in a percolation mire.
   Elevated n-alkane P(aq) values and C(23)/C(29) ratios, which are both molecular proxies for water-loving plants, record an especially moist local climate in the Bolling-Allerod (14.5 to 12.9 ka), Younger Dryas (12.9 to 11.5 ka), and Pre-Boreal (11.5 to 10.5 ka) portions of the Hard peat sequence. Depressed P(aq) values and C(23)/C(29) ratios and larger n-alkane average chain length values indicate that the Holocene Climatic Optimum (10.5 to 6 ka) was a period of warmer climate with lower effective precipitation, which contrasts with evidence of wetter climates in most of East Asia.

AB The natural environment of Estonia is sensitive to climate change due to its location in a transitional zone between areas with different bioclimatic conditions. We studied the NAO index and data on temperature, moisture, wind, and sea level regimes in Estonia and the Baltic Sea region. We also looked at the relationships between meteorological forcing time series and changes in wetlands. The effects of changing climatic conditions are clearly reflected in the data from the station at Tooma mire, where we identified shorter snow-cover duration, decreased soil-frost depth and changed groundwater levels in the bog. In comparing various types of Estonian wetlands under such changing climatic conditions, we also identified greater instability in the character of coastal wetlands compared to that of the inland bogs. We found that the most marked coastal changes in Estonia result from a combination of strong storms, high sea levels induced by storm surge, ice free seas and unfrozen sediments. Finally, we also found that a significant trend in the development of seashore grasslands is the replacement of former meadows by reed beds, shrubberies or woodland.

AB The persistence of species under changed climatic conditions depends on adaptations and plastic responses to these conditions and on interactions with their local plant community resulting in direct and indirect effects of changed climatic conditions. Populations at species' range margins may be especially crucial in containing a gene pool comprising adaptations to extreme climatic conditions. Many species of northern European bog ecosystems reach their southern lowland range limit in central Europe. In a common-garden experiment, we experimentally assessed the impact of projected climatic changes on five bog-plant species (including peat moss Sphagnum magellanicum) sampled along a latitudinal gradient of 1400km from Scandinavia to the marginal lowland populations in Germany. Populations were cultivated in monocultures and in experimental communities composed of all five species from their local community, and exposed to five combinations of three climate treatments (warming, fluctuating water-tables, fertilization) in a southern common garden. Whereas most monocultures showed a decreasing biomass production from southern to northern origins under southern environmental conditions, in the experimental mixed-species communities, an increasing biomass production towards northern communities was observed together with a shift in interspecific interactions along the latitudinal gradient. While negative dominance effects prevailed in southern communities, higher net biodiversity effects were observed in northern subarctic communities. The combined effects of climate treatments increased biomass production in monocultures of most origins. In communities, however, overall the treatments did not result in significantly changed biomass production. Among individual treatments, water-table fluctuations caused a significant decrease in biomass production, but only in southern communities, indicating higher vulnerability to changed climatic conditions. Here, negative effects of climate treatments on graminoids were not compensated by the slightly increased growth of peat moss that benefited from interspecific interactions only in northern communities.Synthesis. We conclude that shifting interactions within multispecies communities caused pronounced responses to changed climatic conditions in wetland communities of temperate southern marginal, but not of northern subarctic origin. Therefore, future models investigating the impacts of climate change on plant communities should consider geographical variation in species interactions an important factor influencing community responses to changed climatic conditions.

AB Extreme climate events are observed and predicted to increase in frequency and duration in high-latitudeecosystems as a result of global climate change. This includes extreme precipitation events, which maydirectly impact on belowground food webs and ecosystem functioning by their physical impacts and byaltering local soil moisture conditions.
   We assessed responses of the Collembola community in a northern Sphagnum fuscum-dominatedombrotrophic peatland to three years of experimentally increased occurrence of extreme precipitationevents. Annual summer precipitation was doubled (an increase of 200 mm) by 16 simulated extremerain events within the three months growing season, where on each occasion 12.5 mm of rain was addedwithin a few minutes. Despite this high frequency and intensity of the rain events, no shifts in Collemboladensity, relative species abundances and community weighted means of three relevant traits (moisturepreference, vertical distribution and body size) were observed. This strongly suggests that the peatlandCollembola community is unaffected by the physical impacts of extreme precipitation and the short-termvariability in moisture conditions. The lack of response is most likely reinforced by the fact that extremeprecipitation events do not seem to alter longer-term soil moisture conditions in the peat layers inhabitedby soil fauna.
   This study adds evidence to the observation that the biotic components of northern ombrotrophicpeatlands are hardly responsive to an increase in extreme summer precipitation events. Given the importance of these ecosystems for the global C balance, these findings significantly contribute to the currentknowledge of the ecological impact of future climate scenarios.

DE Marion Island; climate change; synoptic weather; mire temperatures
AB This paper presents the first high resolution temperature data from a small Agrostis magellanica mire on subantarctic Marion Island as part of an ongoing island-wide monitoring project on subsurface ground temperature variability. Variations in ground temperatures were found to be directly linked to the passage of synoptic scale weather systems that influence thermal characteristics and heat fluxes especially in the upper 30 cm of the mire. Preliminary data published here suggest that shallow temperatures will be most affected by changes in synoptic climate that Marion Island is currently experiencing with an increase in average temperatures and a reduction in temperature variability with depth. This study proposes that to effectively detect the ecosystem responses to climate change in a maritime sub-Antarctic environment the temporal scale of measurement needs to be at least on a diurnal scale to be effective.

AB Climate change projections indicate increases in CO2 emissions and DOC release from peatlands, thereby potentially transforming them from sinks to carbon sources. The individual effects of abiotic and biotic factors on peatland carbon exports and the interactions among all these factors are still poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a field study over two years in a peatland complex by selecting four habitats differing in their dominant vegetation (shrub, grass, sedge and moss) in order to assess the links between abiotic and biotic factors and carbon release at each habitat. Accounting for the wide variability across habitats allowed us to examine the direct and indirect effects of abiotic and biotic factors on carbon cycling at the ecosystem level (i.e. the whole peatland complex). Results showed that the habitats dominated by vascular plants had the highest microbial and above-ground plant biomass, as well as the highest values of Acari and Collembola biomass, whereas Enchytraeidae biomass was dominant in the moss habitat. Furthermore, at ecosystem level, the SEM explained 75% of the total soil respiration variation and 33% of the DOC variation. Accordingly, soil respiration was directly linked to enchytraeid biomass, with these invertebrates being positively related to soil moisture. In contrast, both soil temperature and soil moisture had direct effects on microbial and Acari biomass, and the interaction between Acari biomass and below-ground plant biomass was responsible for DOC release. These findings provide new insights into the role of soil biota in carbon dynamics in peatlands, by showing that the direct effects of abiotic factors on biotic communities (both plants and soil organisms) determine how much carbon is lost from these systems (either as CO2 e or DOC).

AB As potential outcomes of climate change, we examined the effects of environmental warming and drying on instantaneous CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes in three sedge fens situated in the northern and middle boreal zones. Warming was induced by means of open top chambers (OTCs) and drying through drainage via ditching. OTCs raised the air temperature by 0.2-2 degrees C, whereas short-term drainage dropped the water-table level (WTL) by 5-10 cm and long-term drainage by 10-30 cm. The impact of simulated warming was rather negligible as warmer and drier conditions caused net ecosystem exchange (NEE) to decrease only at one of the two mid-boreal sites. Otherwise, the temperature rise alone or paired with WTL drawdown did not alter gas fluxes at any of the sites. Instead, the drainage effect overrode that of warming. Primarily WTL drawdown accounted for the differences in fluxes detected, but this was more apparent at the mid-boreal sites than our northern-boreal one. Notably, the northernmost Lompolojankka sedge fen, which was both the coolest and wettest of the three sites, was least sensitive to temperature rise and drainage; there, only CH4 emissions were affected by WTL drawdown.

AB Both bog surface wetness and atmospheric dust deposition are intricately linked to changes in the hydrological cycle and pairing these types of records at the same site provides complementary information. Here a peat core from Store Mosse in southern Sweden covering the last 8500 years was used to make a high-resolution paleoclimate reconstruction based on a combination of bog development, colourimetric humification and inorganic geochemistry data. The coupling of Principal Component Analysis with changepoint modelling allowed for precise linking of changes in bog surface wetness and dust deposition records.
   A long-term trend towards warm (and possibly wet) conditions starts ca 8150 cal yr BP and culminates with the most pronounced conditions from 6900 to 6600 cal yr BP. The most significant arid period at Store Mosse occurred between 6500 and 5600 cal yr BP during which dust deposition was significantly higher. Wetter conditions dominate from 5500 to 4980 cal yr BP as the transition from the Hypsithermal and into the Neoglacial is made. After a shift to drier conditions, humification enters a more stable period that lasts from 4525 until 3200 cal yr BP. It is during this time that the first possible anthropogenic dust signals occur at ca 4200 cal yr BP. From 3200 cal yr BP to present humification generally shows a long-term decline moving towards wetter conditions. The main exceptions are during the transition from the Neoglacial to Roman Warm Period which is registered as a significantly wetter period and two dry periods recorded 2365 to 2155 cal yr BP and 1275-1105 cal yr BP. In general, the observed changes agree well with regional records of effective humidity and temperature. The high temporal resolution of the Store Mosse record reveals that palaeoclimatic change over the last 8500 years in southern Sweden has had a complex and variable structure. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The notion that plants are tightly coupled to their belowground environment so that decomposition occurs faster in their place of origin is now a widely tested hypothesis known as the home-field advantage (HFA). Microbial adaptation to the most prevalent plant litter is the hypothesis proposed to explain decomposition results in a number of HFA studies but fails to corroborate results of many others, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of decomposition dynamics at local scales. Boreal peatlands are important ecosystems for carbon storage that are expected to be significantly affected by climate change, thus understanding decomposition dynamics in Boreal peatland systems is of global relevance. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment using pure and mixed litters of two dominant peatland plant types (Sphagnum moss and Carex sedge) present in differing densities at two sites differing in nutrient status in a Boreal peatland complex. Aboveground (temperature, relative humidity) and belowground (pH, moisture, available nitrogen) environmental characteristics were measured, and initial litter quality (C, N, S) was assessed with decomposition (mass loss) quantified after one year. We use linked HFA equations that help account for differences in litter quality and site conditions. While Carex lost greater overall mass than Sphagnum, both Carex and Sphagnum demonstrate a HFA, but only where they were the dominant plant of each site. This result held for both pure and mixed litters, suggesting microbial specificity to the most prevalent plant type, yet mixed litters moderated the strength of the HFA. While our results provide novel insights to plant-soil linkages and mixed litter interactions in Boreal peatlands, mechanisms underpinning microbial specificity to plant litter in these ecosystems requires further investigation.

AB Peatland catchments store vast amounts of carbon. Humic lakes and pools are the primary receptacles for terrigenous carbon in these meta-ecosystems, representing sequestration hotspots; boreal lakes alone store ca. 120 similar to Pg C. But little is known about the mechanisms that preserve aquatic carbon stocks. Here, we determined the regulatory pathway of decomposition in relation to traditional limitations, namely anoxia, decay inhibiting compounds, low nutrients and acidity, using in vitro manipulation, mesocosms and natural gradients. We show that anoxia represents a powerful hierarchical preservation mechanism affecting all major limitations on decomposition and recapturing carbon that would otherwise escape from peatlands. Oxygen constraints on microbial synthesis of oxidases and nutrient-cycling enzymes, prevents the decay of organic matter to CO2, CH4 and N2O by allowing inhibitor accumulation and lowering nutrients. However, this pathway is sensitive to direct nutrient inputs and therefore eutrophication could initiate catastrophic feedback to global warming via dramatically increased greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying these process-specific limitations should inform better management and conservation of these vital systems.

   isotopomers; NMR; photorespiration; sphagnum
AB Sphagnum mosses account for most accumulated dead organic matter in peatlands. Therefore, understanding their responses to increasing atmospheric CO2 is needed for estimating peatland C balances under climate change. A key process is photorespiration: a major determinant of net photosynthetic C assimilation that depends on the CO2 to O-2 ratio. We used climate chambers to investigate photorespiratory responses of Sphagnum fuscum hummocks to recent increases in atmospheric CO2 (from 280 to 400 ppm) under different water table, temperature, and light intensity levels. We tested the photorespiratory variability using a novel method based on deuterium isotopomers (D6(S)/D6(R) ratio) of photosynthetic glucose. The effect of elevated CO2 on photorespiration was highly dependent on water table. At low water table (-20 cm), elevated CO2 suppressed photorespiration relative to C assimilation, thus substantially increasing the net primary production potential. In contrast, a high water table (similar to 0 cm) favored photorespiration and abolished this CO2 effect. The response was further tested for Sphagnum majus lawns at typical water table levels (similar to 0 and -7 cm), revealing no effect of CO2 under those conditions. Our results indicate that hummocks, which typically experience low water table levels, benefit from the 20th century's increase in atmospheric CO2.

AB Measurements of landscape-scale methane emission were made over an aapa mire near Kaamanen in Finnish Lapland (69 degrees 8' N, 27 degrees 16' E, 155 m ASL. Emissions were measured during the spring thaw, in summer and in autumn. No effect of water table position on CH4 emission was found as the water table remained at or above the surface of the peat. Methane emission fluxes increased with surface temperature from which an activation energy of -99 kJ mol(-1) was obtained. Annual emission from the site, modelled from temperature regression and short-term flux measurements made in three separate years, was calculated to be 5.5 +/- 0.4 g CH4 m(-2) y(-1) of which 0.6 +/-0.1 g CH4 m(-2) y(-1) (11%) was released during the spring thaw which lasted 20 to 30 days.
   The effect of global warming on the CH4 budget of the site was estimated using the central scenario of the SILMU (Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change) model which predicts annual mean temperature increases of 1.2, 2.4 and 4.4 degreesC in 2020, 2050 and 2100, respectively. Maximum enhancements in CH4 emission due to warming were calculated to be 18, 40 and 84% for 2020, 2050 and 2100, respectively. Actual increases may be smaller because prediction of changes in water table are highly uncertain.

AB Lipid biomarkers extracted from a peat core obtained from the northeast edge of the Tibetan Plateau have provided a 13 kyr record of regional climate change. A period of warmer climate corresponding to the Holocene Optimum between 9 ka and 5 ka is evident in greater alteration of n-alkanoic acids and n-alkanols and in the appearance of biomarkers indicative of greater microbial activity. Concomitant increases in local precipitation that raised the water level of the peat bog are recorded by increases in the proportions of C-23 and C-25 n-alkanes that are mainly derived from submerged/floating plants. Alternations in submergent and emergent plant n-alkane proxies reveal multi-decimeter scale rises and falls in the bog water level that relate to variation in precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene. Major low water level events occurred around 12.6, 11.3, 10.7, 9.4, 8.3, 6.0, 4.5, 3.1, 2.1 and 1.0 ka. These events correlate well with cold dry events recorded in same region from other climatic proxies that reflect millennial-scale Holocene instability in the Asian monsoon system. Our biomarker results also indicate that peat accumulation and preservation on the Tibetan Plateau are more sensitive to variability in monsoonal precipitation than in annual temperature.

AB We use the stratigraphy of floodplains on Alaska's North Slope to describe how tundra watersheds responded to climate changes over the last 15,000 calibrated years BP (15 cal ka BP). Two episodes of extremely rapid floodplain alluviation occurred during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, one between 14 and 12.8 cal ka BP and the other between 11.5 and 9.5 cal ka BP. These aggradation episodes coincided with periods of warming in summer when cottonwood (Populus balsamifera L) expanded its range, peatlands became established, and widespread thermokarst occurred. The two aggradation episodes were separated by a period of floodplain incision during the Younger Dryas under cooler and possibly drier conditions. At times of increasing summer warmth, melting permafrost and enhanced precipitation probably triggered widespread mass wasting on hillslopes that overwhelmed the capacity of streams to transport sediment downstream, and rapid floodplain aggradation resulted. After peatlands became widespread in the early Holocene, rivers slowly incised their valley fills. Because major pulses of sediment input were limited to times of rapid thaw and increasing moisture, many floodplains on the North Slope have been effectively decoupled from upstream hillslopes for much of the past 15,000 years. Our findings: (a) confirm the sensitivity of arctic watersheds to rapid warming in summer, (b) emphasize the importance of hillslope mass wasting in landscape-scale responses to climate change, and (c) suggest that the presence of peatland on this arctic landscape today has raised its geomorphic response threshold to climate warming compared to what it was 14,000 years ago.

AB Sphagnum bogs possess irreplaceable ecological and economic value, and they are scarce in China, with a fragmented distribution. Based on 19 high-resolution bioclimatic environmental datasets and 71 bog center point locations, we employed a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to reconstruct and predict the spatial-temporal geographical distribution patterns of Sphagnum bogs from the last interglacial (LIG) period to two typical CO2 representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP8.5) in the future. We further computed the migratory paths of the distribution center points. Finally, a jackknife test was used to uncover the crucial environmental factors restricting the geographical distribution of the bogs. Our data indicated that the MaxEnt niche model had a high simulation precision with an area under the ROC curve value of 0.957. Spatially, the suitable bog habitats are currently centralized in northeastern China, including the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the Changbai Mountains, as well as peripheral areas of the Sichuan Basin. Temporally, the contours of Sphagnum bogs were similar to the present and rendered from the last glacial maximum (LMG) period, and had much more total area than the current. The total area in LIG was nearly the same as the current because of the similar climate. It was worth noting that there would be a reduction of the total area in the future. Loss of area occurred at the edges of bogs, especially under RCP8.5. The distribution center of bogs will shift to the northwest in the immediate future. The precipitation of driest month, the mean temperature of warmest quarter and the precipitation of warmest quarter were identified as crucial climatic factors affecting the distribution of Sphagnum bogs. Overall, our research provides scientific evidence for the long-term protection and effective management of these rare, precious natural resources and suggestions for in situ conservation.

However, both types of methods have drawbacks either on their mechanistic interpretation or ecological relevance. We propose an experimental set-up that combines the best of both methods and can be easily obtained by modifying widely available Tullgren soil fauna extractors. This set-up creates or alters temperature and moisture gradients within intact field soil cores, after which soil biota, their activity and vertical movements can be studied. We assessed the performance and demonstrated the applicability of this set-up through a case study on Collembola response to changes in microclimatic gradients in peat bogs. Warming created a vertical temperature gradient of 14 degrees C in peat cores without varying soil moisture conditions, while at a given temperature regime, precipitation and drought treatments shifted natural soil moisture gradients to wetter' and drier', respectively. This allowed for disentangling interacting warming and moisture effects on soil fauna. In our case study, Collembola communities showed peat layer-specific responses to these climate treatments. Warming decreased Collembola density and altered community composition in the shallowest layer, whereas precipitation increase affected Collembola community composition in the deepest layer. We showed that climate change can have layer-specific effects on soil organisms that are hidden' by not taking microclimatic vertical gradients into account. This experimental set-up facilitates studying (multitrophic) organism responses to climate changes, with only a small adjustment of equipment that is often already present in soil ecology laboratories. Moreover, this set-up can be easily customized to study many more other research questions related to wide-ranging organisms and ecosystems.

AB High-latitude region is sensitive to global climate change, and pollen record in sediments could reflect vegetation variation which responded to climate change. The Great Hinggan Mountains are main distribution areas of peatlands in high-latitude region in China and located at East Asian summer monsoonal margin, however, the variation of vegetation and climate in this region is still unclear. Based on the AMS C-14 dating, we analyzed the pollen assemblages to reconstruct vegetation history in Tuqiang (TQ) peatland, and we also used the principal component analysis to reconstruct the temperature and effective moisture and compared with other palaeoclimate records. Pollen assemblage denoted a coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest on the surrounding mountains, and peatland vegetation gradually evolved from herb community (Cyperaceae) to bush community (Ericaceae). The climate of north part in the Great Hinggan Mountains was mainly controlled by the East Asian Summer Monsoon which related to ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific. During the period from 3300 to 1150 cal yr BP, the dominant plant was Cyperaceae, with coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests bordered the peatland, which pointed to a relatively warm and wet climate. Between 1150 and 600 cal yr BP, the expansion of pine forests indicated a cool climate. The interval of 600-300 cal yr BP, the climate became cold and dry which related to the Little Ice Age. Since the 300 cal yr BP, Betula and Ericaceae dominated, the climate became warmer and drier. The obvious increase of secondary birch forests at the expense of pine forests may be the results of human disturbance, anthropogenic activities strengthened gradually and the variation of peatland vegetation was influenced mainly by anthropogenic activities rather than by climate since approximately 600 cal yr BP.

AB Prediction of the effect of harvests and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of forests is necessary both for CC mitigation and adaptation purposes.
   We assessed the impact of roundwood and fuelwood removals and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of Finnish forests during 2007-2042. We considered three harvest scenarios: two based on the recent projections of roundwood and fuelwood demand, and the third reflecting the maximum sustainable cutting level. We applied two climate scenarios: the climate was in the state that prevailed around year 2006, or it changed according to the IPCC SRES A1B scenario.
   We combined the large-scale forestry model MELA with the soil carbon model Yasso07 for mineral soils. For soils of drained, forested peatlands, we used a method based on emission factors.
   The stock change of trees accounted for approximately 80 % of the total stock change. Trees and mineral soils acted as carbon sinks and the drained peatland soils as a carbon source. The forest carbon sink increased clearly in both of the demand-based scenarios, reaching the level of 13-20 Tg C/year (without CC). The planned increase in the use of bioenergy reduced the forest sink by 2.6 Tg C/year. CC increased the forest carbon sink in 2042 by 38 %-58 % depending on the scenario. CC decreased the sink of mineral soils in the initial years of the simulations; after 2030, the effect was slightly positive. CC increased the emissions from the drained peatland soils.
   It is likely that forest land in Finland acts as a carbon sink in the future. The changes in carbon stocks of trees, mineral soils, and peatland soils respond differently to CC and fuelwood and roundwood harvests.

AB In this study, we compare annual fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and soil respiratory carbon dioxide (CO2) measured at nine European peatlands (n = 4) and shrublands (n = 5). The sites range from northern Sweden to Spain, covering a span in mean annual air temperature from 0 to 16 degrees C, and in annual precipitation from 300 to 1300 mm yr(-1). The effects of climate change, including temperature increase and prolonged drought, were tested at five shrubland sites. At one peatland site, the long-term (> 30 yr) effect of drainage was assessed, while increased nitrogen deposition was investigated at three peatland sites.
   The shrublands were generally sinks for atmospheric CH4, whereas the peatlands were CH4 sources, with fluxes ranging from -519 to + 6890 mg CH4-Cm-2 yr(-1) across the studied ecosystems. At the peatland sites, annual CH4 emission increased with mean annual air temperature, while a negative relationship was found between net CH4 uptake and the soil carbon stock at the shrubland sites. Annual N2O fluxes were generally small ranging from -14 to 42 mg N2O-Nm(-2) yr(-1). Highest N2O emission occurred at the sites that had highest nitrate (NO3-) concentration in the soil water. Furthermore, experimentally increased NO3- deposition led to increased N2O efflux, whereas prolonged drought and long-term drainage reduced the N2O efflux. Soil CO2 emissions in control plots ranged from 310 to 732 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1). Drought and long-term drainage from -519 to + 6890 mg CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) across the studied ecosystems. At the peatland sites, annual CH4 emission increased with mean annual air temperature, while a negative relationship was found between net CH4 uptake and the soil carbon stock at the shrubland sites. Annual N2O fluxes were generally small ranging from -14 to 42 mg N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1). Highest N2O emission occurred at the sites that had highest nitrate (NO3-) concentration in the soil water. Furthermore, experimentally increased NO3- deposition led to increased N2O efflux, whereas prolonged drought and long-term drainage reduced the N2O efflux. Soil CO2 emissions in control plots ranged from 310 to 732 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1). Drought and long-term drainage generally reduced the soil CO2 efflux, except at a hydric shrubland where drought tended to increase soil respiration.
   In terms of fractional importance of each greenhouse gas to the total numerical global warming response, the change in CO2 efflux dominated the response in all treatments (ranging 71-96%), except for NO3- addition where 89% was due to change in CH4 emissions. Thus, in European peatlands and shrublands the effect on global warming induced by the investigated anthropogenic disturbances will be dominated by variations in soil CO2 fluxes.

AB Ecologically extreme habitats at a species' distribution edges bear significance for biota under adverse climatic conditions and climate change. Range-edge populations adjust their functional traits to the special local ecological conditions, leading to increased intraspecific variability in their morpho-anatomical structure and, consequently, favor population survival in the absence of competitors. On the basis of wood anatomical traits, such as tracheid lumen area (CA), cell wall thickness (CWTrad), cell diameter-to-radial cell wall thickness ratio (CD/CWT), and the number of tracheids in the radial tracheid files (TNo), we investigated the xylem adjustment of Pinus sylvestris L. populations from six ecologically extreme habitats from the Eastern Carpathians and the Pannonian Basin. Results indicated significant differences among all studied sites in case of all wood anatomical traits as signs of the local adaptation of trees. Peat bog populations adapted their wood anatomical traits to the generally hydric, cool and anaerobic conditions of the peat bogs, exhibiting smaller CA and proportionally thick CWTrad to ensure the hydraulic safety of the stem, whereas, on the lowland site, trees were characterized by a more effective water-conducting system, developing larger CA with relatively thin CWTrad with lower carbon-per-conduit-costs at the expense of higher vulnerability to cavitation. Radial tree ring growth and TNo also differed markedly among sites, following the temperature and groundwater constraints of the habitats. Wood anatomical variability among tree rings and the corresponding short-term climate response of populations differed from the adaptive responses of the trees to the ecological characteristics of the habitat. In addition to the different phylogeographic origin evidenced in former studies, phenotypic differentiation by the habitat type of the studied populations linked to the variance in morpho-anatomical traits have contributed to the survival of the peripheral Scots pine populations at the species' range margins.

A detailed chronology of accumulation, based an C-14, an occurrence of the Askja AD 1875 tephra and Am-241 measurements has been derived for the last 700 years. This shows significant changes in the mass balance of the peat profile, with minimum rates of net carbon sequestration overlapping with the period of minimum spring and summer temperature documented by published tree-ring evidence. The paper presents a methodology for calculating empirically past changes in the rate of net carbon sequestration in boreal peatlands and for exploring the effects of climatic variations (and possible future global warming) on these rates.

AB The evolution of delta plains and coastal floodplains is commonly believed to be influenced by sea-level and climate changes. However, regional climate change influences on the evolution of delta plains and floodplains are poorly understood compared with responses to rapid sea-level rise since the last deglaciation. This study investigated the Kimotsuki lowland delta plain evolution (Kyusyu, southern Japan), including allogenic controls, based on 28 auger cores and 28 radiocarbon ages. Large-scale crevasse splay deposition occurred at 7000-6000 cal yr BP in response to sea-level rise or increased sediment supply following a volcanic eruption. Afterwards, widespread peat was formed in the absence of substantial fluvial sedimentation. Decreased precipitation from a weakened East Asian summer monsoon may have dried the peatlands around 4000 cal yr BP. With increasing precipitation and storminess around 2000 cal yr BP, peat formation resumed at areas further from the Kimotsuki River, while increased overbank flows deposited organic-rich mud near the river. These changes may reflect an increased frequency of La Nina events and higher ocean surface temperatures of the Kuroshio extension. The increased storminess around 2000 cal yr BP may have produced similar influences on delta plain and coastal floodplain evolution across the East Asia region. The results of this study suggest that regional climate change in the late Holocene has a potential to control the evolution of coastal floodplains and delta plains.

AB Upper North Grain (UNG) is a heavily eroding blanket peat catchment in the Peak District, southern Pennines, UK. Concentrations of lead in the near-surface peat layer at UNG are in excess of 1000 mg kg(-1). For peatland environments, these lead concentrations are some of the highest globally. High concentrations of industrially derived, atmospherically transported magnetic spherules are also stored in the near-surface peat layer. Samples of suspended sediment taken during a storm event that occurred on 1 November 2002 at UNG, and of the potential catchment sources for suspended sediments, were analysed for lead content and the environmental magnetic properties of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM). At the beginning of the storm event, there is a peak in both suspended sediment and associated lead concentration. SIRM/ARM values for suspended sediment samples throughout the storm reveal that the initial 'lead flush' is associated with a specific sediment source, namely that of organic sediment eroded from the upper peat layer. Using the magnetic 'fingerprinting' approach to discrimination of sediment sources, this study reveals that erosion of the upper peat layer at UNG is releasing high concentrations of industrially derived lead (and, by inference, other toxic heavy metals associated with industrial particulates) into the fluvial systems of the southern Pennines. Climate-change scenarios for the UK, involving higher summer temperatures and stormier winters, may result in an increased flux both of sediment-associated and,dissolved heavy metals from eroding peatland catchments in the southern Pennines, adversely affecting the quality of sediment and water entering reservoirs of the region.

AB This study compares age estimates of recent peat deposits in 10 European ombrotrophic (precipitation-fed) bogs produced using the C-14 bomb peak, Pb-210, Cs-137, spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs), and pollen. At 3 sites, the results of the different dating methods agree well. In 5 cores, there is a clear discrepancy between the C-14 bomb peak and Pb-210 age estimates. In the upper layers of the profiles, the age estimates of C-14 and Pb-210 are in agreement. However, with increasing depth, the difference between the age estimates appears to become progressively greater. The evidence from the sites featured in the study suggests that, provided aboveground plant material (seeds, leaves) is selected for dating, the C-14 bomb peak is a reliable dating method, and is not significantly affected by the incorporation of old carbon with low C-14 content originating from sources including air pollution deposition or methane produced by peat decomposition. Pb-210 age estimates that are too old may be explained by the enrichment of Pb-210 activity in the surface layers of peat resulting from a hypothesized mechanism where rapidly infilling hollows, rich in binding sites, may scavenge Pb-210 associated with dissolved organic matter passing through the hollow, as part of the surface drainage network. Until further research identifies and resolves the cause of the inaccuracy in Pb-210 dating, age estimates of peat samples based only on Pb-210 should be used with caution.

AB Excavations of deposits filling a dosed basin within glacial drift at Church Moss, Davenham, near Northwich (Cheshire, England) revealed a sequence of Late-glacial and Early Holocene sediments. Analyses of pollen and plant and invertebrate macrofossils were undertaken, together with loss-on-ignition analyses and a programme of AMS radiocarbon dating, to provide a record of changing biostratigraphy and climatic and ecological regimes. The infilling of features identified as frost-cracks in the till flooring the basin gave remains that reflected conditions of extreme cold towards the end of the Devensian. The pollen record from a 3.5 m sequence of peat towards the deepest part of the basin, supported by radiocarbon dates, shows that organic deposition was initiated during the Late-glacial Interstadial and continued into the early part of the Holocene. There was some evidence for a cool episode during the interstadial, with amelioration prior to the rapid onset of the tundra conditions of the Loch Lomond Stadial. Following the stadial, amelioration was rapid. There was evidence from both central and marginal sequences for a mosaic of fen dominated by sedges and often also mosses, with short-lived small pools through much of the succession. Change to terrestrial conditions proceeded intermittently, probably as a result of subsidence caused by solution of underlying salt-bearing strata. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB From the last deglaciation to the Holocene, the Greenland Ice Core (GISP2) delta O-18 records as well as the records of ice-rafted debris on the surface of the North Atlantic have revealed a succession of sudden cooling events on the centennial to millennial scales. However, the temperature proxy records are rarely studied systematically and directly to ensure that this air temperature cooling pattern simultaneously existed in the East Asian Region, in addition to the repeated pattern occurring in the Greater Atlantic Region. A peat cellulose delta O-18 temperature proxy record proximately existing for 14000 years was picked up from the Hani peat in Jilin Province, China. It suggests by comparison that the sudden cooling events, such as the Older Dryas, Inter-Allerod, Younger Dryas, and nine ice-rafted debris events of the North Atlantic, are almost entirely reiterated in the temperature signals of Hani peat cellulose delta O-18. These cooling events show that the repeatedly occurring temperature cooling pattern not only appeared in the North Atlantic Region in the high latitudes, but also in the Northwest Pacific Region in the middle latitudes. The climate change events marking the start of the Holocene Epoch, the Holocene Megathermal, the "8.2 kyr" event, the "4.2 kyr" event, the Medieval Warm Period, and the Little Ice Age are further discussed. The sensitivity response of Hani peat cellulose delta O-18 to the land surface temperature and the reason for the age accuracy of peat cellulose C-14 are also discussed based on the characteristics of the peat bog environment.

AB Fluctuations in bog surface wetness (BSW) over an 86-year period were reconstructed using fine-resolution analyses of testate amoebae, plant macrofossils and peat humification from Fagelmossen, an ombrotrophic bog in western Sweden. Results were compared with local instrumental temperature and precipitation data and reconstructed values of total seasonal water table deficit using an age-depth model based on spheroidal carbonaceous particle analysis and a historically dated, geochemically typed tephra layer. Statistically significant correlations between decadal means of the fine-resolution data and climate parameters lend support to the notion that a climate signal may be present in those data, enhancing confidence in the peat-based record to address pressing research questions on abrupt climate change. All three proxies were correlated most significantly with annual precipitation, plant macrofossils only when correlations were time-lagged by 10 years, suggesting that precipitation, rather than temperature, is the primary driver of the BSW record at Fagelmossen. However, plant macrofossils also correlated significantly with annual temperature when time-lagged by 10 years. The correlation of individual physical and biological proxies with climate parameters on different time-scales, coupled with the significant correlation of plant macrofossil results with annual temperature in addition to annual precipitation, may bring into question the use of composite curves of BSW that combine results from multi-proxy studies. The correlations reported here partly support those from other similar studies, but highlight that regional variability may be greater than previously hypothesised and that it may not be possible to apply a single explanation of climatic forcing where bog surface wetness reconstructions are concerned.

AB Peatland environments provide important ecosystem services including water and carbon storage, nutrient processing and retention, and wildlife habitat. However, these systems and the services they provide have been degraded through historical anthropogenic agricultural conversion and dewatering practices. Effective wetland restoration requires incorporating site hydrology and understanding groundwater discharge spatial patterns. Groundwater discharge maintains wetland ecosystems by providing relatively stable hydrologic conditions, nutrient inputs, and thermal buffering important for ecological structure and function; however, a comprehensive site-specific evaluation is rarely feasible for such resource-constrained projects. An improved process-based understanding of groundwater discharge in peatlands may help guide ecological restoration design without the need for invasive methodologies and detailed sitespecific investigation.
   Here we examine a kettle-hole peatland in southeast Massachusetts historically modified for commercial cranberry farming. During the time of our investigation, a large process-based ecological restoration project was in the assessment and design phases. To gain insight into the drivers of site hydrology, we evaluated the spatial patterning of groundwater discharge and the subsurface structure of the peatland complex using heat-tracing methods and groundpenetrating radar. Our results illustrate that two groundwater discharge processes contribute to the peatland hydrologic system: diffuse lower-flux marginal matrix seepage and discrete higher-flux preferential-flow-path seepage. Both types of groundwater discharge develop through interactions with subsurface peatland basin structure, often where the basin slope is at a high angle to the regional groundwater gradient. These field observations indicate strong correlation between subsurface structures and surficial groundwater discharge. Understanding these general patterns may allow resource managers to more efficiently predict and locate groundwater seepage, confirm these using remote sensing technologies, and incorporate this information into restoration design for these critical ecosystems.

AB For the conservation and restoration of biodiverse rich fens, base-rich and nutrient-poor conditions are vital. In wetlands with artificially stable surface water levels, the re-introduction of temporary water level fluctuations has been postulated to restore the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of fens during inundation and to reduce surface water P-input during episodes with drought. This is the first study testing this hypothesis in large-scale field manipulation experiments in rich fens with threatened rich fen mosses, rich fens with Calliergonella, and poor fens with Sphagnum. Five different experiments were conducted: 2 weeks of raised levels (+ 10 cm) in a floating and a non-floating fen during winter, 2 weeks of high levels in a non-floating fen during summer, and 2 weeks of lowered levels (-15 cm) in a floating and a non-floating fen during summer. For floating fens, both lowered and raised surface water levels in adjacent ditches did not show any effect on water tables, soil ANC or nutrient levels in fens. For non-floating fens, raised surface water levels led to inundation in all vegetation types, without affecting nutrient concentrations or vegetation. Although redox potentials decreased immediately in upper soils, ANC was generally not enhanced in winter due to limited infiltration into the waterlogged soils. In summer, in contrast, ANC increased because accelerated evapotranspiration led to enhanced infiltration of inundation water and higher temperatures resulted in microbial alkalinity generation. Short-term lowering of surface water levels in summer led to lower water tables in non-floating fens, but only when precipitation rates were low. Vegetation, ANC and nutrient concentrations were, however, not affected. The effectiveness of short-term surface water level fluctuation to restore ANC strongly depends on peat buoyancy, water saturation of soils, season and weather conditions. This explains why short-term inundation in winter is often inadequate, while short-term inundation in summer does increase ANC. Short-term droughts do not affect the ANC or nutrient availability. Our results are not only important for the hydrological management of fens, but also have implications for future management since short-term extreme weather events will occur more frequently due to climate change.

AB This study reconstructs a long-term record of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux release from an upland peat catchment in Northern England in order to construct a model of future DOC flux. A structural modelling approach is used to develop models for DOC production in the acrotelm in relation to changing temperature and water table depth. DOC production in the acrotelm is coupled with a description of release of reserves of carbon from the catotelm triggered by enzymic latch mechanisms. The model needs only three parameters to be successfully matched to the data, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of over 90% against the reconstructed catchment record. Model results suggests that the half-life of the effect of drought on the catchment is 11.2 years and that the majority of DOC production comes from the acrotelm/catotelm boundary. Using the calibrated model and predictions of future rainfall and temperature, it is forecast that DOC flux from this peat-covered catchment will increase to 25 tonnes C/km(2) by 2010 at a rate of 0.48-0.88 tonnes C/km(2)/year. These results imply a total DOC flux from UK rivers of 0.88-0.83 Mt C in 2002 and of the order of 1 Mt C by 2010. The implications for terrestrial carbon storage and water treatment are discussed.

AB Wildfire in boreal permafrost peatlands causes a thickening and warming of the seasonally thawed active layer, exposing large amounts of soil carbon to microbial processes and potential release as greenhouse gases. In this study, conducted in the discontinuous permafrost zone of western Canada, we monitored soil thermal regime and soil respiration throughout the 2016 growing season at an unburned peat plateau and two nearby peat plateaus that burned 16 and 9 years prior to the study. Maximum seasonal soil temperature at 40 cm depth was 4 ;C warmer in the burned sites, and active layers were ?90 cm thicker compared to the unburned site. Despite the deeper and warmer seasonally thawed active layer, we found higher soil respiration in the unburned site during the first half of the growing season. We partitioned soil respiration into contribution from shallow and deep peat using a model driven by soil temperatures at 10 and 40 cm depths. Cumulative estimated deep soil respiration throughout the growing season was four times greater in the burned sites than in the unburned site, 32 and 8 g C m(?2) respectively. Concurrently, cumulative shallow soil respiration was estimated to be lower in the burned than unburned site, 49 and 80 g C m(?2) respectively, likely due to the removal of the microbially labile soil carbon in the shallow peat. Differences in deep contribution to soil respiration were supported by radiocarbon analysis in fall. With effects of wildfire on soil thermal regime lasting for up to 25 years in these ecosystems, we conclude that increased loss of deep, old, soil carbon during this period is of similar magnitude as the direct carbon losses from combustion during wildfire and thus needs to be considered when assessing overall impact of wildfire on carbon cycling in permafrost peatlands.

AB Patterns and controls of carbon trace gas emissions from wetlands may vary depending upon the spatial and temporal scale being examined. The factors affecting these emissions are thought to be hierarchically related according to their respective scales of importance. A hierarchical model of processes controlling methane emissions from wetlands is presented and examined here. During the 1990 Northern Wetlands Study (NOWES) methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) fluxes were measured in static chambers along a 100 km transect in the Hudson Bay lowland (HBL). Environmental variables, vegetation abundance, and ecosystem age and structure were also quantified at each sampling site. The findings indicate that CH4 emissions from peatlands (e.g., bogs and fens) and other wetlands (e.g., salt marshes) in the region were low, and were nil or negative (i.e., CH4 uptake) in forests and bog forests dominated by aspen and black spruce. Site to site variations in mean CH4 flux appeared to be most closely related to mean water table and sedge productivity, both of which are intercorrelated. Seasonal changes in CH4 flux tend to follow soil temperature fluctuations. Instantaneous CO2 and CH4 daytime fluxes exhibit a negative correlation, suggesting that photosynthetic assimilation of carbon may be related to CH4 emissions, although the processes of CO2 and CH4 production are occurring at somewhat different temporal scales. No diurnal variations in CH4 flux could be detected. While soil water pH trends rue not fully explored, there is some indication that high CH4 fluxes are concentrated around pH 4 and pH 7. Soil temperature closely follows the seasonal progression of CH4 flux. Estimated CH4 seasonal flux (1.5-3.9 g CH4 m(-2) season(-1)) and estimated aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) (90 - 400 g dry weight m(-2) season(-1)) show systematic changes along a successional sequence which are consistent with patterns predicted from successional theory. Estimated seasonal NMHC emissions (0.5-1.4 g C m(-2) season(-1)) exhibit an increase along the succession from salt marsh to Sphagnum bog communities. Data from several studies were combined to estimate seasonal CO2 flux from three sites. The estimated fluxes range from a net uptake of 23 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1) to a net loss of 77 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1), although there are large uncertainties in these estimates. It is inferred from the assessment of ecosystem age and structure that disturbance effects and successional changes occurring over hundreds to thousands of years in the HBL strongly control regional CH4, CO2, and NMHC emissions by influencing NPP, species composition, community structure, soil (peat) development, and landscape hydrology. Given this, it is likely that models of carbon trace gas flux based on succession models may be useful in predicting climate change-landscape change feedbacks.

AB A detailed investigation into sulphur leaching in peatland headwater catchments in the South Pennines, UK shows that, despite significant reductions in sulphur emissions, sulphur remains a key acidifier. This sulphur can be considered as legacy atmospheric pollution, stored within the peat by processes of dissimilatory sulphate reduction and now being leached into the region's surface waters. Persistently lower water tables at gully edge locations define a thick erosional acrotelm that is vulnerable to aeration, oxidation and flushing throughout the year, and not solely confined to periods of drought. Stream discharge behaves as a two-end member system, whereby pre-event water, rich in DOC and sulphate, is diluted by event water as a result of event water flowing through fast flow pathways such as macropores and overland flow. A rapid increase in water table elevation during the storm and a decrease in elevation after the storm indicate that event water has infiltrated the peat and has then been released into the stream. Streamwaters in peat dominated upland catchments with high densities of gullying have high concentrations of sulphate and low concentrations of DOC, whereas the reverse is true for those catchments with low densities of gullying. This is consistent with the concept that high concentrations of sulphate can suppress the solubility of DOC. A significant store of sulphate exists within South Pennine peats, and continued gully erosion will enhance sulphur leaching meaning that the timescale involved for any depletion is uncertain. It is therefore important that models predicting recovery from acidification in these upland systems include an understanding of how this stored sulphur is being leached, especially with respect to gully erosion, climate change and reduced precipitation.

AB Changes in climate could have far-reaching consequences for ecosystems sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation, such as boreal permafrost peatlands and grassland/woodland boundaries. The Long-term data from our studies in these ecosystems suggest that transient responses of permafrost and vegetation to climate change may be difficult to predict due to lags and positive feedbacks related to vegetation and disturbance. Boreal permafrost peatlands comprise an ecosystem with strong local controls on microclimate that influence the formation and thaw of permafrost. These local controls may preserve permafrost during! the transient stages of climate warming, producing lagged responses. The prairie-forest border region of the northern Great Plains has experienced frequent change and has complex dynamics involving transitions in the grassland composition of prairie and in the degree of woodiness in bordering forests. Fire frequency interacts with fuel loading and tree recruitment in ways that affect the tinting and direction of change. Lags and thresholds could lead to sudden large responses to future climate change that are not readily apparent from current vegetation. The creation of adequate models to characterize transient ecosystem changes will require an understanding of the linkages among processes operating at the scale of 10s of meters and over long time periods.

AB This paper presents the results of multi-proxy research (pollen, plant macrofossil, testate amoebae and bulk density) on a 100-cm core collected from a Baltic raised bog in N Poland. The impact of the variability of the climate as well as human disturbance in the last 650 years on the development of the peat bog Kusowskie Bagno is described. Based on the results, the development of the raised bogs to the south of the southern coast of the Baltic Sea during the Little Ice Age occurred differently than in NW Europe. In NW Europe (e. g., Great Britain, Ireland, Denmark and N Germany) during the periods of climate cooling associated with lower solar activity, there was a characteristic wet phase, whereas N Poland was characterised by a dry phase. In the years AD 1450-1500, AD 1640-1720 and AD 1810-1840, which correlate with the periods of lower solar activity (the Sporer, Maunder and Dalton minima) and the periods of lower temperatures in Europe, the water table in Kusowskie Bagno decreased, and this was followed by changes in the vegetation. The largest drop in the water table occurred in the years AD 1640-1720. The dry phase resulted in the reduction of the population of Archerella flavum and Amphitrema wrightianum, which are organisms that are typical of wet habitats, and the appearance of, e.g., Arcella artocrea and Phryganella acropodia, which are indicators of dry habitats. The humidity decline halted the growth of Sphagnum sec. Cuspidata (Sph. cuspidatum and Sph. balticum) and Sphagnum magellanicum. At the same time, Eriophorum vaginatum, Baeothryon caespitosum and Pinus sylvestris appeared, and a dramatic increase in the bulk density is also observed. Since AD 1720, when the solar activity and the water table increased, the bog regenerated, and the population of Sphagnum fuscum/capillifolium developed. The development of the studied raised bog depended mainly on climate change. The increasing human impact in the area, which started in approximately AD 1320 and lasted for several centuries, was manifested in deforestation and in the increase in the surface area of farmland. However, this result did not have a significant impact on the development of the peat bog. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Permafrost is an important ground thermal condition that has significant biophysical and socio-economic impacts. In order to better understand the distribution and dynamics of permafrost, there is a need to map permafrost at high spatial resolution. This study is part of a research project that aims to model and map permafrost using remote sensing images and the Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature (NEST) model in the central part of the Hudson Bay Lowland in northern Ontario, Canada. The study area is near the southern margin of permafrost region where permafrost exists only in isolated patches. In this study, we ran the NEST model from 1932 to 2012 using a climate data set compiled from station observations and grid data sources. The model outputs were then compared to field observations acquired during 2009-2012 at seven peat monitoring stations and two flux towers, which represent three major types of peatland in the study area (bog, fen, and palsa). The simulated soil temperatures at various depths show good agreement with the observations, and the simulated latent and sensible heat fluxes and net radiation are similar to the observations at the two flux towers. The model accurately shows the existence of permafrost only at palsa sites. Based on the general range of climate and ground conditions in this area, sensitivity tests indicate that the modelled permafrost conditions are sensitive to leaf area index, air temperature, precipitation, and soil texture. Therefore, the NEST model is capable of simulating ground temperature and permafrost conditions in where permafrost occurs only sporadically. A companion paper (part 2) uses the model with Landsat and Radarsat imagery to map the distribution and dynamics of permafrost in this area.

AB Millennial scale variability in the strength/position of the mid-latitude westerlies, as interpreted from rates of dust deposition in an alpine mire south-eastern Australia, is demonstrated to be a major driver of climate variability during the mid to late Holocene. Dust deposition rates were calculated with a trace element provenance model. This approach is capable of distinguishing between sedimentation of local alluvium and genuine deposition of aeolian dust into the studied mire. Low dust deposition from 6500 to 5500 cal. BP occurred during a period of enhanced south-westerly winds which advected moisture into south-eastern Australia resulting in wet conditions. A subsequent dust pulse at 5500-4000 cal. BP is interpreted as a relaxation in south-westerlies resulting in a more arid phase and possibly enhanced climate variability. Reduced dust deposition between 4000 and 2000 cal. BP indicates a return to increased precipitation/moisture in the lower MDB associated with increased south-westerly geostrophic flow. The onset of more arid conditions after 2000 cal. BP implies a reduction in the frequency of precipitation bearing south-westerly winds. A final further significant finding from this study is the identification of a major dust deposition/wind erosion episode coinciding with the onset of European land clearing and agriculture in Australia.

AB Future climate conditions (warmer, wetter) are expected to change aboveground plant communities with linked belowground alterations (e.g. porewater chemistry) that can influence carbon dynamics. The aims of this study were 1) to determine if porewater phenolic compound concentrations reflect the changing aboveground plant community and 2) to elucidate if changes in phenolic compounds alter belowground carbon release.
   We monitored the changes in vegetation biomass, porewater phenolic compound concentrations, respired CO2 and phenol oxidase enzyme activity in 84 intact peatland mesocosms exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2, elevated temperature, and decreased water table conditions in a full factorial design.
   Phenolic compound concentrations were indicative of the vascular plant expansion that occurred under warmer and anaerobic conditions, suggesting that phenolic compounds could be a simple indicator of northern plant community dynamics. Ecosystem CO2 respiration increased with rising phenolic compound concentrations, suggesting that phenolic compounds can decrease microbial carbon use efficiency in northern peatlands.
   Using an aboveground-belowground framework we present a previously unrecognized mechanism influencing northern carbon dynamics; wherein, climate change conditions can restructure the plant community composition in turn increasing porewater phenolic concentrations, which results in decreased microbial carbon use efficiency and enhanced carbon release.

ID CARBON LOSS; LANDSCAPE; WATER; SLOUGH; RIDGE; PEAT
AB Restoration efforts in Florida's Everglades focus on preserving and restoring this unique wetland's natural landscape. Because most of the Everglades is a freshwater peatland, it requires surplus rainfall to remain a peatland. Restoration plans generally assume a stable climate, yet projections of altered climate over a 50-year time horizon suggest that this assumption may be inappropriate. Using a legacy regional hydrological model, we simulated combinations of a temperature rise of 1.5 A degrees C, a +/- A 10 % change in rainfall, and a 0.46 m sea level rise relative to base conditions. The scenario of increased evapotranspiration and increased rainfall produced a slight increase in available water. In contrast, the more likely scenario of increased evapotranspiration and decreased rainfall lowered median water depths by 5-114 cm and shortened inundation duration periods by 5-45 %. Sea level rise increased stages and inundation duration in southern Everglades National Park. These ecologically significant decreases in water depths and inundation duration periods would greatly alter current ecosystems through severe droughts, peat loss and carbon emissions, wildfires, loss of the unique ridge and slough patterns, large shifts in plant and animal communities, and increased exotic species invasions. These results suggest using adaptive restoration planning, a method that explicitly incorporates large climatic and environmental uncertainties into long-term ecosystem restoration plans, structural design, and management. Anticipated water constraints necessitate alternative approaches to restoration, including maintaining critical landscapes and facilitating transitions in others. Accommodating these uncertainties may improve the likelihood of restoration success.

AB Polygonal peatlands are carbon-rich permafrost ecosystems that will likely be significantly affected by climate change. However, studies are often constrained to one measurement per day, which impedes assessments of the temporal variability in carbon fluxes. For this reason, we measured ecosystem respiration (ER) of CO2 in a polygonal peatland underlain by continuous permafrost over an entire growing season to determine the effects of temperature and water table depth on the temporal variability of ER. We used four automated closed chambers to measure ER under varying temperature and soil moisture regimes. Temporal variability was approximately the same for the four plots, on both a diurnal and a seasonal scale. Both diurnal and seasonal variations in ER were strongly controlled by changes in soil surface temperature. Fluctuations of the water table depth associated with important rainfall events was also an important factor affecting ER on the seasonal scale. We found that water table level fluctuations below 20-25 cm did not significantly affect ER and that most soil respiration took place in the top 10 cm, likely in the surface 2 cm. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring future changes in tundra hydrology, which will determine the depth of organic matter available for aerobic decomposition.

AB Peatlands on the Tibetan Plateau play crucial roles in regional carbon cycling but faced serious degradation in recent decades, and hydrological restoration is being conducted to regain their ecosystem function. However, how restoration affects the environmental controls on carbon processes of these unique ecosystems remains unclear, and the role of vegetation community in regulating carbon processes in response to the restoration is unknown. A long dam was built at the outlet of a large shallow lake on the plateau in order to evaluate the effects of hydrological restoration on the carbon sequestration of the world's largest alpine peatlands. The carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from three widely distributed peatland communities, i.e., Kobresia pusilla, Carex enervis, and Carex rnuliensis commuities, were investigated immediately before and after restoration. The water table rising as a consequence of restoration, at least temporarily, decreased the carbon consumption rate (plant respiration plus soil decomposition) for each unit of carbon fixation by plants, which is community dependent. However, a positive relationship between temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and optimal water table for respiration implies a positive feedback between water table rising and warming on R-eco. Meanwhile, the dominant factor explaining the variance of R-eco shifted from soil temperature (explained 56%) to water table (explained 68%) after restoration. Water table rising enhanced the CH4 emissions by 3-12 times, with significantly different changes in CH4 flux over a standard variation in water table level among the communities. Temperature was excluded while only water table and vegetation type were included in the model to predict CH4 fluxes after restoration in contrast to before. We argue that the shift of driving environmental factors and the role of vegetation community are essential in evaluating the effects of hydrological restoration on carbon cycling of Plateau peatlands, particularly during the transitional period.

AB We investigated the impact of climate change on the number of wildfires in the Peak District uplands of northern England. Wildfires in peat can result in severe carbon loss and damage to water supplies, and fighting such fires is difficult and costly in such a remote location. The Peak District is expected to experience warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers. Local weather simulations from a weather generator were used to predict the future incidence and timing of fires. Wildfire predictions were based on past fire occurrence and weather over 27.5 yr. A Probit model of wildfire incidence was applied to simulated weather data, which were generated by a Markov process and validated against actual baseline weather data using statistical criteria and success in replicating past fire patterns. The impact of climate change on the phenology and ecology of moorland and on visitor numbers was considered. Simulations suggest an overall increase in occurrence of summer wildfires. The likelihood of spring wildfires is not reduced by wetter winter conditions; however, the chance of wildfires rises as rainfall decreases. Temperature rise has a non-linear impact, with the risk of wildfire occurrence rising disproportionately with temperature. Recreation use is a major source of ignition. Little change in wildfire incidence is projected in the near future, but as climate change intensifies, the danger of summer wildfires is projected to increase from 2070; therefore, fire risk management will be necessary in future. In addition, moorlands may have to be managed to reduce the chance of summer wildfires becoming catastrophic, with consequent damage to ecosystem services such as water supplies and peat carbon storage. Management measures may include controlled burning, grazing or mowing to remove fuel.

AB [ 1] This study uses a 10-year record of precipitation, soil, and stream concentration of nutrient and carbon species from an upland peat catchment to examine whether or not changes in nutrient inputs can explain long-term increases in DOC flux from peat. The study uses time series analysis and particularly the derivation of impulse response functions to provide an alternative approach to environmental manipulations and experimental additions of nitrogen. The study shows that ( 1) the catchment has a fixed capacity for nitrogen uptake and as such nitrogen flux from the catchment is controlled by precipitation inputs; ( 2) the DOC flux from the catchment shows no relationship with precipitation inputs and flux from the peat itself continues to increase over the period; ( 3) impulse response functions suggest that high DOC concentrations suppress nutrient flux from the catchment and not the other way around; and ( 4) no significant correlation could be found between nutrient time series and the residual of the DOC concentrations after removing the effects of both temperature and changes in water table. The study can find no evidence of a link between nutrient inputs and the release of DOC from the peat profile. The DOC flux corrected for rainfall inputs and the residual time series of regression all show sharp step changes in the DOC release after severe drought.

AB To increase our understanding of long-term climate dynamics and its effects on different ecosystems, palaeoclimatic and long-term botanical reconstructions need to be improved, in particular in underutilized geographical regions. In this study, vegetation, (hydro)climate, and land-use changes were documented at two southeast Lithuanian peatland complexes - Cepkeliai and Rieznytia - for the Late Holocene period. The documentation was based on a combination of pollen, plant macrofossils, peat stratigraphic records, and subfossil trees. Our results cover the last two millennia and reveal the existence of moist conditions in Southern Lithuania between 300 and 500 CE and from 950 to 1850 CE. Conversely, changes towards warmer and/or dryer conditions have been recorded in 100, 600, and 750 CE, and since the 1850s. Significant differences with other Baltic proxies prevent deriving a complete and precise long-term reconstruction of past hydroclimatic variability at the regional scale. Yet, our results provide an important cornerstone for an improved understanding of regional climate change, i.e. in a region for which only (i) few detailed palaeobotanical studies exist and which has, in addition, been considered as (ii) an ecologically sensitive region at the interface between the temperate and boreal bioclimatic zones.

AB QuestionRe-wetting drained peatlands is a common restoration method to reduce carbon loss, but little is known on its likely consequences on reproductive plant development, especially in a warming world. Thus, the aim of this study was to test whether the phenological development of plant species in a peatland ecosystem changed with higher temperatures, increased water table level or a combination of the two.
   LocationFen peatland site in Bavaria, Germany.
   MethodsIn 2010, manipulative experiments with two different treatments (control and warming) and in 2011 with four different treatments (control, warming, increased water table level, warming + increased water table level) were conducted. Temperature was raised 0.4-1.5 degrees C with open-top chambers (OTCs) from August 2009 onwards, and water table level was elevated 12cm using a pumping system, however the latter was not continuous for the whole growing season of 2011 due to technical difficulties. Phenological development of different grassland species was observed weekly using the BBCH code. Attention focused on reproductive phenology (from flower development to fruit senescence) and on key single phenological phases, such as flower development, flowering, ripening and fruit senescence, as well as the duration of key phases. Additionally, vegetation height was measured.
   ResultsOur study showed that higher temperatures advanced reproductive phenology and most key phases, except fruit senescence. Water table manipulations had no significant influence on phenology. The duration of key phases was generally not significantly influenced by treatments, whereas vegetation height differed between control and higher temperature plots.
   ConclusionIn general, raising the water table to reduce carbon release from drained peatland sites will not dramatically affect phenological development of grassland species, whereas increased temperatures will affect reproductive phenology.

AB Northern wetlands with organic soil i.e., mires are significant carbon storages. This key ecosystem service may be threatened by anthropogenic activities and climate change, yet we still lack a consensus on how these major changes affects their carbon sink capacities. We studied how forestry drainage and restoration combined with experimental warming, impacts greenhouse gas fluxes of wetlands with peat. We measured CO2 and CH4 during two and N2O fluxes during one growing season using the chamber method.
   Gas fluxes were primarily controlled by water table, leaf area and temperature. Land use had a clear impact of on CO2 exchange. Forestry drainage increased respiration rates and decreased field layer net ecosystem CO2 uptake (NEE) and leaf area index (LAI), while at restoration sites the flux rates and LAI had recovered to the level of undrained sites. CH4 emissions were exceptionally low at all sites during our study years due to natural drought, but still somewhat lower at drained compared to undrained sites. Moderate warming triggered an increase in LAI across all land use types. This was accompanied by an increase in cumulative seasonal NEE. Restoration appeared to be an effective tool to return the ecosystem functions of these wetlands as we found no differences in LAI or any gas flux components (PMAX, Reco, NEE, CH4 or N2O) between restored and undrained sites. We did not find any signs that moderate warming would compromise the return of the ecosystem functions related to C sequestration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sphagnum mosses are a fundamental component of bog vegetation in northern regions, where these plants play a major role in controlling important ecosystem processes. As heat waves are expected to become increasingly intense and frequent, especially in cold territories, it is important to improve our knowledge of heat resistance in Sphagnum species. We investigated the response to heat stress of S. fuscum and S. magellanicum. Three populations of the two species collected at different altitudes (1090 m, 1870 m and 2100 m) were grown at three daytime temperature levels: 25 degrees C (AT); 36 degrees C (MT); 43 degrees C (HT). The HT treatment decreased concentrations of chlorophyll and nitrogen in the plant tissues, which resulted in lower net CO(2) exchange rates and quantum yield of PS(II). The plants recovered significantly within six days, probably because temperature in the living tissue did not reach lethal thresholds because of the high water content in the plant tissues. Contrary to our main hypothesis, that S. magellanicum had greater resistance to high temperatures because of its more southern distribution, the two species showed much the same response patterns to heat stress. Supporting our second hypothesis, populations of both species originating from the highest site suffered somewhat stronger, although still reversible, damage when grown at HT. Heat stress brought about by heat waves will unlikely have differential effects on these two Sphagnum species. We also conclude that heat waves are unlikely to exert irreversible damage to the Sphagnum layer in bog ecosystems if high temperatures are not coupled with drought. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Reconstruction of hydroclimate variability is an important part of understanding natural climate change on decadal to millennial timescales. Peatland records reconstruct 'bog surface wetness' (BSW) changes, but it is unclear whether it is a relative dominance of precipitation or temperature that has driven these variations over Holocene timescales. Previously, correlations with instrumental climate data implied that precipitation is the dominant control. However, a recent chironomid inferred July temperature record suggested temperature changes were synchronous with BSW over the mid-late Holocene. This paper provides new analyses of these data to test competing hypotheses of climate controls on bog surface wetness and discusses some of the distal drivers of large-scale spatial patterns of BSW change. Using statistically based estimates of uncertainty in chronologies and proxy records, we show a correlation between Holocene summer temperature and BSW is plausible, but that chronologies are insufficiently precise to demonstrate this conclusively. Simulated summer moisture deficit changes for the last 6000 years forced by temperature alone are relatively small compared with observations over the 20th century. Instrumental records show that summer moisture deficit provides the best explanatory variable for measured water table changes and is more strongly correlated with precipitation than with temperature in both Estonia and the UK. We conclude that BSW is driven primarily by precipitation, reinforced by temperature, which is negatively correlated with precipitation and therefore usually forces summer moisture deficit in the same direction. In western Europe, BSW records are likely to be forced by changes in the strength and location of westerlies, linked to large-scale North Atlantic ocean and atmospheric circulation.

AB 1. Although direct contributions of soil invertebrates to carbon turnover are modest, they have a disproportionally large indirect impact through their control over the activity of microbial decomposers. Shifts in soil invertebrate species distribution might have a substantial effect on the decomposition process because their functional role depends on the species' vertical position in soils. Gradients in microclimate and substrate quality and structure largely determine the vertical position of soil invertebrates. Because of the possible impact of climate change on soil invertebrate distribution, and consequently on decomposition, it is important to know the relative contributions of microclimate and substrate quality to the vertical distribution patterns of soil invertebrates.
   2. We studied this for springtails (Collembola) as a keystone group in cool and cold biomes, by turning peat cores in a subarctic blanket bog upside down, thereby reversing the substrate quality gradient and leaving temperature and moisture gradients intact.
   3. Two opposing groups of springtail species could be distinguished with respect to their abundance responses along the vertical gradient: (i) species that remain associated with the stratum they were originally found in ('stayers') and (ii) species that re-establish the original stratification pattern, by remigration either to the top or deeper layers, irrespective of any substrate quality change ('movers'). Within the 'mover' response pattern, the direction of their migration in response to microclimate changes seemed to coincide with their ecomorphological traits.
   4. Our results not only demonstrate that springtail species differ in their responses to changes in climate or substrate quality; they also suggest that interspecific faunal trait variation may provide a useful tool to predict animal responses to climatic changes.

AB Climate change can be expected to increase the frequency of summer droughts and associated low water tables in ombrotrophic peatlands. We studied the effects of periodic water table drawdown in a mesocosm, experiment. Mesocosms were collected in Southern Sweden, and subsequently brought to an experimental field in the Netherlands. Two water table treatments were applied: one with constant water tables at 5 cm below the moss surface, and one in which the water table was allowed to drop, resulting in water tables fluctuating between 5 and 21 cm below the moss surface. Sphagnum growth, as well as Sphagnum and vascular plant abundance, were assessed for 21 years. Our results show that the abundance of graminoid species increased most in the constant water table treatment. In contrast, ericoid species cover increased when water tables were allowed to fluctuate. Furthermore, Sphagnum cuspidatum production decreased with fluctuating summer water tables, while Sphagnum magellanicum responded oppositely. From these results we conclude that increased occurrence of periods with low water tables may bring about a shift in dominant Sphagnum species as well as a shift from graminoid to ericoid vascular plant cover, resembling the shift from hollow to lawn or hummock vegetation. The difference in response within functional groups (vascular plants, Sphagnum) may add to the resilience of the ecosystem. (C) 2008 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB We investigated temporal changes in diet composition of the Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus breeding in natural habitat (calcareous peat bog) in SE Poland. We characterized diet composition in a three-year period (2007-2009), based on pellet analyses. We investigated whether diet composition was affected by years or stage of breeding. We compared diet of the studied population between 2000s and 1990s and with other populations. We found that the food of the studied population was dominated by insects and mammals (by number) and mammals and birds (by biomass). Biomass and abundance of main prey items differed between studied years because of different air temperatures. We found some interannual differences in contribution of some prey items including higher number of thermophilic prey (insects and amphibians) in warmer years. Comparison of pellet composition in the 1990s and 2000s revealed significant increase in the abundance of thermophilic prey (insects and reptiles) and decrease of mammals including Microtus voles and birds. Those changes may be linked to habitat changes in areas neighboring peat bogs and climate change-induced changes in prey communities. The studied population was able to respond to changes in foraging habitats and prey composition by opportunistic foraging on easily available prey. The diet of the studied population is the most similar to the geographically closest populations foraging in similar habitats and characterized by high contribution of insects.

AB Local fire history covering the entire Holocene period at a dry forest site in North Karelia, eastern Finland (ca. 63degrees07'N, 30degrees44'E), was reconstructed on the basis of visible charcoal layers from peat deposits of a small mire basin. Seven points studied along a transect a few metres long provided a record of ancient local forest fires that had scarred the margin of the peat deposit. The charcoal layer records indicate a drastic increase in forest fires about 500 years ago compared with the earlier part of the Holocene period. During the past 500 years, human influence has been extensive in the area, and there have been 9 local fires during that period, while during the previous 9500 years there had been only 34 fires. Between the establishment of spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) 6300 calendar years B.P. and the beginning of significant human influence, the site had burned over at a mean interval of 220-260 years. The data indicate a decrease in fire frequency associated with a warm climate between 9000 and 6300 calendar years BP. This suggests that climatic warming does not necessarily result in increased frequency of forest fires.

AB High arctic wetlands hold large stores of soil carbon (C). The fate of these C stores in a changing climate is uncertain, as rising air temperatures may differentially affect photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration (ER). In this study, open-top warming chambers were used to increase air and soil temperatures in contrasting microtopographic positions of a high arctic fen in NW Greenland. CO2 exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere was measured on 28 dates over a 3-year period. Measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index, leaf and stem growth, leaf-level gas exchange, leaf nitrogen, leaf delta C-13, and fine root production were made to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of observed changes in CO2 exchange. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) increased with chamber warming in hollows, which are characterized by standing water, and in hummocks, which extend above the water table. ER, however, increased only in hummocks, such that net ecosystem exchange (NEE) increased in hollows, but did not change in hummocks with chamber warming. Complementary measurements of plant growth revealed that increases in GEP corresponded with increases in C allocation to aboveground biomass in hummocks and belowground biomass in hollows. Our results and those of several recent studies clearly demonstrate that effects of climate change on the C balance of northern wetlands will depend upon microtopography which, in turn, may be sensitive to climate change.

AB About a fifth of the global wetland methane emissions originate from boreal peatlands, which represent an important land cover type in boreal landscapes in the sporadic permafrost zone. There, rising air temperatures could lead to warmer spring and longer growing seasons, changing landscape methane emissions. To quantify the effect of warmer spring conditions on methane emissions of a boreal peat landscape in the sporadic permafrost zone of northwestern Canada, we analyzed four years (2013-2016) of methane fluxes measured with the eddy covariance technique and long-term (1951-2016) meteorological observations from a nearby climate station. In May, after snowmelt was complete, mean air temperatures were more than 2 degrees C warmer in 2013, 2015, and 2016 than in 2014. Mean growing season (May-August) air temperatures, in contrast, differed by less than 1 degrees C over the four years. WarmerMay air temperatures caused earlier wetland soil warming, with temperatures rising from similar to 0 degrees C to > 12 degrees C 25 to 40 days earlier and leading to similar to 6 degrees C warmer mean soil temperatures between May and June. However, from July to August, soil temperatures were similar among years. Mean May to August and annual methane emissions (6.4 g CH4 m(-2) and 9.4 g CH4 m(-2), respectively) of years with warmer spring (i.e. May) temperatures exceeded emissions during the cooler year by 20%-30% (4.5 g CH4 m(-2) and 7.2 g CH4 m(-2), respectively). Among years with warmer springs, growing season methane emissions varied little (+/- 0.5 g CH4 m(-2)). The observed interannual differences are most likely caused by a strong soil temperature control on methane fluxes and large soil temperature differences during the spring. Thus, in a warming climate, methane emissions from waterlogged boreal peat landscapes at the southern limit of permafrost are likely to increase in response to more frequent occurrences of warm springs.

AB Climate change will have important effects on arctic productivity and greenhouse gas exchange. These changes were projected by the model ecosys under an Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 scenario over the 21st century for a landscape including an upland tundra and a lowland fen at Daring Lake, NWT. Rising temperatures and precipitation caused increases in active layer depths (ALD) and eventual formation of taliks, particularly in the fen, which were attributed to heat advection from warmer and more intense precipitation and downslope flow. These changes raised net primary productivity from more rapid N mineralization and uptake, driven by more rapid heterotrophic respiration and increasing deciduous versus evergreen plant functional types. Consequently, gains in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of 29 and 10gCm(-2)yr(-1) were modeled in the tundra and fen after 90years. However, CH4 emissions modeled from the fen rose sharply from direct effects of increasing soil temperatures and greater ALD on fermenter and methanogenic populations and from indirect effects of increasing sedge growth, which hastened transfer of CH4 through porous roots to the atmosphere. After 90years, landscape CH4 emissions increased from 1.1 to 5.2gCm(-2)yr(-1) while landscape NEP increased from 34 to 46gCm(-2)yr(-1). Positive feedback to radiative forcing from increases in CH4 emissions more than offset negative feedback from increases in NEP. This feedback was largely attributed to rises in CH4 emission caused by heat advection from increasing precipitation, the impacts of which require greater attention in arctic climate change studies.

AB The Maximum Power Principle (MPP) - a theoretical construct that argues that systems develop to maximize energy throughput, or power - is the subject of few empirical studies. We used the MPP to explore the thermodynamic basis for microbial processes and greenhouse gas fluxes in high latitude peat soils. Increasing temperatures cause extensive areas of permafrost degradation, which can lead to wetland formation, though permafrost degradation and aggradation can be cyclical under the right conditions. Differential ecosystem responses to permafrost degradation offer an opportunity to use the unifying approach of thermodynamics. We used adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in peat soils as a soil-relevant proxy for power to test the MPP along a chronosequence of wetlands with time following permafrost degradation. We conducted soil incubation experiments and measured production rates of CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ATP. ATP production was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the young bog soils compared to the undisturbed permafrost bog soils; rates in the older bog soils were not different from either site. Our results suggest that power output increased following recovery from permafrost thaw. A unifying vantage point provided by thermodynamics may be useful in other investigations of wetland ecosystems with unpredictable responses to disturbance.

AB Despite their low primary production, ombrotrophic peatlands have a considerable potential to store atmospheric carbon as a result of their extremely low litter decomposition rates. Projected changes in temperature and nitrogen (N) deposition may increase decomposition rates by their positive effects on microbial activity and litter quality, which can be expected to result in enhanced mass loss and N release from Sphagnum and vascular plant litter. This is the first study that examines the combined effects of increased temperature and N deposition on decomposition in bogs. We investigated mass loss and N release at four bog sites along a gradient from north Sweden to northeast Germany in which both temperature and N deposition increased from north to south. We performed two litterbag experiments: one reciprocal experiment with Eriophorum vaginatum litter and one experiment using recalcitrant (Sphagnum fuscum) and more degradable (Sphagnum balticum) Sphagnum litter collected from the most northern site. We measured mass loss and N release during two (Sphagnum) and three (E. vaginatum) years. The N concentration and decomposability of the E. vaginatum litter did not differ between the sites. Mass loss from E. vaginatum litter increased over the gradient from north to south, but there was no such effect on Sphagnum litter. N loss of all litter types was affected by collection site, incubation site and time and all interactions between these factors. N release in Sphagnum was positively related to N concentration. We conclude that decomposition of vascular plants and Sphagnum litter is influenced by different environmental drivers, with enhanced temperatures stimulating mass loss of vascular plant litter, but not of Sphagnum. Enhanced N deposition increases Sphagnum litter N loss. As long-term consequences of climate change will presumably entail a higher vascular plant production, overall litter decomposition rates are likely to increase, especially in combination with increased temperature.

AB This review presents a synthesis of four decades of palsa studies based on field experiments and observations mainly in Fennoscandia, as well as laboratory measurements. Palsas are peat-covered mounds with a permanently frozen core: in Finnish Lapland, they range from 0.5 to 7 m in height and from 2 to 150 m in diameter. These small landforms are characteristic of the southern margin of the discontinuous permafrost zone. Palsa formation requires certain environmental conditions: long-lasting air temperature below 0 degrees C, thin snow cover, and low summer precipitation. The development and persistence of their frozen core is sensitive to the physical properties of peat. The thermal conductivity of wet and frozen peat is high, and it decreases significantly as the peat dries and thaws. This affects the development of the active layer and makes its response to climate change complex. The insulating properties of dry peat during hot and dry summers moderate the thawing of the active layer on palsas. In contrast, humid and wet weather during the summer causes deep thawing and may destroy the frozen core of palsas. Ice layers in palsas have previously been interpreted as ice segregation features but because peat is not frost-susceptible, the ice layers are now reinterpreted as resulting from ice growth at the base of a frozen core that is effectively floating in a mire.

AB Climate-induced changes in vegetation phenology at northern latitudes are still poorly understood. Continued monitoring and research are therefore needed to improve the understanding of abiotic drivers. Here we used 14 years of time lapse imagery and climate data from high-Arctic Northeast Greenland to assess the seasonal response of a dwarf shrub heath, grassland, and fen, to inter-annual variation in snow-cover, soil moisture, and air and soil temperatures. A late snowmelt and start of growing season is counterbalanced by a fast greenup and a tendency to higher peak greenness values. Snow water equivalents and soil moisture explained up to 77% of growing season duration and senescence phase, highlighting thatwater availability is a prominent driver in the heath site, rather than temperatures. We found a significant advance in the start of spring by 10 days and in the end of fall by 11 days, resulting in an unchanged growing season length. Vegetation greenness, derived from the imagery, was correlated to primary productivity, showing that the imagery holds valuable information on vegetation productivity.

AB Understanding the conditions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) release from thawing peat in the Arctic regions and identifying the pathways of processing DOM by soil and aquatic heterotrophic bacteria are critical in the context of rapid climate change. Until now, experimental approaches did not allow quantitative predictions of temperature and biota effects on carbon release from peat in permafrost-affected aquatic environments. In this study, we incubated frozen peat and its aqueous leachate at various temperatures (4, 25 or 45 degrees C), with and without culturable heterotrophic bacteria Iodobacter sp., extracted from thermokarst lakes, to quantify the release and the removal rate of organic carbon (OC) with time. The metabolic diversity of the native microbial community associated with the substrates involved in OC processing was also characterized. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that, after degradation, the associated bacteria are mostly located in the inner parts of plant cells, and that the degradation of organic matter around bacteria is more pronounced at 4 and 25 degrees C compared to 45 degrees C. The metabolic diversity of heterotrophic bacteria was equally high at 4 and 25 degrees C, but lower at 45 degrees C. Regardless of the microbial consortium (native community alone or with added culturable heterotrophs), both the OC release from peat and the OC removal from peat leachate by bacteria were similar at 4 and 25 degrees C. Very low apparent activation energies of DOM biodegradation between 4 and 25 degrees C (- 4.23 +/- 12.3 kJ mol(-1)) suggest that the short-period of surface water warming in summer would have an insignificant effect on DOM microbial processing. Such duration (1-3 weeks) is comparable with the water residence time in peat depressions and permafrost subsidences, where peat degradation and DOM microbial processing occur. This questions the current paradigm of a drastic effect of temperature rise on organic carbon release from frozen peatlands, and should be considered for modelling short-term climate impacts in these regions.

AB Midlatitude treed bogs represent significant carbon (C) stocks and are highly sensitive to global climate change. In a dry continental treed bog, we compared three sites: control, recent (1-3 years; experimental) and older drained (10-13 years), with water levels at 38, 74 and 120 cm below the surface, respectively. At each site we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and estimated tree root respiration (R-r; across hummock-hollow microtopography of the forest floor) and net primary production (NPP) of trees during the growing seasons (May to October) of 2011-2013. The CO2-C balance was calculated by adding the net CO2 exchange of the forest floor (NEff-R-r)to the NPP of the trees.
   From cooler and wetter 2011 to the driest and the warmest 2013, the control site was a CO2-C sink of 92, 70 and 76 g m(-2), the experimental site was a CO2-C source of 14, 57 and 135 g m(-2), and the drained site was a progressively smaller source of 26, 23 and 13 g CO2-C m(-2). The short-term drainage at the experimental site resulted in small changes in vegetation coverage and large net CO2 emissions at the microforms. In contrast, the longer-term drainage and deeper water level at the drained site resulted in the replacement of mosses with vascular plants (shrubs) on the hummocks and lichen in the hollows leading to the highest CO2 uptake at the drained hummocks and significant losses in the hollows. The tree NPP (including above-and below-ground growth and litter fall) in 2011 and 2012 was significantly higher at the drained site (92 and 83 g C m(-2)) than at the experimental (58 and 55 g C m(-2)) and control (52 and 46 g C m(-2)) sites.
   We also quantified the impact of climatic warming at all water table treatments by equipping additional plots with open-top chambers (OTCs) that caused a passive warming on average of similar to 1 degrees C and differential air warming of similar to 6 degrees C at midday full sun over the study years. Warming significantly enhanced shrub growth and the CO2 sink function of the drained hummocks (exceeding the cumulative respiration losses in hollows induced by the lowered water level x warming). There was an interaction of water level with warming across hummocks that resulted in the largest net CO2 uptake at the warmed drained hummocks. Thus in 2013, the warming treatment enhanced the sink function of the control site by 13 g m(-2), reduced the source function of the experimental by 10 g m(-2) and significantly enhanced the sink function of the drained site by 73 g m(-2). Therefore, drying and warming in continental bogs is expected to initially accelerate CO2-C losses via ecosystem respiration, but persistent drought and warming is expected to restore the peatland's original CO2-C sink function as a result of the shifts in vegetation composition and productivity between the microforms and increased NPP of trees over time.

AB PurposeWetlands have a critical impact on the global carbon cycle. This study aims to investigate the spatial and vertical distribution of the soil organic carbon concentration (SOCc), to identify the differences of SOCc among swamps, marshes, bogs, and fens at a regional scale, and finally to examine the main environmental factors impacting SOCc at different depth intervals within different wetland types located in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM).Materials and methodsA total of 218 soil samples were collected. SOCc was determined by the combustion-oxidation method. To analyze the impacts of wetland type, soil type, mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), evapotranspiration (ET), elevation (EL), and slope (SL) on SOCc, statistical analysis methods were executed, including ANOVA with the Duncan test, Pearson correlations analysis, and the stepwise multiple regressions analysis.Results and discussionThe mean values of SOCc in the 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100-cm intervals were 130.4, 64.2, and 32.6gkg(-1), respectively. The wetland type played an important role in the pattern of SOCc in terms of significant differences (p<0.05) among the different wetland types in the 0-60-cm depth. However, significant differences were not found among different soil types. In terms of the wetland type, the highest SOCc was found in bogs (p<0.05), probably due to the higher MAP and lower MAT. The increased MAP (R-2=0.1369, p<0.01) and decreased MAT (R-2=0.1225, p<0.01) had positive associations on the wetland SOCc. ET (R-2=0.2809, p<0.01), MAP (R-2=0.2025, p<0.01), and EL (R-2=0.0484, p<0.05) were positively correlated with marsh SOCc. Moreover, MAP was positively correlated with the bog SOCc (R-2=0.1296, p<0.01). For vertical patterns, SOCc was higher in the 0-30-cm interval and decreased with depth. The impacts of environmental factors on SOCc decreased with depth for each wetland type. Models were developed to document the relations between the SOCc of marshes and fens and corresponding environmental factors.ConclusionsWetland types largely differed in the soil carbon pools in the GKM of China. The relative importance of environmental factors was different for the SOCc values of various wetland types. To minimize carbon loss into the atmosphere, more protections are required for wetlands, especially in the 0-30-cm depth interval because it contains higher SOCc values and is more vulnerable and less stable than those in the deeper layers.

AB Alpine peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are an important soil carbon pool and are extremely sensitive to global change. Duration of drainage and water table drawdown accelerate peatland degradation because the soil changes from an anaerobic to aerobic environment, and climate warming exacerbates this shift. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of drainage on microbial characteristics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as identify the factors mediating those effects. This study also analyzed whether warming increases the variability of GHG emissions. Watertable drawdown exerted greater influence on microbial communities than duration of drainage did. Watertable drawdown significantly increased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Basidiomycota, and changes in soil microbiota correlated with differences in GHG emissions across three water-table treatments. Longer drainage was associated with lower GHG emission; watertable drawdown decreased emissions of CO2 and CH4, but increased emission of N2O. In addition, high temperature increased CO2 emission by 75% and N2O emission by 42%, without significantly affecting CH4 emission. Structural equation modelling showed that microbes, especially prokaryotes (r = 0.79, p < 0.05 for all), were the primary factor affecting GHG emissions from drained peatlands. Overall, this study indicates that the watertable exerts a greater effect on GHG emissions than duration of drainage, and that warming increases variability of GHG emissions.

AB Branched and isoprenoidal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) membrane lipids have been widely used to reconstruct past climate and environmental change. They are not, however, widely applied to peat deposits and the controls on their distributions in peats remain unclear. Here, we present a high resolution record of branched and isoprenoid GDGT concentrations and distributions from a peat core from the Tibetan Plateau that spans the last 13 kyr, a period characterised by distinct dry and wet periods in the region. The lowest concentrations of total branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) occurred during a presumably dry interval in the mid-Holocene, suggesting that brGDGTs-producing bacteria are less productive under such conditions, perhaps reflecting their putative anaerobic ecology. The mean annual air temperature (MAT) estimates derived from the methylation index of brGDGTs and cyclisation ratio of brGDGTs (MBT'/CBT) are higher than present mean annual temperature in the region and closer to summer temperatures, perhaps due to seasonal production of brGDGTs. The downcore distributions of isoprenoidal and branched GDGTs are dominated by GDGT-0 and brGDGT II, respectively. The high fractional abundances of GDGT-0 in warm and especially wet intervals suggest that these conditions are favourable for some groups of methanogenic archaea. The mid-Holocene dry interval is associated with an increase in the fractional and absolute abundance of crenarchaeol, which could be indicative of enhanced ammonia-oxidising archaeal-mediated nitrogen cycling under these conditions. Taken together, variations of GDGT concentrations in peats appear to document the response of microbial processes to climate change and variations in the biogeochemical environment.

AB Recent climate change on the Antarctic Peninsula is well documented [1-5], with warming, alongside increases in precipitation, wind strength, and melt season length [1, 6, 7], driving environmental change [8, 9]. However, meteorological records mostly began in the 1950s, and paleoenvironmental datasets that provide a longer-term context to recent climate change are limited in number and often from single sites [7] and/or discontinuous in time [10, 11]. Here we use moss bank cores from a 600-km transect from Green Island (65.3 degrees S) to Elephant Island (61.1 degrees S) as paleoclimate archives sensitive to regional temperature change, moderated by water availability and surface microclimate [12, 13]. Mosses grow slowly, but cold temperatures minimize decomposition, facilitating multiproxy analysis of preserved peat [14]. Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) in cellulose indicates the favorability of conditions for photosynthesis [15]. Testate amoebae are representative heterotrophs in peatlands [16-18], so their populations are an indicator of microbial productivity [14]. Moss growth and mass accumulation rates represent the balance between growth and decomposition [19]. Analyzing these proxies in five cores at three sites over 150 years reveals increased biological activity over the past ca. 50 years, in response to climate change. We identified significant changepoints in all sites and proxies, suggesting fundamental and widespread changes in the terrestrial biosphere. The regional sensitivity of moss growth to past temperature rises suggests that terrestrial ecosystems will alter rapidly under future warming, leading to major changes in the biology and landscape of this iconic region-an Antarctic greening to parallel well-established observations in the Arctic [20].

AB Thermal gradient apparatus has been used to study enzyme activity and carbon cycling in peat collected seasonally from a Northern upland peatland. A thermal optimum was observed in the peat where maximum carbon-cycling enzyme activities (phenol oxidase and beta-glucosidase), phenolic compound concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and microbial respiration (CO(2) efflux) were all found in a given season. The thermal optimum for these carbon-cycling processes coincided with the highest ambient soil temperature recorded at the time of peat collection, suggesting microbial acclimation to the external conditions. Under the waterlogged conditions of this experiment, phenol oxidase activites correlated positively with phenolic compounds (winter 0.96, P < 0.01; spring 0.92, P < 0.001; summer 0.94, P < 0.001; autumn 0.88, P < 0.001) and (beta-glucosidase activities with DOC (winter 0.91, P < 0.01; spring 0.85, P < 0.01; summer 0.92, P < 0.001; autumn 0.72, P < 0.05). We propose, therefore, that the relative activities of these enzymes is crucial in mobilising DOC from the peat matrix, with implications for carbon exports to the receiving waters (magnitude and molecular weight distribution) and CO(2) efflux to the atmosphere. The pronounced seasonality in carbon processing found here, must be taken into account when modelling carbon flux in and from these systems, if responses to climate change are to be predicted satisfactorily. Furthermore, because the optimum activity of these carbon-cycling enzymes shifted with seasonal changes in temperature, it is essential to perform enzyme assays in soil ecological investigations at field temperatures (rather than standardised temperatures), when information on natural process rates is required.

AB The Scots pine is one of the most important species in European and Asian forests. Due to a widespread occurrence of pine forests, their significance in the energy and mass exchange between the Earth surface and the atmosphere is also important, particularly in the context of climate change and greenhouse gases balance. The aim of this work is to present the relationship between the average annual net ecosystem productivity and growing season length, latitude and air temperature (tay) over Europe. Therefore, CO2 flux measurement data from eight European pine dominated forests were used. The observations suggest that there is a correlation between the intensity of CO2 uptake or emission by a forest stand and the above mentioned parameters. Based on the obtained results, all of the selected pine forest stands were CO2 sinks, except a site in northern Finland. The carbon dioxide uptake increased proportionally with the increase of growing season length (9.212 g C m(-2) y(-1) per day of growing season, R-2 = 0.53, p = 0.0399). This dependency showed stronger correlation and higher statistical significance than both relationships between annual net ecosystem productivity and air temperature (R-2 = 0.39, p = 0.096) and annual net ecosystem productivity and latitude (R-2 = 0.47, p = 0.058). The CO2 emission surpassed assimilation in winter, early spring and late autumn. Moreover, the appearance of late, cold spring and early winter, reduced annual net ecosystem productivity. Therefore, the growing season length can be considered as one of the main factor affecting the annual carbon budget of pine forests.

AB Peatlands, with organic soils, are usually dominated by one or a few species. Above and belowground ecological processes are regulated by the characteristics of the dominant species in the peat. Understanding how these species relate to climatic or water chemistry gradients will help to predict the fate of those ecosystems under current climate change. The patterns of abundance and occurrence of 12 major peat-forming species from different structural plant groups were quantified along gradients of elevation, precipitation, and water chemistry. The species were distributed in four major structural groups: cushion plants, true mosses, sedges, and Sphagnum mosses. A response curve for each species was built with Generalized Additive Models. Niche breadths, species tolerances, and species optima were estimated using bootstrap resampling. Our results showed that species were limited in their elevational ranges; Sphagnum species were biased toward low to intermediate elevations, sedges, and true mosses to intermediate elevations and cushion plants to very high elevations. Sphagnum species were more likely to occur in sites with low precipitation, while sedges preferred wet sites. Sphagnum species preferred habitats with acidic pH. The species tolerances and optimum distributions are an indication to the vulnerability of the species to changes in their environment. Species with limited tolerances are more vulnerable, such as the narrow elevational distribution of cushion plants or the low pH and narrow tolerances observed for Sphagnum species. Climate and hydrological changes will very possibly affect the distribution of those species forcing changes on ecosystem functioning.

AB Climate change may have profound impacts on the maintenance of peatlands and surface water systems in the sub-humid western Boreal Plain (WBP) of Northwestern Canada. Wetlands in the WBP, whereas significant carbon stocks are sensitive to changes in climate, because in most years potential evapotranspiration (ET) exceeds precipitation. In this study, a dynamic closed chamber technique was used to examine the relative midday (10:00-16:00 h) growing season (April-October) contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration (R-tot) and moss photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, GEP) to net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 at the soil surface of different degrees of spruce forest canopy cover and microtopography (lawn and depression) in two peatland-pond complexes in the WBP, north-central Alberta, Canada. Results demonstrate that Sphagnum lawns showed the greatest amount of uptake, and dominant surface cover plant communities (Sphagnum and feather mosses) were associated more with canopy cover and incident radiation (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) than microclimate and hydrology. Although microclimate and hydrology varied spatially, no major changes in plant communities were observed across microtopographic gradients (lawns and depression). Differences in NEE with hydrology and microclimate were observed between microtopographic units (depression and lawns), but this was not consistent with surface cover plant community types, which makes generalized fluxes in this landscape particularly challenging.

AB The oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) of plant cellulose has been widely used to study ecohydrological processes of ecosystems as well as to reconstruct past climate conditions in terrestrial climate archives. These applications are grounded on a key assumption that the biochemical fractionation during cellulose synthesis is a constant around +27 parts per thousand and is not affected by environmental factors. Here we revisit the influence of temperature on biochemical fractionation factor during cellulose synthesis using a global compilation ofSphagnumcellulose delta O-18 data.Sphagnum(peat mosses) are known for inhabiting waterlogged peatlands and possessing unique physiological strategy in that their cellulose delta O-18 could closely reflect growing-season precipitation delta O-18. Although within-site cellulose delta O-18 variability shows a median standard deviation of 0.7-0.8 parts per thousand resulting from different degrees of evaporative enrichment of(18)O in metabolic leaf water, this evaporative enrichment should be a small quantity due to the external capillary "water buffer" inSphagnummosses. Using site-specific minimum cellulose delta O-18 data that most likely reflect the signal of unevaporated source water, we show that the apparent enrichment factor between cellulose and precipitation delta O-18 increases with decreasing air temperature. In particular, the apparent enrichment factor could reach values as high as +32 parts per thousand when growth temperature is below 5 degrees C. This observational dataset extends the support for the temperature-dependent oxygen isotope fractionation in plant cellulose synthesis previously demonstrated in laboratory experiment, with implications for paleoclimate and plant physiology studies that employ cellulose delta O-18 measurements, particularly in alpine regions.

AB Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in single plant components in Sphagnum peat have a good potential to reveal environmental changes in peat archives. Two peat profiles, covering the past similar to 6000 years, and a Sphagnum hummock from a discontinuous permafrost area in west central Canada were studied in order to evaluate the effect of decomposition rate on isotope records and to assess which plant components are most suitable for climate reconstructions. The stable isotope values from the most recently forming Sphagnum tissues were compared with observational climate data to study the impact of variations in temperature and precipitation on the peat isotopes. Our results show that there is high correlation between delta C-13 values in alpha-cellulose isolated from Sphagnum fuscum stems and summer temperatures, whereas delta O-18 in the plant tissues is controlled by several factors, such as summer precipitation, summer temperature and evaporation. According to our results, decomposition as derived from C/N values and colorimetry does not seem to affect the oxygen and carbon isotope values of alpha-cellulose from Sphagnum fuscum peat significantly. There is, however, a (quasi-) constant offset between the isotope values of branches and stems and between whole plant material and alpha-cellulose, which makes it crucial to select single moss-fractions when past climate and environmental changes are to be derived from the isotope record.

AB A Late Holocene paleoenvironmental record was obtained from the Lagunillas cushion peatland (LP, 27 degrees 12 ' S, 69 degrees 17 ' W), located in the dry Puna of the western Central Andes. Ten radiocarbon dates build the chronology for the last 1800 cal a BP. Analyses of stable isotopes on cellulose (delta O-18(cell), delta C-13(cell)) and geochemical proxies on organic matter (delta C-13(OM), delta N-15(bulk), TOC, TN, LOI, T-535) were conducted to identify major paleoenvironmental changes in this record. Simultaneously, ambient water (delta O-18, delta H-2) and plant samples of the dominant species Oxychloe andina (delta O-18(cell), delta C-13(cell)) reveal insights into modern conditions. The record reveals distinct multi-centennial oscillations of peat layer thickness and delta O-18(cell). Decomposition, changes in the dominating plant species as well as in plant parts (leaves/roots) can be excluded as driving factors for these oscillations. Thus, delta O-18(cell) seems to be externally forced and reflects humidity changes. Around 470 cal a BP a distinct change towards increased humidity occurred, lasting during the Little Ice Age until about 70 cal a BP. Humid conditions prevailed between 1530 and 1270 cal a BP. Increasing delta O-18(cell) values since 30 cal a BP mark a trend towards again increased aridity.

AB The Zoige peatland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the largest alpine peatland in the world, is currently experiencing unprecedented water stress due to climate change and human activities. However, the consequences for emissions of greenhouse gases have not been well studied. We conducted a 40-month in situ field experiment (including deep, shallow and control water table treatments) to examine the effect of drainage on greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O). The results showed that drainage significantly increased the emission rates and the total cumulative emissions of CO2 (i.e., ecosystem respiration) and N2O, and reduced CH4 emissions. However, under drained conditions, the cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O increased significantly during the growing season (May to September) only, whereas the cumulative emissions of CH4 decreased significantly during both the growing season and the non-growing season (October to April). In addition, drainage significantly increased the biomass of aerobic bacteria and methanotrophs. These results indicate that emissions of greenhouse gases in the Zoige peatland are sensitive to short-term drainage and that future studies should consider the response of greenhouse gas fluxes to environmental changes in the non-growing season.

AB P>Climate change in cold biomes not only involves higher summer temperatures, but also warmer springs and more winter precipitation. So far, little is known about species responses to these seasonal components of climate change.
   We experimentally manipulated spring and summer temperatures and winter snow accumulation and temperatures independently in a peatland in sub-arctic Sweden. This yielded six climate scenarios and we studied the responses of the peat moss Sphagnum fuscum, the evergreen dwarf shrubs Empetrum hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia, the deciduous dwarf shrubs Betula nana and Vaccinium uliginosum, the grass Calamagrostis lapponica and the forb Rubus chamaemorus.
   We found substantial interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables that reflect the response of tundra plants to climate change. S. fuscum had the lowest N and P concentrations, with increasing N and P concentrations (and decreasing C/N and C/P ratios) going from evergreen dwarf shrubs, to the grass, deciduous dwarf shrubs and the forb. Leaf N/P ratios varied between 10 and 14 which points to N-limited plant growth.
   The natural abundance of N-15 varied very strongly among species and growth forms. These differences corresponded with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination also differed strongly among species and growth forms, but the absolute differences were relatively small (< 5 parts per thousand). The rank order was: forb and graminoid < moss and evergreen shrubs < deciduous shrubs.
   After 4 years, the effects of realistic climate change manipulations on leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables were idiosyncratic with respect to species and generally small compared to the differences among species and growth forms. At the phenotypic level, spring warming or winter snow addition effects occurred as frequently as summer warming effects.
   This implies that the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have much more impact on plant-mediated nutrient and carbon cycling pathways and rates than climate-change induced phenotypic responses, irrespective of the seasonal timing of these climate changes.

AB Part 1 of this review synthesizes recent research on status and climate vulnerability of freshwater and saltwater wetlands, and their contribution to addressing climate change (carbon cycle, adaptation, resilience). Peatlands and vegetated coastal wetlands are among the most carbon rich sinks on the planet sequestering approximately as much carbon as do global forest ecosystems. Estimates of the consequences of rising temperature on current wetland carbon storage and future carbon sequestration potential are summarized. We also demonstrate the need to prevent drying of wetlands and thawing of permafrost by disturbances and rising temperatures to protect wetland carbon stores and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services. Preventing further wetland loss is found to be important in limiting future emissions to meet climate goals, but is seldom considered. In Part 2, the paper explores the policy and management realm from international to national, subnational and local levels to identify strategies and policies reflecting an integrated understanding of both wetland and climate change science. Specific recommendations are made to capture synergies between wetlands and carbon cycle management, adaptation and resiliency to further enable researchers, policy makers and practitioners to protect wetland carbon and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services.

AB Organic-rich wetland soils in the histosol soil order represent the largest soil carbon (C) pool globally. Carbon accumulation in these ecosystems is largely due to oxygen (O-2) limitation of decomposition. Increased O-2 availability from wetland drainage and climate change may stimulate C decomposition overall and affect the balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) greenhouse gas release. Characterizing relationships, including non-linearity, between soil O-2 and C gas emissions is therefore critical to predict the partitioning and rate of C release from histosols under greater O-2 availability. We varied gas-phase O-2 concentration from 0.03 to 20 % in incubations of a sapric histosol and measured resulting CO2 and CH4 emissions. Efflux of CO2 increased and CH4 emissions decreased at higher O-2 concentrations, and rates were best described by log-linear model fits. The non-linear response of CO2 and CH4 emissions to O-2 concentration indicates that moist, C rich histosols may be highly sensitive to increases in O-2 availability, even below concentration thresholds typically classified as anoxic.

AB Field observations show significant impacts of wildfires on active layer thickness and ground temperatures. However, the importance of fires to permafrost conditions at regional scales remains unclear, especially with climate warming. This study evaluated the regional impacts of fire on permafrost with climate change from 1942 to 2100 using a process-basedmodel in a large subarctic region in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Climate warming is shown to be the dominant factor for permafrost reduction. The warming trend of climate reduces permafrost extent in this region from 67% at present to 2% by 2100. For burned areas, fire increases the reduction of permafrost extent by up to 9% on average, with up to 16% for forest, 10% for tundra and bogs, and 4% for fens. Fire accelerates permafrost disappearance by 5 years on average. The effects of fire on active layer thickness and permafrost extent are much larger in forest areas than in tundra, bogs, and fens. Since active layer is thicker after a fire and cannot recover in most of the areas, the fire effects on active layer are widespread. On average, fires thickens active layer by about 0.5 m. The fire effects on active layer increased significantly after 1990 due to climate warming.

AB In future, grass swards need to be adapted to climate change and interactions of management and site are becoming more important. The persistence of Lolium perenne on peatland or during dry periods is limited and alternative forage species are required. We tested the performance of a modern variety of Festuca arundinacea and Phleum pratense as an alternative to Lolium perenne on clay, peat, and sandy soils. Each of these grasses was sown as main species in mixture with Poa pratensis and Trifolium repens and the mixtures were subjected to different frequencies of defoliation. Differences in yield proportions in the third year were significantly influenced by main species, site and their interaction. Remaining mass proportions of main species after three years were smallest on peat; on all sites Festuca arundinacea showed the highest persistence and largest yield, followed by Lolium perenne. Mass proportions of Phleum pratense were small on peat soils and Phleum had been replaced there by Holcus lanatus, and by Lolium perenne and Poa pratensis on the clay and sandy soils. We conclude that the choice of grass species in mixtures is a management tool to control stability and productivity of grass swards under specific site conditions.

ID METHANE FLUX; CLIMATE CHANGE; PEATLANDS; INCREASE; WETLANDS
AB In this paper we present a model that can reconstruct water table position and soil temperature profiles to 3 m depth in boreal mixed mire systems using the readily available climate data on air temperature and precipitation as driving variables. The model simulates complete, multiple annual cycles including winter conditions and freeze-thaw processes. The major requisite for an accurate description of the soil heat flux in a mire is an accurate description of the water content of the profile because of the high porosity of the soil and the thermal properties of water. The soil moisture profile in this model is described as a function of water table position derived from empirical published data of soil moisture profile measurements at different water table positions. The parameters of the model were set and tested for a lawn community, one of the most dominant plant communities occurring in boreal mixed mires. The model is optimized for the period 1995-1997 at the mixed mire Degero Stormyr and was validated for the period 1997-1998 at the same location and for 1991-1993 at Storamyran, 60 km away. The mean deviation of simulated to measured soil temperature from 10 cm to 3 m depth in the validation data sets was <1.6 degrees C with a maximal standard deviation of 1.8 degrees C. A response analysis of the amount of winter precipitation showed the influence of snow cover depth on soil frost fluctuations. A simulated precipitation corresponding to 25% of the measured precipitation during winter 1995-1996, with all other factors unchanged, prolonged the period of frozen ground in the model from June 8 to August 1. With a doubling of the winter precipitation the modeled period of frozen ground lasted only until May 6.

AB Boreal peatlands are significant natural sources of methane and especially vulnerable to abrupt climate change. However, the controlling factors of CH4 emission in boreal peatlands are still unclear. In this study, we investigated CH4 fluxes and abiotic factors (temperature, water table depth, active layer depth, and dissolved CH4 concentrations in pore water) during the growing seasons in 2010 and 2011 in both shrub-sphagnum-and sedge-dominated plant communities in the continuous permafrost zone of Northeast China. The objective of our study was to examine the effects of vegetation types and abiotic factors on CH4 fluxes from a boreal peatland. In an Eriophorum-dominated community, mean CH4 emissions were 1.02 and 0.80 mg m(-2) h(-1) in 2010 and 2011, respectively. CH4 fluxes (0.38 mg m(-2) h(-1)) released from the shrub-mosses-dominated community were lower than that from Eriophorum-dominated community. Moreover, in the Eriophorum-dominated community, CH4 fluxes showed a significant temporal pattern with a peak value in late August in both 2010 and 2011. However, no distinct seasonal variation was observed in the CH4 flux in the shrub-mosses-dominated community. Interestingly, in both Eriophorum- and shrub-sphagnum-dominated communities, CH4 fluxes did not show close correlation with air or soil temperature and water table depth, whereas CH4 emissions correlated well to active layer depth and CH4 concentration in soil pore water, especially in the Eriophorum-dominated community. Our results suggest that CH4 released from the thawed CH4-rich permafrost layer may be a key factor controlling CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands, and highlight that CH4 fluxes vary with vegetation type in boreal peatlands. With increasing temperature in future climate patterns, increasing active layer depth and shifting plant functional groups in this region may have a significant effect on CH4 emission.

AB Palsa mires are mire complexes that occur in the Northern Hemisphere, representing one of the most marginal permafrost features at the outer limit of the permafrost zone. A climate-based spatial model is presented for the distribution of palsa mires in northern Europe. The model is based on an extensive spatial data of palsa mires and climatological variables from 1913 grid cells in an area of c. 240 000 km(2). Generalized linear modelling (GLM) with curvilinear and interaction terms is used to derive the palsa mire-climate relationships. The final model correctly classified 77(.)6 per cent of the palsa mire presence squares. The results indicate a positive association of the distribution of palsa mires with increasing frost number and continentality, whereas precipitation and temperature showed a negative correlation with the distribution of palsa mires. Additionally, interaction of thawing degree days and summer time precipitation showed a negative association. Climatologically, the optimum areas of palsa mires occur in areas of low precipitation (<450 mm) and a mean annual temperature between -3 degreesC and -5 degreesC. Potential reasons for the performance of the model and the sensitivity of palsa mires to climate change are discussed. The application of a GIS-based generalized linear modelling as used here provides a versatile method to study the distribution of different geomorphological phenomena across climatological gradients.

AB Land cover changes can impact the climate by influencing the surface energy and water balance. Naturally treeless or sparsely treed peatlands were extensively drained to stimulate forest growth in Finland over the second half of 20th century. The aim of this study is to investigate the biogeophysical effects of peatland forestation on regional climate in Finland. Two sets of 18-year climate simulations were done with the regional climate model REMO by using land cover data based on pre-drainage (1920s) and post-drainage (2000s) Finnish national forest inventories. In the most intensive peatland forestation area, located in the middle west of Finland, the results show a warming in April of up to 0.43K in monthly-averaged daily mean 2m air temperature, whereas a slight cooling from May to October of less than 0.1K in general is found. Consequently, snow clearance days over that area are advanced up to 5 days in the mean of 15 years. No clear signal is found for precipitation. Through analysing the simulated temperature and energy balance terms, as well as snow depth over five selected subregions, a positive feedback induced by peatland forestation is found between decreased surface albedo and increased surface air temperature in the snow-melting period. Our modelled results show good qualitative agreements with the observational data. In general, decreased surface albedo in the snow-melting period and increased evapotranspiration in the growing period are the most important biogeophysical aspects induced by peatland forestation that cause changes in climate. The results from this study can be further integrally analysed with biogeochemical effects of peatland forestation to provide background information for adapting future forest management to mitigate climate warming effects. Moreover, they provide insights about the impacts of projected forestation of tundra at high latitudes due to climate change.

AB We characterized peat decomposition at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), Minnesota, USA, to a depth of 2m to ascertain the underlying chemical changes using Fourier transform infrared (FT IR) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy) and related these changes to decomposition proxies C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15, bulk density, and water content. FT IR determined that peat humification increased rapidly between 30 and 75cm, indicating a highly reactive intermediate-depth zone consistent with changes in C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15, bulk density, and water content. Peat decomposition at the MEF, especially in the intermediate-depth zone, is mainly characterized by preferential utilization of O-alkyl-C, carboxyl-C, and other oxygenated functionalities with a concomitant increase in the abundance of alkyl- and nitrogen-containing compounds. Below 75cm, less change was observed but aromatic functionalities and lignin accumulated with depth. Significant correlations with humification indices, identified by FT IR spectroscopy, were found for C:N ratios. Incubation studies at 22 degrees C revealed the highest methane production rates, greatest CH4:CO2 production ratios, and significant O-alkyl-C utilization within this 30 and 75cm zone. Oxygen-containing functionalities, especially O-alkyl-C, appear to serve as excellent proxies for soil decomposition rate and should be a sensitive indicator of the response of the solid phase peat to increased temperatures caused by climate change and the field study manipulations that are planned to occur at this site. Radiocarbon signatures of microbial respiration products in deeper pore waters at the MEF resembled the signatures of more modern dissolved organic carbon rather than solid phase peat, indicating that recently photosynthesized organic matter fueled the bulk of subsurface microbial respiration. These results indicate that carbon cycling at depth at the MEF is not isolated from surface processes.

AB Climate warming and vegetation composition change are expected to influence greenhouse gas emissions from boreal peatlands. However, the interactive effects of warming and different vegetation compositions on N2O dynamics are poorly known, although N2O is a very potent greenhouse gas. In this study, manipulated warming and vegetation composition change were conducted in a boreal peatland to investigate the effects on N2O fluxes during the growing seasons in 2015 and 2016. We did not find a significant effect of warming treatment and combination treatments of warming and vegetation composition change on N2O fluxes. However, sedge removal treatment significantly increased N2O emissions by three-fold. Compared with the treatment of shrub and sedge removal, the combined treatment of warming and shrub and sedge removal significantly increased N2O consumption by five-fold. Similar to N2O fluxes, the cumulative N2O flux increased by similar to 3.5 times under sedge removal treatment, but this effect was not significant. In addition, the results showed that total soil nitrogen was the main control for N2O fluxes under combinative treatments of warming and sedge/shrub removal, while soil temperature and dissolved organic carbon were the main controls for N2O release under warming combined with the removal of all vascular plants. Our results indicate that boreal peatlands have a negligible effect on N2O fluxes in the short-term under climate change, and environmental controls on N2O fluxes become increasingly important under the condition of warming and vegetation composition change.

AB Climate and land-use changes are going to leave an indelible mark on the hydrology and globally significant peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada. With forecasts for warmer and drier conditions over the next century, the relative contribution of water from surface and subsurface sources affecting both water quantity and quality will undoubtedly shift. Unfortunately, no empirical data exist for any streams or rivers of the HBL on the relative contributions of surface water and groundwater to streamflow, making assessment of future change difficult. Here we report the first data on sources of water to streams and rivers across a range of catchment sizes in the James Bay Lowland (JBL) ecoregion of the HBL. Solute chemistry was determined for a range of potential end members, end members were identified, and a chemical mixing model approach was used to determine the relative end-member contributions to streamflow across a range of catchment sizes (similar to 30-2000 km(2)). The relative contributions of bedrock-derived groundwater to streamflow increased with catchment area from <20 to >40% under dry conditions, and were similar to 50% lower under wet conditions across all catchments. Runoff contributions from peatlands were relatively constant over space and time (53-67%), but the fraction of streamflow composed of rain and snowmelt varied dramatically between wet and dry periods, and among catchments. Given the importance of peatland-derived surface waters, future changes in precipitation and temperature could have significant implications for streamflow in the JBL, particularly during summer base-flow conditions. Moreover, the definition of reference catchments for baseline/impact monitoring must be carefully considered, given the potential for variation in hydrochemistry across physiographically similar catchments.

AB We here preset a result of high-resolution pollen data of a lacustrine-peat sediment core from Yushenkule (YSKL) Peat, southern Altai Mountains, northwestern China. We aim to reconstruct the palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate variations in the southern Altai Mountains and further evaluate the role of autogenic process of the raised bog itself in driving the local vegetation dynamics. The pollen data of YSKL core-2 show two major vegetation stages in YSKL Peat area and the surrounding areas during the data-covering period. During the stage lasting from similar to 4870 to similar to 2550 cal. yr BP, regional vegetation was dominated by desert steppe and local vegetation in YSKL Peat was characterized by Artemisia-dominated mountain steppe. During the stage lasting from similar to 2550 to similar to 700 cal. yr BP, regional vegetation was characterized by Artemisia-dominated steppe and local vegetation in YSKL Peat was characterized by Cyperaceae-dominated wetland herbs. The Ar/Am (Artemisia/Amaranthaceae) ratio-indicated moisture increasing trend of southern Altai Mountains can attribute to the combined effects of decreased temperature and increased precipitation. The lithologic transition from lake to peat of YSKL core-2 can be explained by invoking the variations in the areal extent of ice covers in the Altai Mountains.

AB A high resolution core (9.7 yr cm(-1)) from the Chao de Veiga Mol raised bog (NW Iberian Peninsula) was analyzed to identify plant macrofossils, estimate peat humification and calculate hydroclimatic indices based on current bog species, with the overall aim of determining the climate conditions associated with evolution of the bog during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. These proxies, together with historical and climate data, proved to be good indicators of the changes in bog surface wetness.
   Analysis: of the core led to identification of 9 different periods: two corresponding to the so-called Medieval Climate Anomaly (930 to 1345 AD, 1075-665 calibrated years before present [cal. yr BP]); four corresponding to the Little Ice Age (1345 to 1905 AD; 665-105 cal yr BP); and three corresponding to the last century (1905 to 2000 AD). The findings revealed a generally dry climate that lasted until the 14th century, followed by a transition to a long period with a more humid, but characteristically very variable climate, which ended at the beginning of the 20th century and was followed by a rapid transition to more humid conditions and finally, a change to drier conditions.
   The Medieval Climate Anomaly was indicated by the abundance of dry-adapted mosses (Leucobryum glaucum, Hypnum cupressiforme) and characterized by warm dry conditions and high levels of peat humification, with alternating wet phases. The LIA period was dated by a large abundance of Sphagnum species (an indicator of wetness) and a gradual increase in the humification index. However, four different climate phases were differentiated in this period.
   High-resolution reconstruction of the evolution of the CVM bog and the multiproxy approach have together enabled a more detailed identification of climatic variations in this area, which are generally consistent with the global models, as well as better definition of the elusive climatic oscillations in the last millennium and confirmation of the importance of local modulation of global models.
   The study provides new information and a detailed chronology of climatic events that will help to refine local modulation of the climate evolution model in the still quite unexplored region of the NW Iberian Peninsula, a key area for understanding the paleoclimatic dynamics in SW Europe.

AB Soil porewaters are a vital component of the ecosystem as they are efficient tracers of mineralweathering, plant litter leaching, and nutrient uptake by vegetation. In the permafrost environment, maximal hydraulic connectivity and element transport from soils to rivers and lakes occurs via supra-permafrost flow (i.e. water, gases, suspended matter, and solutes migration over the permafrost table). To assess possible consequences of permafrost thaw and climate warming on carbon and Green House gases (GHG) dynamics we used a "substituting space for time" approach in the largest frozen peatland of theworld. We sampled stagnant supra-permafrost (active layer) waters in peat columns of western Siberia Lowland (WSL) across substantial gradients of climate (-4.0 to -9.1 degrees C mean annual temperature, 360 to 600 mm annual precipitation), active layer thickness (ALT) (N300 to 40 cm), and permafrost coverage (sporadic, discontinuous and continuous). Weanalyzed CO2, CH4, dissolved carbon, and major and trace elements (TE) in 93 soil pit samples corresponding to several typical micro landscapes constituting theWSL territory (peat mounds, hollows, and permafrost subsidences and depressions). We expected a decrease in intensity of DOC and TE mobilization from soil and vegetation litter to the suprapermafrost waterwith increasing permafrost coverage, decreasing annual temperature and ALT along a latitudinal transect from 62.3 degrees N to 67.4 degrees N. However, a number of solutes (DOC, CO2, alkaline earth metals, Si, trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates, and micronutrients (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, V, Mo) exhibited a northward increasing trend with highest concentrations within the continuous permafrost zone. Within the "substituting space for time" climate change scenario and northward shift of the permafrost boundary, our results suggest that CO2, DOC, and many major and trace elements will decrease their concentration in soil supra-permafrost waters at the boundary between thaw and frozen layers. As a result, export of DOC and elements from peat soil to lakes and rivers of the WSL (and further to the Arctic Ocean) may decrease. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Approximately one-third of northern peatlands are within permafrost regions. Soil organic matter (SOM) and plant root biomass in permafrost peatlands are vulnerable to future global warming. However, previous studies have primarily focused on the response of SOM mineralization to increases in temperature without analysing the potential interaction effects of increased plant root biomass. This study investigated the influence of temperature and root additions on soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization as well as the mechanisms driving mineralization in a high latitude permafrost peatland in the Da Xing'an Mountains, Northeast China. We investigated changes in shallow soil (0-15 cm) and deep soil (15-30 cm) carbon mineralization, available N contents, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and enzyme activities in response to increasing temperature and Eriophorum vaginatum root additions by using an incubation experiment. Our results indicate that elevated temperature significantly increased soil carbon mineralization. The Q(10) values of the carbon mineralization rates in the shallow soil and deep soil were 3.95 and 2.91, respectively. In contrast, the soil MBC and DOC decreased significantly, confirming that labile carbon is the main driving force of microbial mineralization activities under warming conditions. Elevated temperature significantly increased the shallow soil net N mineralization rates and increased the net nitrification rates in both soil layers. At high temperatures, ammonification rates increased in the shallow soil but decreased in the deep soil. The increase in the incubation temperature resulted in significantly increased shallow soil beta-glucosidase activity and decreased invertase activity. This suggests the increased production of complex substrate enzymes, and decreased production of simple substrate-acquiring enzymes. The root additions significantly increased the soil C mineralization and stimulated the secretion of invertase by soil microorganisms. These findings indicate that future climate warming in the northern high latitude will significantly stimulate soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization in permafrost peatlands. Furthermore, increases in plant roots will enhance C accumulation and may even enhance the response of soil C mineralization to temperature, significantly impact the soil C balance in high latitude permafrost peatlands.

AB Biomonitoring tools are useful to assess the impact of environmental changes on the functioning of ecosystems. Existing tools mostly require species identification, thus allowing to estimating changes in biodiversity, and possibly inferring ecosystem functioning, using functional diversity and traits based approaches.
   Testate amoebae are good indicators of surface moisture conditions in Sphagnum peatlands and are routinely used in palaeoecology. Their shells (tests), on which identification is based, can also be used to define functional traits and thus to infer changes in ecosystem functioning.
   We investigated the response of testate amoeba communities to manipulated water table depth (wet: 4 cm, intermediate: -15 cm, and dry: -25 cm) over time (seven time points, 19 months) using mesocosms by comparing two approaches: community structure and functional traits responses, using a combination of morphological (biovolume, length, aperture size and position) and physiological (mixotrophy/heterotrophy, shell material) traits.
   This is the first study investigating the effect of water table depth on testate amoeba assemblages over time using a mesocosm approach. Taxonomical and functional approaches showed similar response patterns, confirming that water level acted as a strong environmental filter. After one year Hyalosphenia papilio decreased in the dry treatment, and the community structure shifted towards a dominance of dry indicators (Nebela tincta complex, Corythion dubiurn, Euglypha compressa) and the selected functional traits (smaller, heterotrophic, compressed species, with a ventral aperture) corresponded to drought adaptations.
   In line with recent observational and transfer function studies exploring the use of testate amoebae functional traits, our experimental results illustrate how well-selected traits could be used to monitor the impact of present and past climatic changes on Sphagnum peatlands.

AB Demand for water from catchments dominated by upland peat as a source of drinking water supplies in the UK is likely to increase in the future as demand per capita continues to rise (Thomsen 1990) and/or summer droughts increase in frequency (Arnell 1992). Concern has been expressed in recent pears over rising colour levels (related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron (Fe)) from such catchments (e.g. Kay et al. 1989) causing reduced drinking water quality. One of the major causes of increased DOC concentrations is rewetting following periods of relative drought (Mitchell & McDonald 1992). Experimental rewetting of a naturally drained wetland in Mid-Wales over four years was found to substantially increase the concentrations of DOC, and Fe in the pore-water, with peak values of >60 mg dm(-3) (Fe) and >300 mg dm(-3) (DOC) after rewetting, compared with typical values of <1 mg dm(-3) (Fe) and <15 mg dm(-3) (DOC) under the drained conditions. Seasonal peak concentrations of Fe and DOC have since remained at these higher levels. Rewetting produced a selective enrichment of the >5000 to <90 000 apparent molecular weight (AMW) material and this fraction was found to yield peak Fe concentrations. Two additional peaks of DOC mere also found in the experimental wetland (not present in the control wetland), of >90 000 to <200 000 AMW and >200 000 AMW material. The AMW spectrum of DOC in the experimental wetland changed with season, and the >90 000 to <200 000 AMW fraction could only be seen in spring, representing a transient pool of carbon that is rapidly transformed in or transported from the wetland. These findings suggest that rewetting of peatland following drought (e.g, due to climate change) has the potential to reduce water quality. Moreover, recent interest in restoration (rewetting) of drained peatlands (Wheeler & Shaw 1995) could create an additional source of DOC rich water.

AB In this study, a process-based model (RCG-C) was developed, parameterized and calibrated for studying the annual and seasonal dynamics of the ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a cutaway peatland (Linnansuo, eastern Finland) cultivated with a perennial bioenergy crop (Phalaris arundinaceae, L., RCG). Based on a number of prior studies and an environmentally controlled experiment, RCG-C emphasized several key processes beyond the generality of previous diplotelmic models for pristine peatlands. These processes included the effects of management (e.g., drainage, peat extraction, tilling, harvesting and fertilization) on the soil hydrology and the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, the influence of climatic factors on photosynthesis and the phenological cycle and phenological and soil-moisture controls on biomass production and canopy development. The model was validated based on continuous measurements of meteorological parameters, energy and CO2 fluxes (eddy covariance system) performed at the site from 2005 to 2010, including variation associated with both wet and dry years. The results showed that the model captured the seasonal and annual trends of the latent heat flux and NEE during the six-year period. Moreover, the simulated values for the total C sink capacity, accumulation of rhizome biomass and peat formation from RCG obtained during the six-year period also agreed well with the field measurements. Based on the FINADAPT climate scenarios, a sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the potential increases in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) and air temperature (Ta) could be the main forces driving the changes in NEE. The model simulation suggested that the effects of Ta tend to offset those of Ca and lead to a decrease in the total C sink capacity of the site during the main rotation period (4-15th year of cultivation). This decrease tends to become more intensive toward the end of the 21st century. During the period from 2060 to 2099, the total CO2 sink capacity could decrease by 79% during the main rotation period at the Linnansuo site. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The carbon (C) pool of permafrost peatland is very important for the global C cycle. Little is known about how permafrost thaw could influence C emissions in the Great Hing'an Mountains of China. Through aerobic and anaerobic incubation experiments, we studied the effects of permafrost thaw on CH4 and CO2 emissions. The rates of CH4 and CO2 emissions were measured at - 10, 0 and 10 degrees C. Although there were still C emissions below 0 degrees C, rates of CH4 and CO2 emissions significantly increased with permafrost thaw under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The C release under aerobic conditions was greater than under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that permafrost thaw and resulting soil environment change should be important influences on C emissions. However, CH4 stored in permafrost soils could affect accurate estimation of CH4 emissions from microbial degradation. Calculated Q(10) values in the permafrost soils were significantly higher than values in active-layer soils under aerobic conditions. Our results highlight that permafrost soils have greater potential decomposability than soils of the active layer, and such carbon decomposition would be more responsive to the aerobic environment (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding the spatio-temporal variability of controls on peatland carbon (C) cycling is essential to project the effects of future environmental change. While there is understanding of individual drivers of C cycling, the effect of multiple drivers, including interactions, remains poorly understood. Using a spatially and temporally explicit sampling framework, we examined the effects of biotic and abiotic controls on key indicators of peatland functioning: ecosystem respiration (R (eco)), photosynthesis (P (cal)), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), methane (CH4) fluxes, and pore water dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]). Measurements were made over 12 months in a blanket peatland hosting a wind farm in Scotland, UK. Overall, we found that (i) season and plant functional type (PFT) explained most variation in R (eco) and P (cal), (ii) PFT and spatial location within the wind farm, which integrates several peat properties, were dominant predictors of CH4 fluxes, and (iii) season and location within the wind farm correlated with pore water [DOC]. Examination of predictors indicated that interactions, between and within biotic and abiotic factors, explained a significant amount of variation in greenhouse gas fluxes and [DOC]. These findings indicate that combinations of biotic and abiotic factors could mediate or exacerbate the effects of future environmental change on peatland C cycling. Given this, studies of C cycling need to capture the spatial and temporal variance of biotic and abiotic factors and their interactions to project the likely impacts of environmental change.

AB The prediction of methane emissions from high-latitude wetlands is important given concerns about their sensitivity to a warming climate. As a basis for the prediction of wetland methane emissions at regional scales, we coupled the variable infiltration capacity macroscale hydrological model (VIC) with the biosphere-energy-transfer-hydrology terrestrial ecosystem model (BETHY) and a wetland methane emissions model to make large-scale estimates of methane emissions as a function of soil temperature, water table depth, and net primary productivity (NPP), with a parameterization of the sub-grid heterogeneity of the water table depth based on TOPMODEL. We simulated the methane emissions from a 100 km x 100 km region of western Siberia surrounding the Bakchar Bog, for a retrospective baseline period of 1980-1999 and have evaluated their sensitivity to increases in temperature of 0-5 degrees C and increases in precipitation of 0-15%. The interactions of temperature and precipitation, through their effects on the water table depth, played an important role in determining methane emissions from these wetlands. The balance between these effects varied spatially, and their net effect depended in part on sub-grid topographic heterogeneity. Higher temperatures alone increased methane production in saturated areas, but caused those saturated areas to shrink in extent, resulting in a net reduction in methane emissions. Higher precipitation alone raised water tables and expanded the saturated area, resulting in a net increase in methane emissions. Combining a temperature increase of 3 degrees C and an increase of 10% in precipitation to represent climate conditions that may pertain in western Siberia at the end of this century resulted in roughly a doubling in annual emissions.

AB We examined evidence of past vegetation, climate, and disturbance history in a sediment core from a bog on the windward slope of the Cordillera Central in the Dominican Republic. The sediments revealed a continuous 4000 cat yr history of pine (Pinus occidentalis) dominance and fire. Bog formation may have been linked with a regional shift toward wetter conditions seen at other highland sites around 4000 cat yr BP. Low pollen influx, low organic content, and poor pollen preservation suggested periodic drying of the bog surface between similar to 3700 and 1200 cat yr BP and the loss of sediments to either deflation or erosion. Spikes in pollen of broadleaf trees and shrubs, mainly before 2500 cat yr BP, may indicate warmer or wetter intervals. Remobilized old charcoal, along with peaks in Poaceae, Cyathea, and Lophosoria, indicate a possible large tropical storm event around 2900 cat yr BP. Transported clasts of peat and soil in the core signal other high precipitation events. We found no clear evidence of prehistoric human activity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High elevation ecosystems are likely more sensitive to climate change. But, due to paucity of instrumental records, such effects are poorly studied, particularly in mountains outside Europe and North America. Here, we quantified water body area fluctuations for the last 32years in 15 lakes spread over an area of 14.3 million ha in the Argentine Puna, through the classification of Landsat images; and we quantified peatlands NDVI (a proxy of vegetation productivity) from MODIS images. We evaluated the pairwise similarity between lakes interannual fluctuations and their relationship with climate models (TRMM 3B43 v7; CRU TS 4.10) and potential controls (ENSO index); and the correlations between water body area and the NDVI variation of its associated peatlands. Lakes were grouped in two clusters defined by their synchronic water body area variability and these clusters define two main geographic zones: NE and SW. Consistent with previous observations of an overall aridization trend, water body area generally decreased but showed large variability among lakes. Peatlands productivity was more correlated with lake variability than with modeled precipitation, and lake water body area was weakly related to indices of ENSO, providing an additional tool to relate local climate with continental and global climate models. The analysis shows that lake behavior is highly variable spatially and temporally, and that satellite-based monitoring is a valuable tool for assessing ecological conditions of wetlands in the region, characterized by the lack of climatic instrumental records; and to explore the vulnerability of wetlands to climate change.

AB Fire is a critical component of many ecosystems and, as predicted by various climate models, fire activity may increase significantly in the following years due to climate change. Therefore, knowledge about the past fire activity of various ecosysterns is highly important for future nature conservation purposes. We present results of high-resolution investigation of fire activity and hydrological changes in northern Poland. We analyzed microscopic charcoal from three Sphagnum-dominated peatlands located on the south of Baltic, on the oceanic continental (west east) climatic gradient, and reconstructed the history of fire in the last 5700 years. We hypothesize that air circulation patterns are highly important for local fire activity, and that fire activity is more intensive in peatlands influenced by continental air masses. We have found out that forest fires have been occurring regularly since the past millennia and were linked to climatic conditions. We show that fire activity (related to climate and fuel availability) was significantly higher in sites dominated by continental climate (northeastern Poland) than in the site located under oceanic conditions (northwestern Poland) microscopic charcoal influx was 133 times higher in the eastern study site of the gradient, compared to the western study site. Recorded fire activity patterns were different between the sites in a long timescale. Moreover, most of the recorded charcoal peaks occurred during high water tables. Rising human pressure has caused droughts and water table instability, and substantial increase in fire activity in the last 400 years. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increased prevalence of smaller-bodied species under warmer conditions (community downsizing) is hypothesized as an ecologically critical consequence of climate change, leading to changes in trophic transfer efficiency, and rates of nutrient and energy flux within ecosystems. This study used 100 intact peat-soil mescosms to measure changes in belowground biodiversity under three manipulated climate variables: elevated temperature, elevated CO2, and altered water table. Changes in species richness, abundance, community composition and body size spectra were used to determine whether climate change factors led to community downsizing, and elucidate any underlying mechanisms. Warming was the primary driver of compositional shifts in belowground fauna communities with the strongest effect among the smaller-bodied, non-sexually reproducing species. Increases in abundance driven by enhanced reproduction in small-bodied species rather than an increased extinction-rate among large-bodied predators was the basis of the observed downsizing. The overall consequences of warming-induced changes in belowground systems on ecosystem function are still unclear. However, as body size is intricately linked to metabolism, observed community downsizing suggests reductions in food web trophic transfer efficiency with consequences for nutrient and energy dynamics in belowground systems.

AB [1] Global wetlands are, at estimate ranging 115-237 Tg CH4/yr, the largest single atmospheric source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). We present a dataset on CH4 flux rates totaling 12 measurement years at sites from Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia and Siberia. We find that temperature and microbial substrate availability (expressed as the organic acid concentration in peat water) combined explain almost 100% of the variations in mean annual CH4 emissions. The temperature sensitivity of the CH4 emissions shown suggests a feedback mechanism on climate change that could validate incorporation in further developments of global circulation models.

AB 1. Vascular plant growth forms in northern peatlands differ in their strategies to cope with the harsh climate, low nutrient availability and progressively increasing height of the Sphagnum carpet in which they grow. Climate change may therefore affect growth forms differentially, both directly and through changes in the length growth of Sphagnum mosses. However, the role of mosses as modifiers of climate-change effects on vascular plants has been largely overlooked so far. We investigated the direct and Sphagnum-mediated effects of experimental changes in summer, winter and spring climate on four species of contrasting growth forms (evergreen and deciduous shrubs, graminoid, forb) in a subarctic bog, by studying their biomass and nitrogen losses through leaf litter, and the length growth of the two shrubs.
   2. Direct and indirect effects of summer warming differed among the growth forms. Enhanced Sphagnum overgrowth of leaves due to summer warming initially stimulated leaf litter losses of the evergreen shrub Empetrum nigrum. However, changes in its shoot morphology, related to an apparent small increase in its length growth, prevented further effects. A stronger increase in stem growth of the deciduous shrub Betula nana in response to summer warming directly reduced its leaf litter mass, N concentration and N losses. The changed allocation prevented indirect, Sphagnum-mediated effects on its leaf and N dynamics through overgrowth of buds. In contrast, leaf litter mass, N concentrations or N losses of the forb Rubus chamaemorus and the graminoid Calamagrostis lapponica were not affected by summer warming or enhanced Sphagnum growth.
   3. Increases in winter snow cover, with or without spring warming, did not affect shrub growth, nor the total shoot leaf litter mass or N dynamics of any of the growth forms.
   4. Altogether, summer warming is likely to enhance Sphagnum overgrowth of small shrubs with a limited growth response such as Empetrum. Moreover, increased vertical growth may allow Sphagnum to keep pace with inclined growing, responsive shrubs such as Betula. This might prevent net longer-term positive effects of summer warming on the vascular plant canopy height. However, leaf litter and N losses are more likely to be affected by direct warming effects on shoot morphology and allocation than by Sphagnum growth. The different responses of the growth forms to summer warming suggest that both direct and Sphagnum-mediated climate effects have the potential to change the vascular plant community and N dynamics in peatlands.

AB Global warming is likely to influence the soil microorganisms and enzyme activity and alter the carbon and nitrogen balance of peatland ecosystems. To investigate the difference in sensitivities of carbon and nitrogen cycling microorganisms and enzyme activity to warming, we conducted three-year warming experiments in a boreal peatland. Our findings demonstrated that both mcrA and nirS gene abundance in shallow soil and deep soil exhibited insensitivity to warming, while shallow soil archaea 16S rRNA gene and amoA gene abundance in both shallow soil and deep soil increased under warming. Soil pmoA gene abundance of both layers, bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance in shallow soil, and nirK gene abundance in deep soil decreased due to warming. The decreases of these gene abundances would be a result of losing labile substrates because of the competitive interactions between aboveground plants and underground soil microorganisms. Experimental warming inhibited -glucosidase activity in two soil layers and invertase activity in deep soil, while it stimulated acid phosphatase activity in shallow soil. Both temperature and labile substrates regulate the responses of soil microbial abundances and enzyme activities to warming and affect the coupling relationships of carbon and nitrogen. This study provides a potential microbial mechanism controlling carbon and nitrogen cycling in peatland under climate warming.

AB Rapid changes in atmospheric methane (CH4), temperature and precipitation are documented by Greenland ice core data both for glacial times (the so called Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events) as well as for a cooling event in the early Holocene (the 8.2 kyr event). The onsets of D-O warm events are paralleled by abrupt increases in CH4 by up to 250 ppb in a few decades. Vice versa, the 8.2 kyr event is accompanied by an intermittent decrease in CH4 of about 80 ppb over 150 yr. The abrupt CH4 changes are thought to mainly originate from source emission variations in tropical and boreal wet ecosystems, but complex process oriented bottom-up model estimates of the changes in these ecosystems during rapid climate changes are still missing. Here we present simulations of CH4 emissions from northern peatlands with the LPJ-Bern dynamic global vegetation model. The model represents CH4 production and oxidation in soils and transport by ebullition, through plant aerenchyma, and by diffusion. Parameters are tuned to represent site emission data as well as inversion-based estimates of northern wetland emissions. The model is forced with climate input data from freshwater hosing experiments using the NCAR CSM1.4 climate model to simulate an abrupt cooling event. A concentration reduction of similar to 10 ppb is simulated per degree K change of mean northern hemispheric surface temperature in peatlands. Peatland emissions are equally sensitive to both changes in temperature and in precipitation. If simulated changes are taken as an analogy to the 8.2 kyr event, boreal peatland emissions alone could only explain 23% of the 80 ppb decline in atmospheric methane concentration. This points to a significant contribution to source changes from low latitude and tropical wetlands to this event.

AB We analyzed the fossil insect fauna of a palsa peatland located 10 km south and east of the treeline in subarctic Quebec (57 degrees 45'N, 76 degrees 15'W) to detect any changes in the species composition during the Holocene epoch and to infer past environmental conditions in the study area. A minimum of 802 beetle individuals were recovered from a 2-m pear section, representing 51 taxa (18 identified to the species level) and 8 families. Trechus crassiscapus, Eucnecosum brunnescens, and Olophrum rotundicolle were the most common species found in the peat. The insect assemblage was quite stable through the study interval (5850-1950 BP). The formation of the palsa (where the peat section was excavated) occurred probably after 1950 BP, raising the soil surface above water level and preventing additional peat accumulation. The proportion of boreal forest species in the faunal assemblage is high (88%). The only arctic (tundra) species found were Amara alpina and Pterostichus arcticola. Many species were out of their modern distribution range, but since collection localities are scarce in subarctic Quebec, the modern range of these species may extend to the study site. A mutual climatic range analysis, employing beetles identified to the species level, showed that the mean July temperature of the study area between 5850 and 1950 BP was possibly 2.8-5.5 degrees C higher than during the 20th century. This assertion is supported by other paleoecological data (pollen and charcoal remains) suggesting a cooling trend in the study area after 2000 BP. However, since the last 2000 years are missing from the sampled peat section, it was not possible to quantify the impact of the cooling trend on the beetle fauna.

AB [1] Large spatial and temporal variations in stream total organic carbon (TOC) concentration and export occurred during an 11-year observation period (1993-2003) in a boreal headwater catchment. TOC flux and concentration patterns from mire- and forest-dominated subcatchments differed ( mean annual flux 8.2 g m(-2)a(-1) versus 5.8 g m(-2) a(-1)). Temporal variations in stream TOC concentrations in both landscape types were primarily driven by variations in streamflow, with the mire stream generally diluting by half with increased runoff during spring flood and TOC from the forested landscape increasing during runoff peaks irrespective of season. Average TOC concentration in the mire stream in the snow-free season increased with increased seasonal precipitation from around 20 to 40 mg L(-1) but then dropped to around 35 mg L(-1) during very wet years. Average snow-free season TOC concentration at the forested site remained stable when summer precipitation was below average but then increased from 10 to around 25 mg L(-1) during exceptionally wet years. For both the forested subcatchment and the whole catchment, TOC concentrations increased during the warm summer months during wet years, but no such increase occurred during dry years. Interannual variations in TOC flux were primarily driven by variations during the snow-free period. Wet years decreased the relative TOC export from the mire and favored the relative export of TOC from areas dominated by forest, an observation that also held true on a larger scale when similar landscape types were considered. Predicted climate change in rainfall and temperature patterns will affect the amount and character of TOC exported downstream from boreal landscapes with a mix of forest and mire.

AB Waterborne carbon (C) export from terrestrial ecosystems is a potentially important flux for the net catchment C balance and links the biogeochemical C cycling of terrestrial ecosystems to their downstream aquatic ecosystems. We have monitored hydrology and stream chemistry over 3 years in ten nested catchments (0.6-15.1km(2)) with variable peatland cover (0%-22%) and groundwater influence in subarctic Sweden. Total waterborne C export, including dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), ranged between 2.8 and 7.3gm(-2)year(-1), representing similar to 10%-30% of catchment net ecosystem exchange of CO2. Several characteristics of catchment waterborne C export were affected by interacting effects of peatland cover and groundwater influence, including magnitude and timing, partitioning into DOC, POC, and DIC and chemical composition of the exported DOC. Waterborne C export was greater during the wetter years, equivalent to an average change in export of similar to 2gm(-2)year(-1) per 100mm of precipitation. Wetter years led to a greater relative increase in DIC export than DOC export due to an inferred relative shift in dominance from shallow organic flow pathways to groundwater sources. Indices of DOC composition (SUVA(254) and a(250)/a(365)) indicated that DOC aromaticity and average molecular weight increased with catchment peatland cover and decreased with increased groundwater influence. Our results provide examples on how waterborne C export and DOC composition might be affected by climate change. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Boreal peatlands are major catchment sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrients and thus strongly regulate the landscape carbon balance, aquatic food webs, and downstream water quality. Climate change is likely to influence catchment solute yield directly through climatic controls on run-off generation, but also indirectly through altered disturbance regimes. In this study we monitored water chemistry from early spring until fall at the outlets of a 321 km(2) catchment that burned 3 years prior to the study and a 134 km(2) undisturbed catchment. Both catchments were located in the discontinuous permafrost zone of boreal western Canada and had similar to 60% peatland cover. The two catchments had strong similarities in the timing of DOC and nutrient yields, but a few differences were consistent with anticipated effects of wildfire based on peatland porewater analysis. The 4-week spring period, particularly the rising limb of the spring freshet, was crucial for accurate characterization of the seasonal solute yield from both catchments. The spring period was responsible for similar to 65% of the seasonal DOC and nitrogen and for similar to 85% of the phosphorous yield. The rising limb of the spring freshet was associated with high phosphorous concentrations and DOC of distinctly high aromaticity and molecular weight. Shifts in stream DOC concentrations and aromaticity outside the early spring period were consistent with shifts in relative streamflow con-tribution from precipitation-like water in the spring to mineral soil groundwater in the summer, with consistent relative contributions from organic soil porewater. Radiocarbon content (C-14) of DOC at the outlets was modern throughout May to September (fraction modern carbon, fM: 0.99-1.05) but likely reflected a mix of aged DOC, e.g. porewater DOC from permafrost (fM: 0.65-0.85) and non-permafrost peatlands (fM: 0.95-1.00), with modern bomb-influenced DOC, e.g. DOC leached from forest litter (fM: 1.05-1.10). The burned catchment had significantly increased total phosphorous (TP) yield and also had greater DOC yield during summer which was characterized by a greater contribution from aged DOC. Overall, however, our results suggest that DOC composition and yield from peatland-rich catchments in the discontinuous permafrost region likely is more sensitive to climate change through impacts on run-off generation rather than through altered fire regimes.

AB Accurate estimation of CH4 fluxes in alpine peatland of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau under extreme drought is vital for understanding the global carbon cycle and predicting future climate change. However, studies on the impacts of extreme drought on peatland CH4 fluxes are limited. To study the effects of extreme drought on CH4 fluxes of the Zoige alpine peatland ecosystem, the CH4 fluxes during both extreme drought treatment (D) and control treatment (CK) were monitored using a static enclosed chamber in a control platform of extreme drought. The results showed that extreme drought significantly decreased CH4 fluxes in the Zoige alpine peatland by 31.54% (P < 0 :05). Extreme drought significantly reduced the soil water content (SWC) (P < 0 :05), but had no significant effect on soil temperature (Ts). Under extreme drought and control treatments, there was a significant negative correlation between CH4 fluxes and environmental factors (Ts and SWC), except Ts, at a depth of 5cm (P < 0 :05). Extreme drought reduced the correlation between CH4 fluxes and environmental factors and significantly weakened the sensitivity of CH4 fluxes to SWC (P < 0:01). Moreover, it was found that the correlation between subsoil (20 cm) environmental factors and CH4 fluxes was higher than with the topsoil (5, 10 cm) environmental factors under the control and extreme drought treatments. These results provide a better understanding of the extreme drought effects on CH4 fluxes of alpine peatland, and their hydrothermal impact factors, which provides a reliable reference for peatland protection and management.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions from the northern high-latitude region represent potentially significant biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. We compiled a database of growing-season CH4 emissions from terrestrial ecosystems located across permafrost zones, including 303 sites described in 65 studies. Data on environmental and physical variables, including permafrost conditions, were used to assess controls on CH4 emissions. Water table position, soil temperature, and vegetation composition strongly influenced emissions and had interacting effects. Sites with a dense sedge cover had higher emissions than other sites at comparable water table positions, and this was an effect that was more pronounced at low soil temperatures. Sensitivity analysis suggested that CH4 emissions from ecosystems where the water table on average is at or above the soil surface (wet tundra, fen underlain by permafrost, and littoral ecosystems) are more sensitive to variability in soil temperature than drier ecosystems (palsa dry tundra, bog, and fen), whereas the latter ecosystems conversely are relatively more sensitive to changes of the water table position. Sites with near-surface permafrost had lower CH4 fluxes than sites without permafrost at comparable water table positions, a difference that was explained by lower soil temperatures. Neither the active layer depth nor the organic soil layer depth was related to CH4 emissions. Permafrost thaw in lowland regions is often associated with increased soil moisture, higher soil temperatures, and increased sedge cover. In our database, lowland thermokarst sites generally had higher emissions than adjacent sites with intact permafrost, but emissions from thermokarst sites were not statistically higher than emissions from permafrost-free sites with comparable environmental conditions. Overall, these results suggest that future changes to terrestrial high-latitude CH4 emissions will be more proximately related to changes in moisture, soil temperature, and vegetation composition than to increased availability of organic matter following permafrost thaw.

AB Accurate simulation of soil thermal dynamics is essential for realistic prediction of soil biogeochemical responses to climate change. To facilitate ecological forecasting at the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental change site, we incorporated a soil temperature module into a Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model by accounting for surface energy budget, snow dynamics, and heat transfer among soil layers and during freeze-thaw events. We conditioned TECO with detailed soil temperature and snow depth observations through data assimilation before the model was used for forecasting. The constrained model reproduced variations in observed temperature from different soil layers, the magnitude of snow depth, the timing of snowfall and snowmelt, and the range of frozen depth. The conditioned TECO forecasted probabilistic distributions of soil temperature dynamics in six soil layers, snow, and frozen depths under temperature treatments of +0.0, +2.25, +4.5, +6.75, and +9.0 degrees C. Air warming caused stronger elevation in soil temperature during summer than winter due to winter snow and ice. And soil temperature increased more in shallow soil layers in summer in response to air warming. Whole ecosystem warming (peat + air warmings) generally reduced snow and frozen depths. The accuracy of forecasted snow and frozen depths relied on the precision of weather forcing. Uncertainty is smaller for forecasting soil temperature but large for snow and frozen depths. Timely and effective soil thermal forecast, constrained through data assimilation that combines process-based understanding and detailed observations, provides boundary conditions for better predictions of future biogeochemical cycles.

AB Holocene climatic variability and human impact on vegetation are reconstructed from a region in central European Russia, which lies at an important ecotone between broadleaf forest and steppe. For the first time in this region we adopt a multi-proxy approach that combines analysis of local mire conditions from plant macrofossil and testate amoeba analyses with pollen-based quantitative climate reconstruction. The proxies indicate a long-term warming trend from 9700 to 7500 cal yr BP, interrupted by a series of short-term cold events. From 7500 to 5000 cal yr BP the results imply a relatively stable climate, warmer and drier than present, spanning the Holocene Thermal Maximum. Since 5000 cal yr BP the data suggest a change to cooler climate, but with centennial-scale variability. This shift at around 5000 cal yr BP is supported by extensive evidence from other sites. In the early Holocene, the region was occupied mainly by pine and birch forests. Broad-leafed forests of oak, lime and elm expanded after 7800 cal yr BP and remained dominant until the last few centuries. During the historical period, vegetation changes have been driven mainly by human activities. (C) 2015 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Saline wetlands represent potential natural analogs for reclaimed wetlands in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR). Thus, an understanding of the drivers of salinity changes in natural wetlands can provide insight into how reconstructed peatlands in the AOSR may evolve given that they are constructed with saline oil sands reclamation materials. Here, we investigate the nature of salinity changes from the analysis of sediment cores at three ponds situated within a saline peat-forming wetland near Fort McMurray (Alberta). Past changes in salinity were reconstructed using weighted-averaging transfer functions based on diatoms and an environmental dataset from 32 saline boreal ponds. Results reveal complex "precipitation-surface water-groundwater" interactions associated with differences in the hydrologic functioning of the studied ponds, and their connectivity with shallow groundwater aquifers and adjacent wetlands. Relationships between cumulative departure from mean precipitation and DI-salinity suggest that precipitation may control salinity both directly and indirectly. In ponds recharged predominantly by meteoric water, precipitation may govern salinity directly by dilution of salt content in water, so that rises in precipitation result in a salinity decline. In ponds situated within a saline groundwater discharge zone, salinity may be influenced by precipitation indirectly through recharge of the saline aquifer, so increases in precipitation lead to rises in salinity. Our study suggests that complex salinity response to precipitation change, coupled with notable range of salinity fluctuation within natural saline fens should be considered while designing saline constructed wetlands and predicting their potential resilience under climate change.

AB The aquatic pathway is increasingly being recognized as an important component of catchment carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, particularly in peatland systems due to their large carbon store and strong hydrological connectivity. In this study, we present a complete 5-year data set of all aquatic carbon and GHG species from an ombrotrophic Scottish peatland. Measured species include particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, CH4 and N2O. We show that short-term variability in concentrations exists across all species and this is strongly linked to discharge. Seasonal cyclicity was only evident in DOC, CO2 and CH4 concentration; however, temperature correlated with monthly means in all species except DIC. Although the temperature correlation with monthly DOC and POC concentrations appeared to be related to biological productivity in the terrestrial system, we suggest the temperature correlation with CO2 and CH4 was primarily due to in-stream temperature-dependent solubility. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon concentration was strongly correlated with catchment gross primary productivity (GPP) indicating a strong potential terrestrial aquatic linkage. DOC represented the largest aquatic carbon flux term (19.3 +/- 4.59g Cm-2yr-1), followed by CO2 evasion (10.0g Cm-2yr-1). Despite an estimated contribution to the total aquatic carbon flux of between 8 and 48%, evasion estimates had the greatest uncertainty. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon export was low in comparison with variability in terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchange, and could be explained primarily by temperature and precipitation. Our results therefore suggest that climatic change is likely to have a significant impact on annual carbon losses through the aquatic pathway, and as such, aquatic exports are fundamental to the understanding of whole catchment responses to climate change.

AB The headwater streams originating in the Australian Alps are the highest water yielding landscape in South-Eastern Australia and are projected to be impacted by climate change through longer dry periods and more episodic rainfall. In this work we studied the major ion and DOC responses of three alpine peat lands (and the broader catchment containing these systems) to a high intensity (summer) storm event. Despite the high volume of rainfall, major ions in stream waters remained strongly chemostatic throughout the event. This was particularly the case for Ca2+ and Mg2+, as well as the alkalinity by association, and suggests that chemical regulation of these particular cations occurs through rapid equilibration processes. DOC concentrations increased during the storm pulse, leading to a shift in alkalinity partitioning from bicarbonate to organic anions and a decrease in pH, mediated by the CO2 saturation levels in the stream water. Our results suggest that alkalinity generation (Ca2+ and Mg2+ acquisition) and partitioning (DOC export) are decoupled processes that may respond differently to repeat storm events depending on the capacity of these systems to provide these constituents. Under extreme case scenarios depletion of DOC (at constant alkalinity) would lead to a smaller pH dip during a storm pulse, while depletion of alkalinity would lead to a larger pH dip, with buffering controlled by free acid. We have not identified the mechanism for the chemostasis of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (and therefore alkalinity) in this work, but this will be critical to understanding the capacity of these peatlands to respond to repeat and more intense storm events.

AB Sphagnum mosses are the keystone species of peatland ecosystems. With rapid rates of climate change occurring in high latitudes, vast reservoirs of carbon accumulated over millennia in peatland ecosystems are potentially vulnerable to rising temperature and changing precipitation. We investigate the seasonal drivers of Sphagnum gross primary production (GPP)the entry point of carbon into wetland ecosystems. Continuous flux measurements and flux partitioning show a seasonal cycle of Sphagnum GPP that peaked in the late summer, well after the peak in photosynthetically active radiation. Wavelet analysis showed that water table height was the key driver of weekly variation in Sphagnum GPP in the early summer and that temperature was the primary driver of GPP in the late summer and autumn. Flux partitioning and a process-based model of Sphagnum photosynthesis demonstrated the likelihood of seasonally dynamic maximum rates of photosynthesis and a logistic relationship between the water table and photosynthesizing tissue area when the water table was at the Sphagnum surface. The model also suggested that variability in internal resistance to CO2 transport, a function of Sphagnum water content, had minimal effect on GPP. To accurately model Sphagnum GPP, we recommend the following: (1) understanding seasonal photosynthetic trait variation and its triggers in Sphagnum; (2) characterizing the interaction of Sphagnum photosynthesizing tissue area with water table height; (3) modeling Sphagnum as a soil layer for consistent simulation of water dynamics; and (4) measurement of Sphagnum canopy properties: extinction coefficient (k), clumping (), and maximum stem area index (SAI).

AB The generally-accepted paradigm of wetland response to dimate change is that water table drawdown and higher temperatures will cause wetlands to switch from a sink to a source of atmospheric carbon. However, it is hard to find a multi-year, ecosystem scale dataset representative of an undisturbed wetland that clearly demonstrates this paradigm on an annual total basis. Here we provide strong empirical confirmation of the above scenario based on six years of continuous eddy-covariance CO2 and CH4 flux measurements in Biebrza Valley, north-eastern Poland. In wet years the mire was a significant sink of atmospheric carbon (down to -270 +/- 70 gC-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) against +21.8 +/- 3.4 gC-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2013) whereas in dry years it constituted a sub- stantial carbon source (releasing up to +130 +/- 70 gC-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) and +2.6 +/- 1.4 gC-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015). Our findings demonstrate that the scenario of positive feedback between wetland carbon release and the present climate change trajectory is realistic and support the need of natural wetland preservation or rewetting. Our findings also indicate that conclusions drawn regarding a wetland's response to changing climate can depend strongly on the chosen period of analysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing DOC concentrations in surface waters have been observed across parts of Europe and North America over the past few decades Most proposed explanations for these widespread trends invoke climate change or reductions in sulphate deposition However these factors do not seem apposite to explain either the fine-scale (within kilometres) or regional-scale spatial variation in DOC concentrations observed across the UK
   We have reconstructed DOC concentrations and land use for one North Pennine and five South Pennine catchments (UK) located in three discrete areas over the last four decades Rainfall temperature and sulphate deposition data where available were also collated and the potential influence of these factors on surface water DOC concentrations was assessed
   Four of the six catchments examined showed highly significant (p<0 001) increases (53-92%) in humic coloured DOC (hDOC) concentrations in drainage waters over the period 1990-2005 Changes in temperature and sulphate deposition may explain 20-30% of this trend in these four catchments However the rapid expansion of new moorland burn on blanket peat can explain a far greater degree (>80%) of the change in hDOC Far smaller increases in hDOC (10-18%) were identified for the two remaining catchments These two sites experienced similar changes in sulphur deposition and temperature to those that had seen largest increases in DOC but contained little or no moorland burn management on blanket peat
   This study shows that regional-scale factors undoubtedly underlie some of the recent observed increases in drainage humic coloured DOC However changes in land management in this case the extensive use of fire management on blanket peat are a far more important driver of increased hDOC release from upland catchments in some parts of the UK It suggests that the recent rapid increase in the use of burning on blanket peat moorland has implications for ecosystem services and carbon budgets (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved

AB Background and Aims The ecosystem engineers Sphagnum (peat mosses) are responsible for sequestering a large proportion of carbon in northern peatlands. Species may respond differently to hydrological changes, and water level changes may lead to vegetation shifts in peatlands, causing them to revert from sinks to sources of carbon. We aimed to compare species-specific responses to water level drawdown within Sphagnum, and investigate which traits affect water economy in this genus.
   Methods In a mesocosm experiment, we investigated how water level drawdown affected water content (WC) in the photosynthetically active apex of the moss and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (i.e. F-v/F-m) of 13 Sphagnum species. Structural traits were measured, and eight anatomical traits were quantified from scanning electron microscopy micrographs.
   Key Results Mixed-effects models indicated that at high water level, large leaves were the most influential predictor of high WC, and at low water level WC was higher in species growing drier in the field, with larger hyaline cell pore sizes and total pore areas associated with higher WC. Higher stem and peat bulk density increased WC, while capitulum mass per area and numerical shoot density did not. We observed a clear positive relationship between F-v/F-m and WC in wet-growing species.
   Conclusions While we found that most hummock species had a relatively high water loss resistance, we propose that some species are able to maintain a high WC at drawdown by storing large amounts of water at a high water level. Our result showing that leaf traits are important warrants further research using advanced morphometric methods. As climate change may lead to more frequent droughts and thereby water level drawdowns in peatlands, a mechanistic understanding of species-specific traits and responses is crucial for predicting future changes in these systems.

AB Climate change induced drying and flooding may alter the redox conditions of organic matter decomposition in peat soils. The seasonal and intermittent changes in pore water solutes (NO3-, Fe2+, SO42-, H2S, acetate) and dissolved soil gases (CO2, O-2, CH4, H-2) under natural water table fluctuations were compared to the response under a reinforced drying and flooding in fen peats. Oxygen penetration during dryings led to CO2 and CH4 degassing and to a regeneration of dissolved electron acceptors (NO3-, Fe3+ and SO42-). Drying intensity controlled the extent of the electron acceptor regeneration. Iron was rapidly reduced and sulfate pools similar to 1 mM depleted upon rewetting and CH4 did not substantially accumulate until sulfate levels declined to similar to 100 mu mol L-1. The post-rewetting recovery of soil methane concentrations to levels similar to 80 mu mol L-1 needed 40-50 days after natural drought. This recovery was prolonged after experimentally reinforced drought. A greater regeneration of electron acceptors during drying was not related to prolonged methanogenesis suppression after rewetting. Peat compaction, solid phase content of reactive iron and total reduced inorganic sulfur and organic matter content controlled oxygen penetration, the regeneration of electron acceptors and the recovery of CH4 production, respectively. Methane production was maintained despite moderate water table decline of 20 cm in denser peats. Flooding led to accumulation of acetate and H-2, promoted CH4 production and strengthened the co-occurrence of iron and sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Mass balances during drying and flooding indicated that an important fraction of the electron flow must have been used for the generation and consumption of electron acceptors in the solid phase or other mechanisms. In contrast to flooding, dry-wet cycles negatively affect methane production on a seasonal scale, but this impact might strongly depend on drying intensity and on the peat matrix, of which structure and physical properties influence moisture content.

AB Thaw of frozen peat in discontinuous permafrost zone produces a significant number of thermokarst lakes, which are known to contribute to Green House Gases (GHG) emission in the atmosphere. In palsa peatland of western Siberia, the thermokarst lake formation includes soil subsidences, lichen submergence and peat abrasion, leading to lateral spreading of the lake border, often intensified by ground fires. Mesocosm experiments were conducted during 3 weeks on tWo thermokarst lake waters interacting in 30-L tanks with surface horizon of peat, the dominant ground vegetation (lichen Cladonia sp.) and the ash produced by lichen burning at 450 C. The obtained results allowed a better understanding of physico-chemical factors controlling the enrichment of thermokarst lake water in organic carbon and metals, and evaluating CO2 sequestration/emission potential. The changes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), major element and divalent metal concentration in response to peat and lichen biomass addition were less than a factor of 2 over full duration of the experiment. Iron (Fe) concentration in the lake water decreased by a factor of 2 to 3 after the addition of peat and lichen biomass. The concentration of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates decreased by ca. 30 to 50%, presumably due to their co-precipitation with Fe hydroxide. The dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in tank with lichen increased by a factor of 5.5 0.5, likely due to respiration of algal component in closed environment Strong enrichment of the lake water in DIC, P, K, Ca, Mg, Si, Al, Ti, Mn, Mo, Rb, As, Sb and U upon the ash addition persisted over full duration of experiments and was significant (p <0.0001) compared to peat and lichen biomass treatments. These elements may serve as indicators of ground fire impact on thermokarst lake water's chemistry. The overall effect of ash leaching on aquatic ecosystems after ground fire of frozen Siberian peatland is predicted to be much stronger than that currently recognized for non-permafrost regions.

AB A key question for the evolution of thermokarst wetlands and lakes in Arctic and sub-Arctic permafrost regions is how large-scale warming interacts with local landscape conditions in driving permafrost thaw and its spatial variability. To answer this question, which also relates to risks for ecology, society, and health, we perform systematic model simulations of various soil-permafrost cases combined with different surface-warming trends. Results show that both the prevalence and the thaw of permafrost depended strongly on local soil conditions and varied greatly with these for the same temperature conditions at the surface. Greater ice contents and depth extents, but also greater subsurface volumes thawing at depth under warming, are found for peat soils than other studied soil/rock formations. As such, more thaw-driven regime shifts in wetland/lake ecosystems, and associated releases of previously frozen carbon and pathogens, may be expected under the same surface warming for peatlands than other soil conditions. Such risks may also increase in fast permafrost thaw in mineral soils, with only small thaw-protection effects indicated in the present simulations for possible desertification enhancement of mineral soil covers.

AB Methane emissions from wetlands are highly variable, both spatially and temporally and at scales ranging from microtopographic to regional differences. To comprehend this variation fully and also to predict responses to climate change, an understanding of the intimate linkage between carbon cycling and methane emission in these systems is needed. The presence of vascular plants has been recognized recently as one of the key factors controlling the scale of methane fluxes because it affects processes coupled to transport, production and consumption of methane. A wide area of research has therefore opened up, calling for investigations into details of the impact of vascular plants on methane emissions.

AB Peat soils comprise a large part of the western and northern Netherlands. Drainage for agriculture has caused increased soil aeration which has stimulated decomposition and, hence, soil subsidence, currently amounting to 1-2 cm/yr. River water is supplied to these peat areas in summer to prevent drying out of the peat soils. Saltwater intrusion and evaporation make this surface water slightly brackish during drought periods. In addition, brackish seepage can surface more easily during such dry periods. We performed an incubation experiment in which the effects of salinization on aerobic decomposition and mineralization of shallow peat samples and anaerobic decomposition and mineralization of deep peat samples were studied. We considered four different types of peat samples: peat sampled in agricultural peat meadows and in nature reserves, originally formed under either eutrophic or oligotrophic conditions. The aerobic decomposition was approximately reduced by 50% after salinization, whereas the anaerobic decomposition rates remained unchanged. Remarkably, the response to salinization did not differ between the peat types and land uses. Ammonium concentrations increased while nitrate concentrations decreased after salinization, probably as a result of reduced nitrification. Especially in the oligotrophic peat, ammonium concentrations increased substantially. Phosphate concentrations increased, possibly caused by changes in desorption and adsorption processes due to higher ion concentrations. DOC concentrations decreased in the brackish samples due to precipitation. Furthermore, the eutrophic peat samples showed increasing sulfate concentrations, both in oxic and anoxic incubations, which was attributed to pyrite oxidation. Independently of salinization, nitrification rates were higher in the agricultural, fertilized, peat soils. In conclusion, while salinization might reduce subsidence rates, it will have adverse effects on water quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Asian summer monsoon is a very important climatic component affecting the land ecosystem on the eastern Asian continent. Here we assess microbe-derived lipid biomarker evidence from a well-dated peat core from Dajiuhu to reconstruct paleotemperature changes in central China through the last 13 ka. The branched fatty alcohol ratio BNA(15), which is defined as the relative contribution of branched C15 fatty alcohols over their straight-chain homolog, shows a positive correlation with air temperature (R= 0.83, n=11, p<0.001) in an altitude transect at Shennongjia Mountain, central China. This correspondence suggests that the microbial activities associated with branched fatty alcohol synthesis are sensitive to differences in temperature. The BNA(15) sequence in the Dajiuhu peat deposit shows a trend similar to the paleotemperature record derived from pollen results over the last 13 ka, further supporting that BNA(15) is a sensitive proxy of paleotemperature. Absolute temperatures estimated from BNA(15) values of modern surface peats are about 3-4 degrees C lower than the modern annual mean air temperature in the peatland, which may result from the influences of factors other than temperature or from the different microbial communities in the mountain soils used to calibrate the BNA(15) acidic peats. Fluctuations in the continuous 13 ka BNA(15)-derived record of relative temperature change from the Dajiuhu peat core imply that solar activity is the dominant cause for most cold events at multicentennial to submillennial timescales.

AB Palaeoecological studies (including analysis of pollen, macrofossils, geochemistry, and AMS radiocarbon dates) of four peat sections from one low-centred ice-wedge polygon in NE Yakutia (NE Siberia) allow the three-dimensional reconstruction of polygon development during the last ca 1250 years. After drainage of a lake, peat forming vegetation invaded rapidly. Comparison with palaeotemperature data shows that the initial formation of mature ridges coincided with a period of high summer temperatures around AD 1400. The ridges persisted and expanded during the subsequent colder ca 200 years. Partial collapse of various ridges at the end of the 18th century corresponded to a phase with low summer temperatures. During the warm, 20th century one collapsed ridge regenerated, whereas another persisted in its collapsed state. Ice-wedge polygons are, thus, complex and highly dynamic ecosystems, in which changes in temperature and precipitation may induce rapid ecological changes by the complex interplay of water, ice and vegetation. Our study indicates that global warming associated with a decrease in summer precipitation may initially result in enhanced polygon ridge formation. The combination of longer summers and increased winter precipitation, as predicted for high latitudes will, however, eventually result in larger meltwater input in the polygon mires, which may cause the (partial) collapse of polygon ridges and underlying ice-wedges.

AB This study provides a new understanding of cellulose oxygen (delta O-18(cel))isotopic variability in various plant macrofossils, particularly Sphagnum, derived from an similar to 9200 year succession of Holocene peat in Mer Bleue Bog, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The variation of delta O-18(cel) isotopic composition, commonly used as a proxy of paleotemperature and paleoprecipitation, was compared between (1) Sphagnum and other plant macrofossils down core and (2) Sphagnum species within and between samples.
   The most common Sphagnum species encountered was Sphagnum magellanicum von Bridel, 1798 with lesser amounts of Sphagnum capillifolium (Breutel) Steudel, 1824, Sphagnum fuscum Klinggraff, 1872 and Sphagnum angustifolium Jensen, 1896. There is a statistically significant offset in delta O-18(cel) isotopic values (mean offset: 1.6 parts per thousand, standard deviation = 3.2%, n = 19) obtained from Sphagnum in comparison with values obtained from other plant macrofossils, particularly rhizomes. The delta O-18(cel) isotopic offset (mean offset: 0.1 parts per thousand, standard deviation = 1.0 parts per thousand, n = 11) between Sphagnum specimens from the same core horizons, irrespective of the species analyzed, was statistically insignificant at > 95%.
   These results indicate that delta O-18(cel) isotopic analysis of bulk peat material with high percentage of rhizome and other vascular plants could result in erroneous paleoclimate reconstructions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Landscape-scale ecohydrological mapping is commonly restrained to one-dimensional ecohydrological transect studies or two-dimensional vegetation distributions lacking adequate spatial coverage of explanatory hydrological data. The objective of this paper is to construct a two-dimensional (semi-3D) landscape-scale ecohydrological map based on vegetation distribution maps and detailed spatial, multi-year, floodplain inundation water quality data. The dataset comes from the near-natural Biebrza floodplain mire in Poland encompassing 658 inundation water quality analyses over the period 2002-2012, covering 17 different vegetation communities of freshwater marshes and rich fens. The data represent the main hydrological gradients from valley edge to river encompassing groundwater seepage, local stagnant precipitation influences and river flooding and drainage. We used chi-squared Haberman residuals analysis to correlate communities to inundation water quality types, resembling river water and three different types of groundwater. Out of 17 communities, six showed a preference for river water, three showed a preference for clean groundwater, four for diluted groundwater and one for polluted groundwater. For three communities, no significant preference was found. Spatial patterns in vegetation and attributed water quality preference can be linked to three dominant hydrological processes at the landscape scale, i.e. discharge of clean and polluted groundwater near the valley edges, dilution of exfiltrated groundwater with local snowmelt and precipitation water and flooding with river water along the river. The ecohydrological relations are depicted in two-dimensional maps and a semi-3D diagram with typical cross sections. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Wildfires in Siberia are documented to have increased in frequency and severity over recent decades. However, in the absence of long-term records, it is unclear how far and why this trend deviates from centennial to millennial scale variability. Here we reconstruct past patterns of fire frequency and fire type, and explore how the fire-related traits of boreal species and plant functional types (PFTs) determine ecosystem responses to changing fire regimes. We use charcoal-based reconstructions of the fire regime in combination with a pollen-based assessment of vegetation composition in two boreal forest peat profiles from Plotnikovo Mire in western Siberia that span the last 2400 and 5000 years. We found moderate levels of biomass burning between 5000 and 4000 cal yr BP. Biomass burning and fire severity i.e., more biomass burning per fire episode, increased over the last 1500 cal yr BP associated with the dominance of fire invaders (Betula). Conversely, between 4000 and 1500 cal yr BP lower biomass burning, with perhaps fire types affecting mostly litter and understorey vegetation, coincided with the dominance of fire resisters (e.g., Pinus sylvestris, P. sibirica, Larix) intermixed with a considerable number of fire avoiders (e.g., Abies sibirica and Picea obovata). This long-term perspective shows that the current fire regime commenced 1500 years ago and deviates from the trends observed over the last 5000 years. This deviation is linked to a combination of climate conditions conducive to fire, the amount and composition of woody fuels, and land use changes. Although pines reacted more sensitively to increased fire severity, the fire avoider Picea obovata appears to be much more vulnerable to both frequent, severe fires than Abies sibirica. We anticipate that climatically driven changes in fire weather, with frequent warm and dry spells, and anthropogenic land use intensification will heighten fire severity and their impact, driving vegetation composition towards Betula species to the detriment of Picea obovata. This study also shows that charcoal morphotypes can provide useful information on fuel and fire type, and that, although all macro-charcoal size classes reliably indicate local-scale fires, the larger fraction (>300 -500 mu m) allows the identification of on-site fire episodes. We recommend multi-site palaeo-fire reconstructions in boreal peatlands to adequately reflect the influence of localised peat moisture content, and vegetation composition and structure variability on the small-scale heterogeneity of fire type and spread. This will ensure that trends in fire regime dynamics are representative and not limited to the local scale. We also propose future directions in fire research that can be tested using fossil records of fire, climate and vegetation ideally in an interdisciplinary approach. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is considerable interest in understanding how management may help species and populations cope with climate change (climate change adaptation). I used a population model describing the demography of a southern range-margin European Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria population vulnerable to climate change to assess the potential benefits associated with site-based adaptation management. Two forms of management were simulated: (1) counteracting management to reduce the severity of the negative climate change impacts, simulated by increasing tipulid (cranefly) abundance, and (2) compensatory management to increase populations through an alternative mechanism, simulated by manipulating nest and chick predation rates. A 1 degrees C rise was estimated to require a doubling of cranefly abundance, or a 35% increase in nest and chick survival rates, to maintain a stable population. For a 2 degrees C rise, a four-fold increase in craneflies or an 80% increase in survival rates would be required for population stability. A model based on likely realistic estimates of the magnitude of benefit associated with both adaptation management options showed that combined, they may significantly reduce the severity of population decline and risk of extinction associated with a relatively large increase in temperature of 5.8 degrees C above 1960-90 levels. Site-based adaptation management may therefore increase the resistance of Golden Plovers to some degree of future climate change. This model framework for informing climate change adaptation decisions should be developed for other species and habitats.

AB Belowground interactions between plants and microorganisms are involved in numerous ecosystems processes such as carbon and nutrient cycling. Understanding their responses to on-going climate warming is thus of paramount importance to better predict future ecosystem functioning. We hypothesized that climate warming alters the interactions between Sphagnum litter phenolics and the fungal root symbiosis of the Ericale plant Andromeda polifolia in a Jura mountain peatland (France). We initiate a climate warming treatment (+1 degrees C) in April 2008 in two microhabitats (lawns and hummocks). We measured polyphenolic contents, mycorrhizal and dark septate endophyte (DSE) root colonization, phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities in the A. polifolia rhizosphere from 2010 to 2012. We found that four years of warming modulated rhizospheric parameters (fungal root symbiosis and enzyme activities) of A. polifolia, but the response differed between microhabitats. Enzyme activities and fungal root colonization displayed different responses to warming according to the microhabitats. DSE root colonization increased and peroxidase activities decreased in warmed Hummocks while they remained stable in warmed lawns. We found a significant positive correlation between DSE root colonization and litter phenolics recovered in both microhabitats but only under in ambient conditions. On the contrary, significant negative correlation was observed between mycorrhizae and litter phenolics recovered in warmed plots while no relationship was found in control plots. Our work thus provides evidences that interplay between phenolics from Sphagnum litter and fungal symbiosis of an Ericale species in peatlands was affected by climate warming. It highlights different plant biological responses to climate warming according to peatland microhabitats and confirm that belowground activities are crucial to understand the response of peatlands to climate change.

AB Plants in wild and agricultural settings are being affected by the warmer temperatures associated with climate change. Here we examine the degree to which the iconic New England cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon, is exhibiting signs of altered flowering phenology. Using contemporary records from commercial cranberry bogs in southeastern Massachusetts in the United States, we found that cranberry plants are responsive to temperature. Flowering is approximately 2 days earlier for each 1 A degrees C increase in May temperature. We also investigated the relationship between cranberry flowering and flight dates of the bog copper, Lycaena epixanthe-a butterfly dependent upon cranberry plants in its larval stage. Cranberry flowering and bog copper emergence were found to be changing disproportionately over time, suggesting a potential ecological mismatch. The pattern of advanced cranberry flowering over time coupled with increased temperature has implications not only for the relationship between cranberry plants and their insect associates but also for agricultural crops in general and for the commercial cranberry industry.

AB Northern latitude peatlands contain large reserves of soil carbon (C) due in part to climatic constraints on decomposition, including low temperatures and water inundated soils. Under future climate change scenarios these peatlands will experience warmer temperatures, extended growing seasons, and a potential draw down of the water table, all of which improve conditions for decomposition, as well as photosynthesis. Increased photosynthesis may feedback to increase decomposition of soil C through increased root exudates to belowground decomposer communities, primarily as low molecular weight carbon compounds (LMWCC). In this study, we examine the interactive effects of climate, a combination of three temperatures and two moisture regimes, and root exudates on microbial decomposer function, measured as CO2 respiration, biomass, and potential enzyme activity. We had four substrate treatments: two common LMWCC (glycine or glucose + citric acid), chitin to simulate fungal necromass, and DI as the control. Our results support our first hypothesis that increasing temperature will increase C respiration across substrate and moisture treatments. Our second hypothesis was that compared to control and chitin, soluble substrates (i.e., LMWCC) will enhance respiration across all climate treatments. This was only partially supported. As expected, the two LMWCC substrate additions increased C respiration above the two other substrate additions at current recorded growing season average (12 degrees C, low treatment) and high (20 degrees C, med treatment) temperature treatments. Surprisingly, when the system was pushed to a higher temperature extreme (28 degrees C, high treatment), the low moisture controls respired more C than the other substrate x climate treatments. Potential enzyme activity and demand for phosphorus appear to explain these trends as opposed to changes to microbial biomass. Our results indicate that under projected future high temperatures, the peatland microbial community allocates additional labile C resources to enzyme production to meet nutrient demands, and as such, dampens C lost through respiration.

AB Measurements of active layer thickness (ALT) are typically taken at the end of summer, a time synonymous with maximum thaw depth. By definition, the active layer is the layer above permafrost that freezes and thaws annually. This study, conducted in peatlands of subarctic Canada, in the zone of thawing discontinuous permafrost, demonstrates that the entire thickness of ground atop permafrost does not always refreeze over winter. In these instances, a talik exists between the permafrost and active layer, and ALT must therefore be measured by the depth of refreeze at the end of winter. As talik thickness increases at the expense of the underlying permafrost, ALT is shown to simultaneously decrease. This suggests that the active layer has a maximum thickness that is controlled by the amount of energy lost from the ground to the atmosphere during winter. The taliks documented in this study are relatively thin (<2m) and exist on forested peat plateaus. The presence of taliks greatly affects the stability of the underlying permafrost. Vertical permafrost thaw was found to be significantly greater in areas with taliks (0.07myear(-1)) than without (0.01myear(-1)). Furthermore, the spatial distribution of areas with taliks increased between 2011 and 2015 from 20% to 48%, a phenomenon likely caused by an anomalously large ground heat flux input in 2012. Rapid talik development and accelerated permafrost thaw indicates that permafrost loss may exhibit a nonlinear response to warming temperatures. Documentation of refreeze depths and talik development is needed across the circumpolar north.

AB Nitrogen (N) deposition has increased in the last few decades with implications for the functioning of Sphagnum mosses, the main peat forming genus in peatlands. However, there are few in situ measurements of the carbon balance, especially where the N additions have been realistically manipulated in the field, and none with respect to the effect of N form. The aim of this study was to look at the effects of experimental N additions as oxidized or reduced N, with and without phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), on CO2 fluxes from Sphagnum capillifolium hummocks in a long-term N addition experiment, Whim bog, in the Scottish Borders. In situ static chamber measurements were made during 2008 on 20 plots (control, and N treatments receiving 56 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) of either nitrate (NO3-) or ammonium (NH4) added, with and without PK) to assess N effects on CO2 exchange. Almost all the measured fluxes were negative, i.e. Sphagnum hummocks lost CO2 to the atmosphere, irrespective of the treatments applied. N treatment did not have a significant effect on ecosystem respiration (ER) or net ecosystem productivity (NEP) but adding PK with N increased gross photosynthesis (P-G) significantly, compared to the other treatments. Summed monthly averages of NEP for each treatment indicated that increasing N deposition increased CO2 loss from the system. The form of N affected the response: compared to the control, adding nitrate increased the CO2 loss more than ammonium, both with and without PK. Nitrogen (both forms). increased the ecosystem respiration fluxes at a certain temperature, adding PKwith N further enhanced the response. The positive (increasing) temperature response of ecosystem respiration with N suggests that in high N deposition areas the potential increase in ecosystem respiration, CO2 loss, will be exacerbated with climate change.

TI Phosphorus fertilization in a phosphorus-limited fen: effects of timing
SO APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Climate change; Nutrient limitation; P-availability; Rich fen; Summer
   drought
AB . Phosphorus availability in low P-soils is primarily controlled by soil processes that are subject to seasonal fluctuation. There is evidence that summer drought causing low fen-water levels induces temporal high P-availability. We investigate here whether and how fen vegetation responds to P-pulses at different times in the season. Plots were fertilized with equal P-doses at three different times in the season. Four conclusions can be drawn from the experiment: 1. The vegetation is able to increase P-uptake independent of the timing of fertilizer application; 2. Early-season fertilization stimulates growth and increases P-concentration in above-ground tissue while late-season fertilization does not stimulate growth but strongly increases above-ground tissue concentration; 3. Timing effects cause differential species responses: the response of Carex demissa, a stress-tolerant species, is truly independent of timing, while Juncus articulatus, a CSR-type species (sensu Grime) profits more from early-season fertilization; 4. Timing effects persist over several years. The differences between the experimental treatment and the events it aimed to simulate are discussed. We expect that higher frequencies of drought events, that may be induced by climate change, will cause a shift from nutrient-stress tolerant towards stress-tolerant-competitor fen species.

AB Warming greatly reshapes carbon cycle of peatlands where soil is water saturated with anaerobic condition prevailing all the year round. However, little is known about the response of anaerobic mineralization of peatlands carbon to global warming, especially when considering the difference of soil from above water table (AWT) and below water table (BWT). This study measured variations in soil carbon anaerobic mineralization as a function of warming and depth by sampling 100-cm soil columns in Zoige plateau. Warming enhanced carbon anaerobic mineralization significantly with different increments among the whole depths. The response of CO2-C and CH4-C to warming varied with depth: at surface soil, both CO2-C and CH4-C emission increased with higher increment; at deep soil, CO2-C emission increased with small increment and CH4-C emission decreased. Substrate availability influenced carbon anaerobic mineralization rate and pathway. Substantial resistant carbon at deep soil lowered CO2 increment and varied CH4 production pathway. The temperature sensitivity of peat carbon anaerobic mineralization varied with depth, suggesting the heterogeneous distribution of soil substrate among the whole depths. AWT soil was higher in temperature sensitivity than BWT soil for the substantial simple carbon and higher microbial/enzyme activity at AWT. BWT soil was a major contributor of the amount of carbon emission and the total increased carbon caused by warming. Further, for the management of peatlands, we should conduct advanced research by focusing more towards the soil of whole depth, especially on the temperature sensitivity of AWT soil and the contribution to total carbon emission of BWT soil.

AB Severe drying of soils can lead to cracking and thus the generation of new hydrological pathways. In soils that show hydrophobic behaviour upon drying, it is possible that such flowpaths survive beyond the period of the drought that caused the initial cracking. Change in flowpaths in peat following severe droughts has been proposed as an explanation for tong-term increases in DOC concentration leaving peat-covered catchments across the Northern Hemisphere With changes in climate making dry summers and summer drought more likely in the UK, this study aims to understand whether there have been long-term flowpath changes in a peat soil following a 1 in 33 year drought. The measure used by this study to analyse changes in the flowpaths present in peat soils is the probability of runoff initiation. The probability of runoff initiation represents a method for comparing the occurrence of runoff from the catchment in comparison to the precipitation inputs relative to the antecedent conditions of the catchment. The study examines 1674 rainfall events over a five year period before and after a severe drought and shows that the most important factor for controlling runoff initiation is the total amount of rainfall in any event and that the system is capacity rather than rate limited. The time of year is found to have a significant influence upon the probability of runoff initiation above and beyond the effect of water table depth and rainfall character. However, the study can find no persistent effect of severe drought beyond the period of drought itself, suggesting that, in terms of the factors investigated here, peat flowpaths are stable against changes in drought frequency and severity with climate change and cannot contribute to long-term changes in DOC runoff.

AB The temperature dependence of chemical reaction rates and microbial metabolism mean that temperature is a key factor regulating soil trace gas emissions and hydrochemistry. Here we evaluated a novel approach for studying the thermal response of soils, by examining the effects of temperature on gas emissions and hydrochemistry in (a) peat and (b) soil from a Sitka spruce plantation. A thermal gradient was applied along an aluminium bar, allowing soil to be incubated contemporaneously from 2 to 18 degrees C. The approach demonstrated clear differences in the biogeochemical responses of the two soil types to warming. The peat showed no significant emission of CH4 at temperatures below 6 degrees C, while above 6 degrees C, a marked increase in the rate of release was apparent up to 15 degrees C (Q(10) = 2.5) with emissions being similar between 15 and 18 degrees C. Conversely, CH4 emissions from the forest soil did not respond to warming. Nitrate availability in the peat decreased by 90% between 2 and 18 degrees C (P < 0.01), whereas concentrations in the forest soil did not respond. Sulphate availability in the peat decreased significantly with warming (60%, P < 0.01), while the forest soil showed the opposite response (a 30% increase, P < 0.01). Conventionally, thermal responses are studied by incubating individual soil samples at different temperatures, involving lengthy preparation and facilities to incubate samples at different temperatures simultaneously. Data collected on a given thermal response is usually limited and thus interpolated or extrapolated. The thermal gradient method overcomes these problems, is simple and flexible, and can be adapted for a wide range of sample types (not confined to soil). Such apparatus may prove useful in the optimization of management practices to mitigate the effects of climate change, as thermal responses will differ depending on land use and soil type.

AB We present the past 200 years palaeoecology of a peatland located in W Poland. This site is very important from the point of view of regional nature conservation. Plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, peat microtomography and radiocarbon dating were used in high-resolution to reconstruct the recent human impact on the peatland. In this study, we hypothesise that recent disturbance associated with peatland drainage and forest transformation has affected the development of the peatland and its trophic states. We sought to answer several questions. I) How pristine is the Rzecin peatland? II) Did the outbreak of Panolis flammea and the deforestation of 90% of the area of the Notec Forest affect the water table and the pH of the Rzecin peatland? III) Did the construction of the Rzecin Canal through the drainage of the peatland (in the 1880s and 1890s) strongly influence the changes in the ground water of the Rzecin peatland? Deforestation and the digging of the Rzecin drainage canal between AD 1880 and AD 1890 marked the beginning of major changes in the wetland ecosystem and caused habitat acidification. The next acidification event, connected with Sphagnum appearance, began ca AD 1990. Based on our quantitative reconstruction, the water table decreased during the years preceding P. flammea outbreak in AD 1923. Then, the water table increased after the outbreak correlated with the historical maps that show ephemeral lakes in the Notec Forest. The wetland examined by the current study was formerly perceived as highly natural, but its state is far from pristine, being very unstable during the last 200 years. Catastrophic events in the catchment change wetlands to a greater extent than we suppose, and their pristine state may not have existed for centuries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB Peatlands harbour more than one-third of terrestrial carbon leading to the argument that the bryophytes, as major components of peatland ecosystems, store more organic carbon in soils than any other collective plant taxa. Plants of the genus Sphagnum are important components of peatland ecosystems and are potentially vulnerable to changing climatic conditions. However, the response of Sphagnum to rising temperatures, elevated CO2 and shifts in local hydrology have yet to be fully characterized. In this review, we examine Sphagnum biology and ecology and explore the role of this group of keystone species and its associated microbiome in carbon and nitrogen cycling using literature review and model simulations. Several issues are highlighted including the consequences of a variable environment on plant-microbiome interactions, uncertainty associated with CO2 diffusion resistances and the relationship between fixed N and that partitioned to the photosynthetic apparatus. We note that the Sphagnum fallax genome is currently being sequenced and outline potential applications of population-level genomics and corresponding plant photosynthesis and microbial metabolic modelling techniques. We highlight Sphagnum as a model organism to explore ecosystem response to a changing climate and to define the role that Sphagnum can play at the intersection of physiology, genetics and functional genomics.
   The response of Sphagnum (moss) and its associated microbiome to changing climatic conditions have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we use literature review and a coupled plant - microbe biochemical model to formalize our understanding of the physiological process that ultimately drive these commensal interactions and ecosystem function. We conclude that as dominate members of carbon rich peatland ecosystems, Sphagnum and its microbiome must to studied and integrated across a continuum of genomic to ecological scales.

TI Moving beyond the direction of climate change to estimating its

AB Paleoclimate proxy studies of wetland sediment cores often document the direction if not the magnitude of climate change because transfer functions (pollen, diatoms, etc.) are unavailable or imprecise. A water-budget approach, presented here, circumvents the need for transfer functions in wetlands, using the Garden Basin cattail fen (GBC; Fish Lake Plateau, Utah, USA) as a model system. Prior studies of the GBC fen revealed both high and low-frequency oscillations between fen and pond states over the last 12.5 ka. Pollen indicated that pond-like conditions were accompanied by both greater monsoon and annual precipitation rates. However, the magnitude of these changes was not estimated.
   By synthesizing multiple approaches, including water-level monitoring, remote sensing (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI), and terrain analysis, limits were placed on precipitation changes required for pond versus fen ecosystems in Garden Basin. NDVI data show that water levels may be controlled by evapotranspiration (ET) instead of spring snowmelt. Water levels increase in mid-winter in response to the decline of photosynthesis of surrounding pi pinon-juniper (PJ) forest. In late summer through fall, ET drives the fen system into a moisture deficit and water declines below the ground surface.
   Quantitative limits on both annual and seasonal precipitation changes can be obtained through water budgets. For the GBC model, mean annual precipitation (similar to 350 mm/yr) must double (similar to 700 mm/yr) to sustain perennial standing water for 95% of years. Increases in late summer (monsoon) through fall (cyclonic) precipitation requires lesser rates (100-200 mm/yr) to satisfy PJ ET demands to maintain standing water. Thus, the habitats of many wetlands globally may be particularly sensitive to late-season precipitation where ET is the primary control on water levels. In summary, the GBC fen and its water budget are a template for quantifying the magnitude, rather than just the direction, of precipitation change in wetland systems through time.

AB Global change includes land-use change, elevated CO2 concentrations, increased temperature and increased rainfall variability. All four aspects by themselves and in combination will influence the role of roots in linking below- and above-ground ecosystem function via organic and inorganic resource flows. Root-mediated ecosystem functions which may be modified by global change include below-ground resource (water, nutrients) capture, creation and exploitation of spatial heterogeneity, buffering of temporal variations in above-ground factors, supply and storage of C and nutrients to the belowground ecosystem, mobilization of nutrients and C from stored soil reserves, and gas exchange between soil and atmosphere including the emission from soil of greenhouse gases.
   The theory of a functional equilibrium between root and shoot allocation is used to explore predicted responses to elevated CO2 in relation to water or nutrient supply as limiting root function. The theory predicts no change in root:shoot allocation where water uptake is the limiting root function, but substantial shifts where nutrient uptake is (or becomes) the limiting function. Root turnover will not likely be influenced by elevated CO2, but by changes in regularity of water supply. A number of possible mechanisms for root-mediated N mineralization is discussed in the light of climate change factors. Rhizovory (root consumption) may increase under global change as the balance between plant chemical defense and adapted root. consuming organisms may be modified during biome shifts in response to climate change. Root-mediated gas exchange allows oxygen to penetrate into soils and methane (CH4) to escape from wetland soils of tundra ecosystems as well as tropical rice production systems. The effect on net greenhouse gas emissions of biome shifts (fens replacing bogs) as well as of agricultural land management will depend partly on aerenchyma in roots.

AB The boreal landscape is a complex, spatio-temporally varying mosaic of forest and mire landscape elements that control surface water hydrology and chemistry. Here, we assess long-term water quality time series from three nested headwater streams draining upland forest (C2), peat/mire (C4) and mixed (C7) (forest and mire) catchments. Acid deposition in this region is low and is further declining. Temporal trends in weather and runoff (1981-2008), dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] (1993-2010) and other water quality parameters (1987-2011) were assessed. There was no significant annual trend in precipitation or runoff. However, runoff increased in March and declined in May. This suggested an earlier snowmelt regime in recent years. Significant monotonic increasing trends in air temperature and length of growing season suggested a decrease in snowfall and less spring runoff. Stream [DOC] was positively correlated with some trace metals (copper, iron and zinc) and negatively with several other chemical parameters (e. g. sulfate, conductivity, calcium). Both sulfate and conductivity showed declining trends, while a significant increase was observed in pH during winter and spring. Calcium and magnesium showed monotonic decreasing trends. The declining trajectories of stream base cation and sulfate concentrations during other times of the year were not accompanied by changes in pH and alkalinity. These results indicate subtle effects of recovery from acidification. Water temperature increased significantly both annually and in most months. A simultaneous monotonic increase in iron (Fe) and [DOC] in autumn suggests co-transport of Fe-DOC in the form of organometallic complexes. monotonic increase in UV absorbance in most months without co-occurring changes in DOC trend suggests a shift in DOC quality to a more humic-rich type. The observed increase in soil solution [DOC] and subtle trends in stream [DOC] suggest that climate rather than recovery from acidification is the dominant driver of DOC trends in the Svartberget catchment.

AB Partially decomposed plant and animal remains have been accumulating in organic soils (i.e. >40% C content) for millennia, making them the largest terrestrial carbon store. There is growing concern that, in a warming world, soil biotic processing will accelerate and release greenhouse gases that further exacerbate climate change. However, the magnitude of this response remains uncertain as the constraints are abiotic, biotic and interactive. Here, we examined the influence of resource quality and biological activity on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration under different soil moisture regimes. Organic soils were sampled from 13 boreal and peatland ecosystems located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Finland and Sweden, representing a natural resource quality range of C, N and P. They were incubated at four temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C) at either 60% or 100% water holding capacity (WHC). Our results showed that chemical and biological properties play an important role in determining soil respiration responses to temperature and moisture changes. High soil C : P and C : N ratios were symptomatic of slow C turnover and long-term C accumulation. In boreal soils, low bacterial to fungal ratios were related to greater temperature sensitivity of respiration, which was amplified in drier conditions. This contrasted with peatland soils which were dominated by bacterial communities and enchytraeid grazing, resulting in a more rapid C turnover under warmer and wetter conditions. The unexpected acceleration of C mineralization under high moisture contents was possibly linked to the primarily role of fermented organic matter, instead of oxygen, in mediating microbial decomposition. We conclude that to improve C model simulations of soil respiration, a better resolution of the interactions occurring between climate, resource quality and the decomposer community will be required.

AB Peat in the discontinuous permafrost zone contains a globally significant reservoir of carbon that has undergone multiple permafrost-thaw cycles since the end of the mid-Holocene (similar to 3700 years before present). Periods of thaw increase C decomposition rates which leads to the release of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere creating potential climate feedback. To determine the magnitude and direction of such feedback, we measured CO2 and CH4 emissions and modeled C accumulation rates and radiative fluxes from measurements of two radioactive tracers with differing lifetimes to describe the C balance of the peatland over multiple permafrost-thaw cycles since the initiation of permafrost at the site. At thaw features, the balance between increased primary production and higher CH4 emission stimulated by warmer temperatures and wetter conditions favors C sequestration and enhanced peat accumulation. Flux measurements suggest that frozen plateaus may intermittently (order of years to decades) act as CO2 sources depending on temperature and net ecosystem respiration rates, but modeling results suggest that-despite brief periods of net C loss to the atmosphere at the initiation of thaw-integrated over millennia, these sites have acted as net C sinks via peat accumulation. In greenhouse gas terms, the transition from frozen permafrost to thawed wetland is accompanied by increasing CO2 uptake that is partially offset by increasing CH4 emissions. In the short-term (decadal time scale) the net effect of this transition is likely enhanced warming via increased radiative C emissions, while in the long-term (centuries) net C deposition provides a negative feedback to climate warming.

AB Extreme climate events are increasing in frequency and duration and may directly impact belowground foodwebs and the activities of component soil organisms. The soil invertebrate community, which includes keystone decomposers, might respond to these newly induced soil microclimate conditions by shifts in density, species composition, spatial patterning and/or functional traits.
   To test if and how short-term extreme climatic conditions alter the structure, the vertical stratification and the community weighted trait means of the springtail (Collembola) community in sub-arctic peatbogs, we experimentally subjected Sphagnum peat cores in a field setting to factorial treatments of elevated temperature and episodically increased moisture content.
   The large precipitation peaks did not affect the springtail community, but an average soil temperature increase of 4 degrees C halved its density in the shallower peat layers, mainly caused by the reduced dominance of Folsomia quadrioculata. A hypothesized net downward shift of the surface-dwelling springtail community, however, was not observed. We observed species-specific responses to warming but the overall community composition in subsequent organic layers was not significantly altered. Although the effects of an extreme warming event on density, species composition and vertical stratification pattern seemed subtle, functional trait analysis revealed directional community responses, i.e. an overall increase of soil-dwelling species due to warming, even though warming did not alter layer-specific community weighted trait means.
   We suggest that subtle changes in moisture conditions, due to increased evapotranspiration, have decreased typically surface-dwelling species relative to soil-dwelling species. The extent to which this directional change in the community is maintained after an extreme event, and its costs for the community's resilience to multiple sequential extreme events will consequently determine its longer-term effects on the community and on ecosystem functioning.

AB Black spruce (Picea mariana) peatlands play important ecologic and economic roles in the temperate-boreal region of North America, providing a valuable timber resource while also performing important ecosystem functions. Climate models project decreases in the amount of snowfall received throughout the temperate-boreal region by 2100, as average wintertime temperatures increase. We used a paired-plot experimental design to assess the effect of snow removal on soil temperature and frost development at six forested peatland sites in northern Minnesota, USA, during the three winters from 2017 to 2020. Treatments consisted of 1) removal of snow throughout the winter, or 2) ambient snow cover conditions. During the three years of the study, there was a significant effect of snow removal by mid-winter that continued into late winter and spring, where removal of snow increased soil frost depth compared to plots with ambient snow cover treatment. Soil temperatures in the removal plots were highly responsive to air temperature fluctuations to depths of 20 cm or more, whereas the ambient snow cover soils exhibited little fluctuation and degrees maintained temperatures near or above 0 C for much of the winter season. We found that each cumulative freezing degree day resulted in an average of 0.36 cm of soil frost development in snow removal plots, as compared to 0.07 cm depth in the ambient treatment plots. Soils were significantly colder through much of the summer growing season in the removal treatment compared to the ambient treatment, with detectable soil frost in the soil profile as late as mid- to late-June. These results indicate that predicted changes in wintertime precipitation may result in increased development of soil frost in forested peatland systems, although some of this effect may be offset by predicted concurrent increases in air temperature. We did not measure indicators of biological activity, but the large and prolonged reduction in soil temperature with snow removal is likely to depress biological activity throughout the growing season and the many ecosystem functions it influences. Because of the role that soil temperature and frost play on the hydrologic and ecological processes of peatlands, as well as the crucial role of soil frost in peatland forest management, findings of this study provide important insight into the potential effects of altered winter conditions on these expansive and ecologically important ecosystems.

AB Long-term increases in DOC concentration in rivers draining areas of upland peat are a ubiquitous phenomenon in the UK. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these increases, but one compelling explanation is the observed long-term increase in temperature in UK uplands causing increases in peat decomposition rates, and increasing the depth of oxidation as evaporation increases depth to the water table. The study constructed an empirical model for water table depth and decomposition rate calibrated against observations from the Environmental Change Network monitoring site at Moor House in the North Pennines, UK. The study shows: (i) Depth of the water table has not changed significantly over a 30-year period, reflecting the fact that blanket peat is well buffered against climate change. (ii) Increases in temperature are responsible for a 12% increase in DOC production while an approximate 78% increase in DOC production has been observed. (iii) Overall DOC production is predicted to rise by 6% but observation suggests increases on the scale of 97%. (iv) The model inadequately represents changes in production and supply of DOC during periods of severe drought. The study shows that temperature change alone is insufficient to explain observed increases in DOC production. Alternative explanations for large increases in DOC production could include changes in land management, but an enzymic latch mechanism, i.e. derepression of anaerobic degradation, causing increased decomposition rates in response to severe drought is preferred.

AB Sedges (Cyperaceae) are dominant plants in many northern wetlands and contribute to the carbon cycling in several ways. In order to more accurately estimate the carbon balance of a wetland it is essential to be able to simulate the temporal changes of the leaf area of the sedges. Our aim was to test the ability of a simple carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange model to predict the seasonal development of sedge leaf area index (LAI). The model simulates the development of sedge LAI that depends on carbon gain/loss in net photosynthesis, utilization of stored carbon in spring, and LAI decline due to senescence in late summer. The net photosynthesis model is driven by LA!, air temperature, water table depth and photosynthetically active radiation. We parameterized and validated the model with two years of observational LAI data from two boreal pristine peatland sites and included data points from both pristine and manipulated (drainage and warming) treatment plots. Model parameter values other than the timing of the start of senescence, LAI decline rate in senescence and size of carbon storage were independent of observational data. The model successfully simulated the seasonal course of LAI development and is thus an easy and adjustable tool for producing estimates of sedge LAI for other peatland sites. It can be adjusted to different sites although it cannot predict the exact LAI level of a site that is controlled by site characteristics. Its ability to simulate the interannual variation in this two-year dataset was inadequate so there is a need to test the model against longer time series of measured LAIs in order to validate models' capability to predict the interannual variability of LAI.

AB Low-frequency mowing has been proposed to be an effective strategy for the restoration and management of boreal fens after abandonment of traditional haymaking. This study investigates how mowing affects long-term vegetation change in both oceanic and continental boreal rich-fen vegetation. This will allow evaluation of the effectiveness of mowing as a management and restoration tool in this ecosystem in the face of climate change. At two nature reserves in Central Norway (Tagdalen, 63 degrees 03' N, 9 degrees 05 E, oceanic climate and Solendet, 62 degrees 40' N, 11 degrees 50' E, continental climate), we used permanent plot data from the two sites to compare plant species composition from the late 1960s to the early 1980s with that recorded in 2012-2015 in abandoned and mown fens. Changes in species composition and frequency were analysed by multivariate and univariate methods in relation to environmental variables and modelled climate and groundwater data. Mowing resulted in a decline in shrub and Molinia caerulea cover at the continental and oceanic sites respectively, and the total cover of specialist fen species had increased to a significantly greater extent in the mown plots than the unmown at the continental site. However, mowing did not have an effect on the cover of specialist bryophyte species, and some specialist species declined regardless of mowing treatment. Temperature sums had increased at both sites, but precipitation had not changed significantly. Mowing was shown to be the most important determinant of plant community composition at both sites, with local environmental conditions being of secondary importance. In conclusion, the abandonment of traditional management practices results in the loss of characteristic fen species. In order to encourage the restoration of typical rich-fen vegetation, particularly in oceanic areas, additional management measures, such as more intensive mowing, may be required.

AB Continuous half-hourly net CO2 exchange measurements were made using nine automatic chambers in a treed fen in northern Alberta, Canada from June-October in 2005 and from May-October in 2006. The 2006 growing season was warmer and drier than in 2005. The average chamber respiration rates normalized to 10 degrees C were much higher in 2006 than in 2005, while calculations of the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) values were similar in the two years. Daytime average respiration values were lower than the corresponding, temperature-corrected respiration rates calculated from night-time chamber measurements. From June to September, the season-integrated estimates of chamber photosynthesis and respiration were 384 and 590 g C m-2, respectively in 2006, an increase of 100 and 203 g C m-2 over the corresponding values in 2005. The season-integrated photosynthesis and respiration rates obtained using the eddy covariance technique, which included trees and a tall shrub not present in the chambers, were 720 and 513 g C m-2, respectively, in 2006, an increase of 50 and 125 g C m-2 over the corresponding values in 2005. While both photosynthesis and respiration rates were higher in the warmer and drier conditions of 2006, the increase in respiration was more than twice the increase in photosynthesis.

AB Leaf wax n-alkanes in peat deposits are important proxies for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The n-alkane compositions of Sphagnum species, which are important peat forming plants, are commonly dominated by the C-23 and C-25 homologs. However, questions remain about the stability of Sphagnum-derived n-alkanes to early diagenetic alterations. In this study, a 13-month litterbag decomposition study using Sphagnum palustre collected from the Dajiuhu peatland, central China, was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions to assess the influences of redox (aerobic vs anaerobic) conditions and environmental temperatures (15 degrees C vs 25 degrees C) on the chain-length distributions and carbon isotopic compositions of Sphagnum n-alkanes. Results clearly reveal the preferential degradation under aerobic conditions of mid-chain n-alkanes relative to their long-chain homologs (C-29 and C-31), resulting in the increase of the relative proportions of long-chain n-alkanes. The change in n-alkane distribution is accompanied by an increase in the delta C-13 values of the mid-chain n-alkanes, whereas those of the long-chain n-alkanes remain nearly constant. In contrast, neither chain-length distributions nor n-alkane delta C-13 values were much affected under anaerobic degradation conditions. Statistical analysis reveals that redox conditions play significant roles in the degradation of Sphagnum n-alkanes, whereas the influence of air temperature is not significant. These findings will improve applications of n-alkane paleoenvironmental proxies to reconstruct the types of plants and the depositional conditions that contributed to peat sequences, particularly under settings with fluctuating water levels that affect redox conditions.

AB Reconstruction of the magnitude and frequency of past floods is important for assessments of flood risk. However, there have been few reconstructions of past flood activity based on long-term continuous records from a single fluvial system and thus suitable for comparison with other paleoclimate proxies. Consequently, the influence of climate change on flood activity remains unclear. Floodplain peat beds can be preserved for long periods of geologic time; they also contain both elastic sediments from overbank flooding and organic material produced in situ, both of which are important inputs for geologic reconstructions. In this study, we examined 24 cores from the Ishikari lowland, northern Japan, to find out if temporal changes of loss on ignition (LOI) of peat can provide a record of flood magnitude and frequency and to investigate the influence of regional climate change on flood activity. Our plant macrofossil analyses, the distribution of characteristic LOI depth profiles, and sedimentary facies suggest that the LOI of peat increases when the magnitude and frequency of floods decreases, which in turn suggests that temporal changes of LOI in peat might be useful as a proxy for past flood activity. Our results indicate that increases in the LOI of peat deposited near the Ishikari River at ca. 5500-5000 and 4000-3500 cal BP may correspond to weakened activities of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Furthermore, our analyses show that an increase in flood activity of the Ishikari River during 1400-1300 cal BP may be related to a decrease in ENSO activity. However, temporal changes of the LOI of peat formed near a tributary of the Ishikari River did not correlate with these climate changes. Our results suggest that the past flood activity of rivers with large watersheds reflects regional climate change, because the extensive precipitation that induces flooding of such rivers is generally associated with regional climate systems such as the EASM and ENSO, whereas this association is not necessarily the case for rivers with small watersheds.

AB Quantifying landscape-scale methane (CH4) fluxes from boreal and arctic regions, and determining how they are controlled, is critical for predicting the magnitude of any CH4 emission feedback to climate change. Furthermore, there remains uncertainty regarding the relative importance of small areas of strong methanogenic activity, vs. larger areas with net CH4 uptake, in controlling landscape-level fluxes. We measured CH4 fluxes from multiple microtopographical subunits (sedge-dominated lawns, interhummocks and hummocks) within an aapa mire in subarctic Finland, as well as in drier ecosystems present in the wider landscape, lichen heath and mountain birch forest. An intercomparison was carried out between fluxes measured using static chambers, up-scaled using a high-resolution landcover map derived from aerial photography and eddy covariance. Strong agreement was observed between the two methodologies, with emission rates greatest in lawns. CH4 fluxes from lawns were strongly related to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, but their floating nature meant that water-table depth was not a key factor in controlling CH4 release. In contrast, chamber measurements identified net CH4 uptake in birch forest soils. An intercomparison between the aerial photography and satellite remote sensing demonstrated that quantifying the distribution of the key CH4 emitting and consuming plant communities was possible from satellite, allowing fluxes to be scaled up to a 100km(2) area. For the full growing season (May to October), similar to 1.1-1.4g CH(4)m(-2) was released across the 100km(2) area. This was based on up-scaled lawn emissions of 1.2-1.5g CH(4)m(-2), vs. an up-scaled uptake of 0.07-0.15g CH(4)m(-2) by the wider landscape. Given the strong temperature sensitivity of the dominant lawn fluxes, and the fact that lawns are unlikely to dry out, climate warming may substantially increase CH4 emissions in northern Finland, and in aapa mire regions in general.

AB The temperate and boreal forests of Europe and North America have been subject to repeated pathogen (fungal disease and phytophagus insect) outbreaks over the last 100 years. Palaeoecology can, potentially, offer a long-term perspective on such disturbance episodes, providing information on their triggers, frequency and impact. Mid-Holocene declines in Tsuga and Ulmus pollen dominate the Quaternary literature on forest pathogens, yet the role of pathogens, and even the presence of pathogenic fungal diseases, during these events has yet to be established. Pathogen-focused research strategies, informed by the sequence of events documented in modern outbreaks, and undertaken at high temporal resolution using a multi-proxy approach, are required. It is argued that forest pathogens are likely to have been significant agents of past vegetation change, even in cases where climate change was the primary stress factor.

AB Sea-level rise and frequent intense hurricanes associated with climate change will result in recurrent flooding of inland systems such as Gulf Coastal pitcher plant bogs by storm surges. These surges can transport salt water and sediment to freshwater bogs, greatly affecting their biological integrity. Purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia rosea) are Gulf Coast pitcher plant bog inhabitants that could be at a disadvantage under this scenario because their pitcher morphology may leave them prone to collection of saline water and sediment after a surge. We investigated the effects of storm surge water salinity and sediment type on S. rosea vitality, plant community structure, and bog soil-water conductivity. Plots (containing >= 1 ramet of S. rosea) were experimentally flooded with fresh or saline water crossed with one of three sediment types (local, foreign, or no sediment). There were no treatment effects on soil-water conductivity; nevertheless, direct exposure to saline water resulted in significantly lower S. rosea cover until the following season when a prescribed fire and regional drought contributed to the decline of all the S. rosea to near zero percent cover. There were also significant differences in plant community structure between treatments over time, reflecting how numerous species increased in abundance and a few species decreased in abundance. However, in contrast to S. rosea, most of the other species in the community appeared resilient to the effects of storm surge. Thus, although the community may be somewhat affected by storm surge, those few species that are particularly sensitive to the storm surge disturbance will likely drop out of the community and be replaced by more resilient species. Depending on the longevity of these biological legacies, Gulf Coastal pitcher plant bogs may be incapable of fully recovering if they become exposed to storm surge more frequently due to climate change.

AB Most previous studies on methane (CH4) emissions from peatlands have focused on the boreal, subarctic, and tropical regions. Little is known about CH4 emissions from the alpine peatlands that are widely distributed in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which are sensitive to climate change and human disturbance. To assess the magnitudes of daily and seasonal variations in CH4 flux in this area, and to identify the influential environmental factors, an eddy covariance (EC) tower with a LI-7700 open-path CH4 analyzer was established on Hongyuan Peatland. Total annual CH4 emission was 46.8 g CH(4)m(-2) in 2014, with emissions in the non-growing season accounting for 25% of the annual total. From May to September 2014, diurnal variation in CH4 emissions was observed, with CH4 fluxes varying between 0.15 and 0.25 mu molm(-2) s(-1). In contrast, during all other periods of 2014, no diurnal variation was observed, and CH4 flux varied below 0.05 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). A clear seasonal pattern in CH4 exchange with small surges in CH4 emission appeared in soil thawing and freezing seasons. Wavelet analysis was applied to the continuous CH4 flux time series to explore temporal variation in ecosystem CH4 exchange during the growing season. On daily timescales, changes in CH4 flux are in phase with changes in air temperature, and influenced by friction velocity and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). On weekly-to-monthly timescales, soil temperature can explain most of the variation in CH4 exchange. Though CH4 fluxes had no apparent correlation with water table level, fluxes were significantly (R-2 = 0.86) correlated with soil temperature measured at -25 cm depth, close to the water table level throughout the growing season, suggesting a synergistic effect of water table level and soil temperature on methane emission. This study highlights the need for continuous eddy covariance measurements and time series analysis approaches to adequately describe temporal variability in ecosystem CH4 exchange.

AB Trafficability in forest terrain is controlled by ground-bearing capacity, which is crucial from the timber harvesting point of view. In winter, soil frost affects the most the bearing capacity, especially on peatland soils which have in general low bearing capacity. Ground frost similarly affects the bearing capacity of forest truck roads. A 20 cm thick layer of frozen soil or 40 cm thick layer of snow on the ground may already be sufficient for heavy forest harvesters. In this work, we studied the impacts of climate change on soil frost conditions and, consequently, on ground-bearing capacity from the timber harvesting point of view. The number of days with good wintertime bearing capacity was modelled by using a soil temperature model with a snow accumulation model and wide set of downscaled climate model data until the end of the 21st century. The model was calibrated for different forest and soil types. The results show that by the mid-21st century, the conditions with good bearing capacity will decrease in wintertime in Finland, most likely by about 1 month. The decrease in soil frost and wintertime bearing capacity will be more pronounced during the latter half of the century, when drained peatlands may virtually lack soil frost in most of winters in southern and western Finland. The projected decrease in the bearing capacity, accompanied with increasing demand for wood harvesting from drained peatlands, induces a clear need for the development of sustainable and resource-efficient logging practices for drained peatlands. This is also needed to avoid unnecessary harvesting damages, like rut formation on soils and damage to tree roots and stems.

AB Water table decline is a major threat to soil organic carbon in peatlands worldwide principally because it may largely increase soil CO2 emission (SCE). This study is to determine the response of SCE to water table decline in the Zoige peatland of Tibetan Plateau, which has experienced rapid decline of water table due to climate change and anthropogenic drainage. We conducted a field in situ drainage experiment consisting of low (plots surrounded by 50 cm deep ditches), intermediate (20 cm deep) and high (intact) water table levels. The experiment lasted for about four years, during which we measured SCE rate and associated variables including soil temperature and moisture with a higher frequency in the growing season (May-September) than the non-growing season (October-April). Experimental drainage decreased water table height by ca. 12 cm and 15 cm (relative to the intact) and soil moisture (at 5 cm soil) by 6% and 12% (relative to 45% in the intact) on average in intermediate and low water table treatments, respectively, but it did not affect soil temperature during the experimental years.
   The effect of drainage on SCE varied with season. In the non-growing season, the drainage effect was nonsignificant in each measurement possibly because the low-temperature effect overrode the drainage effect on SCE. In the growing season, the drainage mostly increased the emission except for several cases, in which a negative effect was observed. The negative effect of drainage could be due to the low soil moisture (< 25%) in the drained treatments. Provided that the magnitude and the duration of the SCE increase were greater than those of the decrease, it can be estimated that drainage increased SCE by 17% and 20% on average in the low and the intermediate water table treatments, respectively, over the experimental years. Our results suggest that water table decline may facilitate net carbon emission and hence decrease soil carbon storage in the Zoige peatland. We call for artificial filling of the ditches that were historically created by both human beings and storm waters to increase water table in the Zoige peatland.

DE RS image; DEM image; GIS analysis; peatland area change; the Altay

AB Analyses results of total peatland area changes in the southern Altay Mountain region over the past 20 years are discussed in this paper. These analyses were based on remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) studies. Possible control methods are evaluated by comparing these results to other regional records and climate data. The area of the peatland zones was calculated by overlaying a peatland layer of Landsat TM (Thematic Map) image constructed by using supervised classification with a layer of slope based on a digital elevation model (DEM). The results show that slope layer is crucial to improving the accuracy of peatland extracted from TM images. The peatland area of the Altay Mountains increased from 931.5 km(2) in 1990 to 977.7 km(2) in 2010. This trend is consistent with the climate change in this region, due in part to increasing temperatures and precipitation, suggesting possible climate controls on peatland expansion. The increase in the peatland area in the Altay Mountains over the last 20 years has been influenced by the westerlies. Alternatively, changes in the largest highland peatland area of the Zoige Basin, located in the eastern Tibetan Plateau have been influenced by the intensity of the Asian summer monsoons. In addition to increased temperatures, decreased precipitation in the Zoige Basin and increased precipitation in the Altay Mountains, due to varied patterns of atmospheric circulation, are the probable causes for driving the change differences in these two peatland areas.

AB This is a study of the spatial and temporal variability of total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions from vegetation and soil at a subarctic mire, northern Sweden. THCs include methane (CH4) and nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), both of which are atmospherically important trace gases and constitute a significant proportion of the carbon exchange between biosphere and atmosphere. Reliable characterization of the magnitude and the dynamics of the THC fluxes from high latitude peatlands are important when considering to what extent trace gas emissions from such ecosystems may change and feed back on climate regulation as a result of warmer climate and melting permafrost. High frequency measurements of THC and carbon dioxide (CO2) were conducted during four sequential growing seasons in three localities representing the trophic range of plant communities at the mire. The magnitude of the THC flux followed the moisture gradient with increasing emissions from a dry Palsa site (2.2 +/- 0.1 mgC m(-2) d(-1)), to a wet intermediate melt feature with Sphagnum spp. (28 +/- 0.3 mgC m(-2) d(-1)) and highest emissions from a wet Eriophorum spp. site (122 +/- 1.4 mgC m(-2) d(-1)) (overall mean +/- 1 SE, n = 2254, 2231 and 2137). At the Palsa site, daytime THC flux was most strongly related to air temperature while daytime THC emissions at the Sphagnum site had a stronger relation to ground temperature. THC emissions at both the wet sites were correlated to net ecosystem exchange of CO2. An overall spatial correlation indicated that areas with highly productive vegetation communities also had high THC emission potential.

AB Peatland soils are estimated to store a third of all terrestrial carbon stocks and are very sensitive to climate change. In these systems, one group of soil mesofauna, enchytraeid worms (Annelida, Oligochaeta), represent up to 70% of total soil fauna biomass and previous studies have highlighted their potential use as 'biological indicators' for functionally important changes in the C cycle.
   To examine the link between temperature, enchytraeids and carbon fluxes we performed a microcosm experiment in which we assessed the influence of temperature on enchytraeid populations and soil CO2 and DOC release from a Galician peatland soil over 90 days. Additionally, to unravel the potential underlying mechanisms responsible for DOC production, we also tested the effects of increasing temperatures and enchytraeid activities on the presence of organic chelating metals (iron and aluminium) and hydrogen ions (i.e. acidity) in the soil solution.
   Enchytraeid population numbers and biomass increased over time at both temperature treatments (14 and 19 degrees C), with the greatest increase produced at the highest temperature (to over five and seven times higher initial values, respectively, by day 88). Results also showed that, under warmer conditions, enchytraeid activities increased both CO2 fluxes and DOC release by twofold (Q(10) values of 3.9 and 3.6, respectively).
   The combined effect of temperature and enchytraeids promoted the breakdown of organic substances and consequently, more DOC and iron were leached. An important decline in H+ release was observed when enchytraeids were present and possibly eliminating one of the critical mechanisms restricting DOC release. These leachate pH values were also responsible for aluminium immobilisation and hence for its insignificant role in the export of DOC from the peat soil.
   We conclude that temperature change alone does not explain all the observed increases in soil respiration and DOC production but rather soil invertebrate responses to warming are crucial in controlling C fluxes in peatland soils. This is the result of temperature induced changes of enchytraeid populations and activities which have the potential of speeding up the decomposition of organic matter and altering soil aeration, metal mobilization and acidity of the soil solution, with important implications for the global carbon cycle.
   There is an urgent need for incorporating the response of soil biology in climate change modelling to make better predictions of future changes in terrestrial carbon pools.

AB Testate amoebae analysis has been shown to be a valuable technique to reconstruct peatland palaeohydrology and thereby past climate change. However there is cause for concern over the potential impact of differential preservation on the record. To investigate the impact of various environmental factors a sequence of Sphagnum samples were subjected to treatment with weak acid, nutrient enrichment and desiccation over 28-months and shorter-term experiments with stronger acids. Changes were subtle but statistically significant with three treatments: long-term dessication and short-term acid treatment at two different concentrations. Results suggest that in dry periods the palaeoecological record may be skewed by differential preservation of tests, potentially leading to over-estimation of water table depths.

Recent years suggested an increasing risk of drought occurrence and restricted water supply even in usually humid mountain regions. Our research is focused on the evaluation of regional climate change and its effect on hydrological drought characteristics in headwater areas in the Ore Mountains along the Czech/German border. The main aim was to evaluate and compare streamflow regime changes and trends in long-term hydrological and climatic time series within selected sub-catchments of the Svatava (Zwota) River, the Rolava River, and the Nacetinsky Brook (Natzschung). A comparative statistical analysis for the 1967-2018 period was performed using various homogeneity and trend tests. Longer runoff time series with earlier beginnings were examined for two catchments as well. The results pointed to significant, continuous warming in the region which is accompanied by decreasing trends in snow cover depths in the colder half of the year. Drought indices based on runoff data were derived in the Indicators of Hydrologic Alterations (IHA 7.1) software environment. The seasonality of hydrological drought occurrence changed markedly after 1992, when most severe drought events started to concentrate between August and October in the study area. Increasing trends in deficit volumes were found in two catchments characterized by lower elevation. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in average and minimum flows in spring and summer months in all catchments observed between 1967 and 2018 despite relatively stable amounts of precipitation and land cover.

AB Stream temperature is a fundamental physical characteristic of rivers, influencing biological productivity and water quality. Given the implications of climate warming for stream thermal regimes, it is an important consideration in river management plans. Energy exchanges at the water-air interface, channel geomorphology, riparian vegetation and advective heat transport from the different sources of discharge can all influence stream temperature. A simple mixing equation was used to investigate heat transport and to estimate daily mean and maximum stream temperatures on the basis of mixing groundwater and near-surface flows from riparian wetlands as end-members in a peatland catchment. The resulting data were evaluated against energy balance components and saturation extent to investigate the importance of riparian wetlands in determining stream temperatures. Data fit was generally good in periods with extensive saturation and poorest in dry periods with less hydrological connectivity, when reduced saturation and low flows increased the relative influence of energy exchange at the stream-atmosphere interface. These findings have implications in terms of climate change and land management, where the planting of riparian buffer strips to moderate water temperatures may be less effective when saturation area is extensive and hydrological connectivity is high.

AB Boreal wetlands, primarily peatlands, are important global carbon (C) reservoirs and integral components of regional hydrological networks. This paper summarizes our current state of knowledge regarding components of water and nutrient budgets in northern wetlands, with a focus on Canada. Boreal wetland water budgets are strongly influenced by the following: seasonal weather patterns as they relate to the timing of precipitation and meltwater inputs and evapotranspiration (ET) losses; vegetation cover in the wetland and surrounding uplands as it relates to rain and snow interception and evapotranspiration; and connectivity of the wetland to the regional hydrological network. Key factors that influence boreal wetland phosphorus (P) budgets are: spatial and temporal variability in the water table as they relate to reduction-oxidation conditions and rewetting of highly decomposed peat; concentrations of metals and ions involved in P complexation and release; vegetation age and type (herbaceous versus woody); and seasonal weather patterns as they relate to water retention time. As with other components of the boreal forest, wetlands are often limited in bioavailable nitrogen (N), therefore bulk deposition and symbiotic fixation are key N sources. Within many wetlands, N is rapidly cycled through vegetation and microbial communities, and converted to gaseous N or exported as organic N in outflows. In terms of C budgets, boreal wetlands are important reservoirs, converting inorganic and organic C inputs to peat. Climate change and anthropogenic N loading threaten the water and C balance in boreal wetlands.

AB Northern peatlands store ca. 1/3 of the world's soil organic carbon and this is attributed to low decomposition rates as a result of waterlogged, anaerobic conditions and high levels of phenolic substances. Climate change models predict both an increase in summer droughts and increased rainfall, depending on region, but information on the effect of these changes on the microbial population that mediate phenolic degradation is sparse. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGGE) was therefore used to assess the effect of simulated summer drought and increased rainfall on the diversity of phenolic degrading bacteria in a northern peatland using the gene XylE, encoding for the enzyme Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), as an indicator. Under simulated drought, a greater diversity (129.4%, P < 0.05) and abundance of phenolic catabolising bacterial species was found. Concurrent increased total phenol oxidase activities (83.3%) and beta-glucosidase activities (157.6%, P < 0.01) were found with consistently lower concentrations of phenolic compounds, DOC and increased CO2 fluxes. This increased mineralisation is likely to lower carbon storage capacity and increase climate forcing. Conversely, the increased rainfall simulation suppressed diversity (62.2%, P < 0.05), abundance and phenol oxidase activities (103.3%, P < 0.001), giving increased phenolic compound (424.8%, P < 0.1 only) and DOC concentrations (201.3%, P < 0.001), along with increased anaerobic trace gas fluxes. These hugely increased aquatic carbon concentrations available for export are of serious concern due to their deleterious effect on drinking water quality. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the importance of soil and surface waters freezing in permafrost landscapes, the behaviour of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrients and metals during periodic freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) remains poorly known. The on-going climate warming is likely to increase the frequency of FTC in continental aquatic settings, which could modify the chemical composition of waters. In this study, we conducted 9 repetitive cycles of overnight freezing (similar to 20 degrees C) and 5 h thawing (4 degrees C) in the laboratory using representative 0.22 mu m-filtered waters from NE European permafrost peatland: leachates of vegetation and soil, and natural surface waters (depression, thermokarst lake and river). Only minor (<5%-15%) changes of DOC concentrations, SUVA(254) and molecular weight were observed in all leachates and the depression water. In contrast, several trace elements (Fe, Al, P, Mn, As, and REE) exhibited sizable variations during FTC (>10%). The leachates and the depression water were enriched in trace elements, whereas the thermokarst lake and the river demonstrated a decrease in concentration of Fe (similar to 39 and similar to 94%, respectively), Al (similar to 9 and similar to 85%), and Mn (similar to 10 and similar to 79%) during FTC. Overall, the observations demonstrated an increase in aliphatic low molecular weight organic matter (OM), and the precipitation of Fe, Al hydroxides and organo-mineral particles. Therefore, enhanced of frequency of FTC can favour the release of metals and toxicants from acidic OM-rich surface waters and maintain stable OM-metalscolloids in large lakes and rivers, thus regulating aquatic transport of DOC and metals from soils to the Arctic Ocean.

AB A year-long field survey was carried out at a valley-bottom riparian peatland site in North Wales, UK from January 2002 to December 2002 to examine the seasonal variation of decomposition processes and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Peat temperature, physicochernistry, organic carbon pools, basal CO2 respiration and extracellular enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, phosphatase, sulphatase and phenol oxidase) were monitored monthly. The results of a principle component eigenanalysis of field data show that concentrations of basal CO2 respiration, soil solution DOC and phenolics were positively correlated to soil temperature (P < 0.01, F=12.25; P < 0.001, F=59.8; P < 0.001, F=141.27) with Q(10) responses of 2.29, 6.42 and 14.42, respectively. Extracellular enzyme activities, however, were more strongly associated with seasonal changes in ion concentrations and did not correspond significantly to temperature alone suggesting limitations attributable to a combination of continuous anaerobiosis and/or the suppressive compounds. Restraints on soil enzyme activities may limit the loss of CO2 from the microbial community that is dependent on soil enzyme activities for nutrient availability. The seasonal effect of temperature on DOC may be explained by increased plant rhizodeposition and microbial activity. These results do not imply that the long-term increasing trend in DOC export is explainable by temperature increase but suggest that temperature may be a key factor regulating the seasonal variation in DOC concentrations. Thus, seasonal temperature effects on DOC may represent an important component of long-term models of DOC export. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims Start and end of the growing season determine important ecosystem processes, but their drivers may differ above-and belowground, between autumn and spring, and between ecosystems.
   Here, we compare above-and belowground spring and autumn phenology, and their abiotic drivers (temperature, water level, and soil moisture) in four temperate ecosystems (beech forest, alder carr, phragmites reed, and sedge reed).
   Methods Root growth was measured in-situ with minirhizotrons and compared with aboveground phenology assessed with dendrometer data and NDVI.
   Results Synchrony of above- and belowground phenology depended on ecosystem. Onset of root growth was later than shoot growth in all three peatlands (12-33 days), but similar in the beech forest. The growing season ended earlier belowground in the two forested ecosystems (beech forest: 27 days, understory of the alder carr: 55 days), but did not differ in the phragmites reed. Generally, root production was correlated with soil temperature (especially in spring) and water level in the peatlands, while abiotic factors were less correlated with leaf activity or root production in either spring or autumn in the beech forest.
   Conclusions Root production on organic soils was ten times higher compared to the zonal broadleaf deciduous forest on mineral soils, highlighting the importance of peatlands. Belowground phenology cannot be projected from aboveground phenology and measuring root phenology is crucial to understand temporal dynamics of production and carbon fluxes.

AB To predict future spatio-temporal patterns of climate change, we should fully understand the spatio-temporal patterns of climate change during the past millennium. But, we are not yet able to delineate the patterns because the qualities of the retrieved proxy records and the spatial coverage of those records are not adequate. Northern Xinjiang of China is one of such areas where the records are not adequate. Here, we present a 500-yr land-surface moisture sequence from Heiyangpo Peat (48.34A degrees N, 87.18A degrees E, 1353 m a.s.l) in the southern Altai Mountains within northern Xinjiang. Specifically, peat carbon isotope value of cellulose (delta C-13(cellulose)) was used to estimate the warm-season moisture variations and the degree of humification was used to constrain the delta C-13(cellulose)-based hydrological interpretation. The climatic attributions of the interpreted hydrological variations were based on the warm-season temperature reconstructed from Belukha ice core and the warm-season precipitation inferred from the reconstructed Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations (AMO). The results show that humification decreased and the delta C-13(cellulose)-suggested moisture decreased from similar to 1510 to similar to 1775 AD, implying that a constant drying condition may have inhibited peat decay. Our comparison with reconstructed climatic parameters suggests that the moisture-level decline was most likely resulted from a constant decline of precipitation. The results also show that humification kept a stable level and the delta C-13(cellulose)-suggested moisture also decreased from similar to 1775 to similar to 2013 AD, implying that peat decay in the acrotelm primarily did not depend on the water availability or an aerobic environment. Again, our comparison with reconstructed climatic parameters suggests that the land-surface moisturelevel decline was most likely resulted from a steady warming of growing-season temperature.

AB Lowland boreal forest ecosystems in Alaska are dominated by wetlands comprised of a complex mosaic of fens, collapse-scar bogs, low shrub/scrub, and forests growing on elevated ice-rich permafrost soils. Thermokarst has affected the lowlands of the Tanana Flats in central Alaska for centuries, as thawing permafrost collapses forests that transition to wetlands. Located within the discontinuous permafrost zone, this region has significantly warmed over the past half-century, and much of these carbon-rich permafrost soils are now within similar to 0.5 degrees C of thawing. Increased permafrost thaw in lowland boreal forests in response to warming may have consequences for the climate system. This study evaluates the trajectories and potential drivers of 60years of forest change in a landscape subjected to permafrost thaw in unburned dominant forest types (paper birch and black spruce) associated with location on elevated permafrost plateau and across multiple time periods (1949, 1978, 1986, 1998, and 2009) using historical and contemporary aerial and satellite images for change detection. We developed (i) a deterministic statistical model to evaluate the potential climatic controls on forest change using gradient boosting and regression tree analysis, and (ii) a 30x30m land cover map of the Tanana Flats to estimate the potential landscape-level losses of forest area due to thermokarst from 1949 to 2009. Over the 60-year period, we observed a nonlinear loss of birch forests and a relatively continuous gain of spruce forest associated with thermokarst and forest succession, while gradient boosting/regression tree models identify precipitation and forest fragmentation as the primary factors controlling birch and spruce forest change, respectively. Between 1950 and 2009, landscape-level analysis estimates a transition of similar to 15km(2) or similar to 7% of birch forests to wetlands, where the greatest change followed warm periods. This work highlights that the vulnerability and resilience of lowland ice-rich permafrost ecosystems to climate changes depend on forest type.

AB Northern landscapes accumulate carbon in vegetation and soils while rivers transport significant amounts of land-derived carbon to coastal areas. Here, we quantify carbon sources and sinks in main ecosystems (forests, peatlands, mountains, agricultural areas, lakes) in Norway for 1990-2008, and compare riverine carbon transport with terrestrial carbon accumulation in Norway's four major discharge areas. Mean annual carbon accumulation (6.0 +/- A 0.9 Tg C; 19 g C m(-2)) in terrestrial ecosystems balanced 40 % of national greenhouse gas emissions. The area-normalized terrestrial sink strength declined in the following order (in g C m(-2) year(-1)): tree biomass (40 +/- A 3) > peatlands (19 +/- A 15) > forest soils (9 +/- A 1) a parts per thousand << lakes (2 +/- A 1) > mountains (0.5 +/- A 0.3), while agricultural soils were sources of carbon (-36 +/- A 74). The most precise estimate in the carbon balance was for tree biomass, because of the underlying forest inventory data. Poor data on land management and soil type in agricultural soils, and on (former) drainage and peatland type resulted in high uncertainty in carbon loss and uptake estimates in agricultural soils and peatlands, which impacted the uncertainty in total terrestrial carbon accumulation. Also, carbon losses from disturbance in organic soil types were poorly constrained. Riverine coastal inputs of land-derived organic carbon (OC) were 1.0 +/- A 0.1 Tg C year(-1) (3.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)), with highest area-specific riverine export in western (4.5 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and lowest (1.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)) in subarctic Norway. In west and middle Norway, river OC export was approximately equal to carbon accumulation in soils and wetlands, while it was 50 % of soil and wetland carbon accumulation in southeast and subarctic Norway. Lateral aquatic transport of carbon is not explicitly accounted for in forest soil carbon accumulation estimates, although aquatic fluxes represent a climate-dependent carbon loss from soil carbon pools. The lack of methods that adequately account for lateral fluxes in carbon balances adds considerable uncertainty to soil carbon sink estimates. Climate warming and associated changes in precipitation may result in substantial alterations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes, with uncertain implications for the terrestrial carbon sink of northern landscapes.

AB 1. Changing temperature regimes and precipitation patterns in the Subarctic will impact on vegetation composition and diversity including those of bryophyte and lichen communities, which are major drivers of high-latitude carbon and nutrient cycling and hydrology.
   2. We investigated the relative importance of such impacts at different temporal, spatial and plant functional scales in subarctic Sphagnum fuscum-dominated peatlands, comprising both an in situ warming experiment and natural climatic and topographic gradients in northern Sweden and Norway. We applied multivariate analyses to investigate the relationships among cryptogam and vascular plant species composition and abiotic (temperature, moisture) and biotic (Sphagnum growth) regimes at various scales.
   3. At the short-term temporal scale (4-year warming experiment), increased temperature yielded no clear effect on cryptogam or vascular plant species composition. Spatially, direct effects of temperature were decisive for overall species composition across regions (macro-scale) rather than within one region (meso-scale). Moisture and Sphagnum growth were drivers of species composition at all spatial scales, and Sphagnum growth itself depended on its position on the microtopographic gradient and on temperature.
   4. Grouping of bryophytes and lichens at increasing scales of functional aggregation from species, growth form to the major higher taxon level (Sphagnum, other mosses, liverworts, lichens) revealed mostly increasing correlation with climate regimes and Sphagnum growth. Excluding liverworts from the analysis tended to reduce the correlation.
   5. Abundances of lichens, liverworts, non-Sphagnum mosses and (to a lesser degree) vascular plants were negatively related to Sphagnum abundance. Few cryptogam and vascular plant species showed a positive relationship with Sphagnum abundance. Correspondingly, cryptogam species richness and Shannon Index on peatlands strongly declined as Sphagnum abundance increased, while indices for vascular plants showed no significant relationship.
   6. Synthesis. Scale, be it spatial or functional, strongly determined which environmental drivers showed the clearest relationships with vegetation composition and diversity. Our findings will help to optimize predictions about long-term effects of climate on peatland vegetation composition, and subsequently its feedbacks to carbon and water cycles, at the regional scale.

AB Soil temperature regimes were studied in three ecosystems of the north of Western Siberia in the zone of isolated permafrost: the forest ecosystem with gleyic loamy sandy podzol (Stagnic Albic Podzol), the flat-topped peat mound ecosystem with humus-impregnated loamy sandy to light loamy peat cryozem (Histic Oxyaquic Turbic Cryosol (Arenic)), and the peat mound (palsa) ecosystem with oligotrophic destructive permafrost-affected peat soil (Cryic Histosol). Annual temperature measurements in the soil profiles demonstrated that these soils function under different temperature regimes: very cold permafrost regime and cold nonpermafrost regime. The following annual temperature characteristics proved to be informative for the studied soils: sums of above-zero temperatures at the depths of 10 and 20 cm, the maximum depth of penetration of temperatures above 10A degrees C, and the number of days with daily soil temperatures above (or below) 0A degrees C at the depth of 20 cm. On the studied territory, the insulating effect of the snow cover in winter was at least two times more pronounced than the insulating effect of the vegetation cover in summer. Cryogenic soils of the studied region are characterized by the high buffering towards changing climatic parameters. This is explained by the presence of the litter and peat horizons with a very low thermal diffusivity and by the presence of permafrost at a relatively shallow depth with temperature gradients preventing penetration of heat to the permafrost table.

AB Groundwater-fed calcareous wetlands (fens) support diverse plant assemblages including rare species and boreal disjuncts, yet factors structuring related microclimatic and plant community variation have not been thoroughly examined. We investigated factors influencing microclimate variation in temperate fens relative to uplands and examined associated plant compositional gradients within fens. Large differences in average soil temperatures were observed between monitoring locations during a 161 day period in 2010 (range: 14.5 to 20.0 A degrees C). Using a regression approach, we developed accurate daily resolution soil temperature models (min and max) from a 29-sensor network by integrating atmospheric and hydrologic terms. Models accurately predicted validation observations from an independent 17-sensor network (R-2 values 0.92 minimums; 0.95 maximums) with low error compared to null models. Environmental variation in seasonal average soil temperature, snow depth, specific conductance, canopy closure, and non-vascular plant cover were correlated with spatial patterns in vascular plant community composition. Results of plant community analyses provided insufficient support to suggest boreal and non-boreal species occupied distinct microsites. Given the significant soil temperature variation observed, we suggest further investigation of climatic factors structuring wetland plant communities are warranted to inform the placement of conservation reserves that may be less vulnerable to climate change.

We examined the sensitivity of key ESPs (cryoturbation, solifluction, nivation, and palsa mires) to changing climate by modeling their distribution in regard to climate, local topography, and soil variables in northern Fennoscandia. The distributions of ESPs were then forecasted under two future time periods, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099, using ensemble modeling and three emission scenarios. Increase of 2 degrees C in current temperature conditions caused an almost complete loss of ESPs, highlighting the extreme climatic sensitivity of high-latitude geomorphic processes. Forecasts based on three scenarios suggest a disappearance of suitable climate for studied ESPs by the end of this century. This could initiate multiple opposing feedback between land surface and atmosphere through changes in albedo, heat fluxes, and biogeochemical cycles.

AB Foliar litter is the main input of organic carbon to many soils, and thus litter decomposition processes are integral to our understanding of carbon dynamics in soil systems. Despite the short duration of the leaching phase of decomposition, a considerable amount of mass loss can occur providing a valuable energy source for microbes, and influencing leaf litter chemistry for subsequent microbial decomposition. At the same time, differences in plant species and their functional traits play a role in decomposition dynamics, particularly in consideration of shifting plant communities or changes in leaf chemistry under climate change. Here we investigate the short-term leaching decomposition dynamics of three boreal peatland plant species (Carex magellanica, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Sphagnum magellanicum) grown under ambient and elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. Litter chemistry was significantly different among all three plant species. In addition, plant tissues grown under elevated CO2 showed lower total C and total N than plants grown under ambient CO2. After leaching, however litter from plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions were not significantly different in total C values compared to plants grown under ambient CO2 conditions. Mass loss corresponded with the total dissolved organic carbon release across all species and was greatest in Chamaedaphne, a woody shrub; measures of carbon lability (SUVA(254)) were significantly greater in vascular plant species compared to Sphagnum moss. Mass loss was reduced in plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions, suggesting allocation to more non-soluble structural compounds. Placing our results within a climate change scenario where peatland plant community compositional shifts from mosses to graminoids and woody shrubs have been observed, we suggest that greater amounts of more labile carbon released from vascular plant species indicates a shift to more decomposable litters with the potential to stimulate microbial growth and activity.

AB Mires in boreal area had proved to be an important dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reserve for the sensitivity to climate change and human interfering. The study was focused on the temporal and spatial dynamics and controlling factors of DOC in a seasonally-waterlogged mire (SLM) and perennially-waterlogged mire (PLM) in the Sanjiang Plain, Northest China. In the two mires, DOC concentrations in both surface water and upper soil strata experienced pronounced seasonal variation. DOC concentrations in the surface waters were the greatest and averagely was 47.82 in SLM and 34.84 mg/L and PLM, whereas that in soil water at 0.3-m depth had little difference (20.25 mg/L in SLM and 26.51 mg/L in PLM). Results revealed that DOC concentrations declined 5-8 times vertically from the surface down to groundwater. DOC in the groundwater only was in a very small part with the average concentration of 5.18 mg/L. In relation to the surface water, DOC concentrations varied positively with temperature just before 8 August, and only in early spring and later autumn DOC concentrations exhibited identifiable spatial trends along with standing water depths in PLM. It was supposed that the influences from standing water depth took effect only in conditions of low temperature, and temperature should be the most powerful factor controlling DOC dynamics in the mires. Redox potential (Red) showed negative relationship with DOC values while total nitrogen (TN) and the majority of free ions in the soil solution exhibited no relationship. High soil TOC/TN ratio and low redox potentials also led to DOC accumulation in the mires in the Sanjiang Plain.

AB Substantial palsa degradation has occurred in Fennoscandia, which is considered to be driven by global climate change. Deeper understanding of the role of different climatic drivers on palsa decay, however, is lacking. We use meteorological data and aerial photographs from 1955 to 2016 to statistically identify the most important climatic drivers affecting changes in lateral-temporal palsa decay rates in the largest coherent palsa complex in Sweden, Vissatvuopmi. We show that wetter, warmer and shorter winters are the main causes of large and rapid changes in lateral-palsa extent since the mid-1950s. By analyzing meteorological data from the 1880s to present, we show that average annual temperature conditions have been unfavourable for palsas for more than a century and average annual precipitation conditions have been unfavourable since the 1940s. The decay rates have likely been amplified over the past 50-60 years, and in particular over the most recent decades, due to the combined effect of adverse air temperature and precipitation conditions. Palsa loss is expected to continue, most likely at a higher rate than today, with serious ecological impacts as a consequence.

SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS

DT Article

AB The stability of global soil carbon ( C) represents a major uncertainty in forecasting future climate change. In the UK, substantial soil C losses have been reported, while at the same time dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in upland waters have increased, suggesting that soil C stocks may be destabilising in response to climate change. To investigate the link between soil carbon and DOC at a range of sites, soil organic matter, soilwater and streamwater DOC were analysed for radiocarbon (C-14). DOC exported from C-rich landscapes appears younger than the soil C itself, much of it comprising C assimilated post-1950s. DOC from more intensively managed, C-poor soils is older, in some cases > 100 years. Results appear consistent with soil C destabilisation in farmed landscapes, but not in peatlands. Reported C losses may to a significant extent be explained by mechanisms other than climate change, e. g. recovery from acidification in peatlands, and agricultural intensification in managed systems.

AB With climate change, droughts may become more frequent in southern Ontario, which could release metals from peat and degrade downstream water quality. Monthly volume- weighted metal ( Al, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn) concentrations and fluxes in streams and bulk deposition at Plastic Lake were monitored over 20 months in 2002- 2003, during which there was a summer drought. Monthly concentrations in the outflow from the wetland ( PC1) were variable, with very high concentrations following the drought. With the exception of Pb, statistically significant models of metal concentrations with SO42- and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were developed, and these relationships were used to estimate monthly metal exports between 1980 and 2000. Model predictions for Cd and Zn in PC1 agreed well ( p < 0.001) with concentrations measured between 1989 and 1991. Model predictions suggesting peaks in metal concentrations are common in years with pronounced summer droughts. In contrast to ombrotrophic bogs, the PC1 wetland receives the majority of its metal input from the terrestrial catchment, and mass balance approximations indicate no substantial depletion of metal reserves in peat. Drought- induced metal peaks may persist for many decades, potentially contributing to the delayed recovery of surface waters at Plastic Lake, despite declining S deposition.

AB The late Holocene (from 3500 yr BP to present) in eastern North America is characterised by a marked rise of water levels in lakes and by the accumulation of numerous peat bogs. According to a number of researchers, this could be due to an increase in winter precipitations that would have resulted in large water volumes released by snowmelt, inducing groundwater recharge and rise of water bodies such as lakes and aquifers. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by stratigraphical studies of small alluvial fans in Quebec. Radiocarbon dates from four small alluvial fans in the Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspesie regions indicate that these fans have been formed in the last 3500 years, due to an increase in forest runoff associated with spring snowmelt.

AB Boreal wetland carbon cycling is vulnerable to climate change in part because hydrology and the extent of frozen ground have strong influences on plant and microbial functions. We examined the response of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) across an experimental manipulation of water table position (both raised and lowered water table treatments) in a boreal-rich fen in interior Alaska. DOC and TDN responses to water table manipulation exhibited an interaction with seasonal ice dynamics. We observed consistently higher DOC and TDN concentrations in the lowered water table treatment (71.7 +/- 6.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.3 mg(-L)) than in both the control (55.6 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 mg(-L)) and raised (49.1 +/- 4.3 and 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg L-1, respectively) water table treatments. Across all plots, pore water DOC concentrations at 20 cm increased as the depth to water table increased (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.001). DOC concentrations also increased as the seasonal thaw depth increased, with solutes increasing most rapidly in the drained plot (R-2 = 0.62, p < 0.001). About half of the TDN pool was composed of dissolved organic N (DON). Inorganic N and DON were both highly correlated with changes in DOC, and their respective constraints to mineralization are discussed. These results demonstrate that a declining water table position and dryer conditions affect thaw depth and peat temperatures, and interactions among these ecosystem properties will likely increase DOC and TDN loading and potential for export in these systems.

AB The future status of peatlands as carbon stores/sinks is uncertain given current and predicted environmental change. Several factors can affect the magnitude of the peatland carbon sink including disturbances such as wildfire. There is at present little evidence of how wildfire affects the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) via perturbation to aerobic and anaerobic respiration. The greatest effects, which are likely to vary according to wildfire severity, would be expected in the immediate post-fire stages when little recovery has taken place. Here, we investigate five UK peatland wildfires (2011-2012) in the immediate post-wildfire period measuring CO(2)and CH(4)fluxes using static chambers. Fire severity was described using a modified form of the composite burn index. A hierarchical partitioning approach indicated time since fire was the most strongly associated variable that fluxes of both CO2, and CH(4)followed by soil temperature for CO(2)and fire severity for CH4. Using a liner mixed modelling approach to account for repeated measures; fire severity was a significant term for CH(4)and borderline significant for CO2. Mean fluxes of CH(4)were consistently lower on burnt sites. In contrast, data from a fire in the north of Scotland appeared to show the opposite relationship for CH(4)with higher fluxes on the burnt sites. These results suggest that wildfire can affect gaseous carbon fluxes, but the responses can be variable in both space and time and that disruption to anaerobic processes may be site and/or fire dependent.

AB The ongoing expansion of shrub cover in response to climate change represents a unique opportunity to explore the link between soil microbial communities and vegetation changes. This link is particularly important in peatlands where shrub expansion is expected to feed back negatively on the carbon sink capacity of these ecosystems. Microbial community structure and function were measured seasonally in four peatlands located along an altitude gradient representing a natural gradient of climate and associated vascular plant abundance. We show that increased soil temperature and reduced water content are associated with greater vascular plant biomass, in particular that of ericoids, and that this, in turn, is correlated with greater microbial biomass. More specifically, microbial community structure is characterized by an increasing dominance of fungi over bacteria with improved soil oxygenation. We also found that the carbon and nitrogen stoichiometry of microbial biomass differs in relation to soil microbial community structure and that this is ultimately associated with a different investment in extracellular enzymatic activity. Our findings highlight the fact that the determination of the structural identity of microbial communities can help to explain the biogeochemical dynamics of organic matter and provide a better understanding of ecosystem response to environmental changes.

AB Ecosystems are increasingly prone to climate extremes, such as drought, with long-lasting effects on both plant and soil communities and, subsequently, on carbon (C) cycling. However, recent studies underlined the strong variability in ecosystem's response to droughts, raising the issue of nonlinear responses in plant and soil communities. The conundrum is what causes ecosystems to shift in response to drought. Here, we investigated the response of plant and soil fungi to drought of different intensities using a water table gradient in peatlands-a major C sink ecosystem. Using moving window structural equationmodels, we show that substantial changes in ecosystem respiration, plant and soil fungal communities occurred when the water level fell below a tipping point of -24cm. As a corollary, ecosystem respiration was the greatest when graminoids and saprotrophic fungi became prevalent as a response to the extreme drought. Graminoids indirectly influenced fungal functional composition and soil enzyme activities through their direct effect on dissolved organic matter quality, while saprotrophic fungi directly influenced soil enzyme activities. In turn, increasing enzyme activities promoted ecosystem respiration. We show that functional transitions in ecosystem respiration critically depend on the degree of response of graminoids and saprotrophic fungi to drought. Our results represent a major advance in understanding the nonlinear nature of ecosystem properties to drought and pave the way towards a truly mechanistic understanding of the effects of drought on ecosystem processes.

AB Wetlands play a key role in regional and global environments, and are critically linked to major issues such as climate change, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, water quality protection, and global carbon and methane cycles. Remotely-sensed imagery provides a means to detect and monitor wetlands on large scales and with regular frequency. In this project, methodologies were developed to classify wetlands (Open Bog, Treed Bog, Open Fen, Treed Fen, and Swamps) from multi-source remotely sensed data using advanced classification algorithms. The data utilized included multispectral optical and thermal data (Landsat-5) and Radar imagery from RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1. The goals were to determine the best way to combine the aforementioned imagery to classify wetlands, and determine the most significant image features. Classification algorithms investigated in this study were Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Based on the test results in the study area in Northern Ontario, Canada (49 degrees 31'.34N, 80 degrees 43'37.04W), a RF based classification methodology produced the most accurate classification result (87.51%). SVM, in some cases, produced results of comparable or better accuracy than RF. Our work also showed that the use of surface temperature (an untraditional feature choice) could aid in the classification process if the image is from an abnormally warm spring. This study found that wetlands were best classified using the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetative Index) calculated from optical imagery obtained in the spring months, radar backscatter coefficients, surface temperature, and ancillary data such as surface slope, computed through either an RF or SVM classifier. It was also found that preselection of features using Log-normal or RF variable importance analysis was an effective way of identifying low quality features and to a lesser extent features which were of higher quality.

AB Peatlands are important sinks for atmospheric carbon (C), yet the role of plant functional types (PFTs) for C sequestration under climatic perturbations is still unclear. A plant-removal experiment was used to study the importance of vascular PFTs for the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) during (i.e., resistance) and after (i.e., recovery) an experimental drought. The removal of PFTs caused a decrease of NEE, but the rate differed between microhabitats (i.e., hummocks and lawns) and the type of PFTs. Ericoid removal had a large effect on NEE in hummocks, while the graminoids played a major role in the lawns. The removal of PFTs did not affect the resistance or the recovery after the experimental drought. We argue that the response of Sphagnum mosses (the only PFT present in all treatments) to drought is dominant over that of coexisting PFTs. However, we observed that the moment in time when the system switched from C sink to C source during the drought was controlled by the vascular PFTs. In the light of climate change, the shifts in species composition or even the loss of certain PFTs are expected to strongly affect the future C dynamics in response to environmental stress.

AB Understanding the complex relationships among climate, tree growth, and water availability is key for predicting the performance of environmentally and economically salient tree species like Pinus banksiana Lamb. Ecologically, P. banksiana occupies the extreme habitats of soil moisture gradient, from very sandy dry soils to waterlogged bogs. However, little is known about how its growth may be affected by future climate in these two habitats. We assessed the effect of climatic variability on the growth of this species under different moisture conditions (sandy dry soils and bogs). Trees in the bog site had the highest growth rates. Individuals in all sites responded positively to increased spring temperature, whereas those in the bog site showed the highest response to increased summer moisture. However, in dry years, growth response in the bog site declined by 17%, whereas in the two drier sites, growth declined between 1% and 9.6%, equalizing growth rates across sites. Further, the decline in growth associated with drier summers eliminated the benefits of warmer springs at the bog site. Sites near bogs are currently associated with high growth performance and are commonly planted with this species. Yet, under the projected climate for the region, trees growing in these sites will likely lose their advantage.

AB In high-latitude regions, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions during the winter represent an important component of the annual ecosystem carbon budget; however, the mechanisms that control the winter CO2 emissions are currently not well understood. It has been suggested that substrate availability from soil labile carbon pools is a main driver of winter CO2 emissions. In ecosystems that are dominated by annual herbaceous plants, much of the biomass produced during the summer is likely to contribute to the soil labile carbon pool through litter fall and root senescence in the autumn. Thus, the summer carbon uptake in the ecosystem may have a significant influence on the subsequent winter CO2 emissions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a plot-scale shading experiment in a boreal peatland to reduce the gross primary production (GPP) during the growing season. At the growing season peak, vascular plant biomass in the shaded plots was half that in the control plots. During the subsequent winter, the mean CO2 emission rates were 21% lower in the shaded plots than in the control plots. In addition, long-term (2001-2012) eddy covariance data from the same site showed a strong correlation between the GPP (particularly the late summer and autumn GPP) and the subsequent winter net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). In contrast, abiotic factors during the winter could not explain the interannual variation in the cumulative winter NEE. Our study demonstrates the presence of a cross-seasonal link between the growing season biotic processes and winter CO2 emissions, which has important implications for predicting winter CO2 emission dynamics in response to future climate change.

AB The stable isotope compositions of moss tissue water (delta H-2 and delta O-18) and cellulose (delta C-13 and delta O-18), and testate amoebae populations were sampled from 61 contemporary surface samples along a 600-km latitudinal gradient of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) to provide a spatial record of environmental change. The isotopic composition of moss tissue water represented an annually integrated precipitation signal with the expected isotopic depletion with increasing latitude. There was a weak, but significant, relationship between cellulose delta O-18 and latitude, with predicted source water inputs isotopically enriched compared to measured precipitation. Cellulose delta C-13 values were dependent on moss species and water content, and may reflect site exposure to strong winds. Testate amoebae assemblages were characterised by low concentrations and taxonomic diversity, with Corythion dubium and Microcorycia radiata types the most cosmopolitan taxa. The similarity between the intra- and inter-site ranges measured in all proxies suggests that microclimate and micro-topographical conditions around the moss surface were important determinants of proxy values. Isotope and testate amoebae analyses have proven value as palaeoclimatic, temporal proxies of climate change, whereas this study demonstrates that variations in isotopic and amoeboid proxies between microsites can be beyond the bounds of the current spatial variability in AP climate.

AB To predict the role of ombrotrophic bogs as carbon sinks in the future, it is crucial to understand how Sphagnum vegetation in bogs will respond to global change. We performed a greenhouse experiment to study the effects of two temperature treatments (17.5 and 21.7A degrees C) and two N addition treatments (0 and 4 g N m(-2) year(-1)) on the growth of four Sphagnum species from three geographically interspersed regions: S. fuscum, S. balticum (northern and central Sweden), S. magellanicum and S. cuspidatum (southern Sweden). We studied the growth and cover change in four combinations of these Sphagnum species during two growing seasons. Sphagnum height increment and production were affected negatively by high temperature and high N addition. However, the northern species were more affected by temperature, while the southern species were more affected by N addition. High temperature depressed the cover of the 'wet' species, S. balticum and S. cuspidatum. Nitrogen concentrations increased with high N addition. N:P and N:K ratios indicated P-limited growth in all treatments and co-limitation of P and K in the high N treatments. In the second year of the experiment, several containers suffered from a severe fungal infection, particularly affecting the 'wet' species and the high N treatment. Our findings suggest that global change can have negative consequences for the production of Sphagnum species in bogs, with important implications for the carbon sequestration in these ecosystems.

AB Permafrost and varying land surface properties greatly complicate modelling of the thermal response of Arctic soils to climate change. The forest-tundra transition near Nadym in west Siberia provides an excellent study area in which to examine the contrasting thermal properties of soils in a forested ecosystem without permafrost and peatlands with permafrost. We investigated the effects of forest shading, snow cover and variable organic soil horizons in three common ecosystems of the forest-tundra transition zone. Based on the year-round temperature profile data, the most informative annual parameters were: (1) the sum of positive average daily temperatures at depths of 10 and 20cm; (2) the maximum penetration depth of temperatures above 10 degrees C; and (3) the number of days with temperatures below 0 degrees C at a depth of 20cm. The insulative effect of snow cover in winter was at least twice that of the shading and cooling effect of vegetation in summer. In areas with shallow permafrost, the presence of a thick organic horizon, with an extremely low thermal diffusivity, creates a very steep temperature gradient that limits heat penetration to the top of the permafrost in summer.

AB Changing climate is predicted to impact all depths of the global oceans, yet projections of range shifts in marine faunal distributions in response to changing climate seldom evaluate potential shifts in depth distribution. Marine ectotherms' thermal tolerance is limited by their ability to maintain aerobic metabolism (oxygen- and capacity-limited tolerance), and is functionally associated with their hypoxia tolerance. Shallow-water (<200m depth) marine invertebrates and fishes demonstrate limited tolerance of increasing hydrostatic pressure (pressure exerted by the overlying mass of water), and hyperbaric (increased pressure) tolerance is proposed to depend on the ability to maintain aerobic metabolism, too. Here, we report significant correlation between the hypoxia thresholds and the hyperbaric thresholds of taxonomic groups of shallow-water fauna, suggesting that pressure tolerance is indeed oxygen limited. Consequently, it appears that the combined effects of temperature, pressure and oxygen concentration constrain the fundamental ecological niches (FENs) of marine invertebrates and fishes. Including depth in a conceptual model of oxygen- and capacity-limited FENs' responses to ocean warming and deoxygenation confirms previous predictions made based solely on consideration of the latitudinal effects of ocean warming (e.g. Cheung etal., 2009), that polar taxa are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, with Arctic fauna experiencing the greatest FEN contraction. In contrast, the inclusion of depth in the conceptual model reveals for the first time that temperate fauna as well as tropical fauna may experience substantial FEN expansion with ocean warming and deoxygenation, rather than FEN maintenance or contraction suggested by solely considering latitudinal range shifts.

AB Litter decomposition and nutrient mineralization in high-latitude peatlands are constrained by low temperatures. So far, little is known about the effects of seasonal components of climate change (higher spring and summer temperatures, more snow which leads to higher winter soil temperatures) on these processes. In a 4-year field experiment, we manipulated these seasonal components in a sub-arctic bog and studied the effects on the decomposition and N and P dynamics of leaf litter of Calamagrostis lapponica, Betula nana, and Rubus chamaemorus, incubated both in a common ambient environment and in the treatment plots. Mass loss in the controls increased in the order Calamagrostis < Betula < Rubus. After 4 years, overall mass loss in the climate-treatment plots was 10 % higher compared to the ambient incubation environment. Litter chemistry showed within each incubation environment only a few and species-specific responses. Compared to the interspecific differences, they resulted in only moderate climate treatment effects on mass loss and these differed among seasons and species. Neither N nor P mineralization in the litter were affected by the incubation environment. Remarkably, for all species, no net N mineralization had occurred in any of the treatments during 4 years. Species differed in P-release patterns, and summer warming strongly stimulated P release for all species. Thus, moderate changes in summer temperatures and/or winter snow addition have limited effects on litter decomposition rates and N dynamics, but summer warming does stimulate litter P release. As a result, N-limitation of plant growth in this sub-arctic bog may be sustained or even further promoted.

AB There is emerging concern over the impact of extreme events such as heavy rainfall on the quality of water entering the drinking water supply from aboveground sources, as such events are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency in response to climate change. We compared the impact of rainfall events on streamwater quality in four contrasting upland (peatland and mineral soil) and lowland agricultural catchments used to supply drinking water in France (Brittany) and the United Kingdom (North Wales) by analyzing water samples collected before, during, and after specific events. At all four streams, heavy rainfall led to a considerable rise in organic matter concentration ranging from 48 to 158%. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quality, as determined using specific ultraviolet absorbance, changed consistently at all sites during rainfall events, with a greater proportion of aromatic and higher molecular weight compounds following the onset of rainfall. However, the change in DOC quality and quantity did not significantly alter the trihalomethane formation potential. We observed small increases in trihalomethane (THM) generation only at the Welsh peatland and agricultural sites and a small decrease at the Brittany agricultural site. The proportion of brominated THMs in chlorinated waters was positively correlated with bromide/DOC ratio in raw waters for all sites and hydrological conditions. These results provide a first indication of the potential implications for surface-based drinking water resources resulting from expected future increases in rainfall event intensity and extension of dry periods with climate changes.

AB Thawing permafrost and the resulting microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon (C) is one of the most significant potential feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a changing climate. In this article we present an overview of the global permafrost C pool and of the processes that might transfer this C into the atmosphere, as well as the associated ecosystem changes that occur with thawing. We show that accounting for C stored deep in the permafrost more than doubles previous high-latitude inventory estimates, with this new estimate equivalent to twice the atmospheric C pool. The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastrophically exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be altered by climate change along with thawing permafrost, such as growing season length, plant growth rates and species composition, and ecosystem energy exchange. However, these processes do not appear to be able to compensate for C release from thawing permafrost, making it likely that the net effect of widespread permafrost thawing will be a positive feedback to a warming climate.

AB Sphagnum peatlands represent a globally significant pool and sink of carbon but these functions are threatened by ongoing climate change. Testate amoebae are useful bioindicators of hydrological changes, but little experimental work has been done on the impact of water table changes on communities.
   Using a mesocosm experimental setting that was previously used to assess the impact of drought disturbance on communities and ecosystem processes with three contrasted water table positions: wet (-4 cm), intermediate (-15 cm) and dry (-25 cm), we studied the capacity of testate amoeba communities to recover when the water table was kept at -10 cm for all plots. The overall experiment lasted three years. We assessed the taxonomic and functional trait responses of testate amoeba communities. The selected traits were hypothesised to be correlated to moisture content (response traits: shell size, aperture position) or trophic role (effect traits: mixotrophy, aperture size controlling prey range).
   During the disturbance phase, the mixotrophic species Hyalosphenia papilio dominated the wet and intermediate plots, while the community shifted to a dominance of "dry indicators" (Corythion dubium, Nebela tincta, Cryptodifflugia oviformis) and corresponding traits (loss of mixotrophy, and dominance of smaller taxa with ventral or ventral-central aperture) in dry plots. During the recovery phase we observed two contrasted trends in the previously wet and intermediate plots: communities remained similar where the Sphagnum carpet remained intact but species and traits indicators of drier conditions increased in plots where it had degraded. In the former dry plots, indicators and traits of wet conditions increased by the end of the experiment.
   This is one of the first experiment simulating a disturbance and subsequent recovery in ex-situ mesocosms of Sphagnum peatland focusing on the response of testate amoebae community structure as well as functional traits to water table manipulation. The results generally confirmed that testate amoebae respond within a few months to hydrological changes and thus represent useful bioindicators for assessing current and past hydrological changes in Sphagnum peatlands.

AB We present a decadal (1994-2004) record of carbon dioxide flux in a 160-year-old black spruce forest/veneer bog complex in central Manitoba, Canada. The ecosystem shifted from a source (+41 g C m(-2), 1995) to a sink (-21 g C m(-2), 2004) of CO2 over the decade, with an average net carbon balance near zero. Annual mean temperatures increased 1-2 degrees during the period, consistent with the decadal trend across the North American boreal biome. We found that ecosystem carbon exchange responded strongly to air temperature, moisture status, potential evapotranspiration, and summertime solar radiation. The seasonal cycle of ecosystem respiration significantly lagged that of photosynthesis, limited by the rate of soil thaw and the slow drainage of the soil column. Factors acting over long time scales, especially water table depth, strongly influenced the carbon budget on annual time scales. Net uptake was enhanced and respiration inhibited by multiple years of rainfall in excess of evaporative demand. Contrary to expectations, we observed no correlation between longer growing seasons and net uptake, possibly because of offsetting increases in ecosystem respiration. The results indicate that the interactions between soil thaw and water table depth provide critical controls on carbon exchange in boreal forests underlain by peat, on seasonal to decadal time scales, and these factors must be simulated in terrestrial biosphere models to predict response of these regions to future climate.

AB We measured year-round landscape-scale methane (CH4) flux in a boreal bog from May 2014 to April 2016 using the eddy covariance technique. The objectives of the study were to investigate the controls on CH4 flux at different periods of the growing season and to quantify the annual CH4 flux budget. The daily average growing season water table (WT) ranged from -0.33 to - 0.08 m in 2014 and from -0.36 to - 0.08 m in 2015. Strong seasonal variability in the daily average CH4 fluxes was observed in both 2014 and 2015, ranging from near zero before May to a peak of above 20 nmol m(-2) s(-1) in the middle-late August in 2014 and in the early-middle September in 2015. Soil temperature at 50 cm and water table exerted interactive impact on the seasonal variation in the daily average growing season CH4 flux in both years. Soil temperature at 1 cm was negatively related to CH4 flux when water table dropped more than 0.25 m below the peat surface in 2015 growing season, suggesting that the seasonal variation in CH4 flux was dominated by the variation due to CH 4 oxidation. During the non-growing season, the daily variation in CH4 fluxes was mostly related to friction velocity in both years. In addition, daily average CH4 flux was linearly related to net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) when daily NEE was negative (Le., days with CO2 uptake larger than ecosystem respiration), but there was no correlation between them when NEE was positive (days with ecosystem respiration dominated over CO2 uptake) during the growing season. We found that this boreal bog acted as a small CH4 source of 3.7 +/- 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) from May 2014 to April 2015 and 3.1 +/- 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) from May 2015 to April 2016. These values were at the lower end of the range of CH4 emission rates reported for boreal peatlands. Non-growing season CH4 emissions accounted for 41% (the first study year) and 39% (the second study year) of the annual emissions, highlighting the importance of non-growing season CH4 emissions in estimating the annual CH4 budget and the feedback to climate.

AB As a toxic and harmful global pollutant, mercury enters the environment through natural sources, and human activities. Based on large numbers of previous studies, this paper summarized the characteristics of mercury deposition and the impacts of climate change and human activities on mercury deposition from a global perspective. The results indicated that global mercury deposition changed synchronously, with more accumulation during the glacial period and less accumulation during the interglacial period. Mercury deposition fluctuated greatly during the Early Holocene but was stable and low during the Mid-Holocene. During the Late Holocene, mercury deposition reached the highest value. An increase in precipitation promotes a rise in forest litterfall Hg deposition. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research on the mechanisms of mercury deposition affected by long-term humidity changes. Mercury accumulation was relatively low before the Industrial Revolution ca. 1840, while after industrialization, intensive industrial activities produced large amounts of anthropogenic mercury emissions and the accumulation increased rapidly. Since the 1970s, the center of global mercury production has gradually shifted from Europe and North America to Asia. On the scale of hundreds of thousands of years, mercury accumulation was greater in cold periods and less in warm periods, reflecting exogenous dust inputs. On millennial timescales, the correspondence between mercury deposition and temperature is less significant, as the former is more closely related to volcanic eruption and human activities. However, there remains significant uncertainties such as non-uniform distribution of research sites, lack of mercury deposition reconstruction with a long timescale and sub-century resolution, and the unclear relationship between precipitation change and mercury accumulation.

AB This study analyses long-term water quality data from an upland peat catchment in order to understand long-term changes in hydrological flowpaths and how they relate to recovery from severe drought and control the release of DOC. The study examined comparative records from rainfall, soil and stream samples over a 9-year period, which included an approximately I in 30-year drought 2 years into the period. The study examined single tracers and utilised multivariate statistics to examine changing sources and routes of runoff. The study shows that the severe drought is part of dry period not restricted to a single summer and this extended dry period may give rise to the extent of the chemical changes observed in the stream chemistry. During this period of drought there is no evidence for substantive new flowpaths being generated during the drought, instead the residence time of the water in the upper peat horizon (< 10 cm depth) increases and that this increase is reflected in the chemistry of runoff. The soil waters deeper in the peat profile (approx. 50 cm) show increased influence of rainwater compositions and that during drought the residence times at depth increase. There is an offset between the severe drought and maximums in concentrations of Fe, DOC and Al are related to the hydrophobic nature of the peat matrix. The effects of a 30-year drought persisted for no more than 3 years ending with the end of the dry period, and at least the effects of severe drought lasted only a year. The study suggests that in peat catchments summer's are hydrologically independent of the winters and this fact limits the consequences of severe drought. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Streams draining upland catchments carry large quantities of carbon from terrestrial stocks to downstream freshwater and marine ecosystems. Here it either enters long-term storage in sediments or enters the atmosphere as gaseous carbon through a combination of biotic and abiotic processes. There are, however, increasing concerns over the long-term stability of terrestrial carbon stores in blanket peatland catchments as a result of anthropogenic pressures and climate change. We analysed sub-annual and interannual changes in river water colour (a reliable proxy measurement of dissolved organic carbon; DOC) using 6 years of weekly data, from 2011 to 2016. This time-series dataset was gathered from three contiguous river sub-catchments, the Black, the Glenamong and the Srahrevagh, in a blanket peatland catchment system in western Ireland, and it was used to identify the drivers that best explained observed temporal change in river colour. The data were also used to estimate annual DOC loads from each catchment. General additive mixed modelling was used to identify the principle environmental drivers of water colour in the rivers, while wavelet cross-correlation analysis was used to identify common frequencies in correlations. At 130 mg Pt Co L-1, the mean colour levels in the Srahrevagh (the sub-catchment with lowest rainfall and higher forest cover) were almost 50% higher than those from the Black and Glenamong, at 95 and 84 mg Pt Co L-1 respectively. The decomposition of the colour datasets revealed similar multi-annual, annual and event-based (random component) trends, illustrating that environmental drivers operated synchronously at each of these temporal scales. For both the Black and its nested Srahrevagh catchment, three variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit, SMD, and the weekly North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) combined to explain 54% and 58% of the deviance in colour respectively. In the Glenamong, which had steeper topography and a higher percentage of peat intersected by streams, soil temperature, the log of stream discharge and the NAO explained 66% of the colour concentrations. Crosswavelet time-series analysis between river colour and each environmental driver revealed a significant high common power relationship at an annual time step. Each relationship however, varied in phase, further highlighting the complexity of the mechanisms driving river colour in the subcatchments. The estimated mean annual DOC loads for the Black and Glenamong rivers to Lough Feeagh were similar at 15.0 and 14.7 t C km(-2) yr(-1) respectively. The important role of past and current precipitation and, in particular, temperature emphasises the vulnerability of blanket peatland carbon stores to projected climate change and highlights the interaction of local and regional climate in controlling aquatic carbon export. Our results show that water colour (and hence DOC) concentrations can vary considerably between neighbouring catchments and also that regional-scale climatic drivers control the trends in intra-and inter-annual flux of DOC through the system. The combination of locally determined concentrations and regionally controlled fluxes produces aquatic DOC loads that vary over both the annual cycle and over multiple years.

AB Wetlands represent sources or sinks of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). The acidic fen Schloppnerbrunnen emits denitrification derived N2O and is also capable of N2O consumption. Global warming is predicted to cause more extreme weather events in future years, including prolonged drought periods as well as heavy rainfall events, which may result in flooding. Thus, the effects of prolonged drought and flooding events on the abundance, community composition, and activity of fen denitrifiers were investigated in manipulation experiments. The water table in the fen was experimentally lowered for 8 weeks in 2008 and raised for 5.5 months in 2009 on three treatment plots, while three plots were left untreated and served as controls. In situ N2O fluxes were rather unaffected by the drought treatment and were marginally increased by the flooding treatment. Samples were taken before and after treatment in both years. The structural gene markers narG and nosZ were used to assess possible changes in the nitrate reducer and denitrifier community in response to water table manipulations. Detected copy numbers of narG and nosZ were essentially unaffected by the experimental drought and flooding. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) patterns of narG and nosZ were similar before and after experimental drought or experimental flooding, indicating a stable nitrate reducer and denitrifier community in the fen. However, certain TRFs of narG and nosZ transcripts responded to experimental drought or flooding. Nitrate-dependent Michaelis-Menten kinetics were assessed in anoxic microcosms with peat samples taken before and 6 months after the onset of experimental flooding. Maximal reaction velocities vmax were higher after than before flooding in samples from treament but not in those from control plots taken at the same time. The ratio of N2O to N2O + N-2 was lower in soil from treatment plots after flooding than in soil from control plots, suggesting mitigation of N2O emissions by increased N2O-reduction rates after flooding. N2O was consumed to subatmospheric levels in all microcosms after flooding. The collective data indicate that water table manipulations had only minor effects on in situ N2O fluxes, denitrifier abundance, and denitrifier community composition of the acidic fen, while active subpopulations of denitrifiers changed in response to water table manipulations, suggesting functionally redundant subpopulations occupying distinct ecological niches in the fen.

AB The potential for wetland emissions to feedback on climate change has been previously hypothesised [Houghton et al., 2001]. We assess this hypothesis using an interactive wetlands scheme radiatively coupled to an integrated climate change effects model. The scheme predicts wetland area and methane (CH4) emissions from soil temperature and water table depth, and is constrained by optimising its ability to reproduce the observed inter-annual variability in atmospheric CH4. In transient climate change simulations the wetland response amplifies the total anthropogenic radiative forcing at 2100 by about 3.5 - 5%. The modelled increase in global CH4 flux from wetland is comparable to the projected increase in anthropogenic CH4 emissions over the 21st century under the IS92a scenario.

AB The global increase in surface air temperature has produced an overall lengthening of the growing season by 3-5 days/decade in the Northern Hemisphere during the last 30 years. The direct impact of a longer growing season has not been well documented for Sphagnum moss communities in the Arctic. We hypothesized that an increase in the growing season length may be detrimental to Sphagnum growth as a result of photoinhibition caused by the plants emerging from snow near the seasonal peak of solar irradiance. We conducted an experiment from 1999 to 2002, lengthening the growing season in arctic Alaska, to determine the effects that this simulation of climate change had on the growth of hollows dominated by Sphagnum angustifolium. The lengthened growing season was associated with a decrease in annual moss height increment of 78 and 69 % for 1999 and 2000, respectively. These growth reductions may be related to freeze/thaw episodes and prolonged periods of cold in those years. The growth of individuals exposed to snow removal was also reduced by high global radiation. Overall, snow removal did not significantly affect the seasonal dynamics of growth, but seasonal patterns of growth strongly differed among years. These differences in seasonal dynamics suggest that Sphagnum growth is driven by opportunistic responses to favorable conditions rather than ontogenetic drivers. In addition, we compared environmental variation and growth between control and snow removal plots. Growth of Sphagnum in both treatments was stimulated by warmer soil temperatures and drier conditions. With earlier snowmelt as a result of warmer temperatures, it is likely that S. angustifolium will be subjected to higher levels of radiation and possibly greater photoinhibition which may lead to lower growth rates and significant implications for moss production in tussock tundra.

AB In the sporadic permafrost zone of northwestern Canada, boreal forest carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes will be altered directly by climate change through changing meteorological forcing and indirectly through changes in landscape functioning associated with thaw-induced collapse-scar bog (` wetland') expansion. However, their combined effect on landscape-scale net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEELAND), resulting from changing gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), remains unknown. Here, we quantify indirect land cover change impacts on NEELAND and direct climate change impacts on modeled temperature-and light-limited NEELAND of a boreal forestwetland landscape. Using nested eddy covariance flux towers, we find both GPP and ER to be larger at the landscape compared to the wetland level. However, annual NEELAND (-20 g C m(-2)) and wetland NEE (-24 g C m(-2)) were similar, suggesting negligible wetland expansion effects on NEELAND. In contrast, we find non-negligible direct climate change impacts when modeling NEELAND using projected air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation. At the end of the 21st century, modeled GPP mainly increases in spring and fall due to reduced temperature limitation, but becomes more frequently light-limited in fall. In a warmer climate, ER increases year-round in the absence of moisture stress resulting in net CO2 uptake increases in the shoulder seasons and decreases during the summer. Annually, landscape net CO2 uptake is projected to decline by 25 +/- 14 g C m(-2) for a moderate and 103 +/- 38 g C m(-2) for a high warming scenario, potentially reversing recently observed positive net CO2 uptake trends across the boreal biome. Thus, even without moisture stress, net CO2 uptake of boreal forest-wetland landscapes may decline, and ultimately, these landscapes may turn into net CO2 sources under continued anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We conclude that NEELAND changes are more likely to be driven by direct climate change rather than by indirect land cover change impacts.

AB Purpose The quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) in the wetlands and peatlands are important for evaluating of the effects of environmental changes. This study's aim was to evaluate the change in the chemical properties of SOM and dissolved organic matter (DOM) during a constant temperature incubation of high-moor peat soil under two types of vegetation. Materials and methods Incubation of high-moor peat soils collected from marsh vegetation and dwarf bamboo was conducted for 108 days at each temperature of 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The chemical properties of alkaline extract and DOM in soil samples during incubation were analyzed by tetramethylammonium hydroxide thermochemolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TMAH-GC/MS) and fluorescence analysis. Results and discussion The cumulative CO2 emission from peat under dwarf bamboo was higher than that of peat under marsh vegetation. During incubation at 35 degrees C, plant and microbial residues in DOM extracted from dwarf bamboo soil were increased significantly at the early stages of culture. On the other hand, the components of DOM in the marsh vegetation soil sample did not significantly change between incubation at each temperature. The fluorescence spectra showed that protein-like fluorescent DOM contained in dwarf bamboo soil is consumed by microorganisms, which promotes leaching of humic-like fluorescent DOM and carbon mineralization during the incubation period at a higher temperature. Conclusions Compared with marsh vegetation soil, the DOM in dwarf bamboo soil is susceptible to temperature rises and can be a larger source of CO2 emissions. This study shows that evaluation of DOM properties in soil could be useful to assess the effect of climate change on soil environment.

AB Estimating carbon sequestration and nutrient accumulation rates in Northeast China are important to assess wetlands function as carbon sink buffering greenhouse gas increasing in North Asia. The objectives of this study were to estimate accreting rates of carbon and nutrients in typical temperate wetlands. Results indicated that average soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) contents were 37.81%, 1.59% and 0.08% in peatlands, 5.33%, 0.25% and 0.05% in marshes, 2.92%, 0.27% and 0.10% in marshy meadows, respectively. Chronologies reconstructed by Pb-210 in the present work were acceptable and reliable, and the average time to yield 0-40 cm depth sediment cores was 150 years. Average carbon sequestration rate (Carbon(sq)), nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation rates were 219.4 g C/(m(2).yr), 9.16 g N/(m(2).yr) and 0.46 g P/(m(2).yr) for peatland; 57.13 g C/(m(2).yr), 5.42 g N/(m(2).yr) and 2.16 g P/(m(2).yr) for marshy meadow; 78.35 g C/(m(2).yr), 8.70 g N/(m(2).yr) and 0.71 g P/(m(2).yr) for marshy; respectively. Positive relations existed between Carbon(sq) with nitrogen and precipitations, indicating that Carbon(sq) might be strengthened in future climate scenarios.

AB To estimate the magnitude of climate change anticipated for Canada's 38 National Parks (NPs) and Park Reserves, seasonal temperature and precipitation scenarios were constructed for 2050 and 2090 using the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) coupled model (CGCM1). For each park, we assessed impacts on physical systems, species, ecosystems and people. Important, widespread changes relate to marine and freshwater hydrology, glacial balance, waning permafrost, increased natural disturbance, shorter ice season, northern and upward altitudinal species and biome shifts, and changed visitation patterns. Other changes are regional (e.g., combined East coast subsidence and sea level rise increase coastal erosion and deposition, whereas, on the Pacific coast, tectonic uplift negates sea level rise). Further predictions concern individual parks (e.g., Unique fens of Bruce Peninsular NP will migrate lakewards with lowered water levels, but structural regulation of Lake Huron for navigation and power generation would destroy the fens). Knowledge gaps are the most important findings. For example: we could not form conclusions about glacial mass balance, or its effects on rivers and fjords. Likewise, for the East Coast Labrador Current we could neither estimate temperature and salinity effects of extra iceberg formation, nor the further effects on marine food chains, and breeding park seabirds. We recommend 1) Research on specific large knowledge gaps; 2) Climate change information exchange with protected area agencies in other northern countries; and 3) incorporating climate uncertainty into park plans and management. We discuss options for a new park management philosophy in the face of massive change and uncertainty.

AB Although it is known that cool fire can result in carbon loss in organic soils, data are lacking on the effects of such fire on the distinctive lowland organic soils of the southern hemisphere and on the relationship of fire-induced carbon loss to topography. We established an experiment to determine the effects of a low severity burn on organic and total mass of soils, the position of the water table and vegetation cover. We recorded soil losses directly after the fire, after the first rain and after 4 years. We also recorded losses as a result of the first rain and at 4 years after a wildfire at another locality with the same vegetation and topography. We compared soil surface temperatures over summer between burned and unburned moorland. The planned fire resulted in substantial soil and carbon losses, which, up to 4 years after the wildfire, occurred mostly as a result of the fire itself and the first rains. The topographic wetness index was strongly related to soil and organic matter loss for the pooled data for both sites, while fire severity, slope and vegetation cover were less predictive. Burning increased dissolved organic material in streams; the depth of the water table; and, soil temperatures. The continuing soil loss on slopes 18 years after fire contrasts with faster recovery on the shelves and in the basins, reflecting a strong topographic component in variation. Fire is a major influence on the depth of the organic soils of the southern hemisphere, as in the northern hemisphere. The influence of fire on soils varies markedly between topographic positions, with the time interval between fires that would maintain organic soils in basins being markedly less than that necessary to maintain organic soils on slopes. The topographic effect appears to be a consequence of relative drying rather than relative exposure to water or aeolian erosion or differences in fire severity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mixotrophic protists are increasingly recognized for their significant contribution to carbon (C) cycling. As phototrophs they contribute to photosynthetic C fixation, whilst as predators of decomposers, they indirectly influence organic matter decomposition. Despite these direct and indirect effects on the C cycle, little is known about the responses of peatland mixotrophs to climate change and the potential consequences for the peatland C cycle. With a combination of field and microcosm experiments, we show that mixotrophs in the Sphagnum bryosphere play an important role in modulating peatland C cycle responses to experimental warming. We found that five years of consecutive summer warming with peaks of +2 to +8 degrees C led to a 50% reduction in the biomass of the dominant mixotrophs, the mixotrophic testate amoebae (MTA). The biomass of other microbial groups (including decomposers) did not change, suggesting MTA to be particularly sensitive to temperature. In a microcosm experiment under controlled conditions, we then manipulated the abundance of MTA, and showed that the reported 50% reduction of MTA biomass in the field was linked to a significant reduction of net C uptake (-13%) of the entire Sphagnum bryosphere. Our findings suggest that reduced abundance of MTA with climate warming could lead to reduced peatland C fixation.

AB Pollen and spore analysis and analysis of carbon stable isotope composition in a peat core from Hala Izerska (SW Poland) were used for palaeoclimate studies of the Holocene over the last similar to 8.5 ka. The results of these two methods have been compared and variations of the delta C-13 value show a clear relationship with the pollen percentages of tree taxa, such as Carpinus, Fagus, Picea, and Anus as well as with spores of Sphagnum and akinetes of Cyanophyta. However, lags of up to similar to 200 years of pollen maxima and minima versus delta C-13 were observed. The delta C-13 value in the peat core varied between -23.47 and -27.58%. and is interpreted here as reflecting temperature control of the carbon isotope composition of the peat. According to this interpretation and pollen analysis of the study area, the following climatic periods for the Holocene can be described: Atlantic-beginning warm (8.50-7.90 ka cal. BP) followed by moderated cold (7.90-5.75 ka cal. BP), Subboreal-beginning moderated cold (5.75-5.40 ka cal. BP) then warm (5.40-2.55 ka cal. BP), Subatlantic-beginning warm (2.55-2.20 ka cal. BP) then cold and moderate cold (2.20 ka-0.40 ka cal. BP) with a climatic minimum similar to 1.60 ka cal. BP. The highest relative difference between growing season temperatures was about 3.6 degrees C, which has been observed between the Subboreal temperature maximum (5.00 ka cal. BP) and the Subatlantic temperature minimum (1.60 ka cal. BP). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. The breeding success of Finnish grouse has been in decline for decades. While it has been shown that fragmentation and modern forestry practices such as clear-cutting affect the viability of grouse populations, little is known about effects of large-scale drainage. The drainage network in Finland has increased dramatically during the past decades. By 1988, 6 million ha of bog ecosystems had been drained. This is likely to have had a profound direct and indirect effects on grouse productivity. Because ditches persist in time, large-scale drainage may therefore have strong potential for affecting the long-term breeding success of three forest grouse species in Finland.
   2. Using a mixed-model approach on nation-wide data, we estimate the effects of drainage on breeding success of three grouse species for the period from 1966 to 1988. The possible additive effect of precipitation is investigated using regional precipitation data. For each species, we compare a set of hypotheses and select the best model(s) according to the Akaike information criterion.
   3. For all species, the model which included the main effects of both ditch density and precipitation outperformed the models with just one of the main effects as well as the interaction model. The effects are restricted to southern and central Finland, where drainage is most intensive.
   4. The effects of drainage are likely to be both direct and indirect, but the mechanisms are less clear. Both bottom-up, such as decreased availability of insect food, and top-down effects, such as increased predation risk, may account for indirect effects. Direct effects are likely to involve drowning of chicks.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Bogs are classified as key biotopes by the European Union, and Finland is obliged to maintain their favourable conservation status and to protect typical bog communities. While this goal may be achieved for state-owned land, restoration of drainage systems on private land continues. Considering the persistence of ditches, new legislation are therefore needed to favour the recovery of former bogs and mires on private land as well as to protect remaining ones.

AB We examined rates of C, N, and P mineralization in soils from 16 northern Minnesota wetlands that occur across an ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient. Soils were incubated at 30 degrees C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 59 wk, and the results were fit with a two-pool kinetic model. Additionally, 39 different soil quality variables were used in a principal components analysis (PCA) to predict mineralization rates.
   Mineralization of C, N, and P differed significantly among wetland types, aeration status (aerobic vs. anaerobic), and their interaction term. Despite low total soil N and P, there was a rapid turnover of the nutrient pools in ombrotrophic sites, particularly under aerobic conditions. On a volumetric basis, C and N mineralization increased in a predictable manner across the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient, largely due to increasing soil bulk density. However, P mineralization per cubic centimeter remained relatively high in the bogs. The higher total P content of more minerotrophic soils appears to be offset by greater P immobilization due to geochemical sorption, yielding overall lower availability.
   Total C turnover rates were relatively similar among sites, despite large differences in soil quality. We suggest that, over time, the decay rates of organic matter in different wetland communities converge to a common rate. In contrast, CH(4) production was extremely low in ombrotrophic pests.
   The apparent labile pools of N (N(0)), P (P(0)), and C (C(0)) were generally <10% of their respective total pool sizes, except for P(0) in the bogs, which constituted up to 33% of total soil P. From 10% to 87% of the N, P, and C mineralized after 59 wk was derived from their respective labile pools.
   A simple group of variables describing the physical degree of decomposition of organic matter was often as good as, or superior to, more complicated chemical analyses in predicting C, N, and P mineralization. Because pears are classified and mapped according to these variables, it should make scaling efforts in landscape analyses much more tractable.
   Large differences in mineralization rates in northern wetland communities demonstrate that climate change models should not consider these areas as homogeneous entities. Our C mineralization results suggest that soil respiratory response to climate change (as CO(2) and CH(4)) will vary considerably in different wetland communities. Our results also suggest that the common perception that more ombrotrophic sites are inherently more nutrient deficient needs to be reassessed.

AB Changes in the distribution of palsas in Sweden's most southerly major palsa bog are outlined from 1960 to 1997 using aerial photographs taken in 1960 and 1976 as well as a study reported in a publication from 1967 and fieldwork in 1996 and 1997. The geomorphological changes are compared with changes in temperature and precipitation. Between 1960 and 1997, there was a decrease of c. 50% in the area of palsas and no new palsas seem to have developed during the period. Temporary new frost mounds developed during a winter with low snow cover (1995-96) but had disappeared again at the start of the field season of 1997. From open sections in selected palsas, samples were selected at levels of vegetational change indicating stages in palsa development. Radiocarbon dates of 95 +/- 65 a BP and 105 +/- 65 a BP give ages for the start of growth of palsas and a date of 390 +/- 70 a np may represent the last active phase of a previous palsa. The results suggest that some presently existing but decaying palsas started their growth possibly as late as during the last part of the Little lee Age. It is suggested that the present decay of palsas could be the result of the 1-1.5 degrees C increase in mean annual temperature in northern Sweden during the last c. 100 years, in particular since the 1930s, probably in combination with increased snowfall since c. 1930.

AB The vast boreal biome plays an important role in the global carbon cycle but is experiencing particularly rapid climate warming, threatening the integrity of valued ecosystems and their component species. We developed a framework and taxonomy to identify climate-change refugia potential in the North American boreal region, summarizing current knowledge regarding mechanisms, geographic distribution, and landscape indicators. While "terrain-mediated" refugia will mostly be limited to coastal and mountain regions, the ecological inertia (resistance to external fluctuations) contained in some boreal ecosystems may provide more extensive buffering against climate change, resulting in "ecosystem-protected" refugia. A notable example is boreal peatlands, which can retain high surface soil moisture and water tables even in the face of drought. Refugia from wildfire are also especially important in the boreal region, which is characterized by active disturbance regimes. Our framework will help identify areas of high refugia potential, and inform ecosystem management and conservation planning in light of climate change.

AB In the oil sands mining region near Fort McMurray, Alberta, strategies to construct wetlands and peatlands and methods to evaluate their success are just beginning. Reclamation of wetlands is particularly challenging in this region as growing seasons are short, precipitation is variable and often limiting, and the presence of elevated salinity associated with the mining process can be harmful to vegetation. As part of their reclamation programme, Syncrude Canada Ltd constructed a series of test plots (termed cells) to examine specific procedures and management strategies associated with wetland reclamation. In this study, water balance of 12 cells (each similar to 400m(2) in area) with different soil and vegetation treatments were studied over two growing seasons to understand the influence of soil salvage, vegetation, and placement strategy on water balance components. Cells were constructed in (i) the summer or winter, (ii) with either stockpiled material planted with vegetation or with soils directly transplanted from a nearby wetland and (iii) with soil depths of 15, 50 and 100 cm. Cells were built on a liner to eliminate leakage and were watered using an irrigation system along with receiving precipitation inputs. In 2010, cells were irrigated between similar to 100 and 400 mm, and water tables were maintained at or near the surface for the duration of the growing season at most cells. In 2011, watering was reduced considerably, and water tables were on average much lower. Evapotranspiration (ET) losses measured using lysimetres varied throughout the season and among cells. ET rates were greater in 2010 than in 2011 because of wet conditions at the surface, and cells placed in the winter and with shallower organic soils (15 cm) also had enhanced ET. Cumulative water balance suggests that some cells had considerable leakage despite being constructed atop a geotextile. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Episodic flooding due to intense rainfall events is characteristic in many wetlands, which may modify wetland-atmosphere exchange of CO2. However, the degree to which episodic flooding affects net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) is poorly documented in supratidal wetlands of coastal zone, where rainfall-driven episodic flooding often occurs. To address this issue, the ecosystem CO2 fluxes were continuously measured using the eddy covariance technique for 4 years (2010-2013) in a supratidal wetland in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that over the growing season, the daily average uptake in the supratidal wetland was -1.4, -1.3, -1.0, and -1.3 g Cm-2 d(-1) for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. On the annual scale, the supratidal wetland functioned as a strong sink for atmospheric CO2, with the annual NEE of -223, -164, and -247 g Cm-2 yr(-1) for 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. The mean diurnal pattern of NEE exhibited a smaller range of variation before episodic flooding than after it. Episodic flooding reduced the average daytime net CO2 uptake and the maximum rates of photosynthesis. In addition, flooding clearly suppressed the nighttime CO2 release from the wetland but increased its temperature sensitivity. Therefore, effects of episodic flooding on the direction and magnitude of NEE should be considered when predicting the ecosystem responses to future climate change in supratidal wetlands.

AB While the physical processes driving energy fluxes in the high latitudes are universal, some of the controlling factors such as permafrost, temperature, and vegetation play a special role. Annual net radiation at Arctic treeline is larger over subarctic forest than over tundra as a result of smaller albedo during the snow-cover period. The absorbed solar radiation is notably larger in late winter. During the snow-free period, in well-watered areas, there is a hierarchy in potential evaporation from very high rates for shallow tundra lakes and ponds to low rates for well-drained upland heath terrain. With abundant moisture and warm conditions, open coniferous forests, dwarf deciduous forests, and sedge fens have similar energy and water balances. During the growing season when moisture is limiting, a sedge fen, more so than a coniferous forest, curtails its evaporation rate. Under cold conditions, however, coniferous forest has the smaller evaporation. Soil heat fluxes in summer comprise from 10% to 15% of the net radiation and are fairly uniform both temporally and spatially. The carbon budget of peatlands, which are major global repositories of carbon, responds strongly to air and soil temperatures and to the water balance. Warm and wet conditions support strong photosynthesis and a substantial methane flux. Warm and dry conditions favor strong respiration carbon losses from plants and soil. In a 2 x CO(2) world, substantial changes in temperature, precipitation, and energy and water balances are anticipated and these will drive substantial changes in the high-latitude carbon budget.

AB Sediment magnetic properties of a short core from Sharkey Lake, MN, record the effects of Euroamerican settlement and climate change over the last 150 yr. The onset of European-style farming led to increased erosion, reflected in high values of concentration-dependent parameters such as magnetic susceptibility (kappa), Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM), and Anhysteretic Remanent Magnetization (ARM). These high values are only partially due to increased supply of terrigenous material to the lake, and recent sediment contains an additional component of authigenic fine (single-domain) magnetite, most likely magnetosomes from magnetotactic bacteria. High organic productivity in the lake during the 1920s to 1940s drought increased this authigenic component resulting in highly magnetic fine-grained sediment. A comparison with older Holocene sediment from the same lake shows that, over time, most of the fine magnetic signal is lost after deposition, leading to decreases in magnetization and a bimodal grain size distribution of ultrafine, superparamagnetic grains and coarser multidomain particles, evident from measurements of ARM/IRM ratios, hysteresis measurements, and low-temperature analyses. The effects of dissolution and the superposition of climate and land-use signals complicate the use of recent sediments as modem analogs for sediment magnetic analyses.

AB A strong relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulphate (SO42-) dynamics under drought conditions has been revealed from analysis of a 10-year time series (1993-2002). Soil solution from a blanket peat at 10 cm depth and stream water were collected at biweekly and weekly intervals, respectively, by the Environmental Change Network at Moor House-Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve in the North Pennine uplands of Britain. DOC concentrations in soil solution and stream water were closely coupled, displaying a strong seasonal cycle with lowest concentrations in early spring and highest in late summer/early autumn. Soil solution DOC correlated strongly with seasonal variations in soil temperature at the same depth 4-weeks prior to sampling. Deviation from this relationship was seen, however, in years with significant water table drawdown (>-25 cm), such that DOC concentrations were up to 60% lower than expected. Periods of drought also resulted in the release of SO42-, because of the oxidation of inorganic/organic sulphur stored in the peat, which was accompanied by a decrease in pH and increase in ionic strength. As both pH and ionic strength are known to control the solubility of DOC, inclusion of a function to account for DOC suppression because of drought-induced acidification accounted for more of the variability of DOC in soil solution (R-2=0.81) than temperature alone (R-2=0.58). This statistical model of peat soil solution DOC at 10 cm depth was extended to reproduce 74% of the variation in stream DOC over this period. Analysis of annual budgets showed that the soil was the main source of SO42- during droughts, while atmospheric deposition was the main source in other years. Mass balance calculations also showed that most of the DOC originated from the peat. The DOC flux was also lower in the drought years of 1994 and 1995, reflecting low DOC concentrations in soil and stream water. The analysis presented in this paper suggests that lower concentrations of DOC in both soil and stream waters during drought years can be explained in terms of drought-induced acidification. As future climate change scenarios suggest an increase in the magnitude and frequency of drought events, these results imply potential for a related increase in DOC suppression by episodic acidification.

AB A spatially explicit dynamic model was developed that combines water quantity and quality processes for an average Dutch peat polder. The model has been used to calculate the consequences of climate change for surface water level, groundwater level and nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, based on time series (2036-2065) of the two most extreme climate change scenarios for the Netherlands (G and W+) developed by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute. It was calibrated using measured data from two existing polders. The results suggest that surface water levels will not change much in both scenarios. Hence, the current practice of letting extra water in during dry summer periods to maintain sufficient water levels will probably remain a viable solution to temporary summer droughts in the near future as the required water volumes are not likely to increase greatly. Late summer groundwater levels decrease substantially in the W+ scenario but not in the moderate G scenario. This drop in groundwater level would accelerate the on-going process of peat oxidation, resulting in increased soil subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient release from mineralisation. The W+ scenario also led to higher nitrogen concentrations and lower phosphorus concentrations in the ditch network Probably the reduced stream velocity in the W+ scenario results in an increased sedimentation of (adsorbed) phosphate. Sedimentation is a less important process in the nitrogen cycle, and the increased nitrogen concentrations anticipated in summer according to the W+ scenario are therefore probably the consequence of a reduced outlet of water due to increased evaporation. Additionally, an increased delivery of nitrogen through mineralisation could also contribute to the increased nitrogen concentrations in summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The response of peat-rich permafrost soils to human-induced climate change may be especially important in modifying the global C-flux. We examined the Holocene developmental record of a High Arctic peat-forming wetland to investigate its sensitivity to past climate change and aid understanding of the likely effects of future climate warming on high-latitude ecosystems.
   The microhabitat of mosses was quantified in the present-day polygon-complex at Bylot Island (73 degrees N, 80 degrees W) and used to interpret the radiocarbon-dated macrofossil record of three cores, comprising c. 3500 years of wetland development. Recurrent wet and dry phases in the reconstructed palaeohydrological record indicated pronounced temporal variability. Wet and dry phases were compared between cores and with palaeoclimatic proxy values, measured as percentage melt and delta O-18 in nearby ice cores.
   Periodic wet and dry phases appear unrelated to past climate over c. 50% of the combined stratigraphic records, and are attributable instead to geomorphological mechanisms. At other times, association of wet and dry phases with significantly lower and higher values of percentage melt and delta O-18 indicate a possible effect of past climate change on polygon hydrology and vegetation, although inconsistencies between cores suggest that local geomorphological processes continued to modify a regional climatic effect. However, during a period incorporating the Little Ice Age (c. 305-530 cal. years BP), reconstructed moisture and vegetation change is pronounced and consistent among all three cores.
   The results provide strong evidence for the sensitivity of a High Arctic terrestrial ecosystem to past climate change during the Holocene. The estimated magnitude of changes in soil moisture between wet and dry phases is sufficient to imply recurrent shifts in wetland function, periodically impacted upon by pronounced climatic variability, although controlled principally by autogenic processes. The structure and function of such wetlands may therefore be susceptible to predicted, human-induced climate warming.

AB [1] Growing season CH4 fluxes were monitored over a two year period following the start of ecosystem-scale manipulations of water table position and surface soil temperatures in a moderate rich fen in interior Alaska. The largest CH4 fluxes occurred in plots that received both flooding (raised water table position) and soil warming, while the lowest fluxes occurred in unwarmed plots in the lowered water table treatment. A combination of treatment and soil hydroclimate variables explained more than 70% of the variation in lntransformed CH4 fluxes, with mean daily water table position representing the strongest predictor. We used quantitative PCR of the alpha-subunit of mcr operon to explore the influence of soil climate manipulations on methanogen abundances. Methanogen abundances were greatest in warmed plots, and showed a positive relationship with mean daily CH4 fluxes. Our results show that water table manipulations that led to soil inundation (flooding) had a stronger effect on CH4 fluxes than water table drawdown. Seasonal CH4 fluxes increased by 80-300% under the combined wetter and warmer soil climate treatments. Thus, while warming is expected to increase CH4 emissions from Alaskan wetlands, higher water table positions caused by increases in precipitation or disturbances such as permafrost thaw that lead to thermokarst and flooding in wetlands will stimulate CH4 emissions beyond the effects of soil warming alone. Consequently, we argue that modeling the effects of climate change on Alaskan wetland CH4 emissions needs to consider the interactive effects of soil warming and water table position on CH4 production and transport.

ID CATCHMENT
AB Strong winds are a characteristic feature of UK upland areas. Despite this, understanding of aeolian processes in upland environments of the UK is limited. This paper presents direct measurements and observations of blanket peat erosion by wind action during a two week period of desiccation in the North Pennines, Northern England. A circular configuration of mass flux sediment samplers was used to collect peat eroded by wind action from 16 cardinal compass directions. Meteorological conditions (wind speed, wind direction, precipitation and temperature) were recorded by an automatic weather station set up adjacent to the site. Surface desiccation led to peat crust erosion and dust deflation. During short (<= 1 hour) periods of precipitation, wind-driven rainfall also caused erosion. Topically, dust flux rates were up to two orders of magnitude lower than recorded during periods of sustained wet weather. Measurements demonstrate the hitherto unreported rapid switch in process regime between wind-driven rainfall and dry blow deflation in blanket peat environments. Dry blow processes of blanket peat erosion may become more important in UK upland areas if climate change promotes more frequent surface desiccation. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We report a new peat delta C-13 proxy record for humidity or precipitation based on C3 plants from northeastern China. The record reveals two times of significant climate shift and eight severe drought periods during the past 6000 years, all of which have the nature of widespread global occurrence. The variability of precipitation shows periodicities of around 70, 80, 90, 107, 110, 123, 134, 141, 162, 198, 205, 249, 278, 324, 389, 467, 584, 834 and 1060 years. The occurrence and persistent times of drought and periodicities of precipitation show good correspondence with solar variability. The remarkable correlations between peat delta C-13, peat delta O-18 and atmospheric Delta C-14 suggest that on timescales of decades to centuries the changes in drought and precipitation are likely caused by variations of atmospheric circulation and atmosphere-ocean interactions in large-scale patterns that seem to be related to solar variability.

AB Long-term complex observations covering the period of 1949-2018 made possible to determine the average annual characteristics of the depth of freezing of wetlands in the North and Northwest of the European territory of Russia together with main factors of its formation, and spatial and temporal variability. The main factors that determine the depth of freezing of wetlands are ambient temperature, snow cover thickness, and a degree of watering of the micro landscape (water reserves of the micro landscape). At the initial stage of freezing, the major factor is the ambient temperature, when intensity of the freezing reaches 0.5-0.8 cm/day. As snow falls, the freezing rate becomes smaller, and when the snow cover thickness reaches 25-30 cm the depth amounts to 0.2-0.3 cm/day and smaller. It was found that the spatial variability of the freezing depth decreases from large values of the coefficient of variation (0.3-0.4) at the depth of 20-30 cm to less than 0.1 when the depth exceeds 60 cm. The largest values of the depth are recorded in the North of the Kola Peninsula, where sometimes they reach from 84 to 97 cm with the average values of 48-66. In large hummocky bogs, when the seasonal freezing comes down to 63-65 cm it links with the permafrost layer. On average, swamps of these bogs freeze down to a depth of 68 cm. The average climatic depth of freezing of oligotrophic bogs of the North-West is 21-24 cm; in some years, freezing of them reaches 32-40 cm. It has been shown that the relative warming of the climate resulted in decreasing in the depth of freezing of wetlands in the North and North-West of the European territory of Russia. Relative to the previous climatic period, the depth of frost penetration in the northern Ilasskoye bog decreased by 32%, and in north-western Lammin-Suo bog - by 31%.

AB With the aim of addressing the broader issues of land use, climate change and energy crisis, eddy covariance measurements of energy and CO2 exchange from a bioenergy crop (reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinaceae, L) cultivated on a drained organic soil (a cutover peatland) in eastern Finland were initiated in the spring of 2004. Based on the climatically diverse dataset from the 2004 to 2010 period, the objectives of the work presented here are to characterize the interannual variability in water vapor exchange and to understand the linkage between energy and CO2 exchange from this perennial crop during two extreme growing seasons. Correcting the measured soil heat flux by accounting for the change in heat storage above the heat flux plates helped close the energy balance at this site. Interannual variability in ecosystem processes of energy and CO2 exchange were attributed primarily to marked differences in the amount and distribution of seasonal precipitation. Differences in the phonological development of the crop during seasons with contrasting climatic conditions were reflected in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) estimated from the radiation instruments installed on the tower. Wet years were characterized by an even distribution of seasonal precipitation, low to moderate air and soil temperatures, lower solar and net radiation intensities (owing to reduced number of bright sunshine hours and therefore, higher amount of diffuse sky radiation), moderate to saturated soil moisture conditions and lower vapor pressure deficit. These climatic conditions resulted in high bulk surface conductance (g(s)), high evapotranspiration (ET) and low sensible heat flux with a peak seasonal Bowen ratio (beta = 0.1). These conditions were favourable for a high uptake of atmospheric CO2. Dry years, on the contrary, were marked by long dry spells during important phases of crop growth, climatic and soil moisture stress leading to high evaporative demand, low g(s) values, reduced evapotranspiration and high sensible heat flux (beta = 0.3-0.4). On a seasonal basis, the ET losses during a dry year were 13% lower compared to those during a wet year. The corresponding reduction in gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), however, was to the extent of 21%. Owing to the ability of this perennial crop to sequester large amounts of atmospheric carbon into its above- and below-ground biomass, the water use efficiency (defined as the slope of the linear regression of monthly values of GEP against ET) of this cultivation system was found to be 9.1 g CO2 per kg of H2O lost as ET. The results stemming from this work further support our earlier conclusions that this bioenergy system is a suitable land use option on drained and abandoned cutover peatlands with a high potential for offsetting CO2 load to the atmosphere.

AB We evaluated the effects of hydrologic setting on the growth sensitivity of two conifer species to recent atmospheric climatic variability and change in a region experiencing a warming (annual Tmin: 0.07 degrees C/decade) and wetting trend (total annual PPT 9.8 mmldecade; 1911-2012). Tree-ring chronologies were constructed for the boreal disjunct balsam fir (Abies balsamea; n = 72; 1916-2012) and range-centered eastern white pine (Pinus strobus; n = 84; 1707-2012) at three forested, groundwater-fed wetlands (fens) and their neighboring uplands in New York State, USA. Soil temperature monitoring in 2010 confirmed that upland soils were significantly warmer than fen soils during the spring and summer months (11.5-13.9 degrees C; p < 0.05). Climate-growth relationships for Abies balsamea varied substantially based on hydrologic setting and season. Compared with a remnant upland population that showed an increasingly negative sensitivity to warm summer temperatures over time A. balsamea positioned in fens were less sensitive to recent warming. While atmospheric climate-growth relationships were more consistent across hydrologic settings for Pinus strobus, we still observed qualitatively different responses to atmospheric climate variables between fen and upland populations. Overall, the climate-growth relationships identified in this study suggest that relative to trees growing in mesic upland soils, growth sensitivity to warm ambient climate in summer is ameliorated by groundwater inputs. The climate modulating effects of groundwater on tree-growth observed in our study suggests that for temperate and boreal regions where fens are abundant further consideration of groundwater influences on climate-growth relationships is warranted.

AB The impact of short-term climate anomalies and disturbances on past plant communities can be understood using high temporal or contiguous sedimentary pollen analysis. The response of pollen assemblages to decadal- to multidecadal-scale moisture variability was analyzed for the time intervals 3000-2200 and 1400-500 cal. yr BP. The hydroclimate and vegetation history for Minden Bog in southeastern Michigan were reconstructed using analyses of sedimentary testate amoebae and pollen. Results indicated that moisture anomalies accounted for 3% to 24% of the variation in arboreal pollen abundance for Fagus, Pinus, Quercus, and Tsuga. Betula pollen percentages did not appear to be affected by moisture variability. Given the longevity of these taxa, rapid arboreal pollen assemblage responses to moisture variability at decadal to multidecadal timescales were likely due to climate-induced changes in pollen productivity. Our data suggest that pollen-climate relationships may be counterintuitive at these fine temporal scales. For example, Tsuga pollen percentages generally increased during short-term dry events, in contrast to expected decreases in abundance with drying at millennial timescales based on empirical pollen-climate relationships. Results suggest caution should be used when inferring subdecadal to multidecadal climate variation from highly resolved pollen records. Rather, high-resolution pollen data may more accurately represent superimposed plant responses that are the composite of reproductive output nested within long-term plant community compositional changes in response to climatic variation.

AB The study, based on the examination of 70 published and unpublished pollen profiles from Poland and supplementary data from the surrounding regions, shows that an abrupt, episodic Alnus population decline at the end of the first millennium CE was a much more widespread event than has been previously reported, spanning large areas of the temperate and boreal zones in Europe. The data from Poland suggest that the decline was roughly synchronous and most likely occurred between the 9th and 10th centuries, with strong indications for the 10th century. The pollen data indicate that human impacts were not a major factor in the event. Instead, we hypothesize that one or a series of abrupt climatic shifts that caused floods and droughts at the end of the first millennium CE could have initiated this ecological disturbance, leading to a higher vulnerability of the alder trees to a pathogen outbreak. Following current observations of the decline of alder stands in Europe due to a Phytophthora outbreak, we suggest that a similar process may have occurred in the past. This study provides insight into long-term alder (mainly Alnus glutinosa) dynamics in a condition of climate change and illustrates its great resilience, enabling the natural, successful regeneration of alder stands after critical diebacks if environmental conditions improve. Our finding that the Alnus pollen decline reflects a roughly synchronous event indicates that the decline could be used as an over-regional chronostratigraphic marker for 800-1000 CE in pollen diagrams from a large part of the European Lowland.

AB Soil carbon in permafrost ecosystems has the potential to become a major positive feedback to climate change if permafrost thaw increases heterotrophic decomposition. However, warming can also stimulate autotrophic production leading to increased ecosystem carbon storage-a negative climate change feedback. Few studies partitioning ecosystem respiration examine decadal warming effects or compare responses among ecosystems. Here, we first examined how 11 years of warming during different seasons affected autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration in a bryophyte-dominated peatland in Abisko, Sweden. We used natural abundance radiocarbon to partition ecosystem respiration into autotrophic respiration, associated with production, and heterotrophic decomposition. Summertime warming decreased the age of carbon respired by the ecosystem due to increased proportional contributions from autotrophic and young soil respiration and decreased proportional contributions from old soil. Summertime warming's large effect was due to not only warmer air temperatures during the growing season, but also to warmer deep soils year-round. Second, we compared ecosystem respiration responses between two contrasting ecosystems, the Abisko peatland and a tussock-dominated tundra in Healy, Alaska. Each ecosystem had two different timescales of warming (<5years and over a decade). Despite the Abisko peatland having greater ecosystem respiration and larger contributions from heterotrophic respiration than the Healy tundra, both systems responded consistently to short- and long-term warming with increased respiration, increased autotrophic contributions to ecosystem respiration, and increased ratios of autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration. We did not detect an increase in old soil carbon losses with warming at either site. If increased autotrophic respiration is balanced by increased primary production, as is the case in the Healy tundra, warming will not cause these ecosystems to become growing season carbon sources. Warming instead causes a persistent shift from heterotrophic to more autotrophic control of the growing season carbon cycle in these carbon-rich permafrost ecosystems.

AB This study aims to develop models to describe CO2 fluxes in terms of environmental and meteorological variables and their variation over an Atlantic blanket bog in Glencar, southwest Ireland. Ten full years (September 2002-August 2012) of data were included in the assessment of CO2 flux and micrometeorological data. Models were based on non-gapfilled growing season data, using complete calendar years for annual models, and the entire time-series for weekly models, whilst taking interaction between variables into account for increased model accuracy. This was to determine which environmental variables were most influential in directly controlling CO2 exchange on a long- and short-term basis. A homogeneity of slopes (HOS) model was used to determine if there was any ecosystem response to indirect effects (functional response) of environmental or meteorological interannual variation. This model uses multiple regression analysis to determine if the ecosystem response can be better predicted as a linear function of the variables using a single slope model for all years, or a separate slopes model for each year. The separate slopes model gave a different (and improved) outcome for both daytime and night-time CO2 fluxes, and so functional responses were deemed to have occurred. The contribution to variation of day and night-time net ecosystem exchange (NEEday and NEEnight respectively) was then separated into four components: indirect functional responses, direct interannual meteorological variability, direct week to week meteorological variability, and random error, which identified 13.8%, 36.6%, 28.2% and 21.4% respectively of the variation in NEEday, as well as 23.4%, 24.4%, 22.2% and 30% respectively of the variation in NEEnight. Water table level (WTL) had the greatest influence upon functional variation of NEE at the Glencar blanket peatland, and comparisons of modelled NEEday with leaf area index (LAI) measurements verified the estimate of functional contribution using the separate slopes model. The significance of interannual variation (IAV) and functional responses on NEE at Glencar suggests that it is a resilient ecosystem which might be able to adapt to environmental or climatic changes, although given current climate change predictions, it is likely to have a reduced carbon dioxide sink status in the future.

AB Boreal forests at high latitudes are climate-sensitive ecosystems that respond directly to environmental forcing by changing their position according to latitude or by changing their abundance at local and regional scales. South of the arctic treeline, external forcing (warming, cooling, drought, fire) necessarily results in the changing abundance of the impacted forests; in particular, the deforestation of well-drained sites through fire is the most important factor. In this study, we examined the changing abundance of wetland forests located at the arctic treeline (northern Quebec, Canada) during the last 1500 years, a period of known contrasting climatic conditions. Black spruce (Picea mariana) trees submerged in small lakes and peatland ponds and soil-peat stratigraphy were used concurrently to reconstruct the millennial-long developmental sequence of wetland stands associated with moisture changes and fire disturbance. Changing lake levels from AD 300 to the present were identified based on radiocarbon-dated submerged paleosols and tree-rinc, cross-dating of submerged trees distributed in three wetlands from the same watershed. Dead and living trees in a standing position below and above present water level of a small lake (LE Lake) showed direct evidence of past water levels from the 12th century to the present day. Submerged subfossil trees from another lake (LB Lake) and two peatland ponds (PB Peatland) also responded synchronously to changes in soil moisture during the last 1500 years. Regional-scale catastrophic flooding around AD 1150, inferred from paleosol and subfossil tree data, eliminated riparian peat and wetland trees growing at least since AD 300. Also, the coincidence of events such as the mass mortality of wetland spruce and post-fire deforestation of a small hill surrounding LE Lake during the late 1500s suggests the impact of local-scale flooding, probably attributable to greater snow transportation and accumulation on the lake surface after fire disturbance. Massive tree mortality climaxed at ca. 1750, when all wetland trees at LB Lake and PB Peatland died because of permafrost disturbance and soil upthrusting. Lower water levels from AD 300 to 1750 were associated with drier conditions, possibly caused by greater evaporation and/or reduced snow accumulation. Permafrost development in shallow waters occurred during the Little Ice Age, after 1600. It is concluded that the climate at the eastern Canadian treeline was warmer and drier from AD 300 to the onset of the Little Ice Age and promoted tree establishment. The highest water levels were recorded recently (19th and 20th centuries), causing lake and peatland expansion. Any future Moisture changes at these subarctic latitudes will result in important spatial rearrangements of wetland ecosystems.

AB The Mediterranean region is highly sensitive to climate change, particularly with regard to warming and increasing aridity. Understanding its past climate history during periods similar to the Holocene is key to understand the long-term dynamics that accompany anthropogenic climate change. Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (ca. 424-367 ka BP) is considered one of the best Holocene analogues. Despite detailed insight from Atlantic marine records and European continental records, MIS 11 temperature and rainfall evolution in the Mediterranean remains poorly understood.
   We present a detailed record of MIS 11-10 climate change at Tenaghi Philippon, a telmatic peatland in NE Greece. We use microbial membrane lipids (brGDGTs), the delta D of n-C-29 (delta D-wax) and distribution of n-alkanes derived from plant leaf waxes, and levoglucosan concentrations to reconstruct changes in temperature, rainfall sources and vegetation burning. Glacial-interglacial temperature patterns indicate strong Atlantic influence in the Eastern Mediterranean region.
   Low delta D-wax values and high temperatures indicate a predominance of Atlantic-sourced winter precipitation during MIS 11, and vice versa during MIS 10. The latter is attributed to a suppression of the Mediterranean storm track, probably due to a persistent high-pressure cell over most of the European continent, mainly in response to an extended ice cover during the glacial. The levoglucosan record is consistent with rapid change to drier conditions and increased vegetation burning from MIS 11 to 10. Millennial-scale oscillations allow to characterise cooling episodes previously recorded at other sites, with conditions of decreased winter precipitation, while suggesting increased seasonality during the interglacial optimum.

AB Emissions of b ogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from dry ecosystems at high latitudes respond strongly to small increases in temperature, and warm canopy surface temperatures drive emissions to higher levels than expected. However, it is not known whether emissions from wetlands, cooled by through-flowing water and higher evapotranspiration show similar response to warming as in drier ecosystems. Climate change will cause parts of the Arctic to experience increased snow fall, which delays the start of the growing season, insulates soil from low temperatures in winter, and increases soil moisture and possibly nutrient availability. Currently the effects of increasing snow depth on BVOC emissions are unknown. BVOC emissions were measured in situ across the growing season in a climate experiment, which used open top chambers to increase temperature and snow fences to increase winter snow depth. The treatments were arranged in a full factorial design. Measurements took place during two growing seasons in a fen ecosystem in west Greenland. BVOC samples collected by an enclosure technique in adsorbent cartridges were analysed using gas chromatography -mass spectrometry. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) was measured with a closed chamber technique, to reveal any immediate effect of treatments on photosynthesis, which could further influence BVOC emissions. Isoprene made up 84-92% of the emitted BVOCs. Isoprene emission increased 240 and 340% due to an increase in temperature of 1.3 and 1.6 degrees C in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Isoprene emissions were 25 times higher in 2015 than in 2014 most likely due to a 2.4 degrees C higher canopy air temperature during sampling in 2015. Snow addition had no significant effect on isoprene emissions even though GEP was increased by 24%. Arctic BVOC emissions respond strongly to rising temperatures in wet ecosystems, suggesting a large increase in arctic emissions in a future warmer climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The moss cover is an edificator of terrestrial communities in boreal zones. It affects many key processes involved in matter and energy transportation. The associations between mosses and N-2-fixing cyanobacteria influence the balance of N and C in the northern latitudes. It is predicted that climate change will lead to structural and functional rearrangements in the associations between cyanobacteria and bryophytes which will result in increased rates of N. The most widespread bryophyte associations with cyanoprokaryotes are found in bogs. They have an impact on the Earth's climate. In turn, climate change causes significant structural and functional reorganization of bogs ecosystems. The described relationship makes it necessary to do comprehensive analysis of bog ecosystems at expected or observed climatic changes. The obtained data could help to forecast changes in C and N pools. The aim of the investigation was to seasonal observations composition, structure and N-2-fixing activity of cyanobacteria in bryophyte complexes in taiga bogs. We were conduct field and laboratory studies (in May-October 2018) on daily and seasonal N-2-fixing activity (using the acetylene reduction method) which occur in associations between Sphagnum mosses and cyanobacteria in various types of the floodplain bogs. The basis of epiphytic groups on Sphagnum mosses is formed by cyanobacteria N-2-fixing: Nostoc paludosum, Microchaete tenera, Anabaena verrucosa, Hapalosiphon pumilus. The quantitative characteristics of cyanobacteria in the epiphytic groups of Sphagnum mosses from 20 to 350 thousand colonies per dm(2) of moss cover were noted. Seasonal changes in the quantitative indices of cyanobacteria were revealed. The maximum rates of nitrogenase activity were noted for the warmest month (July) in the range 0.78 to 2.12 mg C2H4/(m(2).h). The dependence of the N-2-fixing process on temperature was studied, and on its basis, nitrogen-fixing activity were calculated for the growing period (156 days): 1.28-3.02 g C2H4/m(2), or 1.51-3.50 g N/m(2).

AB Climate change in the UK is expected to cause increases in temperatures, altered precipitation patterns and more frequent and extreme weather events. In this review we discuss climate effects on dissolved organic matter (DOM), how altered DOM and water physico-chemical properties will affect treatment processes and assess the utility of techniques used to remove DOM and monitor water quality. A critical analysis of the literature has been undertaken with a focus on catchment drivers of DOM character, removal of DOM via coagulation and the formation of disinfectant by-products (DBPs). We suggest that: (1) upland catchments recovering from acidification will continue to produce more DOM with a greater hydrophobic fraction as solubility controls decrease; (2) greater seasonality in DOM export is likely in future due to altered precipitation patterns; (3) changes in species diversity and water properties could encourage algal blooms; and (4) that land management and vegetative changes may have significant effects on DOM export and treatability but require further research. Increases in DBPs may occur where catchments have high influence from peatlands or where algal blooms become an issue. To increase resilience to variable DOM quantity and character we suggest that one or more of the following steps are undertaken at the treatment works: a) 'enhanced coagulation' optimised for DOM removal; b) switching from aluminium to ferric coagulants and/or incorporating coagulant aids; c) use of magnetic ionexchange (MIEX) pre-coagulation; and d) activated carbon filtration post-coagulation. Fluorescence and UV absorbance techniques are highlighted as potential methods for low-cost, rapid on-line process optimisation to improve DOM removal and minimise DBPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB It is widely accepted that the Earth's climate is changing more rapidly than it has in the past and that over the next 100 years temperatures will rise and patterns of precipitation will be altered. These predictions for the future have important implications for all ecosystems, particularly those, such as wetlands, whose ecological character is very dependent on its hydrological regime. 41 The potential impacts of climate change on wetland hydrology are of interest to a wide range of stakeholders from wetland managers to international policy makers. Ecohydrological models that combine climate changes, hydrological processes and ecological response provide a means of estimating what might happen to some wetland functions and species in the future. This paper presents a framework that can be used for combining models and available data at a regional scale and is appropriate for different wetlands, in different countries and for different levels of data availability. The simple models are based on broad conceptual understanding of wetland hydrology and are intended to describe basic ecohydrological processes within the constraints of data availability; they are thus fit for the purpose of general assessment and do not pretend to provide precise results for specific wetland sites. Data from Great Britain (GB) have been used to demonstrate each step in the framework for two temperate wetland types: rain-fed wetlands (wet heaths or degraded raised mires) and floodplain margins. Whilst GB may be considered to be relatively data rich, we believe that sufficient information is available in many countries to apply this framework for the regional assessment of climate change impacts on wetlands. Although the models successfully represent the baseline conditions, it is not possible to test whether they accurately predict the future vulnerability of the selected areas. Results for GB suggest that predictions of reduced Summer rainfall and increased summer evaporation will put stress on wetland plant communities in late summer and autumn with greater impacts in the south and east of GB. In addition, impacts on rain-fed wetlands will be greater than on those dominated by river inflows. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Our aim was to determine whether the response of below-ground feedback processes to atmospheric warming affects nutrient dynamics and primary production in a model peatland ecosystem. Specifically, we examined the interactions between a dominant soil animal of a blanket peat ecosystem (Enchytraeidae. Oligochaeta) and microbes in response to soil warming (to 6degreesC above current mean summer temperatures), and the consequences of these interactions for nutrient mineralisation and the growth of the graminoid Festuca ovina L. Enchytraeids reduced soil microbial biomass (total PLFA) by 23%, but did not affect soil nutrient availability or plant nutrient content. Enchytraeids did, however, increase C mineralisation by 8%, measured as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release in the soil solution. Atmospheric warming increased plant nutrient uptake (increasing shoot N and P contents by 12 and 11%. respectively). but reduced the function of enchytraeids with respect to their role in DOC release (by 16%). These findings suggest that in the short term, independent of the effects of enchytraeids. warming may have reduced the ability of the soil microbial biomass to immobilise nutrients and may have relaxed the competition for nutrients between plants and microbes in these nutrient poor soils. increasing the ability of plants to act as a nutrient sink. The results suggest that although soil warming may disrupt biological interactions that are presently operating in these ecosystems, this may not necessarily result in detrimental effects on ecosystem function, which we determined by the growth of F. ovina.

AB Potential changes in both the intensity and frequency of extreme drought events are vital aspects of regional climate change that can alter the distribution and dynamics of water availability and subsequently affect carbon cycles at the ecosystem level. The effects of extreme drought events on the carbon budget of peatland in the Zoige plateau and its response mechanisms were studied using an in-field controlled experimental method. The results indicated that the peatland ecosystem of the Zoige plateau functioned as a carbon sink while under the control (CK) or extreme drought (D) treatment throughout the entire growing season. Maximum fluxes of methane (CH4) emissions and the weakest carbon sink activity from this ecosystem were in the early growth stage, the most powerful carbon sink activity was during the peak growth stage, while the absorption sink activity of carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 was present during the senescence stage. Extreme drought reduced the gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-e) of the peatland ecosystem by 14.5% and 12.6%, respectively (p < 0.05) and the net ability to store carbon was reduced by 11.3%. Overall, the GPP was highly sensitive to extreme drought. Moreover, extreme drought significantly reduced the CH4 fluxes of the ecosystem and even changed the peatland from a CH4 emission source to a CH4 sink. Subsequent to drought treatment, extreme drought was also shown to have a carry-over effect on the carbon budget of this ecosystem. Soil water content and soil temperature were the main driving factors of carbon budget change in the peatland of the Zoige plateau, but with the increase in soil depth, these driving forces were decreased. The findings indicated that frequent extreme drought events in the future might reduce the net carbon sink function of peatland areas, with an especially strong influence on CO2.

AB Southern Florida's Everglades are at the front line of potential negative effects on aquatic ecosystems from climate change and associated sea-level rise. A diversity of aquatic habitats supports a rich assemblage of aquatic and terrestrial wildlife, including 36 vertebrates and 26 plant species federally listed as endangered, threatened, or candidate species. Anticipated climate-change trends for southern Florida include increased weather uncertainty with more droughts, higher temperatures, and an increased number of more intense storms. Hydrologic regimes, temperature, and CO2 have been strongly correlated with plant community structure, coral and fish abundance and diversity, and higher trophic-level responses. Higher levels of variability in extreme climatic events, such as droughts, have the potential to destabilize aquatic communities. Sea-level rise is expected to be 0.8 to 2 m over the next century, a serious problem in a landscape that rises only 5 cm/km from Florida Bay inland. Wading birds and other wildlife species dependent on fresh water are likely to decline because of salt-water overwash and inundation. In addition to causing habitat loss, saltwater inundation of the peat substrate of Everglades freshwater wetlands may increase C emissions from sequestered C released as peat is destroyed and freshwater plant communities die. Identification of those species and habitats most at risk and ways to increase habitat and landscape resilience to large-scale environmental change will be critical for maintaining a diverse and productive Everglades.

AB Aquatic invertebrates of groundwater-dependent wetlands can be sensitive to a drop in the groundwater table, which is considered one of the possible impacts of climate change. We investigated whether aquatic clitellate species are able to dwell in waterlogged substrates without surface water, in 27 spring fens studied across the Western Carpathians. A total of 78 clitellate species were recorded in pairs of samples from aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Semi-aquatic habitats had 27 species in common with aquatic habitats, but algal and fungal feeders were less frequent and abundant, and predatory leeches and Haplotaxis gordioides completely lacking. Terrestrial enchytraeid species enriched the semi-aquatic assemblages. The main change in clitellate composition was controlled by total organic carbon. The importance of further variables, however, differed between aquatic and semi-aquatic sites. Further analyses of semi-aquatic sites showed that the distribution of primarily aquatic species was mainly driven by physical and chemical variables, while that of soil dwellers was driven by depth. Except Tubifex tubifex and Nais communis, all aquatic species preferred the uppermost layer. Results indicate that, during extreme droughts, when aquatic habitats cease to exist, some aquatic clitellates can persist in the waterlogged substrate, while some aquatic specialists may face the risk of local extinction.

AB Alpine ecosystems are, similar to arctic ecosystems, characterized by a very long snow season. Previous studies investigating arctic or alpine ecosystems have shown that winter CO2 effluxes can dominate the annual balance and that the timing and duration of the snow cover plays a crucial role for plant growth and phenology and might also influence the growing season ecosystem CO2 strength and dynamics. The objective of this study was to analyze seasonal and annual CO2 balances of a grassland site at an elevation of 2440 m a.s.l in the Swiss central Alps. We continuously measured the NEP using the eddy covariance method from June 2013 to October 2014, covering two growing seasons and one winter. We analyzed the influence of snow melt date on the CO2 exchange dynamics at this site, because snow melt differed about 24 days between the 2 years. To this end, we employed a process-based ecosystem carbon cycling model to disentangle the co-occurring effects of growing season length, environmental conditions during the growing season, and physiological/structural properties of the canopy on the ecosystem carbon balance. During the measurement period, the site was a net sink for CO2 although winter efflux contributed significantly to the total balance. The cumulative growing season NEP as well as mean and maximum daily CO2 uptake rates was lower during the year with the later snow melt, and the results indicated that the differences were mainly due to differing growing season lengths.

AB The aim of this study was to detect vegetation change and to examine trophic interactions in a Sphagnum-dominated mire in response to raised temperature and nitrogen (N) addition. A long-term global-change experiment was established in 1995, with monthly additions of N ( 30 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) and sulfur (20 kg.ha(-1)yr(-1)) during the vegetation period. Mean air temperature was raised by 3.6 degrees C with warming chambers. Vegetation responses were negligible for all treatments for the first four years, and no sulfur effect was seen during the course of the experiment. However, after eight years of continuous treatments, the closed Sphagnum carpet was drastically reduced from 100% in 1995 down to 41%, averaged over all N-treated plots. Over the same period, total vascular plant cover ( of the graminoid Eriophorum vaginatum and the two dwarf-shrubs Andromeda polifolia and Vaccinium oxycoccos) increased from 24% to an average of 70% in the N plots. Nitrogen addition caused leaf N concentrations to rise in the two dwarf-shrubs, while for E. vaginatum, leaf N remained unchanged, indicating that the graminoid to a larger extent than the dwarf-shrubs allocated supplemented N to growth. Concurrent with foliar N accumulation of the two dwarf-shrubs, we observed increased disease incidences caused by parasitic fungi, with three species out of 16 showing a significant increase. Warming caused a significant decrease in occurrence of three parasitic fungal species. In general, decreased disease incidences were found in temperature treatments for A. polifolia and in plots without N addition for V. oxycoccos. The study demonstrates that both bryophytes and vascular plants at boreal mires, only receiving background levels of nitrogen of about 2 kg.ha(-1)yr(-1), exhibit a time lag of more than five years in response to nitrogen and temperature rise, emphasizing the need for long-term experiments. Moreover, it shows that trophic interactions are likely to differ markedly in response to climate change and increased N deposition, and that these interactions might play an important role in controlling the change in mire vegetation composition, with implications for both carbon sequestration and methane emission.

AB Pollen and charcoal analyses are presented from three south-central South Island Holocene age deposits. A spring bog site in the Idaburn Valley records small-leaved Olearia scrub and grassland in its immediate vicinity from c. 7100 yr B.P., when peat growth began, to 5000 yr B.P. After that date the valley bottom vegetation became increasingly short and open, and the bog ceased growing, probably as a result of increasingly droughty summers. The adjacent hilly country supported a forest/scrub cover of Podocarpus hallii, Phyllocladus alpinus, Halocarpus bidwillii, and small-leaved shrubs. A site in the Mackenzie Basin near Lake Pukaki recorded near total dominance by Phyllocladus alpinus scrub from c. 8000 yr B.P. until 5000 yr B.P. after which time Halocarpus bidwillii, Aciphylla, and grassland became increasingly important in response to drought and local fires. At a third site, again in the Mackenzie Basin, Halocarpus bidwillii formed a complete scrub cover at the time of Maori settlement at about 800-600 yr B.P. but fire then rapidly reduced the scrub to grassland. On the evidence of these and other southern South Island vegetation history records, the early Holocene appears to have had a relatively stable climate with moist summers. From 5000 yr B.P. on, evidence for drought and fire point to drier summers and unstable, ENSO-affected climates.

AB Climate scenarios for high-latitude areas predict not only increased summer temperatures, but also larger variation in snowfall and winter temperatures. By using open-top chambers, we experimentally manipulated both summer temperatures and winter and spring snow accumulations and temperatures independently in a blanket bog in subarctic Sweden, yielding six climate scenarios. We studied the effects of these scenarios on flowering phenology and flower production of Andromeda polifolia (woody evergreen) and Rubus chamaemorus (perennial herb) during 2 years. The second year of our study (2002) was characterized by unusually high spring and early summer temperatures.
   Our winter manipulations led to consistent increases in winter snow cover. As a result, average and minimum air and soil temperatures in the high snow cover treatments were higher than in the winter ambient treatments, whereas temperature fluctuations were smaller. Spring warming resulted in higher average, minimum, and maximum soil temperatures. Summer warming led to higher air and soil temperatures in mid-summer (June-July), but not in late summer (August-September).
   The unusually high temperatures in 2002 advanced the median flowering date by 2 weeks for both species in all treatments. Superimposed on this effect, we found that for both Andromeda and Rubus, all our climate treatments (except summer warming for Rubus) advanced flowering by 1-4 days. The total flower production of both species showed a more or less similar response: flower production in the warm year 2002 exceeded that in 2001 by far. However, in both species flower production was only stimulated by the spring-warming treatments.
   Our results show that the reproductive ecology of both species is very responsive to climate change but this response is very dependent on specific climate events, especially those that occur in winter and spring. This suggests that high-latitude climate change experiments should focus more on winter and spring events than has been the case so far.

AB Palynological and geochemical analyses provide valuable information about modern and past climatic regimes and vegetation. The impact of climate and humans on past vegetation in the semi-arid areas of northwestern Iran has received increased interest in the wake of warming temperatures in the Middle East. Palynological and down-core XRF elemental abundances from a peat core from Lake Neor enabled a reconstruction of vegetational changes of the past 7000 years over the highlands of northwestern Iran. Periods of increased arboreal pollen (AP) types and high (Artemisia + Poaceae)/Chenopodiaceae ratios along with low titanium abundances, high percentages of total organic carbon, more negative delta D values, and higher carbon accumulation rates suggest a relatively wet climate. These conditions have persisted during the periods 6700-6200, 5200-4450 and 3200-2200 cal a bp. The overall low AP values, substantial rise of Chenopodiaceae, high Ti abundances and low values of palaeo-redox proxies, are all evidences of a drier climate, as has been reconstructed for the periods 6200-5200 and 4030-3150 cal a bp and the last 2200 years. An important feature of the last centuries is the increase of anthropogenic and pastoral indicator pollen types. Our results may provide basic data to predict future trends in vegetation dynamics under future climate change in western Asia.

AB To understand spatial and temporal variations of nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, we chose to measure N2O emissions from three plant stands (Kobresia tibetica, Carex muliensis, and Eleocharis valleculosa stands) in an open fen on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau during the growing seasons from 2005 to 2007. The overall mean N2O emission rate was about 0.018 +/- 0.056 mgN m(-2)h(-1) during the growing seasons from 2005 to 2007, with highly spatiotemporal variations. The hummock (K. tibetica stand) emitted N2O at the highest rate about 0.025 +/- 0.051 mgNm(-2)h(-1), followed by the hollow stands: the E. valleculosa stand about 0.012 +/- 0.046 mgNm(-2)h(-1) and the C. muliensis stand about 0.017 +/- 0.068 mgNm(-2)h(-1). Within each stand, we also noted significant variations of N2O emission. We also observed the significant seasonal and inter-annual variation of N2O fluxes during the study period. The highest N2O emission rate was all recorded in July or August in each year from 2005 to 2007. Compared with the mean value of 2005, we found the drought of 2006 significantly increased N2O emissions by 104 times in the E. valleculosa stand, 45 times in K. tibetica stand, and 18 times in the C. muliensis stand. Though there was no significant relation between standing water depths and N2O emissions, we still considered it related to the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water regime under climate change.

AB Since 2002, ground and ground surface temperatures have been systematically measured in the mountains of Troms and Finnmark, northern Norway. These data were used to calibrate and validate a transient heat flow model and a spatial permafrost model, to address ground thermal development since the end of the Little Ice Age, as well as possible permafrost responses to anticipated future climate changes. Approximately 20 per cent of the land area is underlain by permafrost, and in Finnmark, permafrost in palsa mires seems to dominate. Both observations and modelling show that the present permafrost is mainly warm', with mean ground temperatures above -3 degrees C. Permafrost has warmed during the last century, and at one site our ground temperature observations show the degradation of permafrost over the intervening decade. The study identifies three major permafrost regions in northern Norway: (1) maritime mountain permafrost in western Troms; (2) continental permafrost above the treeline and in bogs in Finnmark; and (3) Low Arctic permafrost on the peninsula of VarangerhalvOya, forming a transition between the Scandinavian mountain-dominated permafrost in the south and the arctic permafrost towards the north and east.

AB Recent evidence indicates that our current soil C stores may be already changing from carbon sinks to sources, with reported increasing C losses in both gaseous (soil respiration) and aqueous (dissolved organic carbon, DOC forms) across large areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Current debates have mainly focused on climatic variables; however, accounting for the abiotic and biotic interactions is required to enable better quantifications of C dynamics. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the interactive effects of temperature, moisture and dominant mesofauna (enchytraeids) changes on C losses by incubating root-free sieved soil samples from a peatland soil during 13 weeks at two temperature (14 and 19 C) and two moisture (85 and 60% WHC) treatments under laboratory conditions. Our results showed that neither temperature nor moisture and invertebrates had a significant effect on respiration rates. In contrast, under favourable moisture conditions, the temperature induced changes in enchytraeid population numbers resulted in more DOC being released from these soils, possibly linked to the positive effects of animal activities on iron mobilisation and buffering the pH of the soil solution. Our results also confirmed that moisture contents of 60% WHC could severely affect their population numbers in these organic soils and hence, the functioning of these vulnerable ecosystems. Importantly, in agreement with previous studies, availability of easily accessible C sources seems to be a critical factor in the progressive declines of soil respiration and DOC production rates over time. Taken these findings together it is possible to conclude that the combined action of abiotic factors and their influence on soil fauna populations plays a key role in controlling SOM decomposition rates of these peatland soils.

AB The Amur River Basin is located in high latitudes, which is sensitive to the global climate change. However, only a few previous studies have tried to study the climate change in this region. To better understand the historical variation of vegetation and climate during the past 2000 years, we present a new palynological data from the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and compared the vegetation change along the Amur River Basin. It was possible to reconstruct climate based on vegetation composition before human disturbance. The results show that: the climate was moderately cold and humid during the 2000 to 700 cal yr BP, and the vegetation was mainly coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, and the abundance of Cyperaceae was relatively high. After that, the temperature and humidity declined, corresponding to the Little Ice Age. And the vegetation types also obviously changed that the conifers expanded, and the contents of broad-leaved trees and herbaceous Cyperaceae de-creased. Since about 150 cal yr BP, the climate tended to be warm which belonged to Current Warm Period, and the main vegetation type was the secondary forests. The spread of the Han farming culture accompanied by the territorial expansion of the Tang Dynasty to the Sanjiang Plain at around 1300 cal yr BP caused human disturbance occurred earlier in the Sanjiang Plain than the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains. Additionally, the anthropogenic activities obviously intensified during the past hundred years along the Amur River Basin.

AB Although most studies find temperature, soil moisture and water table to be important environmental factors that affect peatland carbon dynamics, the role of vegetation communities has been investigated less. Therefore, this study investigates whether peatland ecosystems produce heterogeneous CO2 fluxes due to differences in vegetation community. In addition, the study also examines which major environmental factors influence this vegetation. To achieve the aims of this study, four sites with different vegetation communities were established in a semi-natural peatland ecosystem in Poland. CO2 flux measurements were carried out using a closed dynamic chamber system. Measurement campaigns were carried out from April until December 2008, every 2-3 weeks. Measured ecosystem respiration (Reco) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) rates showed daily and seasonal variation at all investigated sites. Reco presented a strong dependence on soil temperature at the 5 cm depth, while NEE showed a strong dependence on solar radiation. The mean temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) for the four sites ranged between 3.17 and 8.3. The highest NEE and Reco values were obtained at the site represented by Caricetum elatae and the lowest NEE and Reco at the site represented by Calamagrostietum neglectae.

AB Recent results indicate contrasting Holocene moisture histories at different elevations in arid central Asia (ACA). However, relatively little is known about Holocene temperature changes at different elevations. Here we report an independently dated peat brGDGTs-based MBT'(5ME) record from the Narenxia peatland (NRX) in the southern Altai Mountains. The record suggests a long-term warming trend since similar to 7.7 cal. kyrbp, with a warmer stage during similar to 7-5.5 cal. kyrbp, a cold stage during similar to 5.5-4 cal. kyrbp, and a warming trend over the last similar to 4 kyr. The long-term warming trend indicated by the NRX MBT'(5ME) record is largely consistent with Holocene temperature records from nearby sites covering an altitudinal range of similar to 1700-4100 m above sea level. This consistent long-term warming trend at different elevations differs from the long-term Holocene drying/wetting trends at high/low elevations of the Altai Mountains. We propose that the warming trend and consequent permafrost thawing at high elevations could have resulted in increased meltwater runoff, which would have contributed to the long-term wetting trend at low elevations. Our findings potentially provide an improved understanding of regional climate change and associated water resource availability, with implications for their possible future status.

AB Moraine Bog lies just outside the outermost lateral moraine of Tiedemann Glacier in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia. A sediment core taken from the wetland was analyzed for pollen, magnetic susceptibility, and loss on ignition to reconstruct changes in vegetation and climate during the late Holocene. Vegetation changed little between about 3500 and 2400 C-14 years BP. A period of local disturbance marked by deposition of a silty clay bed and increases in Alnus pollen, likely reflecting cooler moister conditions, coincides with an extensive Holocene advance of Tiedemann Glacier about 2400 C-14 years BP. Warm dry conditions between about 1900 and 1500 C-14 years BP are suggested by peak values of Pseudotsuga pollen and increasing Nuphar sclereids; the latter suggests lowered water levels. This period coincides with a time of drought and increased fire frequency in the southernmost Coast Mountains. About 1300 C-14 years BP, the forest became more coastal in composition with abundant Tsuga heterophylla and Abies. An increase in Tsuga mertensiana pollen suggests the onset of cool and wet conditions by ca. 500 C-14 years BP, coincident with the Little Ice Age. The record of inferred climate change at Moraine Bog is broadly synchronous with other paleoclimate records from the Coast Mountains and, at the centennial scale, with records elsewhere in the world.

AB Subfossil remains of various groups of organisms preserved in peat and sediment archives are commonly used to infer past environmental changes using transfer functions based on species composition. However, the changes in community structure can also be explored using the functional trait approach. Investigation of functional traits in palaeoecological records can inform about the mechanisms through which abiotic variables such as temperature or moisture impact communities. Moreover, changes in functional traits provide information about changes in ecosystem functioning and can potentially lead to the reconstruction of past processes at the ecosystem scale. Here, we use five key functional traits of arcellinid testate amoebae (TAs), a group of protozoa that are key actors in the microbial foodwebs in peatlands. We apply this approach to the subfossil TA Holocene record of four geographically independent peatlands from Alaska, Switzerland, Poland and Russia. We found that species with larger shells were frequently eliminated from the communities most likely as a result of a switch towards drier conditions. However, when conditions were wetter, species with large shells and species with small shells could coexist because they differed in their trophic niche (i.e. preys). Our results show direct but site-specific links between TA trait data and the depth to water table and pH data inferred from TA species composition. This suggests that past environmental changes influenced both species composition and community function in these ecosystems. Overall, this study demonstrates that species- and trait-based approaches yield complementary information on past environmental changes. For instance, while taxonomic approaches reveal the changes in community composition over time, investigation of traits informs both on the causes and the consequences of these changes on ecosystem functioning.

AB Climate change scenarios for northern boreal regions indicate that there will be increasing temperature and precipitation, and the changes are expected to be larger in winter than in summer. These precipitation and discharge patterns, coupled with shorter ice cover/soil frost periods in the future would be expected to contribute significantly to changing flow paths of organic matter over a range of land use patterns. In order to study the impact of climate change on the seasonality of organic matter export we compared total organic carbon (TOC) and total organic nitrogen (TON) concentrations and export, during different seasons and climatically different years, over 12 years for 30 Finnish rivers separated into forest, agriculture and peat dominated catchments. The mean monthly TOC concentrations were highest during autumn and there was also a peak in May during the highest flow period. The mean monthly concentrations of TON were lowest during winter, increased in spring and remaining high throughout summer and autumn. The TOC/TON ratios were lowest during summer and highest during winter, and in all seasons the ratios were lowest in catchments with a high proportion of agricultural land and highest in peat-dominated catchments. The seasonality of TOC and TON exports reflected geographical location, hydrology and land use patterns. Most of the TOC and TON were transported during the high flow following the spring snowmelt and during rainfall in autumn. In all catchments the relative importance of the spring snowmelt decreased in wet and warm years. However, in peat-dominated catchments the proportion of spring period was over 30% of the annual export even in these wet and warm years, while in other catchments the proportion was about 20%. This might be linked to the northern location of the peat-dominated catchments and the permanent snow cover and spring snowmelt, even in warm years. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands occupy around 13% of the land cover of Canada, and thus they play a key role in the water balance at high latitudes. They are well known for having substantial water loss due to evapotranspiration. Since measurements of evapotranspiration are scarce over these environments, hydrologists generally rely on models of varying complexity to evaluate these water exchanges in the global watershed balance. This study quantifies the water budget of a small boreal peatland-dominated watershed. We assess the performance of three evapotranspiration models in comparison with in situ observations and the impact of using these models in the hydrological modeling of the watershed. The study site (similar to 1 km(2)) is located in the eastern James Bay lowlands, Quebec, Canada. During summer 2012, an eddy flux tower measured evapotranspiration continuously, while a trapezoidal flume monitored streamflow at the watershed outlet. We estimated evapotranspiration with a combinational model (Penman), a radiation-based model (Priestley-Taylor), and a temperature-based model (Hydro-Quebec), and performed the hydrological modeling of the watershed with HYDROTEL, a physically based semi-distributed model. Our results show that the Penman and Priestley-Taylor models reproduce the observations with the highest precision, while a substantial drop in performance occurs with the Hydro-Quebec model. However, these discrepancies did not appear to reduce the hydrological model efficiency, at least from what can be concluded from a 3-month modeling period. HYDROTEL appears sensitive to evapotranspiration inputs, but calibration of model parameters can compensate for the differences. These findings still need to be confirmed with longer modeling periods.

AB Rapidly rising temperatures in the Arctic might cause a greater release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. To study the effect of warming on GHG dynamics, we deployed open-top chambers in a subarctic tundra site in Northeast European Russia. We determined carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes as well as the concentration of those gases, inorganic nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) along the soil profile. Studied tundra surfaces ranged from mineral to organic soils and from vegetated to unvegetated areas. As a result of air warming, the seasonal GHG budget of the vegetated tundra surfaces shifted from a GHG sink of -300 to -198 g CO2 -eq m(-2) to a source of 105 to 144 g CO2 -eq m(-2). At bare peat surfaces, we observed increased release of all three GHGs. While the positive warming response was dominated by CO2, we provide here the first in situ evidence of increasing N2O emissions from tundra soils with warming. Warming promoted N2O release not only from bare peat, previously identified as a strong N2O source, but also from the abundant, vegetated peat surfaces that do not emit N2O under present climate. At these surfaces, elevated temperatures had an adverse effect on plant growth, resulting in lower plant N uptake and, consequently, better N availability for soil microbes. Although the warming was limited to the soil surface and did not alter thaw depth, it increased concentrations of DOC, CO2, and CH4 in the soil down to the permafrost table. This can be attributed to downward DOC leaching, fueling microbial activity at depth. Taken together, our results emphasize the tight linkages between plant and soil processes, and different soil layers, which need to be taken into account when predicting the climate change feedback of the Arctic.

AB Ecosystems exchange climate-relevant trace gases with the atmosphere, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are a small but highly reactive part of the carbon cycle. VOCs have important ecological functions and implications for atmospheric chemistry and climate. We measured the ecosystem-level surface-atmosphere VOC fluxes using the eddy covariance technique at a shallow subarctic lake and an adjacent graminoid-dominated fen in northern Sweden during two contrasting periods: the peak growing season (mid-July) and the senescent period post-growing season (September-October).
   In July, the fen was a net source of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, dimethyl sulfide, isoprene, and monoterpenes. All of these VOCs showed a did cycle of emission with maxima around noon and isoprene dominated the fluxes (93 +/- 22 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), mean +/- SE). Isoprene emission was strongly stimulated by temperature and presented a steeper response to temperature (Q(10) = 14.5) than that typically assumed in biogenic emission models, supporting the high temperature sensitivity of arctic vegetation. In September, net emissions of methanol and isoprene were drastically reduced, while acetaldehyde and acetone were deposited to the fen, with rates of up to -6.7 +/- 2.8 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) for acetaldehyde.
   Remarkably, the lake was a sink for acetaldehyde and acetone during both periods, with average fluxes up to -19 +/- 1.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetone in July and up to -8.5 +/- 2.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetaldehyde in September. The deposition of both carbonyl compounds correlated with their atmospheric mixing ratios, with deposition velocities of -0.23 +/- 0.01 and -0.68 +/- 0.03 cm s(-1) for acetone and acetaldehyde, respectively.
   Even though these VOC fluxes represented less than 0.5 % and less than 5 % of the CO2 and CH4 net carbon ecosystem exchange, respectively, VOCs alter the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Thus, understanding the response of their emissions to climate change is important for accurate prediction of the future climatic conditions in this rapidly warming area of the planet.

AB This article explores the start and end of a period of intensive farming in a karstic region on the west coast of Ireland in the late third and early second millennia BC in relation to episodes of climate change. Human responses to climate change in prehistory have been most frequently studied in regions prone to aridity and drought such as the Near East and the eastern Mediterranean where past climate shifts may have had more extreme effects and are likely to have left strong proxy signals. It is these same regions where early complex societies were located and the collapse or reorganization of these large complex societies can leave similarly strong traces in the archaeological record. In contrast, the present study is focused on the west coast of Ireland, an Atlantic island in a temperate oceanic climate region at a time when the societies living there are best described as small-scale segmentary societies. Geography therefore militated against the most extreme effects of climate change and there were no large complex societies to collapse; nevertheless there is evidence that climate change impacted these societies.

AB The analysis of long-term changes of mean annual temperatures and the active temperature sum over 80 years was carried out using data of the Khatanga meteorological station. Since the 1990s, an essential warming was observed, especially after 2000. The warming influence on vegetation takes place immediately (the ecosystem composition changes due to the degradation of cryogenic processes) as well as directly by increasing the time of the vegetation period and the total amount of heat on plants. As a result, in the last few years, the lead of phenological phenomena terms is observed - the time of foliage expansion and efflorescence of plants-indicators, geese arriving, mosquitos appearance, ice thawing. By long term monitoring data, the moving of some north-taiga plant species to forest tundra and tundra is observed, as well as their establishing in vegetation communities. However, at this moment, the character of the vegetation is stable. The occurrence of taiga animals is increased in tundra and forest tundra. An active revival of larch is observed in forest tundra and north sparse forests. A removing forest border to the north is not observed, but in the southern mountains of Taimyr its replacing on higher levels could be seen. A decreasing summer precipitation quantity increases the possibility of forest fires, spring and bog drying. It influences negatively on bog flora and near-water fauna. It is possible, that the main reason of the local climate change at the East of Taimyr is less connected to the global planet change, but much more to pulsations of the strong Siberian anticyclone.

AB Analysis of different sediments in NW Spain suggests that a series of abrupt climatic changes occurred between 3500 and 1000 BC. These involved some episodes of cooling and others of drought. There were also changes to the coastline of Galicia. Taken together, these would have offered new opportunities to Copper Age communities who had already embarked on a process of agricultural intensification. The result was a growth of internecine competition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The seed germination niche partly determines adaptation, ecological breadth and geographic range in plant species. In temperate wetlands, environmental temperature is the chief regulator of germination timing, but the ecological significance of high and low temperatures during dormancy break and germination is still poorly understood. Our aim was to characterize the temperature dimension of the germination niche in mountain base-rich fens, determining (1) the effect of different temperatures on dormancy break and germination, and (2) whether different germination strategies may be identified at the species level. We conducted laboratory germination experiments with seeds of 15 species from these habitats, collected in 18 fen sites in the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain) for two consecutive years. In all the species, the seeds were totally or conditionally dormant at dispersal and stratification produced a significant increase of germination. In most cases, there was not an obligatory requirement for cold temperatures during dormancy break, since warm stratification promoted germination as well. Although the optimal germination thermoperiod was generally high (30/20 A degrees C), most species could also germinate at lower temperatures after cold-stratification. We also identified a group of species associated to cold-water springs that germinated only at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that dormancy break in mountain base-rich fens does not obligatorily depend on cold temperatures during overwintering. Furthermore, germination at cool temperatures may be more widespread in wetland habitats than previously thought. The existence of two distinctive germination strategies, 'warm' and 'cool', can potentially give rise to divergent species responses to climate change.

AB Large uncertainties exist in predicting responses of wetland methane (CH4) fluxes to future climate change. However, sources of the uncertainty have not been clearly identified despite the fact that methane production and emission processes have been extensively explored. In this study, we took advantage of manual CH4 flux measurements under ambient environment from 2011 to 2014 at the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experimental site and developed a data-informed process-based methane module. The module was incorporated into the Terrestrial ECOsystem (TECO) model before its parameters were constrained with multiple years of methane flux data for forecasting CH4 emission under five warming and two elevated CO2 treatments at SPRUCE. We found that 9 degrees C warming treatments significantly increased methane emission by approximately 400%, and elevated CO2 treatments stimulated methane emission by 10.4%-23.6% in comparison with ambient conditions. The relative contribution of plant-mediated transport to methane emission decreased from 96% at the control to 92% at the 9 degrees C warming, largely to compensate for an increase in ebullition. The uncertainty in plant-mediated transportation and ebullition increased with warming and contributed to the overall changes of emissions uncertainties. At the same time, our modeling results indicated a significant increase in the emitted CH4:CO2 ratio. This result, together with the larger warming potential of CH4, will lead to a strong positive feedback from terrestrial ecosystems to climate warming. The model-data fusion approach used in this study enabled parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for forecasting methane fluxes.
   Plain Language Summary Methane (CH4) has 45 times the sustained-flux global warming potential of CO2 over a 100-year scale, and it is directly responsible for approximately 20% of global warming since pre-industrial time. Wetlands are the single largest natural source of CH4 emission and there is major concern about potential feedbacks between global climate change and CH4 emissions from wetlands, as warming and atmospheric CO2 are known to affect CH4 emissions. However, extensive observed CH4 flux data have not been well used to constrain model predictions of CH4 emission in the future climate. Using a data-model fusion approach, we constrained parameters and quantified uncertainties of CH4 emission forecast. We found both warming and elevated air CO2 concentrations have a stimulating effect on CH4 emission. The uncertainty in plant-mediated transportation and ebullition increased under warming.

AB Tropical forests make an approximately neutral contribution to the global carbon cycle, with intact and recovering forests taking in as much carbon as is released through deforestation and degradation. In the near future, tropical forests are likely to become a carbon source, owing to continued forest loss and the effect of climate change on the ability of the remaining forests to capture excess atmospheric carbon dioxide. This will make it harder to limit global warming to below 2 degrees C. Encouragingly, recent international agreements commit to halting deforestation and degradation, but a lack of fundamental data for use in monitoring and model design makes policy action difficult.

AB It has been predicted that Europe will experience a rise in temperature of 2.2-5.3 A degrees C within this century. This increase in temperature may lead to vegetation change along altitudinal gradients. To test whether vegetation composition has already changed in the recent decade due to current warming (and other concomitant environmental changes), we recorded plant species composition in 1995 and 2005/2006 in Swiss pre-alpine fen meadows (800-1,400 m a.s.l.). Despite no obvious changes in the management of these fens, overall, plant species richness (cumulative number of plant species at five plots per site) significantly increased over this period. This was mainly due to an increase in the number of thermophilous, rich-soil-indicator and shade-indicator species, which corresponded to increased community productivity and shading within the vegetation layer. In contrast, fen specialists significantly declined in species numbers. The strongest species shifts occurred at the lowest sites, which overall had a higher colonization rate by new species than did sites at higher altitudes. Vegetation change along the altitudinal gradient was also affected by different types of land management: early-flowering species and species with low habitat specificity had high colonization rates in grazed fens, especially at low altitudes.

AB Lipid biomarkers extracted from a sediment-peat sequence from the Sanjiang Plain were analyzed to assess the change in regional vegetation and climate during the last 8 ky. The combination of n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid distributions and published pollen and plant macrofossil records for the lake sediments underlying the peat reveal that the region experienced a warmer and wetter period before ca. 6 ka that corresponds to the monsoon maximum and Holocene climate optimum in northeast China. The climate then entered a cold and wet period from 6 to 4 ka. A shift to warmer and drier conditions starting 4 ka is recorded as a transformation from a shallow lake to a peat deposit. From 1.5 to 0.4 ka, the region entered a cold and wet period that was followed by warm and dry conditions for the most recent 0.4 ky. Our lipid-based paleoclimate reconstruction was compared with Holocene reconstructions based on lipid records from the nearby Hani peat sequence, peat cellulose delta C-13 results from the Jinchuan peat sequence, and pollen records from other lakes in northeast China. Most of the regional paleoclimate changes reconstructed from the lipid proxies in the Sanjiang Plain peat sequence have a strong link with sea surface temperature changes in the Sea of Japan that were influenced by summer solar insolation at 65 degrees N and the East Asia summer monsoon. In contrast, the change to the warmer and drier conditions of the last four centuries seems to be mainly a consequence of human activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition may reduce growth and accelerate decomposition of Sphagnum mosses in bogs. Sphagnum growth and rates of Sphagnum litter decomposition may also vary because of climate change as both processes are controlled by climatic factors. The initial purpose of this study was to assess if growth and litter decomposition of hummock and lawn Sphagnum species varied with increasing N input in a factorial mid-term (2002-2005) experiment of N and phosphorus (P) addition, in a bog on the southern Alps of Italy. However, as the experimental period was characterized by an exceptional heat wave in summer 2003, we also explored the interacting effects of fertilization and strongly varying climate on growth and decomposition rates of Sphagnum. The heat wave implied strong dehydration of the upper Sphagnum layer even if precipitation in summer 2003 did not differ appreciably from the overall mean. Sphagnum production was somewhat depressed by high levels (3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) of N addition without concomitant addition of P presumably because of nutrient imbalance in the tissues, but production rates were much lower than the overall means in 2003, when no effect of nutrient addition could be observed. Adding N at high level also increased the potential decay of Sphagnum litter. Higher CO2 emission from N-fertilized litter was due to amelioration of litter chemistry showing lower C/N quotients in the N-fertilized treatments. Rates of CO2 emission from incubated litter also were more strongly affected by water content than by nutrient status, with practically no CO2 emission detected when litter was dry. We conclude that higher rates of atmospheric N availability input may depress Sphagnum growth because of P, and presumably potassium, (co-)limitation. Higher N availability is also expected to promote potential decay of Sphagnum litter by ameliorating litter chemistry. However, both effects are less pronounced if the growing Sphagnum apex and the underlying senescing tissues dry out.

DT Review
DE Sub-Atlantic Period; Little Ice Age; lake sediment; shoreline; climate
   change; culture expansion
AB Climate change and cultural exchange both influenced cultural development along the continental Silk Road during the late Holocene, but climate change and its influence on nomadic civilizations during that time has yet to be systematically assessed. In this study, we analyzed records of climate change along the Silk Road covering key periods in the late Holocene, based on multiproxies from various archives including lake sediments, shorelines/beach ridges, peatlands, ice cores, tree rings, aeolian sediments, moraines, and historical documents. Combined with archaeological data, we assessed the influence of climate on development and expansion of representative pastoral nomadism. Our results show that the most notable climate changes in Central Asia were characterized by decreasing temperature, expanding glaciers, increasing precipitation, and increasing humidity during transitions from the Sub-Boreal to Sub-Atlantic Period (ca. 9-8th century BC) and from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age (ca. 13-14th century AD). The two periods coincided with Scythian Cultural expansion across the steppe landscape of Central Asia and rise of the Mongol Empire, respectively. These temporal coincidences are interpreted as causally related, where temperature fall and glacial advance may have forced the pastoral nomadism to southward migration. Coeval wetness and southward migration of steppe landscape in Central Asia were beneficial for these cultural expansions, which spanned the Eurasian arid and semi-arid zone westward. Therefore, during the historical period when productivity was underdeveloped, although expansions of pastoral nomadism were closely related to internal social structures, climate change was possibly the most critical controlling factor for sustainability development and collapse.

AB Subarctic wetlands that exist as bogs, fens, swamps, marshes and shallow water, comprise 3% of the Canadian landscape. They have been recognized as important ecotones between the arctic tundra and boreal forest. Recently, there has been growing research interest in the hydrological characteristics of arctic and subarctic wetland systems in the need for more efficiently conserving wetlands and assessing climate change related impacts. This research targets the Deer River watershed near Churchill, Manitoba, which represents a typical subarctic wetland system in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. An extensive field investigation was first conducted during the summer from 2006 to 2008 to facilitate in-depth understanding of the wetland hydrology. The results provided evidence to indicate a strong relationship between air temperature and evapotranspiration. Permafrost table, soil moisture and streamflow were monitored and analyzed to advance the acknowledgement of the climatic, geographical and hydrological characteristics of subarctic wetlands. To quantify the water cycle and further validate the findings from field investigation, a Canadian distributed hydrological model, WATFLOOD, was employed to simulate the hydrologic processes in the targeted watershed. The results demonstrated that snowmelt in the spring season (April-June) was the major source of water supplement of subarctic wetlands. Most light and moderate rainfall events in summer (July-September) generated relatively small amounts of runoff which can be related to canopy interception, depression storage, porous soil layers, impermeable permafrost and intensive evapotranspiration. A lag of 2-8 days between the peaks of rainfall and stream runoff was observed in both summer and fall. This study is expected to benefit wetland conservation and the assessment of climate change related impacts in the Canadian northern regions.

AB A homogenized 76-year daily-mean temperature series is presented for Moor House, an upland peatland meteorological station in northern England, which provides the longest instrumental temperature record in the UK uplands. This paper assesses trends in the temperature record over time compared to the nearby lowland temperature record at Durham. Overall warming for 1991-2006 compared with 1931-1960 and 1961-1990 was approximately the same at the upland site (0.53 degrees C and 0.73 degrees C for the two time periods, respectively) as at Durham (0.61 degrees C and 0.71 degrees C), maintaining a similar lapse rate. However, winter warming is dominant at Moor House and more pronounced and concentrated over a shorter period than at Durham; summer warming is more prominent at Durham. Therefore, seasonal lapse rates have changed and become more divergent between winter and summer half-years. Rather than changes in the dominance of particular air-masses over the study area accounting for seasonal lapse rate changes, there had been significant steepening of lapse rates over time for some air flow types. Minimum temperatures have increased more than maximum temperatures at Moor House with a consequent significant reduction in diurnal range. At Durham minimum and maximum temperatures have changed in approximate tandem so that there is no significant change in diurnal temperature range. The frequency of air frosts reduced by approximately 23% (from 129 days per year to 99) at Moor House from 1991-2006 compared to 1953-1980, and this may have major implications for the functioning of terrestrial and aquatic systems in the region. These results demonstrate that while overall annual warming in the uplands and lowlands within particular regions may be similar, even where annual lapse rates have been maintained, the seasonal distribution of that warming may be quite different even over short distances and so lowland records are not a reliable indicator of regional upland temperature change.

AB The low-Arctic region of western Hudson Bay in interior Canada is one of the most poorly described areas of North America in terms of Holocene climate history. Here, we present new data from a well-dated lake sediment core from northern Manitoba, Canada. We assemble one of the richest multi-proxy datasets to date for a low-Arctic lake and characterize terrestrial and lake processes and exchanges between them. These proxies include fossil pollen and diatom assemblages, charcoal, magnetic properties (susceptibility and remanance), mineral grain size, bulk density, organic-matter content, elemental geochemistry, sediment cation (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+/Fe3+) and macronutrient (P, N, C) contents, biogenic-silica content, basal peat dates (wetland initiation), and stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15). The sediment proxies record both broad- and fine-scale (millennial and sub-millennial) climate change. We find indirect evidence for a cool and dry post-glacial period from 9,000 to 6,500 cal yr BP, a warm and moist mid-Holocene period from 6,500 to 2,500 cal yr BP, and a cool and moist late-Holocene period from 2,500 cal yr BP to present. High-resolution geochemical data suggests 300- to 500-year-long dry periods at similar to 6,500-6,100, 5,300-5,000, 3,300-2,800, and 400-0 cal yr BP. These results suggest that terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem dynamics in the western Hudson Bay region are sensitive to past climate change and are likely to respond to future changes in temperature and precipitation.

AB Floating tephra was deposited together with ice core, snow layer, abyssal sediment, lake sediments, and other geological records. It is of great significance to interpret the impact on the climate change of volcanic eruptions from these geological records. It is the first time that volcanic glass was discovered from the peat of Jinchuan () Maar, Jilin () Province, China. And it is in situ sediments from a near-source explosive eruption according to particle size analysis and identification results. The tephra were neither from Tianchi () volcano eruptions, Changbai () Mountain, nor from Jinlongdingzi () volcano about 1 600 aBP eruption, but maybe from an unknown eruption of Longgang () volcano group according to their geochemistry and distribution. Geochemical characters of the tephra are similar to those of Jinglongdingzi, which are poor in silica, deficient in alkali, Na2O content is more than K2O content, and are similar to distribution patterns of REE and incompatible elements, which helps to speculate that they originated from the same mantle magma with rare condemnation, and from basaltic explosive eruption of Longgang volcano group. The tephra, from peat with age proved that the eruption possibly happened in 15 BC-26 AD, is one of Longgang volcano group eruption that was not recorded and is earlier than that of Jinglongdingzi about 1600 aBP eruption. And the sedimentary time of tephra is during the period of low temperature alteration, which may be the influence of eruption toward the local climate according to the correlativity of eruption to local temperature curve of peat cellulose oxygen isotope.

AB Wetland research has described changes in plant communities along environmental gradients, however, little is known about the relationship between fine-scale hydrologic and abiotic factors and the relative abundances of individual, co-occurring species. Larix laricina (Eastern Larch) and Picea mariana (Black Spruce) are the 2 dominant tree species in open boreal peatlands in the northeastern US. In order to describe abiotic gradients that correlate with species abundances at local spatial scales, we collected data on Eastern Larch and Black Spruce stem abundances, groundwater pH, conductivity, depth to water table, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and canopy closure from 42 plots along 6 transects in an Adirondack wetland. We correlated stem abundances with each of the abiotic variables and then used regression to explain variation in stem abundances of the 2 species along those abiotic gradients. Percent canopy closure explained 56% of the variability in Eastern Larch stem abundance, and depth to groundwater was also positively correlated with number of Eastern Larch stems. These 2 abiotic conditions covaried; thus, the best model to explain variability in Eastern Larch stem abundance included only canopy closure. Black Spruce stem abundance was significantly lower in plots with higher water temperatures (R-2 = 0.31). In a multiple-regression model, depth to the water table explained an additional 6% of the variance and substantially reduced Mallows' C-p. Eastern Larch and Black Spruce appear to establish along different abiotic gradients at the scale of tens of meters within this study wetland. Although light levels, as mediated by canopy closure, would be predicted to influence the establishment of Eastern Larch based on its silvics, the strong negative relationship between Black Spruce stem abundance and water temperature has not been previously reported. Sampling other peatlands will allow us to determine the universality of these patterns and to better understand which environmental gradients operate at local spatial scales to structure patterns of tree distribution within peatlands.

AB Stable Zn isotopes fractionation was studied in main biogeochemical compartments of a pristine larch forest of Central Siberia developed over continuous permafrost basalt rocks. Two north-and south-oriented watershed slopes having distinctly different vegetation biomass and active layer depth were used as natural proxy for predicting possible future climate changes occurring in this region. In addition, peat bog zone exhibiting totally different vegetation, hydrology and soil temperature regime has been studied.
   The isotopic composition of soil profile from Central Siberia is rather constant with a delta Zn-66 value around 0.2 parts per thousand close to the value of various basalts. Zn isotopic composition in mosses (Sphagnum fuscum and Pleurozium schreberi) exhibits differences between surface layers presenting values from 0.14 to 0.2 parts per thousand and bottom layers presenting significantly higher values (0.5 - 0.7 parts per thousand) than the underlain mineral surface. The humification of both dead moss and larch needles leads to retain the fraction where Zn bound most strongly thus releasing the lighter isotopes in solution and preserving the heavy isotopes in the humification products, in general accord with previous experimental and modeling works [GCA 75:7632-7643, 2011].
   The larch (Larix gmelinii) from North and South-facing slopes is enriched in heavy isotopes compared to soil reservoir while larch from Sphagnum peatbog is enriched in light isotopes. This difference may result from stronger complexation of Zn by organic ligands and humification products in the peat bog compared to mineral surfaces in North- and South-facing slope.
   During the course of the growing period, Zn followed the behavior of macronutrients with a decrease of concentration from June to September. During this period, an enrichment of larch needles by heavier Zn isotopes is observed in the various habitats. We suggest that the increase of the depth of rooting zone, and the decrease of DOC and Zn concentration in soil solution from the root uptake zone with progressively thawing soil could provoke heavy isotopes to become more available for the larch roots at the end of the vegetative season compared to the beginning of the season, because the decrease of DOC will facilitate the uptake of heavy isotope as it will be less retained in strong organic complexes.

TI The response of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the ecosystem carbon

AB Climate change has been proposed as a driver of carbon (C) loss from the large pool of C held in soils. Aqueous (dissolved organic carbon, DOC) and gaseous (soil respiration or net ecosystem CO(2) exchange) forms of C loss from soils have been considered. Under some climate change scenarios, gaseous emissions of C have been predicted to result in terrestrial ecosystems becoming a net source of C by 2050. Indeed, both forms of C loss have been linked to climate-related changes, such as warming and/or changes in precipitation. In our field-based drought manipulation experiment on an upland moorland in northeast Wales, we have carried out an annual drought treatment for 8 years, reducing levels of annual rainfall by 23% on average (1999-2007) through the use of automated roofs, which prevent rain falling on experimental plots between June and September annually. Following 5 years of repeated summer drought, there was a 26% increase in concentrations of DOC in soil water in the mineral soil in the drought plots and this further increased to 52% after 8 years. A similar pattern was not observed in the organic soil horizons. Despite higher DOC concentrations in the mineral soil horizon, decreased drainage of water from the drought-treated soils resulted in an overall decrease of 9% in total DOC export. Calculating the carbon (C) balance for the below-ground component of the ecosystem reveals that DOC represents 3% of gross C export. Previous studies at the site have demonstrated large increases in soil respiration resulting from the repeated drought treatment. By including data presented here with other C fluxes and pool measurements from the site, we demonstrate that soil carbon is accumulating by 126 g C m(-2) year(-1) in the control plots, but decreasing by 18 g C m(-2) year(-1) in the drought plots. The repeated drought treatment has thus resulted in the ecosystem switching from a net sink for C into a net source.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater is fundamentally important with respect to biogeo-chemical reactions, global carbon cycling, heavy metal transport, water treatability and potability. One source of DOM to groundwater is from the transport of organic matter from the vadose zone by rainfall recharge. Changes in precipitation patterns associated with natural climate variability and climate change are expected to alter the load and character of organic matter released from these areas, which ultimately impacts on groundwater quality and DOM treatability. In order to investigate potential changes in groundwater DOM character after rainfall recharge, we sampled shallow groundwater from a coastal peat-rich sand aquifer in New South Wales, Australia, during an extended period of low precipitation (average daily precipitation rate < 1.6 mm day(-1) over the 8 months prior to sampling), and after two heavy precipitation events (84 mm day(-1) and 98 mm day(-1) respectively). We assess changes in DOM composition after correcting for dilution by a novel combination of two advanced analytical techniques: liquid chromatography organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and negative-ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). We also assess changes in water chemistry pre- and post-rainfall. Post-rainfall, we show that the dilution-corrected amount of highly aromatic DOM molecular formulae (i.e. those categorised into the groups polyphenolics and condensed aromatics) were 1.7 and 2.0 times higher respectively than in pre-rainfall samples. We attribute this to the flushing of peat-derived DOM from buried organic material into the groundwater. We also identify that periods of low precipitation can lead to low hydrophilic/HOC ratios in groundwater (median = 4.9, n = 14). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to compare the HOC fraction with FT-ICR MS compound groups. We show that HOC has a more aromatic character in pre-rainfall samples, and is less similar to the aromatic groups in post-rainfall samples. This suggests that the decline in water-borne hydrophobics observed post-rainfall could be associated with preferential adsorption of the hydrophobic aromatic DOM, making post-rainfall samples less treatable for potable water supply. Post-rainfall we also observe significant increases in arsenic (leading to concentrations greater than 3 times the World Health Organisation drinking water limit of 10 mu g/ L). Increases in coastal rainfall due to climate change may therefore alter the composition of groundwater DOM in coastal peatland areas in ways that may impact DOM bioavailability, and increase arsenic concentrations, reducing the ease of water treatment for human consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the chemical and molecular changes of shallow groundwater DOM pre-rainfall and post-rainfall in a sedimentary organic carbon rich environment through multiple analytical techniques.

AB To what extent did climate change steer the trajectories of early societies? The final prehistoric (Developed to Late Iron Age) and early medieval periods in Ireland witnessed several major transformations in settlement, economy, material culture and ideology. Here, we review the palaeoenvironmental records to contextualise these transformations in terms of both climate oscillations and land-use history to evaluate whether climate change may have played a role in altering the socio-economic or political framework. We find little evidence that climate change coincided with major cultural alterations in the archaeological record, with pollen records providing important insights into ongoing human activity during times of reduced archaeological visibility. Although palaeoenvironmental records rarely provide sufficient chronological resolution with which to test the effects of abrupt environmental changes on populations, we note no lasting impacts following the proposed downturns that would implicate climate as a determinant of enduring cultural change during these periods.

AB Natural organic matter poses an increasing challenge to water managers because of its potential adverse impacts on water treatment and distribution, and subsequently human health. Projections were made of impacts of climate change on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the primarily agricultural Boyne catchment which is used as a potable water supply in Ireland. The results indicated that excluding a potential rise in extreme precipitation, future projected loads are not dissimilar to those observed under current conditions This is because projected increases in DOC concentrations are offset by corresponding decreases in precipitation and hence river flow. However, the results presented assume no changes in land use and highlight the predicted increase in DOC loads from abstracted waters at water treatment plants. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils-including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost-than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.

AB Planet Earth is undergoing significant changes which are driven by natural and anthropogenic factors. However, it is difficult to identify the drivers and their effect on the environment and ecosystems because there are many interdependencies. In this study we present a multi-parameter approach to assess the effect of changes in human-induced and natural drivers on a wetland ecosystem. The study area is one of the most prominent European wetlands: the Biebrza Basin, located in north-eastern Poland. We analysed long-term (ca. 1960-2000) changes in meteorology, hydrology, soil and vegetation, and also conservation history. This approach enabled us to identify interactions between environmental change and management. We found significant trends (1960-2012) indicating climate change: increases in temperature, evapotranspiration and earlier start of spring floods. We identified (1970-2000) a shift towards drier vegetation types after drainage. However, we also found that restoration measures that were implemented have mitigated climate change effects and have led to increases in soil moisture and wetter vegetation types. We conclude that, if carried out sufficiently frequently, the management measures implemented in the Biebrza Basin, which are a combination of different restoration measures (blocking drainage, not clearing aquatic vegetation, bush removal, mowing), can to some extent mitigate the effects of climate change.

AB Earth system models (ESMs) are our primary tool for projecting future climate change, but their ability to represent small-scale land surface processes is currently limited. This is especially true for permafrost landscapes in which melting of excess ground ice and subsequent subsidence affect lateral processes which can substantially alter soil conditions and fluxes of heat, water, and carbon to the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate that dynamically changing microtopography and related lateral fluxes of snow, water, and heat can be represented through a tiling approach suitable for implementation in large-scale models, and we investigate which of these lateral processes are important to reproduce observed landscape evolution. Combining existing methods for representing excess ground ice, snow redistribution, and lateral water and energy fluxes in two coupled tiles, we show that the model approach can simulate observed degradation processes in two very different permafrost landscapes. We are able to simulate the transition from low-centered to high-centered polygons, when applied to polygonal tundra in the cold, continuous permafrost zone, which results in (i) a more realistic representation of soil conditions through drying of elevated features and wetting of lowered features with related changes in energy fluxes, (ii) up to 2 degrees C reduced average permafrost temperatures in the current (2000-2009) climate, (iii) delayed permafrost degradation in the future RCP4.5 scenario by several decades, and (iv) more rapid degradation through snow and soil water feedback mechanisms once subsidence starts. Applied to peat plateaus in the sporadic permafrost zone, the same two-tile system can represent an elevated peat plateau underlain by permafrost in a surrounding permafrost-free fen and its degradation in the future following a moderate warming scenario. These results demonstrate the importance of representing lateral fluxes to realistically simulate both the current permafrost state and its degradation trajectories as the climate continues to warm. Implementing laterally coupled tiles in ESMs could improve the representation of a range of permafrost processes, which is likely to impact the simulated magnitude and timing of the permafrost-carbon feedback.

AB The assessment of riverine fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and metals in surface waters of permafrost-affected regions is crucially important for constraining adequate models of ecosystem functioning under various climate change scenarios. In this regard, the largest permafrost peatland territory on the Earth, the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL) presents a unique opportunity of studying possible future changes in biogeochemical cycles because it lies within a south-north gradient of climate, vegetation, and permafrost that ranges from the permafrost-free boreal to the Arctic tundra with continuous permafrost at otherwise similar relief and bedrocks. By applying a "substituting space for time" scenario, the WSL south-north gradient may serve as a model for future changes due to permafrost boundary shift and climate warming. Here we measured export fluxes (yields) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), major cations, macro- and micro- nutrients, and trace elements in 32 rivers, draining the WSL across a latitudinal transect from the permafrost-free to the continuous permafrost zone. We aimed at quantifying the impact of climate warming (water temperature rise and permafrost boundary shift) on DOC, nutrient and metal in rivers using a "substituting space for time" approach. We demonstrate that, contrary to common expectations, the climate warming and permafrost thaw in the WSL will likely decrease the riverine export of organic C and many elements. Based on the latitudinal pattern of riverine export, in the case of a northward shift in the permafrost zones, the DOC, P, N, Si, Fe, divalent heavy metals, trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates are likely to decrease the yields by a factor of 2-5. The DIC, Ca, SO4, Sr, Ba, Mo, and U are likely to increase their yields by a factor of 2-3. Moreover, B, Li, K, Rb, Cs, N-NO3, Mg, Zn, As, Sb, Rb, and Cs may be weakly affected by the permafrost boundary migration (change of yield by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0). We conclude that modeling of C and element cycle in the Arctic and subarctic should be region-specific and that neglecting huge areas of permafrost peatlands might produce sizeable bias in our predictions of climate change impact.

AB Wilson, K. S. and Humphreys, E. R. 2010. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from Arctic mudboils. Can. J. Soil Sci. 90: 441-449. Climate change is expected to alter the Arctic's carbon (C) balance and changes in these C-rich ecosystems may contribute to a positive feedback on global climate change. Low-center mudboils, a form of patterned ground in the Arctic, are distinct landforms in which the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and soil has not been fully characterized, but which may have an important influence on the overall C balance of tundra ecosystems. Chamber systems were used to sample net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CO2 and CH4 effluxes along a 35-m transect intersecting two mudboils in a wet sedge fen in Canada's Southern Arctic (lat. 64 degrees 52'N, long. 111 degrees 34'W) during the summer months in 2008. Mudboil features gave rise to dramatic variations in vegetation, soil temperature and thaw depth, and soil organic matter content along this transect. Variations in NEE were driven by variations in the amount of vascular vegetation, while CO2 and CH4 effluxes were remarkably similar among the two mudboil (CO2 effluxes: 1.1 +/- 0.9 and 1.4 +/- 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); CH4 effluxes: 83.1 +/- 189.4 and 23.1 +/- 9.4 nmol m(-2) s(-1), +/-1 standard deviation) and the sedge fen (CO2 effluxes: 1.6 +/- 0.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); CH4 effluxes: 28.0 +/- 62.0 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) sampling areas. Vegetation appeared to play an important role in limiting temporal variations in CH4 effluxes through plant mediated transport in both mudboil and sedge fen sampling areas. One of the mudboils had negligible vascular plant colonization presumably due to more active frost heave processes. The relatively high CO2 and CH4 efflux in this mudboil area was speculated to be a result of growth and decomposition of cryptogamic organisms, inflow of dissolved organic C, and warmer soil temperatures.

AB Our suggestion that agriculture was temporarily abandoned for several centuries throughout much of mainland Britain after 3600 BC has provoked criticism, notably the claim by Bishop (2015) that we have missed continuity in Scotland. We demonstrate that firm evidence for widespread agriculture within the later Neolithic is still unproven. We trace the disappearance of cereals and the associated population collapse to a probable climatic shift that impacted the abundance of rainfall and lowered temperatures, thus affecting the reliability of cereals. Divergent strategies and patterns are identified on the Scottish Islands versus the mainland, which has more in common with England, Wales and Ireland. We argue that climate shocks disrupt existing subsistence patterns, to which varied responses are represented by divergent island and mainland patterns, both in the Late Neolithic and during the Early and Middle Bronze Age. Favourable climates encouraged population growth and subsistence innovation, such as at the start of the Neolithic and in the Beaker period.

AB A similar to 2200-year moisture history of the southern Altai Mountains (i.e., Chinese Altai) was established based on peat delta C-13(celluose) data obtained at Yushenkule (YSKL) Peat. Generally speaking, the moisture record from YSKL Peat exhibits a "cool-wet" DACP (Dark Age Cold Period from similar to 500 to similar to 800 CE), a "warm-dry" MWP (Medieval Warm Period from similar to 800 to similar to 1200 CE), a "cool-wet" LIA (Little Ice Age from similar to 1200 to similar to 1900 CE), and a "warm-dry" CWP (Current Warm Period since similar to 1900 CE). But, RWP (Roman Warm Period from prior to similar to 100 CE to similar to 500 CE) is an exception (i.e., "warm-wet"). If the heat-water combinations within those major temperature-change events are further examined, the "warm-dry/cool-wet" generalization collapses. The comparisons between the variations in the peat delta C-13(celluose)-based moisture obtained from YSKL Peat and the variations of reconstructed climatic variables in the referenced sequences suggest that the moisture variations in the Altai Mountains have been basically controlled by the precipitation that was primarily modulated by the NAO variations.

AB Climate, fire, and human activities strongly affected the development of vegetation communities during the Holocene, yet the relative importance of these individual factors remains unclear in many areas. This paper presents new multi-proxy records of environmental change for the Meshchera Lowlands (the central part of the East European Plain) during the Holocene. Changes in regional vegetation during the Mid- and Late Holocene were influenced by climate, fire regime and human impact, as indicated by pollen, plant macrofossil, charcoal and testate amoebae analysis from several peat cores, along with reconstruction of tree cover from pollen assemblages. Since 8500 cal yr BP, the vegetation history represented a series of consecutive phases of birch, birch -pine and pine-broadleaf forests, with introduction of spruce after 2500 cal yr BP. Maximal abundance of broadleaf tree species was detected from 4700 to 2000 cal yr BP. Vegetation dynamics were strongly influenced by human activity since 1400 cal yr BP. High fire frequency was recorded for the periods 8500-4500 cal yr BP and 35002000 cal yr BP, when the fire return interval varied from 40 to 80 years. Since 2000 cal yr BP, the fire return period exceeded 500 years suggesting a significant decline in fire frequency during the last two millennia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Simulation of climate change (summer drought) stimulated autotrophy in a stream draining a Welsh peatland. Biofilm autotrophic biomass (chlorophyll) increased by 145% and was correlated with an increased overall metabolic activity (r = 0.75, P < 0.05). Bacterial population densities were not significantly affected.
   2. The increased autotrophy was probably related to a decrease in the organic:inorganic ratio of nutrients released from the wetland to the stream.
   3. Bacterial reserves of poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) fell by 51%. Increased nitrate concentrations were inversely correlated with autotrophic diversity (r = -0.88, P < 0.001).
   4. The increased autotrophic biomass represents an increased nutrient supply for the higher trophic levels which could promote higher productivity within the stream ecosystem as a whole.
   5. The simulation also caused a cooler (11%, P < 0.01) streamflow from the drought-impacted wetland, which could mitigate against any adverse temperature-dependent effects of future climatic change.

AB Wetlands and their ability to mitigate climate change motivates restorative and protective action; however, scientific understanding of land-atmosphere interactions is restricted by our limited continuous observations of gaseous fluxes. Many wetlands are small in spatial scale and embedded in forested landscapes. Yet, little is known about how the relative sheltering of forests affects net carbon (C) and energy balance. Here, we analyze coterminous USGS and Ameriflux eddy covariance flux tower observations over 3 years in two shrub fens in Northern Wisconsin, one more sheltered (US-ALQ) than the other (US-Los). Unsurprisingly, the open site showed higher overall wind speeds. This should have implications for atmospheric fluxes in wetlands as wind-forced processes are essential in promoting gas exchange over water. While both sites had similar half-hourly net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) during daytime, there were significant differences in nighttime NEE, as well as in net radiation partitioning in early spring and late summer. Sensible heat (H) fluxes were smaller at the sheltered fen except for the months of July-September. In contrast, latent heat (LE) fluxes were higher in every month except July. Additionally, sheltered fen ecosystem respiration had a weaker linear correlation with air temperature (R: 0.08 vs. 0.57 for the open fen). Our work suggests that canopy sheltering does not cause significant differences in half-hourly NEE during the day, but rather the largest differences such as lower CO2 emissions occur at nighttime due to higher variance at very low wind speeds. Sheltering also influenced direction of air flow, mean wind speeds in day vs. night, energy balance, and sensible and latent heat fluxes. We discuss implications of these findings for wetland restoration.

AB Around 4000 cal yr BP, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) suffered a widespread demise across the British Isles. This paper presents new information about P. sylvestris populations found in the Welsh Marches (western central Britain), for which the long-term history and origins are poorly known. Two new pollen records were produced from the Lin Can Moss ombrotrophic bog (LM18) and the Breidden Hill pond (BH18). The LM18 peat core is supported by loss-on-ignition, humification analysis and radiocarbon dating. Lead concentrations were used to provide an estimated timeframe for the recent BH18 record. In contrast to many other Holocene pollen records from the British Isles, analysis of LM18 reveals that Scots pine grains were deposited continuously between c. 6900-300 cal yr BP, at frequencies of 0.3-5.4%. It is possible that individual Scots pine trees persisted through the wider demise on thin soils of steep drought-prone crags of hills or the fringes of lowland bogs in the Welsh Marches. At BH18, the record indicates a transition from broadleaved to mixed woodland, including conifer species introduced around AD 1850 including Picea and Pinus. The insights from BH18 suggest that the current populations may largely be the result of planting. Comparison of the LM18 findings with other regional pollen records highlights consistent patterns, including a Mid-Holocene maximum (ca. 7000 cal yr BP), long-term persistence at low pollen percentages and a Late-Holocene minimum (ca. 3000 cal yr BP). These distinctive trends encourage further studies on refugial areas for Scots pine in this region and elsewhere.

AB Paleoenvironmental data, including pollen and sediment analyses, radiocarbon ages, and tephra identifications of a core recovered from a fen, provide a ca. 16,500 C-14 yr B.P. record of late Quaternary vegetation and climate change in the Long Valley area of west-central Idaho. The fen was deglaciated prior to ca. 16,500 C-14 yr B.P., after which the pollen rain was dominated by Artemisia, suggesting that a cold, dry climate prevailed until ca. 12,200 C-14 yr B.P. From ca. 12,200 to 9750 C-14 yr B.P. temperatures gradually increased and a cool, moist climate similar to the present prevailed. During this period a closed spruce-pine forest surrounded the fen. This cool, moist climate was briefly interrupted by a dry and/or cold interval between ca. 10,800 and 10,400 C-14 yr B.P. that may be related to the Younger Dryas climatic oscillation. From ca. 9750 to 3200 C-14 yr B.P. the regional climate was significantly warmer and drier than at present and an open pine forest dominated the area around the fen. Maximum aridity occurred after the deposition of the Mazama tephra (ca. 6730 C-14 yr B.P.). After 3200 C-14 yr B.P. regional cooling brought cool, moist conditions to the area; the establishment of the modern montane forest around the fen and present-day cool and moist climate began at ca. 2000 C-14 yr B.P.

AB Alpine ecosystems are predicted to be severely affected by climate change. Cold, wet oceanic-alpine environments may also accumulate large total ecosystem carbon (C) pools, but have rarely been investigated. We assessed C pools and fluxes on a toposequence of oceanic-alpine habitats from blanket mire and boreal Calluna heath to Racomitrium heath, Nardus snowbed and alpine Calluna heath. We quantified C pools in vegetation and soils for each habitat and compared these with C inputs from net primary production (NPP) and outputs via decomposition, measured in a 3-year litter bag experiment. We also investigated principle drivers (temperature, moisture, community composition) of C pool and flux differences between habitats. Total ecosystem C pools were large; 11-26 kg C m(-2) in alpine habitats and 50 kg C m(-2) in blanket mire. Within the alpine zone C storage was greatest in the snowbed. Litter decomposition was slow in all habitats (k = 0.09-0.29 y(-1)) while NPP was within the range reported for continental alpine systems. C pool sizes and C fluxes did not vary consistently with altitude but reflected topographic gradients of temperature and moisture within the alpine zone. Oceanic-alpine ecosystems contain large stores of C which may be vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

AB Coastal wetlands are significant components of the coastal landscape with important roles in ecosystem service provision and mitigation of climate change. They are also likely to be the system most impacted by climate change, feeling the effects of sea levels rise, temperature increases and rainfall regime changes. Climate change impacts on estuarine coastal wetlands (mangroves, saltmarsh) have been thoroughly investigated; however, the impacts on coastal freshwater wetlands (CFWs) are relatively unknown. To explore the current knowledge of the impacts of climate change on CFWs globally, we undertook a systematic quantitative literature review of peer-reviewed published literature. We found surprisingly little research (110 papers of an initial 678), the majority of which was conducted in the USA, focusing on the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on CFW vegetation or sediment accretion processes. From this research, we know that SLR will lead to reduced productivity, reduced regeneration, and increased mortality in CFW vegetation but little is known regarding the effects of other climate change drivers. Sediment accretion is also not sufficient to keep pace with SLR in many CFWs and again the effects of other climate drivers have not been investigated. The combination of unhealthy vegetation communities and minimal gain in vertical elevation can result in a transition towards a vegetation community of salt-tolerant species but more research is required to understand this process.

AB The ability to evolve increased drought tolerance in response to climate change was investigated in the enchytraeid, Cognettia sphagnetorum. Populations exposed to reduced precipitation or increased night time temperature for more than six years were collected in mixed Calluna/grass heathland at the Mols Laboratory, Denmark. The level of prolonged drought and increased temperature corresponded to a predicted climate change scenario and has been applied since 1999. In autumn 2005, enchytraeids were sampled in 3 cm intervals down to 9 cm depth and total number, biomass, diversity and soil organic matter were determined. The drought treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the density and biomass of enchytraeids, as well as changes in the species composition. In total, five different genera were found at the site in all three treatments (control, temperature and drought). C. sphagnetorum was the dominant species, especially in the upper 0-3 cm, and was clearly affected by the drought treatment. C. sphagnetorum from all plots were cultured in the laboratory to rear second or third generation adults. Results showed that populations of drought treated plots had not developed an increased drought resistance compared to populations of control or warming plots even after several years of a putative severe selection. Lack of adaptive potential in C. sphagnetorum suggests that more frequent periods with drought in the future will have a very strong negative influence on enchytraeid density, biomass and diversity.

   PANAMA
AB The principal scenario concerning the potential effects of climate change on mangrove forest communities revolves around sealevel rise with emphases on coastal abandonment and inland retreat attributable to flooding and saline intrusion. However, at the decade to century scale, changes in precipitation and catchment runoff may be a more significant factor at the regional level. Specifically, for any given sealevel elevation it is hypothesized that reduced rainfall and runoff would necessarily result in higher salinity and greater seawater-sulfate exposure. This would likely be associated with decreased production and increased sediment organic matter decomposition leading to subsidence. In contrast, higher rainfall and runoff would result in reduced salinity and exposure to sulfate, and also increase the delivery of terrigenous nutrients. Consequently, mangrove production would increase and sediment elevations would be maintained. Support for this scenario derives from studies of the high production in saline mangrove impoundments which are depleted in seawater sulfate. This paper also examines other components of climate change, such as UVb, temperature, and storm frequency, and presents a suite of hypotheses and analytical protocols to encourage scientific discussion and testing.

AB Nutrient-poor organic soils under maritime grassland are often located in remote wet locations in the landscape. Leaving these soils without drainage maintenance often raise the water table but continuous management (grazing) means they could remain a source of carbon dioxide (CO2) while also turning into a small source of methane (CH4). Due to geographical and socio-economic reasons, removing these sites from agricultural production may be an option to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To test this hypothesis we measured GHG fluxes over a four year period, at a drained and a rewetted organic soil under grassland, which were both grazed for the first two years and not grazed for the following two years. Statistical response functions estimated for gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) were used to reconstruct annual CO2-C balances using site-specific models driven by soil temperature, solar radiation, soil water table (WT) and leaf area index (LAI). Annually, soil CO2 emissions were comparable when grazed, although the rewetted site had a lower net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) despite displaying higher CH4 emissions. Both sites have lower CO2 emissions than typical drained organic soils due to management practices: extensive grazing, no fertilisation and mean annual water tables above-25 cm. When grazing stopped, GPP and Reco increased dramatically driven by vigorous growth of vegetation at both sites. The shallow drained site remained a source of CO2 and small source of CH4 while the rewetted site became either neutral or a small sink of CO2 with decreased CH4 emissions compared to the grazing period. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were negligible at either site. Removing grazing significantly reduced the NECB at both sites but in terms of global warming potential (GWP), the greatest GHG mitigation was in the rewetted site which exerted a cooling effect in the second year after the management shift.

AB We tested the prediction that global warming has caused recent decreases in body weight (Bergmann's rule) and increases in wing length (Allen's rule) in 14 species of passerine birds at two localities in England: Wicken Fen (1968-2003) and Treswell Wood (1973-2003).
   Predicted long-term linear decreases in residual body weight occurred in four species: dunnocks (Wicken Fen), and great tits, blue tits and bullfinches (Treswell Wood). Non-linear decreases also occurred in reed warblers and blackcaps at Wicken Fen, which also had a surprising linear increase in residual body weight in blackbirds.
   Residual wing lengths increased linearly, as predicted, in six of seven species at Wicken Fen. Whereas there were non-linear long-term increases in wrens, dunnocks and blackbirds in Treswell Wood. Unexpected linear decreases also occurred in residual wing lengths in willow warblers (Wicken Fen), and blue tits, great tits and chaffinches (Treswell Wood).
   The most parsimonious explanation for such long-term changes in body weight is global warming, as predicted by Bergmann's rule. Greater site and species-specific effects on wing length (e.g. non-linear changes plus shorter wings in the woodland habitat) suggest a less straightforward conclusion concerning Allen's rule, probably because wing length involved variation in both bone and feather growth.
   Changes in residual body weights and wing lengths often differed between species and were sometimes non-linear, perhaps reflecting short-term modifications in selection pressures. Human-induced influences are discussed, such as avian predator population densities and land-use change. Short-term variation in temperature had little effect, but rainfall did explain the unusual increase in blackbird body weight, possibly as a result of improving food (earthworm) availability.

AB This map of dominant vegetation types in Svalbard includes polygons of 15 map units in addition to glaciated areas and the 200 and 400 in contour lines. All units are differentiated according to mean July temperature ranges of 2 degrees C, corresponding to the major bioclimatic units within the Arctic. This makes the map particularly relevant to climate change studies. Most units are also differentiated according to soil chemistry and hydrology. In addition, four units are defined according to manuring, aridity and substrate instability. Three of the map units represent the zonal vegetation of the three major bioclimatic units present in Svalbard.
   The map shows the following units which are rare on a circumpolar scale and concentrated to Svalbard: High arctic Potentilla pulchella steppes, high-arctic acidic fens, high arctic alkaline Poa alpina snow beds, Deschampsia alpina mires, moss tundras below bird cliffs, polar desert moss tundras, and acidic polar desert on granite. This represents a strong biogeographic and conservation aspect of the map, and emphasizes the Norwegian conservation responsibility for these vegetation types. The CAvm TEAM (2003) map defined most units circumpolarly, and did not focus on regional aspects. A comparison with the latter map which is on the scale 1 :7.5 mill., also shows that more gradients, and a more complete cover of climatic and edaphic differentiations can be obtained by improving the scale to 1: 3.5 mill.

AB Climate warming is expected to have a large impact on plant species composition and productivity in northern latitude ecosystems. Warming can affect vegetation communities directly through temperature effects on plant growth and indirectly through alteration of soil nutrient availability. In addition, warming can cause permafrost to thaw and thermokarst (ground subsidence) to develop, which can alter the structure of the ecosystem by altering hydrological patterns within a site. These multiple direct and indirect effects of permafrost thawing are difficult to simulate in experimental approaches that often manipulate only one or two factors. Here, we used a natural gradient approach with three sites to represent stages in the process of permafrost thawing and thermokarst. We found that vascular plant biomass shifted from graminoid-dominated tundra in the least disturbed site to shrub-dominated tundra at the oldest, most subsided site, whereas the intermediate site was co-dominated by both plant functional groups. Vascular plant productivity patterns followed the changes in biomass, whereas nonvascular moss productivity was especially important in the oldest, most subsided site. The coefficient of variation for soil moisture was higher in the oldest, most subsided site suggesting that in addition to more wet microsites, there were other microsites that were drier. Across all sites, graminoids preferred the cold, dry microsites whereas the moss and shrubs were associated with the warm, moist microsites. Total nitrogen contained in green plant biomass differed across sites, suggesting that there were increases in soil nitrogen availability where permafrost had thawed.

AB This study reconstructed the vegetation dynamics and associated climate change of the past similar to 4100 years based on the pollen data from a short peat core (i.e., KLSZ-2) in Kelashazi Peat (48.12 degrees N, 88.37 degrees E, 2422 m a.s.l.) in the Altai Mountains. The reconstructed vegetation and climate were then stacked with those from a longer peat core (i.e., KLSZ-1) to evaluate the vegetation dynamics and associated climate change of the entire Holocene and to examine the delta C-13(cellulose)- and delta O-18(cellulose)-based temperature reconstructions in the same peat. This study shows that vegetation in Kelashazi valley was dominated by alpine meadows before -8200 cal. yr BP, by taiga forests at similar to 8200-similar to 5600 cal. yr BP, and by an expansion of alpine meadows since similar to 5600 cal. yr BP. This study also examined the vegetation dynamics and associated climate in the context of the entire Altai Mountains and the surrounding areas. Our examination suggests that the forest expansion in high elevations was initiated when the temperature reached a threshold level during the early Holocene, and the forest expansion in low elevations (i.e., below the down treeline) was initiated when the moisture reached a threshold level during the middle Holocene or even late Holocene. It is also notable that the forest expansion at low elevations appears to have been longitude-dependent, i.e., time transgressive eastward. A possible mechanism to explain the longitude-dependency is that a gradual shrinking trend of the Siberian High linked to the Holocene increase in winter insolation allowed the domination of the water vapor-enriched Westerlies to gradually encroach eastward.

AB Permafrost affected soils are an important component of the Boreal, Subarctic, and Arctic ecosystems of Canada. These areas are undergoing accelerated rates of climate change and have been identified as being at high risk for thaw. Thaw will expose soil to warmer conditions that support increased decomposition rates, which in turn will affect short- and long-term carbon storage capacity and result in feedback to global climate. We present a tool in the form of a Bayesian belief network influence diagram that will allow policymakers and managers to understand how interacting factors contribute to permafrost thaw and resulting effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) production and climate feedback. A theoretical example of expected responses from an organic soil typical of the Hudson Plain region and a mineral soil typical in the Arctic region demonstrate variability in responses across different combinations of climate and soil conditions within Canada. Based on the network results, the Arctic has historically had higher probability of thaw, but the Hudson Plain has had higher probability of producing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Under past and current climate conditions, the Hudson Plain has, on a per unit area basis, contributed more to climate feedback than the Arctic. However, the gap in contribution between the two regions is likely to decrease as thaw progresses more rapidly in the Arctic than Hudson Plain region, resulting in strong positive feedback to climate warming from both regions. The flexible framework presented will be useful for (1) identifying future research priorities to reduce uncertainties in predictions, and (2) projecting the effects of climate change and management to better assess where mitigation and adaptation activities should be focused during land use planning.

AB Two previously proposed models relating the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition to environmental change in north-west Europe are critically re-examined in the light of accumulating palaeoenvironmental data, and a realistic appraisal of spatial and temporal resolution. The first deals with declining marine productivity in the western Baltic, and the other with a proposed shift to drier, more continental conditions across north-west Europe. Both models are found to be unsatisfactory, although the case for southern Scandinavia seems to hold greater potential, at least for this region. Problems arise in the spatial scale over which climate change models are intended to apply, and over poor chronological resolution. Understanding the extent and nature of climate change at the relevant period, c. 6000/5800 cal. BP, is far from straightforward, as is the chain of causality between this and the adoption of mixed farming as a way of life.

AB Understanding the impact of past climatic changes on landscape stability is crucial in order to predict and mitigate the effects of future changes. However, in arid and semi-arid environments, reconstructions are often hampered by a poor understanding of the relationship between sediment deposition and climate. We present here data from central Texas, a region that is sensitive to environmental change but has received relatively little attention. The study integrates a chronology of 29 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from six sedimentary sites in a range of depositional contexts with a 19 000 a climate record derived from pollen extracted from the adjacent Boriack Bog. By comparing the two records, we aimed to assess the relationship between climate change and geomorphic activity. Data show that extensive aeolian and colluvial deposition occurred during the mid to late Holocene, with sedimentation generally increasing during more arid phases. However, a number of depositional events on slopes were associated with moister episodes, and sediment was also deposited in a summit setting immediately after phases of increased precipitation. Linkages between climate change and geomorphic response were therefore complex, being controlled by both sediment supply and transport energy. The climatic fluctuations identified in the Boriack Bog record highlight the sensitivity of central Texas to environmental change, while disparities in conditions recorded between it and other palaeoenvironmental sites in the southern USA emphasise the need for further work in order to enhance understanding of landscape sedimentary response to climate.

AB Trends of the temperature variations recorded in delta(18)O in Hongyuan peat cellulose are similar to those recorded in delta(18)O of Jinchuan peat cellulose and in delta(18)O of Dunde ice core. Climate events have been identified to be globally homogeneous. Two notable climate transition periods have been detected in the past 6000 years, namely 4000 aBP with climate shifting from cold to warm and 1500 aBP with climate shifting from warm to relatively cold. Power spectrum analysis was performed to investigate the periodical signals in the delta(18)O time series. Topical periodicities of 1200-1087 a, 752 a, 444 a, 325 a, 213 a, 127-123 a, 88 a, 79 a were discovered, indicating an integrated influence on Hongyuan climate from solar, monsoon and ocean activities. Solar forcing has been addressed to be the main driving forcing of Hongyuan climate.

AB A multiproxy Lateglacial environmental record is presented for a ca. 3.5-m lacustrine sequence retrieved from a small basin (ca. 2km(2)) at Thomastown Bog in County Meath, Ireland. Sediment chemistry, pollen, chironomid and stable isotope data provide a detailed picture of catchment and lake system changes from the end of the last glacial (GS-2a) to the early Holocene that correspond closely to existing local and regional models of climate change. Concomitant adjustments in independent proxy records are matched to the NGRIP oxygen isotope curve giving 12 event-episodes ranging from major climatic shifts to lower amplitude, centennial- to sub-centennial-scale adjustments, including a previously unreported regressive period of landscape instability during the north-west European Rammelbeek Phase'. The study emphasizes the potential of palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from sediment chemistry where the sediment mixing system reflects autochthonous versus allochthonous inputs. The investigation also indicates problems of interpreting isotope data derived from bulk marl due to possible lag effects controlling the delivery of soil and groundwater and multiple sources of HCO3- (aq.). These research findings have implications for core site selection and for studies attempting to use stable isotopes for correlation purposes.

AB We present pollen and spore analysis from a peat-bog section from southwestern Isla de los Estados (Staaten Island), Tierra del Fuego to better understand late-Holocene environmental change in southernmost Patagonia. The island's position as the easternmost landmass at the southernmost of South America, places it squarely within the influence of the southern westerly winds (SWW) and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and so makes the island a unique location to document the palaeoecological response to climate change during the late Quaternary. We compare our Nothofagus pollen record from Bahia Franklin with other Nothofagus pollen records from Isla de los Estados and Tierra del Fuego. Nothofagus has been shown to respond to changes in mean annual temperature in the southern latitudes under cooler climate with little seasonality in precipitation. We also evaluate the correspondence between these changes in vegetation to other late-Holocene environmental proxies that include variations in sea surface temperature (SST) from the Beagle Channel and records of past glacier fluctuations. Our results show that low concentrations of Nothofagus pollen existed at Bahia Franklin at about 4000 cal yr BP. Climate ameliorated between ca. 3500 and 500 cal yr BP based on an increase in frequency and concentration values of Nothofagus and Drimys winteri. Between about 500 and 50 cal yr BP, the pollen record revealed a noticeable decline in the forest density. We interpret the decline in forest density in Isla de los Estados between 500 and 50 yr cal BP as a response to cold and windy conditions during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Our interpretation from our Nothofagus pollen record broadly agrees with regional cooling recorded in reconstructed SST of the Beagle Channel and with glacier expansion in the Fuegian Cordillera.

AB The suitability of overwintering habitat in response to temporal fluctuations in winter temperatures and water table position, and variability in timing and intensity of snowfall and rainfall is critical to informing management strategies for climate-sensitive species such as the Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus). Important subterranean conditions contributing to the suitability of overwintering habitat for S. catenatus includes the availability of an unflooded space and temperatures above 0 degrees C which is conceptualized as the resilience zone. Here, we show that the timing and duration of resilience zone loss varies between years and among sites in response to variable weather conditions. Peatland habitat occupied by snakes lost the resilience zone fewer times and for shorter durations than unconfirmed habitat. In some cases occupied habitat continuously provided a resilience zone, suggesting that snakes may only be able to tolerate short periods of unsuitable conditions. As expected, larger precipitation events resulted in greater reduction of the resilience zone size. In particular, rain on snow events resulted in the greatest change in resilience zone size and could increase the risk of mortality events. With extreme weather-related events predicted to increase with climate change, long-term conservation of climate-sensitive species should focus on protecting habitats that are naturally resilient to changing and variable weather conditions and identifying vulnerable habitats that would benefit from additional research on adaptive management strategies.

AB The Paris Agreement reflects the global endeavour to limit the increase of global average temperature to 2 degrees C, better 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels to prevent dangerous climate change. This requires that global anthropogenic net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are reduced to zero around 2050. The German Climate Protection Plan substantiates this goal and explicitly mentions peatlands, which make up 5 % of the total area under land use and emit 5.7 % of total annual greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. Based on inventory reporting and assumptions of land use change probability, we have developed emission reduction pathways for organic soils in Germany that on a national level comply with the IPCC 1.5 degrees C pathways. The more gradual pathway 1 requires the following interim (2030, 2040) and ultimate (2050) milestones: Cropland use stopped and all Cropland converted to Grassland by 2030; Water tables raised to the soil surface on 15 %/60 %/100 % of all Grassland, on 50 %/ 75 %/ 100 % of all Forest land, and ultimately on 2/3 of all Settlements and on 100 % of all Wetlands. Also a more direct pathway 2 without interim 'moist' water tables and the climate effect (radiative forcing) of different scenarios is presented.

AB High resolution palaeoenvironmental records in Far-Eastern Russia are rare, and the Kamchatka Peninsula is among the least studied areas of the region. This paper describes a record spanning the last ca. 11,000 yr, obtained from a bog in the southern part of Kamchatka. The radiocarbon dated core was analysed for pollen, testate amoebae, charcoal and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
   The vegetation during the early Holocene was dominated by grasses (Poaceae), birch (Betula) and heath (Ericaceae p. p.). Around 10,300 cal yr BP there was a substantial change in the vegetation cover to shrub alder (Alnus viridis s.I.) stands with sedges and ferns (Polypodiophyta) as well as herbs such as meadow rue (Thalictrum) in the understory. In the surroundings of Utka peatlands started to form. The variations in the vegetation cover were most probably caused by climatic changes. At the beginning of sediment accumulation, before 10,300 cal yr BP, the composition of the vegetation points to cooler summers and/or decreased annual precipitation. Around 10,300 cal yr BP, changes in vegetation occurred due to rising temperatures and/or changed water regimes. Increased abundancies of dry indicating testate amoebae after 9100 cal yr BP point to intermediate to dry soil conditions. Between 8600 and 7700 cal yr BP tree alder (Alnus incana) was widely spread at the site which probably indicates optimal environmental conditions. The tephra layer at 381-384.5 cm (ca. 8500 cal yr BP) produces a strong impact on the testate amoebae assemblages. At 7700 cal yr BP there was a sudden drop of A. incana in the local vegetation. From this time on, A. incana and also A. viridis decrease continuously whereas Betula gradually increases. The upper part of the sequence (after 6300 cal yr BP) shows higher abundancies of meadowsweet (Filipendula) and sweet gale (Myrica) pollen. After 6300 cal yr BP, changes in testate amoebae demonstrate variable soil moisture conditions at the site. Between 3700 and 1800 cal yr BP, wet conditions dominate as dry indicating testate amoebae decrease. After 1800 cal yr BP soil conditions become more variable again but this time with dry dominating testate amoebae.
   In contrast to surrounding regions, there is no evidence of trees such as spruce or larch growing in the surroundings of the site even though those trees are characteristic of many eastern Siberian sites. This difference might be because of the maritime influence of the Okhotsk Sea. Even dwarf pine (Pinus pumila), which is currently widely dispersed in northern Kamchatka, became part of the local vegetation only during the last 700 yr.

AB 1. Due to its novelty and scale, the EMBER project is a key study within the prescribed burning evidence base. However, it has several significant but overlooked methodological flaws.
   2. In this paper, we outline and discuss these flaws. In doing so, we aim to highlight the current paucity of evidence relating to prescribed burning impacts on ecosystem services within the British uplands.
   3. We show that the results of the EMBER project are currently unreliable because: it used a correlative space-for-time approach; treatments were located within geographically separate and environmentally distinct sites; environmental differences between sites and treatments were not accounted for during statistical analysis; and, peat surface temperature results are suggestive of measurement error.
   4. Policy Implications. Given the importance of the EMBER project, our findings suggest that (a) government agencies and policymakers need to re-examine the strengths and limitations of the prescribed burning evidence base; and, (b) future work needs to control for site-specific differences so that prescribed burning impacts on ecosystem services can be reliably identified.

AB Temperate forests can contain large numbers of wetlands located in areas of low relief and poor drainage. These wetlands can make a large contribution to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) load of streams and rivers draining the forests, as well as the exchange of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. We studied the carbon budget of a small wetland, located in Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada. The study wetland was the Pine Marten Brook site, a poor fen draining a mixed hardwood-softwood forest. We studied the loss of DOC from the wetland via the outlet stream from 1990 to 1999 and related this to climatic and hydrologic variables. We added the DOC export information to information from a previously published model describing CH4 and CO2 fluxes from the wetland as a function of precipitation and temperature, and generated a new synthesis of the major C losses from the wetland. We show that current annual C losses from this wetland amount to 0.6% of its total C mass. We then predicted that under climate changes caused by a doubling of atmospheric CO2 expected between 2040 and 2050, total C loss from the wetland will almost double to 1.1% of total biomass. This may convert this wetland from what we assume is currently a passive C storage area to an active source of greenhouse gases, Crown Copyright (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In patches of co-occurring species in natural plant communities, there is a finely poised balance between species in the ways in which they respond to prevailing moisture and temperature regimes. However, environmental change scenarios, in which temperature, moisture and ultraviolet-B radiation are suggested to increase, may favour one of the species. The imbalance is likely to occur at the levels of interactions between patches of the different species and at the shoot level when neighbouring shoots belong to different species. We increased temperature and UV-B in a two-way factorial experiment and increased water supply independently in two subarctic mire communities dominated by the mosses Sphagnum fuscum and Dicranum elongatum. The effects of simulated increase in UV-B were Studied using two separate radiation systems, i.e. a "square wave" system and a "modulated" system.
   When precipitation was enhanced, both species showed an increase in growth but this was not sustained beyond 5 mm per day. S.fuscum showed a 50% greater response to enhanced precipitation than did D. elongatum, as would be expected from their habitat preferences. Under ambient temperature, S.fuscum grew 67% faster than D. elongatum and this relative difference in response was maintained after one year under a temperature enhancement. The response by species over the winter period was moderated by their neighbours. S.fuscum growth was enhanced when it grew next to D. elongatum whereas D. elongatum grew better with neighbours of its own species. Increased temperature and UV-B radiation did not affect the interaction between the species.
   Although a balance was maintained between the two species over the short duration of the experiment, potential was shown for all imbalance to occur over longer periods and particularly if winter warming and precipitation Lire greater than those in summer.
   During the peak growing season 20% increased UV-B over ambient had a negative effect oil S. fuscum under increased temperature but there were no overall seasonal effects on either species, irrespective of method of UV supplementation.

AB Since 1988, there has been, on average, a 91% increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of UK lakes and streams in the Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN). Similar DOC increases have been observed in surface waters across much of Europe and North America. Much of the debate about the causes of rising DOC has, as in other studies relating to the carbon cycle, focused on factors related to climate change. Data from our peat-core experiments support an influence of climate on DOC, notably an increase in production with temperature under aerobic, and to a lesser extent anaerobic, conditions. However, we argue that climatic factors may not be the dominant drivers of DOC change. DOC solubility is suppressed by high soil water acidity and ionic strength, both of which have decreased as a result of declining sulphur deposition since the 1980s, augmented during the 1990s in the United Kingdom by a cyclical decline in sea-salt deposition. Our observational and experimental data demonstrate a clear, inverse and quantitatively important link between DOC and sulphate concentrations in soil solution. Statistical analysis of 11 AWMN lakes suggests that rising temperature, declining sulphur deposition and changing sea-salt loading can account for the majority of the observed DOC trend. This combination of evidence points to the changing chemical composition of atmospheric deposition, particularly the substantial reduction in anthropogenic sulphur emissions during the last 20 years, as a key cause of rising DOC. The implications of rising DOC export for the carbon cycle will be very different if linked primarily to decreasing acid deposition, rather than to changes in climate, suggesting that these systems may be recovering rather than destabilising.

TI Hydrologic response of a wetland to changing moisture conditions:
   Modeling effects of soil heterogeneity
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE

AB Prediction of the effects of external influences such as climate change on wetland systems requires the prediction of hydrologic effects. Because wetland soils are typically heterogeneous, it is particularly important to understand the extent and connectedness of hydraulically conductive soil units, since water flow may be concentrated in such units while bypassing others of lower conductivity. However, subsurface hydrologic models typically do not represent heterogeneity adequately, being limited by sparse parameterization of soil properties. Conventional techniques for mapping units of soil within wetlands are highly laborious, requiring soil coring and laboratory testing. As an alternative, we developed a portable piezocone driver and highly sensitive piezocone designed to map wetland soil units with centimeter-scale resolution in the vertical and meter-scale resolution in the horizontal dimension. This system successfully delineated several different layers of peat, sand, and limnetic sediments, and their degree of interconnectedness in an eight-meter-thick peat deposit. Monitoring of wetland response to precipitation, changes in stream stage, and overbank flooding was then used in conjunction with the piezocone data and a two-dimensional flow model to constrain the hydraulic properties of the soil units. Thus parameterized, a standard subsurface flow model was able to realistically simulate a variety of hydrologic processes relevant to climate change, including wetland-stream water exchange, the movement of wetland porewaters to the root zone of plants, and wetland desaturation under dry conditions.

AB To examine the potential influence of terrestrially derived DOM on the Baltic Sea, a year-long study of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was performed in three river catchments in Sweden. One catchment drains into the Bothnian Sea, while two southern catchments drain into the Baltic proper. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were positively correlated with discharge from forested catchments over the year. While the overall concentrations of DOC were several times higher in the southern two catchments, higher discharge in the northern catchment resulted in the annual loadings of DOC being on the same order of magnitude for all three catchments. Biological oxygen demand (BOD) was used as a proxy for the lability of carbon in the system. The range of BOD values was similar for all three catchments, however, the ratio of BOD to DOC (an indication of the labile fraction) in Ume river was four times higher than in the southern two catchments. Total annual BOD loading to the Baltic Sea was twice as high in the northern catchment than in the two southern catchments. Lower winter temperatures and preservation of organic matter in the northern catchment combined with an intense spring flood help to explain the higher concentrations of labile carbon in the northern catchment. Lower lability of DOM as well as higher colour in the southern catchments suggest that wetlands (i.e. peat bogs) may be the dominant source of DOM in these catchments, particularly in periods of low flow. With climate change expected to increase precipitation events and temperatures across the region, the supply and quality of DOM delivered to the Baltic Sea can also be expected to change. Our results indicate that DOM supply to the Baltic Sea from boreal rivers will be more stable throughout the year, and potentially have a lower bioavailability.

AB Greening of the Arctic due to climate warming may provide herbivores with richer food supplies, resulting in higher herbivore densities. In turn, this may cause changes in vegetation composition and ecosystem function. In 1982-1984, we studied the ecology of non-breeding moulting geese in Jameson Land, low Arctic East Greenland. By then, geese consumed most of the graminoid production in available moss fens, and it appeared that the geese had filled up the available habitat. In 2008, we revisited the area and found that the number of moulting geese and the temperature sum for June-July had tripled, while the above-ground biomass in a moss fen ungrazed by geese had more than doubled. In a goose-grazed fen, the overall plant composition was unchanged, but the frequency of graminoids had decreased and the area with dead vegetation and open spots had increased. We suggest that climate warming has lead to increased productivity, allowing for higher numbers of moulting geese. However, the reduction of vegetation cover by grazing may have longer term negative consequences for the number of geese the habitat can sustain.

   VARIABILITY
AB Canada's managed boreal forest, 54% of the nation's total boreal forest area, stores 28 Pg carbon (C) in biomass, dead organic matter, and soil pools. The net C balance is dominated by the difference of two large continuous fluxes: C uptake (net primary production) and release during decomposition (heterotrophic respiration). Additional releases of C can be high in years, or in areas, that experience large anthropogenic or natural disturbances. From 1990 to 2008, Canada's managed boreal forest has acted as C sink of 28 Tg C year(-1), removing CO2 from the atmosphere to replace the 17 Tg of C annually harvested and store an additional 11 Tg of C year-1 in ecosystem C pools. A large fraction (similar to 57%) of the C harvested since 1990 remains stored in wood products and solid waste disposal sites in Canada and abroad, replacing C emitted from the decay or burning of wood harvested prior to 1990 and contributing to net increases in product and landfill C pools. Wood product use has reduced emissions in other sectors by substituting for emission-intensive products (concrete, steel). The C balance of the unmanaged boreal forest is currently unknown. The future C balance of the Canadian boreal forest will affect the global atmospheric C budget and influence the mitigation efforts required to attain atmospheric CO2 stabilization targets. The single biggest threat to C stocks is human-caused climate change. Large C stocks have accumulated in the boreal because decomposition is limited by cold temperatures and often anoxic environments. Increases in temperatures and disturbance rates could result in a large net C source during the remainder of this century and beyond. Uncertainties about the impacts of global change remain high, but we emphasize the asymmetry of risk: sustained large-scale increases in productivity are unlikely to be of sufficient magnitude to offset higher emissions from increased disturbances and heterotrophic respiration. Reducing the uncertainties of the current and future C balance of Canada's 270 Mha of boreal forest requires addressing gaps in monitoring, observation, and quantification of forest C dynamics, with particular attention to 125 Mha of unmanaged boreal forest with extensive areas of deep organic soils, peatlands, and permafrost containing large quantities of C that are vulnerable to global warming.

AB Species-environment relationships were studied between the occurrence of 13 fish and lamprey species and 9 mainly map-based environmental variables of Finnish boreal small streams. A self-organizing map (SOM) analysis showed strong relationships between the fish species and environmental variables in a single model (explained variance 55.9%). Besides basic environmental variables such as altitude, catchment size, and mean temperature, land cover variables were also explored. A logistic regression analysis indicated that the occurrence probability of brown trout, Salmo trutta L., decreased with an increasing percentage of peatland ditch drainage in the upper catchment. Ninespine stickleback, Pungitius pungitius (L.), and three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus L., seemed to benefit from urban areas in the upper catchment. Discovered relationships between fish species occurrence and land-use attributes are encouraging for the development of fish-based bioassessment for small streams. The presented ordination of the fish species in the mean temperature gradient will help in predicting fish community responses to climate change.

AB Two 17,000-yr-old peat bog records from low-elevation sites in Tierra del Fuego (Harberton, 54 degrees 54'S) and southern Patagonia (Rio Rubens, 52 degrees 4'48 '' S) and one c. 14,000 cal yr BP record from the upper treeline in Tierra del Fuego (Paso Garibaldi, 54 degrees 43'S) were analyzed for pollen, charcoal, and plant macrofossils to reconstruct changes in regional and local vegetation, fire frequency, and bog hydrology, respectively. Past environmental changes in both lowland records and in the upper treeline record are interpreted in terms of variations in effective moisture. During the late-glacial period, effective moisture changes at both low and high-elevation sites were interpreted from comparable shifts between mesic herb-rich grasslands and arid Empetrum heath or shrub-grassland with abundant disturbance indicators. The late-glacial effective moisture changes were primarily driven by temperature changes. During the early Holocene, expansion of open Nothofagus woodlands in the lowlands in present-day areas of dense forest was related to a marked precipitation increase. However, precipitation must have remained highly variable with century-long periods of increased summer drought, as evidenced by repeated intervals when bogs dried out and fire frequency was high. Up-slope shifts of the Nothofagus forest Andean tundra ecotone at 11,000 and 9000 cal yr BP also appear to reflect precipitation increases. Precipitation variability, however, must not have affected the upper treeline environments as no fires were recorded and the present-day Nothofagus forest had become established after 9000 cal yr BP. Upper treeline apparently was below present from 8000 to 7000 and 2500 to c. 400 cal yr BP. During those times low-elevation environments did not register change which suggests that the upper treeline may have been affected by lower temperatures. After c. 5000 cal yr BP fires became rare in the lowlands, suggesting a shift to an equable precipitation regime with only minor intervals of summer drought. No simultaneous change was recorded at the upper treeline. Thus, for the late-glacial and early Holocene the upper and lower treeline environments apparently responded similarly to primarily moisture changes. Only during the mid- and late Holocene environmental changes at high and low elevations differed, suggesting responses to different climate signals, precipitation in the lowlands and temperature at high elevation.

AB This study considers three long records of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux from two catchments with peat-covered headwaters. The catchments vary in size from 11 to 818 km(2) and the records are at least 12 years old, with one record going back to 1965. The study compares both annual and monthly DOC flux records with a range of hydroclimatic indicators in order to test which component of droughts may contribute to increasing DOC flux. The study found that: (1) there was no significant correlation between any of the proposed drought variables and DOC flux in any of the study catchments over periods of up to 34 years; (2) the most important variable for explaining the DOC flux was the runoff from the catchments overlying a seasonal cycle and an underlying upward trend was present in some records; (3) the residual time-series, after removal of the best-fit models, showed no evidence of increased production after times of severe drought. The lack of any evidence for any additional biogeochemical reactions associated with drought supports evidence that DOC loss from peat is limited by its solubility and that its production is fast on the time-scale of runoff events.

AB Methane fluxes were measured in an area of ombrotrophic mire at the Migneint in North Wales. Measurements were made at approximately monthly intervals between August 1993 and August 1995. A marked seasonal change in emission rates was noted. Peaks of methane emission were observed in August 1993 (6.2 mg m(-2) d(-1)), September 1994 (6.0 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and June 1995 (5.5 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Minimum emission rates were recorded in March 1994 (0.8 mg m(-2) d(-1)) and March 1995 (1.4 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Nitrogen, in the form of ammonium and/or nitrate, was applied to plots on the mire surface. Between August 1993 and July 1994 application rates were equivalent to a 50 or 100% increase in N deposition. From August 1994 to August 1995 the application rates were equivalent to a 500 or 1000% increase in N deposition. These applications of nitrogen had no effect on the methane emission rates at any date, with the exception of the measurement from November 1994. No correlation was found between methane flux and either soil temperature or water table. We suggest that the state of the vegetation at the site may be important, either through the role of the plants in transport of methane, or as the source of the organic carbon that is the substrate for methanogenesis.

AB We investigated the spatial and temporal connectivity between concentrations of organic carbon in stream water and the soil carbon pool in a small ( 1.3 km(2)) upland catchment in NE Scotland by comparing downstream changes in dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) with spatial changes in the soil carbon pool. Stream water DOC concentrations increased downstream to reach a maximum in the center of the catchment and then decreased in the lower part of the catchment, a pattern that was linked to spatial changes in the soil carbon pool. Subcatchment analysis of the soil carbon pool and DOC export showed that the strong relationship between percent of peat coverage and stream water DOC in the upper part of the catchment did not hold farther downstream, where freely draining mineral soils become spatially more important. Temporal variations in stream water and soil water DOC concentrations in the central part of the catchment were studied using samples collected from two depths ( 0.20 - 0.45 m and 0.65 - 0.95 m) in the two most important soil types there ( histosols and fluvisols). Stream water DOC concentrations were only related to soil water DOC in shallow peat. DOC concentration in shallow peat and stream water were both positively correlated with temperature. Multivariate regression analysis showed that 55% of the variation in stream water DOC concentrations could be explained by a model including stream temperature, discharge, and soil solution DOC concentrations in the shallow histosols. We conclude that the linkage between stream water DOC concentrations and the soil C pool in the upper 1.5 km of the stream reach are likely to be driven by temperature-related DOC production in near-surface histosols. Farther downstream, this relationship between organic carbon in the soil and stream becomes weaker as other processes ( e. g., lower inputs from minerals soils and allochthonous within-stream processing of DOC) become more important.

AB Net methane (CH4) flux across the ecosystem-atmosphere boundary is governed by two counteracting processes, CH4 oxidation and production. Recent research on CH4 cycling has focused on net CH4 fluxes, however, the separate processes of CH4 oxidation and production may vary at local scales and respond differently to environmental change. Here, we separate CH4 oxidation and production, measured as emission, in situ using CH4 oxidation inhibition combined with a novel in situ (CH4)-C-13 labeling experiment to determine the rate of soil oxidation of atmospheric CH4. The study was conducted in a subarctic heath ecosystem with three characteristic plant community types: moist mixed species heath, dry Carex-dominated heath, and wet Eriophorum-dominated fen. We further explored the projected climate change effects of increased temperature and enhanced leaf litter input. The CH4 oxidation inhibition experiment revealed significant potential CH4 emission despite net CH4 uptake. Total CH4 oxidation and potential CH4 emission rates differed significantly between plant communities, demonstrating high local-scale variation in CH4 fluxes. Climate treatments did not affect CH4 oxidation rates, however, warming tended to increase potential CH4 emission, indicating that climate change may affect oxidation and production rates asymmetrically. Near-surface soil oxidation of atmospheric CH4 was successfully traced using C-13 stable isotope labeling in situ. CH4 oxidation rates ranged widely, yet preliminarily suggested some degree of substrate limitation. Accounting for the local-scale variation in CH4 fluxes and the relative importance of the separate processes of CH4 oxidation and production will contribute importantly to predicting changes in landscape-scale CH4 budgets and climate feedbacks.

AB Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the soil carbon cycle. The effects of a field-scale summer drought manipulation on extracellular litter and soil phenol oxidase activity, soluble phenolic compounds and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were examined for an upland Calluna heathland on a peaty podsol in North Wales. Litter and organic soil phenol oxidase activity was found to be positively correlated with moisture content. Thus in shallow organic soils, which are sensitive to drying during periods of low rainfall, drought may inhibit soil phenol oxidase activity as a result of water limitations. The release of soluble phenolic compounds and DOC from the droughted plots was found to be lowered during the drought period and elevated outside of the drought period. It is hypothesized that these changes may be a result of the reduced ability of extracellular phenol oxidases to process recalcitrant polyphenolic material under drought conditions. A drying incubation carried out with litter and soil cores from the same site suggests that extracellular phenol oxidase activity displays an optimal moisture level. This reconciled the observed water limitation of phenol oxidase activity at the heathland experimental site with previously observed stimulation of phenol oxidase activity by water table drawdown in deeper peats.

AB After giving an overview of climate change induced vegetation shifts in the Palearctic region in our previous paper, in this article we review literature available in Web of Science on North and South America. We study different geographical regions such as Canada, Alaska, California, Southwestern, Eastern and Southeastern USA, the Great Lakes region, the Great Plains, intermontane basins and plateaus, Rocky Mountains and the Cascades as well as Central and South America. We summarize main results of relevant field studies, experiments and model simulations. Predicted environmental changes include temperature increases, altering precipitation patterns, droughts, permafrost thaw and ground subsidence in arctic regions, enhanced El Nino Southern Oscillation, sea level rise, increasing salinity of the vadose zone, snowpack declines and various disturbances. All vegetation types are affected by these changes, to the most important phenomena belong e.g. reduction of arctic and alpine communities, decreasing area of taiga, shrub encroachment in tundra areas, northward expansion of the tree line, reduction in wetland areas, invasion, altering forest regeneration patterns, decrease in dominance of conifer species, increased cover of salt-tolerant plant species in tidal marshes, expansion of grassland, compositional and structural changes of grasslands and forests, drying up of bogs, landward migration of mangroves, savannification of forests, expansion of chaparral as well as upward migration of species in the mountains.

AB Seven peat and 40 dead wood remains (mountain birch) were sampled within and above the present treeline ecotone on two mountains (Rodjanoaivi, Koahppeloaivi/Staloskaidi) along the Tenojoki in northernmost Finnish Lapland. The oldest peat samples ('summit peats') date back to about 2000 yr BP. They accumulated during cool and increasingly humid climatic conditions. The other peat samples taken from wind-eroded peat remains on convex topography 60-100 m above the present tree limit are about 700-1300 years old. These peat layers developed during a phase of increasing Sphagnum peat formation. An eroded peat-covered Podzol that had developed under former tree stands with dwarfshrub vegetation in the understorey also reflects this climatic change. The oldest birch wood samples date from the same period. These and the many younger samples are evidence for a general treeline decline since the Holocene climatic optimum until present. As a result of the decline of the upper forest stands, the alpine zone has extended downslope and wind erosion has increased considerably in the former and present treeline ecotone, removing most of the peaty layers and top soils from wind-exposed topography. Whilst the cooling climate was the main factor triggering treeline retreat, episodic mass-outbreaks of the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata), particularly when coincident with cold summers, must also be taken into consideration as a factor that enhanced or accelerated treeline decline during this period. As is evidenced by the wood samples, forest decline continued into modern times when overgrazing by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) became an additional factor enhancing wind erosion and affecting the regeneration of birch in the present treeline ecotone.

AB Soil thawing can affect the turnover of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and their release into the atmosphere. However, little has been known about the release of C and N during the thawing of alpine soils in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This study investigated the effects of soil thawing on the release of CO2, CH4, and N2O from alpine peatland soils and alpine meadow soils through an indoor experiment and determined the changes in the dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved organic N (DON), NO3--N, NH4+-N, and NO2--N concentrations in the soils after soil thawing. The freeze-thaw treatments were performed by incubating the soil columns at mild (-5 degrees C) and severe (-15 degrees C) for 14 days, and then at 5 degrees C for 18 days. The control columns were incubated at 5 degrees C. During thawing, the cumulative CO2 emissions from the severely frozen alpine peatland soils and alpine meadow soils were 36 and 85 % higher than those from the control soils, and the cumulative N2O emissions were 3.9 and 5.8 times higher than those from the control soils. However, the thawing after mild freezing produced no significant effects. The two freezing temperatures significantly increased the release of CH4 from the alpine peatland soils, but the thawing of the severely frozen soils reduced the CH4 uptake of the alpine meadow soils by 27 %. After the severely frozen alpine peatland soils thawed, the concentrations of DOC, DON, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and NO2--N increased significantly, but NO2--N showed no significant changes for the alpine meadow soils. After thawing with mild freezing, DOC in the alpine peatland soils and NH4+-N, NO2--N, and DOC in the alpine meadow soils showed no significant changes. This study indicates that the potential for release of C and N from alpine soils during thawing periods strongly depends on the freezing temperature and soil types.

AB As global warming and climate change become perceived as significant, the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) stored in the earth's polar regions is considered a matter of concern. Here, we focused on exploiting GHGs to address potential global warming challenges in the north polar regions. In particular, we used CO2 as a soft oxidant to recover energy as syngas (CO and H-2) and to produce biochars from pyrolysis of peat moss. CO2 expedited homogeneous reaction with volatile matters from peat moss pyrolysis, and the mechanistic CO2 role resulted in the conversion of CO2 and peat moss to CO at >= 530 degrees C. Steel slag waste was then used as an ex situ catalyst to increase reaction kinetics, addressing the issue of the role of CO2 being limited to >= 530 degrees C, with the result where substantial H-2 and CO formation was achieved at a milder temperature. The porosity of biochars, a solid peat moss pyrolysis product, was modified in the presence of CO2, with a significant improvement in CO2 adsorption capacity compared to those achieved by N-2 pyrolysis. Therefore, CO2 has the potential to serve as an initial feedstock in sustainable biomass-to-energy applications and biochar production, mitigating atmospheric carbon concentrations.

AB Modeling and observation of ground temperature dynamics are the main tools for understanding current permafrost thermal regimes and projecting future thaw. Until recently, most studies on permafrost have focused on vertical ground heat fluxes. Groundwater can transport heat in both lateral and vertical directions but its influence on ground temperatures at local scales in permafrost environments is not well understood. In this study we combine field observations from a subarctic fen in the sporadic permafrost zone with numerical simulations of coupled water and thermal fluxes. At the Tavvavuoma study site in northern Sweden, ground temperature profiles and groundwater levels were observed in boreholes. These observations were used to set up one- and two-dimensional simulations down to 2 m depth across a gradient of permafrost conditions within and surrounding the fen. Two-dimensional scenarios representing the fen under various hydraulic gradients were developed to quantify the influence of groundwater flow on ground temperature. Our observations suggest that lateral groundwater flow significantly affects ground temperatures. This is corroborated by modeling results that show seasonal ground ice melts 1 month earlier when a lateral groundwater flux is present. Further, although the thermal regime may be dominated by vertically conducted heat fluxes during most of the year, isolated high groundwater flow rate events such as the spring freshet are potentially important for ground temperatures. As sporadic permafrost environments often contain substantial portions of unfrozen ground with active groundwater flow paths, knowledge of this heat transport mechanism is important for understanding permafrost dynamics in these environments.

AB This study investigated the influence of sea-level and climate changes on the decreased fluvial aggradation and subsequent widespread peat initiation in the middle to late-Holocene in the Ishikari lowland, which is a coastal floodplain formed in response to the postglacial sea-level change. By introducing a new approach to separately evaluate the rates of organic and clastic sediment input, we demonstrated that the peat began to form when the fluvial sedimentation rate was significantly decreased (less than 0.6 mm/yr), while plant macrofossil analysis suggested that lowering of water level is also important to the peat initiation. Such changes in sedimentary environment may be associated with the abrupt abandonment of crevasse splays. The concentrated ages of the peat initiation around 5600-5000, 4600-4300, and 4100-3600 cal. BP suggest that an allogenic control promoted the abandonment of crevasse splays, and different onset ages can be explained by different fluvial responses of the Ishikari River and its tributaries. The abandonment of crevasse splays could result from sea-level fall or decreased precipitation. While submillennial sea-level fluctuations coincident with the peat initiation have not been reported in coastal lowlands of Japan, the close comparison of the onset ages and decreased precipitation recorded in a stalagmite from China, which represents the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), suggests that decrease in precipitation led to the abandonment of crevasse splays. Our results may indicate that similar fluvial responses might be common in other coastal floodplains affected by the EASM.

AB The development of quantitative temperature reconstructions in regions of paleoclimate interest is an important step for providing reliable temperature estimates in that region. Fossil chironomid assemblages have been studied in Patagonia showing great promise for reconstructing paleotemperatures; however there is still a lack of robust temperature inference models in that area.
   To contribute to the understanding of climate change, a transfer function using chironomids preserved in 46 lakes in Chile and Argentina was developed. The best performing model to infer the mean air temperature of the warmest month was a 3-component WA-PLS model with a coefficient of correlation (r(jack)(2)) of 0.56, a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.69 degrees C and a maximum bias of 2.07 degrees C. This model was applied to the chironomids preserved in the sediment of the Huelmo mire (41 degrees 31'S, 73 degrees 00'W), in the lake district of northwestern Patagonia. The reconstruction showed several cold spells (one at 13,200 to 13,000 cal yr BP and a cooling trend between 12,600 and 11,500 cal yr BP) associated with the Younger Dryas and/or Huelmo-Mascardi Cold Reversal (HMCR). Our findings support climate models proposing fast acting inter-hemispheric coupling mechanisms including the recently proposed bipolar atmospheric and/or bipolar ocean teleconnections rather than a bipolar see-saw model.

AB Naturally-occurring wetlands perform such functions as flood control, pollution filtration, nutrient recycling, sediment accretion, groundwater recharge and water supply, erosion control, and plant and wildlife preservation. A large concentration of wetlands is located in Eastern Europe. A significant amount of Eastern European wetlands has been converted to agricultural use in the past, and remaining wetlands are subject to agricultural drainage. Drained wetlands are used as prime agriculture lands for a variety of food crops. Other agricultural uses of wetlands range from growing Phragmites australis (common reed) for thatch and livestock feed, to collecting peat for heating and cooking fuel. Altered hydrologic regimes due to global climate change could further exacerbate encroachment of agricultural land use into wetlands.
   The vulnerability and adaptation studies of the U.S. Country Studies Program are used to analyze where climate change impacts to agriculture may likewise impact wetland;areas. Scenarios indicate higher temperatures and greater evapotranspiration altering the hydrologic regime such that freshwater wetlands are potentially vulnerable in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, and Russia, and that coastal wetlands are at risk in Estonia. Runoff is identified as a key hydrological parameter affecting wetland function. Since wetland losses may increase as a result of climate-change-induced impacts to agriculture, precautionary management options are reviewed, such as establishing buffer areas, promoting sustainable uses of wetlands, and restoration of farmed or mined wetland areas. These options may reduce the extent of negative agricultural impacts on wetlands due to global climate change.

AB This article is a sequel to a word-model description of the ecosystem of sub-Antarctic Marion Island, published in this journal 30 years ago (Smith 1977). It expands on the qualitative considerations of patterns of energy flow and nutrient cycling presented in that paper, by providing quantitative information from subsequent research at the island. Primary production of the island's lowland plant communities is high on an annual basis, because the vegetation has a long growing season due to the lack of severely cold winters or drought. Daily productivity is actually low due to low radiation levels and a cool growing season. The vegetation is particularly efficient regarding its use of nutrients for its growth, but still requires substantial amounts of nutrients to support the high annual production. Seabirds and seals import large quantities of nutrients from the ocean when they breed and moult on the island. They markedly enhance soil and plant nutrient status in the areas in which they occur, and also in adjacent areas. However, by far the greater part of the island's inland vegetation is not directly influenced by birds or seals and most of the nutrients required for plant growth are provided by decomposition of plant litter and peat. Soil invertebrates are crucial facilitators of decomposition processes, which are otherwise restricted by low soil temperatures and high soil moisture contents. Introduced house mice have invaded almost all parts of the island and predate heavily on the invertebrates, thus affecting nutrient mineralisation. This threatens not only the functioning (lowered nutrient availability leading to slower plant growth and the production of a lower quality, more decomposition-recalcitrant plant litter), but also the structure (an altered balance between production and decomposition leads to a change in the relation between peat formation and degradation, which is an important determinant of vegetation succession) of the island's ecosystem. It is suggested that mice may also affect the island's ecology by predating on seabird chicks.

AB Soils of wetland ecosystems serve as a huge storage of organic carbon. Its decomposition and consequent release of CO2 into the atmosphere is highly affected by soil hydrology, and this release of CO2 may severely increase during future climate change. The aim of this study was to describe the immediate response of soil CO2 efflux to temperature and changes in water level. Soil CO2 efflux from a marsh, temperature and the water table were continuously measured in situ during a gradual decrease of the water table and its consequent rapid increase after heavy rain. CO2 efflux fluctuated as it followed diurnal changes in temperature. However, it showed an increasing trend as the water table decreased. After the rain, the water table rose above the soil surface and soil CO2 efflux dropped fast to nearly zero. A simple model based on soil temperature and water table level was created to estimate soil CO2 efflux. There was far better agreement between this model and measured data than with the widely used model based only on temperature. The results showed the importance of including the soil water conditions in models for estimating soil CO2 efflux at sites with a high water table level.

AB The history of climate change and related driving mechanisms of the Gonghe Basin, northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, was reconstructed in the Holocene epoch, based on the comprehensive analysis of multi-proxies consisting of magnetic susceptibility, grain size, and geochemical elements from eolian and peat deposits at different altitudes. The results indicate that Holocene climate change at different altitudes is both consistent and different: a synchronous record of an increased warm-humid phase (10.0-8.5 ka) and a cold phase around 8.2 ka in the Early Holocene; an optimal warm-humid condition in marginal mountains of the Gonghe Basin in the Mid-Holocene; and a gradual decline in temperature and humidity in the Late Holocene. The Gonghe Basin interior in the Mid-Holocene was relatively arid, with increased moisture in the Late Holocene. On this basis, we compared our results to the paleoclimatic record in the low-latitude Asian monsoonal region, which indicates that, in addition to the Asian summer monsoonal strength having influenced regional climate change, the upward and subsidence motion of airflow over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau induced by topographic conditions, evaporation, and the feedback effect by the substrate was also influential. The latter was especially important for spatial-temporal differences in Middle and Late Holocene climatic changes at different altitudes.

AB Climate change is projected to increase mean temperature of northern lakes by the end of the twenty-first century. To simulate this scenario, during 2004-2007 we imposed artificial mixing in Halsjarvi, a small, polyhumic, boreal lake in southern Finland, to increase the depth of the thermocline by similar to 1.5 m. The aims of the experiment were to evaluate potential effects of climate change on biogeochemical cycles, especially of mercury, and on food web structure, productivity and biodiversity in dystrophic lake ecosystems. Following the initial depression of the thermocline in the experimental lake, the methyl mercury (MeHg) concentration in small European perch (Perca fluviatlis L.) decreased and remained lower throughout the study. In contrast, perch in a nearby reference lake exhibited increased MeHg during the same period. The delta(15)N values of the muscle tissue of perch were similar in both lakes over the study period, suggesting that the trophic position of perch remained unchanged. However, delta(13)C values of perch became clearly more negative in Halsjarvi, probably due to the greater mixing of the water column that resulted in changes in the carbon sources for the food web. A marked decrease of epilimnetic MeHg concentrations recorded during the experiment was considered to be the main reason for the decreased MeHg concentrations in perch. The results suggest that oxygen-related changes induced by climate change will be more important than direct temperature changes for MeHg accumulation in fish in small humic lakes with persistent oxygen deficiency in the hypolimnion.

AB Smoldering combustion of natural organic layers like peatlands leads to the largest fires on Earth. Smoldering wildlfires may propagate slowly for several months, consuming organic matter and threatening to release ancient carbon stored deep in the soil. It has become a topic of global interest linked to ecosystem perturbations, carbon sequestration and climate change. Although experimental studies have revealed the main factors affecting ignition and spread of natural smoldering, there is little modeling work explaining these experiments. This study aims at bridging the gap by developing a numerical model of smoldering combustion spreading downwards through a column of organic soil. Two spreading fronts are considered, drying and combustion, fed by oxygen diffusion through the top ash layer. The model predicts the transient evolution of the temperature profiles in a vertical column, and the smoldering rate for organic soils with different properties. The role of moisture content, inorganic content, bulk density and heat of smoldering combustion in the critical conditions for self-sustained propagation is investigated. The simulation results show that the critical moisture content increases linearly with heat of smoldering combustion, decreases linearly with the inorganic content and decreases with organic bulk density. These results are consistent with previous experimental observations, indicating the model is capable for guiding further experimental studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands are predicted to experience lowered water tables due to permafrost degradation in the Tibetan Plateau. These changes may affect carbon cycle processes such as soil respiration (R-s). However, the magnitude, patterns and controls of R-s remain poorly understood in alpine wetlands with their distinct hydrological regimes. Here, we conducted a field study on R-s from 2012 to 2014 in three alpine ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau-fen, wet meadow and meadow-with soil water decreases along hydrological gradients. From 2012 to 2014, the annual R-s was 128.9-193.3 g C m(-2)yr(-1), 281.5-342.9 g C m(-2)yr(-1), and 663.4-709.1 g C m(-2)yr(-1) for the fen, wet meadow, and meadow, respectively. An abrupt increase in CO2 emissions was caused by the spring thawing of the frozen soil in the fen and wet meadow, contributing 20.4-37.6% and 13.2-17.4%, respectively, to the annual R-s. The diurnal variation in the R-s was site specific among the three ecosystems, with one peak at 1300 h in the fen and meadow and two peaks at 1300 h and 1900 h in the wet meadow. The temperature-independent components of the diurnal variation in R-s were generally explained by photosynthetically active radiation in the fen and wet meadow, but not in the meadow. The temperature sensitivity of the R-s (unconfounded Q(10)) varied significantly among the three ecosystems, with the highest values occurring in the wet meadow, implying that permafrost thaw-induced wetland drying from the fen to the wet meadow could enhance the response of CO2 emissions to climate warming but that further drying from the wet meadow to the meadow probably weakens the effect of warming on the R-s. Our study emphasized the important role of the hydrological regime in regulating the temporal variation in R-s and its response to climate warming.

AB Vast amounts of carbon are bound in both active layer and permafrost soils in the Arctic. As a consequence of climate warming, the depth of the active layer is increasing in size and permafrost soils are thawing. We hypothesize that pulses of biogenic volatile organic compounds are released from the near-surface active layer during spring, and during late summer season from thawing permafrost, while the subsequent biogeochemical processes occurring in thawed soils also lead to emissions. Biogenic volatile organic compounds are reactive gases that have both negative and positive climate forcing impacts when introduced to the Arctic atmosphere, and the knowledge of their emission magnitude and pattern is necessary to construct reliable climate models. However, it is unclear how different ecosystems and environmental factors such as drainage conditions upon permafrost thaw affect the emission and compound composition. Here we show that incubations of frozen B horizon of the active layer and permafrost soils collected from a High Arctic heath and fen release a range of biogenic volatile organic compounds upon thaw and during subsequent incubation experiments at temperatures of 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Meltwater drainage in the fen soils increased emission rates nine times, while having no effect in the drier heath soils. Emissions generally increased with temperature, and emission profiles for the fen soils were dominated by benzenoids and alkanes, while benzenoids, ketones, and alcohols dominated in heath soils. Our results emphasize that future changes affecting the drainage conditions of the Arctic tundra will have a large influence on volatile emissions from thawing permafrost soils - particularly in wetland/fen areas.

TI A 7500-year history of intentional fires and changing vegetation on the
   Soni Plateau, Central Japan, reconstructed from macroscopic charcoal and
   pollen records within mire sediment
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Macroscopic charcoal and pollen in mire sediments from the Soni Plateau, Central Japan, were evaluated to clarify intentional fire history and relationship between vegetation transition and anthropogenic fire or climate change. The sediments deposited in recent centuries, when fire probably occurred every year, include a number density of macroscopic charcoal fragments exceeding 100 fragments/cm(3). High charcoal abundances (>100 fragments/cm(3)) were also recognized in sediments deposited at similar to 7000 cal BP and from 1500 cal BP to the present. Sediments deposited between 7000 and 1500 cal BP have a low abundance of charcoal fragments (<100 fragments/cm(3), but mainly <20 fragments/cm(3)). These results, combined with the pollen record, indicate that during the period until 1500 cal BP (except for similar to 7000 cal BP), forests of Abies, Quercus, and Fagus developed in a largely fire-free environment in and around the plateau. In this period vegetation transition was mainly influenced by climate change as follows; between 7500 and 6500 cal BP deciduous broadleaf forest grew under cool-temperate conditions; between 6500 and 5500 cal BP evergreen broadleaf forest were expanded under warming; between 5500 and 1500 cal BP evergreen broadleaf forest were developed probably under warm conditions with much precipitation. Frequent fires during a short period at similar to 7000 cal BP, probably due to human activities, possibly resulted in disturbance of forest, although Castanea forest subsequently developed across the plateau following this fire-prone period. After similar to 1500 cal BP (dated at least 1000 cal BP), periodic intentional fires resulted in the development and persistence of grassland dominated by Gramineae. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB A sediment core from a high-elevation bog on Maui in the Hawaiian Islands contains evidence for drier conditions between 9.4-5.8 kyr BP, followed by a wetter interval between 5.8-2.2 kyr BP, and a variable late Holocene. These precipitation changes may be a reflection of vertical displacements of the upper boundary of the mid-Pacific Trade Wind Inversion (TWI) cloud layer. Fires, probably volcanically ignited, occurred in the forests prior to human arrival. Polynesian activity in this high-elevation, remote site was apparently limited, with no pollen, charcoal, or sedimentological evidence for local anthropogenic disturbance. After European contact, grass fires increased and introduced plant species invaded the site. Values for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in sediments throughout the Holocene indicate low trace-metal deposition from atmospheric particulates at the site, even in the twentieth century.

AB Mangrove forests have survived a number of catastrophic climate events since first appearing along the shores of the Tethys Sea during the late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary. The existence of mangrove peat deposits worldwide attests to past episodes of local and regional extinction, primarily in response to abrupt, rapid rises in sea level. Occupying a harsh margin between land and sea, most mangrove plants and associated organisms are predisposed to be either resilient or resistant to most environmental change. Based on the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts, mangrove forests along arid coasts, in subsiding river deltas, and on many islands are predicted to decline in area, structural complexity, and/or in functionality, but mangroves will continue to expand polewards. It is highly likely that they will survive into the foreseeable future as sea level, global temperatures, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise.

AB Three permanent alpine springs and their associated pools in the Australian Alps were studied over a summer season to understand their hydrochemical function and characterise the (previously unreported) aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. These "source" pools represent an extremely limited habitat within Australian alpine peatlands and are likely vulnerable to groundwater flow changes associated with climate change. The pools provide an extremely stable habitat for 30 macroinvertebrate taxa in the harsh alpine environment with near chemostatic conditions and pool temperatures constrained to 5.6-6.3A degrees C despite air temperatures varying between -4.5A degrees C and 30.6A degrees C. Although small in area source pools have a significant effect on nitrate concentrations (decreases) and pH (increases) of waters flowing to downstream Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. The macroinvertebrate communities were distinctly different to that found in peatlands and headwater streams and were dominated by the amphipod Austrocrangonyx sp. (76.6% of total abundance), despite the low pH conditions (pH 5.27-5.56). Some of the macroinvertebrate taxa (Nannochorista, Anzacladius, and Parochlus) have a Gondwanan and circum-Antarctic distribution, similar to the bryophytes that also occur in these pools (Bartramia and Blindia). These source pools contribute to the diversity of alpine fauna and should be separately recognised and protected.

AB Mobilization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and related trace elements (TEs) from the frozen peat to surface waters in the permafrost zone is expected to enhance under ongoing permafrost thaw and active layer thickness (ALT) deepening in high-latitude regions. The interstitial soil solutions are efficient tracers of ongoing bio-geochemical processes in the critical zone and can help to decipher the intensity of carbon and metals migration from the soil to the rivers and further to the ocean. To this end, we collected, across a 640 km latitudinal transect of the sporadic to continuous permafrost zone of western Siberia peatlands, soil porewaters from 30 cm depth using suction cups and we analyzed DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and 40 major elements and TEs in 0.45 mu m filtered fraction of 80 soil porewaters.
   Despite an expected decrease in the intensity of DOC and TE mobilization from the soil and vegetation litter to the interstitial fluids with the increase in the permafrost coverage and a decrease in the annual temperature and ALT, the DOC and many major and trace elements did not exhibit any distinct decrease in concentration along the latitudinal transect from 62.2 to 67.4 degrees N. The DOC demonstrated a maximum of concentration at 66 degrees N, on the border of the discontinuous/continuous permafrost zone, whereas the DOC concentration in peat soil solutions from the continuous permafrost zone was equal to or higher than that in the sporadic/discontinuous permafrost zone. Moreover, a number of major (Ca, Mg) and trace (Al, Ti, Sr, Ga, rare earth elements (REEs), Zr, Hf, Th) elements exhibited an increasing, not decreasing, northward concentration trend. We hypothesize that the effects of temperature and thickness of the ALT are of secondary importance relative to the leaching capacity of peat, which is in turn controlled by the water saturation of the peat core. The water residence time in peat pores also plays a role in enriching the fluids in some elements: the DOC, V, Cu, Pb, REEs, and Th were a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 higher in mounds relative to hollows. As such, it is possible that the time of reaction between the peat and downward infiltrating waters essentially controls the degree of peat porewater enrichments in DOC and other solutes. A 2 degrees northward shift in the position of the permafrost boundaries may bring about a factor of 1.3 +/- 0.2 decrease in Ca, Mg, Sr, Al, Fe, Ti, Mn, Ni, Co, V, Zr, Hf, Th, and REE porewater concentration in continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, and a possible decrease in DOC, specific ultraviolet absorbency (SUVA), Ca, Mg, Fe, and Sr will not exceed 20% of their current values. The projected increase in ALT and vegetation density, northward migration of the permafrost boundary, or the change of hydrological regime is unlikely to modify chemical composition of peat porewater fluids larger than their natural variations within different micro-landscapes, i.e., within a factor of 2. The decrease in DOC and metal delivery to small rivers and lakes by peat soil leachate may also decrease the overall export of dissolved components from the continuous permafrost zone to the Arctic Ocean. This challenges the current paradigm on the increase in DOC export from the land to the ocean under climate warming in high latitudes.

AB Increased mineralization of the organic matter (OM) stored in permafrost is expected to constitute the largest additional global warming potential from terrestrial ecosystems exposed to a warmer climate. Chemical composition of permafrost OM is thought to be a key factor controlling the sensitivity of decomposition to warming. Our objective was to characterise OM from permafrost soils of the European Arctic: two mineral soils-Adventdalen, Svalbard, Norway and Vorkuta, northwest Russia-and a "palsa" (ice-cored peat mound patterning in heterogeneous permafrost landscapes) soil in Neiden, northern Norway, in terms of molecular composition and state of decomposition. At all sites, the OM stored in the permafrost was at an advanced stage of decomposition, although somewhat less so in the palsa peat. By comparing permafrost and active layers, we found no consistent effect of depth or permafrost on soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry across sites. The permafrost-affected palsa peat displayed better preservation of plant material in the deeper layer, as indicated by increasing contribution of lignin carbon to total carbon with depth, associated to decreasing acid (Ac) to aldehyde (Al) ratio of the syringyl (S) and vanillyl (V) units, and increasing S/V and contribution of plant-derived sugars. By contrast, in Adventdalen, the Ac/Al ratio of lignin and the Alkyl C to O-alkyl C ratio in the NMR spectra increased with depth, which suggests less oxidized SOM in the active layer compared to the permafrost layer. In Vorkuta, SOM characteristics in the permafrost profile did not change substantially with depth, probably due to mixing of soil layers by cryoturbation. The composition and state of decomposition of SOM appeared to be site-specific, in particular bound to the prevailing organic or mineral nature of soil when attempting to predict the SOM proneness to degradation. The occurrence of processes such as palsa formation in organic soils and cryoturbation should be considered when up-scaling and predicting the responses of OM to climate change in arctic soils.

AB The variability of the mild Irish climate is described. The effect of a slight rise in temperature is discussed as far as aquatic organisms are concerned. The effect is likely to be most marked on pelagic populations of marine organisms such as squid and also on intertidal animals. A rise in mean sea level is an indirect result of global warming, and this is likely to have an effect on estuarine organisms and mud flat dwellers. It is suggested that those organisms which are close to the southern limits of their distribution in Ireland may disappear from our fauna. Examples are given from earlier periods and from the present-day fauna. There is likely to be an expansion of the distribution of southern forms which at the moment are near the northern limit of their range. As far as terrestrial animals are concerned, the problem of whether the rainfall pattern will also change is discussed. The likely effects of this on parasite and free-living populations (including the fauna of temporary water bodies, common in West Ireland) are discussed. The complications introduced by diapause and related factors are considered. The fauna of peat bogs may be seriously affected and also those organisms dependent on certain food plants. The peculiar problems of Ireland in having so many empty niches is considered in relation to the increased dangers of accidental introductions.

AB Using data from a single upland peat catchment ( North Pennines, UK), this study combines descriptions of the uptake of carbon by primary productivity and input from both wet and dry deposition with descriptions of carbon release pathways: soil CO2 respiration, CH4 flux, particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and excess dissolved CO2. Each pathway is projected 10 years into the future based upon extrapolated changes in rainfall and temperature. The study shows that the catchment is presently a net source of carbon and that over a period of 10 years the catchment goes from a net source of 11.2 to 20.9 gC/m(2)/year. The probability that the catchment is a net sink of carbon decreases from 35 to 26% over the study period, i.e. upland peats are predicted to become an increasing source of carbon. With respect to carbon gases (CO2 + CH4), the catchment remains a net sink but this decreases from 15.9 to 11.2 gC/m2/year, given current trends the catchment will become a net source of carbon gases by 2034. For most pathways the predicted increases or decreases are in line with increasing temperature predicted for the area, but DOC flux shows a larger percentage increase because of additional production caused by the increased frequency of severe droughts within the catchment. If this result is extended across the UK uplands, peats would be a net source of between 0.26 and 0.45 Mt C/year, but with respect to carbon gases alone the catchment is net sink of between 0.35 and 0.23 Mt C/year.

AB More reliable assessments of nutrient export to surface waters and the Baltic Sea are required to achieve good ecological status of all water bodies. Previous nutrient export estimates have recently been questioned since they did not include the long-term impacts of drainage for forestry. We made new estimates of the total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P) and total organic carbon (TOC) export from forests to surface waters at different spatial scales in Finland. This was done by formulating statistical equations between streamwater concentrations and climate, soil, forest management and runoff variables and spatial data on catchment characteristics. The equations were based on a large, long-term runoff and streamwater quality dataset, which was collected from 28 pristine and 61 managed boreal forest catchments located around Finland. We found that the concentrations increased with temperature sum (TS), i.e. from north to south. Nitrogen, P and TOC concentrations increased with the proportion of drained areas in the catchment; those of N and TOC also increased with the proportion of peatlands. In contrast, with the increasing concentrations of N and TOC with time, P concentrations showed a decreasing trend over the last few decades. According to our estimates, altogether 47,300 Mg of N, 1780 Mg of P and 1814 Gg of TOC is transported from forest areas to surface waters in Finland. Forest management contributes 17% of the N export, 35% of the P export and 12% of the TOC export. Our new forest management export estimates for N and P are more than two times higher than the old estimates used by the environment authorities. The differences may be explained by the long-term impact of forest drainage. The spatial results indicate that peatland forests are hotspots for N, P and TOC export, especially in the river basins draining to the Gulf of Bothnia. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on pollen data of 274 samples from a 550-cm core at Kelashazi Peat in the southern Altai Mountains within China, we reconstructed the Holocene vegetation dynamics and climatic change. The pollen assemblages and the associated biome scores indicate that the vegetation in Kelashazi valley was dominated by alpine meadows during the early Holocene (before similar to 8.2 cal. kyr BP) and by taiga forests in the middle Holocene (similar to 8.2-similar to 5.6 cal. kyr BP) that was followed by an expansion of alpine meadows (similar to 5.6-similar to 3.2 cal. kyr BP). The pollen based temperature index-indicated thermal maximum lasting from similar to 8.0 to similar to 5.6 cal. kyr BP was consistent with temperature stack for 60-30 degrees N and the later onset warming at Kelashazi Peat was associated with the cooling influence of remnant ice sheets in the early Holocene. The pollen-based increasing moisture index curve from Kelashazi Peat is in a good agreement with the synthesized decreasing aridity index curve in low-elevation regions of the Altai Mountains and the surrounding areas during the data-overlapping period between similar to 12.0 and similar to 3.2 cal. kyr BP. The Holocene wetting trend at Kelashazi Peat might have resulted not only from the increasing trend of NAO-related winter precipitation but also from the increasing trend of AMO-modulated summer precipitation.

AB The Northern Hemisphere cooling event 8200 years ago is believed to represent the last known major freshwater pulse into the North Atlantic as a result of the final collapse of the North American Laurenticle ice sheet. This pulse of water is generally believed to have occurred independently of orbital variations and provides an analogue for predicted increases in high-latitude precipitation and ice melt as a result of anthropogenically driven future climate change. The precise timing, duration and magnitude of this event, however, are uncertain, with suggestions that the 100-yr meltwater sscooling formed part of a longer-term cold period in the early Holocene. Here we undertook a multiproxy, high-resolution investigation of a peat sequence at Dooagh, Achill Island, on the west coast of Ireland, to determine whether the 8200-year cold event impacted upon the terrestrial vegetation immediately 'downwind' of the proposed changes in the North Atlantic. We find clear evidence for an oscillation in the early Holocene using various measures of pollen, indicating a disruption in the vegetation leading to a grassland-dominated landscape, most probably driven by changes in precipitation rather than temperature. Radiocarbon dating was extremely problematic, however, with bulk peat samples systematically too young for the North Atlantic event, suggesting significant contamination from downward root penetration. The sustained disruption to vegetation over hundreds of years at Dooagh indicates the landscape was impacted by a long-term cooling event in the early Holocene, and not the single century length 8200-year meltwater event proposed in many other records in the North Atlantic region.

AB Identifying the landscape and climate factors that control nutrient export by rivers in high latitude regions is one of the main challenges for understanding the Arctic Ocean response to ongoing climate change. This is especially true for Western Siberian rivers, which are responsible for a significant part of freshwater and solutes delivery to the Arctic Ocean and are draining vast permafrost-affected areas most vulnerable to thaw. Forty-nine small- and medium-sized rivers (10-100,000 km(2)) were sampled along a 1700 km long N-S transect including both permafrost-affected and permafrost-free zones of the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL) in June and August 2015. The N, P, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively), particular organic carbon (POC), Si, Ca, K, Fe, and Mn were analyzed to assess the role of environmental parameters, such as temperature, runoff, latitude, permafrost, bogs, lake, and forest coverage on nutrient concentration. The size of the watershed had no influence on nutrient concentrations in the rivers. Bogs and lakes retained nutrients whereas forests supplied P, Si, K, Ca, DIC, and Mn to rivers. The river water temperature was negatively correlated with Si and positively correlated with Fe in permafrost-free rivers. In permafrost-bearing rivers, the decrease in T northward was coupled with significant increases in PO4, P-tot, NH4, pH, DIC, Si, Ca, and Mn. North of the permafrost boundary (61 degrees N), there was no difference in nutrient concentrations among permafrost zones (isolated, sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous). The climate warming in Western Siberia may lead to a permafrost boundary shift northward. Using a substituting space for time scenario, this may decrease or maintain the current levels of N, P, Si, K, Ca, DIC, and DOC concentrations in rivers of continuous permafrost zones compared to the present state. As a result, the export flux of nutrients by the small- and medium-sized rivers of the Western Siberian subarctic to the Arctic Ocean coastal zone may remain constant, or even decrease.

AB A Late glacial - Holocene palaeoecological record, constrained by a robust chronology, from a peat bog near Punta Burslem (54 degrees 54'S, 67 degrees 57'W) on Isla Navarino, southernmost Patagonia documents the shifts in intensity and focus of the Southern Westerly Winds (SWWs) at these high latitudes. Such long-term records are required to reconstruct and better understand the likely regional impacts of a poleward shift and intensification of the SWWs predicted under global warming scenarios. Deglaciation at Punta Burslem occurs sometime before c. 17,000 cal a BP, and the post glacial landscape is dominated by cold tolerant pioneer species. Nothofagus woodland is established by c. 12,250 cal a BP, this moisture sensitive vegetation type retreats in the early to mid-Holocene from c. 9700 to 7050 cal a BP reflecting an intense and sustained drier phase associated with a prolonged poleward contraction of the SWWs. After c. 6000 cal a BP there is a regional trend to cooler and wetter climate. However, we identify at least five periods of rapid climate change (RCC) leading to drier conditions at this southern extreme of Patagonia: c. 5350-4750 cal a BP, c.4300-3300 cal a BP, c. 2600-1850 cal a BP, c. 1350-1100 cal a BP and c. 550-350 cal a BP. From a synthesis of our Isla Navarino records and a latitudinal spread (34 degrees-64 degrees S) of multiproxy records it is proposed that these periods of RCC and relatively drier conditions indicate latitudinal shifts in the location and intensity of the SWWs in response to climatic warming leading to reduced precipitation at the southern margins of Patagonia.

AB Examination of temperature variations over the past century for Europe and the Arctic from northern Norway to Siberia suggests that variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation are associated with an increase in oceanicity in certain maritime regions. A southward depression of the treeline in favour of wet heaths, bogs and wetland tundra communities is also observed in northern oceanic environments. The physiological basis for this change in ecological succession from forest to bog is discussed in relation to the long-term effects of flooding on tree survival. The heightened values currently detected in the North Atlantic Oscillation Index, together with rising winter temperatures, and increased rainfall in many areas in northern Europe, presents an increasing risk of paludification with adverse consequences for forest regeneration, particularly in areas with oceanic climates. Climatic warming in oceanic areas may increase the area covered by bogs and, contrary to general expectations, lead to a retreat rather than an advance in the northern limit of the boreal forest. High water-table levels are not automatically detrimental to forest survival as can be seen in swamp, bottomland and mangrove forests. Consequently, the inhibitory effects of flooding on tree survival and regeneration in northern regions should not be uncritically accepted as merely due to high water levels. Evidence is discussed which suggests that physiological and ecological factors may interact to inhibit forest regeneration in habitats where there is a risk of prolonged winter-flooding combined with warmer winters and cool moist summers.

AB The Uinta Mountains lie along an important transition between major climate regimes and thus are sensitive to major climatic changes and consequent vegetation shifts. Two pollen cores from montane Uinta sites on the Utah-Wyoming border (Marsh lake Bog and Camp Bog, respectively) were used to analyze vegetation shifts from the latest Pleistocene through the Holocene. The records correspond with those from adjacent portions of the Rocky Mountains, all demonstrating a major shift from alpine steppe to open spruce parkland at similar to 11,7001-1,200 cal yr BP. A second major shift to lodgepole pine forest began at similar to 8400 cal yr BP at Marsh Lake Bog and could have been a direct response of the dominant species to warmer conditions and/or the result of subtle changes in the competitive hierarchy of tree species near a sensitive ecotone. The difference in the rate and full expression of lodgepole forest development (taking nearly 2000 years longer at Camp Bog) was probably due to a set of complex and local factors, such as cold air drainage and landscape position. Lodgepole pine forest persisted throughout the late Holocene and appears to be the long-term regional "climax" forest, rather than a seral habitat. Fire does not appear to have triggered the middle Holocene shift from spruce-dominated to lodgepole pine-dominated forests in this area but may have contributed to its long-term persistence to the present day.

AB The effect of severe drought on the biogeochemistry of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production has been proposed as a possible explanation of the widespread observed increase in the flux and concentration of DOC in sub-boreal catchments across the northern hemisphere. It compares the pattern and extent of DOC increases to the pattern and extent of severe droughts. It also considers the effect of the two most severe droughts during the period of the available DOC records and includes DOC records from 97 sites. This study derives five different drought severity indices and compares these to the observed increase in DOC over the 4-year period after each severe drought. The results show no visual correlation between drought indices and trends in either DOC concentration or flux. Decreasing DOC fluxes and concentrations were observed in the areas that had experienced severe droughts, even in peat-covered catchments. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple linear regressions, no consistent or significant pattern of DOC increase after severe drought could be distinguished. This study does not exclude a role for drought in causing the observed DOC increases, but it suggests that the role of drought in DOC is limited to some individual catchments or some peat-covered headwaters.

AB Modern climate change in Alaska has resulted in widespread thawing of permafrost, increased fire activity, and extensive changes in vegetation characteristics that have significant consequences for socioecological systems. Despite observations of the heightened sensitivity of these systems to change, there has not been a comprehensive assessment of factors that drive ecosystem changes throughout Alaska. Here we present research that improves our understanding of the main drivers of the spatiotemporal patterns of carbon dynamics using in situ observations, remote sensing data, and an array of modeling techniques. In the last 60 yr, Alaska has seen a large increase in mean annual air temperature (1.7 degrees C), with the greatest warming occurring over winter and spring. Warming trends are projected to continue throughout the 21st century and will likely result in landscape-level changes to ecosystem structure and function. Wetlands, mainly bogs and fens, which are currently estimated to cover 12.5% of the landscape, strongly influence exchange of methane between Alaska's ecosystems and the atmosphere and are expected to be affected by thawing permafrost and shifts in hydrology. Simulations suggest the current proportion of near-surface (within 1 m) and deep (within 5 m) permafrost extent will be reduced by 9-74% and 33-55% by the end of the 21st century, respectively. Since 2000, an average of 678 595 ha/yr was burned, more than twice the annual average during 1950-1999. The largest increase in fire activity is projected for the boreal forest, which could result in a reduction in late-successional spruce forest (8-44%) and an increase in early-successional deciduous forest (25-113%) that would mediate future fire activity and weaken permafrost stability in the region. Climate warming will also affect vegetation communities across arctic regions, where the coverage of deciduous forest could increase (223-620%), shrub tundra may increase (4-21%), and graminoid tundra might decrease (10-24%). This study sheds light on the sensitivity of Alaska's ecosystems to change that has the potential to significantly affect local and regional carbon balance, but more research is needed to improve estimates of land-surface and subsurface properties, and to better account for ecosystem dynamics affected by a myriad of biophysical factors and interactions.

AB [1] Mosses are an important component of the boreal forest, but little is known about their contribution to ecosystem carbon, water, and energy exchange. We studied the role of mosses in boreal forest evapotranspiration by conducting two experiments in a black spruce forest in Fairbanks, Alaska. Moss evaporation was measured using lysimeters filled with Hylocomium splendens or Sphagnum capillifolium. Microclimate and moisture content were varied by placing the lysimeters in different habitats ( dense forest, open forest, bog), and by manipulating the water supply (no water, natural rainfall, water added). Moss evaporation rates between 1 June and 8 September averaged 0.3, 0.9, and 1.5 mm day(-1) in the dense forest (Hylocomium), open forest (Hylocomium and Sphagnum), and bog ( Sphagnum) respectively. Assuming a total forest evapotranspiration rate of 2 mm day(-1), this study shows that moss evaporation contributes considerably to boreal black spruce forest evapotranspiration. Moss evaporation rates depended strongly on the openness of the forest and to a lesser degree on the density of the vascular plant canopy and on moss species. The strong influence of habitat suggests that microclimate is the primary factor determining moss evaporation rates. Hylocomium evaporation reacted strongly to experimental water additions, indicating that precipitation frequency is an important factor in addition to microclimate for this species. The large moss evaporation rates in this study suggest a potential cooling effect of mosses, of Sphagnum in particular.

AB Hong et al. (2000) claim to have demonstrated a direct link between Holocene solar variability and delta O-18 variations in a peat core from China. This comment suggests that the proposed link rests on an inferred relationship between delta O-18 and air temperature that requires validation; moreover, the chronological control is not adequate to support the correlations without some degree of unverifiable tuning. The interesting conclusions drawn by the authors thus require further testing before they can be accepted. The growing tendency to infer poorly constrained correlations with targets that reflect variability, whether of external forcing or widely accepted climate responses, can often be counter-productive, despite its long history in Quaternary science.

AB The vegetation of 107 study plots has been described twice, first in the 1960s and 1970s and then again in 1998 and 2003-2005, on the basis of phytosociological releves produced using the Braun-Blanquet method. In addition, soil studies were carried out in 2005 on the basis of soil-core sampling for chemical analysis. The research took in all of the natural types of forest wetlands to be met with in the study area. Phytosociological releves in the two repeat sets were obtained in line with the Braun-Blanquet method, while successional changes were analysed using DCA, on the basis of weighted average values for the species indicator values, analyses of the layer cover of phytocoenoses, number of species, and frequencies and cover of herb-layer vegetation. The analysis of vegetation in the two research periods shows that wetland habitat in the Bialowieza forest has been subject to successional processes conditioned by changes in the environment, i.e. desiccation through a lowering of the water table, and climatic changes inter alia entailing an increase in air temperature at the same time as amounts of precipitation have been falling. The reduced humidity of soils is leading to an accelerated process of peat decay, and hence to increased fertility and acidity of the soils. Changes in habitat conditions are bringing about major changes in both the floristic composition of the herb layer and the structure of the phytocoenoses in marshland and riparian forest habitats.

AB To predict the impacts of climate change, a better understanding is needed of the foundation species that build and maintain biogenic ecosystems. Spartina alterniflora Loisel (smooth cordgrass) is the dominant salt marsh-building plant along the US Atlantic coast. It maintains salt marsh elevation relative to sea level by the accumulation of aboveground biomass, which promotes sediment deposition and belowground biomass, which accretes as peat. Peat accumulation is particularly important in elevation maintenance at high latitudes where sediment supply tends to be limited. Latitudinal variation in S. alterniflora growth was quantified in eight salt marshes from Massachusetts to South Carolina. The hypothesis that allocation to aboveground and belowground biomass is phenotypically plastic was tested with transplant experiments among a subset of salt marshes along this gradient. Reciprocal transplants revealed that northern S. alterniflora decreased allocation to belowground biomass when grown in the south. Some northern plants also died when moved south, suggesting that northern S. alterniflora may be stressed by future warming. Southern plants that were moved north showed phenotypic plasticity in biomass allocation, but no mortality. Belowground biomass also decomposed more quickly in southern marshes. Our results suggest that warming will lead northern S. alterniflora to decrease belowground allocation and that belowground biomass will decompose more quickly, thus decreasing peat accumulation. Gradual temperature increases may allow for adaptation and acclimation, but our results suggest that warming will lower the ability of salt marshes to withstand sea-level rise.

AB In recent years, researchers studying historical climates have given an increasing amount of attention to the Yu-Xue-Fen-Cun record of the Qing Dynasty of China. These records play an important role in the quantitative reconstruction of the climate from the past 300years in China due to their uniform recording formats and measurement methods. As a result of collective effort, methods for climate reconstruction are constantly improving, and regions with reconstructed high-resolution historical climate data are expanding. This study reviews the features of the Yu-Xue-Fen-Cun record and summarizes the progress and primary results achieved over the past 20years. Studies showed that temperature variations over eastern China had three stages: a relatively cold phase in the 18th century, the coldest phase in the 19th century, and the warmest phase during and after the 20th century. However, the amplitudes between the maximum and minimum temperatures differed from 4.2 to 5.7 degrees C among different regions and sites. The variation in annual precipitation in North China showed an opposite phase to the Meiyu rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the periods of 1736-1767, 1916-1948, and after 1955, and a consistent phase in the periods of 1792-1836 and 1845-1885. The rainband regularly moved away from South China in early May to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in mid-June, and then finally arrived in North China in early July.

Considering Sanjiang Plain as the study area, this study explored the influence of land use change on soil water and heat transport and the future trend of surface water and heat transport. The effects of land use change on soil water and heat transport were revealed using observation data from the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences from the period of May 2016 to May 2017. The analysis found evident changes in the water and heat status of different land use types. During conversion from uplands to paddy fields, the surface soil moisture content increased, evapotranspiration increased by approximately 20%, surface infiltration decreased by about 50%, and surface heat flux increased. In a future climate change scenario, the change trend of soil water and heat condition was roughly consistent with the present situation, and the proportion of evapotranspiration of upland and paddy fields in precipitation decreased to 40% and 55%, respectively. These results can provide a theoretical basis for the rational utilization of land and water resources in Sanjiang Plain.

AB Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), diatoms, pollen, charcoal, loss-on-ignition (LOI), and nutrient elements in lake sediments were used to assess important factors controlling Holocene changes in the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, pCO(2), color and pH of lake water in three boreal forest lakes in northern Sweden. The results suggest that mire formation, fire frequency and humidity are the most important forcing factors on millennial timescales. Mires produce humic acids that become available to the lakes, whereas fires may reduce the pool of carbon in the catchments, and humidity controls the transportation of allochthonous carbon into the lakes. Vegetation development and temperature as sole factors are of minor importance for the TOC concentrations in these lakes on a millennial timescale. Two of the sites indicate that liming and possibly fish introduction and rotenone treatment in recent time has led to increased TOC, color and pH in the lake water, and changed the diatom community composition to an assemblage that has never been present before. Given the predicted climate change scenario that suggests a more humid climate, expanding mires and less frequent fires, our paleolimnological data suggest that TOC concentrations can be expected to increase in boreal forest lakes in the future. Since super-saturation and emission of CO2 from lakes is correlated to the TOC concentration of lake water, higher TOC concentrations may lead to increased emission of CO2 from lakes to the atmosphere.

AB Industrial development within Canada's boreal zone has increased in recent decades. Forest management activities, pulp and paper operations, electric power generation, mining, conventional oil and gas extraction, nonconventional oil sand development, and peat mining occur throughout the boreal zone with varying impacts on water resources. We review impacts of these industries on surface water, groundwater, and wetlands recognizing that heterogeneity in the dominance of different hydrologic processes (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and runoff generation) across the boreal zone influences the degree of impacts on water resources. Through the application of best management practices, forest certification programs, and science-based guidelines, timber, pulp and paper, and peat industries have reduced their impacts on water resources, although uncertainties remain about long-term recovery following disturbance. Hydroelectric power developments have moved toward reducing reservoir size and creating more natural flow regimes, although impacts of aging infrastructure and dam decommissioning is largely unknown. Mineral and metal mining industries have improved regulation and practices, but the legacy of abandoned mines across the boreal zone still presents an ongoing risk to water resources. Oil and gas industries, including non-conventional resources such as oil sands, is one of the largest industrial users of water and, while significant progress has been made in reducing water use, more work is needed to ensure the protection of water resources. All industries contribute to atmospheric deposition of pollutants that may eventually be released to downstream waters. Although most industrial sectors strive to improve their environmental performance with regards to water resources, disruptions to natural flow regimes and risks of degraded water quality exist at local to regional scales in the boreal zone. Addressing the emerging challenge of managing the expanding, intensifying, and cumulative effects of industries in conjunction with other stressors, such as climate change and atmospheric pollution, across the landscape will aid in preserving Canada's rich endowment of water resources.

AB The northern mid- to high-latitudes have the highest total number and area of lakes on Earth. Lake origins in these regions are diverse, but to a large extent coupled to glacial, permafrost, and peatland histories. The synthesis of 1207 northern lake initiation records presented here provides an analog for rapid landscape-level change in response to climate warming, and its subsequent attenuation by physical and biological feedback mechanisms. Our compilation reveals two peaks in northern lake formation, 13,200 and 10,400 years ago, both following rapid increases in North Atlantic air temperature. Placing our findings within the context of existing paleoenvironmental records, we suggest that solar insolation-driven changes in climate (temperature and water balance) that led to deglaciation and permafrost thaw likely contributed to high rates of northern lake formation during the last Deglacial period. However, further landscape development and stabilization dramatically reduced rates of lake formation beginning similar to 10,000 years ago. This suggests that temperature alone may not control future lake development; rather, multiple factors must align to enable a landscape to respond with an increase in lake area. We propose that land surfaces strongly geared toward increased lake formation were highly conditioned by glaciation. Thus, it is unlikely that warming this century will cause lake formation as rapid or as widespread as that during the last Deglacial period. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the boreal and subarctic zone, the moss and peat interactions with rainwater and snowmelt water in shallow surface ponds control the delivery of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and metal to the rivers and further to the Arctic Ocean. The transformation of peat and moss leachate by common aquatic microorganisms and the effect of temperature on DOM mineralization by heterotrophs remain poorly known that does not allow predicting the response of boreal aquatic system to ongoing climate change. We used experimental approach to quantify the impact of boreal aquatic bacteria P. reactans, and two culturable bacteria extracted from a thaw lake of the permafrost zone (Bolshezemelskaya tundra, NE Europe): Iodobacter sp. and cyanobacterial associate dominated by order Chroococcales (Synechococcus sp). The interaction of these bacterial cultures with nutrient-free peat and moss leachate was performed in order to (1) quantify the impact of temperature (4, 25 and 45 A degrees C) on peat leachate processing by heterotrophs; (2) compare the effect of heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacterial associate on moss and peat leachate chemical composition, and (3) quantify the DOC and metal concentration change during cyanobacterial growth on leachate from frozen and thawed peat horizon and moss biomass. The efficiency of peat DOM processing by two heterotrophs was not modified by temperature rise from 4 to 45 A degrees C. The DOC concentration decreased by a factor of 1.6 during 3 days of moss leachate reaction with Iodobacters sp. or cyanobacterial associate at 25 A degrees C. The SUVA(245) increased twofold suggesting an uptake of non-aromatic DOM by both microorganisms. The growth of cyanobacteria was absent on peat leachate but highly pronounced on moss leachate. This growth produced tenfold decrease in P concentration, a factor of 1.5-2.0 decrease in DOC, a factor of 4 and 100 decrease in Fe and Mn concentration, respectively. Adsorption of organic and organo-mineral colloids on bacterial cell surface was more important factor of element removal from organic leachates compared to intracellular assimilation and/or Fe oxyhydroxide precipitation. Overall, we demonstrate highly conservative behavior of peat leachate compared to moss leachate in the presence of culturable aquatic bacteria, a lack of any impact of heterotrophs on peat leachate and their weak impact on moss leachate. A very weak temperature impact on DOM processing by heterotrophs and lack of difference in the biodegradability of DOM from thawed and frozen peat horizons contradict the current paradigm that the warming of frozen OM and its leaching to inland waters will greatly affect microbial production and C cycle. Strong decrease in concentration of P, Fe and Mn in the moss leachate in the presence of cyanobacterial associate has straightforward application for understanding the development of thermokarst lakes and suggests that, in addition to P, Fe and Mn may become limiting micronutrients for phytoplankton bloom in thermokarst lakes.

AB Plant growth forms are widely used to predict the effects of environmental changes, such as climate warming and increased nitrogen deposition, on plant communities, and the consequences of species shifts for carbon and nutrient cycling. We investigated whether the relationship between growth forms and patterns in litter quality and decomposition are independent of environmental conditions and whether growth forms are as good as litter chemistry at predicting decomposability.
   We used a natural, latitudinal gradient in NW Europe as a spatial analogue for future increases in temperature and nitrogen availability. Our screening of 70 species typical of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands showed that leaf litters of Sphagnum mosses, evergreen and deciduous shrubs, graminoids and forbs differed significantly in litter chemistry and that the ranking of the growth forms was independent of the region for all litter chemistry variables. Differences among growth forms were usually larger than differences related to the environmental gradient.
   After 8 and 20 months incubation in outdoor, Sphagnum-based decomposition beds, growth forms generally differed in decomposability, but these patterns varied with latitude. Sphagnum litters decomposed slower than other litters in all regions, again explaining its high representation in organic deposits of peatlands. Forb litters generally decomposed fastest, while the differences among the other growth forms were small, particularly at higher latitudes.
   Multiple regression analyses showed that growth forms were better at predicting leaf litter decomposition than chemical variables in warm-temperate peatlands with a high N-load, but less so in the subarctic, low-N region.
   Our results indicate that environmental changes may be less important in determining ecosystem leaf litter chemistry directly than are their indirect effects through changes in the relative abundance of growth forms. However, climatic and nutritional constraints in high-latitude peatlands promote convergence towards nutrient-efficient plant traits, resulting in similar decomposition rates of vascular growth forms despite differences in litter chemistry. The usefulness of the growth-form concept in predicting plant community controls on ecosystem functioning is therefore somewhat limited.

AB An inventory of the dragonflies and damselflies (Insecta: Odonata) at the Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (LNWR) was conducted during the summer of 2003. Adult censuses and larval sampling at 32 wetland sites produced 10 dragonfly and 14 damselfly species that were resident in the refuge. In 2006, two additional species were added. The odonate fauna of LWNR consisted primarily of widespread, common species that are adapted to fishless lentic communities and tolerant of alkaline and impermanent water regimes. Enallagma annexum (Hagen), Enallagma boreale Selys, Lestes disjunctus Selys, Lestes congener Hagen, Sympetrum costiferum (Hagen), and Sympetrum internum Montgomery were the most abundant odonates at the refuge. The odonate communities of semipermanent, oligosaline ponds were the most diverse and included species of Aeshna, Anax, Libellula, Leucorrhinia, Sympetrum, Lestes, Coenagrion, Enallagma, Ischnura, and Nehalennia. Large polysaline lakes were inhabited only by Ischnura damula Calvert and four species of Enallagma. Seasonal ponds that remained flooded until mid-July produced large numbers of Sympetrum internum, Lestes disjunctus, and Lestes unguiculatus. Spring-fed bogs and fens supported several species that were rare at the refuge including Sympetrum danae (Sulzer), Sympetrum semicinctum Say, and Amphiagrion abbreviatum (Selys). Long-term monitoring of odonate diversity and abundance may be useful in tracking the effects of climate change in the prairie pothole region but must take into account yearly fluctuations due to variation in winter and summer precipitation.

AB Global climate variability is a well-documented fact: however, the human contribution to climate change is now being vigorously debated. Therefore, a better understanding of past natural climate variability may help to establish the actual anthropogenic contribution to the observed climatic trend. A variety of high-resolution proxies now exist for documenting climate variability that has occurred in the northern hemisphere over the last 10 ka. In contrast, high-resolution paleoclimate records are more limited for regions such as high altitudes in the Andes/South America. However, many regions of the Andes contain a rich, but as yet overlooked, paleoclimate archive in the form of thick peat deposited in situ by the Distichia plant. In our study, based on altitudinal transect from the Peruvian Andes, we found a statistically significant and strong relationship between the stable carbon isotope composition of Distichia and air temperature (R=0.92 p<0.01). We also confirmed good preservation of relative differences in the original stable carbon isotope composition in peat derived from this plant. Our calibration showed that a decrease of similar to 0.97 +/- 0.23 parts per thousand in the stable carbon isotope composition of Distichia peat reflects a 1 degrees C increase in mean air temperature of the growing seasons. This relationship can be used as a new high-resolution proxy for reconstruction of paleotemperature variations over the past several thousand years in the Andes Mountains based on Distichia peat cores.

AB It is not yet clear how soils are responding to a warming climate. A major study using the National Soil Inventory (NSI) of England and Wales reported large declines in soil carbon concentration across 11 land uses between 1978 and 2003 and concluded there was a link to climate change. However, a second, almost contemporary study, recorded no significant changes, raising the possibility that the reported declines were caused by changes in land use and management rather than by climate change. We have used space-for-time' substitution on the data from the initial NSI study, combined with changes in rainfall and temperature over the survey period, to determine the extent to which the declines in soil carbon observed in the second NSI study could be predicted from changes in climate. For organo-mineral and mineral soils, little (0-5%) of the observed decline in carbon concentration can be predicted from changes in climate. In contrast, 9-22% of the changes reported for organic soils in semi-natural habitats are consistent with changes in temperature and rainfall between the two NSI surveys. We also found that carbon concentration in organic soils in semi-natural habitats declines as temperatures exceed 7 degrees C, mirroring independent observations for the decline in bog and dense shrub moor vegetation as temperatures rise above 7 degrees C, and raising the possibility that climate change may influence soil carbon indirectly by changing vegetation cover, and hence litter quality.

AB Recently reported high-latitude warming has the potential to affect arctic ecosystem structure and function in the short and long term. Arctic ecosystems are known sources of atmospheric CH4, and recent CO2 flux measurements indicate that these ecosystems are now, at least regionally, net sources of atmospheric CO2. It appears that over the short term (decades to centuries), arctic ecosystems may represent a positive feedback on global atmospheric CO2 concentrations and associated greenhouse gas-induced climate change. In addition, short-term feedbacks may be large enough to affect both local and global surface temperatures. Over the long term, changes in the structure, function and composition of arctic ecosystems may increase C accumulation relatively more than the amount lost, thus restoring the sink status of arctic ecosystems.

AB There is a lack of information about the trophic position of enchytraeid species, and it is unknown whether their vertical distribution in the soil corresponds to different feeding strategies. This study, for the first time, employs radiocarbon techniques to investigate the in situ feeding behaviour of enchytraeids. Soil cores including the associated vegetation were taken from a cambic stagnohumic gley near the summit of Great Dun Fell (845 in) in 1996. Since enchytraeid populations are known to be affected by changes in temperature and moisture regimes in upland soils, additional sampling was carried out at the soil warming experiment at the same site. Soil cores were also taken from a blanket bog on Hard Hill (560 m) at Moor House National Nature Reserve in 1998. All cores were sliced in the field into five layers, each of 2 cm, to a total depth of 10 cm. A subsample of each layer was used for animal extraction, and a parallel soil sample was used for C-14 isotope analysis. Results indicate that enchytraeids assimilate carbon components which are predominantly of material that is ca. 5-10 years old. The vertical movements of the worms due to changing abiotic factors do not affect this as they show similar values at all depths. However, in response to warming, they could have changed their C source as a lower C-14 enrichment with depth was observed in the heated samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Determining the timing and impact of anthropogenic climate change in data-sparse regions is a considerable challenge. Arguably, nowhere is this more difficult than the Antarctic Peninsula and the subantarctic South Atlantic where observational records are relatively short but where high rates of warming have been experienced since records began. Here we interrogate recently developed monthly-resolved observational datasets from the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, and extend the records back using climate-sensitive peat growth over the past 6000 years. Investigating the subantarctic climate data with ERA-Interim and Twentieth Century Reanalysis, we find that a stepped increase in precipitation across the 1940s is related to a change in synoptic atmospheric circulation: a westward migration of quasi-permanent positive pressure anomalies in the South Atlantic has brought the subantarctic islands under the increased influence of meridional airflow associated with the Amundsen Sea Low. Analysis of three comprehensively multi-dated (using C-14 and Cs-137) peat sequences across the two islands demonstrates unprecedented growth rates since the mid-twentieth century relative to the last 6000 years. Comparison to observational and reconstructed sea surface temperatures suggests this change is linked to a warming tropical Pacific Ocean. Our results imply 'modern' South Atlantic atmospheric circulation has not been under this configuration for millennia.

AB A 600-year high-resolution pollen record from a peat core (FS-2010) on the Zoige Plateau was obtained to reconstruct vegetation and climate changes on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Surface pollen data reveal that vegetation differences are reflected in different modern pollen assemblages. Fossil pollen data indicate that alpine meadow was the dominant vegetation type on the Zoige Plateau during the Little Ice Age (LIA) from similar to 1400 to similar to 1900 AD. Pollen-based climatic reconstructions indicate climatic fluctuations during this period consistent with records from neighboring areas. Specifically, relatively "warm-wet" conditions persisted from similar to 1400 to similar to 1500 AD and similar to 1800 to similar to 1900 AD, but generally "cool-dry" conditions from similar to 1500 to similar to 1800 AD. The reconstructed temperature variations during the LIA (i.e., similar to 1400 to similar to 1900 AD) were attributed to variations in total solar irradiation. This study casts further doubt on the FG/MG (subalpine forest and shrub group/alpine meadow group) ratio as a reliable indicator of temperature reduction during the Current Warm Period (CWP; post similar to 1900 AD) due to significant anthropogenic impacts including deforestation and swamp drainage. The reconstructed patterns of precipitation in the Zoige Plateau including Flower Swamp are shown to be contingent on variations in the strength of the Asian Monsoon. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB The retreat of the glacier snouts in the Kerguelen islands is clearly related to the slight warming and the reduced precipitation over the last 25 years. Organic deposits sampled on the new deglaciated areas have been dated using C-14 method. Information on the ecological conditions that predominated during the formation of these peat deposits was assessed from their fossil diatom flora content. The range of the glacier fluctuations is discussed. Two warm period- are recognized, 10 000 and 5 000 yr B.P., respectively. A third period, 2 200-900 yr B.P., was characterised by small fluctuations of the glacier snouts. The current deglaciation, which began at the end of the Little Ice Age and decelerated 25 yr ago, is the mast important since the beginning of the holocene period.

AB We document the rapid transformation of one of the Earth's last remaining Arctic refugia, a change that is being driven by global warming. In stark contrast to the amplified warming observed throughout much of the Arctic, the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of subarctic Canada has maintained cool temperatures, largely due to the counteracting effects of persistent sea ice. However, since the mid-1990s, climate of the HBL has passed a tipping point, the pace and magnitude of which is exceptional even by Arctic standards, exceeding the range of regional long-term variability. Using high-resolution, palaeolimnological records of algal remains in dated lake sediment cores, we report that, within this short period of intense warming, striking biological changes have occurred in the region's freshwater ecosystems. The delayed and intense warming in this remote region provides a natural observatory for testing ecosystem resilience under a rapidly changing climate, in the absence of direct anthropogenic influences. The environmental repercussions of this climate change are of global significance, influencing the huge store of carbon in the region's extensive peatlands, the world's southern-most polar bear population that depends upon Hudson Bay sea ice and permafrost for survival, and native communities who rely on this landscape for sustenance.

TI Ecosystem sentinels for climate change? Evidence of wetland cover
   changes over the last 30 years in the tropical Andes

AB While the impacts of climate change on individual species and communities have been well documented there is little evidence on climate-mediated changes for entire ecosystems. Pristine alpine environments can provide unique insights into natural, physical and ecological response to climate change yet broad scale and long-term studies on these potential 'ecosystem sentinels' are scarce. We addressed this issue by examining cover changes of 1689 high-elevation wetlands (temporarily or perennial water-saturated grounds) in the Bolivian Cordillera Real, a region that has experienced significant warming and glacier melting over the last 30 years. We combined high spatial resolution satellite images from PLEIADES with the long-term images archive from LANDSAT to 1) examine environmental factors (e.g., glacier cover, wetland and watershed size) that affected wetland cover changes, and 2) identify wetlands' features that affect their vulnerability (using habitat drying as a proxy) in the face of climate change. Over the (1984-2011) period, our data showed an increasing trend in the mean wetland total area and number, mainly related to the appearance of wet grassland patches during the wetter years. Wetland cover also showed high inter-annual variability and their area for a given year was positively correlated to precipitation intensities in the three months prior to the image date. Also, round wetlands located in highly glacierized catchments were less prone to drying, while relatively small wetlands with irregularly shaped contours suffered the highest rates of drying over the last three decades. High Andean wetlands can therefore be considered as ecosystem sentinels for climate change, as they seem sensitive to glacier melting. Beyond the specific focus of this study, our work illustrates how satellite-based monitoring of ecosystem sentinels can help filling the lack of information on the ecological consequences of current and changing climate conditions, a common and crucial issue especially in less-developed countries.

AB Climate change is likely to be experienced differently at higher elevations than in lowland areas. Observations of recent change can increase understanding of how changes will be realised. We examined changes in temperature lapse rates and rainfall gradients between pairs of stations, lowland and upland, across the UK. Seasonal and annual changes were investigated, because there may well be shorter-term changes which are not reflected in the overall annual average. Significant changes in both temperature and rainfall were observed, but the pattern of changes was spatially and seasonally variable across the UK. In general, temperature changes were stronger in winter than in summer, and minima rose more than maxima in the uplands, whereas the changes were similar between minima and maxima in the lowlands. Most ( but not all) upland stations showed significant increases in rainfall totals in winter that were greater than those experienced in the nearby lowlands. However, variations in seasonal trends of lapse rates and rainfall gradients are sufficiently large to warrant concern about existing climate change projections and the downscaling of regional and global climate models. Specifically, analysis at an annual time scale may mask important seasonal patterns. For countries where the data network is dominated by lowland stations but a significant proportion of the landscape is upland, this poses a problem for estimating temperature change over a large proportion of the landscape. Given the lack of a consistent pattern of changes, we advocate an extension of climate monitoring in the uplands in order to detail ongoing climate change in the different upland areas.

AB The use of pollen analysis to reconstruct regional vegetation changes, and subsequently climate, is a common approach in paleoclimatic reconstruction. However, it is unclear whether or not vegetation exhibits a lagged response to climate change during shifts from rapid cooling to rapid warming. The Younger Dryas (YD) cold event, spanning the last glacial/Holocene transition, was a prominent abrupt climatic event. To investigate the vegetation response to climate change during the YD, we compared profiles of independent climatic indicators from the sediments of alpine Lake Gonghai, on the margin of the modern Asian summer monsoon, with a pollen record from the same site. Our aim was to assess the phase lag of vegetation change relative to independent climate proxies that would have responded near instantaneously to climate change. The results show that the vegetation changed synchronously with the climate proxies, and consequently, we conclude that vegetation succession around Lake Gonghai exhibited a nonlagged response to climate change during the YD. This result confirms that a previous pollen-based quantitative regional precipitation record from Lake Gonghai reliably depicts variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), especially its decreasing trend during the YD. This conclusion differs from that of related research on the Baxie loess section and Hani peat deposits. Also, we suggest that our findings provide an improved understanding of the likely response of the EASM during cooling intervals and that the YD is a useful analog for studying the response of vegetation to possible abrupt cooling events under future global warming scenarios.

AB High-resolution pollen and magnetic susceptibility (MS) analyses have been carried out on a sediment core taken from a high-elevation alpine bog area located in Sierra Nevada, southern Spain. The earliest part of the record, from 8200 to about 7000 cal yr BP, is characterized by the highest abundance of arboreal pollen and Pediastrum, indicating the warmest and wettest conditions in the area at that time. The pollen record shows a progressive aridification since 7000 cal yr BP that occurred in two steps, first shown by a decrease in Pinus, replaced by Poaceae from 7000 to 4600 cal yr BP and then by Cyperaceae, Artemisia and Amaranthaceae from 4600 to 1200 cal yr BP. Pediastrum also decreased progressively and totally disappeared at ca. 3000 yr ago. The progressive aridification is punctuated by periodically enhanced drought at ca. 6500, 5200 and 4000 cal yr BP that coincide in timing and duration with well-known dry events in the Mediterranean and other areas. Since 1200 cal yr BP, several changes are observed in the vegetation that probably indicate the high-impact of humans in the Sierra Nevada, with pasturing leading to nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of the bog, Pinus reforestation and Olea cultivation at lower elevations.

AB We have measured the land-atmosphere CO2 exchange using the eddy covariance technique in a high Arctic tundra heath in northeast Greenland (Zackenberg). On the basis of 11 years of measurements (2000-2010), it was found that snow cover dynamics was important for the CO2 exchange. The start of CO2 uptake period correlated significantly with timing of snowmelt. Furthermore, for years with deep and long-lasting snowpacks, the following springs showed increased CO2 emission rates. In the first part of the study period, there was an increase of approximately 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in both accumulated gross primary production (GPP) and CO2 sink strength during summer. However, in the last few years, there were no significant changes in GPP, whereas ecosystem respiration (R-eco) increased (8.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and ecosystem CO2 sink strength weakened (-4.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). It was found that temperature and temperature-related variables (maximum thaw depth and growing degree days) controlled the interannual variation in CO2 exchange. However, while R-eco showed a steady increase with temperature (5.8 g C m(-2) degrees C-1), the initial increase in GPP with temperature leveled off at the high end of observed temperature range. This suggests that future increases in temperature will weaken the ecosystem CO2 sink strength or even turn it into a CO2 source, depending on possible changes in vegetation structure and functioning as a response to a changing climate. If this trend is applicable also to other Arctic ecosystems, it will have implications for our current understanding of Arctic ecosystems dynamics.

AB In many boreal regions of Russia the past natural variability of forest fire activity remains largely undocumented, preventing accurate assessment of the impact of current climate warming on forest ecosystem dynamics. This study aims to reconstruct the Holocene fire history of the northern Ural mountain foothills, in the Komi Republic, based on analyses of charcoal particles from peatland deposits and coupled with dendrochronological investigations. The results show that there was a gradual increase in forest fire activity during the past 11,000 years. Between 11,000 and 5100 cal. yr BP, the mean fire return interval (FRI) oscillated between 600 and 200 years. During this period, regional data showed that cold temperature, humid climatic conditions, combined with steppe vegetation between 11,000-9000 cal. BP, and then the development of spruce-dominated forest between 9300 and 4600 cal. yr BP, were less conducive to fires. After 5100 cal. yr BP, a gradual increase in drought conditions through reduced precipitations, associated with the establishment of a Scots pine forest favored fire frequency, with a mean FRI under 200 years (range, 200-40 years). Nowadays (since CE 1500), human activity induces an unprecedented fire activity with a mean FRI below 100 years (range, 100-40 years).

   HISTORY
AB The mid-Holocene decline of Tsuga canadensis (hereafter Tsuga) populations across eastern North America is widely perceived as a synchronous event, driven by pests/pathogens, rapid climate change, or both. Pattern identification and causal attribution are hampered by low stratigraphic density of pollen-sampling and radiometric dates at most sites, and by absence of highly resolved, paired pollen and paleoclimate records from single sediment cores, where chronological order of climatic and vegetational changes can be assessed. We present an intensely sampled (contiguous 1-cm intervals) record of pollen and water table depth (inferred from testate amoebae) from a single core spanning the Tsuga decline at Irwin Smith Bog in Lower Michigan, with high-precision chronology. We also present an intensively sampled pollen record from Tower Lake in Upper Michigan. Both sites show high-magnitude fluctuations in Tsuga pollen percentages during the pre-decline maximum. The terminal decline is dated at both sites ca. 5000 cal yr BP, some 400 years later than estimates from other sites and data compilations. The terminal Tsuga decline was evidently heterochronous across its range. A transient decline ca. 5350 cal yr BP at both sites may correspond to the terminal decline at other sites in eastern North America. At Irwin Smith Bog, the terminal Tsuga decline preceded an abrupt and persistent decline in water table depths by; 200 years, suggesting the decline was not directly driven by abrupt climate change. The Tsuga decline may best be viewed as comprising at least three phases: a long-duration pre-decline maximum with high-magnitude and high-frequency fluctuations, followed by a terminal decline at individual sites, followed in turn by two millennia of persistently low Tsuga populations. These phases may not be causally linked, and may represent dynamics taking place at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Further progress toward understanding the phenomenon requires an expanded network of high-resolution pollen and paleoclimate chronologies.

AB A multi-proxy reconstruction of water depth, temperature and precipitation inferred from Cladocera, Chironomidae and pollen assemblages has been obtained from Swierczyna paleo-oxbow (central Poland) during the Younger Dryas (YD) and Early Holocene. Results suggest that the YD was relatively cold and comprised two main phases. The first (ca. 12,500-12,000 cal. yrs BP) is characterized by a continental climatic regime and a decrease in winter temperatures and precipitation but an increase in spring/summer precipitation. The second phase (ca. 12,000-11,500 cal. yrs BP) was more mild with a variable continental climate, an increase in summer and winter temperature, a lengthening of the growing season and increased annual precipitation. The reconstructed water level generally follows changes in spring and summer precipitation and length of growing season. The frequency and timing of hydroclimatic oscillations at Swierczyna show strong similarities to records from other sites in Europe. This confirms that oxbows and valley mire ecosystems respond to rapid climate change during the YD and Early Holocene. This study therefore brings new insights into the effects of climate changes on river environments, especially during the YD. We also discuss the limitations of water depth, temperature and precipitation reconstructions inferred from the studied biotic assemblages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Three wetland sediment sections from two different locations (core CL-4 in the Chollipo area, and trenches HS and HY in the Pyeongtaek area) in west-central Korea yield crucial information on the timing and spatial pattern of century-scale climatic changes and subsequent surficial responses during the Holocene. In the Chollipo area, a lake environment developed from 7360 to 5000 calibrated years before present (cal. yr BP), the deposition of organic materials increased from 5000 to 2600 cal. yr BP, and peatland have formed since 2600 cal. yr BP. In the Pyeongtaek area, fluvial sediment was deposited prior to about 7000 cal. yr BP. From 7000 cal. yr BP onward, thick peat sequences started to develop. These two patterns of surficial responses to climate change through the Holocene are different from one another. While this might be due to the dissimilarity in geomorphic conditions, the approximate simultaneity of the environmental changes in the two areas shows that they both can be correlated with major climatic changes. Two such areas that have undergone major changes indicate that the hydrological factors including precipitation and strength of water flow were most responsible for the landscape and geomorphic evolution. The upward trend in relative sea level also played a primary role for environmental change in the coastal areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial processes contribute largely to the greenhouse effect and climate change. One of these industries is the cement industry, which contributes around 8% of CO2 emissions caused by mankind. Two promising and interesting ways to reduce CO2 emission are the utilization of alternative cementitious materials and carbon capture and utilization through CO2 mineralization. In this study, peat-wood fly ashes from fluidized bed combustion were used as a construction material for mineral carbonation. A self hardening characteristic of this type of fly ash was utilized, and simultaneous carbonation and hydration reactions were studied. The study showed that fly ashes from the fluidized bed combustion of peat and wood could be used to capture and mineralize CO2 during hydration reactions. At the same time, CO2 could improve the strength of self-hardened fly ashes. One interesting future possibility is fly ash tile production at energy plants: fly ashes can be used to capture CO2 from flue gases, thus improving the strength of produced tiles.

AB The treeline ecotone in northern Finnish Lapland is characterized by a mosaic of sites with highly varying environmental conditions. Density, age structure, growth, and root systems of mountain birch seedlings (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii [Orlova] Hamet-Ahti) were Studied in different microsite classes (deflation, lichen heath, dwarf shrub heath, hummock, willow shrub, sedge mire). On wind-exposed convex topography characterized by shortage of Moisture and nutrients, seedling establishment is impeded, as is indicated by low seedling densities and lack of very Voting seedlings as well as by high rooting depths and root/shoot ratios of the few individuals. It, sedge mires, birch seedlings occasionally Occur in great numbers but die off at an early stage. Extremely shallow root systems point to anoxia as the main reason. Severe shoot damage is common to almost all saplings. This is likely due to grazing by reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus). As a result, height growth is suppressed even on sites with otherwise relatively suitable conditions (e.g. willow shrub sites). Future effects of climate change Which Could locally improve conditions for germination and establishment of birch young growth might be overridden by the effects of high reindeer density.

AB Since the 1990s, the territory of the Sumava National Park (Czech Republic) has faced significant changes in land cover, especially deforestation, in conjunction with several bark beetle disturbances and hurricane Kyrill in 2007. The aim of the study is to review the hydrological and climatic function of the forest and deforestation impacts on the landscape temperature. As a case study, surface temperature changes of the selected area of Sumava National Park from the satellite Landsat thermal data is presented from 1991 to 2016. At the sites with decayed forest, the surface temperature increased by 2-4 degrees C. Images from ground temperature measurements illustrate extreme temperature differences (similar to 35 degrees C) at locations where dead wood has not been removed; in the live forest, they are around 5 degrees C. Further, we show the increase in air temperature is associated with the decay of forest stands, including snow melting. The duration of the permanent snow cover on the mountaintops with the growing forest in the last four years is, on average, 11 days longer than the areas with decayed forest. The results show that the increase in surface temperature in the large area causes changes in the local climate and hydrological regime. These changes may have a negative impact on the surrounding ecosystems, including the Sumava wetlands and peat bogs belonging to the Ramsar sites.

AB The survival of peat meadows in the Netherlands is threatened by soil subsidence, less favourable conditions for farming and rising costs of water management. To support policy-making, a study examined possible future strategies for these meadows in the west of the Netherlands. Future scenarios with different water level strategies and climate scenarios were modelled with the SIMGRO regional hydrological model. The analysis focused on water level control strategies, in combination with subsurface drains, with the aim of reducing subsidence and minimising the water supply in dry periods. Subsurface drains were found to be a good measure to reduce subsidence, but more water had to be supplied. Based on the simulated water level control strategies an optimal scenario was found; it minimises the negative effects of the increased water supply. A scenario simulating the anticipated climate change appeared to have a great impact on the peat meadows. In the future the subsidence rate will increase and more water will have to be supplied to maintain the target surface water levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A cyclic behaviour in the intensity of maritime conditions which varies with the periodic behaviour of the North Atlantic oscillation has recently became apparent in the climatic record of northern Europe. Periodic increases in oceanicity are usually viewed as having a positive effect on plant survival, as milder winters, reduction of temperature extremes, low risk of exposure to frost, and freedom from drought reduce many aspects of environmental stress. However, warmer winters in maritime environments may also have a powerful influence in creating habitats that are unfavourable for many species. The dangers of long periods of soil saturation for overwintering plants, soaking injury to germinating seeds, premature bud burst in spring, depression of treelines by increased cloud cover and high lapse rates, as well as the constant leaching of soils, are all negative aspects of the maritime environment. Woody species in which root dormancy is delayed by mild winters are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of winter flooding. Subsequent re-exposure to oxygen as water tables fall in spring can aggravate flooding damage through post-anoxic injury, leading to severe dieback of anchoring roots. Soil leaching, particularly after human disturbance, can induce nutrient deficiencies and the establishment of oligotrophic communities with reduced productivity. Podzolization and iron pan formation have in the past facilitated the processes of paludification in oceanic regions. The resulting spread of bogs and acid moorlands can further reduce the potential for productivity in both agriculture and natural plant communities. Given the probability that current climatic trends may increase the degree of oceanicity in western and northern regions of Europe, the potentially negative consequences of such a climatic change need to be considered in relation to future ecological changes and their consequences for conservation and land use.

AB In this work we present the complicated situation of a faunistically and floristically valuable ecosystem of the Rakutowskie Lake wetlands complex, which is part of the Special Protection Area for Birds of Bota Rakutowskie (PLB40001) and Bota Kocieskie Habitats Directive Sites (PLH040031) included in the Natura 2000 network. Numerous ornithological observations have drawn our attention to the problem of rapidly progressing overgrowth of the lake and significant fluctuations in its water surface area. These fluctuations, especially in the spring period, significantly limit safe reproduction possibilities of very rare species of water-marsh birds. A multidirectional and comprehensive spectrum of research works allowed us to determine the genesis of the ecosystem and show that the shallow lake is undergoing the final stage in its evolution. The economic aspect of human activity (changes in land use and land development works) has contributed to serious degradation of the ecosystem. Climate changes observed in recent years (increased air temperature and, consequently, higher evaporation) additionally deepen and accelerate this process. The research made it possible to determine how the ecosystem functions today, but it is also an attempt to determine our predictions about its future.

AB [1] The rise in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere in recent decades has been taken as indicative of increased turnover of terrestrial carbon and in particular in the vital reserve of peat. Hypotheses for this rise have been hotly debated in the literature. This study proposes that, although trends in concentration have been the main focus of attention, it is trends in DOC flux that need to be examined to understand changes in terrestrial carbon storage. This study uses data from 208 rivers over the period 1975 - 2003 to calculate the trend of DOC flux from Great Britain. The DOC flux peaks at 1.68 Mt C/yr, or an export of 6.6 tonnes C/km(2)/ yr. The trend in flux is inconsistent with the pattern of atmospheric deposition, but regression analysis shows that the major control is hydrological throughput followed by an underlying upward, linear temporal trend. There is a small but significant effect ascribable to drought and storage effects. This suggests that there is additional biogeochemical production as a result of drought but that the overwhelming control in DOC flux is controlled by hydrological throughput overprinting an underlying increase in trend in DOC production. The underlying trend is consistent with increases in air temperature and or atmospheric CO2.

AB The history of colluvial events over the last 8500 years is reconstructed in three Norwegian alpine slope-foot mires fed by three independent debris-flow systems. Chronologies for each site are constructed based on 155 radiocarbon-dated peat samples. At the multimillennial scale, debris-flow activity was greatest during the transition from the Holocene Thermal Maximum to the late Holocene (c. 4300-2800 cal. BP) when debris-flow events occurred with a frequency of 1 in 33 years: two peaks in activity, characterized by 1 event in 14 years and 1 event in 25 years, were reached at the beginning and end of this interval, respectively. Least activity occurred during the Holocene Thermal Maximum from c. 8000 to 7100 cal. BP, with one event in 900 years. Eight distinct century- to millennial-scale phases of high debris-flow frequency (>3 events per 100 years) are identified at c. 8300-8000, 7100-7000, 4300-3700, 3200-2800, 2200-1900, 1500-1200, 800-700 and 300-0 cal. BP. Similarities in the records from the three sites suggest underlying climatic variations linked to the frequency of intense summer and autumn rainfall events M the primary meteorological trigger of slope failure in the source areas). Differences between the records reflect local site sensitivity to the initiation of debris-flow activity and the triggering of each subsequent debris-flow event. It is also inferred that each debris-flow system passes through multimillennial stages of at first increasing and later decreasing sensitivity as its source area expands. The climatic signals in the debris-flow record appear to differ in various respects from those derived from other precipitation-sensitive proxies from southern Norway (river floods, snow avalanches and glacier variations). Debris-flow records provide, therefore, complementary information relating to extreme climatic events and demonstrate instabilities in the Holocene landscape but provide little or no support for the concept of an increasing landscape impact of debris flows in response to global warming.

AB Hydrothermal processes are key components of permafrost dynamics and hydrological and carbon cycles in northern forest ecosystems. A forest hydrology model. ForHyM, was used to evaluate these processes by determining how the depth and duration of frost penetration into the soil would vary daily over the course of several decades. This was done for chosen upland/wetland conditions within the Mackenzie Plain south of Fort Simpson, where permafrost is currently sporadic to discontinuous. The model calculations were done using daily weather records from November 1963 to 2010, starting with a hypothetical no-frost condition within the soil and subsoil. Model performance was evaluated by comparing modeled and measured temperatures at different soil depths (upland and peat plateau modelling, R-2 = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). It was found that well-drained upland forests within the general area would experience deep and complete freeze thaw cycles each year. In contrast, poorly drained wetlands would develop gradually deepening permafrost that would at first stabilize in depth over the course of 10 to 20 y, with thaw depth limited to <1 m each year. However, recent increases in recorded air temperature (more so in winter than in summer) would destabilize the pennafrost layer, and this would especially occur in areas with insufficient surface insulation by local peat, moss, forest litter, and snow accumulations. These estimates are consistent with (i) reported thawing depths and the widening encroachment of collapse scars towards the poorly drained portions of the South Mackenzie Plain.

AB This study compared three estimates of carbon (C) contained both in the surface layer (0-30 cm) and the total soil pools at polygon and regional scales and the spatial distribution in the three prairie provinces of western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). The soil C estimates were based on data from (i) analysis of pedon data from both the Boreal Forest Transect Case Study (BFTCS) area and from a national-scale soil profile database; (ii) the Canadian Soil Organic Carbon Database (CSOCD), which uses expert estimation based on soil characteristics; and (iii) model simulations with the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS2). At the polygon scale, good agreement was found between the CSOCD and pedon (the first method) total soil carbon values. Slightly higher total soil carbon values obtained from BFTCS averaged pedon data (the first method), as indicated by the slope of the regression line, may be related to micro- and meso-scale geomorphic and microclimate influences that are not accounted for in the CSOCD. Regional estimates of organic C from these three approaches for upland forest soils ranged from 1.4 to 7.7 kg Cm(-2) for the surface layer and 6.2 to 27.4 kg Cm(-2) for the total soil. In general, the CBM-CFS2 simulated higher soil C content compared with the field observed and CSOCD soil C estimates, but showed similar patterns in the total soil C content for the different regions. The higher soil C content simulated with CBM-CFS2 arises in part because the modelled results include forest floor detritus pool components (such as coarse woody debris, which account for 4-12% of the total soil pool in the region) that are not included in the other estimates. The comparison between the simulated values (the third method) and the values obtained from the two empirical approaches (the first two methods) provided an independent test of CBM-CFS2 soil simulations for upland forests soils. The CSOCD yielded significantly higher C content for peatland soils than for upland soils, ranging from 14.6 to 28 kg Cm(-2) for the surface layer and 60 to 181 kg Cm(-2) for the total peat soil depth. All three approaches indicated higher soil carbon content in the boreal zone than in other regions (subarctic, grassland).

AB Amplification of global warming in Arctic and boreal regions is causing significant changes to permafrost-affected landscapes. The nature and extent of the change is complicated by ecological responses that take place across strong gradients in environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Emerging remote sensing techniques based on a growing array of satellite and airborne platforms that cover a wide range of spatial and temporal scales increasingly allow robust detection of changes in permafrost landscapes. In this review, we summarise recent developments (2010-15) in remote sensing applications to detect and monitor landscape changes involving surface temperatures, snow cover, topography, surface water, vegetation cover and structure, and disturbances from fire and human activities. We then focus on indicators of degrading permafrost, including thermokarst lakes and drained lake basins, thermokarst bogs and fens, thaw slumps and active-layer detachment slides, thermal erosion gullies, thermokarst pits and troughs, and coastal erosion and flooding. Our review highlights the expanding sensor capabilities, new image processing and multivariate analysis techniques, enhanced public access to data and increasingly long image archives that are facilitating novel insights into the multi-decadal dynamics of permafrost landscapes. Remote sensing methods that appear especially promising for change detection include: repeat light detection and ranging, interferometric synthetic aperture radar and airborne geophysics for detecting topographic and subsurface changes; temporally dense analyses at high spatial resolution; and multi-sensor data fusion. Remotely sensed data are also becoming used more frequently as driving parameters in permafrost model and mapping schemes. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Shore pine, which is a subspecies of lodgepole pine, was a widespread and dominant tree species in Southeast Alaska during the early Holocene. At present, the distribution of shore pine in Alaska is restricted to coastal bogs and fens, likely by competition with Sitka spruce and Western hemlock. Monitoring of permanent plots as part of the United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program identified a recent loss of shore pine biomass in Southeast Alaska. The apparent loss of shore pine is concerning, because its presence adds a vertical dimension to coastal wetlands, which are the richest plant communities of the coastal temperate rainforest in Alaska. In this study, we examined the shore pine tree-ring record from a newly established plot network throughout Southeast Alaska and explored climate-growth relationships. We found a steep decline in shore pine growth from the early 1960s to the present. Random Forest regression revealed a strong correlation between the decline in shore pine growth and the rise in growing season diurnal minimum air temperature. Warm summer nights, cool daytime temperatures and a reduced diurnal temperature range are associated with greater cloud cover in Southeast Alaska. This suite of conditions could lead to unfavorable tree carbon budgets (reduced daytime photosynthesis and greater nighttime respiration) and/or favor infection by foliar pathogens, such as Dothistroma needle blight, which has recently caused widespread tree mortality on lodgepole pine plantations in British Columbia. Further field study that includes experimental manipulation (e.g., fungicide application) will be necessary to identify the proximal cause(s) of the growth decline. In the meantime, we anticipate continuation of the shore pine growth decline in Southeast Alaska.

AB Precipitation amounts and patterns at high latitude sites have been predicted to change as a result of global climatic changes. We addressed vegetation responses to three years of experimentally increased summer precipitation in two previously unaddressed tundra types: Betula nana-dominated shrub tundra (northeast Siberia) and a dry Sphagnum fuscum-dominated bog (northern Sweden). Positive responses to approximately doubled ambient precipitation (an increase of 200 mm year(-1)) were observed at the Siberian site, for B. nana (30 % larger length increments), Salix pulchra (leaf size and length increments) and Arctagrostis latifolia (leaf size and specific leaf area), but none were observed at the Swedish site. Total biomass production did not increase at either of the study sites. This study corroborates studies in other tundra vegetation types and shows that despite regional differences at the plant level, total tundra plant productivity is, at least at the short or medium term, largely irresponsive to experimentally increased summer precipitation.

AB Palaeoecological reconstructions from the region of southwestern Bulgaria were used for inferring the human impact on the vegetation and landscape during the last 8 millennia. They are based on data from pollen analyses of lakes and peat-bogs, plant macrofossils, archaeobotanical finds and radiocarbon dating. During the early Holocene, after 7900 cal. b.p. (5950 cal. b.c.) the climate changed to cooler summers, milder winters and higher precipitation resulting in the formation of a coniferous belt dominated by Pinus sp. and Abies alba. These favorable environmental pre-conditions had a positive influence on the Neolithisation of the Balkans after the 8200 cal. b.p. (6250 cal. b.c.) cold event, which caused drought in the Eastern Mediterranean. Direct evidence from wood charcoal records from the Neolithic settlement layers in the study area shows a slight modification of the surrounding woodlands and an increase of the light-demanding components, probably expressed through larger forest border zones and thinning out of the wood stands. The increase in the number of settlements in the valleys of southwestern Bulgaria intensified the human activity visible in the palaeobotanical record from 6950 cal. b.p. (5000 cal. b.c.) onwards. Between ca. 5700-5100 cal. b.p. (3800-3200 cal. b.c.) signs of anthropogenic influence on the vegetation are virtually absent. The intensity of human impact increased notably after 3200 cal. b.p. (1400-1250 cal. b.c., approx. Late Bronze Age), documented by a rise of pollen anthropogenic indicators. The final transformations in the natural forest cover after 2750 cal. b.p. (800 cal. b.c. onset of the Iron Age) marked the reduction of the coniferous forests dominated by Abies alba and Pinus sp. and the expansion of Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies. These vegetation changes are contemporaneous with increase of the palaeofire activities and the next peak of anthropogenic indicators. The changes in the landscape during the Roman period and the medieval period reflect regional environmental features and were forced by the diversification of anthropogenic activity.

AB Thicker snowpacks and their insulation effects cause winter-warming and invoke thaw of permafrost ecosystems. Temperature-dependent decomposition of previously frozen carbon (C) is currently considered one of the strongest feedbacks between the Arctic and the climate system, but the direction and magnitude of the net C balance remains uncertain. This is because winter effects are rarely integrated with C fluxes during the snow-free season and because predicting the net C balance from both surface processes and thawing deep layers remains challenging. In this study, we quantified changes in the long-term net C balance (net ecosystem production) in a subarctic peat plateau subjected to 10 years of experimental winter-warming. By combining(210)Pb and(14)Cdating of peat cores with peat growth models, we investigated thawing effects on year-round primary production and C losses through respiration and leaching from both shallow and deep peat layers. Winter-warming and permafrost thaw had no effect on the net C balance, but strongly affected gross C fluxes. Carbon losses through decomposition from the upper peat were reduced as thawing of permafrost induced surface subsidence and subsequent waterlogging. However, primary production was also reduced likely due to a strong decline in bryophytes cover while losses from the old C pool almost tripled, caused by the deepened active layer. Our findings highlight the need to estimate long-term responses of whole-year production and decomposition processes to thawing, both in shallow and deep soil layers, as they may contrast and lead to unexpected net effects on permafrost C storage.

AB Subarctic lakes are getting warmer and more productive due to the joint effects of climate change and intensive land-use practices (e.g. forest clear-cutting and peatland ditching), processes that potentially increase leaching of peat- and soil-stored mercury into lake ecosystems. We sampled biotic communities from primary producers (algae) to top consumers (piscivorous fish), in 19 subarctic lakes situated on a latitudinal (69.0 & ndash;66.5 degrees N), climatic (+3.2 degrees C temperature and +30% precipitation from north to south) and catchment land-use (pristine to intensive forestry areas) gradient. We first tested how the joint effects of climate and productivity influence mercury biomagnification in food webs focusing on the trophic magnification slope (TMS) and mercury baseline (THg baseline) level, both derived from linear regression between total mercury (log10THg) and organism trophic level (TL). We examined a suite of environmental and biotic variables thought to explain THg baseline and TMS with stepwise generalized multiple regression models. Finally, we assessed how climate and lake productivity affect the THg content of top predators in subarctic lakes. We found biomagnification of mercury in all studied lakes, but with variable TMS and THg baseline values. In stepwise multiple regression models, TMS was best explained by negative relationships with food chain length, climate-productivity gradient, catchment properties, and elemental C:N ratio of the top predator (full model R2 = 0.90, p < 0.001). The model examining variation in THg baseline values included the same variables with positive relationships (R2 = 0.69, p = 0.014). Mass standardized THg content of a common top predator (1 kg northern pike, Esox lucius) increased towards warmer and more productive lakes. Results indicate that increasing eutrophication via forestry-related land-use activities increase the THg levels at the base of the food web and in top predators, suggesting that the sources of nutrients and mercury should be considered in future bioaccumulation and biomagnification studies.

AB Peat plateaus and palsas are characteristic morphologies of sporadic permafrost, and the transition from permafrost to permafrost-free ground typically occurs on spatial scales of meters. They are particularly vulnerable to climate change and are currently degrading in Fennoscandia. Here we present a spatially distributed data set of ground surface temperatures for two peat plateau sites in northern Norway for the year 2015-2016. Based on these data and thermal modeling, we investigate how the snow depth and water balance modulate the climate signal in the ground. We find that mean annual ground surface temperatures are centered around 2 to 2.5 degrees C for stable permafrost locations and 3.5 to 4.5 degrees C for permafrost-free locations. The surface freezing degree days are characterized by a noticeable threshold around 200 degrees C.day, with most permafrost-free locations ranging below this value and most stable permafrost ones above it. Freezing degree day values are well correlated to the March snow cover, although some variability is observed and attributed to the ground moisture level. Indeed, a zero curtain effect is observed on temperature time series for saturated soils during winter, while drained peat plateaus show early freezing surface temperatures. Complementarily, modeling experiments allow identifying a drainage effect that can modify 1-m ground temperatures by up to 2 degrees C between drained and water accumulating simulations for the same snow cover. This effect can set favorable or unfavorable conditions for permafrost stability under the same climate forcing.

AB Soil emissions of NO and N2O from typical land uses across Lowland and Highland Scotland were simulated under climate change conditions, during a short-term laboratory study. All locations investigated were significant sources of N2O (range: 157-277 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) and low-to-moderate sources of NO emissions (range: 0.4-30.5 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1)), with a general tendency to decrease with altitude and increase with fertiliser and atmospheric N inputs. Simulated climate warming and extreme events (drought, intensive rainfall) increased soil NO pulses and N2O emissions from both natural and managed ecosystems in the following order: natural Highlands < natural Lowlands < grazed grasslands < natural moorland receiving high NH3 deposition rates. Largest NO emission rates were observed from natural moorlands exposed to high NH3 deposition rates. Although soil NO emissions were much smaller (6-660 times) than those of N2O, their impact on air quality is likely to increase as combustion sources of NO (x) are declining as a result of successful mitigation. This study provides evidence of high N emission rates from natural ecosystems and calls for urgent action to improve existing national and intergovernmental inventories for NO and N2O, which at present do not fully account for emissions from natural soils receiving no direct anthropogenic N inputs.

AB Climate change constitutes a serious threat for European heathlands as unlike other sources of damage, such as over-grazing, local remediation is not a possibility. Within the large pan-European projects, CLIMOOR and VULCAN, the effect of periodic drought and increased temperature were investigated in four heathland ecosystems along a geographical and climatic gradient across Europe. Fluorogenically labelled substrates for four enzymes (glucosidase, sulphatase, phosphatase, leucine amino peptidase) were used to measure extra-cellular enzyme activity in soil samples from each of the CLIMOOR sites. Microbial extra-cellular enzyme production is linked to microbial activity as well as soil physico-chemical properties, making soil enzymes one of the more reactive components of terrestrial ecosystems and potentially excellent indicators of soil microbial functional status and diversity.
   Across all sites and over all the substrates, organic matter content was exponentially, inversely related to enzyme activity. Although the increase in temperature produced by the CLIMOOR roofs was small (on average 0.9 degrees C), this was sufficient to increase enzyme activity in all sites (on average by 45%). The increase was within the range of seasonal variability at each of the sites. The effect of drought on enzyme activity was more pronounced in the Northern European sites than the southern European, and most moisture limited, site. This suggests that the effect of temperature increases may be observed across all regions; however, the soils of northern Europe may be more sensitive to changes in rainfall patterns than more moisture limited Southern European soils.

AB Plant fibers allow for the partial replacement of peat in growing media and have potential to carry and sustain biocontrol organisms. However, they may also carry plant pathogens and they may vary in their degree of biodegradability and their interaction with N, and in this way thus affect the quality of growing media.
   We tested 3 types of plant fibers (flax, miscanthus and reed) for replacement of peat in growing media. In order to (1) kill plant pathogens present on the plant fibers, (2) reduce the N fixation risk of the fibers and (3) provide fibers serving as carrier of biocontrol fungi, various defibration techniques were tested, including extrusion, retruding, disc refining and steam explosion.
   Flax shives obtained from various sources were naturally colonized by viable microsclerotia of the plant pathogen Verticillitum dahliae. When sufficiently high temperatures were reached during defibration, this technique killed the plant pathogen on the shives.
   Untreated flax shives, miscanthus or reed straw were characterized by high N immobilization and thus reduce N availability for plants if used as growing medium. We found a clear positive correlation between the risk for N immobilization versus pH, the hemicellulose content and water-extractable C concentration of the fiber.
   Unlike peat, defibrated pure miscanthus, reed straw and flax shives were easily colonized by fungal biocontrol strains. Inoculation of extruded miscanthus fibers with biocontrol fungi did not increase nor decrease the N immobilization. Reducing the pH of the fibers was effective in reducing the microbial activity and the N fixation.
   Defibrated plant fibers have potential for peat replacement and as carrier for biocontrol fungi. Peat replacement is important in relation to the circular economy, climate change mitigation (prevention of carbon loss and greenhouse gas emissions) and the conservation of fragile ecosystems. Successful application of biocontrol fungi may reduce the need for using chemical crop protection agents in horticulture. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Temperature profoundly impacts on distribution and habitat-use of organisms. The development of ectothermous caterpillars does not depend on host plant quality only, but also on the availability of suitable thermal conditions. Selection for thermally favorable microclimates (i.e. behavioral thermoregulation) is a primary mechanism of temperature control, and caterpillars can be either (or alternately) temperature conformers (i.e. passively adopting ambient temperature conditions) or thermoregulators (i.e. able to some extent to elevate or decrease their body temperature relative to ambient temperature). Here, we addressed the functional significance of different structural vegetation elements for the behavioral thermoregulation by caterpillars of two butterfly species.
   Results: Weather conditions influenced the caterpillar detection probability within host plant patches, indicating that caterpillars can hide and use suitable microclimates provided by vegetation structures to cope with weather variations. This is why we (1) evaluated the heterogeneity in temperature conditions provided by these structures, (2) quantified the influence of ambient temperature and light intensity on caterpillar body temperature, and (3) tested how position on structure, substrate color and exposition influenced caterpillar body temperature. As expected, vegetation structures provided heterogeneous temperature and sun exposition conditions, while caterpillar body temperature was dependent on ambient temperature and light intensity. But body temperature was additionally influenced by the position on vegetation structures, substrate color and exposition.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that there is no unique and fixed structure in the vegetation subsuming the best thermal conditions for caterpillars. We argue that a better understanding of the thermal properties of vegetation structures is essential for correctly understanding caterpillar habitat-use and the behavioral mechanisms driving their body thermoregulation. Conceptually this means that thermal conditions should be included in the definition of a species' functional habitat. Practically this may influence the choice of appropriate habitat management for species of conservation concern. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) technique is a widely used method to quantify the net exchange of CO2 between ecosystems and the atmosphere. The quality control and data analysis of calculated fluxes are essential to ensure accurate budget estimates. Ecosystem scale CO2 exchange between a typical permafrost peatland of the Great Hing'an Mountains and the atmosphere was measured during the growing season of 2014 and 2015 using the open-path eddy covariance technique. Footprint analysis and turbulence stationary test were applied to the calculated fluxes to improve the data accuracy. High quality data were then screened to study emission patterns. Combining widely used models with the observed data, an empirical model derived by photosynthetically active radiation was developed to fit daily photosynthesis reduction. Seasonal variation of apparent quantum yield (alpha, mol CO2 mol(-1) photon), maximum photosynthesis rate (P-max, mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) and temperature sensitivity for respiration (E-0, K) were found to follow a unimodal distribution and could be simulated by a Gaussian based equation. The use of EC data and the potential issues, especially the bias on respiration estimation, were discussed. Detailed utilization and analyses of the EC data are helpful in revealing the CO2 exchange patterns on different time scales, and also contribute to reducing the result differences between EC and other measurement techniques.

AB OzFlux is the regional Australian and New Zealand flux tower network that aims to provide a continental-scale national research facility to monitor and assess trends, and improve predictions, of Australia's terrestrial biosphere and climate. This paper describes the evolution, design, and current status of OzFlux as well as provides an overview of data processing. We analyse measurements from all sites within the Australian portion of the OzFlux network and two sites from New Zealand. The response of the Australian biomes to climate was largely consistent with global studies except that Australian systems had a lower ecosystem water-use efficiency. Australian semi-arid/arid ecosystems are important because of their huge extent (70 %) and they have evolved with common moisture limitations. We also found that Australian ecosystems had a similar radiation-use efficiency per unit leaf area compared to global values that indicates a convergence toward a similar biochemical efficiency. The two New Zealand sites represented extremes in productivity for a moist temperate climate zone, with the grazed dairy farm site having the highest GPP of any OzFlux site (2620 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) and the natural raised peat bog site having a very low GPP (820 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). The paper discusses the utility of the flux data and the synergies between flux, remote sensing, and modelling. Lastly, the paper looks ahead at the future direction of the network and concludes that there has been a substantial contribution by OzFlux, and considerable opportunities remain to further advance our understanding of ecosystem response to disturbances, including drought, fire, land-use and land-cover change, land management, and climate change, which are relevant both nationally and internationally. It is suggested that a synergistic approach is required to address all of the spatial, ecological, human, and cultural challenges of managing the delicately balanced ecosystems in Australasia.

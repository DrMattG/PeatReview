AB Accumulation of organic matter (OM) was studied in four ombrotrophic peat bogs in Finland: Haijavalta. (vicinity of a Cu-Ni smelter), Outok-umpu (near a closed Cu-Ni mine), Alkkia (Ni-treated site) and Hietajarvi (a pristine site). At each sampling site, two peat cores (15 x 15 x 100 cm) were taken. Age-dating of peat was determined using Pb-210\ method (CRS model). The local annual temperature sum and precipitation for the past 125 years were modeled. The objective was to compare recent net accumulation rates of heavy metal polluted ombrotrophic peat bogs with those of a pristine bog, and to study the relationship between weather and net accumulation rates. Based on Pb-210 age-dating, the upper 16-cm peat layer at Harjavalta, 35 cm at Outokumpu and 25 cm at Hietajarvi represents 125 years of peat formation, yielding the following average peat accumulation rates: Harjavalta 1.3 mm year(-1), Outokumpu 2.8 mm year(-1) and Hietajarvi 2.0 mm year(-1). At the Alkkia site, the Ni treatment in 1962 had completely stopped the peat accumulation. Net accumulation rates were related to precipitation at Outokumpu, Harjavalta and Hietajarvi sites. In addition, emissions released from the nearby located Cu-Ni smelter could have affected negatively net OM accumulation rate at Harjavalta site. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mosses are keystone species in peatlands and are an important part of the vegetation of the pre-mined peatlands. Therefore, mosses should be included in rehabilitation projects following oil sands exploitation in north-western Canada. However, mosses growing in post-mined landscapes must tolerate elevated salinity levels found in oil sands process water (OSPW). Knowledge of salinity tolerance and thresholds for fen mosses is needed to place these mosses in the newly created landscapes. We tested the effects of NaCl and Na2SO4 on four fen moss species growing in Petri dishes in growth chambers. We simulated two scenarios: (1) four immersion times (1/4, 1, 3 and 7 days) in NaCl (0%, 20%, 60% or 100% of the concentration found in OSPW) mimicking periodic flooding and (2) a permanent saline influence (NaCl or Na2SO4 alone or in combination at 0%, 30%, 50% or 70% of the concentrations found in OSPW) mimicking situations of high water tables with different contamination levels. The effects on moss growth were estimated by counting new innovations of Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Campylium stellatum, Sphagnum warnstorfii and Tomenthypnum nitens. All tested mosses tolerated saline levels typically found in post-mined landscapes (up to 500 mg L-1 of NaCl and 400 mg L-1 of Na2SO4) for up to 100 days of exposure. Short periods of immersion (up to 7 days independently of salt concentrations) induced the production of innovation in non-Sphagnum species, but S. warnstorfii was more rapidly impacted at higher salt concentrations. Short pulses of salt (from 6 h to 7 days) did not influence the formation of new innovations for C. stellatum and T. nitens. Salt type (NaCl and/or Na2SO4) had no effect on moss growth. However, a longer exposure (100 days) with saline water, even at low concentrations, diminished the formation of new innovations for B. pseudotriquetrum and T. nitens. C. stellatum was the least affected by salinity and thus we suggest it is the best species to reintroduce in constructed fens. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   of Sphagnum mosses
ID FUSCUM
AB Sphagnum mosses dominate the plant cover of boreal bogs and accumulate carbon as peat. However, discoloured necrotic Sphagnum patches are also common in bogs. Necrotic Sphagnum inhibits peat accumulation, and consequently these areas may sink with respect to their surroundings with healthy mosses and continuing peat accumulation. Therefore, necrotic patches in the moss carpet could have an important role in triggering the succession of Sphagnum communities and the differentiation of bog microtopography. Our main aim was to find out how necrotic Sphagnum patches are distributed on a microtopographic gradient and among Sphagnum species. Based on these results we discuss the development and likely role of necrotic patches. It was found that necrotic patches occur on all types of bog microfonns and contain the most of common Sphagnum species. Necrotic patches were more common and larger in wet hollows. The development of necrotic patches depends on their location on the microtopographic gradient. Necrotic patches on higher microforms usually re-vegetate, whereas those in hollows can result in mud-bottom hollows.

AB Peatland decomposition may be altered by hydrology and plant functional groups (PFGs), but exactly how the latter influences decomposition is unclear, as are potential interactions of these factors. We used a factorial mesocosm experiment with intact 1 m(3) peat monoliths to explore how PFGs (sedges vs Ericaceae) and water table level individually and interactively affect decomposition processes. Decomposition was measured using litter bags at three depths filled with cellulose strips to mimic decomposition of a simple plant-derived structure, and Sphagnum tissue to simulate decomposition of the most abundant recalcitrant material in peatlands. We also analyzed the potential activity of five hydrolytic extracellular enzymes at an intermediate depth. We found lowered water table reduced activity of several enzymes and increased cellulose and Sphagnum decomposition. Presence of Ericaceae reduced decomposition of the recalcitrant Sphagnum tissue, whereas higher activity of chitinase was found in the combined presence of sedges and Ericaceae. We found no relationship between any potential enzyme activity and Sphagnum decomposition rate. Overall our results showed a dominating role of water table controlling decomposition processes, as well as support for the hypothesis that the presence of mycorrhizal Ericaceae can slow decomposition processes of complex plant tissues in peatlands.

AB Understanding the influence of salt on the release and transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is crucial for developing management strategies for coastal wetlands. We hypothesize that salt causes distinct changes in certain compound classes of DOM, distinguishable from the impact of other factors such as peat origin and decomposition degree. Therefore, the DOM composition was investigated in freshwater and saltwater extracts of nine peat samples of varying origin and decomposition degree. Samples were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen concentrations and pH values, and organic matter composition by temperature-resolved pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS). The data revealed larger abundances of phenols/lignin monomers, peptides, carbohydrates, (mainly heterocyclic) N-compounds/nitriles and alkylaromatics in the saltwater extracts. The thermal release curves in Py-FIMS indicated a precipitation of fractions of alkylaromatics, N-compounds/nitriles and phenols/lignin monomers and a release of lipids, alkylaromatics and free fatty acids n-C-16 to n-C-34 in the saltwater extracts. Coagulation/precipitation, cation exchange and, for free fatty acids, the formation of micelles seem to be key mechanisms of the salt impact. Due to the stronger direct and indirect influences of saltwater on less decomposed peat an adapted management should be directed to preferentially protect rather pristine peatlands from saltwater intrusions that can be expected as a result of rising ocean levels under climate change.

AB Peatlands are common components of the Northeast Asian landscapes, while the vegetation and hydrological variations of these peatlands remain unclear. To address this issue, here we use plant macrofossil and grain size analyses to reconstruct the regional vegetation and hydrology dynamics of the Hani peatland over the past similar to 7766 years. From 7766 cal. yr BP to 6000 cal. yr BP, the Hani peatland was characterized by wet conditions and high water levels. The vegetation community was mainly composed of hygrophilic plants during this period. These features were probably controlled by the high total solar irradiation (TSI) and less El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activities. From 6000 cal. yr BP to 2000 cal. yr BP, the Hani peatland was characterized by moderate moisture conditions and decreasing water levels, with the vegetation community dominated by both hygrophilic and xerophilic plants. These features were probably influenced by the decreased TSI and increased ENSO activities. From 2000 cal. yr BP to the present, the Hani peatland was characterized by dry conditions and low water levels composed mainly of xerophilic plants. These features were linked to low TSI and more ENSO activities. These correlations reveal that the millennial scale changes of the peatlands in Northeast Asia were primarily driven by the collective impacts of solar irradiation and ENSO activity, thus expanding our understanding of long term interactions between vegetation, hydrology, and climate of Northeast Asian peatlands.

AB The Canadian horticultural peat industry generates carbon emissions through various methods of peat extraction, processing, and land-use changes. This study provides a carbon emissions analysis comparing the traditional vacuum harvest (VH) and block-cut (BC) extraction techniques to a new acrotelm transplant (AT) method that restores natural peatland function by preserving and replacing the surface layer vegetation as part of the extraction process. The relative global warming potential for each extraction method was determined by estimating carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane exchange for each phase of peat extraction, including emissions from land-use change and machinery fuel consumption. Preliminary findings, based on 1 y of measurements, indicate that the AT technique has the lowest annual carbon emissions compared to the VH and BC methods. Projected total carbon emissions from a 75-ha peatland after 50 y of extraction using the AT technique produced a sink of approximately 3300 t CO(2) equivalents (CO(2)-e). This represents a marked reduction in total carbon emissions estimated for the VH (19 000 t CO(2)-e) and BC (29 000 t CO(2)-e) extraction techniques. This analysis suggests that the AT method reestablishes peat accumulation and peatland carbon storage function more effectively than the VH and BC methods, which are associated with delayed restoration efforts. Consequently, the AT technique has the potential to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the Canadian horticultural peat industry.

TI FACIES DEVELOPMENT IN THE LOWER FREEPORT COAL BED, WEST-CENTRAL
   PENNSYLVANIA, USA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID APPALACHIAN BASIN USA; SWAMP VEGETATION; ILLINOIS
AB The Lower Freeport coal bed in west-central Pennsylvania is interpreted to have formed within a lacustrine-mire environment. Conditions of peat formation, caused by the changing chemical and physical environments, produced five coal facies and two mineral-rich parting facies within the coal bed. The coal bed facies are compositionally unique, having developed under varying conditions, and are manifested by megascopic, petrographic, palynologic and quality characteristics.
   The initial environment of the Lower Freeport peat resulted in a coal facies that is relatively high in ash yield and contains large amounts of lycopod miospores and moderate abundances of crypto-telinite, crypto-gelocollinite, inertinite and tree fem miospores. This initial Lower Freeport peat is interpreted to have been a topogenous body that was low lying, relatively nutrient rich (mesotrophic to eutrophic), and susceptible to ground water and to sediment influx from surface water. The next facies to form was a ubiquitous, clay-rich durain parting which is attributed to a general rise in the water table accompanied by widespread flooding. Following formation of the parting, peat accumulation resumed within an environment that inhibited clastic input. Development of doming in this facies restricted deposition of the upper shale parting to the margins of the mire and allowed low-ash peat to form in the interior of the mire. Because this environment was conducive to preservation of cellular tissue, this coal facies also contains large amounts of crypto-telinite. This facies development is interpreted to have been a transitional phase from topogenous, planar peat formation to slightly domed, oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) peat formation. As domed peat formation continued, fluctuations in the water table enabled oxidation of the peat surface and produced high inertinite concentrations toward the top of the coal bed. Tree ferns became an increasingly important peat contributor in these upper facies, based on the palynoflora. This floral change is interpreted to have resulted from the peat surface becoming less wet or better drained, a condition that inhibited proliferation of lycopod trees. Accumulation of the peat continued until rising water levels formed a freshwater lake within which clays and silts were deposited.
   The development of the Lower Freeport peat from a planar mire through transitional phases toward domed peat formation may be an example of the type of peat formation of other upper Middle and Upper Pennsylvanian coal beds.

AB The extensive blanket peatlands of the UK uplands account for almost half of total national terrestrial carbon storage. However, much of the blanket peat is severely eroded so that the contemporary role of the peatland system in carbon sequestration is compromised by losses of organic carbon in dissolved (DOC) and particulate (POC) form in the fluvial system. This paper presents the first detailed assessment of dissolved and organic carbon losses from a severely eroded headwater peatland (River Ashop, South Pennines, UK). Total annual fluvial organic carbon losses range from 29106?Mg?C km,-2 decreasing from the headwaters to the main catchment outlet. In contrast to less eroded systems fluvial organic carbon flux is dominated by POC center dot POC:DOC ratios decrease from values of 4 in the headwaters to close to unity at the catchment outlet. These results demonstrate the importance of eroding headwater sites as sources of POC to the fluvial system. Comparison with a range of catchment characteristics reveals that drainage density is the best predictor of POC:DOC but there is scatter in the relation in the headwaters. Steep declines in specific POC yield from headwater catchments are consistent with storage of POC within the fluvial system. Key to the significance of fluvial carbon flux in greenhouse gas budgets is understanding the fate of fluvial carbon. Further work on the fate of POC and the role of floodplains in fluvial carbon cycling is urgently required. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Warming and water table drawdown greatly reshape peatland carbon cycle, especially when considering the old carbon stored under the peatland subsurface. However, little is known about the effects of warming, oxidizing by drying or their combination on carbon decomposition at different depths (0-100 cm) of peat. In this research, soil of different depths from Zoige Plateau was incubated in four scenarios (8 degrees C-anaerobic, 8 degrees C-aerobic, 18 degrees C-anaerobic and 18 degrees C-aerobic) to detect the exported carbon. Our result showed that soil respiration (Rs) increased obviously with enhanced temperature and oxygen. The total CO2 fluxes of 2400.22 +/- 57.69 mg m(-2) d(-1) under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition increased by 73.6%, 40.7% and 176.5% with warming, oxidizing and their combined effect, respectively. The average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was 74.90 +/- 8.09 mg kg(-1) under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition, but increased by 53.5%, 44% and 159.4%, respectively under the condition of warming, oxidizing and their combination. Rs and its variation underwarming and oxidization differed significantly among different depths, probably caused by the differences of soil substrate, especially the variation in distribution of soil microbes and enzymes among depths of peatlands. By classifying the source of Rs as young soil (YS: 0-20 cm) and old soil (OS: 21-100 cm), this reseaerch found that OS accounted for a huge part of total Rs under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition (CO2: 74.2%; DOC: 60.7%). Such relative contribution of OS to total Rs did not change obviously with warming or oxidizing. Though YS and OS responded equally to warming and oxidizing, OS was responsible for a larger proportion of total increase in Rs. Compared with other studies, we concluded that peatlands soil in our field of mid-latitude and high altitude is less sensitive to warming and oxidizing than peatlands of higher latitude, but that OS of this peatlands is more critical in predicting regional carbon cycle.

AB The study of environmental change during the 'Little Ice Age' ('LIA') offers a great potential to improve our current understanding of the climate system and human-environment interactions. Here, a high-resolution multiproxy investigation of a Mediterranean mire from central-western Spain, covering the last similar to 700 years, was used to reconstruct peat dynamics and land-use change and to gain further insights into their relationship with 'LIA' climate (temperature and moisture). To accomplish this, concentrations and accumulation rates of major and minor lithogenic (Si, K, Ti, Rb and Zr) and biophilic (C and N) elements, as well as humification indices (UV-absorbance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)) and pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs, were determined. Peatland dynamics seems to have been coupled to changes in solar irradiance and hydrological conditions. Our results point to wetter conditions after the mid-16th century, although with high intra-annual fluctuations. At the late 18th century, when solar activity was systematically higher than before, peat carbon accumulation rates (PCAR) showed a continuous increase and the humification indices suggest a change towards more humified peat. Enhanced soil erosion occurred at similar to AD 1660-1800 (SE1), similar to AD 1830-1920 (SE2) and similar to AD 1940-1970 (SE3), although a minor increase in Si fluxes was also detected by similar to AD 1460-1580. All phases coincided with higher abundances of fire indicators, but the changes recorded during the similar to AD 1460-1580 event and SE1 coincide with the Sporer and Maunder minima, so a climatic influence on soil erosion cannot be discounted. Changes in the sources of mineral matter to the catchment between similar to AD 1550 and similar to AD 1650 and since the mid-17th century were likely related to modifications of tree cover and/or variations in wind strength.

AB Leaves of bilberry (V myrtillus), bog bilberry (V uliginosum) and downy birch (B. pubescens) were collected five times during a growing season from 18 plots in a drainage area, and needles of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) once during the following winter from the same plots at Parkano, southern Finland. The aim was to study the potassium nutrition of the test plants and relationships between the foliar potassium concentrations of Scots pine and of the test plants. The estimation of the potassium nutrition of test plants was based on the accumulation of putrescine in foliage. Apart from single observations, elevated putrescine concentrations were found when the potassium concentrations were <5 mg g(-1) in bilberry, <4 mg g(-1) in bog bilberry and <6 mg g(-1) in downy birch, and the highest concentrations below the potassium levels of 3.0-3.5 mg g(-1). At the concentrations of 2-3 mg g(-1) the accumulation increased pronouncedly in bog bilberry but less in downy birch and only slightly in bilberry. The foliar potassium concentrations in test plants correlated closely with the concentrations in pine needles. The concentrations of all species in August were quite stable at the levels of the severe and slight potassium deficiency of pine (3.5 and 4.5 mg g(-1) respectively) indicating that August would be suitable for collecting foliage. The concentrations in bog bilberry were very close to the concentrations in pine at the severe and those in bilberry at the slight deficiency level of pine. All test plants could be used for predicting the potassium nutrition of Scots pine, but additional research is needed for the practical application of the method.

AB Peat bogs generally exhibit significantly lower Hg accumulation rates during the pre-industrial (pre-1800 AD) period than lake sediments. Organic matter (OM) humification and losses of associated Hg from the deeper sections of peat profiles were recently proposed as an explanation for this widely-observed discrepancy. Here, this hypothesis is tested by examining the state of OM preservation and Hg accumulation rates in a dated, 165 cm (6270 yr) long permafrost peat core from northern Canada. Pyrolytic speciation of organic carbon using RockEval 6 analysis, and organic petrology of the OM, showed that OM throughout most of the core was better preserved than is typical of many peat deposits, although below similar to 120 cm depth the initial stages of humification resulted in losses of labile organic compounds and increases in the proportion of refractory carbon. However, through most of the core there was little evidence of significant humification which could have caused large OM mass losses. Mercury flux averaged 0.82 +/- 0.36 mu g/m(2)/yr over the six millennia of peat accumulation, well within the range previously reported from other peat bogs. Thus, this paper adds to other studies, using a variety of humification indicators, which found no relationship between OM preservation/humification and pre-industrial Hg flux rates in peat bogs. Other explanations must be sought to account for the observed differences between pre-industrial peat and lake sediment Hg histories. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Plant species and growth forms differ widely in litter chemistry, which affects decay and may have important consequences for plant growth via e.g. the release of nutrients and growth-inhibitory compounds. We investigated the overall short-term (9.5 months) and medium-term (21.5 months) feedback effects of leaf litter quality and quantity on plant production, and tested whether growth forms can be used to generalise differences among litter species. Leaf litter effects of 21 sub-arctic vascular peatland species on Poa alpina test plants changed clearly with time. Across all growth forms, litter initially reduced plant biomass compared with untreated plants, particularly litters with a high decomposition rate or low initial lignin/P ratio. In the second year, however, litter effects were neutral or positive, and related to initial litter N concentration (positive), C/N, polyphenol/N and polyphenol/P ratios (all negative), but not to decomposability. Differences in effect size among several litter species were large, while differences in response to increasing litter quantities were not significant or of similar magnitude to differences in response to three contrasting litter species. Growth forms did not differ in initial litter effects, but second-year plant production showed a trend (P < 0.10) for differences in response to litters of different growth forms: evergreen shrubs < graminoids or deciduous shrubs < forbs. While long-persisting negative litter effects were predominant across all growth forms, our data indicate that even within nutrient-constrained ecosystems such as northern peatlands, vascular plant species, and possibly growth forms, differ in litter feedbacks to plant growth. Differences in the composition of undisturbed plant communities or species shifts induced by external disturbance, such as climate change, may therefore feedback strongly to plant biomass production and probably nutrient cycling rates in northern peatlands.

AB In the low Venetian plain (northeastern Italy) thick sequences of silt and sand layers alternate with common, thin layers of peat and organic silt; the organic layers in the topmost 30 in of the Late Pleistocene alluvial series span between 23,000 and 14,000 yr BP (radiocarbon dating), in an area measuring 100 km by 30 km. They indicate broad areas where wetlands developed. We aim to understand the features and the origin of the wetlands by undertaking sedimentological, pollen, non-pollen palynomorph and plant macrofossil analyses. Thirteen cores were drilled in the central zone of the low Venetian plain near the coast of the Adriatic Sea and 79 samples were analysed. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction based on previous pollen analysis did not emphasize the areas where peat layers were formed, suggesting a homogenous steppe environment, typical of a cold and dry climate. They were probably waterlogged for most of the year allowing the formation of peat and the development of local plant communities of mainly aquatic species. Macrofossil and pollen analyses suggest that herbaceous plants, such as Cyperaceae and Poaceae (probably Carex fusca and Phragmites australis), and brown mosses (mainly Scorpidium scorpioides) were the most important components of wetland communities. Fossils of obligate aquatic organisms indicate open water environments, these include macrofossils of Nymphaea, Characeae, Bryozoa and Potamogeton, and non-pollen palynomorphs such as algal resting cells, free cells and colonies (Zygnemataceae, Spirogyra, Mougeotia, Closterium idiosporum, Type 225, Type 229, Botryococcus, Pediastrum cf. boryanum, P. cf simplex, Ceratium hirundinella, Tetraedron cf minimum and Type 333), oocytes of aquatic invertebrates (Type 353A and 353B) and incompletely known types probably of algal origin (Type 303, Type 74, Type 128A and 128B). A discontinuous occurrence of fungal spores and other microfossils (Type 200, Gaeumannomyces (Type 126), Glomus (Type 207), Type 3 5 1, Type 79, and incompletely known types) suggests frequent fluctuations of the water depth with periodic emersions of the bottom of the ponds or fens. The water quality preferred by the identified species, or suggested in literature for the fossil types, is mainly eutrophic to mesotrophic and rich in cations.
   Peatland formed in wide, low-lying areas between the fluvial ridges which were periodically inundated by the fluctuating groundwater. Peat accumulated in continuous layers only where the fen organic deposition prevailed the alluvial minerogenic sediment. When alluvial deposition buried the organic deposit, the peat level was incorporated into the stratigraphic record. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Differential response of carbon cycling to long-term nutrient input and

AB Peatlands play an important role in global carbon cycling, but their responses to long-term anthropogenically changed hydrologic conditions and nutrient infiltration are not well known. While experimental manipulation studies, e.g., fertilization or water table manipulations, exist on the plot scale, only few studies have addressed such factors under in situ conditions. Therefore, an ecological gradient from the center to the periphery of a continental Canadian peatland bordering a eutrophic water reservoir, as reflected by increasing nutrient input, enhanced water level fluctuations, and increasing coverage of vascular plants, was used for a case study of carbon cycling along a sequence of four differently altered sites. We monitored carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) surface fluxes and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 concentrations in peat profiles from April 2014 through September 2015. Moreover, we studied bulk peat and pore-water quality and we applied delta C-13-CH4 and delta C-13-CO2 stable isotope abundance analyses to examine dominant CH4 production and emission pathways during the growing season of 2015. We observed differential responses of carbon cycling at the four sites, presumably driven by abundances of plant functional types and vicinity to the reservoir. A shrub-dominated site in close vicinity to the reservoir was a comparably weak sink for CO2 (in 1.5 years: -1093 +/- 794, in 1 year: +135 +/- 281 g CO2 m(-2); a net release) as compared to two graminoid-moss-dominated sites and a moss-dominated site (in 1.5 years: -1552 to -2260 g CO2 m(-2), in 1 year: -896 to -1282 g CO2 m(-2)). Also, the shrub-dominated site featured notably low DIC pore-water concentrations and comparably C-13-enriched CH4 (delta C-13-CH4: -57.81 +/- 7.03 parts per thousand) and depleted CO2 (delta C-13-CO2: -15.85 +/- 3.61 parts per thousand) in a more decomposed peat, suggesting a higher share of CH4 oxidation and differences in predominant methanogenic pathways. In comparison to all other sites, the graminoid-moss-dominated site in closer vicinity to the reservoir featured a similar to 30% higher CH4 emission (in 1.5 years: +61.4 +/- 32, in 1 year: +39.86 +/- 16.81 g CH4 m(-2)). Low delta C-13-CH4 signatures (-62.30 +/- 5.54 parts per thousand) indicated only low mitigation of CH4 emissions by methanotrophic activity here. Pathways of methanogenesis and methanotrophy appeared to be related to the vicinity to the water reservoir: the importance of acetoclastic CH4 production apparently increased toward the reservoir, whereas the importance of CH4 oxidation increased toward the peatland center. Plant-mediated transport was the prevailing CH4 emission pathway at all sites even where graminoids were rare. Our study thus illustrates accelerated carbon cycling in a strongly altered peatland with consequences for CO2 and CH4 budgets. However, our results suggest that long-term excess nutrient input does not necessarily lead to a loss of the peatland carbon sink function.

AB In 2013, a pilot experimental field of about 15 ha was set up within the basin of Lake Massaciuccoli (Tuscany, Italy) in order to compare different management strategies-a paludicultural system (PCS), a constructed wetland system (CWS), a nearly-natural wetland system (NWS)-for peatland restoration after almost a century of drainage-based agricultural use (CS). After five years, changes in peat soil quality were investigated from a chemical, biochemical, and ecoenzymatic perspective. The soil in CS was mainly characterized by oxidant conditions, higher content of overall microbial activity, low levels of easily available phosphorus for vegetation, and medium total carbon content ranging from 25.0% to 30.7%. In PCS, the levels of total carbon and the content of bioavailable P were higher, while the oxidant conditions were lower compared to the other systems. As expected, the soils in CWS and NWS were characterized by the most reduced conditions and by the highest levels of arylsulphatase activity. It was noteworthy that soils in the NWS systems were characterized by the highest level of nonavailable P. Outputs from ecoenzymatic activity confirmed the physico-chemical and biochemical results.

AB We have analyzed decade-long methane flux data set from a boreal fen, Siikaneva, together with data on environmental parameters and carbon dioxide exchange. The methane flux showed seasonal cycle but no systematic diel cycle. The highest fluxes were observed in July-August with average value of 73 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Wintertime fluxes were small but positive, with January-March average of 6.7 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Daily average methane emission correlated best with peat temperatures at 20-35 cm depths. The second highest correlation was with gross primary production (GPP). The best correspondence between emission algorithm and measured fluxes was found for a variable-slope generalized linear model (r(2) = 0.89) with peat temperature at 35 cm depth and GPP as explanatory variables, slopes varying between years. The homogeneity of slope approach indicated that seasonal variation explained 79% of the sum of squares variation of daily average methane emission, the interannual variation in explanatory factors 7.0%, functional change 5.3%, and random variation 9.1%. Significant correlation between interannual variability of growing season methane emission and that of GPP indicates that on interannual time scales GPP controls methane emission variability, crucially for development of process-based methane emission models. Annual methane emission ranged from 6.0 to 14 gC m(-2) and was 2.7 +/- 0.4% of annual GPP. Over 10-year period methane emission was 18% of net ecosystem exchange as carbon. The weak relation of methane emission to water table position indicates that space-to-time analogy, used to extrapolate spatial chamber data in time, may not be applicable in seasonal time scales.

AB In headwater peatlands, saturation-excess overland flow is a dominant source of river discharge. Human modifications to headwater peatlands result in vegetation cover change but there is a lack of understanding about how the spatial distribution of such change impacts flood peaks. A fully distributed version of TOPMODEL with an overland flow velocity module was used to simulate flood response for three upland peat basins. Bare peat strips adjacent to channels resulted in a higher and faster flow peak; for a 20 mm h(-1) rainfall event, with bare riparian zones covering 10% of the basin area, peaks were increased, compared to the current hydrograph, by 12.8%, 1.8%, and 19.6% in the three basins. High density Sphagnum ground cover over the same riparian zones reduced flow peaks (e.g., by 10.1%, 1.8%, and 13.4% for the 20 mm h(-1) event) compared to the current hydrograph. With similar total areas of land-cover change, the size of randomly located patches of changed cover had no effect on peak flow for patch sizes up to 40,000 m(2). However, cover changes on gentle slope areas generally resulted in a larger change in peak flow when compared with the same changes on steeper slopes. Considering all results for the same proportion of catchment area that undergoes change, land-cover change along narrow riparian buffer strips had the highest impact on river flow. Thus, the protection and revegetation of damaged riparian areas in upland peat catchments may be highly beneficial for flood management.

AB We computed daily discharge (Q) versus gross drainage area (GDA) regression analyses for the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons for six small to medium headwater catchments at a northern peatland complex in the James/Hudson Bay lowlands. Temporal dynamics of the daily goodness of fits (R2) between Q and GDA were then examined to identify the most relevant conceptual model of runoff generation in this landscape. We observed high R2 values during low flow conditions (mean R2?=?0.93 for 2009 and 2010). During wetter periods and in particular during large runoff events, the relationship degraded rapidly and consistently, suggesting differences in quickflow response among the gauged catchments. At low flows, the six catchments generated equivalent amounts of runoff (mm), leading to a strong QGDA relationship. During high flows, total growing season runoff increased systematically with GDA between 8 and 50?km2 and then decreased with further increases in GDA. These differences were responsible for the observed breakdown in the daily QGDA relationships and also resulted in significant differences in total runoff among the six catchments during the wetter year. Quantitative landscape analysis using a 5-m resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model revealed that near-stream zone characteristics vary systematically with scale in a manner that is consistent with the observed patterns of quickflow runoff response. In this northern peatland complex, fast-responding flowpaths in the spatially discrete near-stream zones may be the key determinant of catchment runoff efficiency at the small to medium (similar to 10 to similar to 200?km2) headwater catchment scales analysed here. Moreover, the relatively organized drainage patterns observed in this study are consistent with our understanding of ecohydrological feedbacks driving geomorphic evolution of northern peatlands.

AB The chemistry of Wet Spodosols (Aquods) differs from well-drained Spodosols. Two different hypotheses have been suggested to explain the contrasting genesis of wet spodic horizons. This study attempted to determine whether Aquods at a Danish peat-bog wetland site are a result of (i) in situ illuviation under a fluctuating water table, or (ii) degradation of a former Fe-rich, well-drained spodic horizon. Methods included soil surveys, wet chemical analyses, micromorphology, pollen analysis, and radiocarbon dating of soil organic matter (OM) fractions. Aquods, and soil material with spodic features, were exclusively found in sandy material at the margins of or underneath sphagnum peat bogs, whereas Inceptisols were found on well-drained sandy deposits only. Aluminum content was very high and Fe low in spodic materials with ortstein properties. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of wet sandy 2Bs horizons were dominated by alkyl C (70%) from water-insoluble OM and were clearly distinct from NMR spectra of overlying 2Bhsm material. Pollen analysis revealed that an open forest with a thick mor layer dominated until shortly after 5000 yr BP, when sphagnum was first recorded. Radiocarbon ages of bulk soil C in the spodic horizons had mean residence times of 4500 to 4400 yr. Accordingly, the spodic B horizon was probably formed by strong in situ illuviation of Al-OM complexes before the sphagnum peat bog formation. This suggests that spodic material formation and thus strong C accumulation underneath this Danish peat bog took place for a limited period, only in susceptible parent material, and at the margins of the expanding peat bog.

AB Oceanic island flora is vulnerable to future climate warming, which is likely to promote changes in vegetation composition, and invasion of non-native species. Sub-Antarctic islands are predicted to experience rapid warming during the next century; therefore, establishing trajectories of change in vegetation communities is essential for developing conservation strategies to preserve biological diversity. We present a Late-glacial-early Holocene (16 500-6450 cal a bp) palaeoecological record from Hooker's Point, Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), South Atlantic. This period spans the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, providing insight into biological responses to abrupt climate change. Pollen and plant macrofossil records appear insensitive to climatic cooling during the Late-glacial, but undergo rapid turnover in response to regional warming. The absence of trees throughout the Late-glacial-early Holocene enables the recognition of far-travelled pollen from southern South America. The first occurrence of Nothofagus (southern beech) may reflect changes in the strength and/or position of the Southern Westerly Wind Belt during the Late-glacial period. Peat inception and accumulation at Hooker's Point is likely to be promoted by the recalcitrant litter of wind-adapted flora. This recalcitrant litter helps to explain widespread peatland development in a comparatively dry environment, and suggests that wind-adapted peatlands can remain carbon sinks even under low precipitation regimes.

ID BOGONG HIGH-PLAINS; VEGETATION RECOVERY; NEW-ZEALAND
AB The floristic composition and structure of peatland vegetation in adjoining subalpine catchments of the Bogong High Plains ( north-eastern Victoria) were monitored between 1979 and 2006. Grazing by cattle had been excluded from one catchment since 1946, when it was fenced. Peatland vegetation in both catchments was partially burnt in a wild. re in 2003. Between 1979 and 1999, in the ungrazed peatland, the cover of Sphagnum cristatum Hampe and Baeckea gunniana Schauer increased and the cover of pools decreased, whereas in the grazed peatland the cover of B. gunniana and Epacris paludosa R. Br. decreased and the cover of Empodisma minus ( Hook. f.) L. A. S. Johnson & D. F. Cutler increased. The cover of all recorded species decreased following a. re in 2003. Between 2004 and 2006, a significant increase in cover was detected in two of eight species measured in burnt areas. In burnt areas, the number of native species per quadrat increased in the grazed peatland and the numbers of exotic species per quadrat increased in both peatlands over that period. By 2006, the peatlands had largely recovered floristically from the 2003. res but it is likely to be decades before the cover of S. cristatum and Richea continentis B. L. Burtt. reaches pre-fire levels. Control of several exotic species that established after the. re ( especially Salix cinerea L. and Juncus spp.) may be required.

AB Root exudates released by vascular plants contain significant amounts of photosynthetically-derived low molecular weight carbon compounds and gases, such as oxygen. These compounds are reported to have a priming effect on the activity of soil microbes which, in turn, release extracellular soil enzymes. Rates of root exudation are known to correlate positively with photosynthesis rates. As such, we hypothesized that phenol oxidase activity in the rhizosphere of peatland plants could be manipulated by varying the intensity of light to which above ground biomass is exposed, in line with recent solar radiation management proposals of geoengineers. Since phenol oxidase plays a pivotal role in regulating biodegradation in peat soils, through a mechanism widely known as the 'enzymic latch', this approach was thought to have potential as an ecoengineering strategy designed to enhance carbon sequestration in these environments. Our experiment however, found little relationship between phenol oxidase activity and light intensity level for any of the plants analysed, although significant differences in enzyme activity were observed between plant species. It is argued therefore, that encouraging the growth of particular plant species may be more effective at enhancing carbon sequestration in peatlands than manipulating ambient light levels.

AB Nitrogen (N) deposition may affect litter decomposition and may thus have an impact on the rate of carbon (C) sequestration in Sphagnum peatlands. We present results from four separate experiments aimed at delineating the effects of litter N-enrichment, Sphagnum species, stem part of Sphagnum, and place of incubation on decomposition rate and N release. We measured mass loss and N loss from litterbags incubated at 10-15 cm in the field for one year.
   Mass loss was positively related to the N/C quotient of the litter, but depended strongly on the range in N/C quotients observed; only a distinct difference in N/C quotients affected mass loss. Although hummock species decayed at a slower rate than hollow species, the differences between the species became less pronounced for old stem parts and for N-enriched litter. Old stem parts decayed at a slower rate than young stem parts, except for S. papillosum. Neither position of incubation (low hummock or hollow), nor the inorganic N concentration of the incubation environment affected mass loss. N loss was mainly determined by, and positively related to, the N/C quotient of the litter; species and stem part had minor effects. Above a N/C quotient of about 0.015, net N loss was observed for all species.
   We conclude that decomposition of Sphagnum is stimulated by N deposition. As the latter also affects litter N concentration and thus N release, we think that positive feedbacks through changing litter quality should be taken into account when modelling the effects of N deposition on Sphagnum peatlands and C sequestration in these systems.

AB Sphagnum invasion 8 years after an experimental clear-cut and mounding field trial was examined in a mesic western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) - western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) forest on the outer north coast of British Columbia. Sphagnum invasion was prominent in wet hollows in the mounded blocks. Pioneer species, Sphagnum pacificum Flatb. and Sphagnum angustifolium (C. Jens. ex Russ.) C. Jens., were common despite being minor components in the precut forest. Sphagnum girgensohnii Russ., a species of forests, showed expanding colonies and contained some Sphagnum capillifolium (Ehrh.) Hedw. Comparisons of vertical growth and decomposition rates of Sphagnum in the experimental field site and in a nearby natural peatland suggest that peat accumulation potential in the Sphagnum colonies in the mounded blocks is similar to that in the natural peatland. These observations suggest that open peatland-type plant communities become established and paludification processes are beginning. Mounding may be an effective strategy for silvicultural management to improve tree growth in the short term but may initiate paludification and negatively impact forest productivity in the long term in hypermaritime lower productivity forests.

AB Surveys of 87 sites within nine locations on Scottish agricultural land, during 1995-1997, recorded 335 species of vascular plants and 95 bryophyte species, within 31 recognisable plant communities. Multivariate analysis placed the vegetation into five main vegetation types, with differing plant species richness (S: number of species per 100 m(2)). These were upland grassland (mean S = 37); mesotrophic semi-improved grassland (mean S = 25); mire/heath vegetation (mean S = 22); intensive grassland (mean S = 12); and arable land and weed communities, including set-aside (mean S = 9).
   Management intensity was a good predictor (R-2 = 0.729) of vegetation type, with low intensity being typical of upland grassland, and high intensity typical of arable vegetation. The data were used to develop and test a set of minimal linear models of plant diversity response to land-use changes, operating at field scale, under the agro-geo-climatic conditions of mainland Scotland. The models utilised predictor variables drawn from a suite of functional vegetation attributes, environmental data, and management information. All-plant-species S was well predicted at quadrat level (i.e. within field, excluding margins) by three models with high R-2 values (0.82-0.93) utilising management variables such as crop-type, livestock density, time since last cultivation; vegetation state variables such as bryophyte cover, sward height, litter cover; and environmental variables such as soil P content. Bryophyte S was well predicted by four models with high R-2 values (0.83-0.92). Bryophyte percentage cover was the most important predictor variable in these models. Vascular plant species S was less well predicted than either all-plant-species or bryophytes-only models. The models can be used to assess the implications of land-use change scenarios, and to aid management decisions to help to maintain plant diversity within the Scottish agricultural landscape.

AB The purpose of this study was to show how current vegetation in a peatland is imprinted on the lipid fraction of the underlying soil. La Guette is a fen peatland in Central France dominated by Sphagnum spp. and ericaceous shrubs, colonized by sedges (Molinia caerulea) and trees since the 1970s (Betula pendula and Pinus sylvestris). Lipid were identified and quantified in the most abundant plants and in samples collected at the base of M. caerulea tussocks. Among relevant biomarkers, tricyclic diterpenes and methoxy-serratenes stood out as specific for P. sylvestris, betulin derivatives as specific for B. pendula, and some pentacyclic triterpene ketones and acetates as biomarkers of Ericaceae. Multivariate analysis applied to biomarker concentration in soil samples from several sites permitted distinguishing three different types of vegetation cover: (i) closed vegetation dominated by P. sylvestris; (ii) closed vegetation dominated by B. pendula and (iii) open vegetation or semi-open vegetation (early colonization by trees) comprising mainly Ericaceae, Sphagnum and graminoids. Comparison of tree-specific biomarker concentrations with estimates of tree biomass allowed establishing of quantitative relationships that were valid over at least 80 m(2) around the sampling site.

AB A field survey was carried out from April to October, 1992 in the Miyatoko Mire in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, to determine the characteristics of the microbial community and cellulose decomposition rates in the peat soil. A total of 14 study sites were selected, including three types; hummocks (type I), hollows covered with Sphagnum (type II), hollows and streams without Sphagnum (type III). The numbers of fungi (2-1,000x10(4) CFU g(-1)) and bacteria (8.5-9,000x10(5) CFU g(-1)) varied with the sites and sampling dates: seasonal fluctuations were especially high in hummocks. The numbers of cellulolytic fungi (4.7-300x10(4) CFU g(-1)) and cellulolytic bacteria (1.5-9.2x10(5) CFU g(-1)) also differed between sites. Cellulolytic fungi were predominant in the Sphagnum peat of type I, while cellulolytic: bacteria were predominant in the peat soil of type III. Decomposition rates of cellulose filter paper for the 6 month period ranged from 0.01 to 0.83, and tended to be higher in the peat of type II than type I.

AB Soil microbial communities significantly contribute to global fluxes of nutrients and carbon. Their response to climate change, including winter warming, is expected to modify these processes through direct effects on microbial functions due to osmotic stress, and changing temperature regimes. Using four European peatlands reflecting different frequencies of frost events, we show that peatland testate amoeba communities diverge among sites with different winter climates, and that this is reflected through contrasting functions. We found that exposure to harder soil frost promoted species (3-diversity (species turnover) thus shifting the community composition of testate amoebae. In particular, we found that harder soil frost, and lower water-soluble phenolic compounds, induced functional turnover through the decrease of large species (-68%, >80 mu m) and the increase of small-bodied mixotrophic species (i.e. Archerella flavum; +79%). These results suggest that increased exposure to soil frost could be highly limiting for large species while smaller species are more resistant. Furthermore, we found that beta-glucosidase enzymatic activity, in addition to soil temperature, strongly depended of the functional diversity of testate amoebae (R-2 = 0.95, ANOVA). Changing winter conditions can therefore strongly impact peatland decomposition process, though it remains unclear if these changes are carried-over to the growing season. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB With the current risks caused by sea level rise and increased extreme weather events, the study of natural coastal systems has never been more important. Erosion and anthropogenic forcing led to disappeared of the majority of coastal bogs in Europe. Here, we report on case study of a unique bog remnant still under influence by seawater which floats during storm floods. We investigated biogeochemical characteristics and discuss mechanisms that influence buoyancy, which is of vital importance for the conservation of the bog and can provide insights into the functioning of coastal bogs and potential consequences of future sea level rise. The studied area is characterized by a steep salinity gradient and marine clay deposits provide the hinge' that allows the upper peat layers to float. Our results show out that buoyancy is driven by a combinationof factors: the density differences, desiccation along the edges and methane production. If the ability to float is reduced in coastal bogs, the impact of erosion and the sum of several other processes (i.e., peat decomposition, salt stress, clay sedimentation, internal eutrophication and reduced methanogenesis) can cause a shift in environmental conditions and lead to loss of this unique habitat and its characteristic species.

AB We explore how broad-scale landscape structure (size and exposure of peatlands) influences mosquitoes (Wyeomyia smithii [Coq.]) and midges (Metriocnemus knabi Coq.) that inhabit the pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea L.) in coastal peatlands. After accounting for fine-scale (pitcher volume, water volume, detritus) and medium-scale variables (distance to peatland edge, plant density), we show that incidence and abundance of both species decrease with peatland size, but more so in peatlands surrounded by vegetation less than 2 in tall. As peatland size increases, more pitchers experience extinction of midges (but not mosquitoes) over winter, but only in peatlands surrounded by vegetation less than 2 in tall. The density of mosquitoes (but not midges) in the spring was positively related to incidence in the fall (after emergence and oviposition). There was no relationship between the cardinal orientation of the edge and incidence in either species. In a variance components analysis, maximum variance is explained at the scale of the leaf for both species, but mosquitoes show peaks in additional variance at scales broader than midges. Collectively the results suggest that broad-scale forces (interactions between demography and landscape) structure these populations at different spatial scales. We emphasize that landscape studies must be performed at sufficiently broad spatial and long temporal scales in order to capture the full range of dynamics of any system.

AB Nitrogenase activity was measured in young grey alder plantations in a peat bog in central Sweden.  The stands were treated in three ways:  (1) daily irrigation during the growing season with a complete nutrient solution, including N; (2) application of bark ash or wood ash before planting; and (3) fertilization every second year with solid PK fertilizers.  Acetylene reduction assays were performed on (1) detached nodules and attached nodules, either on (2) whole enclosed plants or (3) enclosed nodules.  The acetylene reduction rate for the enclosed plants showed a maximum in July when mean values of nearly 80-mu-mol C2H4 (g nodule dry matter)-1 h-1 were reached.  No diurnal patterns were observed.  The irrigated stands, with an N supply, showed overall nitrogenase activities that corresponded well with those of the other treatments.  Only in the case of temporarily increased soil nutrient concentrations in the irrigated stands did the nitrogenase activity fall considerably.  In 6-to 7-year-old intensively managed irrigated stands N2-fixation was estimated as 85-115 kg N ha-1 year-1 which was about 55% of the total N uptake of the trees.

AB Physical and chemical coupling of peatland vegetation, soils and landforms, and atmosphere creates feedbacks which may be important in ice-age initiation, A box diffusion CO, exchange model shows that a transient forcing of 500 Gt C (the amount proposed to have accumulated in peatlands during the last interglacial-glacial transition) over 5000 yr results in a lowering of atmospheric CO2 by about 40 ppm, Proxy data indicate that a decrease in atmospheric CO2 may have occurred over the last 5000 yr up to preindustrial times, and the amount is similar to that calculated from Holocene peatland expansion (similar to 22 ppm), These results suggest that models should consider the role of peatlands in ice-age initiation.

AB A 13,000-year history of late-quaternary vegetational and climatic change has been derived from lacustrine sediments from Pleasant Island in the Glacier Bay region of southeastern Alaska. Early arrival of lodgepole pine and mountain hemlock, indicated by the presence of pollen and conifer stomata, suggests expansion from refugia in the Alexander Archipelago. A short-term climatic reversal, possibly correlated with the European Younger Dryas, is inferred from the expansion of tundra elements and deposition of inorganic sediments between 10,600 and 9900 C-14 yr B.P. Two peat cores from the lake catchment verify Holocene vegetation changes and aid in the separation of biogenic from climatic forces affecting vegetation history. Differences in pollen representation among the three cores illustrate the variation among pollen-collecting substrates, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of peatland development and its dependence on local hydrology. Initial peat accumulation and soil paludification, occasioned by increases in temperature and precipitation in the early Holocene, allowed western and mountain hemlock to replace sitka spruce 8500-8000 yr B. P. Open muskeg became widespread about 7000 yr B. P. and allowed lodgepole pine to reinvade the region after a 2000-yr absence. The extensive replacement of fen elements by bog taxa at 3400 yr B. P. suggests increased paludification due to changing hydrologic conditions; its correlation with the upland expansion of Tsuga heterophylla suggests the onset of a cooler/wetter Neoglacial climate in southeastern Alaska.

AB Ecosystem respiration (R (eco) ) is controlled by thermal and hydrologic regimes, but their relative importance in defining the CO2 emissions in peatlands seems to be site specific. The aim of the paper is to investigate the sensitivity of R (eco) to variations in temperature and water table depth (WTD) in a wet, geogenous temperate peatland with a wide variety of vegetation community groups.
   The CO2 fluxes were measured using chambers. Measurements were made at four microsites with different vegetation communities and peat moisture and temperature conditions every 3 to 4 weeks during the period 2008-2009, 2 years with contrasting WTD patterns. Models were used to examine the relative response of each microsite to variations in peat temperature and WTD and used to estimate annual total R (eco) .
   Temporal variations in R (eco) were strongly related to peat temperature at the 5 cm depth. However, two of the microsites did not show any significant change in this relationship while two others showed contrasting responses including an increase and decrease in temperature sensitivity with deeper WTD. Average R (eco) varied among the microsites and tended to be greatest for those with greatest leaf area which also positively correlated with deeper WTD, ash content and degree of peat decomposition at 20 cm. A combined temperature and WTD model explained up to 94 % of the temporal variation in daily average R (eco) and was used to show that on an annual basis, R (eco) was between 5 and 18 % greater in the warmer year with deeper WTD.
   Microsite-specific responses were related to differences in vegetation and peat characteristics among microsites. R (eco) may have remained insensitive to WTD variations at one microsite due to the dominance of autotrophic respiration from abundant sedge biomass. At a Sphagnum-dominated microsite, a lack of response may have been due to relatively small variations in WTD that did not greatly influence microbial respiration or due to offsets between decreasing and increasing respiration rates in near-surface and deeper peat. The microsite with the most recalcitrant peat had reduced R (eco) sensitivity to temperature under more aerobic conditions while another microsite showed the opposite response, perhaps due to less nutrient availability during the wet year. Ultimately, micro-site specific models with both soil temperature and WTD as explanatory variables described temporal variations in R (eco) and highlighted the significant spatial variations in respiration rates that may occur within a single wetland.

AB Drained peatlands are significant hotspots of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and may also be more vulnerable to fire with its associated gaseous emissions. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from peatlands managed for extraction are reported on an annual basis. However, the Tier 1 (default) emission factors (EFs) provided in the IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement for this land use category may not be representative in all cases and countries are encouraged to move to higher-tier reporting levels with reduced uncertainty levels based on country- or regional-specific data. In this study, we quantified (1) CO2-C emissions from nine peat extraction sites in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, which were initially disaggregated by land use type (industrial versus domestic peat extraction), and (2) a range of GHGs that are released to the atmosphere with the burning of peat. Drainage-related methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions as well as CO2-C emissions associated with the off-site decomposition of horticultural peat were not included here. Our results show that net CO2-C emissions were strongly controlled by soil temperature at the industrial sites (bare peat) and by soil temperature and leaf area index at the vegetated domestic sites. Our derived EFs of 1.70 (+/-0.47) and 1.64 (+/-0.44) tCO(2)-C ha(-1) yr(-1) for the industrial and domestic sites respectively are considerably lower than the Tier 1 EF (2.8 +/- 1.7t CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1)) provided in the Wetlands Supplement. We propose that the difference between our derived values and the Wetlands Supplement value is due to differences in peat quality and, consequently, decomposition rates. Emissions from burning of the peat (gkg(-1) dry fuel burned) were estimated to be approximately 1346 CO2, 8.35 methane (CH4), 218 carbon monoxide (CO), 1.53 ethane (C2H6), 1.74 ethylene (C2H4), 0.60 methanol (CH3OH), 2.21 hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and 0.73 ammonia (NH3), and this emphasises the importance of understanding the full suite of trace gas emissions from biomass burning. Our results highlight the importance of generating reliable Tier 2 values for different regions and land use categories. Furthermore, given that the IPCC Tier 1 EF was only based on 20 sites (all from Canada and Fennoscandia), we suggest that data from another 9 sites significantly expand the global data set, as well as adding a new region.

AB Heterotrophic soil respiration (CO 2 efflux from the decomposition of peat and root litter) in three forestry-drained peatlands with different site types and with a large climatic gradient from the hemi-boreal (central Estonia) to south (southern Finland) and north boreal (northern Finland) conditions was studied. Instantaneous fluxes varied between 0 and 1.3 g CO2-C m(-2) h(-1), and annual fluxes between 248 and 515 g CO2-C m(-2) a(-1). Variation in the annual fluxes among site types was studied only in the south-boreal site where we found a clear increase from nutrient-poor to nutrient-rich site types. More than half of the within-site variation was temporal and explained by soil surface (-5 cm) temperature (T5). The response of soil respiration to T5 varied between the sites; the most northerly site had the highest response to T5 and the most southerly the lowest. This trend further resulted in increased annual fluxes towards north. This unexpected result is hypothesised to be related to differences in site factors like substrate quality, nutrient status and hydrology but also to temperature acclimation, i.e., adaptation of decomposer populations to different climates.

AB Knowledge about ecosystem respiration is required for accurate estimates of daily, seasonal and annual carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Measurements by the closed chamber technique were often used to calculate nighttime respiration fluxes during low-turbulence nighttime conditions when the eddy covariance method is problematic. The goal of this study is to investigate if the closed chamber measurements could also be biased during low-turbulence atmospheric conditions. We applied the closed chamber technique for measurements of CO2 flux at flark, lawn and hummock microsites at a boreal peatland (n = 602). The friction velocity (u(*)) was used for screening data into either well developed or low-turbulence conditions (u(*) <= 0.1 m s(-1)). During chamber experiments in low-turbulence nighttime conditions, the CO2 concentrations within the chamber headspace were observed to increase extremely fast and nonlinearly at the start of the chamber deployment period. The possible reason is the abrupt disturbance of the natural concentration gradients in the soils, plants and the near-surface atmosphere. This artifact leads to an overestimation of CO2 fluxes and occurs at all microsite types. However, the strongest overestimation occurs at hummocks. Consequently, we recommend that nighttime chamber measurements have to be carefully checked with respect to prevailing turbulence conditions. Under low-turbulence conditions their results can be overestimated. Since the bias is difficult to correct, chambers are probably not suitable to replace eddy covariance measurements under low-turbulence nighttime conditions, since both measurements tend to be biased.

AB Climatological measurements, including carbon dioxide flux density, were made from April to September in 1994 and from April to November in 1996 at a fen wetland near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada, as part df the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). For both years, the study period was warmer and drier than the 24-year climate normals. The period of CO2 uptake was similar for both years, reaching maximum measured assimilation rates of -0.55 mg m(-2) s(-1) in midsummer. However, warmer air temperatures and an earlier snowmelt in the spring of 1994, which led to an earlier thaw for the fen surface, and warmer and drier conditions in the fall of 1994 promoted CO2 production at times when the vascular vegetation was not photosynthesizing. As a result, in 1994 over the study period of 124 days the fen was a net source of CO2-carbon to the atmosphere, losing 30.8 g C m(-2); for the same period in 1996 the fen was a net sink of CO2-carbon, assimilating -91.6 g C m(-2). Given the immense store of carbon in boreal peatlands and given a growing understanding of the relative importance of the soil carbon pool to net ecosystem exchange and of the sensitivity of this carbon storage to temperature and wetness, this boreal fen's response to earlier spring warming and drier conditions extends our understanding of the impact of climate change on the carbon balance for northern ecosystems.

AB Changes in the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in arctic soils may influence the global carbon cycle and be an important feedback mechanism to global climate changes. In order to estimate the carbon stock and accumulation rates at Flakkerhuk on Disko Island in West Greenland, an 1800-ha study area was divided into land cover types using a satellite image. Total SOC was estimated to be on average 67.3 ton C ha(-1) (6.7 kg m(-2)) and the fen area contributing 42% of the total SOC. Soil profiles investigated at different terraces revealed that the SOC stock was significantly age-related, increasing six fold from a terrace dated to 7000 (BP) to 2 one dated to 10,000 (BP). This equals an average soil C accumulation rate of 0.5 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1). This rate was compared to vegetation-specific accumulation rates in the last 7000 yr which were in the order of 0.05 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1) in heath and sparse vegetation, 0.4 in fen areas and between 2 and 5 kg C m(-2) the last 100 yr in the present salt marsh. The study shows the importance of landscape history and age when sampling and evaluating SOC stocks and provides estimates of arctic soil C accumulation rates during Holocene versus present rates.

TI Correlation between the morphogenetic types of litter and their
   properties in bog birch forests
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB A formalized arrangement of morphogenetic types of litter according to the physicochemical parameters provided their significant grouping in three genetic associations. The litter group (highly decomposed + moderately decomposed) is confined to the tall-grass group of bog birch forests. The rhizomatous (roughly decomposed) litter is formed in the sedge-reed grass bog birch forests. The litter group (peaty + peatified + peat) is associated with the bog-herbaceous-moss group of forest types. The genetic associations of the litters (a) reliably characterize the edaphic conditions of bog birch forests and (b)correspond to formation of the peat of certain ecological groups. We found highly informative the acid-base parameters, the exchangeable cations (Ca(2+) + Mg(2+)) and the total potential acidity, which differentiated the genetic associations of litter practically with 100% probability. The expediency of studying litters under groups of forest types rather than under separate types of bog birch forests was demonstrated.

AB The effects of climatic factors and vegetation type on evapotranspiration (E) and water use efficiency (WUE) were analyzed using tower-based eddy-covariance (EC) data for nine mature forest sites, two peatland sites and one grassland site across an east-west continental-scale transect in Canada during the period 2003-2006. The seasonal pattern of E was closely linked to growing-season length and rainfall distribution. Although annual precipitation (P) during the observation period was highly variable among sites (250-1450 mm), minimum annual E was not less than 200 mm and was limited to 400-500 ram where annual P exceeded 700 mm. Site-specific interannual variability in E could be explained by either changes in total P or variations in solar irradiance. A highly positive linear correlation was found between monthly mean values of E and net radiation (R-n) at the grassland site (AB-GRL), the two peatland sites (AB-WPL and ON-EPL), and only one of the forest sites (coastal Douglas-fir, BC-DF49) whereas a hysteretic relationship at the other forest sites indicated that E lagged behind the typical seasonal progression of R-n. Results of a cross-correlation analysis between daily (24-h) E and R-n revealed that site-specific lag times were between 10 and 40 days depending on the lag of vapour pressure deficit (D) behind R-n and the decoupiing coefficient, Omega. There was significant seasonal variation in daytime mean dry-foliage Priestley-Taylor alpha with maxima occurring in the growing season at all sites except BC-DF49 where it was relatively constant (similar to 0.55) throughout all years. Annual means of daytime dry-foliage alpha mostly ranging between 0.5 and 0.7 implied stomatal limitation to transpiration. Increasing D significantly decreased canopy conductance (g(c)) at the forest sites but had little effect at the peatland and grassland sites, while variation in soil water content caused only minor changes in g(c). At all sites, a strong linear correlation between monthly mean values of gross primary production (GPP) and E resulted in water use efficiency being relatively constant. While at most sites, WUE was in the range of 2.6-3.6 g C kg(-1) H2O, the BC-DF49 site had the highest WUE of the twelve sites with values near 6.0 g C kg(-1) H2O. Of the two peatland sites. AB-WPL, a western treed fen, had a significantly higher WUE (similar to 3.0 g C kg(-1) H2O) than ON-EPL, an eastern ombrotrophic bog (similar to 1.8 g C kg(-1) H2O), which was related to peatland productivity and plant functional type.

AB The flux of ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation to the Earth's surface is increasing, particularly in high latitudes. We studied the sensitivity of some dominant plant species of boreal and subarctic peatlands to this increase.
   Intact peat monoliths with the mosses Sphagnum balticum and Sphagnum papillosum, and cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum) were exposed to ambient solar UV-B or ambient solar UV-B supplemented by 30% in a field experiment in central Finland.
   Although the UV-B dose was low during the growing season, owing to frequent cloudiness, both Sphagnum species showed significantly higher membrane permeability under enhanced UV-B. In S. balticum, UV-B tended to decrease the capitulum dry mass and induced a 30-40% increase in the concentration of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments. Enhanced UV-B had no effects on leaf morphology, chlorophyll fluorescence or stomatal functioning in E. vaginatum.
   The various UV-B responses in the Sphagnum species under investigation indicate that they may be sensitive even to small increases in solar UV-B radiation. By contrast, E. vaginatum appeared to tolerate the UV-B fluxes of the experiment.

AB Vegetation in thermally subsided peatlands (collapse scars) grades from the wettest part near the collapsing peat bank with Sphagnum riparium to successively drier conditions with S. angustifolium and S. fuscum until the peat plateau surface is reached, covered with Picea mariana-lichen woodlands. The same sequence can be found in the peat stratigraphy, where the charred surface of the treed peat plateaus (sylvic peat) is overlain by a sequence of Sphagnum riparium, S. angustifolium, and S. fuscum, capped by sylvic peat. Often several such sequences occur in the peat stratigraphy, indicating periodic permafrost degradation, triggered by fires, and regeneration. Radiocarbon dates show that such cycles can be as short as 600 yr. The earliest incidence of permafrost in the study area was dated at 3700 yr BP, indicating the end of the mid-Holocene warm period and the onset of the current climatic regime.

AB Permafrost peatland plays an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the most important components to C budgets in this system. Through the Chinese-United States EcoPartnership program, Dr Xianwei Wang, Li Sun, and Prof Changchun Song et al. from the Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof Aixin Hou from the Louisiana State University observed dynamics of DOC concentrations and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) obtained from soil porewater of permafrost peatlands for two growing seasons in the Great Hing'an Mountains, Northeast China. Soil porewater DOC concentrations varied greatly with depths during the growing season, ranging between 22.08 and 65.02 mg L-1. There was no significant relationship between DOC concentrations and SUVA(254). DOC concentrations were higher in autumn and increased as the seasonal thaw depth increased. DOC concentrations of supra-permafrost water at freeze-thaw boundary were also higher than those at the other soil depths. Temperature and thawing depth had been shown to affect DOC concentrations at different soil depths. Our finding suggests that warming and deepening of the active layer likely increase the DOC productions in the permafrost peatland, which may influence the C balance in these C-enriched ecosystems.

AB The process of the transformation of fresh organic matter (OM) into more stable and recalcitrant humic substances is still not completely clear. Understanding how OM humification evolves in northern bog environments is extremely important, especially considering that they represent one of the largest terrestrial carbon pools.
   Structural changes of OM occurring during the humification process have been generally evaluated by indirect measurements of the degree of humification. Several approaches have been used, often providing contrasting results probably because humification is a complex process that evolves differently according to varying pedoclimatic conditions.
   In the present work, the authors followed the evolution of peat OM along a 165 cm bog profile (covering the mid-to late Holocene) correlating results obtained from both organic petrological and chemical investigation. Data clearly underline a significant agreement between the two perspectives, both showing either a quite immature peat material or the presence of three distinct zones along the profile. In detail, both spectroscopic (i.e., FT-IR and three dimensional fluorescence spectra, humification indexes), and Rock-Eval pyrolysis results (low residual organic carbon content and high hydrogen and oxygen index values) showed the occurrence of a central zone (from 20-30 cm to 120 cm depth) often characterized by high heterogeneity and a low degree of humification when compared to the upper similar to 20 and bottom 40 cm sections.

AB The kinetics of methane consumption in samples of native peat from a raised sphagnum bog was studied as a function of methane concentration in the gas phase. A good agreement between the experimental data and the mathematical model was obtained by taking into account the diffusion of methane into peat micropores and by assuming that two transport systems are involved in bacterial methane consumption-one with a high (K-s1 = 43 nM) and the other with a low (K-s2 = 1.8 mu M) affinity to the substrate. Inoculation of peat samples under CH4 gave rise to exponential growth of methanotrophic microorganisms at specific rate of 0.00086 h(-1). By extrapolation to the starting point of incubation, the initial biomass of methanotrophs was estimated, which exceeded 100 mu g C/g peat.

AB The major increase in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentration during the last glacial-interglacial transition provides a useful example for understanding the interactions and feedbacks among Earth's climate, biosphere carbon cycling, and atmospheric chemistry. However, the causes of CH4 doubling during the last deglaciation are still uncertain and debated. Although the ice-core data consistently suggest a dominant contribution from northern high-latitude wetlands in the early Holocene, identifying the actual sources from the ground-based data has been elusive. Here we present data syntheses and a case study from Alaska to demonstrate the importance of northern wetlands in contributing to high atmospheric CH4 concentration in the early Holocene. Our data indicate that new peatland formation as well as peat accumulation in northern high-latitude regions increased more than threefold in the early Holocene in response to climate warming and the availability of new habitat as a result of deglaciation. Furthermore, we show that marshes and wet fens that represent early stages of wetland succession were likely more widespread in the early Holocene. These wetlands are associated with high CH4 emissions due to high primary productivity and the presence of emergent plant species that facilitate CH4 transport to the atmosphere. We argue that early wetland succession and rapid peat accumulation and expansion (not simply initiation) contributed to high CH4 emissions from northern regions, potentially contributing to the sharp rise in atmospheric CH4 at the onset of the Holocene.

AB Isotope and elemental composition of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) as well as its mass loss were measured for Sphagnum fuscum litter after one and two years of incubation in three different soil zones defined by the position of water table in a pristine Sphagnum-dominated peatland on the coast of western Canada. Mass losses were greater for the first year than for the second year, and the greatest loss was found in the oxic zone closest to the peatland surface. Early stage of decomposition clearly affected isotope signatures in Sphagnum litter. Litter delta C-13 values significantly decreased after the first year of incubation. The depletion of C-13 content during the first year might be related to the loss of more isotopically enriched soluble constituents coupled with the large mass loss. Litter delta N-15 values significantly increased after the first year of incubation in spite of the large mass loss. Litters incubated in the oxic zone had the greatest mass loss and N-15 enrichment, suggesting that the enrichment was the result of interactions with soil microbes and preferential loss of lighter N. Conversely, litters incubated in the anoxic zone had smaller mass loss and the amount of N significantly increased, suggesting that the incorporation of bacterial biomass might also contribute to the N-15 enrichment. The N-15 enrichment trend continued in the second year, but the change was not significant as the first year. Increases in the delta N-15 values with depth in the near surface Sphagnum peat core suggests that the enrichment trend of litter N-15 abundance with age is likely to continue for much longer periods than observed over the two-year period of this study.

AB Inertinite (charcoal) distributions in two randomly sampled in situ coal pillars (seams 78 and 88) from the Late Permian Kuznetsk Basin, Siberia, were analysed using petrographic techniques to determine palaeowildfire histories (fire occurrence, type and return interval). In situ coal pillars are judged to be essential for this type of research as they retain information on the original inertinite distribution and maceral clast size ranges which can never be obtained from the crushed coals typically used for petrographic analysis.
   The seams represent an ombrotrophic mire (seam 78) and mire with mire lake (seam 88) depositional settings but both environments show the same pattern of fire history. Charcoal is present in all lithotype units in both pillars. Both pillars contain episodic charcoal horizons representing local surface fires within the peat-forming environment, interspersed with frequent regional background fire events (as shown by small scattered inertinite).
   This paper presents an approach to calculating fire return intervals (FRI) in these coal pillars by removing the thickness of less compactable charcoal horizons before calculating original duration of peat formation. This is achieved by using a range of peat accumulation rates and peat to coal compaction ratios. Resultant mean FRI ranges from 7 years (extremes 0.5 to 143 years), for a lithotype unit containing 4 horizons, to 70 years (extremes 5 to 1550 years), for a lithotype unit with 2 horizons. The mid-range values both suggest shorter fire return intervals than seen in modern peat-forming environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coals are present in all types of sedimentary basins where terrestrial strata are preserved.  Many of the major coal deposits of the world, however, are in foreland basins.  These basins are optimal sites for coal accumulation because they have tectonic subsidence rates that are similar to coal accumulation rates.  Foreland basins neither subside so rapidly that mires drown below rising water tables, nor so slowly that inundation by clastics or climatic changes occur before the mires can accumulate thick peats.

AB To evaluate the seasonal and spatial variations of CH4 emissions and understand the controlling factors, we measured CH4 fluxes and their environmental variables from seven natural wetlands in mountainous regions in northeast China using a static chamber technique during a growing season from May to October in 2008. Four sites were significant atmospheric CH4 sources, ranked in order from highest to lowest according to their seasonal mean CH4 release: these sites were a marsh (34.18 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)), two deciduous forested swamps (0.83-18.21 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and a thicket swamp (0.43 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). Coniferous forested swamps, forested fens and bogs are unique wetlands in northeast China and represent large wetland coverage in this zone, but they were observed to be weak sinks of atmospheric CH4 (-0.08 to -0.01 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). Similar seasonal variations can be observed at marsh, thicket swamp and two deciduous forested swamps sites, with peaks were observed during the summer and early autumn (July to early September). However, no seasonal pattern was found at the other three sites. Seasonal variations of CH4 fluxes were primarily affected by the soil temperature. However, spatial variation among wetlands was mainly controlled by the water table, the soil temperature, plant aboveground biomass and potential CH4 production. A high water table and herb-dominant sites had high potential CH4 production rates and thus induced high CH4 fluxes. In contrast, a low water table and tree- or moss-dominant sites had low potential CH4 production rates and induced low CH4 fluxes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Boreal peatlands play a major role in carbon and water cycling and other global environmental processes but understanding this role is constrained by inconsistent representation of peatlands on, or omission from, many global land cover maps. The comparison of several widely used global and continental-scale databases on peatland distribution with a detailed map for the St. Petersburg region of Russia showed significant under-reporting of peatland area, or even total omission. Analysis of the spatial agreement and disagreement with the detailed regional map indicated that the error of comission (overestimation) was significantly lower than the error of omission (underestimation) which means, that overall, peatlands were correctly classified as such in coarse resolution datasets but a large proportion (74-99%) was overlooked. The coarse map resolution alone caused significant omission of peatlands in the study region. In comparison to categorical maps, continuous field mapping approach utilizing MODIS sensor data showed potential for a greatly improved representation of peatlands on coarse resolution maps. Analysis of spectral signatures of peatlands with different types of surface vegetation suggested that improved mapping of boreal peatlands on categorical maps is feasible. The lower reflectance of treeless peatlands in the near- and shortwave-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum is consistent with the spectral signature of sphagnum mosses. However, when trees are present, the canopy architecture appears to be more important in defining the overall spectral reflectance of peatlands. A research focus on developing remote sensing methods for boreal peatlands is needed for adequate characterization of their global distribution.

AB This study was aimed to understand the spatial variation of CH4 emissions from alpine wetlands in Southwest China on a field-scale in two phenological seasons, namely the peak growing season and the spring thaw. Methane emission rates were measured at 30 plots, which included three kinds of environmental types: dry hummock, Carex muliensis and Eleocharis valleculosa sites. There were highly spatial variations of methane emissions among and within different environmental types in both phenological seasons. Mean methane emission rates ranged from 1.1 to 37.0 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in the peak growing season and from 0.004 to 0.691 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in the spring thaw. In the peak growing season, coefficients of variation (CV) averaged 38% among environmental types and 64% within environmental types; while in the spring thaw, CV were on the average 61% among environmental types and 96% within environmental types. The key influencing factors were the standing water table and the plant community height in the peak growing season, while in the spring thaw, no significant correlations between factors and methane emissions were found.

AB Published data from different techniques used in the analysis of the main biomolecular families (lignin, carbohydrates and lipids) in 100 cm depth peat cores from the Sagnes peat bog (Limousin, France) were compared. Thermochemolysis using tetramethylammonium hydroxide was compared with the classical chemical degradation methods for lignin (CuO-NaOH oxidation) and carbohydrates (acid hydrolysis with HCl), and the Bligh and Dyer extraction method for lipids. Differences observed between the methods are mostly due to the different degradation mechanisms involved in each method. For lignin, the selective cleavage of beta-O-4 aryl ether bonds during thermochemolysis allowed identification of a more oxidized/degraded lignin pool in the deepest part of the peat core. For carbohydrates, the capacity of thermochemolysis to detect free (or terminal) carbohydrates showed an increase in microbial contribution at the interfaces between three distinct peat layers: the acrotelm, the upper part of the peat permanently above the water table; the mesotelm, the layer where water table fluctuations occur; and the catotelm, the bottom layer of peat that is permanently below the water table. For the lipid fraction, thermochemolysis revealed a lipid pool that was more influenced by microbial reworking. These results imply that, depending on the techniques used, the interpretation of the extent of degradation or source could differ. Therefore, TMAH thermochemolysis could be viewed and used as a complementary method of analysis, offering additional molecular data and contributing to a better understanding of the nature and sedimentation processes of organic matter in peat bogs.

AB Black spruce (Picea mariana) peatlands play important ecologic and economic roles in the temperate-boreal region of North America, providing a valuable timber resource while also performing important ecosystem functions. Climate models project decreases in the amount of snowfall received throughout the temperate-boreal region by 2100, as average wintertime temperatures increase. We used a paired-plot experimental design to assess the effect of snow removal on soil temperature and frost development at six forested peatland sites in northern Minnesota, USA, during the three winters from 2017 to 2020. Treatments consisted of 1) removal of snow throughout the winter, or 2) ambient snow cover conditions. During the three years of the study, there was a significant effect of snow removal by mid-winter that continued into late winter and spring, where removal of snow increased soil frost depth compared to plots with ambient snow cover treatment. Soil temperatures in the removal plots were highly responsive to air temperature fluctuations to depths of 20 cm or more, whereas the ambient snow cover soils exhibited little fluctuation and degrees maintained temperatures near or above 0 C for much of the winter season. We found that each cumulative freezing degree day resulted in an average of 0.36 cm of soil frost development in snow removal plots, as compared to 0.07 cm depth in the ambient treatment plots. Soils were significantly colder through much of the summer growing season in the removal treatment compared to the ambient treatment, with detectable soil frost in the soil profile as late as mid- to late-June. These results indicate that predicted changes in wintertime precipitation may result in increased development of soil frost in forested peatland systems, although some of this effect may be offset by predicted concurrent increases in air temperature. We did not measure indicators of biological activity, but the large and prolonged reduction in soil temperature with snow removal is likely to depress biological activity throughout the growing season and the many ecosystem functions it influences. Because of the role that soil temperature and frost play on the hydrologic and ecological processes of peatlands, as well as the crucial role of soil frost in peatland forest management, findings of this study provide important insight into the potential effects of altered winter conditions on these expansive and ecologically important ecosystems.

AB Peat lands are the most efficient carbon stores of all terrestrial ecosystems, containing approximately 455 Pg of carbon, which is twice the amount found in the world's forest biomass. The majority of this carbon is stored in the saturated peat soil. Pristine peatlands are still sequestering carbon at a rate of 0.096 Pg carbon per year; however, anthropogenic degradation of peatlands through draining, fires and exploitation can increase the production of GHGs, switching peatlands from net sinks to net sources of carbon. Conservation of peatlands throughout the UK and the rest of the world is clearly essential for limiting GHG emissions and it is therefore surprising that accounting for emissions from peatlands does not feature prominently in the UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol. Discussions at Conference of the Parties (COP) COP-15 and COP-16 look set to make amends for this oversight in any post-2012 climate change legislation, with peatlands becoming important factors in national GHG inventories, the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector, and in the creation of internationally accredited carbon credits. Using figures from The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), the world's peatlands can be valued at up to US$18 billion. However, this sum does not take into account pending UNFCCC decisions. The detailed mandatory inclusion of peatlands in national GHG inventory schemes and in accredited carbon markets could see their value rise even further. This review looks at the current GHG emission-monitoring legislation regarding peatlands, with special focus given to those in the UK. It discusses the importance of peatlands in carbon sequestration, reviews how peatlands feature in current GHG emission-monitoring schemes, concentrating on those associated with the Kyoto Protocol, and considers how peatlands may feature in national GHG emission-monitoring schemes and carbon markets in the future.

DE Peat depth; blanket peat; carbon storage; Dartmoor
ID NORTHERN SCOTLAND; CARBON
AB Inventories of peat volume and carbon storage often include general values for peat depth, but more spatially explicit and accurate estimates are required if carbon management strategies are to be developed at scales appropriate for the management. This article presents a methodology for estimating peat depth for large blanket peat areas using field sampling and GIS modelling to map peat depth on Dartmoor in south-west England. The study area was divided into carbon unit areas (CUAs) based on soil and vegetation. Approximately 1000 peat depth measurements were taken, each consisting of a mean (n = 5) from depths within a 32 m2 area. Sampling points were stratified according to CUA area and proportional extent of slope and elevation classes. Regression analyses were used to determine the relationships between slope, elevation and peat depth within each CUA. The strongest relationship was for blanket peat (r2 = 0.53), with weaker ones for areas where peat was shallow and depth was less variable. A digital elevation model was used in a GIS to model peat depths for the whole of Dartmoor. Results were tested against a data set of 200 peat depths on a 250 m grid covering 1325 ha. We conclude that peat depth can be modelled using easily available topographic data combined with well-designed field sampling over larger spatial scales. The approach can result in accurate mapping of peat depth and carbon storage for blanket peatlands in the United Kingdom and perhaps also elsewhere.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the interannual variation during 1981-1997 in methane emission from an oligotrophic lawn plant community in a boreal mire. Daily mean air temperatures and daily accumulated precipitation figures were used as forcing variables for a mechanistic soil physical model, to generate estimates for the depths of snow, soil frost, and water table, together with soil temperature profiles. Methane emissions were then simulated with a mechanistic mixed mire methane model, described in this paper. The methane model simulated total methane emission rates separated into diffusion, ebullition, and plant-mediated transport. The climate record for 1981-1997 represented almost the total range in growing season temperature sums in northern Sweden during the twentieth century. The average temperature sum for 1980-1997 was 735 (range 553-981) degree days. The average accumulated annual precipitation during the same period was 283 (range 140-397) mm. The integrated simulated annual methane emission during 1981-1997 varied almost threefold among years, with a mean of 17.4 +/- 1.1 (SE) and a range of 11 to 27 g m(-2). The simulated annual emissions for the three calibration years 1995-1997 were 18, 14, and 22 g m(-2), respectively, slightly higher than the integrated measured emissions over the growing season (May-September), which were 16, 13, and 18 g m(-2) y(-1), respectively. Given the model formulation and parameterization, the single most important climatic predictor of simulated annual methane emission was mean water table position (r(2) = 0.58). Adding annual soil temperature sum at 26 cm in a multiple regression solution significantly increased the explained variance (R-2 = 0.85). The study emphasizes that interannual variability in methane emission may be large, and therefore extrapolations of annual methane emissions must be based on time series that adequately span the interannual variability in the local climate.

AB The fate of Northern peatlands under climate change is important because of their contribution to global carbon (C) storage. Peatlands are maintained via greater plant productivity (especially of Sphagnum species) than decomposition, and the processes involved are strongly mediated by climate. Although some studies predict that warming will relax constraints on decomposition, leading to decreased C sequestration, others predict increases in productivity and thus increases in C sequestration. We explored the lack of congruence between these predictions using single-species and integrated species distribution models as proxies for understanding the environmental correlates of North American Sphagnum peatland occurrence and how projected changes to the environment might influence these peatlands under climate change. Using Maximum entropy and BIOMOD modelling platforms, we generated single and integrated species distribution models for four common Sphagnum species in North America under current climate and a 2050 climate scenario projected by three general circulation models. We evaluated the environmental correlates of the models and explored the disparities in niche breadth, niche overlap, and climate suitability among current and future models. The models consistently show that Sphagnum peatland distribution is influenced by the balance between soil moisture deficit and temperature of the driest quarter-year. The models identify the east and west coasts of North America as the core climate space for Sphagnum peatland distribution. The models show that, at least in the immediate future, the area of suitable climate for Sphagnum peatland could expand. This result suggests that projected warming would be balanced effectively by the anticipated increase in precipitation, which would increase Sphagnum productivity.

AB Data from four components of the radiation balance were used to investigate the surface energy budgets for a Carex lasiocarpa mire in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, and the controlling factors of the evapotranspiration (ET) were discussed in detail. During the growing season 2006, the shortwave radiation (SWa dagger") reaching the mire surface added up to 2,854.3 MJ m(-2) and the net radiation (Rn) was 1,637.4 MJ m(-2) in total, with an average of 9.86 MJ m(-2) day(-1). G was the smallest flux at the water-atmosphere interface, with an average of about 0.91 MJ m(-2) day(-1), but showed high relative variability, even changing its sign. The latent and sensible heat fluxes (LE and H) amounted to 787.48 and 476.26 MJ m(-2), respectively, and the total sum of LE and H accounted for 77.18% of Rn. By conversion from LE, the average value of ET from the mire was 1.84 mm day(-1), amounting to 298.8 mm. The total ET was almost 60% of the total rainfall in the same period, proving that ET is the primary water consumer in the mire. The growth of C. lasiocarpa was related closely with surface resistance (r (s)), and analysis of partial correlation indicated that r (s) correlated negatively with leaf area index (LAI) when the interference of the available energy, Rn-G, was removed. There was a strong linkage between r (s) and the evaporative fraction [LE/(LE + H)] as well as Bowen ratio (beta). r (s) was the key factor in controlling the variation of ET and regulating energy partitioning between LE and H. During the whole growing season, r (s) and R (n)-G were the two main factors coupled in ET processes. In spring, r (s) dominated ET processes, and the increase in LAI led to a decrease in r (s), which in turn accelerated ET as vegetation developed until late August. After August, the available energy controlled the process of ET completely until ET reached an equilibrium in mid-October.

AB Climate change projections show that temperature and precipitation increases can alter the exchange of greenhouse gases between the atmosphere and high latitude landscapes, including their freshwaters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an important role in greenhouse gas emissions, but the impact of catchment productivity on DOC release to subarctic waters remains poorly known, especially at regional scales. We test the hypothesis that increased terrestrial productivity, as indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), generates higher stream DOC concentrations in the Stordalen catchment in subarctic Sweden. Furthermore, we aimed to determine the degree to which other generic catchment properties (elevation, slope) explain DOC concentration, and whether or not land cover variables representing the local vegetation type (e.g., mire, forest) need to be included to obtain adequate predictive models for DOC delivered into rivers. We show that the land cover type, especially the proportion of mire, played a dominant role in the catchment's release of DOC, while NDVI, slope, and elevation were supporting predictor variables. The NDVI as a single predictor showed weak and inconsistent relationships to DOC concentrations in recipient waters, yet NDVI was a significant positive regulator of DOC in multiple regression models that included land cover variables. Our study illustrates that vegetation type exerts primary control in DOC regulation in Stordalen, while productivity (NDVI) is of secondary importance. Thus, predictive multiple linear regression models for DOC can be utilized combining these different types of explanatory variables.

AB The purpose of this research was to use empirical models to monitor temporal dynamics of soil moisture in a peatland using remotely sensed imagery, and to determine the predictive accuracy of the approach on dates outside the time series through statistically independent validation. A time series of seven Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were collected along with concurrent field measurements of soil moisture over one growing season, and soil moisture retrieval was tested using Linear Mixed Effects models (LMEs). A single-date airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey was incorporated into the analysis, along with temporally varying environmental covariates (Drought Code, Time Since Last Rain, Day of Year). LMEs allowed repeated measures to be accounted for at individual sampling sites, as well as soil moisture differences associated with peatland classes. Covariates provided a large amount of explanatory power in models; however, SAR imagery contributed to only a moderate improvement in soil moisture predictions (marginal R-2 = 0.07; conditional R-2 = 0.7, independently validated R-2 = 0.36). The use of LMEs allows for a more accurate characterization of soil moisture as a function of specific measurement sites, peatland classes and measurement dates on model strength and predictive power. For intensively monitored peatlands, SAR data is best analyzed in conjunction with peatland Class (e.g., derived from an ecosystem classification map) to estimate the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture, provided there is a ground-based monitoring network with a sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to fit the LME models.

AB Landscape-scale net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and the energy balance of a subarctic fen were studied during five growing seasons near Churchill, Manitoba. Interannual variability in NEE was large and ranged from a net sink of -235 g CO2 m(-2) in 1996 to a net source of +76 g CO2 m(-2) in 1994, Annual estimates of CO2 exchange indicate that during the present period the fen is losing carbon nearly 3 times faster than its long-term historical gain of about -11 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). Our estimates suggest that gross ecosystem photosynthesis may be more variable than ecosystem respiration on diurnal, seasonal, and interannual timescales. Our data strongly indicate that an early snowmelt combined with wet and warm conditions during the spring period lead to large carbon acquisition even when drier conditions were experienced over the majority of the growing season. The phenological stage of the vegetation relative to the climatic conditions experienced is an important cause of the interannual variability in NEE. An accurate representation of phenology in climate models is, therefore, critical to the success of forecasting the carbon budgets of northern wetlands.

AB Canada's forest and peatland ecosystems are globally significant carbon stores, whose management will be influenced by climate change mitigation policies such as offset systems. To be effective, these policies must be grounded in objective information on the relationships between land use, ecosystem carbon dynamics, and climate. Here, we present the outcomes of a workshop where forest, peatland, and climate experts were tasked with identifying management actions required to maintain the role of Canada's forest and peatland ecosystems in climate regulation. Reflecting the desire to maintain the carbon storage roles of these ecosystems, a diverse set of management actions is proposed, incorporating conservation, forest management, and forest products.

AB Increasing mercury deposition rates in the Northern Hemisphere recorded in natural archives such as peat bogs or lake sediments have been documented in numerous studies. However, data on atmospheric Hg deposition in the Southern Hemisphere dating back to pre-industrial times are rare. Here, we provide a continuous record of atmospheric Hg deposition in the Southern Hemisphere recorded by an ombrotrophic peat bog of the Magellanic Moorlands, Chile (53degreesS), extending back 3000 yr. Pre-industrial mercury accumulation rates range between 2.5 and 3.9 mug/m(2)/yr. In the past 100 yr, Hg accumulation rates increased 18-fold from about 3 mug/m(2)/yr to a maximum of 62.5 mug/m(2)/yr. If Hg accumulation rates were normalized to peat accumulation rates, maximum rates were 7.9 mug/m(2)/yr, which is only 2.5 times the pre-industrial rates. Thus, Hg accumulation rates normalized to peat accumulation rates are more comparable to the three-fold net increase in atmospheric Hg concentrations estimated for the same period. We suggest that the increase in Hg accumulation rates in the Magellanic Moorlands within the past 100 yr is at least partly attributed to global dispersion of Hg derived from anthropogenic sources in the Northern Hemisphere. The finding that no increase of atmospheric deposition of Pb could be observed in the bog indicates the extraordinary long-range transport and ubiquitous dispersion of anthropogenic derived gaseous Hg compared to other metals.

AB Degradation of ecosystems is a great concern on the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Ecological restoration fights degradation aiming at the recovery of ecosystem functions such as carbon (C) sequestration and ecosystem structures like plant communities responsible for the C sequestration function. We selected 38 pristine, drained and restored boreal peatland sites in Finland and asked i) what is the long-term effect of drainage on the peatland surface layer C storage, ii) can restoration recover ecosystem functioning (surface layer growth) and structure (plant community composition) and iii) is the recovery of the original structure needed for the recovery of ecosystem functions? We found that drainage had resulted in a substantial net loss of C from surface layer of drained sites. Restoration was successful in regaining natural growth rate in the peatland surface layer already within 5 years after restoration. However, the regenerated surface layer sequestered C at a mean rate of 116.3 g m(-2) yr(-1) (SE 12.7), when a comparable short-term rate was 178.2 g m(-2) yr(-1) (SE 13.3) at the pristine sites. The plant community compositions of the restored sites were considerably dissimilar to those of pristine sites still 10 years after restoration. We conclude that ecological restoration can be used to jump-start some key peatland ecosystem functions even without the recovery of original ecosystem structure (plant community composition). However, the re-establishment of other functions like C sequestration may require more profound recovery of conditions and ecosystem structure. We discuss the potential economic value of restored peatland ecosystems from the perspective of their C sequestration function. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Habitat alteration can deteriorate plant-pollinator interactions and thereby increase the risk of population extinction. As part of a larger study on the effects of changes in land use on fen grassland vegetation, factors influencing the seed set of a short-lived, endangered wetland plant, Pedicularis palustris, were studied. We conducted field pollination experiments in one large and one small population. To investigate the effect of pollen source on seed set, individual flowers of caged plants were left unpollinated or were pollinated with pollen from the same flower, the same population or another population. To study pollen limitation and flower display, whole plants were subjected to pollinator exclosure, hand pollination or natural pollination. Self-compatibility was high, but differed between populations (61% and 97% of seed set after cross-pollination within populations). Cross-pollination between populations did not significantly alter seed number per capsule. Pollinator exclosure resulted in a very low seed set (<15% of natural seed set), despite high self-compatibility. The most likely explanations for high self-compatibility in combination with low autofertility are geitonogamy as reproductive assurance, selective neutrality of self-compatibility and phylogenetic constraints. Because of low autofertility, the seed set in P. palustris depends on pollinators. In the study populations, natural pollination was clearly sufficient for maximum seed production per plant, but seed set per capsule was significantly pollen-limited in the smaller population. Plants in this population also had a higher maximum percentage of simultaneously open flowers than those of the large population (31% vs. 13%), while flower longevity was generally extended without pollination. It is concluded that P palustris may influence pollinator behaviour and therefore the risk of pollen limitation by flower display. P. palustris showed a flexible reaction to differing pollination regimes without losses in overall seed set in the study populations.

AB Questions: Are there changes in species composition of the oceanic, Low-Arctic tundra vegetation after 40 years? Can possible changes be attributed to climate change?
   Location: Ammassalik Island near Tasiilaq, Southeast Greenland.
   Methods: Species composition and cover of 11 key vegetation types were recorded in 110 vegetation survey plots in 1968-1969 and in 11 permanent plots in 1981. Recording was repeated in 2007. Temporal changes in species composition and cover between the surveys were tested using permutation tests linked with constrained ordinations for vegetation types, and Mann-Whitney tests for individual species. Changes in vegetation were related to climate change.
   Results: Although climate became warmer over the studied period, most of the vegetation types showed minor changes. The changes were most conspicuous in mire and snowbed vegetation, such as the Carex rariflora mire and Hylocomium splendens snowbed. In the C. rariflora mire, species number and cover of vascular plants and cover of bryophytes increased, whereas in the H. splendens snowbed species numbers of vascular plants, bryophytes, and also lichens increased. Lichen richness increased in the Carex bigelowii snowbed and cover of bryophytes in the Salix herbacea snowbed. No such changes occurred in the Alchemilla glomerulans meadow, Alchemilla alpina snowbed and Phyllodoce coerulea heath. There was no change of species composition within the Salix glauca scrub, A. alpina snowbed, lichen grassland and the Empetrum nigrum and Phyllodoce coerulea heaths. Most changes resulted from increasing frequency or cover of some species; there were very few decreasing species. Most of the increasing species indicate drier substrate conditions.
   Conclusions: Only minor changes in species composition and cover were detected in the vegetation types studied. These changes were probably caused by milder winters and warmer summers during the years before the 2007 sampling. Climate warming may have reduced the duration of snow cover and soil moisture, particularly in snowbed and mire habitats, where species composition change was most pronounced. However, its magnitude was insufficient to cause a major change in species composition. Thus, on the level of plant community types, tundra vegetation near Tasiilaq was rather stable over the last 40 years.

AB Peatlands after drainage and extraction are large sources of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. Restoration, through re-wetting and revegetation, aims to return the C sink function by re-establishing conditions similar to that of an undrained peatland. However, the time needed to re-establish C sequestration is not well constrained due to the lack of multi-year measurements. We measured over 3 years the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), methane (FCH4), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at a restored post-extraction peatland (RES) in southeast Canada (restored 14 years prior to the start of the study) and compared our observations to the C balance of an intact reference peatland (REF) that has a long-term continuous flux record and is in the same climate zone. Small but significant differences in winter respiration driven by temperature were mainly responsible for differences in cumulative NEE between years. Low growing season inter-annual variability was linked to constancy of the initial spring water table position, controlled by the blocked drainage ditches and the presence of water storage structures (bunds and pools). Half-hour FCH4 at RES was small except when Typha latifolia-invaded drainage ditches were in the tower footprint; this effect at the ecosystem level was small as ditches represent a minor fraction of RES. The restored peatland was an annual sink for CO2 (-90 +/- 18 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a source of CH4 (4.4 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and a source of DOC (6.9 +/- 2.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)), resulting in mean net ecosystem uptake of 78 +/- 17 g C m(-2) year(-1). Annual NEE at RES was most similar to wetter, more productive years at REF. Integrating structures to increase water retention, alongside re-establishing key species, have been effective at re-establishing the net C sink rate to that of an intact peatland.

AB An integrated assessment of the ecological state and stability of permafrost peat plateaus in northeastern European Russia has been performed with regard to current climate changes. Analytical studies have revealed heterogeneity in the composition and properties of peat organic matter in active and permafrost layers. Permafrost organic matter in peatlands is relatively undecomposed, and, theoretically, its rapid mineralization can begin upon peat thawing. Organic carbon in peatlands has not been frozen or conserved during about 64-78% of their total lifetime; therefore, it is the existence of anaerobic conditions (rather than of permafrost) that has been the most important factor for peat accumulation. Current degradation of permafrost peat plateaus is caused mainly by wind and thermal erosion but practically does not lead to the development of thermokarst. Regardless of current climate warming, peat plateaus under natural conditions (not altered by human activities) are stable ecological systems.

AB Catenosynnema micheliae gen. et sp. nov. and Oedemium micheliae sp. nov. are described from dead woody litter of Michelia baillonii (Magnoliaceae) collected from Doi Suthep-Pui National Park, Thailand. The novel anamorphic genus, Catenosynnema is characterised by synnematous conidiophores and subhyaline to pale brown, catenate conidia. The genus is similar to the anamorphic genera Seifertia and Sorocybe, both of which have catenate conidia, but differs in that its synnemata are paler in colour and of a different form. The second anamorphic taxon, Oedemium micheliae sp. nov. is distinct from other species in the genus in having conidia in short chains and possessing secondary conidiogenous ampullae. The new taxa are described, illustrated and compared with morphologically similar anamorphic fungi.

AB [1] Mires are key landscape elements at high latitudes and have certainly accumulated carbon during the Holocene, but their current carbon balance at the present time is very unclear. The major carbon flux is the land-atmosphere CO2 exchange and full-year data are still limited. Here we present data from 3 a (2001-2003) of continuous Eddy Covariance measurements at Degero Stormyr (64 degrees 11'N, 19 degrees 33'E) an oligotrophic, minerotrophic mire in Sweden. The climate at the site is defined as cold temperate humid, with 30-a annual precipitation and temperature means of 523 mm and +1.2 degrees C, respectively, while the mean temperatures in July and January are +14.7 degrees C and -12.4 degrees C, respectively. The length of the vegetation period was 153 +/- 15 d during the measured years. The minerotrophic mire represented a net sink for the vertical exchange of atmospheric CO2-C during the 3 a, with an average net uptake of 55 +/- 7 g ( mean +/- SD) CO2-C m(-2) a(-1). The growing season average uptake was 92 +/- 10 g CO2-C m(-2), of which approximately 40% ( 37 +/- 5 g CO2-C m(-2)) was lost during the nongrowing season. The daily average uptake over the growing season was 0.65 +/- 0.57, 0.73 +/- 0.61, and 0.68 +/- 0.62 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) in 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively. The daily average net uptake for the month with highest uptake was 1.10 +/- 0.33, 1.11 +/- 0.63, and 1.22 +/- 0.55 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) in July 2001, July 2002, and June 2003, respectively. The daily average efflux during the nongrowing season was 0.14 +/- 0.28, 0.15 +/- 0.20, and 0.20 +/- 0.19 g CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) in the years 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively.

AB Ombrotrophic peatlands often lack any substantial local mineral component and therefore present exceptional opportunities for the extraction and identification of tephra horizons. Following concerns of shard geochemistry alteration during isolation using acid digestion, an alternative methodology using heavy liquids has been proposed. However, harsh basic and acidic digestions are rarely required in organic-rich, ombrotrophic peatlands. Consequently, this study tested for geochemical differences between tephra shards from a known rhyolitic eruption, isolated from the same stratigraphic depth of a peat sequence using density separation and an acid digestion methodology typically applied to ombrotrophic peat samples and analysed using electron probe microanalysis. Findings suggest that the two samples could not be geochemically distinguished using visual and statistical methods and that, in the context of rhyolitic tephras in ombrotrophic peats, acid digestion can be used without significant effects on the interpretation of results. Density separation may still be required in peatlands with high mineral input and further work is required to examine the effect of the acid digestion technique on tephra of non-rhyolitic compositions.

AB Relevance of the research is determined by the necessity to account the interrelations between distribution of chemical elements on peat deposit depth, formation, evolution and degradation of bogs when solving a number of fundamental and applied problems of study, use and protection of bogs. The aim of the research is the estimation of microbiological conditions of chemical elements distribution on peat deposit depth and revealing of relations between geochemical and microbiological parameters of peats in east part of the Vasyugan svvamp. Methods: methods of chemical and microbiological analysis (including MS-1CP), statistical methods. Results and conclusions. The authors have carried out chemical, mineralogical and microbiological analysis of peats and mineral ground samples. The samples were selected on the 9 of November, 2018 in east part of the Vasyugan swamp (border of a watershed of the Klyuch and Gavrilovka rivers which are the elements of a river network ( Klyuch-Bakchar; Gavrilovka-lksa-Chaya-01; intrasvvamp ecological systems: the oligotrophic ho/low-ridge complex, a ridge; the oligotrophic pine -dwarf -shrub -sphagnum raised bog (ryam), the mesotrophic border of an oligotrophic bog). It is shown that, first, the swamp micro flora is a very important factor of chemical elements distribution on peat deposit depth in various intraswamp ecosystems in east part of the Vasyugan swamp. The probability of accumulation insoluble compounds of calcium, iron and rare earth elements in peats grows in amplification of micro flora development unaerobic conditions. These factors determine increase of pH up to 7,8 and higher, that results in displacement carbonate balance and loss of insoluble calcium compounds. Second, the opportunity of iron hydroxides removing from a solution is the prominent feature of geochemistry of peat bogs on a background insignificant, but constantly observable activity of iron bacteria, which formed iron hydroxides. Thirdly, owing to sorption (and insoluble calcium compounds in the bottom layers of a peat deposit) hydrooxides, phosphates and carbonates (possibly sulfates and sulfides) of some microelements, including rare earth elements, are precipitated on iron hydrooxides.

AB Peatlands can accumulate organic matter into long-term carbon (C) storage within the soil profile. This study used solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13-NMR) to investigate the transit of organic C through a peatland ecosystem to understand the molecular budget that accompanies the long-term accumulation of C. Samples of biomass, litter, peat soil profile, particulate organic matter, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were taken from the Moor House National Nature Reserve, a peat-covered catchment in northern England where both the dry matter and C budget for the ecosystem were known. The results showed that: The interpretation of the C-13-NMR spectra shows that polysaccharides are preferentially removed through the ecosystem, while lignin components are preferentially retained and come to dominate the organic matter accumulated at depth in the profile. The DOM is derived from the oxidation of both biomass and the degradation of lignin, while the particulate organic matter is derived from erosion of the peat profile. The DOM is differentiated by its proportion of oxidized functional groups and not by its aromatic content. The changes in functionality leading to DOM production suggest side chain oxidation resulting in C-C cleavage/depolymerisation of lignin, a common reaction within white rot fungi. The C-13-NMR budget shows that O-alkyl functional groups are disproportionately lost between primary production and accumulation in the deep peat, while C-alkyl functional groups are disproportionately preserved. The carbon lost as gases (CO2 and CH4) was estimated to be composed of 93% polysaccharide-derived carbon and 7% lignin-derived carbon.

AB The grain-size distribution characteristics and grain-size parameters of sediment in two vertical sections of Daniugou peatland in the Changbai Mountains were systematically investigated. A comparative analysis of the sediment granularity using a discriminative function with Hongyuan peat, red clay, loess-paleosol, fluvial deposit as well as lacustrine deposit was also conducted. It turns out that the vertical section of Daniugou peat ash is primarily constituted by clay and silt particles, and the content of sand is relatively small. Grain-size frequency curves generally show a single-peak modality while a bimodal pattern is detected in the upper layer. The grain-size component and peak pattern of grain-size frequency curves also illustrate that peat ash materials were transported to the peatland by long-range aeolian dust during the deposition process, while there existed short-distance dust influence in peat deposition of the upper layer. Comparisons of grain-size parameters and the discriminative Y-value of Daniugou peat ash with those of typical aeolian sediments show close similarities, suggesting the possibility that atmospheric dust transport processes were involved in the accumulation of peat again. Moreover, the variations of grain-size distribution suggest the local environmental deterioration which is just the driving force of local dust elevation. Grain-size analysis of peatland sediment is demonstrated to be one effective method to extract information about regional and global environmental evolution, and more attention should be paid to current local ecological environment and to seeking a balance between economic development and environmental protection in Northeast China.

AB The clear dependence of N2O production through denitrification on available nitrate (NO3) in soil has been shown in many studies. Since N availability similarly limits the growth of plants, the resource competition with vegetation limits the activity of denitrifying microbes and may consequently moderate the N2O emissions from peatlands. We used NO3 uptake by Eriophorum vaginatum L. as a vegetation competition factor for microbes. The species was selected for the experiment because it has high nutrient use efficiency in low-nutrient conditions and high nutrient uptake efficiency in luxuriant nutrient conditions. We measured gaseous N flux as N2O (end product of denitrifier activity) in a restored peatland in central Finland with acetylene inhibition technique over a growing season from sample plots with varying NO3 addition levels and E. vaginatum cover. The resource competition effects were analysed with a model that used exponential decay dependence of N2O flux on the leaf area of E. vaginatum, and saturating response of N2O flux to NO3 addition level. The model explained the variation in N2O fluxes well (R-2=0.86). The model simulation showed that the increasing nutrient uptake of E. vaginatum decreased the N2O fluxes exponentially. Simultaneously, denitrification appeared to saturate even in conditions with high availability of NO3 and low level of competition by vegetation. Thus, E. vaginatum is an effective competitor for NO3 in sedge-dominated peatlands that controls the availability of NO3- for denitrification, and consequently moderates the N2O emissions from peatlands.

AB Ecosystem-scale methane (CH4) flux (F-CH4) over a subarctic fen at Churchill, Manitoba, Canada was measured to understand the magnitude of emissions during spring and fall shoulder seasons, and the growing season in relation to physical and biological conditions. F-CH4 was measured using eddy covariance with a closed-path analyser in four years (2008-2011). Cumulative measured annual F-CH4 (shoulder plus growing seasons) ranged from 3.0 to 9.6 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) among the four study years, with a mean of 6.5 to 7.1 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) depending upon gap-filling method. Soil temperatures to depths of 50 cm and air temperature were highly correlated with F-CH4, with near-surface soil temperature at 5 cm most correlated across spring, fall, and the shoulder and growing seasons. The response of F-CH4 to soil temperature at the 5 cm depth and air temperature was more than double in spring to that of fall. Emission episodes were generally not observed during spring thaw. Growing season emissions also depended upon soil and air temperatures but the water table also exerted influence, with F-CH4 highest when water was 2-13 cm below and lowest when it was at or above the mean peat surface.

AB Ecosystem phenology plays an important role in carbon exchange processes and can be derived from continuous records of carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange data. In this study we examined the potential use of phenological indices for characterizing cumulative annual CO2 exchange in four contrasting northern peatland ecosystems. We used the approach of Jonsson and Eklundh (2004) to derive a set of phenological indices based on the daily time series of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-e), and net ecosystem production (NEP) measured in the four peatland sites. The main objectives of this study were (a) to examine the variation in phenological indices across sites and (b) to determine the relationships among phenological indices, environmental conditions, and cumulative annual CO2 exchange. The phenological index used to define the "start of the growing season" showed good potential for differentiation among sites based on their average annual site GPP. Sites with earlier growing seasons had the highest average annual site GPP. The "peak CO2 exchange rate" phenological index performed best in reflecting variations among sites and for estimating annual values of GPP, R-e, and NEP (Pearson correlation coefficients ranged between 0.77 and 0.99, p<0.05 for all.). The phenological indices and annual GPP, R-e, and NEP were sensitive to winter (January-March) and summer (July-September) temperature and precipitation, but correlations, though significant, were weak.

AB The hydraulic properties of fen peat soils from the Biebrza River Valley in the north-east of Poland were investigated. 87 soil samples were collected from nine typical peat-moorsh soil profiles representing three types of peat: moss with fibrous structure, herbaceous and wooden peat characterised by amorphous structure with high humus content. The multi-step outflow method was used to determine the parameters of the Mualem-van Genuchten model (MVG) that describes soil moisture retention characteristics and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function of each soil sample. The agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis of the parameters of MVG model was applied in order to obtain typical hydraulic functions for the three types of peat considered. As a result of the analysis, the hydraulic properties of the fen peat soils were agglomerated into five clusters. The MVG model parameters as well as hydraulic functions were analysed for distinguished clusters. The parameters of the moss peats with low degree of decomposition and fibric structure were different from those of the herbaceous and wooden decomposed peats with high humus content. The largest values of the hydraulically active pore space (difference between saturated and residual moisture content) were observed for moss peat samples, while the lowest values were observed for wooden peat samples. The empirical parameters describing the shape of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function Were depended on the type of the peat and therefore the degree of decomposition. The L parameter values of the herbaceous and wooden pears were generally greater than 0, whereas for the moss peat samples they were ranging from -5 to 5. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the herbaceous and wooden peat soils was close to that of very fine-textured mineral soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB C dynamics in soils plays an important role in the interactions between climate and terrestrial ecosystems. Given the importance of the soil C pool in future climate scenarios, accurate models that can then be integrated into global models are required. On the one hand, models of soil C dynamics can be very simplistic in that only solid organic matter (OM) is taken into account with constant rates. Such models can miss important features of soil C dynamics such as enzymatic activity and CO2 production. On the other hand, some models are too complicated to be experimentally calibrated, tested, and widely used. We propose a model of soil C dynamics that (i) integrates all C fluxes from the solid to the gaseous form, and (ii) can be easily implemented experimentally. Because peatlands are important C stores that are experiencing vegetation changes, the model was tested on experimental results obtained with peatland litter: Sphagnum cuspidatum (autochtonous vegetation), Molinia caerulea, and Betula spp. (both invasive species). Our model was able to accurately describe the early stages of C dynamics in litter especially when only one pool of OM was used and when catalysis and respiration rates were allowed to decrease with time. Our model is efficient in assessing the entire actual catalysis rate. This is a notable achievement as usually, enzyme activity is measured on specific enzymes in conditions often far from actual ones. Our model appeared to be sufficiently robust and worthy of development, keeping in mind that it should remain experimentally testable.

AB Many studies carried out during these last few years have focused on the factors influencing plant diversity in species-rich grasslands. This is due to the fact that these ecosystems, among the most diversified in temperate climates, are extremely threatened; in some areas, they have almost disappeared. The re-establishment of these habitats implies to know the living conditions of the associations to be recreated. Very often, the typical species of these communities have become so rarefied that the seed bank or the seed rain are not sufficient to recreate the plant community. Most of the time, to achieve the restoration of these communities, they have to be totally recreated by sowing. For the restoration or the maintenance of the community, the soil chemical characteristics have also to be appropriate or if not modified. This research tends to establish a relation between some soil chemical factors and the plant diversity of a great number of stations. This research has illuminated the relationship between soil extractable phosphorus and potassium and plant diversity. Over 5 mg of phosphorus per 100 g of dry soil (acetate + EDTA extraction), no station containing more than 20 species per 100 m(2) has been found. The highest number of species is found below the optimum content of the soil for plant nutrition (5-8 mg P/100 g). Concerning the potassium, the highest number of species is found at 20 mg/100, a value corresponcing to an optimum content of the soil for plant nutrition. High potassium contents, in opposition to phosphorus contents, are thus compatible with high values of diversity. Other factors (i.e. pH, organic matter, total nitrogen and calcium) do not show so clearly a relation with plant diversity. Excess of N-NO3 is known for its negative effect on the diversity of plant communities. In these environments, apart from the atmospheric deposits which can be important in some areas, N-NO3 is derived mainly from the symbiotic fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by legumes as well as from the mineralization of the organic matter of the soil. It is possible that, when in small quantities, the available soil phosphorus could be a limiting factor of the N-NO3 supply by these two sources. In this hypothesis, nitrogen would remain the main element limitating plant diversity but its availability would be controlled by phosphorus.

AB Lowland ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands are a declining ecological resource in Europe. Peatlands display characteristic patterns in vegetation and surface topography, linked to ecological function, hydrology, biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Laser scanning provides a means of precisely measuring vegetation pattern in peatlands, and thus holds promise as a tool for monitoring peatland condition. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was used for measurement of vegetation pattern along an eco-hydrological gradient at a UK peatland (Wedholme Flow, Cumbria) at fine grain sizes (< 1 cm spatial resolution over 10 m spatial extent). Seven sites were investigated-each showed varying water table and ecological characteristics. TLS data were analysed using semi-variogram analysis which enabled the scale of spatial dependence in vegetation structures to be measured. In addition ecological, hydrological and positional surveys were conducted to elucidate interpretation of spatial patterns. Results show that TLS was able to rapidly measure vegetation patterns associated with eco-hydrological condition classes. Intact sites with hummock-hollow topography showed an isotropic pattern with a grain size or length-scale of 1 m or less (indicated by semi-variogram range). Degraded sites with high shrub cover showed increased sill variance values at larger range distances-typically around 3-4 m. The work presented shows the advantages of TLS methodologies for rapid measurement of 3-D vegetation canopy structure and surface microtopography, at fine spatial scales, in short vegetation. The paper considers how these approaches may be extended to monitoring peatland structure over larger spatial extents from airborne LiDAR systems.

AB The Tea Bag Index (TBI) method was used to estimate the litter decomposition rate in peatland exposed for climate manipulation (increased temperature and reduced precipitation) at two contrasting sites differing in water table depth (WTD) dynamics. To manipulate climate on peatland, the prototyped Open Top Chambers (OTC) and automated rain-out shelters were used. OTCs increased daytime air temperatures by similar to 1.7 degrees C at the driest plots exposed for an increase of air temperature and reduced precipitation, while the increase of the average daily air temperature was lower than 0.9 degrees C. However, OTCs cooled down the peat temperature even by 0.8 degrees C and this effect was most pronounced for daytime rather than night-time conditions. The precipitation amount was reduced by 26%. The tea bags were buried at 8 cm depth for 83 and 172 days starting from the 19th of April 2019. Our observation proved that although decomposition rates were dependent on temperature, WTD and its fluctuations are the main factors controlling the rates of litter decomposition in waterlogged ecosystems like ours. At waterlogged Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, the interrelation between different environmental factors may mitigate the impact of warming and reduced precipitation on litter decomposition.

AB The effect of moderate rates of nitrogen deposition on ground floor vegetation is poorly predicted by uncontrolled surveys or fertilization experiments using high rates of nitrogen (N) addition. We compared the temporal trends of ground floor vegetation in permanent plots with moderate (7-13 ka ha(-1) year 1) and lower bulk N deposition (4-6 kg ha(-1) year 1) in southern Sweden during 1982-1998. We examined whether trends differed between growth forms (vascular plants and bryophytes) and vegetation types (three types of coniferous forest, deciduous forest, and bog). Trends of site-standardized cover and richness varied among growth forms, vegetation types, and deposition regions. Cover in spruce forests decreased at the same rate with both moderate and low deposition. In pine forests cover decreased faster with moderate deposition and in bogs cover decreased faster with low deposition. Cover of bryophytes in spruce forests increased at the same rate with both moderate and low deposition. In pine forests cover decreased faster with moderate deposition and in bogs and deciduous forests there was a strong non-linear increase with moderate deposition. The trend of number of vascular plants was constant with moderate and decreased with low deposition. We found no trend in the number of bryophyte species. We propose that the decrease of cover and number with low deposition was related to normal ecosystem development (increased shading), suggesting that N deposition maintained or increased the competitiveness of some species in the moderate-deposition region. Deposition had no consistent negative effect on vegetation suggesting that it is less important than normal successional processes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to estimate atmospheric metal deposition in Southern Europe since the beginning of the Industrial Period (similar to 1850 AD), concentration profiles of Pb, Zn and Cu were determined in four Pb-210-dated peat cores from ombrotrophic bogs in Serra do Xistral (Galicia, NW Iberian Peninsula). Maximum metal concentrations varied by a factor of 1.8 for Pb and Zn (70 to 128 mu g g(-1) and 128 to 231 mu g g(-1), respectively) and 3.5 for Cu (11 to 37 mu g g(-1)). The cumulative metal inventories of each core varied by a factor of 3 for all analysed metals (132 to 329 mu g cm(-2) for Pb, 198 to 625 mu g cm(-2) for Zn and 22 to 69 mu g cm(-2) for Cu), suggesting differences in net accumulation rates among peatlands. Although results suggest that mean deposition rates vary within the studied area, the enhanced Pb-210 accumulation and the interpretation of the inventory ratios (Pb-210/Pb, Zn/Pb and Cu/Pb) in two bogs indicated that either a record perturbation or post-depositional redistribution effects must be considered. After correction, Pb, Zn and Cu profiles showed increasing concentrations and atmospheric fluxes since the mid-XXth century to maximum values in the second half of the XXth century. For Pb, maximum fluxes were observed in 1955-1962 and ranged from 16 to 22 mg m(-2) yr(-1) (mean of 18 1 mg m(-2) yr(-1)), two orders of magnitude higher than in the pre-industrial period. Peaks in Pb fluxes in Serra do Xistral before the period of maximum consumption of leaded petrol in Europe (1970s-1980s) suggest the dominance of local pollutant sources in the area (i.e. coal mining and burning). More recent peaks were observed for Zn and Cu, with fluxes ranging from 32 to 52 mg m(-2) yr(-1) in 1989-1996, and from 4 to 9 mg m(-2) yr(-1) in 1994-2001, respectively. Our results underline the importance of multi-core studies to assess both the integrity and reliability of peat records, and the degree of homogeneity in bog accumulation. We show the usefulness of using the excess Pb-210 inventory to distinguish between differential metal deposition, accumulation or anomalous peat records. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The regenerative abilities, establishment rates, and responses of establishment to nitrogen and phosphorus gradients differ appreciably when compared experimentally among five species of peatland mosses.  Aulacomnium palustre exhibited the highest regenerative ability and continued to exhibit high presence throughout the experiment due to continuous development of propagules and wide tolerance range to nutrients.  Drepanocladus aduncus established relatively quickly but declined in response to increases in other species.  Sphagnum angustifolium and Polytrichum strictum exhibited low establishment rates but increased in frequency throughout the experiment.  Sphagnum magellanicum regenerated poorly.  Nitrogen inputs had greater effects than did phosphorus and strongly inhibited regeneration and establishment of all species except A. palustre.  Phosphorus inputs had positive effects on D. aduncus and S. angustifolium but no effects on A. palustre and P. strictum.  The different abilities to utilize nutrient resources over a temporal scale may help determine the mature vegetation patterns in peatlands.  Nutrient gradients, especially nitrogen, during the establishment phase of these mosses may be a critical attribute in determining the distribution of these and other peatland species.

AB Peatland vegetation is composed mostly of mosses, graminoids and ericoid shrubs, and these have a distinct impact on peat biogeochemistry. We studied variation in soil microbial communities related to natural peatland microhabitats dominated by Sphagnum, cotton-grass and blueberry. We hypothesized that such microhabitats will be occupied by structurally and functionally different microbial communities, which will vary further during the vegetation season due to changes in temperature and photosynthetic activity of plant dominants. This was addressed using amplicon-based sequencing of prokaryotic and fungal rDNA and qPCR with respect to methane-cycling communities. Fungal communities were highly microhabitat-specific, while prokaryotic communities were additionally directed by soil pH and total N content. Seasonal alternations in microbial community composition were less important; however, they influenced the abundance of methane-cycling communities. Cotton-grass and blueberry bacterial communities contained relatively more alpha-Proteobacteria but less Chloroflexi, Fibrobacteres, Firmicutes, NC10, OD1 and Spirochaetes than in Sphagnum. Methanogens, syntrophic and anaerobic bacteria (i.e. Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, Opitutae, Chloroflexi and Syntrophorhabdaceae) were suppressed in blueberry indicating greater aeration that enhanced abundance of fungi (mainly Archaeorhizomycetes) and resulted in the highest fungi-to-bacteria ratio. Thus, microhabitats dominated by different vascular plants are inhabited by unique microbial communities, contributing greatly to spatial functional diversity within peatlands.

AB The present paper discusses water level fluctuations in different parts of boreal mire complexes (eleven localities), mainly aapa mire complexes, on the basis of measurements performed by means of shallow observation wells and a few deeper observation tubes (piezometers) in the coastal half of the southern aapa mire zone in Finland. The sites represented intact vegetation from 12 different habitat types (communities), which were divided a priori into habitats with a stable surface moisture status (stable habitats) and into habitats with an unstable surface moisture status (unstable habitats). In stable habitats water level fluctuations took place according to the acrotelm-catotelm model, but the unstable habitats clearly deviated from the general pattern: water level fluctuations in them were not at all concentrated to the surficial, porous peat layer. Direct gradient analysis was used for arranging the communities along the water level fluctuation gradient. Variability of the water table, using 80% amplitude of water table residence, was used for the arrangement. The gradient was split into three groups: (1) habitats with a slightly fluctuating water table, (2) habitats with a considerably fluctuating water table and (3) habitats with an extremely fluctuating water table. The last group nearly corresponded to aro wetlands, and represented a very special habitat type. Indirect gradient analysis (NMDS ordination) also revealed the water level fluctuation gradient along with the gradient of traditional water level categories. According to the results of direct and indirect gradient analysis, the water level fluctuation seems to be an independent and important vegetation gradient. In peatlands, it occurs alongside with the traditional gradient of water level categories reflecting the mean water table. The responses of species to the range of water level fluctuations seem to reflect their tolerance to disturbances and evidently to seasonal drought. Most Sphagnum species are absent or in poor condition in habitats with extremely fluctuating water table. Vascular plant species that experienced most extreme water level fluctuations (Carex nigra, Juncus filiformis) have earlier been regarded as disturbance indicators. In addition, the difference between the piezometric water level and simultaneously measured water table depth reached the highest values within the habitats of those species (i.e., within Polytrichum commune aro wetlands) showing the downward direction of water movement in sandy mineral soil.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key component of the carbon cycle and has significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems and potable water treatment. Upward trends in river and lacaustrine DOC concentrations have been observed and a number of key drivers have been proposed. Here, we present DOC concentration data from plot scale pore waters at one site and surface water from artificial drains sampled within a national survey which demonstrate a significant correlation between peatland vegetation type and DOC concentration. Calluna dominance was associated with the highest DOC concentration, Molinia and Sphagnum dominance with lower concentrations, and sedge dominance with intermediate concentrations. Water sampled from drains dominated by Calluna had greater DOC concentrations than water sampled from pore waters in plots dominated by Calluna. In contrast DOC concentrations from plots dominated by sedges were greater than those sampled from drains dominated by sedges. We discuss these findings in relation to plant functional traits and their influence on the physical and biotic conditions that regulate DOC concentrations. Given the known effects of management activities and climate change on peatland vegetation composition there is potential to manage plant community composition to ameliorate the observed rising DOC concentration.

AB The global increase in surface air temperature has produced an overall lengthening of the growing season by 3-5 days/decade in the Northern Hemisphere during the last 30 years. The direct impact of a longer growing season has not been well documented for Sphagnum moss communities in the Arctic. We hypothesized that an increase in the growing season length may be detrimental to Sphagnum growth as a result of photoinhibition caused by the plants emerging from snow near the seasonal peak of solar irradiance. We conducted an experiment from 1999 to 2002, lengthening the growing season in arctic Alaska, to determine the effects that this simulation of climate change had on the growth of hollows dominated by Sphagnum angustifolium. The lengthened growing season was associated with a decrease in annual moss height increment of 78 and 69 % for 1999 and 2000, respectively. These growth reductions may be related to freeze/thaw episodes and prolonged periods of cold in those years. The growth of individuals exposed to snow removal was also reduced by high global radiation. Overall, snow removal did not significantly affect the seasonal dynamics of growth, but seasonal patterns of growth strongly differed among years. These differences in seasonal dynamics suggest that Sphagnum growth is driven by opportunistic responses to favorable conditions rather than ontogenetic drivers. In addition, we compared environmental variation and growth between control and snow removal plots. Growth of Sphagnum in both treatments was stimulated by warmer soil temperatures and drier conditions. With earlier snowmelt as a result of warmer temperatures, it is likely that S. angustifolium will be subjected to higher levels of radiation and possibly greater photoinhibition which may lead to lower growth rates and significant implications for moss production in tussock tundra.

AB As ecosystem engineers, Sphagnum mosses control their surroundings through water retention, acidification and peat accumulation. Because water retention avoids desiccation, sphagna are generally intolerant to drought; however, the literature on Sphagnum desiccation tolerance (DT) provides puzzling results, indicating the inducible nature of their DT. To test this, various Sphagnum species and other mesic bryophytes were hardened to drought by (i) slow drying; (ii) ABA application and (iii) chilling or frost. DT tolerance was assessed as recovery of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters after severe desiccation. We monitored the seasonal course of DT in bog bryophytes. Under laboratory conditions, following initial de-hardening, untreated Sphagnum shoots lacked DT; however, DT was induced by all hardening treatments except chilling, notably by slow drying, and in Sphagnum species of the section Cuspidata. In the field, sphagna in hollows and lawns developed DT several times during the growing season, responding to reduced precipitation and a lowered water table. Hummock and aquatic species developed DT only in late autumn, probably as a response to frost. Sphagnum protonemata failed to develop DT; hence, desiccation may limit Sphagnum establishment in drier habitats with suitable substrate chemistry. Desiccation avoiders among sphagna form compact hummocks or live submerged; thus, they do not develop DT in the field, lacking the initial desiccation experience, which is frequent in hollow and lawn habitats. We confirmed the morpho-physiological trade-off: in contrast to typical hollow sphagna, hummock species invest more resources in water retention (desiccation avoidance), while they have a lower ability to develop physiological DT.

AB Palsa peatlands are a significant carbon pool in the global carbon cycle and are projected to change by global warming due to accelerated permafrost thaw. Our aim was to use stable carbon isotopes as indicators of palsa degradation. Depth profiles of stable carbon isotopes generally reflect organic matter dynamics in soils with an increase of delta C-13 values during aerobic decomposition and stable or decreasing delta C-13 values with depth during anaerobic decomposition. Stable carbon isotope depth profiles of undisturbed and degraded sites of hummocks as well as hollows at three palsa peatlands in northern Sweden were used to investigate the degradation processes. The depth patterns of stable isotopes clearly differ between intact and degraded hummocks at all sites. Erosion and cryoturbation at the degraded sites significantly changes the stable carbon isotope depth profiles. At the intact hummocks the uplifting of peat material by permafrost is indicated by a turning in the delta C-13 depth trend, and this assessment is supported by a change in the C / N ratios. For hollows isotope patterns were less clear, but some hollows and degraded hollows in the palsa peatlands show differences in their stable carbon isotope depth profiles indicating enhanced degradation rates. We conclude that the degradation of palsa peatlands by accelerated permafrost thawing can be identified with stable carbon isotope depth profiles. At intact hummocks delta C-13 depth patterns display the uplifting of peat material by a change in peat decomposition processes.

AB Large areas of peatlands have worldwide been drained to facilitate agriculture, which has adverse effects on the environment and the global climate. Agriculture on rewetted peatlands (paludiculture) provides a sustainable alternative to drainage-based agriculture. One form of paludiculture is the cultivation of Sphagnum moss, which can be used as a raw material for horticultural growing media. Under natural conditions, most Sphagnum mosses eligible for paludiculture typically predominate only in nutrient-poor wetland habitats. It is unknown, however, how the prevailing high nutrient levels in rewetted agricultural peatlands interfere with optimal Sphagnum production.
   We therefore studied the effect of enriched nutrient conditions remaining even after top soil removal and further caused by external supply of nutrient-rich irrigation water and (generally) high inputs of atmospheric nitrogen (N) to habitat biogeochemistry, biomass production and nutrient stoichiometry of introduced Sphagnum palustre and S. papillosum in a rewetted peatland, which was formerly in intensive agricultural use.
   Airborne N was responsible for the major supply of N. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were mainly supplied by irrigation water. The prevailing high nutrient levels (P and K) are a result of nutrient-rich irrigation water from the surroundings. Peat porewater (10 cm below peatmoss surface) CO2 concentrations were high, bicarbonate concentrations low, and the pH was around 4.2.
   Provided that moisture supply is sufficient and dominance of fast-growing, larger graminoids suppressed (in order to avoid outshading of Sphagnum mosses), strikingly very high biomass yields of 6.7 and 6.5 t DW ha(-1) yr(-1) (S, palustre and S. papillosum [including S. fallax biomass], respectively) were obtained despite high N supply and biomass N concentrations. Despite high P and K supply and uptake, N:P and N:K ratios in the Sphagnum capitula were still low. Sphagnum mosses achieved high nutrient sequestration rates of 34 kg N, 17 kg K and 4 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) from May 2013 to May 2014, which shows that the site acted as an active nutrient sink. Nutrient management still needs further improvement to reduce the competitive advantage of fast growing peatmoss species (cf. S. fallax) at the expense of slower growing but preferred peatmosses as horticultural substrate (S. palustre and S. papillosum) to optimize the quality of biomass yields.
   In conclusion, Sphagnum farming is well able to thrive under high N input provided that there is a simultaneous high input of P and K from irrigation water, which facilitates high production rates. Due to the lack of suitable, nutrient poor sites, it seems to be useful to remove the topsoil (mainly P removal) prior to start growing Sphagnum mosses. In addition, bicarbonate concentrations have to stay sufficientlylow to ensure a low pH, CO2 supply from the peat soil should be sufficiently high to prevent C limitation, and graminoids should be mown regularly.

AB Analyses of plant macrofossils, testate amoebae and humification have been carried out on a 2800-year core from Tore Hill Moss, a raised bog in the Strathspey region of Scotland. All three analyses were carried out at the same 4cm intervals allowing exact correlation, and the core was dated by nine Accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates and the Glen Garry tephra layer. The results have been combined and compared to present a bog surface wetness (BSW) record within which the limitations of each proxy method can be assessed and this has highlighted the advantages of a combined rather than a single proxy approach. Significant wet shifts are recorded at ca cal. 560 BC, 60 BC, AD 430, AD 570, AD 700, AD 1090 and AD 1640. Significant shifts to drier periods are also suggested ca cal. AD 220, AD 500 and AD 820. Some of the recorded shifts and phases are related to phases of wetter and drier climate such as the Sub-boreal/Sub-atlantic transition, the Dark Age deterioration and the Romano-British Warm Period. The Dark Ages are notable as a period of rapid peat accumulation and frequent water table fluctuations. Time-series analysis revealed a significant wet-shift cycle of 560 years from the testate amoebae data. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are closely related to organic matter processes such as decomposition, humification, and stabilization of organic matter in soils. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) have an equal response to these processes. We analyzed DOC and DON concentrations of topsoil, groundwater, and surface water of six differently used sites characterized by differences in peat degradation. Carbon (C-13, C-14) and nitrogen (N-15) isotopes of DOM were related to a humification index in order to detect differences between DOC and DON at different stages of humification. The results show that intact peatlands had higher DOC concentrations than degraded peatlands. Clearly, DOC concentration depends on soil organic carbon content and therefore on the degree of peat degradation. However, intact and degraded peatlands showed similar DON and inorganic N concentrations suggesting that DON release is dependent on soil inorganic N rather than the organic N pool. Moreover, a high degree of peat degradation resulted in lower DOC/DON ratios than the C/N ratio of the solid phase indicating a preferential release of DON from soil organic matter. Further, delta(13)C ratios and the radiocarbon age of DOM increase with peat degradation and humification indicating a high C turnover, an increased microbial modification and age of DOC. On the other hand delta(15)N ratios decrease, probably as a result of N fertilization. The promoting effect of inorganic N on DON release and a high humification of DOM at sites treated with inorganic N fertilizers suggest that N fertilization promotes a release of amino acids depleted in N-15 and subsequent condensation with carbohydrates to humic substances.

TI The development of a depth control system for a peat milling machine,
   part I: sensor development
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A closed-loop control system to alleviate the problems of variation in the layer thickness of a milled peat crop (crop depth) has been developed for a peat milling machine (miller). The main enabling technology behind the system, an electromechanical sensor developed to give real-time measurement of crop depth, is designed to act as the feedback element in the control system. The sensor is an accurate predictor of the average crop depth across the miller's 6.5 m width (co-efficient of determination, R-2 of 0.75). The miller, the bog and automatic control system were modelled, and experiments were carried out to establish a topographic model of the bog surface, and an oscillator was specially designed and developed to establish dynamic properties of the bog, for the model. The mean linear spring and damper values thereby measured are 117 kN m(-1) and 1036 Ns m(-1), respectively, for the oscillator. The sensor and model, both represent significant advances in real-time measurement for peat production and in the analysis of the interaction between the bog and the machine.

AB The aim of the work was to assess the progress of regeneration in the Landemarais peatland (Brittany, France), 8 years after the restoration of hydrological conditions. Feat C/N ratio ranged from 36 in the surface layers to 16 at 160 cm depth. The distribution of microbial activity with depth showed a decreasing CO2 and increasing CH4 productions, from the surface to 160 cm depth. Values for CO2 ranged from 26 +/- 2 to 185 +/- 34 mug C.g(-1) dry peat.d(-1) For CH4, values increased from 0 to 4 +/- 2 mug C.g(-1).d(-1) No significant denitrification was detected during the experiment. Microbial biomass C and N ranged from 1.7 +/- 0.1 to 4.2 +/- 0.3 mg C.g(-1) and from 352 +/- 38 mug N.g(-1) to 276 +/- 35 mug N.g(-1) respectively. The microbial activity profile analysis showed: (i) a restoration process but a quantitative C balance always favourable to a 'source' functioning; (ii) an interface at 75 cm depth which could correspond to the average depth of the water level before the restoration of hydrological conditions. The shift between microbial and vegetation community (recolonisation of turfigenous plants) responses could inform us on the speed of recovery of peat accumulation and give information about time resilience, i.e. the capacity of the system to accumulate peat.

AB Northern peatlands contain a large terrestrial carbon pool that plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle. A considerable fraction of this carbon pool is currently in permafrost and is biogeochemically relatively inert; this will change with increasing soil temperatures as a result of climate warming in the 21st century. We use a geospatially explicit representation of peat areas and peat depth from a recently-compiled database and a geothermal model to estimate northern North America soil temperature responses to predicted changes in air temperature. We find that, despite a widespread decline in the areas classified as permafrost, soil temperatures in peatlands respond more slowly to increases in air temperature owing to the insulating properties of peat. We estimate that an additional 670 km(3) of peat soils in North America, containing similar to 33 Pg C, could be seasonally thawed by the end of the century, representing similar to 20% of the total peat volume in Alaska and Canada. Warming conditions result in a lengthening of the soil thaw period by similar to 40 days, averaged over the model domain. These changes have potentially important implications for the carbon balance of peat soils.

AB The paper presents a new algorithm for finding the best-fit age-depth model of a peat profile dated with C-14. This algorithm of free-shape modelling is useful when the age-depth curve is wiggly and difficult to approximate by a simple mathematical function. The performance of the free-shape algorithm is illustrated with the example of the MA2 peat profile from Mauntschas mire, using 29 radiocarbon dates spanning the last 1300a, and where the age-depth Curve revealed a relatively complicated shape.
   The best-fit age-depth model searched for is a Curve maximising the 'Fit quality', defined as a combination of fit of C-14 dates to the radiocarbon calibration Curve, general smoothness of the age-depth line, and similarity of relative changes in the modelled sediment accumulation rates to those Suggested by independent data. The algorithm of free-shape age-depth modelling searched for a reasonable equilibrium or compromise between the conditions above. Uncertainty of the free-shape model was assessed with a Monte Carlo Markov chain built from large number of age-depth lines accepted with probabilities dependent on the 'fit quality' defined as above.
   Parallel fluctuations in concentrations of most pollen taxa in MA2 strongly Suggest a complicated shape of the age-depth curve, which is Supported in the upper part of the profile by the record of spheroidal carbonaceous particles, and in some levels also by the C-14 dates. A modification of total pollen concentrations was therefore used as a quantitative indicator of relative changes of the peat accumulation rate. The use of pollen concentrations improved the fit of the C-14 dates in several cases.
   Application of the final age-depth model to the pollen data resulted in a diagram of pollen accumulation which allows interpretation in ecological terms, whereas age-depth models that did not use pollen concentrations led to problematic and Confusing results. The obtained age-depth model is therefore accepted as a good approximation of the actual conditions. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Burning for habitat management is globally widespread. Burning over carbon-rich soils is a global environmental concern due to the potential contribution to climate change. In the UK upland heath and blanket bog, so-called 'moorland', often overlies carbon-rich soils, and has internationally important conservation value, but is burned as management for gamebird shooting and to a lesser extent for livestock grazing. There is little detailed information on the spatial extent or temporal trends in burning across the UK. This hinders formulation of policies for sustainable management, given that the practice is potentially detrimental for soil carbon storage, water quality and habitat condition. Using remotely sensed data, we mapped burning for gamebird management across c45 000 km(2) of the UK. Burning occurred across 8551 1-km squares, a third of the burned squares in Scotland and England were on peat >= 0.5 m in depth, and the proportion of moorland burned within squares peaked at peat depths of 1-2 m. Burning was detected within 55% of Special Areas of Conservation and 63% of Special Protection Areas that were assessed, and the proportion of moorland burned was significantly higher inside sites than on comparable squares outside protected areas. The annual numbers Of burns increased from 2001 to 2011 irrespective of peat depth. The spatial overlap of burning with peat and protected areas and the increasing number of burns require urgent attention, for the development of policies for sustainable management and reversal of damage to ecosystem services in the UK uplands.

AB Root production was measured with the ingrowth bag method on two pristine and three drained mire sites of different fertility in southern Finland during 1993-1995. The sites were selected among those where root production had also been measured with other methods. Root biomass on the drained sites started to increase clearly only during the second growing season, whereas on the pristine sites the ingrowth of roots began during the first, summer after the installation of the bags in spring. This suggested a slower ingrowth rate of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and dwarf shrub roots than of herbs and Cyperaceous species, which were more dominant on the pristine sites. The ingrowth bag method gave results comparable to the sequential coring method for the fine-root production (diameter < 2 mm) on the drained sites within 2-3 yrs after installation of the bags, whereas on the pristine site the estimate for total root production (diameter less than or equal to 10 mm) was significantly lower than that obtained with the C-14 turnover method.

AB Carbon dynamics of temperate peat swamps are a largely understudied component of wetland carbon cycling. Under a changing climate, hydrometeorological conditions may change, and understanding how peat swamps may be impacted is important. We investigated the importance of hydrogeomorphic setting on controlling soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from a temperate peat swamp in southern Ontario, Canada over a 3-year period. We chose three different hydrogeomorphic settings: (a) a site with strong wetland-stream interactions (i.e., an unconfined stream channel; unconfined), (b) a site with limited wetland-stream interactions (confined), and (c) an interior site (no wetland-stream interaction). The differing hydrogeomorphic conditions between the sites resulted in differences in carbon fluxes. The unconfined site maintained a higher water table across all three study years, providing conditions that are not favourable to CO2 production. The confined and interior sites sustained a much lower water table, with conditions more conducive to CO2 efflux. The unconfined site also had the highest CH4 emissions due to the increased anoxic conditions favourable for CH4 production as a result of the higher water table position. Hydrogeomorphic setting was found to be important for understanding within site variation, suggesting the sites may respond differently to longer-term shifts in environmental conditions. This may change relationships between sites if the responses are strong enough to significantly alter carbon fluxes, decomposition, and potential peat accumulation rates. It is important to understand the locally specific responses to environmental conditions within peat swamp ecosystems, in order to make future predictions about whole ecosystem function under changing conditions.

AB In this paper, CH4 flux was measured from Nov. 2002 to Oct. 2005, to estimate CH4 emissions in winter and during freeze-thaw period, and interannual variation in CH4 emissions in freshwater marsh in northeast China. The results showed that there was an obvious CH4 emission (0.1-2.3 mg m(-2) h(-1)) in the freshwater marsh in winter. Flux of CH4 in winter (November to March the next year) was about 3.8%, 5.5%, and 2.2% of the whole year in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Emission of CH4 significantly increased during the freeze-thaw period (April-June), and was about 30.8%, 20.9%, and 20.6% of the whole year in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Standing water depth greatly governed interannual variation of CH4 emissions from marshes during the thaw-freeze period. Interannual variation of CH4 emissions was significant during the growing season (p < 0.05). Standing water depth during April to June was a primary factor, which affected the interannual variation of CH4 flux during the growing season. Precipitation during the preceding non-growing season affected CH4 emission indirectly via standing water depth. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a whole-plant concept for a genus of voltzialean conifers on the basis of compression/impression and permineralized material from the Triassic of Antarctica. The reconstruction of the individual organs is based on a combination of organic connections, structural correspondences, similarities in cuticles and epidermal morphologies, co-occurrence data, and ex situ palynology. The affiliated genera of organs include trunks, branches, and roots (Notophytum); strap-shaped leaves with parallel venation (Heidiphyllum compressions and permineralized Notophytum leaves); seed cones (Telemachus and Parasciadopitys); pollen cones (Switzianthus); and bisaccate pollen of Alisporites type. Structural similarities lead us to suggest that Parasciadopitys is the permineralized state of a Telemachus cone and should be treated as a junior synonym. Biotic interactions involving the reconstructed conifer genus include plant-insect interactions (oviposition by Odonata) and not less than five different types of plant-fungal interactions, including two distinct endomycorrhizal associations, two probable seed parasites, and epiphyllous fungi. A representative whole plant is reconstructed as a 10-15-m-tall, seasonally deciduous forest tree with a vertical, narrow-conical crown shape. We interpret these Telemachus trees as the dominant components of peat-forming conifer swamps, forest bogs, and immature bottomland vegetation in the Triassic high-latitude river basins of southern Gondwana. In architecture, growth habit, and many ecological characteristics, the Telemachus conifers appear to be comparable to extant larch (Larix). Owing to the large amount and often exquisite preservation of the material, this conceptual whole-plant genus represents one of the most completely reconstructed ancient conifer taxa to date.

AB Drained and cultivated fen peats represent some of the world's most productive soils, however, they are susceptible to degradation and typically exhibit high rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. We hypothesised that GHG losses from these soils could be reduced by manipulating water table depth, tillage regime, crop residue application or horticultural fleece cover. Using intact soil columns from a horticultural peatland, emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 were monitored over a six-month period, using a closed-chamber method. Concurrent measurements of soil properties allowed identification of the key controls on GHG emissions. Raising the water table to the soil surface provided the strongest reduction in global warming potential (GWP(100); 25 +/- 6 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), compared to a free-draining control (80 +/- 1 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), but this effect was partially negated by an emission pulse when the water table was subsequently lowered. The highest emissions occurred when the water table was maintained 15 cm below the surface (168 +/- 11 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), as this stimulated N2O loss. Placement of horticultural fleece over the soil surface during spring had no significant effect on GWP100, but prolonged fleece application exacerbated GHG emissions. Leaving lettuce crop residues on the surface increased soil GWP(100) (105 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)) in comparison to when residues were incorporated into the soil (85 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), however, there was no evidence that this promoted positive priming of native soil organic matter (SOM). For maximum abatement potential, mitigation measures should be applied during the growing season, when GHG emissions are greatest. Our results also suggest that introduction of zero or minimum-till practices may not reduce GHG emissions. Maintaining a high water table was the only option that reliably reduced GHG emissions, however, this option is impractical to implement within current horticultural systems. We conclude that alternative strategies or a major change in land use (e.g., conversion from horticulture/arable to wetland) should be explored as a means of preserving these soils for future generations.

AB In this study, we explore how Sphagnum mosses and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris, interact on different spatial and temporal scales in a boreal bog ecosystem. We were particularly interested in relationships between the occurrence of Sphagnum-dominated habitats and the occurrence of Scots pines of different age and size.
   Juvenile and adult pines occurred in different habitats. While juveniles mainly occurred in Sphagnum-dominated habitats, predominantly with Sphagnum rubellum, adult pines were found in habitats dominated by lichens, or with a sparse vegetation cover. Examination of surface peat cores sampled close to adult pines revealed that almost all pines (97%) had established in a Sphagnum-dominated environment and that the habitat had changed since pine establishment. Scots pine is thus capable of changing and exterminating the Sphagnum-dominated environment preferred for germination and establishment. Pines impede Sphagnum growth and peat accumulation significantly once they have reached a stem diameter of approximately 20 mm. It takes from 30 to 90 yr for a pine to reach that size.
   Our results show the importance of interactions between Scots pine and Sphagnum mosses in bog ecosystems. We conclude that interactions between trees and Sphagnum mosses are important driving forces behind the vegetation change that has characterised boreal bogs during the Holocene.

AB Drained peat soils are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. Rewetting these soils is considered an important climate change mitigation tool to reduce emissions and create suitable conditions for carbon sequestration. Long-term monitoring is essential to capture interannual variations in GHG emissions and associated environmental variables and to reduce the uncertainty linked with GHG emission factor calculations. In this study, we present GHG balances: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) calculated for a 5-year period at a rewetted industrial cutaway peatland in Ireland (rewetted 7years prior to the start of the study); and compare the results with an adjacent drained area (2-year data set), and with ten long-term data sets from intact (i.e. undrained) peatlands in temperate and boreal regions. In the rewetted site, CO2 exchange (or net ecosystem exchange (NEE)) was strongly influenced by ecosystem respiration (R-eco) rather than gross primary production (GPP). CH4 emissions were related to soil temperature and either water table level or plant biomass. N2O emissions were not detected in either drained or rewetted sites. Rewetting reduced CO2 emissions in unvegetated areas by approximately 50%. When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the emission factors (calculated as 5-year mean of annual balances) for the rewetted site were (+/- SD) -104 +/- 80g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CO2 sink) and 9 +/- 2g CH4-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CH4 source). Nearly a decade after rewetting, the GHG balance (100-year global warming potential) had reduced noticeably (i.e. less warming) in comparison with the drained site but was still higher than comparative intact sites. Our results indicate that rewetted sites may be more sensitive to interannual changes in weather conditions than their more resilient intact counterparts and may switch from an annual CO2 sink to a source if triggered by slightly drier conditions.

AB Studies were carried out to identify a method of constructing a peatland evaluation map based on forecasting data of land subsidence of arable peatland in northern Japan. Land subsidence in a district here has become a serious problem due to the increase in the area of upland fields converted from paddy fields. First, we estimated the present rate of land subsidence based on the measurement of land elevation and soil survey, and determined the degree of decomposition of peat in marshlands, windbreak forests and arable lands in the Ishikari peatland in northern Japan. Second, we evaluated the sustainability of arable peatland based on data of actual land subsidence and other parameters, and we compiled an evaluation map of Ishikari peatland using geographical information systems (GIS). Soil type, period of land development, present land use and thickness of top-dressed soil were selected as main factors for the evaluation, and scores of elements of each factor were determined. According to the total scores, sustainability of arable peatland was divided into 3 classes. A land evaluation map of Ishikari peatland in terms of land subsidence was compiled using these classes.

AB Flooding and land use changes can be a significant source of nutrients to wetlands and contribute to ecosystem changes at a community level. We studied changes in vegetation composition and peat properties in a New Zealand wetland incorporated into a flood control scheme. Lack of hydrological records pre-development of the flood control scheme allowed the opportunity to use nutrient and physical indicators developed for restiad vegetation groups, to identify if increased flooding was the primary cause for ecological succession. Vegetation changes along a 2.3-km transect were related to hydrological processes, peat characteristics and atmospheric ammonia inputs. Measurements for peat and vegetation composition were taken from 27 sites, whereas hydrological analysis incorporated seven automated water level sites and a historical investigation of 46years of river flood records. Ammonia deposition was higher on the farmland/wetland fringe (4.0kgNha1year1) but decreased to background levels (22.5kgNha1year1) 500m into the wetland. Classification and ordination of vegetation data with environmental variables identified six main groups along a gradient from low nutrients and stable water tables (farthest from the river) to high nutrients and a dynamic water table near the river. Invasion over 50years of the native scrub tree Leptospermum scoparium into restiad bog was linked to enhanced nutrient inputs and physical degradation from flooding, portrayed through levels higher than restiad indicator target ranges. This study shows that target ranges for vegetation indicators can be used as a tool to identify ecological succession and invasion. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The Vasi peatland complex is situated in the northeast of South Africa. It is an unprotected area surrounded by pine (Pinus sp.) and blue gum (Eucalyptus sp.) plantations. Little is known about the conditioning factors for the area's development and causes of degradation. In order to understand the ecohydrological system of this complex, water tables and ionic composition of surface water and groundwater, as well as natural isotopes of oxygen, hydrogen and carbon, were measured. Macrofossils and radiocarbon dating of the peat layer were used to describe the historical environmental conditions. We found that peat accumulation started during the Early Holocene and was initiated by terrestrialisation of inter-dune lakes. Our results also show that the Vasi peatland complex is primarily dependent on a perched water table due to the presence of iron-rich deposits close to the surface (i.e. KwaMbonambi Formation). The Vasi peatland basins appear to be hydrologically connected and some basins show indications of cascading through-flow systems, which means that the water flows from a higher basin to a lower one through the permeable parts of the sand dunes and peat layers. The stratigraphy indicates continuous peat accumulation, and thus that the water table was perennially high for thousands of years, despite evidence of the occasional natural occurrence of fires. We conclude that the most likely cause of the observed signs of degradation is land use change, i.e. the recent establishment of plantations, which affect the groundwater system.

AB In the future management and sustainable use of boreal forests, it is crucial to consider the rate and strength of tree responses to an elevated water table and the concurrent oxygen limitations, especially in peatlands. We examined the response dynamics of 7-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings to a 5-week waterlogging (WL) treatment during a growing season in a root lab (dasotron) experiment. WL took place after shoot elongation had ended but while growth of the trunk diameter was still in progress. Trunk sap flow and needle water potential started to decrease immediately after the onset of WL, while the first signs in needle gas exchange - seen as decreases in the potential efficiency of photosystem II, the rates of light-saturated net assimilation and transpiration, and increased needle respiration-were observed after 3 weeks of WL. New needles responded to WL more strongly than the old ones. Drainage with consequent re-oxygenation of the soil caused a further decrease in sap flow. We conclude that through negative feedback on transpiration and net photosynthesis, WL during the growing season is harmful for Scots pine, leading to potential growth losses or even dying of trees within a few weeks of WL.

AB The paper presents the results of comprehensive studies of the general technical properties and electronic spectra of the humus substances of the Boltnoe high-moor peat section with a thickness of 720 cm (southern taiga in Western Siberia). It was found that high-moor peats mainly exhibited low degrees of decomposition (on average, 10%) and humification (0.6). Considerable variations in the degree of humification (0.14-1.30) within the deposit were established; the extinction coefficients of the alkaline extracts of peat varied over wide ranges: E465 0.25-2.41 and E665 0.08-0.43. A crucial effect of the botanical composition of peat on the spectral coefficients was established. A decrease in the indicator significance of the extinction coefficients of the alkaline extracts of weakly decomposed peats for the reconstruction of the hydrothermal conditions of Western Siberian bogs was found.

AB Rotational vegetation burning in peatlands is undertaken predominantly to increase habitat suitability and food availability for red grouse Lagopus lagopus (Linnaeus). Red grouse shooting contributes to the upland economy and is seen as a traditional leisure activity. However, there is concern that burning can have detrimental effects on peatland terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. This study examined spatial and seasonal dynamics of stream physicochemistry and benthic macroinvertebrates from peatland sites that are managed via rotational vegetation burning and compared these with intact sites with no recent history of burning. Streams draining burned catchments were characterized by higher fine benthic particulate organic matter (FPOM), suspended sediment concentration (SSC), aluminium, iron and dissolved organic carbon than unburnt intact catchments. Anion concentrations were higher in intact catchments. There were significant differences in benthic macroinvertebrate richness, diversity and dominance, and community composition and functional feeding groups between burned and intact catchments, suggesting that land management had an effect on aquatic ecosystems. Higher SSC and FPOM in burned catchments were associated with lower abundance of some mayflies, stoneflies and caddis-flies and elevated abundance of some Diptera (Chironomidae and Simuliidae) larvae. Synthesis and applications. This study suggests that some aspects of peatland stream ecosystems are altered in catchments with rotational vegetation burning. Currently, there is much emphasis on the effects of rotational burning on peat carbon stores, but this study is the first to document the impacts on stream biota. Agencies with a remit covering upland freshwater ecosystem management might need to consider ways of reducing the extent of rotational vegetation burning to prevent effects on lotic ecosystems, and monitor whether macroinvertebrate assemblages subsequently shift back to a status similar to those in intact peatland streams. Fire occurs commonly on peatlands throughout the world, and our results suggest that trade-offs are needed to satisfy both economic and ecological facets of the combined socialecological systems in such areas, especially where fire is implemented as a management tool.

AB The article presents the results of a study concerning the elemental composition of the humic acids extracted from the peats of stratigraphic column in Mukhrino bog located in the Middle Taiga of Western Siberia. Description of the botanical composition and a degree of decomposition of the original peats are presented herein. The carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur in humic acids are recalculated with reference to the anhydrous and ashless substance. The common borders are presented, in which the mass fractions of carbon (50.30 - 59.30%), oxygen (29.58 - 38.10%), hydrogen (4.68 - 6.13%), nitrogen (2.69 - 5.95%), and sulfur (0.10 - 1.87%) change. The elemental analysis data of the humic acids were grouped according to the original peat's botanical composition, and the average mass fractions were found. The humic acids extracted from the sphagnum peats have the highest carbon content of about 58%, however, the species differences do not make a significant difference. The carbon mass fraction of scheuchzeria peat is lower and amounts to about 56%. Grass-hypnum sapropel - 54%. Sapropel - 52%. The atomic ratios H/C, (H/C)(cor). and O/C were calculated for the groups extracted on the basis of their botanical composition. The diagram of atomic ratios was constructed in coordinates (H/C)(cor). -O/C. Based on the diagram, five groups of the humic acids that differ in original peat depth were identified.

AB Chamber carbon flux measurements are routinely used to assess ecosystemcarbon sink/source dynamics. Often these point measurements enclose considerable vegetation biomass, with fluxes upscaled in space and time for each vegetation type. Here we assess the importance of including the volume of peatland dwarf shrub vegetation in chamber flux calculations and outline a simple but effective method of assessing plant volumes. We show that inclusion of plant volumes significantly affects fluxes and that this effect becomes greater as the proportion of chamber volume occupied by plants increases. Moreover, we demonstrate that, with an initial destructive laboratory assessment for each plant species and a little practice at volume estimation, plant volumes can be accurately assessed non-destructively in the field.

AB The Ural Mountains (the Urals) are a mountain range on the border between the continents of and . The Urals extend about 2500 km from north to south and run from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the steppe of northwestern Kazakhstan. In terms of mycorrhizal traits, the vegetation of the Urals has not been studied absolutely compared with the other mountain systems of Europe. Detailed research of vegetation at the Telpos-iz Ridge (Northern Urals, Russia) allowed us to analyze changes in mycorrhizal status (obligatory mycorrhizal, OM; facultative mycorrhizal, FM; non-mycorrhizal, NM) and type (arbuscular, AM; ectomycorrhiza, ECM; ericoid, ERM; ORM, orchid mycorrhiza; NM) both in the main vegetation types and the individual communities along the elevation and ecological gradients based on 165 releves. This is the first attempt to describe the mycorrhizal status of plant communities across different elevations and ecological conditions outside Europe and North America. OM species were most diverse in all vegetation types. Maximal share of NM species was found in the mires and may be explained by over logged and unfertile soils of these habitats. Arbuscular mycorrhizas dominated across all vegetation types except for mires, where specific ecological conditions result in the prevalence of ECM and NM species. We analyzed the mycorrhizal status and type of plant communities along the main ecological gradients and found a decisive role of elevation and soil nitrogen content. At the same time, it remains unclear which factor determines the distribution of ECM and AM communities which are most represented in the vegetation of the study area.

AB Vegetation removal with fire can alter the thermal regime of the land surface, leading to significant changes in biogeochemistry (e.g. carbon cycling) and soil hydrology. In the UK, large expanses of carbonrich upland environments are managed to encourage increased abundance of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) by rotational burning of shrub vegetation. To date, though, there has not been any consideration of whether prescribed vegetation burning on peatlands modifies the thermal regime of the soil mass in the years after fire. In this study thermal regime was monitored across 12 burned peatland soil plots over an 18-month period, with the aim of (i) quantifying thermal dynamics between burned plots of different ages (from <2 to 15 + years post burning), and (ii) developing statistical models to determine the magnitude of thermal change caused by vegetation management. Compared to plots burned 15 + years previously, plots recently burned (<2-4 years) showed higher mean, maximum and range of soil temperatures, and lower minima. Statistical models (generalised least square regression) were developed to predict daily mean and maximum soil temperature in plots burned 15+ years prior to the study. These models were then applied to predict temperatures of plots burned 2, 4 and 7 years previously, with significant deviations from predicted temperatures illustrating the magnitude of burn management effects. Temperatures measured in soil plots burned <2 years previously showed significant statistical disturbances from model predictions, reaching +6.2 degrees C for daily mean temperatures and +19.6 degrees C for daily maxima. Soil temperatures in plots burnt 7 years previously were most similar to plots burned.15 + years ago indicating the potential for soil temperatures to recover as vegetation regrows. Our findings that prescribed peatland vegetation burning alters soil thermal regime should provide an impetus for further research to understand the consequences of thermal regime change for carbon processing and release, and hydrological processes, in these peatlands.

AB Mapping the spatial and temporal changes of peatland in farming systems is crucial to the study of soil quality and productivity and the modeling of the global carbon cycle (in relation to climate change). This study compiles a contemporary map (2010) of peatland coverage (according to Kyoto protocol) across the cultivated wetlands of Denmark and compares this actual map to a historical 1975 peat coverage map using simple indicator kriging. For the contemporary peatland mapping, extensive soil sampling databases consisting of 42,568 points with 32,817 historical samples and 9,751 contemporary samples were used. These databases contain partly categorical information on parent material (organic [peat, gytje] and mineral [sand, silt and clay]) and partly continuous data (soil organic carbon, in %) reclassified into organic and mineral soils (using 12% soil organic carbon as a cutoff value). In the simple indicator kriging procedure, the values 0 and 1 were assigned to the stationary means of the indicator codes to represent two hypotheses, that is, mineral and organic (peat) soils, respectively. The collected and analyzed contemporary unbiased organic samples (measured on different rectangular grid scales of 250, 275, and 500 m) in addition to some transformed historical organic samples (according to certain decision rules) were used to estimate the recent areal coverage of peat (2010) that was equivalent to 70,176 ha, and this estimate corresponds to an indicator kriging probability of 0.35. Results revealed there has been a total areal coverage loss of 35% (37,786 ha) of the Danish organic cultivated wetlands during a period of 35 years (map 1975 had 107,962-ha coverage of peat). The peat depletion is related to peat mining and agricultural drainage/tillage activities, rather than natural geological processes.

AB Remote Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) lake sediment and peat records of mercury (Hg) deposition have shown a X3 to X5 Hg enrichment since pre-industrial times (<1880 AD), leading to the perception that global atmospheric Hg enrichment is moderate and uniform across the hemispheres. Anthropogenic Hg emissions in the NH are, however, approximately 4 times higher than those in the SH. Here, we reconstruct atmospheric Hg deposition in four remote SH peatlands and review sediment and peat Hg records from both hemispheres. We observe a X4 all-time enrichment in SH Hg deposition from pre-anthropogenic (<1450 AD) to the late 20th-century periods, which is lower than the large X16 all-time enrichment in NH Hg deposition. We attribute this difference to lower anthropogenic Hg emissions in the SH, and higher natural atmospheric SH Hg concentrations, supported by X2 higher natural background Hg accumulation in SH peat records. We suggest that the higher SH natural atmospheric Hg deposition reflects the SH land-ocean distribution, and is driven by important SH marine Hg emissions. Our findings indicate that atmospheric Hg background levels and anthropogenic enrichment in both hemispheres are different and should be taken into account in international Hg assessments and environmental policy.

AB UK peatlands are affected by severe gully erosion with consequent impacts on ecosystem services from these areas. Incision into the peat can damage the vegetation and hydrology and lead to increases in carbon loss and sediment transfer downstream. Gullies represent then a conduit for and a hotspot of carbon loss but the relatively high water tables of gullies have meant that they have been identified as areas with a high restoration potential because of easily restored peat-forming conditions. This study uses a series of gully sites, subject to different restoration interventions, to investigate differences in carbon pathways (DOC, CO2) and hydrology between restoration strategies and gully position. The results show that the position within the gully (interfluve, gully side, or gully floor) does not significantly affect water quality but that it plays a significant role in CO2 exchange. Gully floors are areas of high photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration, though net ecosystem exchange is not significantly different across the gully. While gully position plays a role in the cycling of some carbon species, this study highlights the importance of vegetation as a key control on carbon cycling.

AB Amendments to Articles 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol have meant that detection of vegetation change may now form an interracial part of national soil carbon stocks. In this study multispectral multi-platform satellite data was processed to detect change to the surface vegetation of four peatland sites and one heath in Ireland. Spectral and spatial thresholds were used on difference images between master and slave data in the extraction of temporally invariant targets for multi-platform cross calibration. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to evaluate any difference in the cumulative probability distributions of the master, slave and calibrated slave data as expressed by the D statistic, with values reduced by an average of 89.7% due to the cross calibration procedure. A change detection model was created which incorporated a spatial threshold of 9 pixels and a standard deviation (SD) spectral threshold. Kappa accuracy values for the five sites ranged from 80 to 97%, showing that 1.5 SD was the optimum spectral threshold for detecting vegetation change. Change detection results showed mean percentage change ranging from 2.11 to 3.28% of total area and cumulative change over the observed time period of between 15.24 and 49.27% of total area.

AB Potential benefits of peatland restoration by rewetting include carbon sequestration, restored biodiversity, and improved hydrological functions. There is great uncertainty about how catchment hydrological processes change after restoration, with a particular lack of well-documented catchment runoff data. This study compared five formerly Disturbed (now Restored) and two undisturbed peatlands. In total, 455 and 728 hydrological events were selected for the analysis, using a three-event selection technique. Mean event runoff coefficient (RC) values varied greatly between conditions and hydrological events. RC in Disturbed conditions was slightly higher than in undisturbed conditions, but RC in Restored conditions was higher than under other conditions. Mean transit time revealed that event rainfall water reached the outlet faster in Disturbed conditions. Mean event peak flow in Disturbed conditions was higher and peaked faster than under other conditions. However, the base flow showed no noticeable difference between treatments. Significantly higher watertable (WT) rise per rainfall input (0.36-0.85 cm/mm) was observed in Disturbed conditions, due to lower specific yield (Sy) values (0.13-0.24) than under Restored and undisturbed conditions (Sy 0.25-0.50). Shallow WT showed significant positive correlations with runoff and storage properties and was a key component of the runoff generation mechanisms in peatlands. Storage-related parameters (Sy, WT rise per rainfall input) and catchment response time parameters revealed disturbance-related hydrological changes in peatlands more clearly than other runoff parameters tested (e.g., RC). Overall, with restoration, WT and storage properties recovered to the levels at undisturbed sites but increased runoff was observed occasionally due to wetter antecedent moisture conditions.

AB Worldwide, fens and peat lakes that used to be peat-forming systems have become a significant source of C, N and P due to increased peat decomposition. To test the hypothesis that net nutrient mineralization rates may be uncoupled from decomposition rates, we investigated decomposition and net mineralization rates of nutrients in relation to sediment and pore water characteristics. We incubated 28 non-calcareous peat sediments and floating fen soils under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We also tried to find a simple indicator to estimate the potential nutrient mobilization rates from peat sediments to the water layer by studying their relation with sediment and pore water characteristics in 44 Dutch non-calcareous peat lakes and ditches.
   Decomposition rates were primarily determined by the organic matter content, and were higher under aerobic conditions. However, highly decomposed peat sediments with low C: P and C:N ratios still showed high net nutrient mineralization rates. At Fe:PO4 ratios below 1 mol mol(-1), PO4 mobilization from the sediment to the water layer was considerable and linearly related to the pore water PO4 concentration. At higher ratios, there was a strong linear correlation between the Fe:PO4 ratio and PO4 mobilization. Hence, measuring Fe and PO4 in anaerobic sediment pore water provides a powerful tool for a quick assessment of internal PO4 fluxes. Mobilization of mineral N was largely determined by diffusion. Total sediment Fe:S ratios gave an important indication of the amount of Fe that is available to immobilize PO4. Pore water Fe concentrations decreased at ratios <1 mol mol(-1), whereas pore water PO4 concentrations and PO4 mobilization to the water layer increased.
   As PO4 mobilization rates from the sediment to the water layer contribute to almost half of the total P load in Dutch peat lakes and fens, it is of pivotal importance to examine the magnitude of internal fluxes. Dredging of the nutrient-rich upper sediment layer will only be a useful restoration measure if both the influx of P-rich water and its internal mobilization from the newly exposed, potentially more reactive peat layer are sufficiently low.

AB Soil enzyme activities play a pivotal role in ecosystem processes, such as organic carbon decomposition or nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization. Thus, enzyme activities measurements can provide insights into the rates of ecosystem-level processes in peatlands. Hummock-hollow microtopography is a common feature in boreal peatlands, but its influence on soil enzyme activity is not well understood. We investigated the effects of hummock-hollow microtopography on activities of three soil hydrolases (beta-1,4-glucosidase (beta G), 4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), and acid phosphatase (AP)) and one oxidase (peroxidase (PER)), as well as environmental variables in a sedge-dominated peatland in Changbai Mountains, in northeast China. We found that soil enzyme activities had large microtopographical and seasonal heterogeneity. During the growing season, the activities of three soil hydrolases (beta G, NAG and AP) in hummocks were 6.6, 4.6 and 5.5 times higher than those in hollows, while the PER activity in hollows was 1.9 times higher than in hummocks. Soil enzyme activities in hummocks exhibited obvious seasonal variation, with the pG, beta P and PER presenting minimum values in summer and peak values in spring and autumn. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that soil enzyme activity had larger microtopographical heterogeneity than seasonal variations. Water table position explained most variation (74.1%) in soil enzyme activity, followed by soil temperature (5.5%) and pH (3.1%) based on ordination analysis using RDA. We conclude that hummock-hollow microtopography creates heterogeneity in hydrologic conditions, soil temperature and nutrients, and thus influences soil enzyme activity involved in carbon and nutrient cycling in sedge-dominated peatlands. This information stresses the importance of hummock-hollow microtopography in regulating carbon and nutrient cycling in northern peatlands.

AB A c. 5500 year record of peatland development and vegetation change was generated from a core recovered from an Agrostis magellanica peat bog on subantarctic Marion Island, using palynomorph, plant macrofossil, and tephra analyses. Two tephra horizons (both 17 cm thick) were identified and dated to ca. 2900 cal. BP and ca. 1700 cal. BP. Succession of the vegetation as a consequence of tephra deposition, particularly by the pioneer Azorella selago, appears to have been very slow, lasting as long as c. 700 yr. The slow pace of vegetation succession highlights the sensitivity of the indigenous Marion Island flora to environmental change, and the vulnerability to the spread of alien invasive species.

AB We made an experiment on a 30 cm. diameter core of Sphagnum-dominated vegetation and peat to estimate the parameters controlling methane oxidation during movement to the ambient air: 13 CH4 was added at the water table, and excess 13 CO2 appeared in the gas space above the core. At 20 degreesC in otherwise undisturbed conditions, similar to 22% of CH4 was oxidized to CO2 during passage up through the overlying 10-cm thick unsaturated peat and plants. We simulated the experiment, with seven parameters: transfer coefficients in water, in the gas phase, and through the container wall; the rate of CH4 and Of CO2 generation; and the two parameters of a hyperbolic relation between CH4 concentration and the rate of CH4 oxidation. We optimized these parameters to fit the experimental results, and then were able to generalize to any temperature (0 degrees -25 degreesC) and any depth (0-55 cm) of water table. Changing temperature has important effects on the proportion of CH4 oxidized.

AB In high-latitude regions, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions during the winter represent an important component of the annual ecosystem carbon budget; however, the mechanisms that control the winter CO2 emissions are currently not well understood. It has been suggested that substrate availability from soil labile carbon pools is a main driver of winter CO2 emissions. In ecosystems that are dominated by annual herbaceous plants, much of the biomass produced during the summer is likely to contribute to the soil labile carbon pool through litter fall and root senescence in the autumn. Thus, the summer carbon uptake in the ecosystem may have a significant influence on the subsequent winter CO2 emissions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a plot-scale shading experiment in a boreal peatland to reduce the gross primary production (GPP) during the growing season. At the growing season peak, vascular plant biomass in the shaded plots was half that in the control plots. During the subsequent winter, the mean CO2 emission rates were 21% lower in the shaded plots than in the control plots. In addition, long-term (2001-2012) eddy covariance data from the same site showed a strong correlation between the GPP (particularly the late summer and autumn GPP) and the subsequent winter net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). In contrast, abiotic factors during the winter could not explain the interannual variation in the cumulative winter NEE. Our study demonstrates the presence of a cross-seasonal link between the growing season biotic processes and winter CO2 emissions, which has important implications for predicting winter CO2 emission dynamics in response to future climate change.

AB Peatlands are important sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) that, in response to climate warming, are undergoing dynamic vegetation succession. Here we examined the hypothesis that the uptake of nutrients by different plant growth forms (PGFs) is one key mechanism driving changes in species abundance in peatlands. Along an altitude gradient representing a natural climate experiment, we compared the variability of the stable C isotope composition (delta C-13) and stable nitrogen (N) isotope composition (delta N-15) in current-year leaves of two major PGFs, i.e. ericoids and graminoids. The climate gradient was associated with a gradient of vascular plant cover, which was parallelled by different concentrations of organic and inorganic N as well as the fungal/bacterial ratio in peat. In both PGFs the C-13 natural abundance showed a marginal spatial decrease with altitude and a temporal decrease with progression of the growing season. Our data highlight a primary physical control of foliar delta C-13 signature, which is independent from the PGFs. Natural abundance of foliar N-15 did not show any seasonal pattern and only in the ericoids showed depletion at lower elevation. This decreasing delta N-15 pattern was primarily controlled by the higher relative availability of organic versus inorganic N and, only for the ericoids, by an increased proportion of fungi to bacteria in soil. Our space-for-time approach demonstrates that a change in abundance of PGFs is associated with a different strategy of nutrient acquisition (i.e. transfer via mycorrhizal symbiosis versus direct fine-root uptake), which could likely promote observed and predicted dwarf shrub expansion under climate change.

AB In order to document climate fluctuations during the late Holocene in Nunavik (in the Quebec Arctic), a 182 cm peat core extracted from a polygonal peatland in the Salluit region was subjected to macrofossil and pollen analysis. Peat accumulation began around 4500 cal. BP in the peatland and 2340 cal. BP in the core site following the formation of frost cracks and ice wedges. Four distinct Holocene climatic changes were identified. Between 1910 and 1100 cal. BP, the climate was clement (similar to today's climate), which favoured the growth of several species of Sphagnum (from poorly minerotrophic to ombrotrophic conditions). Colder and drier conditions starting around 1100 cal. BP are evidenced by the disappearance of Sphagnum and aeolian sedimentation. A short return to more clement conditions occurred around 870 cal. BP and lasted until 670 cal. BP. Subsequently, the climate once again became colder and drier, which induced significant aeolian activity. Late-Holocene local vegetation changes recorded in the peat core were probably induced by permafrost degradation and aggradation, associated with regional warming and a subsequent cooling trend.

It was established that shoot growth rates fluctuated with a period of around 30 days, that is, showed a circatrigintan rhythm. Such rhythms from mosses have not been previously reported. Correlation of growth rates with the percentage of the illuminated portion of the Moon was statistically significant (p<0.01) in both years. Shoot growth rates were reliably higher around the new Moon compared to the full Moon. This phenomenon may be due either to causality or to a pure coincidence of processes with similar rhythms.

AB Climate change is likely to significantly affect the hydrology, ecology, and ecosystem function of peatlands, with potentially important but unclear impacts on mercury mobility within and transport from peatlands. Using a full-factorial mesocosm approach, we investigated the potential impacts on mercury mobility of water table regime changes (high and low) and vegetation community shifts (sedge-dominated, Ericaceae-dominated, or unmanipulated control) in peat monoliths at the PEATcosm mesocosm facility in Houghton, Michigan. Lower and more variable water table regimes and the loss of Ericaceae shrubs act significantly and independently to increase both total Hg and methylmercury concentrations in peat pore water and in spring snowmelt runoff. These differences are related to enhanced peat decomposition and internal regeneration of electron acceptors which are more strongly related to water table regime than to plant community changes. Loss of Ericaceae shrubs and an increase in sedge cover may also affect Hg concentrations and mobility via oxygen shuttling and/or the provision of labile root exudates. Altered hydrological regimes and shifting vegetation communities, as a result of global climate change, are likely to enhance Hg transport from peatlands to downstream aquatic ecosystems.

AB We investigated total storage and landscape partitioning of soil organic carbon (SOC) in continuous permafrost terrain, central Canadian Arctic. The study is based on soil chemical analyses of pedons sampled to 1-m depth at 35 individual sites along three transects. Radiocarbon dating of cryoturbated soil pockets, basal peat and fossil wood shows that cryoturbation processes have been occurring since the Middle Holocene and that peat deposits started to accumulate in a forest-tundra environment where spruce was present (similar to 6000 cal yrs BP). Detailed partitioning of SOC into surface organic horizons, cryoturbated soil pockets and non-cryoturbated mineral soil horizons is calculated (with storage in active layer and permafrost calculated separately) and explored using principal component analysis. The detailed partitioning and mean storage of SOC in the landscape are estimated from transect vegetation inventories and a land cover classification based on a Landsat satellite image. Mean SOC storage in the 0-100-cm depth interval is 33.8 kg C m(-2), of which 11.8 kg C m(-2) is in permafrost. Fifty-six per cent of the total SOC mass is stored in peatlands (mainly bogs), but cryoturbated soil pockets in Turbic Cryosols also contribute significantly (17%). Elemental C/N ratios indicate that this cryoturbated soil organic matter (SOM) decomposes more slowly than SOM in surface O-horizons. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Recent research into the production of Sphagnum biomass in extracted peatlands, an alternative to ecological restoration as a post-industrial use of peatlands, has highlighted the need for an improved understanding of the ecohydrology of Sphagnum regenerating in these environments. Previous work suggested that limited connectivity between surficial layers and the underlying partially decomposed plant matter and peat would result in water stress and inhibited growth. This study links the soil water dynamics of regenerated layers ranging in age from 3 to 43 years and from 3 to 40 cm in thickness to the productivity of Sphagnum in order to determine the hydrological controls on productivity and the optimal range of water content for producing Sphagnum biomass. Productivity was never observed to be limited by insufficient supply of water, including during periods where water table was >40 cm below the surface and periods of 16 days without measured precipitation. While layers of different ages and thicknesses were able to sustain adequate water supply to remain productive under a range of conditions, the ability of layers to transmit water upwards differed greatly. Water content in the near-surface inhibited productivity during wetter periods, especially at newly regenerating sites where the layer was <5 cm thick. This has important implications for biomass production using the Sphagnum species studied here. Using a mixed linear modelling approach to isolate the effects of water content on variance in productivity from those of other measured variables, a volumetric water content of 0.10 is identified as optimal.

AB Peat cores from ombrotrophic bogs have been used as a valuable archive to study environmental change for over a century. Much of this focus on the peat record has been on biological proxies of environmental change, such as pollen and peat-forming macrofossils, but there is growing interest in the geochemical record to study environmental changes. Several studies of long-term peat records in Europe have reconstructed past changes in atmospheric lead pollution, for example, and the general cohesiveness of the results and their agreement with known historical trends in metal production exemplify the best potential of peat geochemistry as an environmental archive. Based on the success with lead, a current emphasis in peat reconstructions is to assess the record of past mercury deposition and results thus far show generally consistent trends, e.g., a pre-anthropogenic mercury accumulation rate of about 0.5-1.5 mu g Hg m(-2) year(-1). Despite this general consistency there is increasing concern that there may be diagenetic effects on the quantitative record of some metals, which can be inferred based on a strong relationship between mercury and other organically bound elements and proxies for peat decomposition (C/N ratio). However, it is possible that changes in decomposition and the alteration of some metal records could provide climatic information. A few recent studies show that closer examination of the geochemical matrix, in some cases along with biological proxies, can provide valuable information on landscape changes and climate; for example, partitioning metals into different weight fractions and source regions can be applied to climate studies. The best interpretations of the peat geochemical record in the context of environmental and climate change will likely come when geochemical and biological records are considered simultaneously.

AB Recent studies have shown the establishment of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) to be successful in small canopy gaps cut in drained spruce mire stands in northern Finland. The aim of this study was to quantify seedling height growth in gaps and compare it to that observed in other canopy cuttings and plantations. We sampled spruce crop seedlings (maximum density ca. 3000 ha(-1)) in the spring of 2013 in a field experiment in which canopy gaps of 10, 15 and 20 m in diameter had been cut in winter 2004. The total seedling height in 2013 and the length of annual shoots over the past five years (2012-2008) were recorded in the survey. Seedling height varied from 20 cm to 2.7 m, with an average of 65 cm. The average annual height growth was 7.1 cm. A mixed linear model analysis was carried out to investigate seedling height growth variation. Seedling height was linearly and positively related to growth. Height growth started to increase in the fifth growing season after cutting. Seedling height growth in the 20 m gap was slightly better than in the smaller ones. In the 15 m gap, both the centrally located seedlings and those located at the northern edge grew best. In the 20 m gap, southerly located seedlings grew more slowly than seedlings in all other locations. The average seedling height growth in this study was about 60% of that in peatland plantations, but comparable to that in mineral soil gaps, and 2-3 times higher than in uneven-age cut stands.

AB N-15-Labelled urea fertilizer was used to examine initial uptake patterns of nitrogen (N) into foliage of tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.), and movement of N from point of placement through live moss and organic soil on a drained minerotrophic peatland in central Alberta, Canada. The site was ditched in Fall 1987 and N-15-labelled urea fertilizer was applied on 1 June 1989. Tree foliage and soil samples were taken periodically during the 1989 growing season. A greater proportion of fertilizer N was retained (immobilized) in peat residue of surface soil layers (0-20 cm depth) and this did not change during the study period. However, mineral-N-15 concentration decreased from 76 to 19 mg N-15 kg(-1) between Week 2 and Week 13 following fertilizer application. Foliar %NDFF (the percentage of total N derived from fertilizer) and N-15 content (amount of N-15 per needle) increased rapidly for both species during the growing season. A higher proportion of fertilizer N taken up by trees was allocated to tissues of high metabolic activity, i.e. current needles. The foliar %NDFF was higher for black spruce compared with that of tamarack. This may be related to a greater size (amount of foliage and associated photosynthetic organelle) and strength (rate of biological activity) of the sink for N associated with black spruce relative to that of tamarack.

AB The impact of land use on the content of labile soil organic carbon (SOC) has been studied well. However, limited information is known about its effect on the recalcitrant SOC pool, which is a key proxy for long-term carbon sequestration. We investigated the impact of land use change on the distribution of labile and recalcitrant SOC fractions in soil profiles (0-30 cm) in the Jinchuan peatland, Northeast China, where native peatland (with peat soil) and forest (with mineral soil) are converted to paddy and cropland, respectively. Peat and mineral soil profile samples were collected from 10 sites in native and cultivated land. Total organic carbon (TOC) and KMnO4-oxidizable carbon (KOC) defined as the labile SOC fraction were measured in both peat and mineral soils. Fibre and lignin were also determined in peat samples. The mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) and black carbon were examined as two recalcitrant SOC fractions. In peat soil profiles, the TOC and KOC contents increased with the increasing depth across all land uses. The conversion of peatland to paddy field can affect TOC content at each peat soil depth. The KOC content was lower in cultivated soils, indicating that cultivation decreased KOC. The KOC decrease was smaller than the TOC decrease, indicating that some recalcitrant SOC fractions were decomposed because of land use change. Unlike peat soil profiles, the TOC and KOC contents decreased with depth in mineral soil profiles across all land uses. The TOC and KOC contents in surface soil decreased remarkably after cultivation to cropland but were not affected in deep soil. Interestingly, recalcitrant SOC fractions, such as MOC, increased in mineral soil profile after cultivation but showed no change in peat soil profile. This study suggests that conversion of peatland to paddy can release the recalcitrant SOC fraction. In addition, conversion of cultivated forest to cropland decreased the TOC content but prolonged the long-term storage of some recalcitrant SOC fractions, such as MOC. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Spatial patterning of ecosystems can be explained by several mechanisms. One approach to disentangling the influence of these mechanisms is to study a patterned ecosystem along a gradient of environmental conditions. This study focused on hummock-hollow patterning of peatlands. Previous models predicted that patterning in drainage-dominated peatlands is driven by a peat-accumulation mechanism, reflected by higher nutrient availability in hollows relative to hummocks. Alternatively, patterning in evapotranspiration (ET)-dominated peatlands may be driven by a nutrient-accumulation mechanism, reflected by reversed nutrient distribution, namely, higher nutrient availability in hummocks relative to hollows. Here, we tested these predictions by comparing nutrient distributions among patterned peatlands in maritime (Scotland), humid temperate (Sweden), and humid continental (Siberia) climates. The areas comprise a climatic gradient from very wet and drainage-dominated (Scotland) to less wet and ET-dominated (Siberia) peatlands. Nutrient distribution was quantified as resource contrast, a measure for hummock-hollow difference in nutrient availability. We tested the hypothesis that the climatic gradient shows a trend in the resource contrast; from negative (highest nutrient availability in hollows) in Scotland to positive (highest nutrient availability in hummocks) in Siberia. The resource contrasts as measured in vegetation indeed showed a trend along the climatic gradient: contrasts were negative to slightly positive in Scotland, positive in Sweden, and strongly positive in Siberia. This finding corroborates the main prediction of previous models. Our results, however, also provided indications for further model development. The low concentrations of nutrients in the water suggest that existing models could be improved by considering both the dissolved and adsorbed phase and explicit inclusion of both nutrient-uptake and nutrient-storage processes. Our study suggests that future climate change may affect the ecosystem functioning of patterned peatlands by altering the contribution of pattern-forming mechanisms to redistribution of water and nutrients within these systems.

AB The concentration of atmospheric methane is strongly linked to variations in Earth's climate. Currently, we can directly reconstruct the total atmospheric concentration of methane, but not individual terms of the methane cycle. Northern wetlands, dominated by Sphagnum, are an important contributor of atmospheric methane, and we seek to understand the methane cycle in these systems. We present a novel method for quantifying the proportion of carbon Sphagnum assimilates from its methanotrophic symbionts using stable isotope ratios of leaf-wax biomarkers. Carbon isotope ratios of Sphagnum compounds are determined by two competing influences, water content and the isotope ratio of source carbon. We disentangled these effects using a combined hydrogen and carbon isotope approach. We constrained Sphagnum water content using the contrast between the hydrogen isotope ratios of Sphagnum and vascular plant biomarkers. We then used Sphagnum water content to calculate the carbon isotope ratio of Sphagnum's carbon pool. Using a mass balance equation, we calculated the proportion of recycled methane contributed to the Sphagnum carbon pool, "PRM." We quantified PRM in peat monoliths from three microhabitats in the Mer Bleue peatland complex. Modern studies have shown that water table depth and vegetation have strong influences on the peatland methane cycle on instrumental time scales. With this new approach, delta C-13 of Sphagnum compounds are now a useful tool for investigating the relationships among hydrology, vegetation, and methanotrophy in Sphagnum peatlands over the time scales of entire peatland sediment records, vital to our understanding of the global carbon cycle through the Late Glacial and Holocene.

AB Grazing-oriented drainage of alpine/boreal wetlands has been broadly implemented to meet the increasing demand for animal products. However, the annual methane (CH4) emissions from alpine fens degraded due to drainage for grazing have not been well characterized clue to a lack of year-round observations. In this study, the year-round CH4 fluxes from a degraded alpine fen that is typical in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were measured. The temperature sensitivity of the CH4 emissions during the nongrowing season (NGS) was different between the microsites with and without CH4 uptake during the growing season (GS), showing apparent activation energy of 59-61 vs. 22-43 kJ mol(-1) (or variation folds induced by the 10-degree change (i.e., Q(10)): 2.61-2.74 vs. 1.38-1.91). The CH4 emissions amounted to 0.2-63.3 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (with 0.8 to 41.4 kg C ha(-1) and 0.9 to 21.9 kg C ha(-1) in the GS and NGS, respectively), which were significantly (P < 0.05) related to the distances to the drainage ditch or water tables across the six microsites. As a key factor, the water table determined the role of the CH4 emissions during freezing/thawing. For cool/cold/alpine wetlands with no CH4 uptake in the GS, a mean factor of 1.52 (within a range of 1.00-2.44 at the 95% confidence interval), corresponding to an NGS contribution of 34% (ranging from 0 to 59%), was recommended to upscale the GS emissions to annual totals. Degradation of the native peat marshes in the Zoige region (originally the largest area of alpine wetlands) due to intentional drainage has greatly reduced the quantities of CH4 emissions. Additional studies are still needed to minimize the large uncertainties in CH4 emissions estimates for the changes in alpine wetlands in this region and for the entire TP. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The distribution pattern of relict and specialised species in calcareous fens was revealed to be non-stochastic, with ancient fens harbouring more of these species than younger ones. This phenomenon could be caused by long-lasting in situ survivals over millennia, but direct palaeoecological evidence is lacking. We addressed the question whether at least some ancient calcareous fens indeed retained open-fen patches throughout the Holocene, using a palaeoecological approach involving proxies with different taphonomies (pollen, vascular plants, bryophytes, molluscs). We identified three old fens in the Western Carpathians, where several postglacial relict species have recently been found, and we reconstructed their histories with respect to sedimentary processes, vegetation structure and dynamics of relict species. The development at all the sites started with a (semi)-open fen community dominated by sedges and brown mosses. The site with the highest recent number of relict species was reconstructed to harbour open patches continually since the late Glacial to the present, including the middle Holocene when open-fen patches were restricted. By contrast, at the site with the lowest recent number of relict species, a large sedimentary hiatus suggested peat mineralisation or erosion that prevented the survival of light-demanding species. At all the sites, characteristic snails of European Glacial periods occurred during fen initiation, but disappeared around the early/middle Holocene transition. The probability of a relict species being present in a modern fen community increases with fen age, but it also depends on the continual existence of open-fen patches and peat accumulation throughout the middle Holocene.

AB Three developmental stages should be discerned in bogs: (1) inundated, (2) sphagnous or oligotrophic-mesotrophic, the most typical, and (3) senile or dystrophic. The peat deposit consists of two horizons clearly differing in ecology. On the surface, there is a thin (3 to 60 cm) aerated active layer of slightly decomposed peat. It contains a large amount of water, but the water is almost totally unavailable for higher plants. The content of free water is 17%. In summer, the plants, which are xenomorphic, often suffer from drought. The peat deposit is underlain by an inert horizon that always contains a large amount of water and demonstrates an acute oxygen deficit.

AB A study was made of the effect of soil and crop type on the soil and total ecosystem respiration rates in agricultural soils in southern Finland. The main interest was to compare the soil respiration rates in peat and two different mineral soils growing barley, grass and potato. Respiration measurements were conducted during the growing season with (1) a closed-dynamic ecosystem respiration chamber, in which combined plant and soil respiration was measured and ( 2) a closed-dynamic soil respiration chamber which measured only the soil and root-derived respiration. A semi-empirical model including separate functions for the soil and plant respiration components was used for the total ecosystem respiration (TER), and the resulting soil respiration parameters for different soil and crop types were compared. Both methods showed that the soil respiration in the peat soil was 2-3 times as high as that in the mineral soils, varying from 0.11 to 0.36 mg (CO2) m(-2) s(-1) in the peat soil and from 0.02 to 0.17 mg (CO2) m(-2) s(-1) in the mineral soils. The difference between the soil types was mainly attributed to the soil organic C content, which in the uppermost 20 cm of the peat soil was 24 kg m(-2), being about 4 times as high as that in the mineral soils. Depending on the measurement method, the soil respiration in the sandy soil was slightly higher than or similar to that in the clay soil. In each soil type, the soil respiration was highest on the grass plots. Higher soil respiration parameter values (R-s0, describing the soil respiration at a soil temperature of 10degreesC, and obtained by modelling) were found on the barley than on the potato plots. The difference was explained by the different cultivation history of the plots, as the potato plots had lain fallow during the preceding summer. The total ecosystem respiration followed the seasonal evolution in the leaf area and measured photosynthetic flux rates. The 2-3-fold peat soil respiration term as compared to mineral soil indicates that the cultivated peat soil ecosystem is a strong net CO2 source.

AB In the oil sands mining region near Fort McMurray, Alberta, strategies to construct wetlands and peatlands and methods to evaluate their success are just beginning. Reclamation of wetlands is particularly challenging in this region as growing seasons are short, precipitation is variable and often limiting, and the presence of elevated salinity associated with the mining process can be harmful to vegetation. As part of their reclamation programme, Syncrude Canada Ltd constructed a series of test plots (termed cells) to examine specific procedures and management strategies associated with wetland reclamation. In this study, water balance of 12 cells (each similar to 400m(2) in area) with different soil and vegetation treatments were studied over two growing seasons to understand the influence of soil salvage, vegetation, and placement strategy on water balance components. Cells were constructed in (i) the summer or winter, (ii) with either stockpiled material planted with vegetation or with soils directly transplanted from a nearby wetland and (iii) with soil depths of 15, 50 and 100 cm. Cells were built on a liner to eliminate leakage and were watered using an irrigation system along with receiving precipitation inputs. In 2010, cells were irrigated between similar to 100 and 400 mm, and water tables were maintained at or near the surface for the duration of the growing season at most cells. In 2011, watering was reduced considerably, and water tables were on average much lower. Evapotranspiration (ET) losses measured using lysimetres varied throughout the season and among cells. ET rates were greater in 2010 than in 2011 because of wet conditions at the surface, and cells placed in the winter and with shallower organic soils (15 cm) also had enhanced ET. Cumulative water balance suggests that some cells had considerable leakage despite being constructed atop a geotextile. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions from the northern high-latitude region represent potentially significant biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. We compiled a database of growing-season CH4 emissions from terrestrial ecosystems located across permafrost zones, including 303 sites described in 65 studies. Data on environmental and physical variables, including permafrost conditions, were used to assess controls on CH4 emissions. Water table position, soil temperature, and vegetation composition strongly influenced emissions and had interacting effects. Sites with a dense sedge cover had higher emissions than other sites at comparable water table positions, and this was an effect that was more pronounced at low soil temperatures. Sensitivity analysis suggested that CH4 emissions from ecosystems where the water table on average is at or above the soil surface (wet tundra, fen underlain by permafrost, and littoral ecosystems) are more sensitive to variability in soil temperature than drier ecosystems (palsa dry tundra, bog, and fen), whereas the latter ecosystems conversely are relatively more sensitive to changes of the water table position. Sites with near-surface permafrost had lower CH4 fluxes than sites without permafrost at comparable water table positions, a difference that was explained by lower soil temperatures. Neither the active layer depth nor the organic soil layer depth was related to CH4 emissions. Permafrost thaw in lowland regions is often associated with increased soil moisture, higher soil temperatures, and increased sedge cover. In our database, lowland thermokarst sites generally had higher emissions than adjacent sites with intact permafrost, but emissions from thermokarst sites were not statistically higher than emissions from permafrost-free sites with comparable environmental conditions. Overall, these results suggest that future changes to terrestrial high-latitude CH4 emissions will be more proximately related to changes in moisture, soil temperature, and vegetation composition than to increased availability of organic matter following permafrost thaw.

AB The oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) of plant cellulose has been widely used to study ecohydrological processes of ecosystems as well as to reconstruct past climate conditions in terrestrial climate archives. These applications are grounded on a key assumption that the biochemical fractionation during cellulose synthesis is a constant around +27 parts per thousand and is not affected by environmental factors. Here we revisit the influence of temperature on biochemical fractionation factor during cellulose synthesis using a global compilation ofSphagnumcellulose delta O-18 data.Sphagnum(peat mosses) are known for inhabiting waterlogged peatlands and possessing unique physiological strategy in that their cellulose delta O-18 could closely reflect growing-season precipitation delta O-18. Although within-site cellulose delta O-18 variability shows a median standard deviation of 0.7-0.8 parts per thousand resulting from different degrees of evaporative enrichment of(18)O in metabolic leaf water, this evaporative enrichment should be a small quantity due to the external capillary "water buffer" inSphagnummosses. Using site-specific minimum cellulose delta O-18 data that most likely reflect the signal of unevaporated source water, we show that the apparent enrichment factor between cellulose and precipitation delta O-18 increases with decreasing air temperature. In particular, the apparent enrichment factor could reach values as high as +32 parts per thousand when growth temperature is below 5 degrees C. This observational dataset extends the support for the temperature-dependent oxygen isotope fractionation in plant cellulose synthesis previously demonstrated in laboratory experiment, with implications for paleoclimate and plant physiology studies that employ cellulose delta O-18 measurements, particularly in alpine regions.

AB The aim of this study was to asses how the variability in carbon gas exchange at the plant community scale affected the C gas exchange estimates at the ecosystem scale in a fen that was homogeneous in a micrometeorological sense, that is, had an even surface topography and plant cover. CO2 and CH4 exchange was measured at the plant community scale with chambers and at the ecosystern scale with the eddy covariance (EC) technique. Community-scale measurements were upscaled to the ecosystem scale by weighting the community-specific estimates by the area of the community. All communities were net CO, sinks and CH4 sources during the growing season, but net ecosystem production (NEP) and CH4 emissions ranged from 21 to 190 g CO2-C m(-2) and from 4.3 to 13 g CH4-C m(-2), respectively, between the communities. The seasonal estimates of NEP and CH4, upscaled to the 200 m radius from the EC tower, were 82 and 7.9 2 CH4-C m(-2). which agreed well with the EC measurements. As the communities differed markedly in their C gas dynamics. their proportions controlled the ecosystem scale estimates. Successful upscaling required detailed knowledge on the proportions and leaf area of the communities.

TI Paleoenvironmental response of midlatitudinal wetlands to

AB The early Paleogene is marked by multiple negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) that reflect massive short-term carbon cycle perturbations that coincide with significant warming during a high-p CO2 world, affecting both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Records of such hyperthermals from the marine-terrestrial interface (e.g., estuarine swamps and mire deposits) are therefore of great interest as their present-day counterparts are highly vulnerable to future climate and sea level change. Here, we assess paleoenvironmental changes of midlatitudinal late Paleocene-early Eocene peat mire records along the paleo-North Sea coast. We provide carbon isotope data of bulk organic matter (delta(TOC)-T-13C), organic carbon content (% TOC), and palynological data from an extensive peat mire deposited at a midlatitudinal (ca. 41 degrees N) coastal site (Schoningen, Germany). The delta(TOC)-T-13C data show a carbon isotope excursion of -1.3% (mean decrease in delta(TOC)-T-13C; -1.7% at the onset of CIE) coeval with a conspicuous Apectodinium acme. Due to the exceptionally large stratigraphic thickness of the CIE at Schoningen (10m of section) we established a detailed palynological record that indicates only minor changes in paleovegetation leading into and during this event. Instead, paleovegetation changes mostly follow natural successions in response to changes along the marine-terrestrial interface. The available age constraints for the Schoningen Formation hamper a solid assignment of the detected CIE to a particular hyperthermal such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) or any succeeding hyperthermal event such as the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2).
   Compared to other nearby peat mire records (Cobham, UK; Vasterival, F) it appears that wetland deposits around the Paleogene North Sea have a consistent CIE magnitude of ca. 1 : 3% in delta(TOC)-T-13C. Moreover, the Schoningen record shares major characteristics with the Cobham Lignite PETM record, including evidence for increased fire activity prior to the CIE, minor plant species change during the hyperthermal, a reduced CIE in delta(TOC)-T-13C, and drowning of the mire (marine ingressions) during much of the Schoningen CIE event. This suggests that either the Schoningen CIE reflects the PETM or that early Paleogene hyperthermals similarly affected paleoenvironmental conditions of a major segment of the paleo-North Sea coast.

TI Ecosystem-scale flux of CO2 from a restored vacuum harvested peatland
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE carbon dioxide; eddy correlation; evapotranspiration; peatland;
   restoration
AB At the ecosystem scale, the water and gas exchange processes are strongly coupled. Drainage and removal of a peatland's surface vegetation cover for peat harvesting alters its hydrology, and as a direct consequence the carbon budget. Previous studies have measured peatland-atmosphere carbon exchange using the chamber methodology. These studies have indicated that the spatial and temporal variability is large, suggesting the need for continuous ecosystem-scale measurements. This paper presents ecosystem scale measurements of the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) from a restored vacuum-harvested peatland in eastern Quebec, Canada, using the eddy correlation measurement approach.
   Results indicate that the adopted restoration practices reduce the loss of water from the peat. Evapotranspiration from the restored site was 20 and 25% less than that from an adjacent abandoned comparison site in 2000 and 2001 respectively. However, CO2 emissions remain large during non-snow periods (478 and 468 g C m(-2) in 2000 and 2001, respectively). The blockage of drainage ditches and the existence of a mulch cover at the site keep the moisture and thermal conditions more or less constant. Consequently, the CO2 flux, which is predominantly soil respiration, is strongly controlled by peat temperature fluctuations.

AB The vegetation of the Parinacota Province (18 degrees 12 ' S, 69 degrees 08 ' W) is studied using the Zurich-Montpellier school of phytosociology methods. The study area is located in a mountainous high andean environment, between 3200 and 5300 in of elevation, under the influence of tropical xeric to pluviseasonal bioclimates, with summer rainfall. Sixty-six phytosociological releves were performed in the field and were analyzed by tabular comparison using additional already published releves.
   Four phytosociological classes include all zonal vegetation of the study area: Para-strephio lepidophyllae-Fabianetea densae, supratropical, orotropical and cryoro-tropical dwarf-scrubs and grasslands; Polylepidetea tarapacano-besseri, orotropical Polylepis forests; Anthochloo lepidulae-Dielsiochloetea floribundae, cryorotropical vegetation of rocky and solifluxional soils. Supratropical desert scrubs of the alliance Ambrosio artemisioldis-Atriplicion imbricatae, are included in the new order Atriplicetalia imbricatae of the class Opuntietea sphaericae. Azonal vegetation is included into the classes Plantagini rigidae-Distichietea muscoldis (high andean mires and bogs), Potamogetonetea (submerged vegetation) and Lemnetea minoris (floating plant communities).
   Fourteen associations were recognized, five of which are new (Oreocereo Ieucotrichi-Ambrosietum artemisioidis, Lophopappeturn tarapacani, Diplostephio meyenii-Fabianetum ramulosae, Wernerio aretioidis-Parastrephietum lucidae and Senecioni zoellneri-Azorelletum compactae) and one is proposed as provisional (Deyeuxio curvulae-Wernerietum incisae). One new alliance (Diplostephio meyenii-Fabianion ramulosae) and one provisional alliance (Senecionion zoellneri-scorzoneraefolii) are described, discussing their syntaxonomy on the basis of 1115 releves already published for the involved classes, including the releves published here. Four vegetation belts were recognized according to the altitudinal variation of the vegetation physiognomy, floristic composition and bioclimate. Climatic influences of the temperature and humidity on the altitudinal zonation of vegetation belts are discussed in the context of tropical high Andes.
   Two main floristic elements can be distinguished in the Parinacota Province: Pacific Desert and Puna. The first one is the more important component at low altitude, decreasing its participation in higher elevation habitats, where the second becomes dominant. The origin of these elements is discussed on the basis of paleoecological data: the Pacific Desert element seems to be mainly associated to the development of aridity in the western slope of the Andes since the Miocene, while the Puna element appears to be originated due to the raise of the Andes during the Plio-Pletstocene. The phytogeographical affinities of the Parinacota Province with the Mediterranean Andes and the Paramo are also discussed.

AB The article presents result of the study of heavy metals (HM) content (zinc, copper, lead, and cadmium) in the vegetative mass of some plant species growing in anthropogenically transformed bog biogeocenoses of peatland "Zenginskoe" located in the central part of the Kirov region. Content of copper in vegetative mass of tested plant species varies from 5.78 to 15.10, zinc - from 8.04 to 33.50, cadmium - from 0.02 to 0.61, lead - from 0.16 to 0.79 mg/kg of dry matter. On the basis of the obtained data, the plants of Rosa majalis accumulated zinc (8.04-9.76 mg/kg), lead (0.16-0.27 mg/kg) and cadmium (0.02-0.08 mg/kg) in lowest concentration among the test species. Betula pubescens and Salix caprea plants have accumulated all the studied HM more actively than other species. S. caprea leaves show the highest content of all four studied elements (Cu - 10.65-15.10; Zn - 26.08-33.50; Cd - 0.48-0.61; Pb - 0.58-0.79 mg/kg). Compared to the averaged values of elements content in leaf tissues of terrestrial plants, the studied species growing on dried peat soils accumulate minor amounts of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in the aboveground mass and therefore should not experience toxic effects of HM. In general, the values of element content are close to the average values of HM content in plants growing on automorphic soils of the Kirov region. However, individual elements in plants growing on bog soil are accumulated in much lower concentrations: for copper in all species (by 1.5-2.5 times), with the exception of Rubus idaeus; for zinc - in Pyrola rotundifolia by 2.0-2.5 times (10.34-14.50 mg/kg); for cadmium and lead - in P. rotundifolia by 2-3 times (0.11-0.23 and 0.27-0.40 mg/kg, respectively), and in R. majalis by 3-6 times (0.02-0.08 and 0.16-0.27 mg/kg, respectively).

AB Spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of dissolved gases (CH4, CO2, and O-2) in peat cores were studied using membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MLMS). Variations in vertical gas profiles were observed between random peat cores taken from hollows on the same peat bog. Methane concentrations in profiles (0-30 cm) generally increased with depth and reached maximum values in the range of 200-450 mu M CH4 below about 13-cm depth. In some profiles, a peak of dissolved methane was observed at 7-cm depth, Oxygen penetrated to approximately 2-cm depth in the hollows. The sampling probe was used to continuously monitor CH4, CO2, and O-2 concentrations at fixed depths in peat cores over periods of several days. The concentration of dissolved CO2 and O-2 at 1-cm depth oscillated over a 24-h period with the maximum of CO, concentration corresponding with the minimum of O-2 Diurnal variations in CO2 but not CH4 were measured at 15-cm depth; dissolved CO2 levels decreased during daylight hours to a constant minimum concentration of 4.85 mM. This report also describes the application of MIMS for the measurement of gaseous diffusion rates in peat using an inert gas (argon); the value of D, the diffusion coefficient, was 2.07 x 10(-8) m(2) s(-1).

AB The main goals of this study were to determine the delta(15)N signature of quantitatively important boreal bog plants as basis for discussing their N sources, and to assess the effects of five different 3 year N treatments (i.e. 0, 5, 10 20 and 40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) on the bog plants and surface peat at different depths (i.e. 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 cm) by using N-15 as tracer. Plants and peat were analyzed for N concentration, N-15 natural abundance and N-15 at.%. From the results we draw three main conclusions: First, the relative importance of different N sources is species-specific among bog plants. Second, an annual addition of 5 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) was sufficient to significantly increase the N concentration in Sphagnum mosses, liverworts and shallow rooted vascular plants, and an annual addition of 40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) during 3 years was not sufficient to increase the N concentration in deep rooted plants, although the 15N content increased continuously, indicating a possible longer term effect. Third, an annual addition of 40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) during 3 years increased the N content in surface peat at depths of 5 and 10 cm, but not at depths of 20 and 40 cm, indicating the capacity of the living Sphagnum mosses and the surface peat to take up deposited N, and thereby function as a filter.

AB Fourteen tree-ring chronologies developed from 788 peatland Scots pines sampled at sites in Estonia, Belarus and Sweden were compared for common growth trends and possible links to regional climate dynamics. Several synchronous growth release events were detected, especially during the 1910s, 1930s, and around 1970 and 1990, indicating that hydrological shifts and associated tree growth responses have been governed by similar forcing mechanisms, at least during the 20th century. In general, the best agreements were observed between the tree populations from Estonia and Belarus, but synchronous growth changes could also be detected between the Swedish and Estonian material. Trends detected in single tree-ring chronologies may be linked to local peatland management or land-use changes, whereas common variations detected at multiple sites are more likely linked to hydrological changes in the peatlands associated with regional climate dynamics. Understanding the links between climate and processes that involve peatland hydrology and vegetation responses is important since peatland ecosystems are key players in the global carbon cycle.

AB The Harmanc?k Basin, in the north-easternmost Miocene graben in western Anatolia, hosts a 12.6-m-thick coal seam located in the Keles coalfield, in which coals are being exploited by open-cast mining methods. Syngenetic clinoptilolite/heulandite-type zeolite formation in the upper part of coal seam and carbonaceous clayey diato-mite as a roof rock have been identified for the first time, and the palaeoenviromental reconstruction of the coal seam was conducted using a multidisciplinary approach. The coal facies and palynological data show that vegetation and depositional changes took place during the middle Miocene, which resulted in vertical variations in elemental and mineralogical compositions. During the initial stages of mire development woody vegetation (e. g. pollen with affinity to Cupressaceae) prevailed, telmatic conditions were common, and preservation of organic matter was high due to anoxic conditions. Thus, relatively low-ash yield was observed in the lower and middle parts of the coal seam. Furthermore, the presence of kaolinite and smectite-type clay mineral aggregates in these parts of the coal seam suggests that alteration of synchronous volcanic inputs took place under weak acidic to neutral conditions. In contrast, limnotelmatic conditions prevailed during the late stages of peat-accumulation, and macrophytes coinciding with herbaceous peat-forming vegetation (e.g. Osmundaceae, Polypodiaceae, and Nymphaeaceae) were dominant. The elevated Gelification Index (GI) values in the uppermost parts of the coal seam could be related to development of alkaline conditions in the palaeomires, which also caused formation of syngenetic clinoptilolite/heulandite-type zeolite from the alkaline activations of synchronous volcanic inputs. Even though palynological data points to the prevalence of freshwater conditions during peat-accumulation, B enrichments along Sr/Ba ratio higher than 1.0 could point to possible marine influence; however, no Neogene marine deposits have been identified in the Harmacik Basin. Nevertheless, the SEM-EDX data show the presence of traceable Ba and Sr in clinoptilolite/heulandite grains, and Sr-bearing barite around feldspar grains in the studied samples from the upper parts of the coal seam. This implies K-feldspars and K-rich alkali-feldspars, derived from synchronous volcanic ash fall, altered under alkaline conditions. Moreover, alginite proportions increased towards the upper parts of the seam, while relatively high Hydrogen Index (HI) values were reached in the uppermost part of coal seam and carbonaceous clayey diatomite roof-rock sample. Furthermore, palynolgical data imply that vegetation changes towards the roof of the coal seam reflect the progressive development of more humid conditions and nutrient-rich surface waters, which favoured increased algal activity.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes in boreal peatlands are vulnerable to global change, including climate warming, elevated nitrogen (N) deposition, and vegetation composition change. However, few studies focus on the interactions of these factors, particularly combining all of them, which leads to a large degree of uncertainty in predicting CH4 emissions from peatlands in the future. In this study, experimental warming, N addition, and vegetation composition change were conducted for five years at a boreal peatland in western Newfoundland, Canada. We found that graminoid absence substantially decreased CH4 emissions by 72% owing to the reduction of root exudates for CH4 production and aerenchyma for CH4 transport; however, this negative effect disappeared under the combination of warming and N addition, which can be attributed to the elevated temperature sensitivity of CH4. Additionally, we observed that vegetation productivity was the main control when the graminoid was present, but not the major control when the shrub was present only, suggesting the proper parameters should be selected under different vegetation compositions so as to accurately project CH4 emissions in the context of climate change. Compared with the studies focusing on one or two environmental changes, this experiment is valuable for providing empirical evidence on the parameterization of CH4 fluxes in the biogeochemical model of boreal peatlands and in the global coupled climate-carbon model.

DE ombrotrophic bogs; microbial ecology; methane; climate change
ID METHANE; WETLANDS
AB Gases are produced from wetlands when plant biomass is degraded by microbial consortia, producing carbon dioxide aerobically and methane when oxygen is lacking. In anaerobic waterlogged situations, such as the catotelm of ombrotrophic bogs, this methane forms minute gas bubbles that severely reduce the hydraulic conductivity and hence the degradation of biomass due to the lack of nutrients. The bogs thus became carbon sinks, formed from the partially degraded biomass that accumulates as peat. The results of an investigation of an ombrotrophic bog, Mer Bleue, Ontario, Canada are summarized here, and the effects that climate change may have on such bogs are discussed. Any change of the water table in wetlands will have a substantial effect upon their ecology. If the water table should fall allowing bogs to become aerobic, most of the accumulated biomass carbon could be returned to the atmosphere by degradation to carbon dioxide, and as well, methane entrapped within the matrix would be released directly to the atmosphere. If on the other hand, the bogs are flooded, then the entrapped bubbles will coalesce allowing the gas to escape to the atmosphere, while at the same time the degradation of the peat will be enhanced.

AB Understanding spatial variability of water table depth (WTD) in larger peatland area is crucial for peat conservation. This study investigated spatial patterns of WTDs in a peatland watershed of about 0.151 km(2), located in the Zoige basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Using conventional dipwells, we measured WTDs on 5/ 17/2017, 5/20/2017, 5/23/2017, 7/17/2017, and 9/18/2017 at 114, 103, 105, 77, and 81 locations, as well as peat depths (H) and elevations at 119 and 831 locations over the watershed, respectively. Then, we performed hotspot analysis and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling, showing (1) highly localized spatial patterns of WTDs, H, and S (slope gradient, calculated from elevations), and (2) the area that had statistically significant local coefficients for H ranged between 51 and 57% of the total watershed area, while that for S was only < 11%. These complex spatial patterns of WTDs were further illustrated by our results of examining WTD changes in the lateral and longitudinal directions for two types of channels, deep gullies whose beds are deep and cut through the peat layer and shallow artificial ditches. The findings suggested that spatial and temporal changes of WTDs at the watershed scale may only be examined by collecting in situ samples, which may be achieved using an efficient sampling method provided in this study.

AB Pollen, spore, macrofossil and carbon data from a peatland near Cordova, Alaska, reveal insights into the climate-vegetation-carbon interactions from the initiation of the Holocene, c. the last 11.5 ka, to the present (1 ka = 1000 calibrated years before present where 0 = 1950 CE). The Holocene period is characterized by early deposition of gyttja in a pond environment with aquatics such as Nuphar polysepalum and Potamogeton, and a significant regional presence of Alnus crispa subsp. sinuata. Carbon accumulation (50 g/m(2)/a) was high for a short interval in the early Holocene when Sphagnum peat accumulated, but was followed by a major decline to 13 g/m(2)/a from 7 to 3.7 ka when Cyperaceae and ericads such as Rhododendron (formerly Ledum) groenlandicum expanded. This shift to sedge growth is representative of many peatlands throughout the south-central region of Alaska, and indicates a drier, more evaporative environment with a large decline in carbon storage. The subsequent return to Sphagnum peat after 4 ka in the Neoglacial represents a widespread shift to moister, cooler conditions, which favored a resurgence of ericads, such as Andromeda polifolia, and increased carbon accumulation rate. The sustained Alnus expansion visible in the top 10 cm of the peat profile is correlative with glacial retreat and warming of the region in the last century, and suggests this colonization will continue as temperature increases and ice melts.

AB Ombrotrophic peat bogs form an independent ecosystem fed by atmospheric precipitation. There is a correlation between depth and time, thus sections of peat taken from various depths can indicate the deposition of several elements from both natural and anthropogenic sources. A peat core of 40 cm in length was taken from a peat bog in southern Poland and cut into 2-cm sections. The peat core was dated using the natural radionuclide Pb-210. Additionally, pollen analysis was performed in order to corroborate the Pb-210 dating. Eighteen elements and the ash content have been determined in all peat sections. Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence analysis (EDXRF) was applied in this work for simultaneous elemental analysis. The concentration depth profiles for the determined elements and ash content profile were constructed. The results show strong time-dependent variations in the concentrations of the different elements. An interpretation of the data is given and correlation between possible influencing factors is discussed. High concentrations of Pb and Zn indicate their anthropogenic origin.

AB Drainage and cultivation of peat soils stimulates soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization, which substantially increases CO(2) emissions from soils. Large uncertainties are associated with this CO(2) flux, and little data are available, especially in Norway. The objective of the present research was to estimate C losses from cultivated peatlands in West Norway by three independent methods: (1) long-term monitoring of subsidence rates, (2) changes in ash contents, and (3) soil CO(2) flux measurements. Subsidence of cultivated peat soils averaged about 2.5 cm year(-1). We estimated that peat loss and compaction were respectively responsible for 38% and 62% of the total subsidence during a 25-year period after drainage. Based on this estimate the corresponding C loss equals 0.80 kg C m(-2) year(-1). The observed increase in mineral concentration of the topsoil of cultivated peat is proportional to their C loss, providing no mineral particles other than lime and fertilizers are added to the soil. Using this novel approach across 11 sites, we estimated a mean C loss of 0.86 kg C m(-2) year(-1). Soil CO(2) flux measurements, corrected for autotrophic respiration, yielded a C loss estimate from cultivated peat soils of 0.60 kg C m(-2) year(-1). The three methods yielded fairly similar estimates of C losses from Norwegian cultivated peatlands. Cultivated peatlands in Norway cover an estimated 63,000 ha. Total annual C losses from peat degradation were estimated to range between 1.8 and 2 million tons CO(2) year(-1), which equals about 3-4% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from Norway.

AB Mud-bottom hollows with bare peat surface are common features of raised bogs in the boreal zone. Due to retarded peat accumulation, these hollows promote changes in plant cover, microtopography and carbon accumulation. We undertook a 16-year study of eight permanent plots in mud-bottom hollows to assess their durability, regularities and causes of development. Annual changes in the areas of plant assemblage types in the plots averaged around 20 %, and changes during the entire study period approached 90 %. Bare peat surfaces existed for 3-12 years on average before being overgrown by lateral expansion of the bordering Sphagnum carpet (average rate of advance 4.1 +/- 1.3 cm yr(-1)) or by clumps of Rhynchospora alba. The annual changes in representation of plant assemblages fluctuated through time and were related to weather factors. The overgrowth of bare peat by Sphagnum carpet was favoured by wetter conditions, whereas overgrowth by the R. alba dominated plant assemblage was temporally less regular and independent of weather.

AB Global warming is an important issue which is leading to considerable changes in biomes. Environmental biologists are continuously assessing how global warming is going to impact the current population. Peatlands are one of the most important component of the terrestrial ecosystems which makes only 3% of them but contain around 40% of soil organic carbon. The composition of peatland vegetation impacts a range of ecosystem functions, therefore, with a change in composition, the behavior and structure of peatland plant communities are predicted to change. This work is focused on the response of Sphagnum peatland (in Poland), to the manipulated environmental conditions. The experimental design consisted of four treatments (control, warming, reduced precipitation, and a combination of warming & reduced precipitation), three replicates of each. Active warming with infrared heaters ((similar to)1.0-1.4 degrees C peat temperature increase) and an automatic curtain to reduce precipitation ((similar to)30% reduction in the rain) was applied continuously since 2015. The warming and reduced precipitation caused a significant variation in the vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), Water Band Index (WBI), and Chlorophyll Green Index (CIgreen) between manipulated sites. The abundance of major plant species was recorded between manipulated sites. The prompt chlorophyll fluorescence measurement was performed in the peak of the vegetation season of August 2017 which had shown a significant variation in photosynthetic induction curve and different photosynthetic parameters from the same plant species in between the manipulated sites. The data clearly indicate that a short-term climate manipulation resulted in the change of plant abundance and its physiology, which varied for different plant species. Our study indicates that the different plant species respond differently to climate change. The study also proposes the significance of simple vegetation indices for peatland vegetation observation.

AB Palsas develop as permafrost aggradation uplifts peat out of the zone influenced by groundwater. Here we relate N-15 values to C/N ratios along depth profiles through palsas in two peatlands near Abisko, northern Sweden, to identify perturbation of the peat. The perturbation by uplift as well as the potential nutrient input from the adjacent hollows can be detected in soil N-15 values when related to the C/N ratio at the same depth. Nine out of ten profiles show a perturbation at the depth where peat was uplifted by permafrost. Palsa uplift could be detected by the N-15 depth pattern, with the highest N-15 values at the so-called turning point. The N-15 values increase above and decrease below the turning point, when permafrost initiated uplift. Onset of permafrost aggradation calculated from peat accumulation rates was between 80 and 545years ago, with a mean of 242 ( +/- 66) years for Stordalen and 365 ( +/- 53) years for Storflaket peatland. The mean ages of permafrost aggradation are within the Little Ice Age. Depth profiles of N-15, when related to C/N ratio, seem to be a suitable tool to detect perturbation and uplift of palsas.

AB Natural habitats are lost and fragmented by urbanization globally, resulting in isolated urban remnants of low biodiversity, devoid of specialist species. This homogenization of the urban landscape can be redressed if urban biodiversity hotspots are identified and conserved. Mires have the potential of being such refuges, since they host many mire specialist species of, e.g. arthropods. Here we investigated twenty pine mires that differed in urbanization level (low, intermediate and high) in southern Finland by evaluating the responses of carabid beetle and spider species and communities to potential landscape (level of urbanization, total mire area) and local (pH of peat, vegetation cover, wood volume) drivers. Pitfall trapping was used to collect the arthropods. We showed that high levels of urbanization have a negative effect on mire arthropod biodiversity. However, urban mire community structure seems not to be very different from rural communities as urban mires are still inhabited by mire specialists. Furthermore, tree-covered parts of urbanized mires can serve as refuges for rare forest specialist species and Sphagnum mosses play an important role in supporting mire species and communities, thus Sphagnum growth should be promoted. We showed that urban mires can be considered urban biodiversity hotspots and their protection should be secured in urban development.

AB 1. Peatlands are a significant store of global carbon (C) and may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Understanding the drivers of C cycling in peatlands is therefore important for predicting feedbacks to climate change. One such driver may be the identity of component plant species. 2. Moss species contribute significantly to peatland vegetation, yet we understand comparatively little of their role in short-term C cycling and whether that role is consistent regardless of environmental context. 3. We examined the impact of three dominant, co-occurring moss species (Hypnum jutlandicum, Sphagnum capillifolium and Plagiothecium undulatum) on C cycling across a long-term fire frequency experiment, where plots have been burnt every 10 years, every 20 years or have not been burnt since 1954. We measured species effects on in situ net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and decomposition environments, and moss species litter decomposition rates in a laboratory experiment. The fire experiment also provided an ideal opportunity to test whether moss species effects were consistent regardless of context. 4. Moss-dominated patches were on average net sources of CO2 over the main growing period, with Sphagnum-dominated patches showing the lowest NEE. The presence of mosses reduced peat temperature, but this was insufficient to cause differences in the decomposition rate of a standard substrate. Sphagnum and Hypnum litter decomposed more slowly (17 and 16% mass loss, respectively) than Plagiothecium litter (64% mass loss) over a 42-week incubation period. 5. Fire frequency treatments had few effects on measures of C cycling. Moss effects were generally consistent regardless of fire frequency treatment, but Plagiothecium and Sphagnum litter collected from the no-fire plots had higher rates of decomposition than litter collected from the plots burnt more frequently. 6. In summary, postfire, both inter- and intraspecific differences in mosses had significant effects on short-term C cycling. Consequently, changes in both moss species composition and variation within species may need to be taken into account to accurately predict C cycling in peatland ecosystems subject to fire.

AB The preservation of the primary stable isotope compositions of peat-forming plants in peat was tested along a short (<3.5 km), steep (739-1393 m asl) altitudinal transect. The stable isotope compositions in plant cube samples taken from the surface of mires were compared with the stable isotope compositions in cube samples of the underlying young peat for the following elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur (HCNOS). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were also compared. Statistically significant correlations (p <= 0.03) for the pairs of plant-peat samples among all analyzed elements suggested that the stable isotope compositions of peat are primarily determined by the stable isotope compositions of the peat-forming plants. This implies that preservation of the plants' primary stable isotope variations (e.g., from the time of plant growth) is well preserved in young peat and that the overall decomposition during peat formation has only a secondary influence on the final peat stable isotope composition. We were able to detect relative variations in stable isotope composition between plants growing in different conditions and/or at different times. The EPR results confirmed the more anoxic conditions of decomposition at lower altitudes and more oxic conditions at higher altitudes, which involved an increase in oxygen centered free radicals. The observed correlations between the stable isotope compositions of plants and altitude indicated that the delta C-13 value of peat-forming plants is primarily controlled by growing season temperature, while the delta H-2 and delta O-18 values are controlled by stable isotope composition of surface water. The delta N-15 and delta S-34 values appear to reflect different distributions and concentrations of anthropogenic pollution at the sites of peat-forming plant growth. A strong and statistically significant correlation between altitude/temperature and delta C-13 of plants and peats indicates a good preservation of primary stable carbon isotope composition. Thus, the analysis of peat stable isotope compositions could be useful for paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental evaluations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrologic patterns and soil characteristics were investigated at three high-elevation wetlands in southeastern Kentucky, Martins Fork, Kentenia, and Four Level. Despite below-normal precipitation, water tables at all sites remained within 35 cm of the surface and fluctuated seasonally with peak heights during early spring. Seasonal precipitation contributed substantially to Martins Fork hydrology, while ground water was the primary hydrologic source for Kentenia and Four Level. Vertical hydraulic gradients varied among the sites. Martins Fork was distinguished by strong seasonal downwelling, while Kentenia and Four Level exhibited upwelling and downwelling patterns. All sites exhibited prominent soil hydromorphic features immediately below the surface horizon, moderate organic carbon content (< 6.5%), and a pH range between 4.4 and 6.2 according to the buffering capacities of local lithologies. The sites were dominated by sandy loam texture and siliceous mineralogy, reflecting the influence of sandstone parent materials prevalent in the area. Radiocarbon dating established that soil surface layers (<= 30 cm) dated less than 250 years B.P., while soil horizons at 100-cm depths varied from 770-1,870 years B.P. Mean C sequestration rates ranged from 0.025 kg C m(-2) at Four Level to 0.043 kg C m(-2) for Martins Fork and Kentenia, with C accumulation in the upper 100 cm in the range of 19.5-36.7 kg C m(-2). Each wetland exhibited distinctive hydrologic and soil properties derived from geologic, geomorphic, and vegetative influences.

AB Arctic peatlands are an important part of the global carbon cycle, accumulating atmospheric carbon as organic matter since the Late glacial. Current methods for understanding the changing efficiency of the peatland carbon sink rely on peatlands with an undisturbed stratigraphy. Here we present a method of estimating primary carbon accumulation rate from a site where permafrost processes have either vertically or horizontally translocated nearby carbon-rich sediment out of stratigraphic order. Briefly, our new algorithm estimates the probability of the age of deposition of a random increment of sediment in the core. The method assumes that if sediment age is measured at even depth increments, dates are more likely to occur during intervals of higher accumulation rate and vice versa. Multiplying estimated sedimentation rate by measured carbon density yields carbon accumulation rate. We perform this analysis at the Imnavait Creek Peatland, near the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research network site at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Using classical radiocarbon age modeling, we find unreasonably high rates of carbon accumulation at various Holocene intervals. With our new method, we find accumulation rate changes that are in improved agreement within the context of other sites throughout Alaska and the rest of the Circum-Arctic region.

DE palaeoecology; pollen analysis; vegetational history; climatic change;
   late Quaternary; Nepal; Himalayas
AB The late Quaternary vegetation and climatic history at high altitude in eastern Nepal was studied through stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating and pollen analysis. The Thulo Pokhari lake (27 degrees 41' N, 87 degrees 43' E, ca. 3980 m a.s.l.) is just above the subalpine Abies spectabilis-Betula utilis forest zone and surrounded by Rhododendron scrub. The climate in the studied area is very humid under the influence of the monsoon. Silty sediments suggesting lake conditions prevailed at the lower part of the sediment samples, whereas the upper part consisted mainly of herbaceous peat indicating a mire condition. The pollen record extends back to ca. 11000 yr BP. Although the absence of major changes between the pollen assemblages of the Pleistocene and those in the Holocene was attributed to the situation of the sampling plot above the forest limit, the results suggest the following history. (I) The abundance of Pinus pollen around 11000 yr BP represents expansion of the area unoccupied by late successional trees and/or a drier condition. Significant occurrence of Picea pollen is noteworthy, since this genus is absent in eastern Nepal at present in spite of its wide distribution throughout the neighbouring areas of the Himalayas. (2) The increase in abundance of Quercus pollen and the decline in Pinus pollen in the latest Pleistocene represent climatic amelioration favourable to late successional mesophytes. (3) The climate was most moist and mild in the SP-III, although the absolute age of the pollen zone is not distinct. The percentages of broadleaved trees such as Alnus, Betula, Carpinus and Corylus were increased at the expense of Quercus and coniferous pollen types. Sedimentation was interrupted by lake level decline and/or glacial advance during the period from ca. 11000-1600 yr BP. (4) The increase in abundance of coniferous pollen types such as Pinus, Abies and Tsuga indicates that the climate became drier and cooler, and the present subalpine forest zone composed of A. spectabilis, T. dumosa and Betula utilis was established around 1600 yr sp. The formation of bog or alpine meadow vegetation during the period was shown by the C-14 dates of the peat and the increase in Rosaceae and herbaceous pollen. (5) The increase in abundance of Ericaceae and Alnus pollen in the SP-V indicates that the present alpine Rhododendron scrub zone has been established since ca. 940 yr BP as a result of human influence on the original vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the decline in the proportion of arboreal pollen. Since the age of the initiation of human influence varies with the altitude and region, further study will be necessary to determine the accurate age.

AB The transformation of atmospherically deposited inorganic Hg to the toxic, organic form methylmercury (MeHg) is of serious ecological concern because MeHg accumulates in aquatic biota, including fish. Research has shown that tile Hg methylation reaction is dependent on the availability Of SO4 (as an electron acceptor) because SO4-reducing bacteria (SRB) mediate the biotic methylation of Hg. Much less research has investigated the possible organic C limitations to Hg methylation (i.e. from tile perspective of tile electron donor). Although peatlands are long-term stores of organic C, the C derived from peatland vegetation is of questionable microbial lability. This research investigated how both SO4 and organic C control net MeHg production using a controlled factorial addition design in 44 in situ peatland mesocosms. Two levels Of SO4 addition and energetic-equivalcnt additions (i.e. same number of electrons) of a number of organic C sources were used including glucose, acetate, lactate, coniferous litter leachate, and deciduous litter leachate. This study supports previous research demonstrating the stimulation of MeHg production from SO4 input alone (similar to 200 pg/L/day). None of the additions of organic C alone resulted in significant MeHg production. The combined addition Of SO4 and some organic C sources resulted in considerably more MeHg production (similar to 500 pg/L/day) than did the addition Of SO4 alone, demonstrating that the highest levels of MeHg production can be expected only where fluxes of both SO4 and organic C are delivered concurrently. When compared to a number of pore water samples taken from two nearby peatlands, MeHg concentrations resulting from the combined addition Of SO4 and organic C in this study were similar to MeHg "hot spots" found near the upland-peat land interface. The formation of MeHg "hot spots" at tile upland-peatland interface may be dependent oil concurrent inputs Of SO4 and organic C in runoff from the adjacent upland hillslopes. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. The results of a restoration experiment carried out on a permanent grassland on peaty, heavy clay in the Netherlands are described. The experiment started in 1985, 7 years after fertilizer application had ceased, and was designed to provide insight into ecologically significant processes accompanying restoration. An analysis was made of the effect of management regime and of raising the water table on nutrient availability, dry mailer production, tissue nutrient concentration, dynamics of species numbers and plant species replacement. Three management practices were compared: cutting and removal (RR), cutting and mulching (M M), sod removal in 1985, and thereafter cutting and removal of the hay (RS). Data are presented on changes during a 5-year period.
   2. No trend was discernible in soil pH, total C, N and P in the RR treatment; extractable P and K decreased sharply in the field with the raised groundwater level.
   3. Nine years after fertilizer application ceased, dry matter production had fallen from 10-11 to 6-7 t ha(-1) year(-1). In the subsequent 5 years of the experiment it declined to 5-6 t ha(-1) year(-1) when all cut biomass was removed. and to about 4 t ha(-1) year(-1) after sod removal. Mulching caused an increase to 11 t ha(-1) year(-1). No effect was seen of the raised water level.
   4. The dry matter yield of the first June cut in the RR treatment decreased. The tissue It concentration also decreased, but no increase of the tissue P concentration was detected. II was concluded that the availability of K and to some extent of P was more important than N availability in explaining the decrease in dry matter production. The tissue nutrient concentrations were not influenced by the water table.
   5. Sod removal to a depth of 5 cm resulted in the lowest productivity and the lowest tissue concentrations of P, while tissue concentrations of N and It were not affected.
   6. Raising the water level resulted in a more rapid establishment of species indicative of wet conditions, some of which invaded from nearby ditches.
   7. The trends of dominant species are described with a set of response models. The species were ranked from disappearing to colonizing species. The relationship between rank order of replacement and indicator values of species was investigated. Raising the water table resulted in species indicative of wet conditions becoming dominant, independently of vegetation management. The removal of nutrients resulted in the appearance of species with a lower maximal height, indicative of lower P and K availability.

AB Previous studies have shown a correspondence between the abundance of particular plant species and methane flux. Here, we apply multivariate analyses, and weighted averaging, to assess the suitability of vegetation composition as a predictor of methane flux. We developed a functional classification of the vegetation, in terms of a number of plant traits expected to influence methane production and transport, and compared this with a purely taxonomic classification at species level and higher. We applied weighted averaging and indirect and direct ordination approaches to six sites in the United Kingdom, and found good relationships between methane flux and vegetation composition (classified both taxonomically and functionally). Plant species and functional groups also showed meaningful responses to management and experimental treatments. In addition to the United Kingdom, we applied the functional group classification across different geographical regions (Canada and the Netherlands) to assess the generality of the method. Again, the relationship appeared good at the site level, suggesting some general applicability of the functional classification. The method seems to have the potential for incorporation into large-scale (national) greenhouse gas accounting programmes (in relation to peatland condition/management) using vegetation mapping schemes. The results presented here strongly suggest that robust predictive models can be derived using plant species data (for use in national-scale studies). For trans-national-scale studies, where the taxonomic assemblage of vegetation differs widely between study sites, a functional classification of plant species data provides an appropriate basis for predictive models of methane flux.

AB Paleoecological records suggest that growing season length and/or cloudiness may affect peatland carbon accumulation and testate amoeba-based environmental reconstructions, highlighting a need to understand how light intensity affects microbial communities. We shaded plots on two peatlands for two years to examine effects on testate amoeba communities, the relative abundance of mixotrophic and heterotrophic testate amoebae, transfer-function performance, and delta C-13 values of two species of mixotrophic testate amoebae. Surprisingly, relative abundance of mixotrophic species increased in shade, although compositional changes did not affect transfer-function performance. Shading did not affect delta C-13 values of Hyalosphenia papilio and Heleopera sphagni, which ranged from -23.5 to -19.6%o and -23.2 to -19.2%o, respectively. These delta C-13 values were higher than those of potential food sources and lower than literature-derived values for Chlorella, the zoochlorellae inhabiting mixotrophic testate amoebae. delta C-13 values thus suggest that these mixotrophic species obtain some carbon from Chiorella, although coupled dietary and isotope studies are needed to quantify this contribution. More research is needed to assess impacts of light variability on peatland microbial communities; however, carbon sources are recorded by delta C-13 values of testate amoebae, indicating potential for studies of carbon cycling and how mixotrophy varies temporally and spatially.

AB Drainage and cultivation have turned peatlands from carbon (C) sinks into hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Raising the water table and planting of winter cover crops are potential strategies to help reduce peat oxidation and re-initiate net C accumulation during the non-cropping period. However, the effects of these practices as well as their interactions on GHG emissions remain unclear. Here, we carried out an outdoor mesocosm experiment to elucidate the effect of water table levels (-30 cm and -50 cm) and winter cover crop cultivation (vetch, rye, no plant) on carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes during the winter period (November-April). Soil-atmosphere GHG exchange, GHG concentrations within the peat profile and soil water solute concentrations were monitored. Our results showed that high water table significantly reduced ecosystem respiration, while it had no net effect on N2O and CH4 fluxes. Uptake of available N by the cover crop significantly reduced nitrate in soil solution, thereby lowering the potential for leaching and both direct and indirect N2O emissions. No interactive effects between water table levels and cover crops were detected for any of the measured GHG fluxes. Seasonal variations of GHG fluxes were positively correlated with soil air concentrations at -15 cm and -40 cm depths, which were further regulated by dissolved organic C, nitrate concentration, and anaerobic conditions in the soil. This study suggests that there is great potential to raise water table levels and introduce green cover crops to reduce GHG emissions. Further studies are needed to achieve a complete evaluation of these strategies outside of the growing season, which may provide a significant mitigation benefit in C-rich cultivated peatlands.

AB A palaeoecological study of a subarctic minerotrophic peatland was undertaken to reconstruct the formation of the site as an archive of slope geomorphological processes. The study peatland is located about 400 m from Caribou slope (unofficial name) on Lepage Island, Lac Wiyashakimi, Nunavik (northern Quebec, Canada). The site is close to the lakeshore and receives runoff directly from Caribou slope and its catchment. Gravity processes have been active on Caribou slope since the deglaciation of the region at approximately 6000 cal. yr BP. These processes may be differentiated in terms of Holocene stages of intensity. The objective of our study was to detect evidence of gravity processes in the peatland and to note their frequency since its establishment using loss-on-ignition testing, macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating. Our results indicate that peat began to accumulate over the sandy-gravelly sediments at around 4900 cal. yr BP. Larix Laricina, Carex aquatilis and Carex rostrata were present at this time until 4660 cal. yr BP, at which point these taxa were replaced by aquatic taxa such as Hippuris vulgaris and Daphnia (aquatic invertebrates). The percentage of mineral sediments (sand) remained high during this period, which could be linked to slope activity. After 4660 cal. yr BP, sandy sediments diminished while episodes of aquatic conditions and sand inflow occurred on at least three occasions (at 4660, 3905 and 3130 cal. yr BP). The increase in water flow and the introduction of more medium to fine sand into the peatland could be linked to slope movements and the long-distance runout of debris flow that we observed in the field. Given these factors, conditions at the study site remained wet from the earliest phases until the present. Unlike the subarctic permafrost peatlands in northern Quebec, permafrost did not become established at the study site.

AB Tropical wetlands are not included in Earth system models, despite being an important source of methane (CH4) and contributing a large fraction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry in the tropics. This review identifies a remarkable lack of data on the carbon balance and gas fluxes from undisturbed tropical wetlands, which limits the ability of global change models to make accurate predictions about future climate. We show that the available data on in situ carbon gas fluxes in undisturbed forested tropical wetlands indicate marked spatial and temporal variability in CO2 and CH4 emissions, with exceptionally large fluxes in Southeast Asia and the Neotropics. By upscaling short-term measurements, we calculate that approximately 9077 Tg CH4 year(-1) and 45401480 Tg CO2 year(-1) are released from tropical wetlands globally. CH4 fluxes are greater from mineral than organic soils, whereas CO2 fluxes do not differ between soil types. The high CO2 and CH4 emissions are mirrored by high rates of net primary productivity and litter decay. Net ecosystem productivity was estimated to be greater in peat-forming wetlands than on mineral soils, but the available data are insufficient to construct reliable carbon balances or estimate gas fluxes at regional scales. We conclude that there is an urgent need for systematic data on carbon dynamics in tropical wetlands to provide a robust understanding of how they differ from well-studied northern wetlands and allow incorporation of tropical wetlands into global climate change models.

AB Two field experiments exploring plant colonization of bare peat surfaces were conducted at two adjacent peat harvesting sites in Finland, differing markedly in natural rate and pattern of revegetation and in substrate quality. The first experiment examined the effects of light NPK fertilization, liming and watering and the other the effect of tilling of the surface peat layer. The amount of vegetation established was greater in all plots at the site with higher natural rate of revegetation. Fertilization, both alone and in interaction with the site, had significant effects on the biomass and composition of the established vegetation. At both sites, the fertilized plots differed significantly from all other plots in biomass and in species composition of the established vegetation. Epilobium angustifolium was the dominant species in the fertilized plots and almost absent from the unfertilized plots. At the site with higher natural rate of revegetation, the fertilized plots also differed strikingly from the unfertilized plots in quantity of several other species. Liming had no effect on the above-ground biomass of vegetation at the site with the higher natural rate of revegetation, but had a significant effect at the other site. Light watering did not have a major effect on plant colonization at either site. In the first summer, tilling of the uppermost peat layer had no effect on the number of established plants, but at the end of the second growing season, at both sites, a significantly larger number of seedlings had established in the tilled plots.

AB Peat humification or decomposition is a frequently used proxy to extract past time changes in hydrology and climate from peat bogs. During the past century several methods to determine changes in peat decomposition have been introduced. Most of these methods are operationally defined only and the chemical changes underlying the decomposition process are often poorly understood and lack validation. Owing to the chemically undefined nature of many humification analyses the comparison of results obtained by different methods is difficult. In this study we compared changes in peat decomposition proxies in cores of two peat bogs (Konigsmoor, KK; Kleines Rotes Bruch, KRB) from the Harz Mountains (Germany) using C/N ratios, Fourier transform infrared spectra absorption (FTIR) intensities, Rock Eval (R) oxygen and hydrogen indices, delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic signatures and UV-absorption (UV-ABS) of NaOH peat extracts. In order to explain parallels and discrepancies between these methods, one of the cores was additionally analysed by pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC-MS). Pyrolysis-GC-MS data provide detailed information on a molecular level, which allows differentiation of both changes attributed to decomposition processes and changes in vegetation. Principal component analysis was used to identify and separate the effects of changes in vegetation pattern and decomposition processes because both may occur simultaneously upon changes in bog hydrology. Records of decomposition proxies show similar historical development at both sites, indicating external forcing such as climate as controlling the process. All decomposition proxies except UV-ABS and delta N-15 isotopes show similar patterns in their records and reflect to different extents signals of decomposition. The molecular composition of the KK core reveals that these changes are mainly attributed to decomposition processes and to a lesser extent to changes in vegetation. Changes in the molecular composition indicate that peat decomposition in the KK bog is mainly characterized by preferential decomposition of phenols and polysaccharides and relative enrichment of aliphatics during drier periods. Enrichment of lignin and other aromatics during decomposition was also observed but showed less variation than polysaccharides or aliphatics, and presumably reflects changes in vegetation associated with changes in hydrology of the bogs. Significant correlations with polysaccharide and aliphatic pyrolysis products were found for C/N ratios, FTIR-band intensities and for hydrogen index values, supporting that these decomposition indices provide reasonable information. Correlations of polysaccharide and aliphatic pyrolysis products with oxygen index values and delta C-13 was weaker, assumingly indicating carboxylation of the peat during drier periods and enrichment of isotopically lighter peat components during decomposition, respectively. FTIR, C/N ratio, pyrolysis-GC-MS analyses and Rock Eval hydrogen indices appear to reflect mass loss and related changes in the molecular peat composition during mineralization best. Pyrolysis-GC-MS allows disentangling the decomposition processes and vegetation changes. UV-ABS measurements of alkaline peat extracts show only weak correlation with other decomposition proxies and pyrolysis results as they mainly reflect the formation of humic acids through humification and to a lesser extent mass loss during mineralization.

AB Prior research has demonstrated the importance of water limitations and increasing temperatures on upland black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) tree growth, which is a dominant component of the North American boreal forest. However, little work has been done to investigate the connectivity between growth and hydro-climate in peatland black spruce systems. The boreal forest is the largest global terrestrial biome and is highly threatened due to current and projected increases in temperatures for the northern latitudes. Here we explore the dynamics among annual black spruce growth, climate, and water table elevations using 45 years of in situ precipitation, temperature, and water table elevation coupled with dendrochronological analysis from six research peatlands at the Marcell Experimental Forest, MN, USA. From 1963 to 2010, we found weak relationships between water table elevation and black spruce growth at the six study sites. Instead, annual black spruce growth was most favourable during three climatic periods: (a) cool, moist conditions in mid-summer; (b) warm mid-spring temperatures; and (c) cool temperatures in the fall prior to the current growing season. The disconnect between black spruce growth and water table dynamics was surprising and suggests that either annual black spruce growth is minimally responsive to hydrological fluctuations at the timescale we analysed or there is great elasticity of black spruce growth to peatland water table and evapotranspiration dynamics under the range of hydrological fluctuations contained in our record.

AB Although satellite imagery is becoming a basic component of the work of ecologists and conservationists, its potential and reliability are still relatively unknown for a large number of ecosystems. Using Landsat 7/ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) data, we tested the accuracy of two types of supervised classifications for mapping 13 peatland habitats in southern Quebec, Canada. Before classifying peatland habitats, we applied a mask procedure that revealed 629 peatlands covering a total of 18,103 ha; 26% of them were larger than 20 ha. We applied both a simple maximum likelihood (ML) function and a weighted maximum likelihood (WML) function that took into account the proportion of each habitat class within each peatland when classifying the habitats on the image. By validating 626 Global Positioning System locations within 92 peatlands, we showed that both classification procedures provided an accurate representation of the 13 peatland habitat classes. For all habitat classes except lawn with pools, the predominant classified habitat within 45 in of the center of the validation location was of the same type as the one observed in the field. There were differences in the performance of the two classification procedures: ML was a better tool for mapping rare habitats, whereas WML favored the most common habitats. Based on ordinations, peatland habitat classes were as effective as environmental variables such as humidity indicators and water chemistry components at explaining the distribution of plant species and performed 1.6 times better when it came to accounting for vegetation structure patterns. Peatland habitats with pools had the most distinct plant assemblages, and the habitats dominated by herbs were moderately distinct from those characterized by ericaceous shrubs. Habitats dominated by herbs were the most variable in terms of plant species assemblages. Because peatlands are economically valuable wetlands, the maps resulting from the new classification procedure presented here will provide useful information for land managers and conservationists.

AB In recent decades, sulfate concentrations in many European freshwater wetlands have increased by 10-fold or more, due mainly to the use of sulfate-polluted river water to compensate for water shortage in these areas. To test the effect of surf ate enrichment a mesocosm experiment was set up, using waterlogged soil cores, intact with vegetation, from a mesotrophic fen meadow. During sulfate addition at environmentally relevant levels (0, 2, and 4 mmol L-1), phosphate concentration and alkalinity of the pore water rapidly rose due to increased sulfate reduction rates. Free sulfide accumulated to levels toxic to several wetland plant species and biomass regrowth after harvesting was significantly lower on treated soils, especially for Carer species. Eventually, the concentrations of ammonium, phosphate, and potassium increased strongly in the treated soils due to reduced uptake by plants and extra mineralization. Sulfate availability was rate limiting, until the supply of readily decomposable organic matter became limited. It is argued that the Significance of the observed changes in free sulfide concentrations and in the rate of nutrient mobilization should be recognized, and that these effects can be as important as direct eutrophication caused by the import of nutrients. The reported changes may severely influence the plant species composition of freshwater wetlands.

AB Moss tundra that accumulates a thick peat layer is one of the most important ecosystems in the High Arctic, Svalbard. The importance of this ecosystem for carbon sequestration was estimated from the apparent rates of carbon accumulation based on the C-14 age and amount of peat in the active layer. The study site at Stuphallet, Brogger Peninsula, northwestern Svalbard was covered with a thick peat layer dominated by moss species such as Calliergon richardsonii, Paludella squarrosa, Tomenthypnum nitens, and Warnstorfia exannulata. The average thickness of the active layer (brown moss and peat) was approximately 28 cm in 1 August 2011. The calibrated (cal) age of peat from the bottom of the active layer (20-30 cm below the peatland surface) ranged from 81 to 701 cal yr BP (median value of 2s range). Based on the total carbon (4.5-9.2 kg C m(-2)), the apparent rate of carbon accumulation in the active layer was 9.0-19.2 (g C m(-2) yr(-1)), which is similar to or greater than the net ecosystem production or net primary production reported for other vegetation types in this area. Our data suggest that moss tundra plays an important role in carbon sequestration in this area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

AB Here we investigate the response of soils and litter to 5 years of experimental additions of ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and ammonia (NH3) to an ombrotrophic peatland. We test the importance of direct (via soil) and indirect (via litter) effects on phosphatase activity and efflux of CO2. We also determined how species representing different functional types responded to the nitrogen treatments. Our results demonstrate that additions of NO3, NH4 and NH3 all stimulated phosphatase activity but the effects were dependent on species of litter and mechanism (direct or indirect). Deposition of NH3 had no effect on efflux of CO2 from Calluna vulgaris litter, despite it showing signs of stress in the field, whereas both NO3 and NH4 reduced CO2 fluxes. Our results show that the collective impacts on peatlands of the three principal forms of nitrogen in atmospheric deposition are a result of differential effects and mechanisms on individual components.

AB Fertilization of drained peatland forests with easily soluble or slow-release apatite fertilizers can increase phosphorus (P) export to water courses, especially when the soil is low in aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) hydroxides and oxides. Application of Al and Fe together with P increases P adsorption to the soil and decreases the risk of leaching. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of recycled iron phosphate (rFePO(4)) as forest fertilizer raw material from environmental and forest production perspectives. Trial fertilizers with different mixtures of rFePO(4) and Russian Kola apatite (Kap) were applied on 15 mini-catchments (area 100 m(2)), where the discharge at the outlet was collected, sampled and analyzed throughout the about 4-year measurement period. The foliage P content and height growth of the trees on the mini-catchments were measured. The biomass growth of the extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia (EMM) was studied with a separate in-growth mesh bag experiment conducted on the same site. The results indicated no increase in phosphorus export to surface waters after application of rFePO(4) and 25/75 and 50/50 mixtures of rFePO(4) and Kap. In contrast to earlier studies showing a relatively high P export with different types of apatite fertilizers, the Kap fertilizer showed only minor phosphorus export. The height growth measurements and needle analyses of the juvenile Scots pine stands indicated poor P availability from pure rFePO(4), but the P availability from the 50/50 and 25/75 mixtures of rFePO(4) and Kap was similar to pure Kap. The mixtures of Kap and rFePO(4) enhanced the EMM biomass by 2- to 3-fold, whereas Kap and rFePO(4) alone, and high P availability (superphosphate) had no significant effect compared to non-P controls. The increase in EMM biomass as induced by concurrent application of Kap and rFePO(4) was not clearly reflected in tree growth and P acquisition. However, longer follow-up studies than in this one may be needed in order to verify the effect of increased EMM biomass on mycorrhizal mycelia mediated nutrient uptake and tree growth.

AB Most studies of soil/atmosphere greenhouse gas exchange in Arctic and Sub-Arctic wetlands have been conducted by the use of small scale chamber techniques during the growing season. To improve the knowledge about the processes in the transition period from winter to growth season, an experiment is presented here showing measurements of CH4, CO2 and H2O using both chambers (only CH4) and eddy correlation technique from the thaw period in early spring and during mid summer. The emphasis is on a comparison between eddy correlation and chamber measurements of methane fluxes during spring thawing in a subarctic mire near Abisko, northern Sweden. Methane exchange as measured by the two techniques is compared and evaluated in relation to temperature variations and atmospheric conductance. During the thaw period, integrated daily net fluxes of CH, flux showed emission rates increasing from 2.6 mg m(-2) d(-1) to 22.5 mg m(-2) d(-1) within four days; the later rate corresponding to approximately 25% of the mid-summer flux. A profound diurnal cycle was observed in the release of methane, emphasising the importance of continuous measurements when calculating integrated fluxes.

AB Often referred to as the "Third Pole,"China's Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau developed large amounts of peatland owing to its unique alpine environment. As a renewable resource, peat helps to regulate the climate as well as performing other important functions. However, in recent years, intensifying climate change and anthropogenic disturbances have resulted in peatland degradation and consequently made sustainable development of peatland more difficult. This review summarizes peatland ecological and economic functions, including carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, energy supplies, and ecotourism. It identifies climate change and anthropogenic disturbances as the two key factors attributing to peatland degradation and ecosystem carbon loss. Current problems in environmental degradation and future challenges in peatland management under the effects of global warming are also discussed and highlighted.

AB A multiple substrate induced respiration (SIR) assay, using C-14-labelled carbon sources, was used to evaluate community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of the microbial community in peat horizons of differing degrees of humification. The separation and grouping of the peat horizons by CLPP was similar to the pattern produced by analysis of the organic carbon chemistry of the peat horizons by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and therefore reflected the level of decomposition. Partial redundancy analysis showed that a large proportion (68.7%) of the variability in the CLPP data could be attributed to the ratio of polysaccharide to 'carboxylate' FTIR bands alone. The multiple substrate SIR technique may, therefore, be a powerful technique to further elucidate the influence of the microbial constituent of peat on the potential activity and patterns of cycling of labile carbon in peatlands.

TI SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF METHANE FLUX FROM SUBARCTIC/NORTHERN
   BOREAL FENS
SO GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
LA English
DT Article
AB Emissions of CH4 were measured by a static chamber technique (five chambers/site) at 23 sites in four fens near Schefferville, subarctic Quebec. At three intensively-monitored sites along a transect from fen margin to central and flooded sites, mean CH4 fluxes from June to August, 1989 were 65, 125, and 36 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Pore water CH4 concentrations in the peat profiles to a depth of l m averaged 125 to 200 M, with lower concentrations (generally <50 M) at 0.1 m. Total, depth-integrated storage of CH4 in the peat profiles ranged from 3.5 to 4.3 g m(-2). Although CH4 flux was only weakly correlated with either peat temperature at 0.1 m or water table position within each site, there was a strong association of flux and these variables among the three sites, indicating the value of ecological attributes in identifying patterns of CH4 flux. A pulse of CH4 was recorded at two of the three sites in mid-August, associated with a degassing of the peat profile, based on pore water CH4 concentrations. This pulse appeared to be initiated by the lowering of the water table by between 5 and 10 cm during a 3-week period of low rainfall and is estimated to have contributed 18 to 65% of the seasonal CH4 emission, depending on the location of the site. An estimate of the regional CH4 flux from 130 km(2) of the Schefferville area was based on CH4 flux measurements at 23 sites in the area, stratified by fen type (forested margin, margin, central, flooded, ridge, and pool). June to August regional CH4 flux was 18 mg m(-2) d(-1), for an area in which fen coverage was 29%. When extrapolated to the global scale, these results indicate that northern fens may contribute about 14 Tg yr(-1), somewhat lower than other recent estimates.

AB The chronologies of five northern European ombrotrophic peat bogs subjected to a large ANIS C-14 dating effort (32-44 dates/site) are presented here. The results of Bayesian calibration (BCal) of dates with a prior assumption of chronological ordering were compared with a Bayesian wiggle-match approach (Bpeat) which assumes constant linear accumulation over sections of the peat profile. Interpolation of BCal age estimates of dense sequences of C-14 dates showed variable patterns of peat accumulation with time, with changes in accumulation occurring at intervals ranging from 20 to 50 cm. Within these intervals, peat accumulation appeared to be relatively linear. Close analysis suggests that some of the inferred variations in accumulation rate were related to the plant macrofossil composition of the peat. The wiggle-matched age-depth models had relatively high chronological uncertainty within intervals of closely spaced 14 C dates, suggesting that the premise of constant linear accumulation over large sections of the peat profile is unrealistic. Age models based on the assumption of linear accumulation over large parts of a peat core (and therefore only effective over millennial timescales), are not compatible with studies examining environmental change during the Holocene, where variability often occurs at decadal to centennial time-scales. Ideally, future wiggle-match age models should be constrained, with boundaries between sections based on the plant macrofossil composition of the peat and physical-chemical parameters such as the degree of decomposition. Strategies for the selection of material for dating should be designed so that there should be enough C-14 dates to accurately reconstruct the peat accumulation rate of each homogeneous stratigraphic unit.

SO FORESTRY
LA English

ID CONIFER PLANTATIONS; PEAT; PEATLANDS; PLOTS
AB This study was established to investigate the effects of blanket bug afforestation on the physical properties of the peat and on the quantity and timing of runoff. Three afforestation treatments, representing the options for planting on very deep blanket bog, were used: Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), given phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizers at planting, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), given no fertilizer until P was needed to relieve deficiency in year 3, and a 50:50 mixture of the two species, given P at planting. Afforestation treatments reduced annual runoff by 7 per cent compared with an unploughed, unplanted but drained control. Runoff was reduced in spring and summer but not in autumn or winter. Compared with the drained control, peak flows were increased by afforestation while the baseflow component of total flow was reduced. Sediment accumulated at a similar rate (0.016 kg dry matter per metre of drain per year) in the afforested treatments and the drained control. Afforestation lowered the water table significantly compared with the control, but there were no differences among the three treatments. Feat water content was reduced within 4 weeks by the ploughing operation that preceded planting in the afforestation treatments. In the first 5 years the undisturbed ground between plough ridges subsided by 11 (+/-2) cm while the tops of ridges and the bottoms of furrows subsided by 18 (+/-2) cm and 5 (+/-1) cm, respectively. Subsidence increased with proximity to a drain, from 9 (+/-1) cm, 10 m from the drain edge, to 16 (+/-2) cm, 0.1 m from the drain edge. Even in the control treatment, the perimeter drain caused a subsidence of 2 (+/-1) cm 10 m away, and 11 (+/-5) cm 0.1 m from the edge. The rate of subsidence slowed down with time and, after the third year, further subsidence only occurred in summer. Feat depth markers showed that subsidence of the ground surface was caused by consolidation of peat throughout its thickness, rather than solely by shrinkage of the drained layer. Half of the subsidence near the centre of the afforested plots was caused by compression of peat at depths of over 1.5 m. Drainage system design and maintenance needs to take account of the differential subsidence beneath planted and unplanted ground. Where drains run from planted onto unplanted ground they need to be deep enough to allow for a 0.6 degrees reduction in gradient in the first 5 years, increasing to 1 degrees or more subsequently. When considering pre-commercial felling to restore peatland habitats, areas of pre-thicket age first rotation forest can be considered candidates because, at this stage, the peat has not been altered to a degree which would hinder rewetting and consequent habitat development.

(The Holocene 19 (2009) 1093-1094, this issue) on our paper (Mccslymont et al., The Holocene 18 (2008) 991-1002) and the opportunity to discuss further the complexities that surround the disappearance of Sphagnum imbricatum from Butterburn Flow P our study), and the implications for understanding the disappearance of this species in northwest Europe. We also wish to clarify our site of study; we presented data only from Butterburn Flow, northern England. Although we note that the disappearance of S. imbricatum here is part of a wider European decline in the late Holocene, we did not present data from Wales or Ireland as suggested in the opening paragraph of Robroek's comment. We also noted that the replacement of S. imbricatum by S. magellanicum occurred over c. 44 years, but proposed that it may have been longer owing to evidence for reduced peat accumulation across the transition.

AB The eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) is rare throughout much of its range, especially where this species is associated with weakly minerotrophic peatlands. Because such habitats can rapidly become unsuitable through succession, we established experimental plots to evaluate the effects of cutting, burning, herbivore exclusion following cutting and burning, and herbicide application on eastern massasauga habitat. After the first growing season, shrub density, shrub basal area, and shrub height were greater (P = 0.008) in cut-only (GO) areas than in areas that were cut-and-burned (CB). After 3 years, only shrub height continued to be greater in CO areas (P = 0.001). Both basal area and shrub height increased in both treatments at the same rate, while the shrub mountain-holly (Nemopanthus mucronata) became less important in the plots over time; however, this species still maintained the highest importance value (IV) over the 3-year study period. We conducted a second experiment to evaluate browsing by mammals and found shrub height increased in all treatment types over the 2 years monitored (P = 0.009) and, at the end of the first year, was consistently greater in CO plots (P = 0.001). At the end of the second year, this relation held only in fenced compared to unfenced plots, indicating that browsing had a significant effect on growth in shrub height. The herbicide glyphosate was very effective when applied as a broadcast foliar spray. Abundance and diversity of small mammals in the shrub peatland were lower than in surrounding forested wetland habitat. Over the 3-year monitoring period, abundance and diversity of small mammals increased in the treated areas of the shrub peatland; however, it is unclear if this increase was a permanent or a transitory effect. Data on eastern massasauga use of these cleared areas were inconclusive; however 9 of 89 (10.1%) aboveground radiolocations from 9 individual snakes tracked in 1991 occurred in or around treatment areas that constituted only 2.5% of the total peatland area.

AB Wetlands are the largest natural sources for atmospheric methane (CH4). In wetlands with permanent shallow inundation, the seasonal variation of CH4 exchange is mainly controlled by temperature and phenology. In addition, ecosystem CH4 exchange varies considerably on smaller temporal scales such as days or weeks. Several single processes that control CH4 emissions on the local soil-plant-atmosphere continuum are well investigated, but their interaction on ecosystem level is not well understood yet. We applied wavelet analysis to a quasi-continuous eddy covariance CH4 flux time series to describe the temporal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange within the growing season of a permanently inundated temperate fen. Moreover, we addressed time scale-specific controls and investigated whether their impact changes during the course of the growing season.
   On large time scales of two weeks to three months, temperature explained most of the variation in ecosystem CH4 exchange. In general, the temperature in the shallow water column had the largest impact as explanatory variable, however, air temperature and soil temperature became increasingly important as explanatory variables when water level dropped slightly up to June. The diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange shifted during the course of the growing season: During a short time period at the end of April, plant activity (expressed by canopy photosynthesis) caused a diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange with peak time around noon. In the following weeks, the daily cycle of convective mixing within the water column (expressed by the water temperature gradient) gradually gained importance and caused high night-time CH4 emissions, thereby levelling off the diurnal CH4 emission pattern. Moreover, shear-induced turbulence caused short-term fluctuations of ecosystem CH4 exchange on time scales up to two hours.
   Our study highlights the need for multi-scale approaches that consider the non-stationarity of the underlying processes to adequately describe the complexity of ecosystem CH4 exchange. Moreover, we show that CH4 release processes such as convective mixing of the water column which have been mainly considered for aquatic ecosystems (see recent exceptions in Godwin et al., 2013; Poindexter and Variano, 2013) might also be of importance in shallowly flooded terrestrial ecosystems.

AB The composition and distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were studied in organomineral and organic soils of the Meshchera National Park. It was found that the background oligotrophic peat soils unaffected by fires in central parts of the bogs are characterized by the increased PAH concentrations due to their high sorption capacity. The fires of 2007 and 2010 resulted in the transformation of the plant cover and soil morphology, the formation of new horizons, and the change in the PAHs content and composition. Significant burn-off of organic matter was found in oligotrophic-eutrophic soils and resulted in the decrease of PAHs content after fire. Only partial burn-off of organic horizons and intense formation of PAHs were recorded in the soil with initially great thickness of peat horizons. Pyrogenic accumulation of PAHs was identified in organomineral soils of the marginal parts of bogs and of forest sites.

AB AimsWe study the high-mountain grasslands growing on siliceous substrata of the Iberian Peninsula to determine floristic patterns and affinities that best define the structure and phytosociological classification of this vegetation.
   LocationCantabrian Range, Sierra Nevada, Sistema Central, Sistema Iberico and the Pyrenees.
   MethodsWe analysed 1484 releves representing 25 phytosociological associations of high-mountain grasslands on siliceous substrata previously described in the study area. A first classification using noise clustering produced a large noise group containing over 50% of the releves. We then carried out a DCA to check the relative position of the noise group components with respect to the whole pool, and a K-means combined with species indicator analysis to obtain a more precise delimitation of clusters through their representative species.
   ResultsWe considered 17 groups as the optimum number of clusters when considering K-means and the corresponding indicator species. Pyrenean alpine vegetation separated first, showing a homogeneous pattern with a set of diagnostic taxa organized around two groups that coincide with one European class (Juncetea trifidi) and two alliances: Festucion eskiae in chionophilous environments and Festucion supinae in chionophobous habitats. The rest of the data correspond to the Iberian class Festucetea indigestae, recognized in three alliances corresponding to three territories: the Cantabrian Range, Central Iberian Peninsula (Sistema Central and Sistema Iberico) and Sierra Nevada. Four groups were extracted from the Cantabrian Range, which correspond to temperate (two groups) and Mediterranean (two groups) plant communities included in Teesdaliopsio-Luzulion. Two groups from Sierra Nevada - one oro- (Thymion serpylloidis) and another cryoromediterranean (Ptilotrichion purpurei) - were separated later on. Some relationships were found between the oromediterranean communities in the Central Mountains (Sierra de Guadarrama) and Sierra Nevada. This highlights the mediterranean character of this central Iberian mountain, compared to the rest of the central ranges (four groups representing cryoromediterranean vegetation) that were independently separated by the analysis and have a more submediterranean character. All are included in Jasionion carpetanae.
   ConclusionsThe Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Range show relationships in high-mountain vegetation but also differences since the Cantabrian Range has a major influence of Mediterranean taxa in their plant communities. Central Iberian mountains showed relationships with the other Mediterranean mountains through the presence of species of the Festuca indigesta gr. and other endemic taxa. The particular pattern of Sierra Nevada - very patchy and with lower cover values - hindered the separation of groups, but two groups were finally detected in the analysis based on the altitudinal gradient.

AB Goal-To establish regularity of transformation of drained peat bog soils, also changes in the water duty to floodplains in the process of agricultural use. Determine the ways of their rational use in the conditions of the Left-Bank Forest-Steppe.
   Research methods. General scientific and special, empirical and theoretical, historical - for a retrospective synthesis of scientific achievements of domestic and foreign scientists on the study of the formation of indicators of fertility and productivity of drained soils; analytical - for analysis of conditions and processes of changing fertility indicators; laboratory - for determination of agrochemical and water-physical properties of soil; field - to establish the botanical composition of the grass stand, accumulation of the amount of root and crop residues in the soil, to establish the intensity of mineralization of organic matter and crop productivity; mathematical statistics - to assess the reliability of the research results.
   Many years of experience summarized and scientific estimates of the transformation of drained peat bog soils with long-term agricultural use are presented. It has been established that over 80 years of use of these soils in agricultural production, peat deposits wear amounted to 100 cm (in the early years, an annual decrease in peat depth was 1, 63, subsequent - 1, 45, and the last - 0, 88 cm). Decrease the depth of the peat bed also occurs due to their compaction.
   Qualitative and quantitative changes in peat soils under the influence of drainage and long-term agricultural use we researched. We have established the patterns and directions of soil processes depending on the influence of the duration of development of peat soils. We also identified scientific and methodological approaches to assessing the conditions and factors affecting the formation of fertility and productivity of drained soils. We have analyzed existing approaches to rationalizing nature management, taking into account the characteristics of the economic development of drained lands.
   Regularities and directions of transformation of drained peat bog soils under the influence of long-term agricultural use are justified. We have identified trends in the indicators of fertility and productivity of drained peat bog soils. We have implemented a systematic approach to the spatiotemporal study of the soil potential of drained soils in order to rationalize nature management in the risky farming zone. We also found that the high-productivity use of organogenic soils provides for the functioning of agrophytocenoses from perennial crops with the aim of creating conservation agrolandscapes and improving the ecological balance in the floodplains of small rivers.

AB Using a 50-year-old field experiment, we investigated the effects of the long-term land management practices of repeated burning and grazing on peatland vegetation and carbon dynamics (C). Plant community composition, C stocks in soils and vegetation, and C fluxes of CO2, CH4 and DOC, were measured over an 18-month period. We found that both burning and grazing reduced aboveground C stocks, and that burning reduced C stocks in the surface peat. Both burning and grazing strongly affected vegetation community composition, causing an increase in graminoids and a decrease in ericoid subshrubs and bryophytes relative to unburned and ungrazed controls; this effect was especially pronounced in burned treatments. Soil microbial properties were unaffected by grazing and showed minor responses to burning, in that the C:N ratio of the microbial biomass increased in burned relative to unburned treatments. Increases in the gross ecosystem CO2 fluxes of respiration and photosynthesis were observed in burned and grazed treatments relative to controls. Here, the greatest effects were seen in the burning treatment, where the mean increase in gross fluxes over the experimental period was greater than 40%. Increases in gross CO2 fluxes were greatest during the summer months, suggesting an interactive effect of land use and climate on ecosystem C cycling. Collectively, our results indicate that long-term management of peatland has marked effects on ecosystem C dynamics and CO2 flux, which are primarily related to changes in vegetation community structure.

AB Commercial potting media often contain substantial amounts of peat that was mined from endangered bog and fen ecosystems. The main objectives of this study were to assess (1) whether the amendment of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% (v/v) of vermicompost (VC) to a fertilized commercial peat potting substrate has effects on the emergence, growth and biomass allocation of tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) under greenhouse conditions, (2) whether possible impacts on seedlings can affect tomato yields and fruit quality even when transplanted into equally fertilized field soil, and (3) whether effects are consistent among different tomato varieties. Amended VC was produced in a windrow system of food and cotton waste mainly by earthworms Eisenia fetida Sav. Vermicompost amendments significantly influenced, specifically for each tomato variety, emergence and elongation of seedlings. Biomass allocation (root:shoot ratio) was affected by VC amendments for two varieties in seedling stage and one field-grown tomato variety. Marketable and total yields of field tomatoes were not affected by VC amendments used for seedling husbandry. However, morphological (circumference, dry matter content, peel firmness) and chemical fruit parameters (contents of C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, L-ascorbic acid, glucose, fructose) were significantly affected by VC amendments in seedling substrates; these effects again were specific for each tomato variety. Overall, vermicompost could be an environmentally friendly substitute for peat in potting media with similar or beneficial effects on seedling performance and fruit quality. However, at least for tomatoes, variety-specific responses should be considered when giving recommendations on the optimum proportion of vermicompost amendment to horticultural potting substrate.

AB Ice-wedge polygon peatlands contain a substantial part of the carbon stored in permafrost soils. However, little is known about their long-term carbon accumulation rates (CAR) in relation to shifts in vegetation and climate. We collected four peat profiles from one single polygon in NE Yakutia and cut them into contiguous 0.5cm slices. Pollen density interpolation between AMS C-14 dated levels provided the time span contained in each of the sample slices, which - in combination with the volumetric carbon content - allowed for the reconstruction of CAR over decadal and centennial timescales. Vegetation representing dry palaeo-ridges and wet depressions was reconstructed with detailed micro- and macrofossil analysis. We found repeated shifts between wet and dry conditions during the past millennium. Dry ridges with associated permafrost growth originated during phases of (relatively) warm summer temperature and collapsed during relatively cold phases, illustrating the important role of vegetation and peat as intermediaries between ambient air temperature and the permafrost. The average long-term CAR across the four profiles was 10.6 +/- 5.5g Cm(-2)yr(-1). Time-weighted mean CAR did not differ significantly between wet depression and dry ridge/hummock phases (10.6 +/- 5.2g Cm(-2)yr(-1) and 10.3 +/- 5.7g Cm(-2)yr(-1), respectively). Although we observed increased CAR in relation to warm shifts, we also found changes in the opposite direction and the highest CAR actually occurred during the Little Ice Age. In fact, CAR rather seems to be governed by strong internal feedback mechanisms and has roughly remained stable on centennial time scales. The absence of significant differences in CAR between dry ridge and wet depression phases suggests that recent warming and associated expansion of shrubs will not affect long-term rates of carbon burial in ice-wedge polygon peatlands.

AB The extent of peat decomposition was investigated in four cores collected along a latitudinal gradient from 56 degrees N to 66 degrees N in the West Siberian Lowland. The acid:aldehyde ratios of lignin phenols were significantly higher in the two northern cores compared with the two southern cores, indicating peats at the northern sites were more highly decomposed. Yields of hydroxyproline, an amino acid found in plant structural glycoproteins, were also significantly higher in northern cores compared with southern cores. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins are not synthesized by microbes and are generally less reactive than bulk plant carbon, so elevated yields indicated that northern cores were more extensively decomposed than the southern cores. The southern cores experienced warmer temperatures, but were less decomposed, indicating that temperature was not the primary control of peat decomposition. The plant community oscillated between Sphagnum and vascular plant dominance in the southern cores, but vegetation type did not appear to affect the extent of decomposition. Oxygen exposure time appeared to be the strongest control of the extent of peat decomposition. The northern cores had lower accumulation rates and drier conditions, so these peats were exposed to oxic conditions for a longer time before burial in the catotelm, where anoxic conditions prevail and rates of decomposition are generally lower by an order of magnitude.

AB Accurate dating of peat accumulation is essential for quantitatively reconstructing past changes in atmospheric metal deposition and carbon burial. By analyzing fallout radionuclides Pb-210, Cs-137, Am-241, and Be-7, and total Pb and Hg in 5 cores from two Swedish peatlands we addressed the consequence of estimating accumulation rates due to downwashing of atmospherically supplied elements within peat. The detection of Be-7 down to 18-20 cm for some cores, and the broad vertical distribution of Am-241 without a well-defined peak, suggest some downward transport by percolating rainwater and smearing of atmospherically deposited elements in the uppermost peat layers. Application of the CRS age-depth model leads to unrealistic peat mass accumulation rates (400-600 g m(-2) yr(-1)), and inaccurate estimates of past Pb and Hg deposition rates and trends, based on comparisons to deposition monitoring data (forest moss biomonitoring and wet deposition). After applying a newly proposed IP-CRS model that assumes a potential downward transport of Pb-210 through the uppermost peat layers, recent peat accumulation rates (200-300 g m(-2) yr(-1)) comparable to published values were obtained. Furthermore, the rates and temporal trends in Pb and Hg accumulation correspond more closely to monitoring data, although some off-set is still evident. We suggest that downwashing can be successfully traced using Be-7, and if this information is incorporated into age-depth models, better calibration of peat records with monitoring data and better quantitative estimates of peat accumulation and past deposition are possible, although more work is needed to characterize how downwashing may vary between seasons or years.

AB Ecosystem modelling is a useful tool for gaining insight and quantifying the carbon exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. This study examines how well Forest-DNDC (a process-based biogeochemical model for forests/wetlands) estimates carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from Canadian boreal forests and peatlands. We also evaluate the appropriateness in using Forest-DNDC to establish the baseline conditions of CO2 fluxes before land-use change. Two mature black spruce forests and two ombrotrophic bogs were selected for comparisons between modelled and measured CO2 fluxes. Two vegetation parameters in Forest-DNDC were optimized, and a hydrologic parameter was calibrated for the CO2 flux simulations. The daily GPP (gross primary production) and ER (ecosystem respiration) simulations from all the study sites were in close agreement with the observations (r(2) for GPP and ER equal 0.79-0.86 and 0.86-0.87, respectively). The results of this study show that Forest-DNDC is useful in establishing baseline exchanges for boreal ecosystems prior to land-use change.

AB The cyclic succession of brown coals in the Latrobe Valley, Gippsland Basin, Australia, records an exceptional floral and charcoal record from the Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene. New palynological, geological and charcoal data are consistent with existing colourimetry, carbon isotope, and organic geochemical and palaeobotanical data, indicating that the repeated lithotype cycles represent relative drying (terrestrialization). Based on this detailed palynological study, the vegetation succession within the Latrobe Valley peatlands is interpreted to have begun with a fire-prone emergent marsh of bulrushes (Typhaceae), which grades landward into a fire-prone meadow marsh of rushes (Restionaceae), heaths (Ericaceae) and coral-ferns (Gleicheniaceae). This marsh environment then developed into a forested bog, with gymnosperms (e.g. the Podocarpaceae Dacrycarpus and Dacrydium) as the dominant trees, until an ombrogenous forest bog developed, predominantly consisting of angiosperms (e.g. Nothofagus, Quintinia).
   The similarity between vegetation successions in New Zealand and the lightening-upwards cycles from the Latrobe Valley coals suggests that New Zealand's modern vegetation communities represent a floral analogue for the successions preserved in the Latrobe Valley coals. High abundances of micro and macro charcoal recorded in the darker lithotypes, within the lithotype cycles of the M1B and M2A seams, suggest that the Latrobe Valley peatlands were subject to repeated fires during the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene.

AB The morphology and properties of the soils of permafrost peatlands in the southeast of the Bol'shezemel'skaya tundra are characterized. The soils developing in the areas of barren peat circles differ from oligotrophic permafrost-affected peat soils (Cryic Histosols) of vegetated peat mounds in a number of morphological and physicochemical parameters. The soils of barren circles are characterized by the wellstructured surface horizons, relatively low exchangeable acidity, and higher rates of decomposition and humification of organic matter. It is shown that the development of barren peat circles on tops of peat mounds is favored by the activation of erosional and cryogenic processes in the topsoil. The role of winter wind erosion in the destruction of the upper peat and litter horizons is demonstrated. A comparative analysis of the temperature regime of soils of vegetated peat mounds and barren peat circles is presented. The soil-geocryological complex of peat mounds is a system consisting of three major layers: seasonally thawing layer-upper permafrost-underlying permafrost. The upper permafrost horizons of peat mounds at the depth of 50-90 cm are morphologically similar to the underlying permafrost. However, these layers differ in their physicochemical properties, especially in the composition and properties of their organic matter.

AB The function of peatlands as a large carbon (C) reservoir results from the net C uptake under cold, wet, and acid environments. However, in the context of global warming, the balance between C input and release is expected to change, which may further alter the C sink of peatlands. To examine the response to climate warming of a temperate Sphagnum peatland which has been invaded by vascular plants, a mesocosm experiment was conducted with open top chambers (OTCs) to simulate a moderate temperature increase. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and methane (CH4) emissions were monitored for 2 years. The CO2 and CH4 fluxes were modeled by relating to abiotic and biotic factors, including temperature, water table depth (WTD), and vegetation, in order to calculate the annual C budget. Results showed that the annual cumulated GPP was significantly enhanced by the simulated warming (-602 compared to -501 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in OTC and control plots, respectively), mainly due to the increase of graminoid biomass by warming, while experimental warming had no significant effect on the annual ER and CH4 emissions (an output of 615 and 500 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for ER; 21 and 16 gC m(-2) yr(-1) for CH4 emissions in OTC and control plots, respectively). The annual NEE and C budget were not affected by the short-term experimental warming. The mesocosms under both treatments acted as a gaseous C source with 34 and 14 gC m(-2) yr(-1) output under OTC and control treatment, respectively. This C source was driven by the strong net carbon dioxide (CO2) release during a low WTD period in summer, as CH4 emissions only accounted for 0.9-2.2% of the total C fluxes. Our study identified the effect of moderate warming on the C fluxes, even on a short-term basis. Also, our findings highlighted that the response of C fluxes to warming largely depends on the WTD and vegetation composition. Thus, long-term monitoring of hydrology and vegetation change under climate warming is essential to examine their interactions in determining the C fluxes in peatlands.

AB Significant volumes of terrigenous organic matter can be preserved to form coals only when and where the overall increase in accommodation approximately equals the production rate of peat, Accommodation is a function of subsidence and base level, For mires, base level is very specifically the groundwater table, In paralic settings, the groundwater table is strongly controlled by sea level and the precipitation/evaporation ratio. Feat accumulates over a range of rates, but always with a definite maximum rate set by original organic productivity and space available below depositional base level (groundwater table).
   Below a threshold accommodation rate (nonzero), no continuous peats accumulate, due to falling or low groundwater table, sedimentary bypass, and extensive erosion by fluvial channels. This is typical of upper highstand, lowstand fan, and basal lowstand-wedge systems tracts. Higher accommodation rates provide relatively stable conditions with rising groundwater tables. Mires initiate and thrive, quickly filling local accommodation vertically and expanding laterally, favoring accumulation of laterally continuous coals in paralic zones within both middle lowstand and middle highstand systems tracts, If the accommodation increase balances or slightly exceeds organic productivity, mires accumulate peat vertically, yielding thicker, more isolated coals most likely during of late lowstand-early transgressive and late transgressive-early highstand periods, At very large accommodation increases, mires are stressed and eventually inundated by clastics or standing water (as in middle transgressive systems tracts),
   These relations should be valid for mires in all settings, including alluvial, lake plain, and paralic, The tie to sea level in paralic zones depends on local subsidence, sediment supply, and groundwater regimes, These concepts are also useful for investigating the distribution of seal and reservoir facies in nonmarine settings.

Among different methods of estimation of this exchange, the eddy-covariance (EC) technique provides a direct measure of the net flux density across the atmosphere-ecosystem interface. Still, such data are highly scarce for Central European wetlands. In this work, we present the results of two years (2013-2014) of continuous open-path EC measurements of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at the wetlands of the Biebrza National Park in northeastern Poland - one of the biggest coherent lowland wetland area in Central Europe. The measurement site (53(circle)35'30.8"N, 22(circle)53'32.4"E) was located near the Kopytkowka river in a fen peatland, whose soils are slightly decomposed due to dehydration. The mean annual sum of CH4 release equaled 29 +/- 4g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in wetter year 2013 and 20 +/- 1g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in drier year 2014. The mean annual uptake of CO2 reached 980 +/- 150 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) and 560 +/- 130 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Both fluxes show a clear annual pattern with maximum CH4 release in June and July (at a level of 130 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) and maximum CO2 uptake in June (at a level of 4.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The considerable C-CO2 uptake in comparison to C-CH4 emissions suggests that the Biebrza river wetlands are a significant carbon sink, but the net contribution of the Biebrza mires to the climate forcing is unclear because of different metrics which can be used to specify the relative weights of CO2 and CH4.

AB Use of biofuel ashes for the afforestation of cutaway peatlands helps to balance the content of nutrients in peat substrate, which improves the survival of planted seedlings and increases significantly bio-production. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of fertilization with alkaline ashes on the above-and belowground biomass formation of four-year-old Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and five-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands on a cutaway peatland. Five treatments were established: three mixtures with different proportions of wood ash (10-15 t ha(-1)) and oil shale ash (10-15 t ha(-1)), pure oil shale ash (10 t ha(-1)) and control (unfertilized plot). Three years after fertilization with ashes the content of phosphorus was up to 150 times and that of potassium 23 times higher in the peat substrate treated with ashes than on the control plot. The growth and biomass formation varied among treatments and depends strongly on the content of P and K in the growth substrate. The best results were observed on plots of Silver birch treated with mixed ashes; there the seedlings annual height increment was 2-3 times (first year), 5-7 times (second year) and 8-9 times (third year) greater than on the control plot. The effect of mixed ashes on the annual height increment of Scots pine was weaker: the annual height increment was 1.4 times (first year), 3 times (second year) and 5 times (third year) greater than on the control plot. The effect of pure oil shale ash on the growth and biomass formation of trees was the smallest. The greatest root collar diameter increment of birch and pine was observed on the third vegetation period. Roots formed the largest part of the total Silver birch biomass, followed by stem, branches and leaves. At the end of the third year after treatment the largest part of the biomass of Scots pine was allocated to the needles, followed by roots, stem and branches. The biomass and biomass production were the greatest on the plots treated with mixed ashes, especially on the WA15+ OSA10 and WA15+ OSA10 treatments. The total bioproductivity of birch was until 4 times intense than in the case of pine. The average current annual biomass production of Silver birch and Scots pine stands were respectively 0.17-0.21 t ha(-1) and 0.3-0.56 t ha(-1) (mixed ashes), 0.04 t ha(-1) and 0.16 t ha(-1) (OSA10) and 0.02 t ha(-1) (control).

AB Uncertainty regarding changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quantity and quality has created interest in managing peatlands for their ecosystem services such as drinking water provision. The evidence base for such interventions is, however, sometimes contradictory. We performed a laboratory climate manipulation using a factorial design on two dominant peatland vegetation types (Calluna vulgaris and Sphagnum Spp.) and a peat soil collected from a drinking water catchment in Exmoor National Park, UK. Temperature and rainfall were set to represent baseline and future conditions under the UKCP09 2080s high emissions scenario for July and August. DOC leachate then underwent standard water treatment of coagulation/flocculation before chlorination. C. vulgaris leached more DOC than Sphagnum Spp. (7.17 versus 3.00 mg g(-1)) with higher specific ultraviolet (SUVA) values and a greater sensitivity to climate, leaching more DOC under simulated future conditions. The peat soil leached less DOC (0.37 mg g(-1)) than the vegetation and was less sensitive to climate. Differences in coagulation removal efficiency between the DOC sources appears to be driven by relative solubilisation of protein-like DOC, observed through the fluorescence peak C/T. Post-coagulation only differences between vegetation types were detected for the regulated disinfection by-products (DBPs), suggesting climate change influence at this scale can be removed via coagulation. Our results suggest current biodiversity restoration programmes to encourage Sphagnum Spp. will result in lower DOC concentrations and SUVA values, particularly with warmer and drier summers.

AB The state of California recommends that aquatic pesticide users obtain NPDES permits in response to recent legal decisions by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Due to the high cost of NPDES permitting, nonchemical aquatic plant control methods are receiving renewed attention in California. Five case studies were evaluated to determine cost and implementation issues for alternative plant control methods in waters of the San Francisco Bay-Delta region. The primary case study examined control costs, operation, and endangered species permitting for mechanical shredding of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Additional case Studies examined control costs for the use of backhoe excavators, manually operated weed-trimmers, or grazing by goats (Capra hircus) to control submersed, emergent, or riparian vegetation. In the fall of 2003 and the spring of 2004, three types of shredding boats were operated on two representative sites. Two boats were operable in all conditions, provided there was sufficient water depth (> 0.3 to 0.6 m). A third boat was difficult to maneuver, could not chop large plants, and repeatedly got mired in dense vegetation. Treatment costs varied widely as a function of plant size. In the fall, costs in three of the four sites were greater than $4,000/hectare (ha). In the spring, treatment costs ranged from $477 to $2,146/ha, comparable to chemical herbicide application. Control costs also varied widely among the other case studies, ranging from $456/ha for goat grazing on riparian vegetation to $24,200/ha using manually operated weed-trimmers to control cattails (Typha latifola) and bulrush (Schpus acutus).

AB Black spruce (Picea mariana) is the most abundant tree species in the boreal biome. but little is known about how climate warming may change recruitment in peatlands, especially those affected by permafrost thaw. We used results from a seven-year study in northern Manitoba, Canada, to address the following questions: (1) What is the relative importance of early life history transitions oil P. mariana recruitment? (2) How are these transitions mediated by biological and environmental factors, including competition, facilitation, disease, herbivory, water table depth, and soil nutrients'? (3) Do interactions among these factors create additional recruitment limitations beyond those imposed by environmental factors changing with climate warming, Such as hydrology? Seed rain was measured over six years on forested permafrost plateaus and in neighboring collapse sear bogs. Seed germination and seedling survival' and growth were measured over 4-5 years in collapse scars and assessed across a three-level water table treatment. Survival and growth experiments examined additional combinations of above- and belowground vascular plant competition and fertilizer addition. Results showed that failure of germination and survival on growing moss surfaces and reduced survival of seedlings in wetter microsites were primary constraints. Seed influx was significantly lower in collapse scars but likely did not limit recruitment. Biological and environmental factors mediating these life history transitions also differed in relative importance, and interactions among them tended to amplify recruitment limitation. Seedling survival was most strongly controlled by fast-growing mosses in wet microsites but also was influenced by apparent drowning, in wet plots, herbivory, and loss of foliage caused by a fungal pathogen. Seedling growth was strongly controlled by water table depth, nutrient and competition levels, and fungal pathogens. Multiple, interacting factors will affect P. mariana establishment in boreal peatlands during climate warming. Generalizations about recruitment relying on few environmental gradients sensitive to climate change, such as water table, may therefore not fully capture the complexities of establishment.

AB Extreme climate events are predicted to become more frequent and intense. Their ecological impacts, particularly on carbon cycling, can differ in relation to ecosystem sensitivity. Peatlands, being characterized by peat accumulation under waterlogged conditions, can be particularly sensitive to climate extremes if the climate event increases soil oxygenation. However, a mechanistic understanding of peatland responses to persistent climate extremes is still lacking, particularly in terms of aboveground-belowground feedback. Here, we present the results of a transplantation experiment of peat mesocosms from high to low altitude in order to simulate, during 3years, a mean annual temperature c. 5 degrees C higher and a mean annual precipitation c. 60% lower. Specifically, we aim at understanding the intensity of changes for a set of biogeochemical processes and their feedback on carbon accumulation. In the transplanted mesocosms, plant productivity showed a species-specific response depending on plant growth forms, with a significant decrease (c. 60%) in peat moss productivity. Soil respiration almost doubled and Q(10) halved in the transplanted mesocosms in combination with an increase in activity of soil enzymes. Spectroscopic characterization of peat chemistry in the transplanted mesocosms confirmed the deepening of soil oxygenation which, in turn, stimulated microbial decomposition. After 3years, soil carbon stock increased only in the control mesocosms whereas a reduction in mean annual carbon accumulation of c. 30% was observed in the transplanted mesocosms. Based on the above information, a structural equationmodel was built to provide a mechanistic understanding of the causal connections between peat moisture, vegetation response, soil respiration and carbon accumulation. This study identifies, in the feedback between plant and microbial responses, the primary pathways explaining the reduction in carbon accumulation in response to recurring climate extremes in peat soils.

AB We investigated the abundance, community composition and transcriptional activity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in the acidic fen Schloppnerbrunnen (Germany) that was subjected to water table manipulations. Quantitative PCR targeting amoA gene copies and transcripts showed that AOA dominated the ammonia-oxidizing community in the upper 20 cm of the peat soil. Numbers of archaeal amoA gene copies and transcripts as well as the relative fraction of AOA of the total archaea decreased with depth. AOA-AmoA sequences were 96.298.9% identical to that of Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra while bacterial AmoA sequences affiliated with Nitrosospira clusters 2 and 4. Archaeal but not bacterial amoA transcripts were detected in short-term laboratory incubations of peat that showed nitrifying activity. Nitrate accumulated in the peat pore water after 6 weeks of induced drought during a field experiment. Subsequent rewetting resulted in a significant decrease of AOA transcriptional activity, indicating that AOA responded to water table fluctuations on the transcriptional level. Our results suggest that nitrification in this fen is primarily linked to archaeal ammonia oxidation. pH and anoxia appear to be key factors regulating AOA community composition, vertical distribution and activity in acidic fens.

AB Northern latitude peatlands contain large reserves of soil carbon (C) due in part to climatic constraints on decomposition, including low temperatures and water inundated soils. Under future climate change scenarios these peatlands will experience warmer temperatures, extended growing seasons, and a potential draw down of the water table, all of which improve conditions for decomposition, as well as photosynthesis. Increased photosynthesis may feedback to increase decomposition of soil C through increased root exudates to belowground decomposer communities, primarily as low molecular weight carbon compounds (LMWCC). In this study, we examine the interactive effects of climate, a combination of three temperatures and two moisture regimes, and root exudates on microbial decomposer function, measured as CO2 respiration, biomass, and potential enzyme activity. We had four substrate treatments: two common LMWCC (glycine or glucose + citric acid), chitin to simulate fungal necromass, and DI as the control. Our results support our first hypothesis that increasing temperature will increase C respiration across substrate and moisture treatments. Our second hypothesis was that compared to control and chitin, soluble substrates (i.e., LMWCC) will enhance respiration across all climate treatments. This was only partially supported. As expected, the two LMWCC substrate additions increased C respiration above the two other substrate additions at current recorded growing season average (12 degrees C, low treatment) and high (20 degrees C, med treatment) temperature treatments. Surprisingly, when the system was pushed to a higher temperature extreme (28 degrees C, high treatment), the low moisture controls respired more C than the other substrate x climate treatments. Potential enzyme activity and demand for phosphorus appear to explain these trends as opposed to changes to microbial biomass. Our results indicate that under projected future high temperatures, the peatland microbial community allocates additional labile C resources to enzyme production to meet nutrient demands, and as such, dampens C lost through respiration.

ID VEGETATION
AB This investigation examined the species diversity and vegetation structure of the peat swamp forest on Mindanao Island, Philippines in relation to peat thickness, hydrology and physicochemical properties of soil and water. Sampling plots were randomly established along a relatively straight transect from the eastern side of the fringing tall pole forest towards the inner zone of pygmy forest, as well as in forest on the Kasawangan lakeshore in the western part of the peatland. The results showed that additional previously unidentified vegetation zones could be distinguished between the tall pole forest and the pygmy forest; i. e. tall intermediate forest and low intermediate forest. Statistically, these additional zones were strongly supported by analysis of variance on stand structure and by non-metric multidimensional scaling on peat properties. Moreover, a Lycopodium-Dicranopteris dominated plant community, which occurs arbitrarily as patches, was also observed. The tall pole forest was the most diverse forest type. In total, 101 species belonging to 56 families and 81 genera of vascular plants (trees and understorey vegetation) were recorded, with Tristaniopsis decorticata (Myrtaceae) and Thoracostachyum sumatranum (Cyperaceae) being the most dominant. Changes in forest structure from the outer to the inner zone are related to the increase in peat thickness towards the centre of the dome. The changes in structure are influenced by the shallow superficial peat layer and the protective surface layer of the peatland, the acrotelm.

AB The Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area contains over 5,000 ha of peat forming upland swamps (n = 1,858) and numerous freshwater lagoons and lakes such as the Thirlmere Lakes southwest of Sydney. These systems are well known for their water storage capacity, even during dry spells. Here we use peat depth measurements and water content calculations to quantify potential water storage capacity within Lake Baraba in the Thirlmere Lakes National Park. We find that total water storage capacity of the peat in Lake Baraba is 150 +/- 17.3 ML. We also calculate total water storage of peat-forming upland swamps across the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area which totals similar to 60,600 +/- 33,500 ML. The implications of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on the water storage and supply functions of these systems as part of the Sydney water supply catchment provides a strong case for their conservation.

AB This study examined the midday (10:00 to 16:00) growing season (April to October) surface cover CO2 relationships with different canopy closures in a forested upland-peatland-pond complex in the Western Boreal Plain (WBP), north-central Alberta, Canada. Large differences were observed among the forest floors of landscape units with different canopy covers with respect to midday total respiration [(R-tot = vegetation respiration (R-veg) + soil respiration (R-soil)] and gross ecosystem production (GEP), and the seasonal pattern of GEP and R-tot. Highest rates of R-tot, followed the general progression of riparian > upland > open peatland > covered peatland, with high R-soil contributions. Strong correlations were observed between C: N, soil temperature, moisture and R-tot. Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) controlled the GEP, which was highest in the open and covered peatland. GEP and R-tot were highest in the middle of the growing season when soil and air temperatures were warmest; in addition R-veg, contributed more to R-tot during this time. However, R-soil dominated the flux.
   This study demonstrated that controlling environmental factors oil CO, exchange cannot necessarily be extrapolated among land cover units within a sub-humid region, such as Canada's WBP. In addition, forest floors of different land Cover units. and microtopography should be taken into account when discussing understory contributions to CO2 exchange.

AB Climatic relationships were established in two Pb-210 dated pollen sequences from small mires closely surrounded by forest just below actual forest limits ( but about 300 m below potential climatic forest limits) in the northern Swiss Alps ( suboceanic in climate; mainly with Picea) and the central Swiss Alps ( subcontinental; mainly Pinus cembra and Larix) at annual or near-annual resolution from ad 1901 to 1996. Effects of vegetational succession were removed by splitting the time series into early and late periods and by linear detrending. Both pollen concentrations detrended by the depth-age model and modified percentages ( in which counts of dominant pollen types are down-weighted) are correlated by simple linear regression with smoothed climatic parameters with one- and two-year timelags, including average monthly and April/September daylight air temperatures and with seasonal and annual precipitation sums. Results from detrended pollen concentrations suggest that peat accumulation is favoured in the northern-Alpine mire either by early snowmelt or by summer precipitation, but in the central-Alpine mire by increased precipitation and cooler summers, suggesting a position of the northern-Alpine mire near the upper altitudinal limit of peat formation, but of the central-Alpine mire near the lower limit. Results from modi Zed pollen percentages indicate that pollen production by plants growing near their upper altitudinal limit is limited by insufficient warmth in summer, and pollen production by plants growing near their lower altitudinal limit is limited by too-high temperatures. Only weakly significant pollen/climate relationships were found for Pinus cembra and Larix, probably because they experience little climatic stress growing 300 m below the potential climatic forest limit.

TI Response of peatland mosses to burial by wind-dispersed peat

DT Article
ID SPHAGNUM; REGENERATION; RESTORATION
AB When abandoned peatlands undergo restoration following the extraction of peat moss, newly reintroduced diaspores may be buried by particles eroded from the stripped peat (decomposed) or from adjacent extraction activities. This study examined, in the greenhouse, the tolerance of six species of peat mosses to burial by peat. One of the experiments consisted of depositing predetermined thicknesses (0, 10, and 30 mm) of peat onto partially established mats of Sphagnum species and trite mosses. A second experiment evaluated the effect of a wider range of burial depths (maximum set at 40 mm) oil Sphagnum fuscum. After tell weeks of burial, the expansion of the established mosses buried under 10 mm of peat was slowed down but not arrested. Dicranella cerviculata is the only species that did not tolerate being buried. The mosses showed three types of final responses to burial: neutral, in which the increases and decreases in cover were not significantly different between the tested and the control depths (for Sphagnum fuscum buried under 5 mm and Sphagnum fallax buried under 10 mm); negative, in which the decrease in cover was significant at the depth tested (for Sphagnum fuscum, Sphagnum magellanicum, Polytrichum strictum, and Dicranella cerviculata buried under 10 mm or more, and for Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum capillifolium buried under 30 mm of peat); and positive, in which the increase in cover was significant at the depth tested (for Sphagnum capillifolium buried under 10 mm of peat). After burial, mosses emerged by means of ail innovation or a continuity of the stem of the initial individual for the Sphagnum species, and by means of an innovation growing out of the apex of buried individuals in the case of Polytrichum strictum. It appears that restoration efforts may be futile in cases where diaspores and newly established mats are likely to be buried at depths exceeding 10 mm.

ID CO2 EMISSIONS; UK; POWER
AB Onshore wind energy is a key component of the renewable energies used by governments to reduce carbon emissions from electricity production, but will carbon emissions be reduced when wind farms are located on carbon-rich peatands? Wind farms are often located in uplands because most are of low agricultural value, are distant from residential areas, and are windy. Many UK uplands are peatlands, with layers of accumulated peat that represent a large stock of soil carbon. When peatlands are drained for construction there is a higher risk of net carbon loss than for mineral soils. Previous work suggests that wind farms sited on peatlands can reduce net carbon emissions if strictly managed for maximum retention of carbon. Here we show that, whereas in 2010, most sites had potential to provide net carbon savings, by 2040 most sites will not reduce carbon emissions even with careful management. This is due to projected changes in the proportion of fossil fuels used to generate electricity. The results suggest future policy should avoid constructing wind farms on undegraded peatlands unless drainage of peat is minimal and the volume excavated in foundations can be significantly reduced compared to energy output.

AB Micro-scale properties of peat pore space and their influence on hydraulic and transport properties of peat soils have been given little attention so far. Characterizing the variation of these properties in a peat profile can increase our knowledge on the processes controlling contaminant transport through peatlands. As opposed to the common macro-scale (or bulk) representation of groundwater flow and transport processes, a pore network model (PNM) simulates flow and transport processes within individual pores. Here, a pore network modeling code capable of simulating advective and diffusive transport processes through a 3D unstructured pore network was developed; its predictive performance was evaluated by comparing its results to empirical values and to the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This is the first time that peat pore networks have been extracted from X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) images of peat deposits and peat pore characteristics evaluated in a 3D approach. Water flow and solute transport were modeled in the unstructured pore networks mapped directly from mu CT images. The modeling results were processed to determine the bulk properties of peat deposits. Results portray the commonly observed decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth, which was attributed to the reduction of pore radius and increase in pore tortuosity. The increase in pore tortuosity with depth was associated with more decomposed peat soil and decreasing pore coordination number with depth, which extended the flow path of fluid particles. Results also revealed that hydraulic conductivity is isotropic locally, but becomes anisotropic after upscaling to core-scale; this suggests the anisotropy of peat hydraulic conductivity observed in core-scale and field-scale is due to the strong heterogeneity in the vertical dimension that is imposed by the layered structure of peat soils. Transport simulations revealed that for a given solute, the effective diffusion coefficient decreases with depth due to the corresponding increase of diffusional tortuosity. Longitudinal dispersivity of peat also was computed by analyzing advective-dominant transport simulations that showed peat dispersivity is similar to the empirical values reported in the same peat soil; it is not sensitive to soil depth and does not vary much along the soil profile.

AB Fens represent a large array of ecosystem services, including the highest biodiversity found among wetlands, hydrological services, water purification and carbon sequestration. Land-use change and drainage has severely damaged or annihilated these services in many parts of North America and Europe; restoration plans are urgently needed at the landscape level. We review the major constraints on the restoration of rich fens and fen water bodies in agricultural areas in Europe and disturbed landscapes in North America: (i) habitat quality problems: drought, eutrophication, acidification, and toxicity, and (ii) recolonization problems: species pools, ecosystem fragmentation and connectivity, genetic variability, and invasive species; and here provide possible solutions. We discuss both positive and negative consequences of restoration measures, and their causes. The restoration of wetland ecosystem functioning and services has, for a long time, been based on a trial-and-error approach. By presenting research and practice on the restoration of rich fen ecosystems within agricultural areas, we demonstrate the importance of biogeochemical and ecological knowledge at different spatial scales for the management and restoration of biodiversity, water quality, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, especially in a changing climate. We define target processes that enable scientists, nature managers, water managers and policy makers to choose between different measures and to predict restoration prospects for different types of deteriorated fens and their starting conditions.

AB We simulated the effect of prolonged dry summer periods by lowering the water table on three manipulation plots (D1-3) in a minerotrophic fen in southeastern Germany in three years (2006-2008). The water table at this site was lowered by drainage and by excluding precipitation; three nonmanipulated control plots (C1-3) served as a reference. We found no significant differences in soil respiration (R-Soil), gross primary production (GPP), or aboveground respiration (R-AG) between the C1-3 and D1-3 plots in any of the measurement years. The water table on the control plots was naturally low, with a median water table (2006-2008) of 8 cm below the surface, and even lower during summer when respiratory activity was highest, with median values (C1-3) between 11 and 19 cm below the surface. If it is assumed that oxygen availability in the uppermost 10 cm was not limited by the location of the water table, manipulative lowering of the water table most likely increased oxygen availability only in deeper peat layers where we expect R-Soil to be limited by poor substrate quality rather than anoxia. This could explain the lack of a manipulation effect. In a second approach, we estimated the influence of the water table on R-Soil irrespective of treatment. The results showed a significant correlation between R-Soil and water table, but with R-Soil decreasing at lower water tables rather than increasing. We thus conclude that decomposition in the litter layer is not limited by waterlogging in summer, and deeper peat layers bear no significant decomposition potential due to poor substrate quality. Consequently, we do not expect enhanced C losses from this site due to increasing frequency of dry summers. Assimilation and respiration of aboveground vegetation were not affected by water table fluctuations between 10 and >60 cm depth, indicating the lack of stress resulting from either anoxia (high water table) or drought (low water table).

TI Divergent responses of permafrost peatlands to recent climate change
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE permafrost; peatlands; climate change; hydrology; carbon
AB Permafrost peatlands are found in high-latitude regions and store globally-important amounts of soil organic carbon. These regions are warming at over twice the global average rate, causing permafrost thaw, and exposing previously inert carbon to decomposition and emission to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. However, it is unclear how peatland hydrological behaviour, vegetation structure and carbon balance, and the linkages between them, will respond to permafrost thaw in a warming climate. Here we show that permafrost peatlands follow divergent ecohydrological trajectories in response to recent climate change within the same rapidly warming region (northern Sweden). Whether a site becomes wetter or drier depends on local factors and the autogenic response of individual peatlands. We find that bryophyte-dominated vegetation demonstrates resistance, and in some cases resilience, to climatic and hydrological shifts. Drying at four sites is clearly associated with reduced carbon sequestration, while no clear relationship at wetting sites is observed. We highlight the complex dynamics of permafrost peatlands and warn against an overly-simple approach when considering their ecohydrological trajectories and role as C sinks under a warming climate.

AB Peatlands in the northern hemisphere have accumulated more atmospheric carbon (C) during the Holocene than any other terrestrial ecosystem, making peatlands long-term C sinks of global importance. Projected increases in nitrogen (N) deposition and temperature make future accumulation rates uncertain.
   Here, we assessed the impact of N deposition on peatland C sequestration potential by investigating the effects of experimental N addition on Sphagnum moss. We employed meta-regressions to the results of 107 field experiments, accounting for sampling dependence in the data.
   We found that high N loading (comprising N application rate, experiment duration, background N deposition) depressed Sphagnum production relative to untreated controls. The interactive effects of presence of competitive vascular plants and high tissue N concentrations indicated intensified biotic interactions and altered nutrient stochiometry as mechanisms underlying the detrimental N effects. Importantly, a higher summer temperature (mean for July) and increased annual precipitation intensified the negative effects of N. The temperature effect was comparable to an experimental application of almost 4 g N m(-2) yr(-1) for each 1 degrees C increase.
   Our results indicate that current rates of N deposition in a warmer environment will strongly inhibit C sequestration by Sphagnum-dominated vegetation.

AB Natural Boreal saline fens provide analogues for reclaimed wetland systems constructed with sodium-rich tailings materials. These natural analogues can improve our understanding of vegetative controls on dominant ecohydrological processes (i.e. evapotranspiration (ET)) in constructed landscapes. Therefore, the objective of this study is to characterize ET within a natural boreal saline fen over a growing season to determine the primary hydro-climatic controls using community-scale ET measurements targeting dominant vegetation communities within different microforms along with environmental controls. ET rates were highest during periods of peak vegetation growth and temperatures between June and August, with rates decreasing slightly in July. Vegetation species' physiology was the dominant variable governing ET. The more salt tolerant species maintained higher ET rates despite the lower leaf area index and water table levels found within these species. The lower ET rates measured in July can be attributed to high water tables from above average precipitation causing soil inundation and salt stress, increasing stomatal closure. However, community plots containing Triglochin maritima maintained transpiration rates under the coupled stress conditions. Therefore, this is a potentially important species for use in boreal reclamation planting schemes. Last, the findings emphasize that the dominant vegetation selected for reclamation projects must coincide with the materials used (peat and subsurface materials), as results within this study demonstrate that some native boreal fen species (Calamagrostis inexpansa, Hordeum jubatum, and Juncus balticus) were unable to maintain transpiration rates during flood and saline conditions that can occur within the mining area of this region.

AB Racemization of free amino acids in a native peat bog at seven depths from 0 to 5.3 m was studied using glass capillary gas chromatography with a chiral liquid phase, Chirasil-L-Val. Fifteen L-enantiomers were identified: alpha-Ala, Val, Thr, Ile, Pro, Leu, Ser, Asp, Phe, Glu, Tyr, Orn, Met, Asn and Lys. Five D-enantiomers were also found: alpha-Ala, Ser, Asp, Glu and Phe. The D/L ratios at different depths were determined and are discussed in terms of racemization, plant and microbial degradation, and the physical and chemical conditions in the peat bog. In addition, three optically inactive amino acids were identified: beta-Ala, Gly and gamma-aminobutyric acid.

AB Even though large extents of boreal peatlands are still in a pristine condition, especially in North America, extensive areas have been affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances that change some of the systems from being sinks to sources of carbon dioxide and shift the methane production/consumption patterns through alterations of both above- and below-ground communities and functions. In order to fully assess the role of peatlands on global C balance, now and in the future, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of the relative contributions of various groups of microorganisms to organic matter transformations. Here, we review the drivers structuring fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in natural peatlands and the response of these microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, drainage, nutrient deposition, peat mining and climate change. The microbial diversity in peatlands is characterized by organisms that have developed physiological and metabolic adaptations to cope with the constraining conditions found in these ecosystems, such as low oxygen availability, cold temperature, acidity and oligotrophy. Furthermore, these unique organisms sometimes appear to be organized as repeat mosaics responding to vegetation, physicochemical and hydrological characteristics more than to geographical distance, in other words, similar to the much valued biodiversity aspects of the peatland vegetation itself and associated higher organisms. The response of microbial communities to disturbances is far from fully understood. In particular, whilst many studies have identified changes in microbial community composition or on microbially driven processes following a given disturbance, it remains unclear how the two components, diversity and function, relate with each other. Future challenges involve designing studies that will test whether ecological theories like species sorting, stress physiology, temporal niche or functional redundancy can be used to understand what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatlands, and studies that will allow us to predict more accurately how peatlands respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB While the physical processes driving energy fluxes in the high latitudes are universal, some of the controlling factors such as permafrost, temperature, and vegetation play a special role. Annual net radiation at Arctic treeline is larger over subarctic forest than over tundra as a result of smaller albedo during the snow-cover period. The absorbed solar radiation is notably larger in late winter. During the snow-free period, in well-watered areas, there is a hierarchy in potential evaporation from very high rates for shallow tundra lakes and ponds to low rates for well-drained upland heath terrain. With abundant moisture and warm conditions, open coniferous forests, dwarf deciduous forests, and sedge fens have similar energy and water balances. During the growing season when moisture is limiting, a sedge fen, more so than a coniferous forest, curtails its evaporation rate. Under cold conditions, however, coniferous forest has the smaller evaporation. Soil heat fluxes in summer comprise from 10% to 15% of the net radiation and are fairly uniform both temporally and spatially. The carbon budget of peatlands, which are major global repositories of carbon, responds strongly to air and soil temperatures and to the water balance. Warm and wet conditions support strong photosynthesis and a substantial methane flux. Warm and dry conditions favor strong respiration carbon losses from plants and soil. In a 2 x CO(2) world, substantial changes in temperature, precipitation, and energy and water balances are anticipated and these will drive substantial changes in the high-latitude carbon budget.

AB Calcareous spring fens are among the rarest and most endangered wetland types worldwide. The majority of these ecosystems can be found at high latitudes, where they are affected by above average rates of climate change. Particularly winter temperatures are increasing, which results in decreased snow cover. As snow provides an insulating layer that protects ecosystems from subzero temperatures, its decrease is likely to induce stress to plants. To investigate the sensitivity of the bryophyte community - key to the functioning of calcareous spring fens - to changing climatic conditions, we studied the annual variation in ecophysiology of two dominant bryophytes: Campylium stellatum and Scorpidium scorpioides. Further, a snow removal experiment was used to simulate the effect of changing winter conditions. In both species, we observed lowest efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) in spring, indicating physiological stress, and highest chlorophyll-a, -b and carotenoid concentrations in autumn. Snowremoval exacerbated physiological stress in bryophytes. Consequently Fv/Fm, pigment concentrations and chlorophyll to carotenoids ratios declined, while chlorophyll-a to -b ratios increased. Moreover, these effects of winter climate change cascaded to the growing season. C. stellatum, a low hummock inhabitor, suffered more from snow removal (annual mean decline in Fv/Fm 7.7% and 30.0% in chlorophyll-a) than S. scorpioides, a hollow species (declines 5.4% and 14.5%, respectively). Taken together, our results indicate that spring fen bryophytes are negatively impacted by winter climate change, as a result of longer frost periods and increased numbers of freeze-thaw cycles in combination with higher light intensity and dehydration.

AB Using imagery of the Canadian boreal forest, we explored the ability of the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to map vegetation type by taking advantage of pigment and water absorption features. Two techniques were exploited. In the first classification routine, laboratory-acquired leaf spectra representing different "pigment classes" were used in a spectral unmixing procedure to map the relative abundance of pigments in the landscape. The resulting images were then used in a maximum likelihood routine to map the distribution of vegetation cover types. Accuracies for this method range between 66.6-80.1%, when compared to a vegetation map prepared by the Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management (SERM), Forestry Branch Inventory Unit (FBIU). In the second approach, seven indices of vegetation structure and physiological function were calculated from AVIRIS. Cover types were then derived using the index images as inputs in a maximum likelihood classification. Levels of accuracy for this method were between 56.6 and 73.3%, when compared to the same vegetation map. Both of these complementary techniques were able to differentiate important vegetation types such as fen, deciduous trees, and wet and dry conifers at accuracies superior to other well-established classification methods for this area. This improved vegetation classification can now be used to evaluate regional surface-atmosphere fluxes of carbon and water vapor.

AB Herbivory is an important part of most ecosystems, and grazing alone can have a considerable impact on the ecosystems carbon balance with both direct and indirect effects. Removal of above-ground biomass by consumption of herbivores will change the below-ground carbon stock; the reduction of litter that goes into the ground will influence the total ecosystem carbon content. Little is however known about how plant-herbivory interactions effect the carbon balance, in particular methane emissions, of high arctic mires. We hypothesized that increased grazing pressure will change carbon allocation patterns resulting in decreased net ecosystem uptake of carbon and subsequently in lower methane emissions. An in-situ field experiment was conducted over 3 years in a high arctic mire at Zackenberg in NE Greenland. The experiment consisted of three treatments, with five replicates of each (1) control, (2) vascular plants were removed (NV), (3) clipped twice each growing season in order to simulate increased muskox grazing. Immediately after the initiation of the experiment net ecosystem uptake of CO2 decreased in clipped plots (mean total decrease for the three following years was 35 %). One year into the experiment a significantly lower CH4 emission was observed in these plots, the total mean reduction for the following 2 years was 26 %. Three years into the experiment significantly lower substrate (acetic acid) availability for CH4 production was observed (27 % reduction). NV plots had a mean decrease in CO2 uptake of 113 %, a 62 % decrease in ecosystem respiration and an 84 % decrease in CH4 emission (mean of all 3 years). Our study shows that increased grazing pressure in a high arctic mire can lead to significant changes in the carbon balance, with lower CO2 uptake leading to lower production of substrate for CH4 formation and in lower CH4 emission.

AB A detailed palynological investigation of the Wulfersdorf seams and associated sediments within the Upper Seam Group of Helmstedt has been carried out with the aim of demonstrating the potential of palynological analysis for paleoecological information. 182 taxa of spores, pollen and plankton are described in a systematic chapter and figured on 14 plates. The results of quantitative analysis and the distribution of palynomorphs are presented in 12 high-resolution pollen diagrams from different sections of the lignite bearing succession. In order to provide a more objective ecological evaluation various methods of multivariate statistics such as cluster analysis and principal component analysis were applied. In addition, isopollen maps have been constructed from a carbonaceous band occurring within an estuarine interbed and representing a brief terrestrialisation event. Sampling was carried out along a narrow time plane during mining progress. Based on both, statistical analyses and isopollen maps, a detailed vegetation model of a Middle Eocene coastal swamp has been constructed.
   The Middle Eocene coastal plain vegetation in the Helmstedt area was characterized by a clear zonation in response to the proximity of the coast and exposure to salt-water. Thus, variations in composition of palynomorph assemblages are controlled by shifts of environment and facies rather than climatic effects. A mangrove belt comparable to modern mangroves is indicated by the restricted occurrence of pollen of Rhizophora, Avicennia and Nypa as well as the form taxon Psilodiporites iszkaszentgyoergyi of uncertain botanical affinity. Behind the mangrove zone, pollen of Restionaceae and Sparganiaceae/Typhaceae indicate the presence of a more open, marsh-like vegetation together with the closely associated Plicapollis pseudoexcelsus and Pompeckjoidaepollenites subhercynicus, probably pollen of woody plants of known resp. assumed juglandaceous affinity. Other elements, such as palms apparently grew in restricted stands, perhaps in tree islands dotting the more open marsh-like vegetation, since their pollen shows a patchy distribution. The main peat forming vegetation was a mire forest dominated by Fagaceae and associated with Myricaceae, Juglandaceae, Aquifoliaceae and Nyssaceae. This occured in alternation with a Corylaceae dominated forest including Cyrillaceae and Sapotaceae. Ericaceae probably formed an understorey on nutrient deficient soils.

AB In high-latitude ecosystems climate change induced plant community shifts toward dominance of shrubs and trees will potentially have large consequences for soil carbon dynamics. Changes in the litter layer due to an altered quantity and quality of litter input, or by its indirect effect on the microclimate, might affect the decomposer community.
   To be able to predict the effects of increased litter input on decomposers and consequently on soil carbon dynamics, we studied the contribution of Collembola to carbon processing in a high-latitude peat bog system. Moreover, we assessed the effects of changing litter inputs on their abundance, diversity and diet choice, using a C-13 tracer approach.
   The delta C-13 signatures of Collembola in peat moss (Sphagnum fuscum) showed that species differed in their diet. However, when vascular plant litter (Betula pubescens) entered the Sphagnum peat ecosystem, the delta C-13 signatures of the Collembola, changed and species-specific differences disappeared. There were no significant changes in Collembola species composition and density after Betula litter addition, but all species showed a strong dietary preference for Betula-associated food sources over Sphagnum; 67% of their diet contained carbon originating from Betula litter. Decomposition patterns corresponded to these findings; mass loss (after 406 days of incubation) of Betula increased from 16.1% to 26.2% when decomposing in combination with Sphagnum, and Sphagnum decomposed even slower in combination with Betula litter (from 4.7% to 1.9%).
   Our results indicate that the change in litter quality rather than its effects on microclimate is the main way in which vascular litter inputs alter the role of Collembola in carbon turnover. Collembola are plastic in their diet choice, which implies that changes in carbon turnover rates in situations where vegetation shifts occur, might well be due to diet shifts of the present decomposer community rather than by changes in species composition.

AB In this study, a suite of complementary environmental geochemical analyses, including NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of central metabolites, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) of secondary metabolites, and lipidomics, was used to investigate the influence of organic matter (OM) quality on the heterotrophic microbial mechanisms controlling peatland CO2, CH4, and CO2:CH4 porewater production ratios in response to climate warming. Our investigations leverage the Spruce and Peatland Responses under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment, where air and peat warming were combined in a whole-ecosystem warming treatment. We hypothesized that warming would enhance the production of plant-derived metabolites, resulting in increased labile OM inputs to the surface peat, thereby enhancing microbial activity and greenhouse gas production. Because shallow peat is most susceptible to enhanced warming, increases in labile OM inputs to the surface, in particular, are likely to result in significant changes to CO2 and CH4 dynamics and methanogenic pathways. In support of this hypothesis, significant correlations were observed between metabolites and temperature consistent with increased availability of labile substrates, which may stimulate more rapid turnover of microbial proteins. An increase in the abundance of methanogenic genes in response to the increase in the abundance of labile substrates was accompanied by a shift toward acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogenesis. Our results suggest that as peatland vegetation trends toward increasing vascular plant cover with warming, we can expect a concomitant shift toward increasingly methanogenic conditions and amplified climate-peatland feedbacks.

AB We surveyed populations of Eurodryas aurinia (a butterfly listed as 'Threatened in Europe') in Glamorgan (South Wales, UK). The survey may provide a model for similar work, which is urgently needed throughout the species' European range. For each colony, we established population size, vegetation types, and current management regimes. Populations were assessed using larval surveys, a method which has several advantages over conventional adult surveys. With approximately 35 local populations, Glamorgan is among the most important areas for E. aurinia in the UK, and is of importance in a European context. However, 15 local populations were under immediate threat from unfavourable management or industrial developments, and only seven populations were on Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Colonies showed a clustered pattern, and varied greatly in size: 50% supported 20 or fewer larval webs. Many of the small populations may be temporary offshoots of larger, more permanent populations nearby. The largest local populations occupied Molinia caerulea - Cirsium dissectum fen meadow habitats (National Vegetation Community M24), which were unmanaged, grazed by cattle, horses or ponies, or subject to periodic burning. Detailed local surveys such as this one, which assess the relative sizes of populations and the impact of current management practices, may be the best way to plan future conservation measures for E. aurinia.

AB A widespread misconception is that coals correspond to single palaeo-peat bodies, which represent continuous and time-invariant records of peat accumulation. Evidence for the occurrence of intra-seam hiatal surfaces within datasets from bituminous coals, lignites and modern peats suggests that existing depositional models for peat and coal require modification. Recognition that coals may represent a succession of stacked mires separated by hiatal surfaces has implications for palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphic studies that assume a continuous record of peat accumulation, as well as for the prediction of whole-seam composition and thickness trends.

AB Depending on the soil preparation method applied and peat characteristics. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings planted in prepared spots on forestry-drained peatlands may become more susceptible to extreme weather events such as drought or flooding. Only by studying its coping strategies can we eventually design methodology better suited for Scots pine regeneration on peat soils. In this study, we evaluated the tolerance of two-year-old seedlings to the two extremes of water-associated stress, drought and waterlogging, in unprocessed peat. Over one growing season in controlled conditions, drought distinctly reduced root and shoot growth in addition to photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) particularly in previous-year needles, whilst wet stress had little discernible impact. Drought also influenced polyamine metabolism by increasing free putrescine and spermine concentrations especially in current-year needles, whereas no impact was discerned in the wet treatment. Furthermore, reduced root hydraulic conductance (K-r) was observed in drought-stressed root systems. Apparently, waterlogging does not modify Scots pine seedling growth or vitality immediately, but rather in the longer term. However, no fatalities occurred in either of the stress treatments, this despite water availability in the Sphagnum peat reaching its lower (permanent wilting point) and upper (10% soil air content) limits. Maintenance of rather high photochemical efficiency despite severe drought stress would seem to indicate a potential for seedling recovery if water availability in the peat substrate improved.

AB In this study, we assess how representative a single charcoal record from a peat profile in small bogs (1.5-2 ha in area) is for the reconstruction of Holocene fire history. We use high-resolution macrocharcoal (>250 mu m) analysis of continuous series of 2 cm(3)samples from two small bogs in southern Sweden. We compare (1) duplicate charcoal records from the same core, (2) duplicate charcoal records from profiles in the same site (10 m apart), and (3) charcoal records from two sites within the same region (15 km apart). Comparisons are made for charcoal counts and area expressed as accumulation rates. The results suggest that (a) charcoal counts and area are highly correlated in all records; (b) duplicate charcoal records within the same core are very similar, although some charcoal peaks are found in only one of the two records; (c) although long-term trends in fire regimes are similar between duplicate charcoal records from nearby profiles within the same site and between charcoal records from sites within the same region, some individual charcoal peaks/fire events are asynchronous between records. The known historical fires of the town of Vaxjo (1570 and 1612 CE) are recorded at the two study sites, which indicates a macrocharcoal source area of minimum 15 km in diameter. The 2 cm(3)peat samples contained relatively low amounts of macrocharcoal; we therefore recommend to analyse larger samples from small peat bogs with comparable peat accumulation rates. This will improve the reliability of the macrocharcoal record and its interpretation.

AB Changing growing-season properties in the northern latitudes are among the most obvious consequences of ongoing global change. Available techniques including satellite monitoring and phenological observations enable the detection of changes over the last few decades to centuries, but the full range of natural variability is still difficult to capture. Here we introduce a new approach to reconstruct growing season properties, by studying imprints of prolonged growing season on epidermal cell growth in Betula nana. A high correlation between cell expansion determined in annually collected B. nana leaves and subfossil leaf fragments collected from recent peat sections in northern Scandinavia, and climatic indices such as budburst date, growing-season degree-days and May September mean temperatures, enable the establishment of a new micro-phenological proxy for growing season characteristics. The applicability of the epidermal cell undulation index (UI) is tested by comparison with historical instrumental records of growing-season degree-days for the last 200 a. The results demonstrate the potential of the new leaf-morphology-based technique to reconstruct and quantify past changes in growing degree-days beyond instrumental data series. Applied to abundant B. nana leaf remains from peat and lake sediments, the UI may enable a reconstruction of growing degree-days throughout the Holocene and other parts of the late Quaternary.

AB The effect of land-reclamation on the surface and subsurface runoff is studied in Ust'-Selenga depression has been analyzed. Drainage and irrigation activities intensified peat oxidation destruction, resulting in a more intense input of peat decomposition products (i.e., ammonium, nitrite and nitrate ions, as well as soluble organics). Surface and subsurface water draining the bog are favorable for the intense migration of iron and manganese ions in solution.

AB Using a wide range of conditions and plant community types, species diversity was investigated in relation to edaphic and non-edaphic site conditions, management, and biomass characteristics. Both standing biomass and aboveground production were investigated, and their effects compared. Three taxonomic assemblages were studied: (1) vascular plants only, (2) bryophytes also included, (3) terrestrial lichens included as well. Using a multivariate approach, both species richness and evenness could best be explained when only vascular plants were considered, emphasizing the role of taxonomic restrictions. The models best explaining species richness merely required abiotic conditions. This supports recent theories emphasizing the importance of an environmental regulation of the pool of (adapted) species from which the actual species are recruited. Explanatory soil properties were moisture and pH (both unimodal), and the soil available N:P ratio. Plots with large perimeter:area ratios had significantly more species than those with low ratios, indicating the importance of consistency in quadrat shape. Hump-shaped species richness relationships could be identified for both standing biomass and productivity, but they explained only a small part of the variation and were apparent only if soil and management effects were not accounted for. Unimodality (and notably the decreasing phase) was most pronounced when using maximum standing biomass, suggesting that the key factor is competition for light. At intermediate levels of standing biomass, the positive effects of habitat productivity and the negative effects of standing biomass itself are in balance, and high species numbers may be expected. When soil or management variables were allowed in the models, hump-shaped biomass relationships were no longer confirmed, suggesting that such relationships may arise from the covariation of biomass with other factors. Management explained a much larger part of the variation than the hump-shaped biomass relationship, suggesting that mowing and hay removal (both showing independent positive effects) regulate species richness in ways other than solely through the control of maximum standing biomass. Significantly higher evenness values were obtained at sites with low maximum biomass values, but only for the vascular plants. In addition, species evenness was positively related to the frequency of mowing. The numbers of both rare and endangered species were strongly curtailed by high standing biomass values, suggesting that these species are more susceptible to competitive exclusion than others. Through direct as well as indirect effects, management is confirmed to be beneficial not only for general species richness, but also for the occurrence of rare and endangered species.

AB This study was carried out at Kita-mura near Bibai located in central Hokkaido, Japan, with the intention of investigating the effects of different agronomical managements on CH4 emissions from paddy fields on mineral soil over peat under farmers' actual management conditions in the snowy temperate region. Four fields were studied, including two fields with twice drainage (D-1-M and D-2-M) and also a single-drainage field (D-3-S) under annual single-cropping and a paddy-fallow-paddy crop rotation as their systems. The other field was under single cropping annual with continuous flooding (CF-R) in the pattern of soybean (upland crop)-fallow-paddy. The mineral-soil thickness of these soil-dressed peatland fields varied from 20 to 47 cm. The amount of crop residues leftover in the fields ranged from 277 to 751 g dry matter m(-2). Total CH4 emissions ranged from 25.3 to 116 g CH4-C m(-2) per growing season. There was a significant relationship between crop-residue carbon (C) and total CH4 emissions during the rice-growing season. Methane fluxes from paddy soils had a strong interaction between readily available C source for methanogens and anaerobic conditions created by water management. Despite the differences in water regime and soil type, the average values of straw's efficiency on CH4 production in this study were significantly higher than those of southern Japan and statistically identical with central Hokkaido. Our results suggest that the environmental conditions of central Hokkaido in association with crop-residue management had a significant influence on CH4 emission from paddy fields on mineral soil over peat. Rotation soybean (upland)-to-paddy followed by drainage-twice practices also largely reduces CH4 emission. However, mineral-soil dressing on peat could have a significant impact on suppression of CH4 emissions from beneath the peat reservoir.

AB Northern peatlands are important stores of carbon and reservoirs of biodiversity that are vulnerable to global change. However, the carbon dynamics of individual peatland plant species is poorly understood, despite the potential for rising atmospheric CO2 to affect the vegetation's contribution to overall ecosystem carbon function. Here, we examined the effects of 3 years exposure to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on (a) peatland plant community composition and biomass, and (b) plant carbon dynamics and the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase approach. Results showed that under eCO(2), Sphagnum spp. cover declined by 39% (P < 0.05) and Juncus effusus L. cover increased by 40% (P < 0.001). There was a concurrent increase in above- and belowground plant biomass of 115% (P < 0.01) and 96% (P < 0.01), respectively. Vascular species assimilated and turned over more (CO2)-C-13-derived carbon than Sphagnum spp. (49% greater turnover of assimilated C-13 in J. effusus and F. ovina L. leaf tissues compared with Sphagnum, P < 0.01). Elevated CO2 also produced a 66% rise in DOC concentrations (P < 0.001) and an order of magnitude more 'new' exudate (DOC)-D-13 than control samples (24 h after (CO2)-C-13 pulse-labelling 2.5 +/- 0.5 and 0.2 +/- 0.1% in eCO(2) and control leachate, respectively, P < 0.05). We attribute the observed increase in DOC concentrations under eCO(2) to the switch from predominantly Sphagnum spp. to vascular species (namely J. effusus), leading to enhanced exudation and decomposition (litter and peat). The potential for reduced peatland carbon accretion, increased DOC exports and positive feedback to climate change are discussed.

AB Statistical analysis of a vast body of data collected during five field seasons (2011-2015) was performed to characterize the biological activity of soils in the northern taiga ecosystems of Western Siberia. Automorphic forest soils, hydromorphic (oligotrophic bog) soils, and semihydromorphic (flat-topped and large peat mounds) soils were characterized. Statistically significant differences of average levels of CO2 emission from the soils were identified at the ecosystem level. The CO2 emission from podzols of automorphic forest ecosystems at the peak of the growing season (205 +/- 30 to 410 +/- 40 mg CO2/(m(2) h)) was significantly higher than the emission from semihydromorphic soils of peat mounds (70 +/- 20 to 116 +/- 10 mg CO2/(m(2) h)). The presence and depth of permafrost was a significant factor that affected ecosystem diversity and biological activity of northern taiga soils. Statistically significant differences in the total, labile, and microbial carbon pools were observed for the studied soils. Labile and microbial carbon pools in the organic layer (10 cm) of forest podzols amounted to 0.19 and 0.66 t/ha, respectively; those in the organic layer (40 cm) of peat cryozems of flat-topped peat mounds reached 1.24 and 3.20 t/ha, and those in the oligotrophic peat soils (50 cm) of large peat mounds were 2.76 and 1.35 t/ha, respectively. The portion of microbial carbon in the total carbon pool (C-micr/C-tot, %) varied significantly; according to the values of this index, the soils were arranged into the following sequence: oligotrophic peat soil < peat cryozem < podzol.

Below this critical content, most soils showed a varying degree of water repellence. Well decomposed peat had lower infiltration rates than moderately decomposed peat. Lightly crushing the peat soil before measurement increased the infiltration rate compared with an undisturbed soil sample. In tests with aqueous ethanol of different molarity, peat soils showed greater repellence than gyttja soils. All moss peat layers were extremely water repellent and fen peats slightly less repellent. Water repellence did not occur on gyttja clay and marl gyttja.

AB Highland peatlands are one of the most fragile ecosystems in the world. These ecosystems have vital nutritional importance for livestock, however previous research has indicated that intensive grazing could negatively affect these communities, requiring the application of temporary grazing exclusion to restore the health of the peatland. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of grazing exclusion on plant allocation strategy and carrying capacity of Oxychloe andina Phil. The plant traits of O. andina were quantified through measurements of specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). We estimated the carrying capacity through livestock censuses and vegetational transects. SLA was found to be greater in grazed conditions than in ungrazed conditions (p = 0.0194) at five months after the application of treatments. Additionally, greater productivity associated with greater LDMC in March was observed under conditions of grazing exclusion (p = 0.0306). Production estimates of O. andina reached 4816 kg of dry matter (DM) distributed over an area of 9.84 ha, which was equivalent to 489 kg DM of O. andina DM ha(-1). Using DM production as a proxy of the peatland and considering the average vegetation cover of 70%, the peatland produces an estimated of 1370 kg DM year(-1). The temporary grazing exclusion enhanced the productivity of O. andina. However, depending on DM production in relation to grazing demand, there is a possibility of exceeding the animal load for this plant species.

AB We tested here a plant-soil system to separate recent, plant-derived and native, soil-derived carbon in soil respiration. The approach uses a perennial crop cultivated on an organic soil where upper soil layers have been removed as a result of peat extraction. There, the C-14 signal from native organic matter is highly depleted compared to that in vegetation established at the site after peat extraction ceased. Radiocarbon was analyzed in carbon dioxide respired from soil over one growing season, and a two-pool isotope mixing model was applied to calculate the relative contribution of old vs. new carbon sources. The analysis showed that the approach is reliable for source partitioning with isotopes. After six years of cultivation, old peat decomposition contributed less to total soil respiration than respiration of recent plant material (30% vs. 70% on average, respectively), but the relative proportions were highly variable over the growing season. The approach offers a new possibility to follow the fate of old, native soil organic matter in highly organic soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peat sediments and peatland evolution process offer abundant clues into the history of vegetation and climate changes. In order to reconstruct Holocene peatland, vegetation and climate changes on eastern Tibetan Plateau, we conducted analyses of fossil pollen, loss-on-ignition, and carbon accumulation rate on one peat core from Zoige Basin. Our results show local peatland initiated at 10.3 ka, thrived in the early-mid Holocene, and then began to degrade. Throughout the Holocene, Zoige Basin was dominated by alpine meadow. Coniferous forest on montane regions expanded for several times during 10.5-4.6 ka, and then dramatically retreated. Results of peatland property, principal component analysis on fossil pollen suggested the climate maintained warm/wet during 10-5.5 ka, and became relatively cold/dry in the late Holocene. Rapid degradation of peatland, retreat of coniferous forest and climatic drought/cooling occurred at 10.2-10, 9.7-9.5, 8.7-8.5, 7.7-7.4, 6.4-6, 5.5-5.2, 4.8-4.5, 4-3.6, 3.1-2.7, 1.4-1.2 and 0.8-0.6 ka. The long-term variations of Holocene climate and vegetation on eastern Tibetan Plateau could be attributed to changes in insolation-driven temperature and Asian Summer Monsoon intensity, while those rapid centennial changes were probably triggered by abrupt monsoon failures and temperature anomalies in the high northern latitudes.

AB Polygonal peatlands are carbon-rich permafrost ecosystems that will likely be significantly affected by climate change. However, studies are often constrained to one measurement per day, which impedes assessments of the temporal variability in carbon fluxes. For this reason, we measured ecosystem respiration (ER) of CO2 in a polygonal peatland underlain by continuous permafrost over an entire growing season to determine the effects of temperature and water table depth on the temporal variability of ER. We used four automated closed chambers to measure ER under varying temperature and soil moisture regimes. Temporal variability was approximately the same for the four plots, on both a diurnal and a seasonal scale. Both diurnal and seasonal variations in ER were strongly controlled by changes in soil surface temperature. Fluctuations of the water table depth associated with important rainfall events was also an important factor affecting ER on the seasonal scale. We found that water table level fluctuations below 20-25 cm did not significantly affect ER and that most soil respiration took place in the top 10 cm, likely in the surface 2 cm. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring future changes in tundra hydrology, which will determine the depth of organic matter available for aerobic decomposition.

AB Peatland-inhabiting testate amoebae are sensitive indicators of substrate-moisture conditions and have increasingly been used in palaeohydrological studies. However, to improve accuracy of testate-amoeba-based hydrological inferences, baseline ecological data on rare taxa, a larger geographic network of calibration sites, and incorporation of long-term estimates of water-table depth are needed. Species-environment relationships at 369 sites from 31 peatlands in eastern North America were investigated. Long-term estimates of water-table depth were obtained using the method of polyvinyl (PVC) tape-discolouration. Transfer functions were developed using a variety of models, and validated through jackknifing techniques and with an independent dataset where water-table depths were directly measured throughout the growing season. Results indicate that mean annual water-table depth can be inferred from testate amoeba assemblages with a mean error of 6 to 8 cm, although there is a slight systematic bias. All transfer function models performed similarly and produced similar reconstructions on a fossil sequence. In a preliminary effort towards development of a comprehensive North American calibration dataset, data from this study were combined with previous studies in Michigan and the Rocky Mountains (n = 650). This combined dataset had slightly larger mean errors of prediction (8-9 cm) but includes data for several rare taxa. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB An efficient method was developed for the analysis of selected PCBs and PAHs in dry peat samples. The method includes a shaking extraction using acetone and hexane followed by the purification of the crude extract by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) which turned out to be the key clean-up step. The method was used to determine seven indicator PCBs and 16 EPA-PAHs in individual sections of an ombrotrophic peat core in south-west Switzerland. The maximum concentrations of PCBs (19 mug Sigma PCBs/kg dm) were found at a peat depth of 10-15 cm which is estimated to correspond to a time period of 1976-1960 whereas the PAH profile showed a maximum (2853 mug Sigma PAHs/kg dm) at a depth of 20-25 cm which represents circa 1951-1930. Compared to these maxima, the concentrations of PAHs in the top layer (1990-1986) are six times lower, but the decline in PCBs is only 38%. The concentration profiles are generally consistent with known changes in contaminant emissions, and suggest that more detailed studies of ombrogenic peat bog profiles could be used for detailed reconstructions of the changing atmospheric fluxes of these and other organic contaminants.

AB Peatlands store one-third of global soil carbon(1). Drought/drainage coupled with climate warming present the main threat to these stores(1-4). Hence, understanding drought effects and inherent feedbacks related to peat decomposition has been a primary global challenge(5,6). However, widely divergent results concerning drought in recent studies(3,7-11) challenge the accepted paradigm that waterlogging and associated anoxia are the overarching controls locking up carbon stored in peat. Here, by linking field and microcosm experiments, we show how previously unrecognized mechanisms regulate the build-up of phenolics, which protects stored carbon directly by reducing phenol oxidase activity during short-term drought and, indirectly, through a shift from low-phenolic Sphagnum/herbs to high-phenolic shrubs after long-term moderate drought. We demonstrate that shrub expansion induced by drought/warming(2,6,10,12,13) in boreal peatlands might be a long-term self-adaptive mechanism not only increasing carbon sequestration but also potentially protecting historic soil carbon. We therefore propose that the projected 'positive feedback loop' between carbon emission and drought in peatlands(2,3,14,15) may not occur in the long term.

AB The establishment of biomass plantations with short-rotation forestry principles is one of the after-use options for cutaway peatlands. We studied biomass production and carbon sequestration in the above- and below-ground biomass of 25 naturally afforested, 10-30 years old downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) stands located in peat cutaway areas in Finland. Self-thinning reduced the stand density from 122,000 trees ha(-1) (stand age of 10 years) to 10,000 trees ha(-1) (25-30 years), while the leafless above-ground biomass increased from 17 Mg ha(-1) up to 79-116 Mg ha(-1). The total leafless biomass (including stumps and roots) varied from 46 to 151 Mg ha(-1). The mean annual increment (MAI) of the above-ground biomass increased up to the stand age of 15 years, after which the MAI was on the average 3.2 Mg ha(-1)a(-1). With below-ground biomass, the MAI of the stands older than 15 years was 4.7 Mg ha(-1). The organic matter accumulated in the O-layer on the top of the residual peat increased linearly with the stand age, reaching 29.3 Mg ha(-1) in the oldest stand. The O-layer contributed significantly to the C sink, and the afforestation with downy birch converted most of sites into C sinks.

ID WETLANDS; DYNAMICS; PEAT
AB This paper investigates the rates of peat accumulation associated with different phases in the succession from open water to carr forest in shallow ponds created by peat dredging in The Netherlands. Four phases had been recognized in a previous study of aerial photographs for the period 1937-1990, i.e. open water (Aq), reed swamp (SA), brownmoss quaking fen (BM) and carr forest (CF). Feat accumulation rates were estimated by relating the amounts of organic matter stored to the data on the successional history for 21 different sites.
   The organic matter accumulation rates were highest in the SA phase (1.12 kg m(-2) y(-1) on a dry weight basis), intermediate in the BM and CF phases (0.49 and 0.58 kg m(-2) y(-1)), and lowest in the Aq phase (0.26 kg m(-2) y(-1)). These values are high in comparison with values determined for fen ecosystems with stratigraphic methods in combination with radiocarbon dating. The accumulation rates were inversely related to the average duration of the successional phases, suggesting that peat accumulation is a major driving force behind the succession.

AB Peatlands drained for forestry have a high potential for CO2 emissions due to peat decomposition. Accurate estimates of either these emissions or soil carbon balances (Delta C-soil) on large areas are needed for national greenhouse gas inventories and as input for earth system models. The measurement of forest floor respiration (R-floor) or heterotrophic soil respiration (R-het) by portable chambers offers an affordable tool for extensive studies. So far, the reliability of respiration chamber based calculations of Delta C-soil, has not been tested and the prerequisites for their use have not been discussed. However, the method is being used in greenhouse gas inventories.
   In this study, we compared the results of two chamber based methods against a reference estimate based on eddy covariance measurements. In the first method, Delta C-soil was calculated by subtracting R-het from the litter input into the soil. In the second method, R floor was subtracted from the entire allocation of carbon (C) into the soil. A four-year detailed dataset of C dynamics of a drained peatland forest in southern Finland served as the test material.
   The R-het method produced results close to those of the reference method, but the results were sensitive to the choice of root turnover rates used in the estimation of litter input. The R-floor method resulted in a clear underestimation of soil C sink: the accurate estimation of the large photosynthesis and respiration fluxes needed for the calculation turned out to be difficult.
   In our opinion, the R-het method could be used to identify hot spots of forest soil CO2 emissions and for balance estimation for large areas. Further development of models for estimating the photosynthesis and respiration fluxes is needed for the application of the R-floor method. As the estimation of Delta C-soil by subtracting C output from C input is inherently sensitive to bias in the estimation of the input and output, the accuracy of both methods needs further testing with extensive datasets.

AB In peatlands, arsenite was reported to be effectively sequestered by sulfhydryl groups of natural organic matter. To which extent porewater arsenite can react with reduced sulfur to form thioarsenates and how this affects arsenic sequestration in peatlands is unknown. Here, we show that, in the naturally arsenic enriched peatland Gola di Lago, Switzerland, up to 93% of all arsenic species in surface and porewaters were thioarsenates. The dominant species, monothioarsenate, likely formed from arsenite and zerovalent sulfur-containing species. Laboratory incubations with sulfide-reacted, purified model peat showed increasing total arsenic sorption with decreasing pH from 8.5 to 4.5 for both, monothioarsenate and arsenite. However, Xray absorption spectroscopy revealed no binding of monothioarsenate via sulfhydryl groups. The sorption observed at pH 4.5 was acid-catalyzed dissociation of monothioarsenate, forming arsenite. The lower the pH and the more sulfhydryl sites, the more arsenite sorbed which in turn shifted equilibrium toward further dissociation of monothioarsenate. At pH 8.5, monothioarsenate was stable over 41 days. In conclusion, arsenic can be effectively sequestered by sulfhydryl groups in anoxic, slightly acidic environments where arsenite is the only arsenic species. At neutral to slightly alkaline pH, monothioarsenate can form and its slow transformation into arsenite and low affinity to sulfhydryl groups suggest that this species is mobile in such environments.

AB Northern regions are experiencing considerable climate change affecting the state of permafrost, peat accumulation rates, and the large pool of carbon (C) stored in soil, thereby emphasizing the importance of monitoring surface C fluxes in different landform sites along a climate gradient. We studied surface net C exchange (NCE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across different landforms (upland, peat plateau, collapse scar) in mid-boreal to high subarctic ecoregions in the Mackenzie Valley of northwestern Canada for three years. NCE and ER were measured using automatic CO2 chambers (ADC, Bioscientific LTD., Herts, England), and soil respiration (SR) was measured with solid state infrared CO2 sensors (Carbocaps, Vaisala, Vantaa, Finland) using the concentration gradient technique. Both NCE and ER were primarily controlled by soil temperature in the upper horizons. In upland forest locations, ER varied from 583 to 214 g C.m(-2).year(-1) from mid-boreal to high subarctic zones, respectively. For the bog and peat plateau areas, ER was less than half that at the upland locations. Of SR, nearly 75% was generated in the upper 5 cm layer composed of live bryophytes and actively decomposing fibric material. Our results suggest that for the upland and bog locations, ER significantly exceeded NCE. Bryophyte NCE was greatest in continuously waterlogged collapsed areas and was negligible in other locations. Overall, upland forest sites were sources of CO2 (from 64 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in the high subarctic to 588 g C.m(-2).year(-1) in mid-boreal zone); collapsed areas were sinks of C, especially in high subarctic (from 27 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in mid-boreal to 86 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in high subarctic) and peat plateaus were minor sources (from 153 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in mid-boreal to 6 g . C.m(-2).year(-1) in high subarctic). The results are important in understanding how different landforms are responding to climate change and would be useful in modeling the effect of future climate change on the soil C balance in the northern regions.

AB The Hamernia peat bog in the Roztocze region started to develop in the Allerod within the deflation basin divided into two sub-basins by a parabolic dune formed in the Older or the Oldest Dryas. Lithological and palynological analyses as well as radiocarbon dating of samples from three logs cored in different parts of the peat-bog indicate that up to the Subatlantic, when the top of the dune bar was inundated, the evolution of both sub-basins was different in hydrological and sedimentological aspects. Aeolian processes were active in the Younger Dryas, generating delivery of mineral material to both sub-basins. However, the intensiveness of this process was much lower than in earlier cold phases, as indicated by the limited spatial and temporal delivery of this material (restricted mainly to the wind-ward subbasin). The nature of the next short episode of mineral material delivery to one sub-basin, recorded during the climate cooling at the turn of the Boreal and the Atlantic Phases, is not clear. Local aeolian or slope processes (water erosion accompanied by mass movements) are suspected to be responsible for this episode. The youngest stage of slight but continuous mineral material delivery, caused by aeolian processes, started in the climate cooling at the beginning of the Subatlantic, and was contemporary with the intensification of human activity in this area. The geological history in the Late Vistulian and the Holocene suggests that the last dune-forming stage in this area occurred during the Older Dryas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB Continuous half-hourly net CO2 exchange measurements were made using nine automatic chambers in a treed fen in northern Alberta, Canada from June-October in 2005 and from May-October in 2006. The 2006 growing season was warmer and drier than in 2005. The average chamber respiration rates normalized to 10 degrees C were much higher in 2006 than in 2005, while calculations of the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) values were similar in the two years. Daytime average respiration values were lower than the corresponding, temperature-corrected respiration rates calculated from night-time chamber measurements. From June to September, the season-integrated estimates of chamber photosynthesis and respiration were 384 and 590 g C m-2, respectively in 2006, an increase of 100 and 203 g C m-2 over the corresponding values in 2005. The season-integrated photosynthesis and respiration rates obtained using the eddy covariance technique, which included trees and a tall shrub not present in the chambers, were 720 and 513 g C m-2, respectively, in 2006, an increase of 50 and 125 g C m-2 over the corresponding values in 2005. While both photosynthesis and respiration rates were higher in the warmer and drier conditions of 2006, the increase in respiration was more than twice the increase in photosynthesis.

AB C-13 natural abundance variations were measured in peat soil and vegetation from two contrasting boreal forest wetlands: an upland watershed basin and a permanently saturated lowland mire. Evidence of methane oxidation was shown in the permanently saturated wetland with deltaC-13 values as low as -97 parts per thousand in carbonate minerals found in floating peat mats. It is postulated that C-13 depleted CH4 is oxidized in the,mat and reacts with calcium ions to form calcite (identified through x-ray diffraction). Methane flux measurements during the summer of 1992 showed much lower fluxes in areas with floating peat mats relative to open water. Secondary carbonates in the        basin peat have isotope compositions close to the deltaC-13 values of the peat organic carbon (25 parts per thousand), indicating their origin from fermentation and possibly from sulfate-reduction. In the upland basin peat deposits, the deltaC-13(PDB) Values of organic C were constant with depth, while the permanently saturated mire had localities of C-13 enrichment in deeper layers of the peat. The C-13 enrichment may reflect areas of intense CH4 production in which C-13 enriched residual substrate is left behind during the production of highly C-13 depleted CH4.

AB Petrological and delta C-13 analyses were undertaken on contiguous specimens of coal and intercalated minor organic-rich clastic sediments collected from coal seams spanning the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary in the Alberta-and Saskatchewan portions of the Western Interior Basin. The generally high smectite content of the coal suggests that the original mires were largely small, disconnected, and rheotrophic, readily receiving abundant waterborne detrital clastic material of largely volcanic origin. Nevertheless, using the distinctive claystone that marks the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary as a regional datum, it is possible to correlate cycles in the vitrinite and inertinite composition of the coals over >500 km. Estimates of peat accumulation rates suggest that the cycles in vitrinite and inertinite composition represent regional, cyclic fluctuations in wildfire and oxidation of the peatlands and overlying canopy at a frequency of hundreds to thousands of years. The likely causes of these fluctuations were cyclic, regional-scale changes in temperature. The Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary event occurred early during a phase of gradually increasing temperature and/or decreasing rainfall, but peak wildfire and desiccation of peat occurred up to 14,000 yr later than the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, and the mires did not experience significant water stress in the immediate aftermath of the extinction event. A persistent, 1.5%-3.0% negative delta C-13 excursion occurs across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, but it cannot be readily separated from four, further negative excursions later in the earliest Danian. The negative carbon isotope excursion linked to the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary began a few hundred years before the event itself, and recovery occurred within 21 k.y., and possibly in as little as just a few thousand years, consistent with recently calibrated shallow-marine delta C-13 records. Hence, the atmospheric and surface ocean carbon pools were coupled at this time. The absence of evidence for catastrophic change in the climatic regime at the time of the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction in these mires supports the notion that the negative shift in atmospheric delta C-13 was brought about by changes in the delta C-13 composition of the surface ocean. This is consistent with the greater magnitude of extinction experienced by marine fauna relative to the terrestrial realm.

AB Two uppermost Triassic (Rhaetian) coal beds (A-and B-bed; Bjuv Member, southern Sweden) deposited at the margin of the Danish Basin were investigated in order to interpret the peat-forming environments in a sequence stratigraphic context and to establish the peat-forming vegetations of the precursor mires. Peat formed close to the coastline and was governed by base-level (watertable) rise linked to relative sea-level rise, which is emphasized by rare occurrences of marine phytoplankton, Micrhystridium, Lunnomidinium scaniense and Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica, in the B-bed. A maximum flooding surface (MFS7) between the coal beds A and B shows that peat accumulation occurred as a coastal response to the continued transgression of the Danish Basin that culminated with deposition of the coal-bearing Bjuv Member. The lower B-bed accumulated in a transgressive systems tract (TST) and the upper A-bed in a highstand systems tract (HST). The B-bed consists of coal and coaly mudstone intervals showing that peat formation repeatedly was outpaced by relative watertable rise. The huminite-rich coal intervals indicate peat formation under oxygen-deficient stagnant water conditions, where the peat accumulation rate balanced the watertable rise. Overall low TS values indicate a freshwater mire. The base of coal bed B marks the start of a relative decrease in creation of accommodation space, and the surface between the sediments and coal bed B represents a Terrestrialisation Surface (TeS). The palynofloral composition suggests that the initial mire was characterised by dipterid/dicksoniacean tree ferns and marattialean ground ferns, and few canopy trees dominated by cupressacean/taxodiacean wet-loving conifers with subordinate bennettitalean and caytonialean trees. The coal intervals in the B-bed represent Terrestrialisation situations characterised by a reduced ratio of accommodation rate/peat accumulation rate. The palynology of these intervals indicates establishment of canopy trees, primarily cupressacean/taxodiacean conifers accompanied by bennettitaleans and caytonialeans, with an understory of marattialean ground ferns and rarer tree ferns. Flooding Surfaces (FS) and Accommodation Reversal Surfaces (ARS) in the B-bed reflect changes in the rate of watertable rise. The coaly mudstone intervals represent Paludification situations with an upward increasing ratio of accommodation rate/peat accumulation rate. In general the palynology of the B-bed suggests a coal floral composition that was dominated by mid and upper canopy plants consisting of cuperessaceaen/taxodiaceaen trees, probably occupying areas with standing water, while ginkgos, cycads, Bennettiales, and Caytoniales and other seed ferns grew in less wet areas. Understory plants were less abundant, whereas a ground cover of ferns, mainly of the families Marattiales and Osmundales, as well as lycophytes may have been pronounced. The upper surface of the B-bed is a Give-up Transgressive Surface (GUTS) above which peat accumulation was replaced by siliciclastic deposition. The palynofloral composition suggests an open-mire dominated by ground ferns and probable tree ferns, with minor bennettitalean and caytonialean mid canopy trees, and with hardly any upper canopy trees. The A-bed is considerably richer in inertinite compared to the B-bed. The palynofloral and petrographic change correlates with an increase in fire activity across the Triassic Jurassic boundary and deforestation of the Early Jurassic mires. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) is the most powerful reactive oxygen species that plays a critical role in the fate of redox-active substances. Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems with highly reduced substances and ubiquitous redox interfaces. However, little is known about the production of center dot OH during the reoxidation of peatlands under waterlogged conditions. Here, we conduct a set of reoxidation experiments using waterlogged peat soil dominated by various vegetation species and monitored center dot OH production. The results show that the cumulative concentrations of center dot OH produced within 24 h upon oxygenation of waterlogged peat samples are 307-840 mmol g(-1). The main factors affecting the production of center dot OH include an acidic environment, abundant reduced dissolved organic matter and Fe(II). In addition, center dot OH production enhances laccase activity (the largest class of phenol oxidases in the soil) by 7.7% similar to 20.4% and increases soil respiration by 3.17% similar to 23.67% during the reoxidation of the waterlogged peat samples. In addition, the simulation experiments confirm that center dot OH can promote laccase activity directly by serving as an electron acceptor and indirectly by oxidizing substrates. Both mechanisms are greater than the effect of oxygen (O-2) alone on laccase activity. Our results indicate a new induction mechanism for enhancing laccase activity by center dot OH when subjected to anoxic-oxic interface fluctuations, which is particularly important for carbon cycling in peatlands because it can break the decomposition latch and can further promote soil organic carbon mineralization.

AB Geomorphological controls and catchment sediment characteristics control the formation of floodplains and affect their capacity to sequester carbon. Organic carbon stored in floodplains is typically a product of pedogenic development between periods of mineral sediment deposition. However, in organically-dominated upland catchments with a high sediment load, eroded particulate organics may also be fluvially deposited with potential for storage and/or oxidation. Understanding the redistribution of terrestrial carbon laterally, beyond the bounds of river channels is important, especially in eroding peatland systems where fluvial particulate organic carbon exports are often assumed to be oxidised. Floodplains have the potential to be both carbon cycling hotspots and areas of sequestration. Understanding of the interaction of carbon cycling and the sediment cascade through floodplain systems is limited. This paper examines the formation of highly organic floodplains downstream of heavily eroded peatlands in the Peak District, UK. Reconstruction of the history of the floodplains suggests that they have formed in response to periods of erosion of organic soils upstream. We present a novel approach to calculating a carbon stock within a floodplain, using XRF and radiograph data recorded during Itrax core scanning of sediment cores. This carbon stock is extrapolated to the catchment scale, to assess the importance of these floodplains in the storage and cycling of organic carbon in this area. The carbon stock estimate for the floodplains across the contributing catchments is between 3482-13460 tonnes, equating on an annualised basis to 0.8-4.5% of the modern-day POC flux. Radiocarbon analyses of bulk organic matter in floodplain sediments revealed that a substantial proportion of organic carbon was associated with re-deposited peat and has been used as a tool for organic matter source determination. The average age of these samples (3010 years BP) is substantially older than Infrared Stimulated Luminesence dating which demonstrated that the floodplains formed between 430 and 1060 years ago. Our data suggest that floodplains are an integral part of eroding peatland systems, acting as both significant stores of aged and eroded organic carbon and as hotspots of carbon turnover.

AB Accumulation records of pollutant metals in peat have been frequently used to reconstruct past atmospheric deposition rates. While there is good support for peat as a record of relative changes in metal deposition over time, questions remain whether peat archives represent a quantitative or a qualitative record. Several processes can potentially influence the quantitative record of which downwashing is particularly pertinent as it would have a direct influence on how and where atmospherically deposited metals are accumulated in peat. The aim of our study was two-fold: first, to compare and contrast the retention of dissolved Pb, Cu, Zn and Ni in peat cores; and second, to test the influence of different precipitation intensities on the potential downwashing of metals. We applied four 'rainfall' treatments to 13 peat cores over a 3-week period, including both daily (2 or 5.3 mm day(-1)) and event-based additions (37 mm day(-1), added over 1 h or over a 10 h rain event). Two main trends were apparent: 1) there was a difference in retention of the added dissolved metals in the surface layer (0-2 cm): 21-85% for Pb, 18-63% for Cu, 10-25% for Zn and 10-20% for Ni. 2) For all metals and both peat types (sphagnum lawn and fen), the addition treatments resulted in different downwashing depths, i.e., as the precipitation-addition increased so did the depth at which added metals could be detected. Although the largest fraction of Pb and Cu was retained in the surface layer and the remainder effectively immobilized in the upper peat (<= 10 cm), there was a smearing effect on the overall retention, where precipitation intensity exerts an influence on the vertical distribution of added trace metals. These results indicate that the relative position of a deposition signal in peat records would be preserved, but it would be quantitatively attenuated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands are among the most important sources of atmospheric CH4, but the size of this source remains highly uncertain. We developed a biogeophysical model called CH4MOD(wetland) to assess CH4 emissions from natural wetlands. The model adopted the rationale of CH4MOD that simulates CH4 emission from irrigated rice paddies, and focused on the supply of methanogenic substrates in natural wetlands that differ from the supply in the rice paddy. CH4MOD(wetland) was validated against independent field measurements of CH4 emissions from different wetland sites, including marshland in the Sanjiang Plain (northeast China), peatland in the Ruoergan Plateau (southwest China), fen in Saskatchewan (Canada) and bogs in Michigan (USA). Model validation showed that CH4MOD(wetland) is generally capable of simulating the seasonal and interannual variations in CH4 emission from different sites, while it overestimated CH4 emissions from the bog vegetated with Carex oligosperma in Michigan for 2 out of 3 years. Further investigation by running a different model (Wetland-DNDC) showed similar outcomes for the latter case. The simulated seasonal and/or annual amounts of CH4 emissions at different sites agreed with the observed results and yielded an R-2 of 0.84 (n = 14). The root mean-squared error, mean deviation and model efficiency were 29.7%, -11.8% and 0.79, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of the model suggested that the standing water depth of the wetland and the air temperature could significantly affect CH4 emissions. We conclude that, in general, the CH4MOD(wetland) model can simulate CH4 emissions from wetlands under various conditions (climate, soil and plant species). Further improvements of CH4MOD(wetland) should focus on the enhancement of its descriptive power for key processes, as well as on its re-calibration and verification using spatiotemporal measurements across a wider domain so that it can be more applicable to various wetlands.

AB Agricultural peatlands are essential for a myriad of ecosystem functions and play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle through C sequestration. Management of these agricultural peatlands takes place at different spatial scales, ranging from local to landscape management, and drivers of soil microbial community structure and function may be scale-dependent. Effective management for an optimal biogeochemical functioning thus requires knowledge of the drivers on soil microbial community structure and functioning, as well as the spatial scales upon which they are influenced. During two field campaigns, we examined the importance of different drivers (i.e., soil characteristics, nutrient management, vegetation composition) at two spatial scales (local vs. landscape) for, respectively, the soil microbial community structure (determined by PLFA) and soil microbial community functional capacity (as assessed by CLPP) in agricultural peatlands. First, we show by an analysis of PLFA profiles that the total microbial biomass changes with soil moisture and relative C:P nutrient availability. Secondly, we showed that soil communities are controlled by a distinct set of drivers at the local, as opposed to landscape, scale. Community structure was found to be markedly different between areas, in contrast to community function which showed high variability within areas. We further found that microbial structure appears to be controlled more at a landscape scale by nutrient-related variables, whereas microbial functional capacity is driven locally through plant community feedbacks. Optimal management strategies within such peatlands should therefore consider the scale-dependent action of soil microbial community drivers, for example by first optimizing microbial structure at the landscape scale by targeted areal management, and then optimizing soil microbial function by local vegetation management.

AB Naturally-ignited wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity in northern regions, contributing to rapid permafrost thaw-induced landscape change driven by climate warming. Low-severity wildfires typically result in minor organic matter loss. The impacts of such fires on the hydrological and geochemical dynamics of peat plateau-wetland complexes have not been examined. In 2014, a low-severity wildfire, with minimal ground surface damage, burned approximately one-half of a 5 ha permafrost plateau in the wetland-dominated landscape of the Scotty Creek watershed, Northwest Territories, Canada, in the discontinuous permafrost zone. In March 2016, hydrometeorological and permafrost conditions on the burned and unaffected plateaus were monitored including snowpack characteristics and surface energy dynamics. Pore water samples were collected from the saturated layer as thaw progressed throughout the growing season on the burned and unaffected plateaus. Repeated probing of the frost table depth was coupled with laboratory analyses of peat physical and hydraulic characteristics performed on peat cores collected from the top 20 cm of the ground surface in the burned and unaffected plots. The higher transmissivity of the burned forest canopy accelerated snowmelt promoting earlier onset of the thawing season and increased the ground heat flux to melt ground ice. Wildfire increased the thickness of the supra-permafrost layer, including the active layer and talik, resulting in a more uniform subsurface with limited depressional storage capacity and reduced preferential runoff flowpaths across the burned plateau. The incorporation of ash and char into the peat matrix reduced pore diameters, promoting greater subsurface soil moisture retention and longer pore water residence times ultimately providing greater opportunity for soil water interaction and biogeochemical reactions. Consequently, pore water showed elevated dissolved solutes, dissolved organic matter and mercury concentrations in the burned site. Low-severity wildfires have the potential to trigger a series of complex, inter-related hydrological, thermal and biogeochemical processes and feedbacks. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrology is central to the formation, growth and utilisation of peat soils. However, peat presents a difficult medium in which to measure hydrologic properties, due to its soft structure and high water content. The von Post scale is a widely used measure of the extent of decomposition of peat, which can be applied in the field or the laboratory without specialised equipment. von Post decomposition has been shown to correlate with hydraulic conductivity. However, it is a categorical and subjective measure of decomposition. Technological advances now enable peat chemistry to be described quantitatively and objectively. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is now routinely used to describe peat chemistry, and the capability of this technique has been extended by the development of the molecular mixing model (MMM). The MMM predicts the molecular composition of organic material from the spectral information provided by C-13 NMR. We found significant relationships between the hydrologic properties hydraulic conductivity and water yield and peat chemistry as described by C-13 NMR and the MMM. These relationships have potential application in all fields where the hydrologic properties of peat soils are of interest (i.e. peat mining, peatland restoration, catchment management) and also in modelling of peatland development and responses to climate change.

AB The peat bog at Homorodszentpal Kerek-to (Round Lake), situated in Homorod Hills of the Eastern Carpathians in Romania, provides a continuous record of paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental changes from the Early Holocene. In this study, we present a 7500-year-long high-resolution record of past climatic changes and signs of human impact recorded in a peat bog via integrating sedimentological, paleoecological and geochemical proxies. The basin of Round Lake formed around the Pleistocene-Holocene border when the permafrost thawed. Ponded water accumulated in the catchment basin from the beginning of the Holocene but ca. 7500 cal BP years ago lacustrine sedimentation was exchanged for peat accumulation. The 570-cm-long core was subsampled at 2-4 cm intervals and subjected to grain-size, loss-on-ignition (LOI), pollen, and radiocarbon (C-14) analyses. Our findings were correlated with and interpreted in the light of paleobotanical records deriving from archaeological sites and the newest bioclimatological models of the nearby areas. Sedimentological analysis document erosion and accumulation events which were influenced by more complex processes like climate change. Based on environmental historical and climatic data we aimed to reconstruct the environmental changes of forested areas in the Homorodi Hills.

AB QuestionRe-wetting drained peatlands is a common restoration method to reduce carbon loss, but little is known on its likely consequences on reproductive plant development, especially in a warming world. Thus, the aim of this study was to test whether the phenological development of plant species in a peatland ecosystem changed with higher temperatures, increased water table level or a combination of the two.
   LocationFen peatland site in Bavaria, Germany.
   MethodsIn 2010, manipulative experiments with two different treatments (control and warming) and in 2011 with four different treatments (control, warming, increased water table level, warming + increased water table level) were conducted. Temperature was raised 0.4-1.5 degrees C with open-top chambers (OTCs) from August 2009 onwards, and water table level was elevated 12cm using a pumping system, however the latter was not continuous for the whole growing season of 2011 due to technical difficulties. Phenological development of different grassland species was observed weekly using the BBCH code. Attention focused on reproductive phenology (from flower development to fruit senescence) and on key single phenological phases, such as flower development, flowering, ripening and fruit senescence, as well as the duration of key phases. Additionally, vegetation height was measured.
   ResultsOur study showed that higher temperatures advanced reproductive phenology and most key phases, except fruit senescence. Water table manipulations had no significant influence on phenology. The duration of key phases was generally not significantly influenced by treatments, whereas vegetation height differed between control and higher temperature plots.
   ConclusionIn general, raising the water table to reduce carbon release from drained peatland sites will not dramatically affect phenological development of grassland species, whereas increased temperatures will affect reproductive phenology.

It is shown that the most significant changes of mineralization of bog waters caused by the inflow of industrial waste waters from oil and gas production enterprises are referred to the high layer with a thickness of approximately 0.5-1.0 m. The creation of loam as an insulating barrier in the active layer of the bog helps reduce the negative impact on the waters, but does not preserve their baseline state on the lower layer.

AB Abstract
   Understanding the effects of warming on greenhouse gas feedbacks to climate change represents a major global challenge. Most research has focused on direct effects of warming, without considering how concurrent changes in plant communities may alter such effects. Here, we combined vegetation manipulations with warming to investigate their interactive effects on greenhouse gas emissions from peatland. We found that although warming consistently increased respiration, the effect on net ecosystem CO2 exchange depended on vegetation composition. The greatest increase in CO2 sink strength after warming was when shrubs were present, and the greatest decrease when graminoids were present. CH4 was more strongly controlled by vegetation composition than by warming, with largest emissions from graminoid communities. Our results show that plant community composition is a significant modulator of greenhouse gas emissions and their response to warming, and suggest that vegetation change could alter peatland carbon sink strength under future climate change.

AB Much attention has been given to the carbon balance of peatland and heathland ecosystems and their role as global carbon stores. They are also important as buffers for atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution, locking N into the soil and vegetation through tight nutrient cycling and preventing the leaching of soluble N into freshwater ecosystems. We compared mean annual soil exchangeable N, mineralisation and soil solution nitrogen at three contrasting ericaceous-dominated ecosystems: a lowland heath, an upland heath and an ombrotrophic raised bog at intermediate altitude, all of which were sites of long-term N-manipulation experiments. We expected that soil leachate N would be associated with soil C/N and total soil C, and that sites with higher C % and soil C/N would have greater ability to buffer N deposition before N saturation and leaching began. However, although soil solution N responded to N deposition at all the sites, we found that only the heathland sites were consistent with this expectation. The bog, with the highest C/N and largest C pool, was not the most strongly buffered. The upland heath was most effective at retaining N (extractable NH4+-N +3900 % from control) compared to the lowland heath (extractable NH4+-N +370 % from control) and the bog (extractable NH4+-N, +140-240 % from control). We concluded that the absence of a definable Calluna litter layer at the lowland heath and the bog, and the anoxic conditions at the bog, explained the earlier onset of leaching and that carbon and nitrogen cycles appeared more closely coupled in the heathlands but became decoupled at the bog due to the strong controlling effect of hydrology.

AB Blanket peat on hillslopes in the British Isles is known to be susceptible to mass movements. A few such peat landslides had also been reported from southern hemisphere islands with climates that favour the formation of blanket bogs. Previous studies of peat landslides on subantarctic islands are re-examined to address two primary hypotheses: (i) that landslides in blanket peat are primarily controlled by natural intrinsic thresholds, and (ii) that the general characteristics and failure mechanisms of the peat landslides on subantarctic islands do not differ significantly from British and Irish examples. Peat slides on Macquarie Island and Marion Island are analysed to establish whether quantitative comparisons can be made with the stability of blanket peat in Ireland. The inventory surveys of the subantarctic islands indicate that there may be several hundred peat landslides, perhaps three times more than in the British Isles. They appear to be common because of the combined effects of several factors including the constituent vegetation and the frequent moderate rainfall that promotes formation of smooth, impermeable iron and organic pans at the base of the peat. The absence of intense convective rainfall, droughts and anthropogenic disturbance leads to the conclusion that the failures result from peat accumulation reaching natural maximum thicknesses with respect to intrinsic stability thresholds. Different vegetation on different slopes seems to influence the shear strength of blanket peat on Macquarie Island, and in general the subantarctic peat landslides are shown to be visually similar but quantitatively different from Irish examples.

AB Easter Island is a paradigmatic example of human impact on ecosystems. The role of climate changes in recent vegetation shifts has commonly been rejected without proper assessment. A palynological study of a long sediment core from Raraku Lake documents the vegetation dynamics for the last 341 a and investigates their driving forces, particularly the effects of climate variability on vegetation changes. Significant relationships between pollen assemblage changes and sedimentary and geochemical proxies demonstrate the rapid response of vegetation to lake crater basin hydrology and climatic changes. The lake surroundings were occupied by an open mixed palm grove during the Last Glacial period. Poaceae and Sophora increased at the expense of palms and Triumfetta, and Coprosma practically disappeared, in response to slightly wetter and/or colder climate during the Last Glacial Maximum. Palms and Triumfetta thrived in a warmer and/or drier climate during the deglaciation. Minor vegetation changes (a slight increase in Sophora and a drop in Asteraceae and Poaceae) occurred between 13.2 and 11.8 cal Ica BP and can be related to rapid changes in the Younger Dryas chronozone. The increase in herbaceous taxa indicates a gradual shallowing of the lake and development of a mire during the Holocene, caused by sediment infilling and warmer and drier climate. Relatively rapid vegetation changes in the Holocene were caused by climate and by plant succession on the expanding mire. The rates of vegetation change observed in the mire were similar to those at the initial stages of human impact identified in a previous study. These results reveal significant vegetation changes prior to human presence, due to the interplay of climate variations (temperature and moisture), changes in lake basin form by infilling and intrinsic dynamics of plant succession. Hence, the potential contribution of these factors in vegetation shifts during the period of human presence should not be neglected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seasonal growth of black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. BSP) and tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) roots in an Alberta peatland were assessed by measuring growth into emplaced soil cores that did not contain plant roots. Five cores were positioned 1 m from the base of each tree and 10 replicates of this treatment were used for each species. Sequential lifting of these cores during the growing season showed that root growth by these species did not begin until midsummer. Tamarack root growth was restricted to August and September, while black spruce root growth continued into October.

AB Humic substances (HS) belong to the most powerful complex-forming agents, significantly affecting major and trace element speciation in natural environment. Several authors have focused on humic-metal interactions, using differing methods and comparing humic substances on different sources. However, the intrinsic differences among the HS of different origin and the impact of humification degree on the complex formation between humic substances and metals have not received the necessary attention until now.
   The aim of this study is to determine the Cu(II) complexing capacity and stability constants of Cu(II) complexes of humic acids (HA) isolated from two well-characterized raised bog peat profiles in respect to the basic properties and humification characteristics of the studied peats and their humic acids. Elemental and functional analysis of the isolated HA were determined by elemental composition (C, H, N, O), UV spectrophotometry, and the total acidity method, as well as the copper (Cu2+) ion selective electrode was used in complexing analysis of humic acids and metal ions.
   The complex stability constants are within the range of stability constants of the humic substances isolated from other sources (soil, coal, water, and peat). The complex stability constants significantly changed within the bog profiles and are well correlated with the age and the degree of peat decomposition.
   A comparison of the complex stability constant and the actual copper concentration in peat humic acids shows significant correlation, indicating the importance of tight metal binding for the actual presence of metal in peat and peat humic acids. None of the basic characteristics of humic acids (concentration of carboxylic groups and total acidity, hydrophobicity, etc.) alone can fully explain the complex-forming capacity of humic acids, which suggests a contribution of other factors that are yet to be determined.

AB Elevated nitrogen (N) input may reduce carbon (C) storage in peat. Under low atmospheric deposition, most N is bound in the moss layer. Under high N inputs, Sphagnum is not able to prevent penetration of dissolved N to deeper peat. Nitrogen may become available to the roots of invading vascular plants. The concurrent oxygenation of deeper peat layers, along with higher supply of labile organic C, may enhance microbial decomposition and lead to peat thinning. The resulting higher emissions of greenhouse gases may accelerate global warming. Seepage of N to deeper peat has never been quantified. Here we present evidence for post-depositional mobility of atmogenic N in peat, based on natural-abundance N isotope ratios. We conducted a reciprocal peat transplant experiment between two Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs in the Czech Republic (Central Europe), differing in anthropogenic N inputs. The northern site VJ received as much as 33 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) via spruce canopy throughfall. The southern site was less polluted (17.6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Isotope signatures of living moss differed between the two sites (delta N-15 of -3 parts per thousand and -7 parts per thousand at VJ and CB, respectively). After 18 months, an isotope mass balance was constructed. In the CB-to-VJ transplant, a significant portion of original CB nitrogen (98-31%) was removed and replaced by nitrogen of the host site throughout the top 10 cm of the profile. Nitrogen, deposited at VJ, was immobilized in imported CB peat that was up to 20 years old. Additionally, we compared N concentration and N accumulation rates in Pb-210-dated peat profiles with well-constrained data on historical atmospheric N pollution. Nationwide N emissions peaked in 1990, while VJ exhibited the highest N content in peat that formed in 1930. This de-coupling of N inputs and N retention in peat might be interpreted as a result of translocation of dissolved pollutant N downcore, corroborating our delta N-15 results at VJ and CB. Data from a variety of peat bogs along pollution and climatic gradients would be needed to test to what extent the record of atmospheric N inputs in peat is overprinted by variable, locally-controlled decomposition rates.

AB Black spruce seedspot and broadcast seeding experiments were completed on peatlands at four locations in northestern Ontario.  Poorly decomposed Sphagnum peat was the best seedbed for black spruce, with establishment ratios from 20 to 50 seedlings per 100 seeds sown.  An effective seeding rate (actual seeding rate X receptive seedbed area fraction) of six or seven seeds per quadrat is required to obtain quadrat stocking of 80% or greater.  Fifth-year seedling heights averaged from 8 to 17 cm.  Black spruce advance growth is often an important source of regeneration on peatlands and must be considered in developing seeding prescriptions.

AB Grasslands in the Kulawa river valley (ca. 10 ha) were subject to land improvement in the 19(th) century, and remnants of the hydrotechnical system and overgrown ditches are still present. This study aims to:
   (1) evaluate the present meadow ecosystems;
   (2) predict their changes under the influence of the planned restoration of the hydrotechnical system and
   (3) compare results of various methods: phytoindication, phytosociological, floristic, and principal component analysis.
   The applied methods complemented one another. The devastation of the hydrotechnical system and the lack of utilization of the grasslands have led to either drying or waterlogging of the soil, and to changes in vegetation. The plant communities that have developed there represent the intermediate stage of regressive succession, and belong to the orders Arrhenatheretalia, Molinietalia, and the class Phragmitetea. Particularly the patches growing on relatively dry, strongly decomposed peaty soil have lost the characteristics of damp meadows. Meadow species have declined there, and nitrophilous species have replaced them. Only a local depression without outflow, which was earlier drained, is now waterlogged again, with a mosaic of calcareous fen, meadow, and marsh vegetation, including large populations of 11 species that are rare, protected, or listed as indicator species for the Natura 2000 habitat 7210*. Results of this study indicate that the present conditions in the waterlogged depression should be preserved. In contrast, the dry patches should be irrigated and subject to extensive farming.

AB Vegetation and climate changes during the Last Glacial through to the late Holocene are identified by pollen analysis of a core from Lake Tangonge in far northern New Zealand. During the earliest part of the record (> 50 ka), regional vegetation was dominated by podocarp-hardwood forest. The most important tall podocarp trees were Dacrydium cupressinum and Dacryearpus dacrydioides. Knightia and Metrosideros sp. were common, and angiosperm elements dominated lowland/coastal forests. The cool, moist climates, of what may be equated to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4, were followed by a much wetter and slightly warmer period during MIS 3b (59-43 ka) when Ascarina became more abundant along with Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Metrosideros sp., Quintinia and Syzygium maire. From ca. 43 to 24 ka (MIS 3a) Agathis australis -dominated, mixed, conifer-hardwood forest expanded and hardy podocarps, Podocarpus and Prumnopitys taxifiblia, became more abundant. Ascarina lucida was scarce. Climates characterised by drier summers and cooler winters became increasingly colder, drier and windier, particularly from ca. 30 ka. Replacement of Agathis australis-podocarp-hardwood forest with Fuscospora-podocarp-hardwood forest followed rapidly, and by the Last Glacial Maximum Northland forests as far north as ca. 35 degrees S were dominated by Fuscospora. Bog vegetation burned frequently. Regional temperatures may have been depressed by as much as 3-3.5 degrees C below those of today, and rainfall was probably reduced by about two-thirds. Warm, moist elements expanded in the late glacial as the glacial-type flora became increasingly restricted. Changes in forest composition progressed even more rapidly from the onset of the Holocene. Across the far northern region, Fuscospora -dominated podocarp hardwood forest was rapidly replaced by Agathis australis-podocarp-hardwood forest. Fuscospora declined sharply and Dacrydium cupressinum dominated regional forests. Hardy podocarps became less common than previously, and Ascarina reached its greatest abundance between ca. 10 and 7.6 ka. The early Holocene climate was probably the warmest and most equable for the past 100 ka and temperatures in the Kaitaia region may have been 1-2 degrees C warmer than present. The mid-to-late Holocene (5-2 ka) is characterised by the decline of Ascarina, and the increased abundance of Manoao colensoi, Podocarpus and Prumnopitys taxifolia. Climates were probably slightly cooler and drier during this time as a more seasonal, dry summer/wet, cool winter regime prevailed. Increased cyclonic activity is suggested during this time.

AB Peatlands are important reservoirs of carbon (C) but our understanding of C cycling on cutover peatlands is limited. We investigated the decomposition over 18 months of five types of plant litter (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Picea sitchensis and Sphagnum auriculatum) at a cutover peatland in Scotland, at three water tables. We measured changes in C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the litter and used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to investigate changes in fungal community composition. The C content of S. auriculatum litter did not change throughout the incubation period whereas vascular plant litters lost 30-40% of their initial C. There were no differences in C losses between low and medium water tables, but losses were always significantly less at the high water table. Most litters accumulated N and E. angustifolium accumulated significant quantities of P. C, N and P were significant explanatory variables in determining changes in fungal community composition but explained < 25% of the variation. Litter type was always a stronger factor than water table in determining either fungal community composition or turnover of C, N and P in litter. The results have implications for the ways restoration programmes and global climate change may impact upon nutrient cycling in cutover peatlands.

AB Soil microbes favour easily decomposable organic compounds, and, consequently, soil organic matter tends to enrich with recalcitrant carbon compounds. In theory, this leads to an increasing temperature sensitivity of decomposition towards older fractions of soil organic matter. We tested this theory in a Sphagnum peat profile. This profile was particularly suitable for this purpose because the age of organic matter increased with depth. The age correlated closely with the degree of decomposition in the oxic layer and soil minerals did not interfere with the relationship between the age and the temperature sensitivity of decomposition. We sampled and analysed the peat profile by layer. We took laboratory measurements of chemical characteristics, decomposability and temperature sensitivity of decomposition. We used the bomb-C-14 isotopic tracer to differentiate the sources of respired CO2 into age-classes and to estimate the temperature sensitivity of the oldest fraction in each layer. We also used the natural abundance ratio of stable carbon isotopes as an indicator of the recalcitrance of the decomposing carbon fraction. The measurements showed that the decomposition of the older and more recalcitrant carbon compounds was enhanced more in response to increasing temperature than was the decomposition of the younger and more labile compounds. Our results support the theory tested and indicate that the temperature sensitivity of decomposition increases with depth, age and recalcitrance in the oxic layer of the studied peat profile.

AB The global loss of peatlands, by drainage or peat extraction, has encouraged measures to restore these ecosystems and their function as carbon sinks. However, there is a potential of high emissions of the potent greenhouse gas CH4 from restored peatlands. Vascular plants, which often dominate restored sites, play a key role in determining the amount of emitted CH4: The plants can either fuel methanogenesis by supplying labile carbon or attenuate methanogenesis by transferring oxygen into the rhizosphere. To quantify the net effect of these counteracting processes, we tested in a two-pronged approach CH4 production, emission, and the underlying processes in (1.) monoliths of three different restored cutover peatlands and in (2.) mesocosms with Eriophorwn vaginatwn, E. angustifolium and Juncos effusus versus controls with Sphagna and bare peat. Despite waterlogged, and thus persisting anoxic conditions, concentrations of dissolved CH4 remained close to zero in all tested monoliths. We ascribe this finding to two factors: The poor decomposability of the peat material, as determined in anoxic incubations, and the availability of alternative electron acceptors that sustained anaerobic respiration and competitively suppressed methanogenesis. While inorganic electron acceptor pools were small and rapidly diminished, dissolved organic matter provided constant electron acceptor capacity, indicating that reducible moieties in the organic matter were continuously re-oxidized in the rhizosphere of all tested vascular plant species. This continuous re-oxidation of the dissolved organic matter correlated with plant growth rates (R-2 = 0.6-0.8), suggesting that supply of oxygen through the aerenchyma of plant roots regenerated electron acceptor capacity in the rhizosphere. Vascular plants may have differential effects on the net ecosystem exchange, however, our findings suggest that CH4 concentrations and emissions may remain low in restored cutover peatlands for months to years. Thus, waterlogging and vascular plant cover of degraded cutover peat lands does not necessarily create hot-spots of CH4 emissions.

AB Mofidpoor, M., Krzic, M. and Principe, L. 2009. Effects of peat source and length of storage time in bales on selected properties of Sphagnum peat. Can. J. Soil Sci. 89: 635-644. Peat is a common ingredient of growing media used in the horticultural industry in North America and Europe, yet Canada does not have formal standards for peat quality assessment. This Study evaluated selected properties of baled peat as affected by peat source and length of storage time under conditions typically occurring at a commercial growing media firm. Nine bales of peat (dominated by fibric white peat) from the upper, less-decomposed layers of a Sphagnum bog in Manitoba in the early stage of exploitation (ESE) and nine bales of peat (dominated by hemic brown peat) from the lower, more-decomposed layers of a Sphagnum bog in Alberta in the late stage of exploitation (LSE), were sampled after 1, 3, and 10 mo of storage. The ESE peat had a larger particle size (determined by both dry and wet sieving), and a higher content of total elements (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo, Al, As, Cd, Co, Na, Ni, Pb, and Si), water content, and NH4-N than the LSE peat. The LSE peat had higher pH and NO3-N content. Plant-available water, air-filled porosity, and the number of germinated weeds were similar in ESE and LSE peat. In both sources of peat, organic particle size (determined by wet sieving) was lower after 10 mo of storage relative to 1 and 3 mo of storage. Similarly, the NH4-N content decreased from 120 mg kg(-1) after I mo of storage to 90 mg kg(-1) after 10 mo of storage. Hence, the growing media industry should monitor particle size distribution and available N at the time when peat is incorporated into growing mixes.

LA English
DT Article
AB The distribution of 41 testacean species (Protozoa: Rhizopoda) and a rotifer, Habrotrocha angusticollis (Rotifera: Bdelloidea) was analyzed in relation to 12 environmental variables by multivariate numerical techniques. Statistical analyses were performed using absolute numbers of testaceans estimated from 90 representative microsite types in six mires in the raised bog region of southern Finland.
   Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and both indirect (DCA) and direct (CCA) gradient analysis indicated that individual testaceans and certain assemblages of testaceans were dependent upon more than a single environmental factor, with soil moisture content being the most important. In microsite types where soil moisture content was not strongly affecting testaceans, the trophic status and DOC of the water proved to be important.
   The 12 environmental variables included in our survey accounted for 69.1 % of the total variance according to the CCA-ordination. In decreasing order of importance were depth of water table, soil moisture content, trophic status of the site, C/N ratio of the peat, water pH, depth of testacean sample, and DOC of water.
   The agglomerative cluster analysis by means of VAN DER MAAREL'S similarity index recognized nine testacean groups, which are comparable to groups identified by TWINSPAN along ecological gradients from dry to wet and from oligotrophic to eutrophic microsites.

AB Wetlands have not gained as much attention as they ought to by geologists despite being so prevalent in the Canadian landscape. Some of this stems from a poor understanding of wetland geology and what wetland landforms are. Wetlands constitute unusual landforms in that they are formed of biological material predominantly shaped by biological processes rather than being formed of minerals and rock shaped more by physical processes. There are two main groups of wetlands: mineral wetlands, commonly situated in high-energy settings; and peatlands, situated in low-energy settings that undergo either terrestrialization or paludification during the course of their development.
   Wetlands, as both a landscape unit and economic resource, have historically been and will continue to be important in Canada. New and more specialized skills and engineering designs will be required to build infrastructure in wetland terrain. Wetlands should be regarded as an economic resource that requires wise use and management. Nature-sensitive technologies need to be invented for use with wetlands to conserve and enhance the resource to serve the needs and protect the health of human society

AB This study has estimated the long term evaporation record for a peat covered catchment in northern England. In this study, 19 years of daily evaporation were estimated for rain-free periods using White's methods. Net radiation was measured over the study period; soil heat flux was calculated from temperature profiles; and sensible heat flux was calculated assuming the energy budget was closed. The calculated time series was compared to available environmental information on the same time step and over the same time period. Over a 19-year period it was possible to calculate 1662 daily evaporation rates (26% of the period). The study showed that the energy flux to net primry productivity was a small, long-term sink of energy but this sink was a virtue of high carbon accumulation in peat catchments: in catchments where there is no long-term dry matter accumulation, net primary productivity must be a small net source of energy. The study showed that evaporation increased over the study period whilst sensible heat flux significantly declined, reflecting an increased use of sensible heat energy to meet evaporative demand. The relatively small change in evaporative flux compared to other energy fluxes suggests that this system is a "near-equilibrium" system and not a "far-from-equilibrium" system.

TI Divergent effect of silicon on greenhouse gas production from reduced
   and oxidized peat organic matter
SO GEODERMA
LA English
DT Article
DE Silica; Organic matter; Redox conditions; Peat decomposition; Phosphorus
   mobilization; Incubation experiments
AB Peatlands store about 30% of the global soil carbon (C) stock. The decomposition of peat C in these systems depends on environmental parameters - such as water table levels and corresponding availability of electron acceptors for microbial respiration. Due to the latter, potential peat decomposition depends also on whether the material is initially oxidized or reduced prior to decomposition experiments.
   Recent studies revealed the importance of silicon (Si) for peat decomposition. High amounts of biogenic Si were found in peatlands, in particular in minerotrophic fens, and the importance of Si for graminoids and decomposability of respective litter has been widely discussed. Furthermore, the availability of Si was reported to influence the binding of phosphorus (P) to iron (Fe) and thereby the conditions under which decomposition proceeds. Yet the influence of Si on greenhouse gas production in peat under different initial redox conditions is largely unknown. Therefore, we intended to test the effect of Si on greenhouse gas production under different initial electron acceptor availabilities for microbial respiration, such as the availability of ferric Fe.
   We conducted two incubation experiments with initially oxidized and reduced peat organic matter (OM). We hypothesized that Si can mobilize P from Fe minerals, which increases microbial activity, and leads to higher production rates of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Using the two different materials, we studied how initial redox conditions would modify effects of Si. As the predominant form of Fe as either ferric Fe-(oxy)hydroxides or as ferrous Fe minerals (sulfides, carbonates) is important for interaction with Si, we further hypothesized that Si effects should be stronger in initially oxidized peat in presence of ferric Fe, compared to initially reduced peat with ferrous Fe only.
   For incubation experiments using formerly oxidized material the Si addition increased P concentrations in the pore water, and more CO2 was produced. The onset of methanogenesis was much stronger with than without addition of Si, indicating a more rapid depletion of electron acceptors by faster rates of respiration. We explain this by more P being available stimulating microbial activity, and also by a direct effect of Si on microbial activity and methanogenesis. The incubation of formerly reduced OM did not show any effects of Si on respiration processes, presumably due to the absence of ferric Fe phases.
   In conclusion, there was a clear difference in the effect of Si addition on decomposition of formerly oxidized compared to long term reduced OM, with only oxidized peat OM or peat with ferric Fe phases present showing clear Si effects. Consequently, redox conditions and availability of ferric Fe are a main control for Si effects on OM decomposition and nutrient availability. Little effects of Si can be expected under permanently reducing conditions and in absence of ferric Fe phases.

AB Alnus japonica in Kiritapp Mire, eastern Hokkaido, northern Japan was studied to determine the effects of temperature, precipitation, and sunshine upon radial growth. Alnus japonica grows in wetlands, and the distribution in Kiritapp Mire is at the latitudinal limit of the species. Wood samples (n = 101) were collected from a well-developed A. japonica wetland forest, and standardized tree-ring-width indices were developed using a third-order polynomial equation and high-frequency-pass filter. A significant positive correlation was found between tree-ring-width indices and corresponding annual mean temperatures and between both mean temperature and cumulative sunshine period during the growing season (June-October). Precipitation during the period of generally lowest redox potential (September) showed a significant positive correlation with tree growth. June sunshine of the ring-formation year and August sunshine during the previous growth year also showed significant positive correlations.

AB Three years (2009-2011) of near-continuous methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured with the eddy covariance (EC) technique at a temperate peatland located within the Marcell Experimental Forest, in northern Minnesota, USA. The peatland was a net source of CH4 and a net sink of CO2 in each year with annual carbon budgets of -26.8 (+/- 18.7), -15.5 (+/- 14.8), and -14.6 (+/- 21.5) g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2009-2011, respectively. Differences in the seasonal hydrometeorological conditions among the three study years were most pronounced during 2011, which was considerably warmer (+1.3 degrees C) and wetter (+40 mm) than the 30 year average. The annual CH4 budget was +11.8 (+/- 3.1), +12.2 (+/- 3.0), and +24.9 (+/- 5.6) g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the respective years and accounted for 23%-39% of the annual carbon budget. The larger CH4 emission in 2011 is attributed to significant warming of the peat column coupled with a high water table position throughout the entire growing season. Historical (1991-2011) CH4 emissions were estimated based on long-term hydrometeorological records and functional relationships derived from our 3 year field study. The predicted historical annual CH4 budget ranged from +7.8 to +15.2 (+/- 2.7) g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1). Recent (2007-2011) increases in temperature, precipitation, and rising water table at this site suggest that CH4 emissions have been increasing, but were generally greater from 1991 to 1999 when average soil temperature and precipitation were higher than in recent years. The global warming potential (considering CO2 and CH4) for this peatland was calculated based on a 100 year time horizon. In all three study years, the peatland had a net positive radiative forcing on climate and was greatest (+187 g C m(-2)) in 2011. The interannual variability in CH4 exchange at this site suggests high sensitivity to variations in hydrometeorological conditions. Citation: Olson, D. M., T. J. Griffis, A. Noormets, R. Kolka and J.

AB Ecosystems exchange climate-relevant trace gases with the atmosphere, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are a small but highly reactive part of the carbon cycle. VOCs have important ecological functions and implications for atmospheric chemistry and climate. We measured the ecosystem-level surface-atmosphere VOC fluxes using the eddy covariance technique at a shallow subarctic lake and an adjacent graminoid-dominated fen in northern Sweden during two contrasting periods: the peak growing season (mid-July) and the senescent period post-growing season (September-October).
   In July, the fen was a net source of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, dimethyl sulfide, isoprene, and monoterpenes. All of these VOCs showed a did cycle of emission with maxima around noon and isoprene dominated the fluxes (93 +/- 22 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), mean +/- SE). Isoprene emission was strongly stimulated by temperature and presented a steeper response to temperature (Q(10) = 14.5) than that typically assumed in biogenic emission models, supporting the high temperature sensitivity of arctic vegetation. In September, net emissions of methanol and isoprene were drastically reduced, while acetaldehyde and acetone were deposited to the fen, with rates of up to -6.7 +/- 2.8 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) for acetaldehyde.
   Remarkably, the lake was a sink for acetaldehyde and acetone during both periods, with average fluxes up to -19 +/- 1.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetone in July and up to -8.5 +/- 2.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) of acetaldehyde in September. The deposition of both carbonyl compounds correlated with their atmospheric mixing ratios, with deposition velocities of -0.23 +/- 0.01 and -0.68 +/- 0.03 cm s(-1) for acetone and acetaldehyde, respectively.
   Even though these VOC fluxes represented less than 0.5 % and less than 5 % of the CO2 and CH4 net carbon ecosystem exchange, respectively, VOCs alter the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Thus, understanding the response of their emissions to climate change is important for accurate prediction of the future climatic conditions in this rapidly warming area of the planet.

   TERRAIN UNITS; EVAPORATION; IMPACTS; VARIABILITY; ADVECTION; CANADA
AB A model to calculate the water balance of a hummocky sedge fen in the northern Hudson Bay Lowland is presented. The model develops the potential latent heat flux (evaporation) as a function of net radiation and atmospheric temperature. It is about equally sensitive to a 2% change in net radiation and a 1 degrees C change in temperature. The modelled potential evaporation agrees well with the Priestley-Taylor formulation of evaporation under conditions of a non-limiting water supply. The actual evaporative heat flux is modelled by expressing actual/potential evaporation as a function of potential accumulated water deficit. Model evaporation agrees well with energy balance calculations using 7 years of measured data including wet and dry extremes. Water deficit is defined as the depth of water below reservoir capacity. Modelled water table changes concur with measurements taken over a 4 year period. When net radiation, temperature and precipitation measurements are available the water balance can be projected to longer time periods. Over a 30 year interval (1965-1994) the water balance of the sedge fen showed the following. During the growing season, there was an increase in precipitation, no change in temperature and a decrease in net radiation, evapotranspiration and water deficit. There was also a decrease in winter snow depths. The fen was brought back to reservoir capacity during final snowmelt every year but one. Summer rainfall was the most important single factor affecting the water balance and the ratio actual/potential evaporation emerged as a linear function of rainfall amount. A 2 x CO2 climate warming scenario with an annual temperature increase of 4 degrees C and no precipitation change indicates lesser snow amounts and a shorter snow cover period. A greater summer water deficit, triggered mainly by greater evaporation during the month of May, is partially alleviated by lesser evaporation magnitudes in July. The greater water deficit would be counterbalanced by a 23% increase in summer rainfall. On average, the fen's water reservoir would still be recharged after winter snowmelt but the ground would remain at reservoir capacity for a shorter time. The warming scenario with a 10% decline in summer rainfall would create a large increase in the longevity and severity of the water deficit and this would be particularly evident during drier years. The carbon budget and peat accumulation and breakdown rates are strongly affected by changes in the water balance. Some evidence implies that greater water deficits lead to an increase in net carbon emissions. This implies that the sedge peatland could lose biomass under such conditions. An example is given where increased water deficit results in large decreases in local wetland streamflow.

AB 1. Cut-away peatlands devoid of vegetation form a persistent source of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. The restoration of the C sink function in such areas can be facilitated by raising the water table. Planting vascular plants and Sphagnum may hasten the restoration process further. However, little is known about the effects of different species on the restoration process.
   2. We studied carbon dioxide (CO(2)) exchange in stands of different plants in a restored cut-away site over two growing seasons to quantify their ability to form a C sink. We sampled five different types of stand: monocultures of Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex rostrata (pure plots), mixtures of Eriophorum or Carex and Sphagnum mosses (mixed plots) and control plots without vegetation. We applied the closed chamber technique to gather CO(2) exchange data for modelling of gross photosynthesis (P(G)) and ecosystem respiration (R(E)). Finally, we used the models to reconstruct the seasonal net CO(2) exchange of the stands formed by different plants.
   3. While the control plots without vegetation were sources of 20-71 g CO(2)-C m(-2), all the vegetated plots acted as C sinks during both growing seasons. The monostands of E. vaginatum and C. rostrata created sinks of 23-114 g CO(2)-C m(-2), while the mixtures of sedge and Sphagnum mosses resulted in larger sinks of 75-186 g CO(2)-C m(-2). The larger sinks of the mixed patches were due to the lower respiration/photosynthesis ratio.
   4. To eliminate the effect of differences in water table and the abundance of sedges between the patches, we reconstructed the CO(2) exchange for constant water table and vascular leaf area for all plots. The simulation further supported our result: the mixtures of sedge and Sphagnum mosses were clearly more efficient in sequestering CO(2) than pure sedge stands.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The increased functional diversity in a cut-away peatland site resulted in higher net ecosystem exchange. When restoring cut-away peatlands, reintroduction of Sphagna is recommended after the colonization of vascular plants to hasten the formation of a sink for C.

AB The effects of wood ash fertilisation on tree nutrition and growth on forested peatlands has been studied using loose ash, but in practice, ash fertilisation is done almost exclusively with granulated ash. In this study, the effects of granulated ash and loose ash (both 5 Mg ha(-1)) on the growth and nutrition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands were compared between a nitrogen-poor and a nitrogen-rich site over 15 years. On the nitrogen-rich site, wood ash application was also compared with commercial PK fertilisation. On the nitrogen-rich site, mean stand volume growth increase over unfertilised control treatment during the 15 year study period using granulated ash and commercial PK fertiliser was of the same magnitude (on average, 2.2-2.3 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)). However, when loose ash was used growth increase over control was higher (3.7 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)). On the nitrogenpoor site, the mean growth increase gained by loose or granulated ash (1.4-1.5 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)) over the unfertilised control treatment was not significant. Fertilisation with loose ash or PK increased foliar P, K and B concentrations already in the first or second growing season, following fertilisation on both sites. Granulated ash increased foliar P concentrations on the nitrogen-rich site less than loose ash. After an initial increase, foliar P, K and B concentrations decreased at the end of study period. On the nitrogen-poor site. foliar P concentrations were below the deficiency limit by the end of the study period.

AB The linear increment of Sphagnum fuscum and S. magellanicum in ombrotrophic mires of Western Siberia has been measured during two years over a transect about 2500 km long extending from forest-steppe to forest-tundra. Along the latitudinal gradient, the increment of both species has proved to be correlated with annual average air temperature and, in S. magellanicum, also with annual precipitation. The determinants of their growth differ between the southern, central, and northern parts of the study region. At the regional level, the annual and summer precipitation plays a more important role than the average air temperature. The increment of S. fuscum in the southern part is positively correlated with the amount of precipitation and negatively correlated with summer temperature, whereas the situation in the central part is inverse. In S. magellanicum, the linear increment is directly dependent on the annual average temperature and annual and summer precipitation in the south and on the annual and summer precipitation in the north of Western Siberia. The dynamics of linear growth of both species in bog pine forests during the growing season are similar: its rate is the highest in June, when the linear increment of S. fuscum and S. magellanicum amounts to 60 and 85% of the annual total, respectively.

AB Litter decomposition is an important source of dissolved organic matter (DOC). In peatlands with hardly degradable soil DOC, the input of DOC from vascular plant litter can represent an important source of nutrients and decomposable substrates for soil microorganisms. We established a laboratory incubation with the litters of three peatland plant dominants (Sphagnum fallax, Vaccinium myrtillus and Eriophorum vaginatum) for 200 days, aiming to study DOC production and its quality. The quality of the DOC leached from the litters was characterized by a distribution of C, N and P among molecular weight (MW) fractions (< 1, 1-10, 10-100 and > 100 kDa), their aromaticity, composition of low molecular weight compounds (organic acids, sugars and amino acids) and DOC biodegradability.
   The leaves of vascular plants decomposed the fastest, releasing larger amounts of nutrients and easily degradable organic acids, sugars and amino acids to the leachate, when compared to their roots and Sphagnum. DOC distribution to the MW fractions did not differ among the litters. Neither the DOC distribution to the respective fractions nor leachate C/N/P stoichiometry were factors driving DOC biodegradability. Total dissolved P distribution to the MW fractions significantly differed among the litters, with Sphagnum being very specific: P was initially associated only with high molecular weight DOC, while later it was redistributed to the lower MW fractions and complexed with Al and Fe. The complexation may retard soluble reactive P leaching especially from Sphagnum litter. DOC biodegradability was higher for the vascular plant leaf litter than for the Sphagnum litter in the early stages of decomposition (20 days) but later decreased and became more uniform for all litters. These temporal differences (by decomposition stage) were more pronounced than those caused by litter origin. Our results indicate that mainly leaf litter of vascular plants can release significant amounts of DOC during the early stage of decomposition. This DOC is more aromatic with higher biodegradability and more nutrients (especially P) as compared to Sphagnum and can thus temporarily stimulate microbial activity in habitats dominated by the vascular plants.

AB Here we present multiproxy inorganic geochemical records froma peat core (ZK5) from the Dajiuhu Basin in central China to investigate peatland deposition processes and atmospheric metal pollution and to explore their relationships with East Asian monsoon change and human activities in the Middle Yangtze Valley since 20,000 cal yr BP. The peat physicochemical data including total organic carbon (TOC), trace elements, and grain-size show that the site has changed from a lake during the cold-wet Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 20,000-18,000 cal yr BP), to a marshy wetland during the mild last deglaciation (18,000-11,500 cal yr BP) and a peatland during the mostly warm and dry Holocene (11,500 cal yr BP-present). This general sequence corresponds with changes in East Asian monsoon indicated by stalagmites delta O-18 records and boreal summer insolation. Marked decreases in trace element concentrations correspond to two periods of peatland expansion during the abrupt hydroclimatic transitions from the LGM to the last deglaciation and from the last deglaciation to the early Holocene. Warm-dry mid-Holocene might induce high organic matter decomposition in peat sediments. Increasing natural element concentrations since the late Holocene are correlated with the weakening of the summer monsoon and elevated atmospheric dust deposition. Increasing Cu and Pb concentrations in peat record indicate large-scale Cu smelting during the Bronze Age and excessive coal burning during the 10th century or so. The anthropogenic heavy metals were transported by prevailing East Asian summer monsoon and deposited in the Dajiuhu Basin during periods of heightened human activities. Our compilation of heavy metals records across China confirmed the noticeable impacts of the historical human activity on deposition environments during the late Holocene. consequently, trace elements from the Dajiuhu Basin are reliable proxies for capturing monsoon climate-induced peatland deposition response and present important evidence for a historical atmospheric heavy metal pollution in the Middle Yangtze Valley. Our results offer useful references for peatland evolution and protection under the background of global change. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is growing recognition that changes in vegetation composition can strongly influence peatland carbon cycling, with potential feedbacks to future climate. Nevertheless, despite accelerated climate and vegetation change in this ecosystem, the growth responses of peatland plant species to combined warming and vegetation change are unknown. Here, we used a field warming and vegetation removal experiment to test the hypothesis that dominant species from the three plant functional types present (dwarf-shrubs: Calluna vulgaris; graminoids: Eriophorum vaginatum; bryophytes: Sphagnum capillifolium) contrast in their growth responses to warming and the presence or absence of other plant functional types. Warming was accomplished using open top chambers, which raised air temperature by approximately 0.35 degrees C, and we measured air and soil microclimate as potential mechanisms through which both experimental factors could influence growth. We found that only Calluna growth increased with experimental warming (by 20 %), whereas the presence of dwarf-shrubs and bryophytes increased growth of Sphagnum (46 %) and Eriophorum (20 %), respectively. Sphagnum growth was also negatively related to soil temperature, which was lower when dwarf-shrubs were present. Dwarf-shrubs may therefore promote Sphagnum growth by cooling the peat surface. Conversely, the effect of bryophyte presence on Eriophorum growth was not related to any change in microclimate, suggesting other factors play a role. In conclusion, our findings reveal contrasting abiotic and biotic controls over dominant peatland plant growth, suggesting that community composition and carbon cycling could be modified by simultaneous climate and vegetation change.

AB Phytometers are indicator transplants that provide information on site conditions based on plant survival, growth and reproduction. Since this is a relatively new approach, standards for its implementation remain to be defined, for example, during peatland restoration. Peatland restoration frequently aims at recovering characteristic communities, and a key attribute of successfully restored ecosystems is their capacity to sustain viable populations of target species. When not actively introduced, these species are expected to establish on their own after improving site conditions, for example by rewetting. Assessments to determine whether this goal is met require the long-term monitoring of species' presence, whereas the underlying causes of these observations, i.e. site or dispersal limitation, often remain unknown. Using phytometers within ecological restoration helps addressing this question. The goal of this study is to compare the responses of several species and traits to environmental conditions in restored peatlands. Three target species (Drosera rotundifolia, Eriophorum vaginatum, Vaccinium oxycoccos) were planted in restored montane peatlands in central Germany, while in a greenhouse experiment, the same species were grown on peat from the field sites and exposed to two water levels. Several plant traits were measured and compared with variation in light, water and soil conditions. The response to habitat conditions was species-specific, indicating that the use of different phytometers increases the reliability of monitoring. Survival and growth traits were suitable to assess a wide range of abiotic conditions, while differences in reproductive output were more time-consuming to measure. Survival provided the most conclusive results for species sensitive to stressful habitat conditions. Biomass and other size metrics of the phytometers, as well as growth and reproductive traits were partly redundant. Thus, we suggest recording survival and biomass and use non-destructive growth measurements for repeated assessments, while the choice of the most suitable size trait should depend on the growth form. Our study stresses the potential of phytometers for monitoring the restoration outcome, while highlighting the importance of species and trait selection.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the Cu(II) complexing capacity and stability constants of Cu(II) complexes of humic acids isolated from two well-characterized raised bog peat profiles in respect to the basic properties and humification characteristics of the studied peats and their humic acids. Found complex stability constants (logK=4.06-5.73) significantly change within the studied bog profiles and are well correlated with the age and decomposition degree of the peat layer from which the humic acids have been isolated. None of the basic characteristics of humic acids (such as concentration of carboxylic groups and total acidity, hydrophobicity, and others) alone can fully explain the complex-forming capacity of humic acids thus indicating complexity of the metal - natural organic matter interaction. Among factors that influence this complex forming process, molecular mass and ability to form micellar structures (supramolecules) of humic substances are of key importance.

AB The importance of soil storage in global carbon cycling is well recognised and factors leading to increased losses from this pool may act as a positive feedback mechanism in global warming. Upland peat soils are usually assumed to serve as carbon sinks, there is however increasing evidence of carbon loss from upland peat soils, and DOC concentrations in UK rivers have increased markedly over the past three decades. A number of drivers for increasing DOC release from peat soils have been proposed although many of these would not explain fine-scale variations in DOC release observed in many catchments.
   We examined the effect of land use and management on DOC production in upland peat catchments at two spatial scales within the UK. DOC concentration was measured in streams draining 50 small-scale catchments (< 3 km(2)) in three discrete regions of the south Pennines and one area in the North Yorkshire Moors. Annual mean DOC concentration was also derived from water colour data recorded at water treatment works for seven larger scale catchments (1.5-20 km(2)) in the south Pennines. Soil type and land use/management in all catchments were characterised from NSRI digital soil data and ortho-corrected colour aerial imagery.
   Of the factors assessed, representing all combinations of soil type and land use together with catchment slope and area, the proportion of exposed peat surface resulting from new heather burning was consistently identified as the most significant predictor of variation in DOC concentration. This relationship held across all blanket peat catchments and scales.
   We propose that management activities are driving changes in edaphic conditions in upland peat to those more favourable for aerobic microbial activity and thus enhance peat decomposition leading to increased losses of carbon from these environments. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), a major greenhouse gas and ozone depleter, is emitted from drained organic soils typically developed in floodplains. We investigated the effect of the water table depth and soil oxygen (O-2) content on N2O fluxes and their nitrogen isotope composition in a drained floodplain fen in Estonia. Measurements were done at natural water table depth, and we created a temporary anoxic environment by experimental flooding. From the suboxic peat (0.5-6 mg O-2/L) N2O emissions peaked at 6 mg O-2/L and afterwards decreased with decreasing O-2. From the anoxic and oxic peat (0 and >6 mg O-2/L, respectively) N2O emissions were low. Under anoxic conditions the delta N-15/delta N-14 ratio of the top 10 cm peat layer was low, gradually decreasing to 30 cm. In the suboxic peat, delta N-15/delta N-14 ratios increased with depth. In samples of peat fluctuating between suboxic and anoxic, the elevated N-15/N-14 ratios (delta N-15 = 7-9 parts per thousand. ambient N-2) indicated intensive microbial processing of nitrogen. Low values of site preference (SP; difference between the central and peripheral N-15 atoms) and delta O-18-N2O in the captured gas samples indicate nitrifier denitrification in the floodplain fen.

AB Stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating and analyses of pollen, plant macrofossils and testate amoebae were used to reconstruct the development and ecology of a small raised bog in a karst-dominated landscape in the Swiss Jura Mountains. Special focus was on past vegetation and on the history of Pinus rotundata in relation to anthropogenic and climatic influences. Testate amoebae were used to reconstruct past local soil pH and water-table depth. The inferred development of the Praz-Rodet bog typifies a classic hydroseral terrestrialization of a small basin. Two features are specific for this site. First, the bog was much wetter than today for a long period; according to our hypothesis, this only changed as a consequence of human activities. Second, two hiatuses are present at the coring location (Younger Dryas-early Preboreal, and 4700-2800 cal. yr BP), the former probably caused by low lake productivity due to cold temperatures and the latter by the erosional activity of the adjacent small river. The date of 2800 cal. yr BP for renewed peat accumulation may be related to climatic change (Subboreal-Subatlantic transition). Pollen indicators failed to show one hiatus: an apparently complete pollen sequence is therefore no guarantee of an uninterrupted sediment accumulation. Evidence of early minor human impact on the vegetation in the Joux Valley dates back to c. 6850 calendar years, congruous with the early Neolithic in the Jura Mountains. The history of Pious rotundata appears to be more complex than previously believed. Human activity is clearly responsible for the present abundance of this species, but the tree was naturally present on the bog long before the first evidence of important human disturbance of the site (1500 cal. yr BP). It is suggested that, in karst-dominated landscapes, dense forests growing on mineral soils around raised bogs may significantly reduce summer evapotranspiration by acting as windbreaks. Forest clearance results in increased evapotranspiration, causing a lowering of the water table on the bog and a modification of the vegetation cover. This hypothesis has implications for the management of similar small raised bogs in karst-dominated landscape.

AB The restoration of drained peatlands to re-establish biodiverse peat-forming plant communities and typical habitats is a long-term process. To document this process, monitoring concepts must be found that are as operational, cost-effective and non-invasive as possible for the new sensitive ecosystems. The monitoring of the developing plant communities using multisensory Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data has great potential. We investigated two fen sites in north-eastern Germany that were rewetted in the late 1990s. The areas were flown with a Fixed-Wing UAV and three sensors (RGB, multispectral, thermal). A multisensor dataset consisting of the sensor data, plant height and five spectral indices was classified with a random forest algorithm. The classification accuracies were 87.1 and 89.0% for 10 and 11 classes for the respective sites. Furthermore, the band importance was analyzed using the Gini index. Plant height in combination with the multispectral information were the most important variables. This study underlines the suitability of UAVs for monitoring spectrally similar vegetation because of their capability to generate 3D surface models using structure-from-motion methods and to carry different sensor systems. In addition, they can be used on a regional scale and mostly independent of cloud cover. Secondary results of the study are that the band importance can be determined by Random Forest algorithms even with few trees (e.g. 10 trees), because the order remains very stable independently of the number of trees.

AB Regional variation in size and shape of Sphagnum hummocks of eight lowland mires throughout Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, was examined in relation to climatic factors. The size and shape of hummocks significantly differed among the regions: low and flat hummocks occurred in the northern region and next to the Sea of Japan; moderately raised and conical hummocks occurred in the western part of the Pacific coast; and extremely raised and cylindrical hummocks occurred in the eastern region. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the mean and maximum heights and height/basal area of hummocks were negatively correlated with evapotranspiration rate (E-0) in summer, duration of sunshine, and air temperature. Of these, evapotranspiration rate in summer positively correlated with radiation and thermal factors. Mean height of hummocks within a mire was increased with precipitation during the growing season. Because the regional difference of the hummock form was not related to the difference in nutrient conditions, the effects of evapotranspiration and precipitation prevailed over edaphic conditions. Higher E-0 in summer was considered to cause water stress for hummock species in the northern region and next to the Sea of Japan, whereas heavy rainfall relieved it in the western region of the Pacific coast. Consequently, lower and flat hummocks were a result of the higher E-0 in summer, moderately raised and conical hummocks of the medium E-0 and high precipitation, and extremely raised and cylindrical hummocks of a lower E-0 due to prolonged foggy days.

AB Multiple and rapid environmental changes in the Arctic have major consequences for the entire ecosystem. Soil water chemistry is one component with important implications for understanding climate feedbacks, plant growth, microbial turnover and net greenhouse gas emissions. Here we assess the contrasting growing season soil water chemistry in a Low arctic Greenlandic mesic tundra heath and a fen, which have been subjected to factorial treatments of summer warming using open top chambers (OTCs), snow addition using snow fences, which increase soil temperature in late winter, and shrub removal mimicking herbivory attack. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and plant nutrients, including NO3-, NH4+, PO42+ and total dissolved N were measured during multiple growing seasons (2013-2016) to quantify the treatment effects on nutrient availability in two dominating, but contrasting, vegetation types.
   Ambient nutrient concentrations in the mesic tundra heath decreased throughout the growing season and increased during senescence, while concentrations were highest during peak growing season in the fen. The content of NH4+ and DOC were highest in the fen, whereas NO3- was highest in the mesic tundra heath. The fen had no seasonal pattern.
   Summer warming in the mesic tundra heath did not change the availability of nutrients, but in combination with shrub removal, both NO3- and DOC concentrations increased, likely due to reduced plant uptake. Shrub removal alone increased NO3- in one growing season, and, combined with snow addition, increased DOC. Significant effects of shrub removal were mostly found in 2016. Snow addition combined with summer warming increased DOC and total N concentrations and highlights the potential loss of dissolved C from the ecosystem.
   In the fen, shrub removal alone and combined with summer warming decreased DOC. Snow addition alone and in combination with summer warming similarly decreased DOC.
   In the mesic tundra heath, shrub removal caused higher soil water contents in all years. In the dry and warm 2016, it meant <10% soil water content in controls and 15-20% in shrub removal plots during the peak growing season, which may have relieved soil moisture limitation on mineralization rates in the latter.
   We conclude that soil water chemistry is vegetation-specific, and that treatment effects are surprisingly limited when comparing multiple years with contrasting precipitation patterns. Herbivory may have larger impact in very dry, warm summers and, together with extreme weather events, exert similar or larger effects than four years of temperature manipulations. The effects of summer warming or increased winter snow depend on ecosystem type and moisture status of the soil. The combination of multi-year and multi-site studies therefore seem important for understanding future biogeochemical dynamics in Arctic landscapes.

AB Permafrost peatlands are important pools of soil carbon. Soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization and its temperature sensitivity in permafrost peatlands are crucial for predictions of soil carbon-climate feedback. However, little is known about the changes in SOC mineralization and its mechanism in response to environmental change in the permafrost peatlands of Northeastern China. We collected seven permafrost peatland soils from Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains in Northeastern China to investigate how the responses of microbes and labile substrates control the mineralization of SOC in the laboratory incubation study. The results show that temperature and sampling sites affected the mineralization of SOC. Elevated temperatures significantly increased the rate of carbon mineralization across the peatland soils. The mean sensitivity of SOC mineralization to temperature (Q(10) value) was 2.96. The increase in substrate availability and microbial abundance in parallel with the increase in temperature is responsible for the high rates of decomposition of the organic carbon pools. We found that the mineralization of soil carbon positively correlated with the concentrations of soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+-N, NO3--N, as well as the abundances of bacteria, fungi, methanotrophs and nirK denitrifiers. Moreover, the content of DOC positively correlated with the abundances of soil bacteria, methanotrophs and nirK denitrifiers, indicating that the influences of soil microbial abundances on carbon mineralization were strongly mediated by the availability of carbon substrates. Our findings provide novel insights into the effects of increasing temperatures on the relationship between microbial communities and labile substrates and their roles in carbon decomposition in permafrost peatlands.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY

DT Article
ID DEPOSITS; COAL
AB During the Miocene a number of fault bounded basins developed in Central Anatolia, Turkey. One such basin at Cayirhan, near Beypazari, contains thick, laterally extensive lignite seams. This basin was filled initially with coarse elastic material. Upward fining of the clastics during basin fill, with an increase in the amount of clay and carbon content led to the development of relatively shallow limnic basins in which extensive peat deposits accumulated in low-lying mires. These lignites are characterized by their high sulphur and ash contents (up to 8.2% S and 68.3% ash on an air-dried basis). Studies of the sulphur and ash contents reveal three types of distribution; namely, vertical variation within individual seams, variation between the seams and lateral variation across the basin. In the case of the sulphur content, vertical variation within and between the seams is related to variations in the amount and source of the sulphate in the mire water, and the lateral variation is probably related to structural/topographic control of the mire at the time of formation. Variation in the ash content within the seams is probably the result of depositional processes at the time of mire development. Variation between seams is recognized due to the presence of ubiquitous zeolites in the mineral matter; namely heulandite in the first seam and analcime in the second seam. This is probably the result of variations in the chemistry of the original volcanoclastic or clastic material associated with the lignite or of variations in the chemistry of the circulating fluid. There is a broad east-west lateral variation across the basin in the ash content of the seams, probably resulting from variations in the amount and rate of elastic or volcanoclastic influx into the mire at the time of formation, related to structural/topographic controls.

AB Remote sensing is increasingly widely used in nature conservation management. The research focuses on developing an optimal set of airborne raster data for the identification of the invasive alien species Spiraea tomentosa L. The plant species selected for the purposes of this study poses a serious threat to peat bog plant communities, moist coniferous forests, and meadows in Central Europe. The impact of the data acquisition time on the accuracy of classification and the percentage cover limit required for correct identification of a target species using the developed method were also investigated. The study area is located in the Lower Silesian forests in Poland and is protected as a Natura 2000 site. Airborne hyperspectral and laser scanning data were simultaneously acquired two times in the growing season (August and September 2016) parallel to on-ground reference data collection. The 1 m resolution HySpex images with spectral range of 0.4-2.5 mu m were corrected atmospherically, radiometrically and geometrically. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data acquired at 7 points/m(2) were used to generate several products, e.g. Canopy Height Model (CHM), rasters representing morphometric features of the area (Multiresolution Index of the Ridge Top Flatness or Valley Bottom Flatness-MRRTF, MRVBF), wetness relations (Topographic Wetness Index-TWI) and the availability of light (Total Insolation-TI), intensity of laser pulse reflection and geometric relations of vegetation points (i.a. Vegetation Cover, Vegetation Mean Intensity). The Random Forest (RF) classification and different raster datasets were used to identify the target species. As a result, the highest accuracy was obtained for the scenario based on HySpex images acquired in September. The accuracy (f1 score) for the target species achieved 83%. The developed method for the identification of Spiraea tomentosa has a great potential for application and can be used for monitoring peat bogs threatened by invasion of alien plants.

AB Analyses of pollen, tephra, mineral input and degree of peat humification from three neighbouring raised peat profiles at Corlea, central Ireland, covering the period of the deposition of a tephra layer dated to just before 2290 cal, BC, and thought to represent Hekla-4 (2310 +/- 20 BC), are used to show the problems of relying on data from a single profile when invoking relationships between volcanic activity, climate and ecosystem response. While there appears to be a strong correlation between tephra deposition and flooding of the bog surface in one profile, with a short-lived increase in the rate of peat accumulation, comparison with the other two records suggests that pear had already begun a trend to a less humified condition before tephra deposition, and that evidence of local bog surface flooding was neither consistent nor synchronous.

AB Based on studying the diatom flora by use of the radiocarbon dating methods, tephrostratigraph and other available biostratigraphic data, we reconstructed the settings of development of peat deposits in Tanfiliev and Polonskii Islands (Lesser Kuril Ridge) for the end of the Late Pleistocene. Holocene according to climatic changes, tsunami events and the influence of volcanic ash falls. It is found that the main factor determining the time history of peat bogs is represented by hydroclimatic changes during the Holocene. We identified several (quite well comparable for the two islands) waterlogging and drying stages of peat deposits, and determined the peat accumulation rates for different periods in the Holocene. In the Mid-Holocene (7240-3660 years ago), the formation of peat deposits was proceeding in conditions of insignificant waterlogging, and the peat accumulation rate was decreasing substantially. An increase in waterlogging started about 3660 years ago. Waterlogging of the peat deposits increased considerably after the fall of volcanic Ta-c and Ma-b ashes. The dry conditions, caused by short-lasting cooling periods, existed about 12, 7 and 1.5 ka. During the final stage of the Late Holocene, peat deposits were developing in water-deficient, strongly acidic conditions. They exhibited the presence of marine kinds of diatoms. In the Early Holocene, diatoms were supplied to the peat bogs as a result of the scour of marine Pleistocene deposits which existed within a land bridge. In the Mid-and Late Holocene, the presence of marine diatoms in peat deposits is associated with tsunami events.

AB Peatlands store vast amounts of carbon (C) within the global terrestrial biosphere. Drainage and cultivation of peat soils lead to rapid soil degradation and C losses, and this may worsen under warming as the soils are no longer protected by anaerobic conditions. To predict the rates of soil C loss and design effective mitigation strategies, it is important to understand what controls organic matter mineralization in these soils. Using the 0-10 cm soil depth of thick and thin (degraded) agricultural peat soils, we investigated the fate of low molecular weight organic substrates (LMWOS) and how the microbial biomass consuming these substrates responded to temperature. We incubated the soils under increasing temperatures (4, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C) for 72 h. Either C-14-labelled glucose or amino acids were added to the soils and their speed of breakdown, partitioning into anabolic/catabolic processes and microbial C use efficiency (CUE) were determined. The total (CO2)-C-14 loss from soil increased significantly with increasing temperature during 72-h incubation, regardless of peat layer thickness. Warming altered the dynamics of LMWOS mineralization by changing C allocation and the turnover rate of different microbial C pools. The half-life of LMWOS decreased more than 50% when temperature increased from 4 to 30 degrees C for both substrates. CUE was always higher for thin than thick peat soil and both declined by 0.002-0.005 degrees C-1 with increasing temperature. Thin peat decreased substrate C allocation into the fast cycling C pool compared to the thick peat, but had no overall effect on pool turnover rate. Our work suggests that climate warming will accelerate C mineralization and soil loss in drained peat soils, with larger effects expected in thick peat soil. This study provides an important initial step in characterizing the response of the microbial utilization of labile C to temperature change and soil degradation in cultivated peatlands.

AB Rainfall events have been reported of great influence on concentration and flux of aquatic organic carbon, but little is known in ditch water of peatlands. In this work we chose a ditch located in a peatland of Zoige Basin in northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and studied the response of organic carbon (in dissolved form (DOC) and in particulate form (POC)) to rainfall events with varying intensity. Organic carbon dynamics during four rainfall events were recorded in the growing season of 2016. During events, evident but different trends in both POC and DOC were observed. POC steeply increased through the rising limb of the hydrograph to maximum concentrations following the discharge peaks and followed by steep decrease, while dilution effect on DOC was observed. Different temporal patterns between POC and DOC indicated that they were transported through different flow paths. The dilution in DOC was attributed to rainwater mixing with overland flow induced by infiltration excess runoff, rainwater directly fell into the ditch and mixed with ditch water, and sampling uncertainties. Rainfall intensity had strong influence on organic carbon. The higher rainfall intensity, the higher fluctuation and higher maximum value as well as mean value of POC/DOC concentration. The investigation of the response of organic carbon to rainfall events and the mechanisms responsible is important for assessing impacts on peatland ecosystem processes.

   Metatranscriptomics; Vascular plants; Herbivory
AB Herbivory by barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) alters the vegetation cover and reduces ecosystem productivity in high-Arctic peatlands, limiting the carbon sink strength of these ecosystems. Here we investigate how herbivory-induced vegetation changes affect the activities of peat soil microbiota using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and targeted metabolomics in a comparison of fenced exclosures and nearby grazed sites. Our results show that a different vegetation with a high proportion of vascular plants developed due to reduced herbivory, resulting in a larger and more diverse input of polysaccharides to the soil at exclosed study sites. This coincided with higher sugar and amino acid concentrations in the soil at this site as well as the establishment of a more abundant and active microbiota, including saprotrophic fungi with broad substrate ranges, like Helotiales (Ascomycota) and Agaricales (Basidiomycota). A detailed description of fungal transcriptional profiles revealed higher gene expression for cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin and chitin degradation at herbivory-exclosed sites. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the number of genes and transcripts for predatory eukaryotes such as Entomobryomorpha (Arthropoda). We conclude that in the absence of herbivory, the development of a vascular vegetation alters the soil polysaccharide composition and supports larger and more active populations of fungi and predatory eukaryotes.

AB The peatlands of northern latitudes represent an enormous store of organic carbon. The decomposition of peat and the release of carbon dioxide is expected to increase with temperature as a result of climate change. CO2 emission and O-2 uptake were measured during laboratory incubations of homogenised peat samples from 15 sites in Scotland. These were made either at fixed temperatures or in experiments where the temperature was steadily raised and lowered in 2 degrees C steps, enabling Arrhenius plots to be made and the temperature response to be quantified as an activation energy or as a Q(10) The respiratory quotient varied with temperature and this led to higher Q(10) values for O-2 uptake than for CO2 emission. Feats varied widely in their response to temperature; Q(10) values were between 2.2 and 19 with a mean of 4.8. For most peats the response was approximately constant over the range of temperature tested but a third of the peats showed a marked deviation over the range 1-5 degrees C where Q(10) values increased considerably. Several published models describing the change in temperature response with temperature were applied to the data. A function in which the log of;the soil respiration rate is a quadratic in temperature gave the best coverall fit. Based on the observed laboratory Q(10) values, a rise in mean annual temperature of 5 degrees C could potentially increase CO2 emissions by a factor of 2- to 4-fold. For some peats at low temperatures (0-5 degrees C) small changes in temperature could have a much more marked effect. This may be significant for the peatlands in Scotland and similar latitudes where soil temperatures are commonly within this range and where predicted temperature increases over the next 50 years may bring about a significant increase in peat decomposition rates.

AB There is a strong correlation between iron oxide mineral and organic carbon (OC) concentrations. However, the role of iron oxide minerals in the preservation of OC in peatlands is poorly understood. In this study, we collected soil samples from 10 peatlands in central and west China to comprehensively investigate the concentration, characteristics, and spatial variability of iron oxide-bound OC (Fe-bound OC) concentrations and determine the impact of climatic factors and soil physicochemical properties on the correlation between OC and iron oxides. Our results showed that the concentration of Fe-bound OC ranged from 3.91 to 18.79 g kg(-1). On average, Febound OC accounted for 3.42 +/- 1.32% of soil OC. The molar ratio of OC: Fe ranged from 2.17 to 12.18, indicating that coprecipitation was the dominant mechanism affecting the binding of OC to reactive iron oxides in peatlands. delta C-13 isotope analyses revealed that Fe-bound OC was relatively enriched in C-13 in peatlands. Iron mineral sources, local vegetation, and the water table were responsible for differences in the concentration of Febound OC identified among the 10 sites. Correlation analysis results indicated that total organic carbon (TOC) was the main determinant factor for the concentration of Fe-bound OC (r = 0.549, p < 0.01), and the binding mechanism was jointly regulated by TOC and reactive Fe content. The proportion of Fe-bound OC to TOC (f(Fe-bound) (OC)) was positively correlated with the reactive Fe (r = 0.457, p < 0.05), indicating that the importance of binding with iron minerals in OC accumulation is regulated by the concentration of reactive Fe in peatlands. This study highlights the quantitative characteristics and spatial variability of Fe-bound OC in peatlands, providing important information for assessing and managing the carbon cycle in peatland ecosystems.

AB This study integrated metagenomic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic approaches to investigate microbial metabolic potential for organic matter decomposition and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) acquisition in soils of an ombrotrophic peatland in the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), Minnesota, USA. This analysis revealed vertical stratification in key enzymatic pathways and taxa containing these pathways. Metagenomic analyses revealed that genes encoding laccases and dioxygenases, involved in aromatic compound degradation, declined in relative abundance with depth, while the relative abundance of genes encoding metabolism of amino sugars and all four saccharide groups increased with depth in parallel with a 50% reduction in carbohydrate content. Most Cu-oxidases were closely related to genes from Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria, and type 4 laccase-like Cu-oxidase genes were >8 times more abundant than type 3 genes, suggesting an important and overlooked role for type 4 Cu-oxidase in phenolic compound degradation. Genes associated with sulfate reduction and methanogenesis were the most abundant anaerobic respiration genes in these systems, with low levels of detection observed for genes of denitrification and Fe(III) reduction. Fermentation genes increased in relative abundance with depth and were largely affiliated with Syntrophobacter. Methylocystaceae-like small-subunit (SSU) rRNA genes, pmoA, and mmoX genes were more abundant among methanotrophs. Genes encoding N-2 fixation, P uptake, and P regulons were significantly enriched in the surface peat and in comparison to other ecosystems, indicating N and P limitation. Persistence of inorganic orthophosphate throughout the peat profile in this P-limiting environment indicates that P may be bound to recalcitrant organic compounds, thus limiting P bioavailability in the subsurface. Comparative metagenomic analysis revealed a high metabolic potential for P transport and starvation, N-2 fixation, and oligosaccharide degradation at MEF relative to other wetland and soil environments, consistent with the nutrient-poor and carbohydrate-rich conditions found in this Sphagnum-dominated boreal peatland.

AB Feedbacks to global warming may cause terrestrial ecosystems to add to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, thus exacerbating climate change. The contribution that soil respiration makes to these terrestrial emissions, particularly from carbon-rich soils such as peatlands, is of significant importance and its response to changing climatic conditions is of considerable debate. We collected intact soil cores from an upland blanket bog situated within the northern Pennines, England, UK and investigated the individual and interactive effects of three primary controls on soil organic matter decomposition: (i) temperature (5, 10 and 15 degrees C); (ii) moisture (50 and 100% field capacity - FC); and (iii) substrate quality, using increasing depth from the surface (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) as an analogue for increased recalcitrance of soil organic material. Statistical analysis of the results showed that temperature, moisture and substrate quality all significantly affected rates of peat decomposition. Q(10) values indicated that the temperature sensitivity of older/more recalcitrant soil organic matter significantly increased (relative to more labile peat) under reduced soil moisture (50% FC) conditions, but not under 100% FC, suggesting that soil microorganisms decomposing the more recalcitrant soil material preferred more aerated conditions. Radiocarbon analyses revealed that soil decomposers were able to respire older, more recalcitrant soil organic matter and that the source of the material (deduced from the delta C-13 analyses) subject to decomposition, changed depending on depth in the peat profile.

AB This study focuses on discussing the relationship between the accumulation of peat and its compaction in the overbank zone of the Miocene river system. The examined 2nd Lusatian lignite seam is characteristically interbedded with sandy deposits and these are less compressible than peat. Therefore, in favourable conditions such as those found at Chlapowo Cliff (on the Baltic Sea coast in northern Poland), it is possible to identify the effects of an even or uneven lowering of the mire surface, resulting from diversified compaction of the underlying phytogenic beds. The research problem was applied to two examples located close to each other within the lignite seam. The first case shows the accumulation of fresh peat layers of almost equal thickness, while the second one presents a reduction in the thickness of fresh peat beds over the fossilised channel-fill sandy body. Only the latter example allows us to calculate the peat-to-lignite compaction ratio.
   The results of the compaction ratio obtained, Cr approximate to 7.37, mean that the youngest, fresh peat layers were compacted at least 7 times, transforming them into lignite beds. However, such a high compaction value, estimated for the top layers of the Miocene mire, cannot be directly taken into account when reconstructing the total thickness of the peat seam prior to covering it with mineral overburden. The published peat-to-lignite compaction ratios, determined using other research methods, for the 2nd Lusatian lignite seam or its stratigraphic equivalents range from 1.7 to 6.0 in most cases, with averages of 2.2 to 4.0. The differences between the data in the literature and the results given in this paper are due to the fact that the process of peat/lignite compaction is ongoing and cumulative.

AB Sedimentary facies types of the Pleistocene deposits of the Modern Pearl River Delta in Guangdong Province, China and Permian Member D deposits in Huainan coalfield in Anhui Province are exemplified by depositional facies of anastomosing fluvial systems. In both study areas, sand/sandstone and mud/mudstone-dominated facies types formed in diverging and converging, coeval fluvial channels laterally juxtaposed with floodplains containing ponds, lakes, and topogenous mires. The mires accumulated thin to thick peat/coal deposits that vary in vertical and lateral distribution between the two study areas. This difference is probably due to attendant sedimentary processes that affected the floodplain environments. The ancestral floodplains of the Modern Pearl River Delta were reworked by combined fluvial and tidal and estuarine processes. In contrast, the floodplains of the Permian Member D were mainly influenced by freshwater fluvial processes. In addition, the thick, laterally extensive coal zones of the Permian Member D may have formed in topogenous mires that developed on abandoned courses of anastomosing Fluvial systems. This is typified by Seam 13-1, which is a blanket-like body that thickens to as much as 8 m but also splits into thinner beds. This seam overlies deposits of diverging and converging, coeval fluvial channels of the Sandstone D-3 and associated overbank-floodplain deposits. The limited areal extent of lenticular Pleistocene peat deposits of the Modern Pearl River Delta is due to their primary accumulation in topogenous mires in the central floodplains that were restricted by contemporaneous anastomosing channels.

AB In the northwestern part of the San Juan basin, Colorado, thick high-volatile B bituminous coal deposits in the Upper Cretaceous Fruitland Formation are associated with nearshore marine sandstones of the Pictured Cliffs Sandstone. Detailed work along the outcrop and examination of drill cores, revealed two coal-bearing zones in the lower 60 m of the Fruitland Formation. Each zone is up to 13 m thick and consists of interbedded bright and dull coal (average ash values of 17 and 34% on a moisture-free basis, respectively), thin fine-grained clastic partings and abundant altered volcanic ash partings.
   Isopachs of the interval between the top of the Pictured Cliffs Sandstone and a marker bed (Huerfanito Bentonite Bed) in the underlying Lewis Shale show linear zones where the interval abruptly thickens. These zones, which trend northwest to southeast, represent areas where the shoreline paused during an overall migration to the northeast. Isopach maps of coal in the lower part of the Fruitland Formation and subsurface correlation of shoreface sandstones with coal zones show that the thickest accumulation of coal is 20-25 km landward of these coeval shorelines.
   The Fruitland coals may be compared to the high-ash peats of the Dismal Swamp in the southeastern U.S.A., which for-m in pocosin mires about 20 km inland from the Atlantic coast. Clastic deposition, resulting from coastal processes, precludes the formation of peat in low-lying mires adjacent to the shoreline. The high ash yield, numerous partings and the relationship with the coeval shoreline suggest that the coals in the lower part of the Fruitland Formation accumulated in mires that were transitional from low-lying to raised.

AB The concentrations of chloroplast pigments were determined in current-year tissues of Sphagnum capillifolium (Ehrh.) Hedw. harvested at the end of the growing season in a bog in the southern Alps of Italy. Concentrations of both chlorophylls were highest in the midsummer segment. Concentrations of carotenoids were fairly stable, except in the spring segment, whereas chlorophyll derivatives (pheophytin, pheophorbide, and chlorophyllide) accumulated in the top segment, corresponding to the autumnal capitulum. This indicates a rapid degradation of chlorophyll, probably caused by nightly chilling, at the end of the growing season.

AB Elevated nitrogen deposition and climate change alter the vegetation communities and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in peatlands. To address this issue we developed a new process-oriented biogeochemical model (PEATBOG) for analyzing coupled carbon and nitrogen dynamics in northern peatlands. The model consists of four submodels, which simulate: (1) daily water table depth and depth profiles of soil moisture, temperature and oxygen levels; (2) competition among three plants functional types (PFTs), production and litter production of plants; (3) decomposition of peat; and (4) production, consumption, diffusion and export of dissolved C and N species in soil water. The model is novel in the integration of the C and N cycles, the explicit spatial resolution belowground, the consistent conceptualization of movement of water and solutes, the incorporation of stoichiometric controls on elemental fluxes and a consistent conceptualization of C and N reactivity in vegetation and soil organic matter. The model was evaluated for the Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, with regards to simulation of soil moisture and temperature and the most important processes in the C and N cycles. Model sensitivity was tested for nitrogen input, precipitation, and temperature, and the choices of the most uncertain parameters were justified. A simulation of nitrogen deposition over 40 yr demonstrates the advantages of the PEATBOG model in tracking biogeochemical effects and vegetation change in the ecosystem.

AB Our study aims to elucidate how decreases in peatland above-ground net primary production (AG-NPP) might be explained by a network of relationships between some nutritive elements and the N:P ratios in different plant groups. We focused on three functional groups of peatland plants with different growth form: Sphagnum mosses, shrubs, and non-woody vascular plants (NW-VP) in an ombrotrophic peatland in northeastern Poland affected by moderate N deposition. We measured AG-NPP and elemental stoichiometry (C, N, P, Ca, Fe) in different plant species belonging to these functional plant groups, and growing within different microhabitats: Sphagnum bog hummocks and hollows, and Sphagnum mat. The functional groups significantly differed only in AG-NPP, but not in nutrient contents within the study sites. Sphagnum mosses had the highest mean production (247.6 g/m(2) ), while it was lower in NW-VP (71.7 g/m(2) ) and shrubs (49.4 g/m(2) ). The plant groups had a comparable N:P ratio. The N:P ratio was correlated with K, Ca, and Fe, but not with N in Sphagnum mosses. In NW-VP and shrubs, we observed an increased N:P ratio with increasing plant N content. However, increased N:P ratio was only negatively correlated with C content in Sphagnum mosses. Based on these data, we performed an analysis of elemental and production relations in peatland vegetation at the ecosystem level. Structural equation modelling (SEM) suggests that an increase of the N:P ratio in the vegetation, induced by higher N concentration, plus indirect effects of Fe, might explain a lower carbon concentration in plant production. As an outcome of this network of interactions, the AG-NPP of the entire peatland vegetation might be reduced.

AB An extended water regime model was used for calculating the evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and peat mineralization (CO2 and N release) for various fen locations with grassland utilization in dependence on the groundwater level. The results show that an increasing groundwater level leads to a strong decline of the actual evapotranspiration E-t. For example, increasing the groundwater level from 30 to 120 cm diminishes the E-t by up to 230 mm a(-1). A positive groundwater recharge only takes place at groundwater levels of 90 cm and more. At smaller distances the capillary rise into the rooting zone during the summer months is greater than the water seepage during the winter months, so that a negative groundwater recharge-balance is reached in the course of a year. The CO2- and the N-release, as well as the annual decline in peat thickness, increase significantly with rising groundwater levels. The results show that varying the groundwater level can influence the water regime and the peat mineralization significantly. The lower the groundwater level the less is the peat decomposition. The demand for a groundwater level as small as possible is, however; limited by an agricultural utilization of the fens. Choosing the optimum groundwater level should consider the aims (1) peat mineralization, (2) gas emission (CO2, CH4; N2O), and (3) crop production. If a grassland utilization is supposed to be made possible and all three aims above are given equal importance, the groundwater level should be maintained at 30 cm. At this distance, about 90 % of the optimum plant output can be reached. The peat mineralization can be reduced to 30 to 40 % of the maximum peat mineralization. The gas emission amounts to -50-60 % of the maximum value.

AB Question: How might contrasting plant groups interact to confer ecosystem stability during the development of a wet heath: i.e. in response to two major environmental drivers, past hydrologic change and burning?
   Location: Rannoch Moor, Scotland.
   Methods: Three peat cores were used to reconstruct vegetation change, surface moisture and burning phases, during wet heath development for a radiocarbon-dated period from ca. 9500-1000 yr BP.
   Results: Statistical analysis of peat cores revealed significant relationships between burning phases and past periods of inferred surface dryness. Vegetation elements were related in the palaeoecological record to surface dryness (Ericaceae), wetness (Sphagnum, monocotyledons, and Racomitrium) and periods of burning (i.e. negative correlation of Racomitrium and monocotyledon remains with charcoal). However, correlations between plant groups could not be adequately explained by their equivalent direct response to hydrology and burning, and the effects of species interactions are invoked.
   Conclusions: The results indicate millennial-scale stability of the wet heath ecosystem in response to past environmental change (i.e. hydrology and burning). This stability is conferred by interaction between a diversity of plant groups, enabling local shifts in vegetation composition in response to environmental drivers. This long- term stability of the mire ecosystem forms a template against which present-day threats (e. g. pollution, climate change) should be critically assessed.

AB Alkaline cupric oxide oxidation and proximate analysis were used to investigate the sources and diagenetic state of organic matter in six Sphagmum-dominated peatlands located between Alberta, Canada, and Ohio, U.S.A. Cupric oxide oxidation was also used to characterize vascular and nonvascular wetland plant species to provide a specific biological fingerprint of these plant tissues. Oxidation of 15 species of Sphagnum moss released large quantities of unsubstituted p-hydroxyl phenolic compounds as well as the species specific sphagnum acid (p-hydroxy-beta-[carboxymethyl]-cinnamic acid). By contrast, vascular plant tissues released large amounts of lignin oxidation products. Cupric oxide oxidation of Sphagnum peat from more northerly sites produced mainly p-hydroxyl phenolic monomers with lesser amounts of vascular lignin derived phenols. in contrast, southern sites and those dominated by woody vegetation produced oxidation products characteristic of vascular plant lignin. A distinct relationship exists between the amount of acid-insoluble Klason lignin and both the diagenetically sensitive phenolic acid to aldehyde ratios as well as the total yield of vanillyl phenolic oxidation products. We found evidence of selective decay of phenolic lignin precursors. These relationships indicate the lignin component in surficial layers of Sphagnum-dominated peat is influenced by both Sphagnum and vascular plant lignin, and the structure of lignin appears to undergo diagenetic changes in these layers. Application of an end-member mixing model revealed that lignin oxidation products poorly predicted vegetational composition of the lignin in more decomposed peat, probably as a result of selective decay of lignin structural phenols.

AB The ash thickness formed above the combustion front of peat, which is affected by the inorganic content and the piled bed height of peat column, plays both positive and negative effects on peat smouldering fires. This work investigated the effects of the inorganic content and the piled bed height (5, 10 and 20 cm) on the natural downward smouldering mechanism of peat, both experimentally and numerically. It was observed that the char formation and char oxidation processes are stable and dominant during the downward smouldering. The spread rate of the pyrolysis front was found to decrease almost linearly with the inorganic content, while the spread rate of the char oxidation front was less dependent on the inorganic content and the piled bed height at higher inorganic content. The spread rate of the char oxidation front levelled off when the ash layer above the char layer was thick enough, which was also well-predicted by a 1-D numerical model. The model also predicted the nonlinearly increasing peak temperature and decreasing downward spread rate with depths in experiments. This work provides a better understanding of the multiple role of inorganic content in peat smouldering fires, especially for the fires in the in-depth peat layer with abundant inorganics in natural peatlands.

AB Dutch peatlands have been subsiding due to peat decomposition, shrinkage and compression, since their reclamation in the 11th century. Currently, subsidence amounts to 1-2 cm/year. Water management in these areas is complex and costly, greenhouse gases are being emitted, and surface water quality is relatively poor. Regional and local authorities and landowners responsible for peatland management have recognized these problems. In addition, the Netherlands Royal Meteorological Institute predicts higher temperatures and drier summers, which both are expected to enhance peat decomposition. Stakeholder workshops have been organized in three case study areas in the province of Friesland to exchange knowledge on subsidence and explore future subsidence rates and the effects of land use and management changes on subsidence rates. Subsidence rates were up to 3 cm/year in deeply drained parcels and increased when we included climate change in the modeling exercises. This means that the relatively thin peat layers in this province (ca 1 m) would shrink or even disappear by the end of the century when current practices continue. Adaptation measures were explored, such as extensive dairy farming and the production of new crops in wetter conditions, but little experience has been gained on best practices. The workshops have resulted in useful exchange of ideas on possible measures and their consequences for land use and water management in the three case study areas. The province and the regional water board will use the results to develop land use and water management policies for the next decades.

AB Pb-210-dated ombrotrophic peat cores have been widely used to reconstruct the atmospheric fluxes of heavy metals for the past century. Many of these studies rarely include the overlying vegetation compartment (i.e., the aerial part of vegetation and decayed plant remains) in the analysis although it represents the first layer capturing atmospheric deposition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the radionuclide and Pb content of this biologically active layer in bogs and to assess its implications on the total inventories and the Pb-210-derived chronology. We analyzed two short ombrotrophic peat cores from the same bog (Chao de Lamoso, Galicia, Spain) for Pb-210, artificial radionuclides (Cs-137 and Am-241), and Pb. The total Pb inventory was underestimated by about 12% when the plant material was not included in the record. The atmospheric origin of Pb-210 and the uptake of Cs-137 by roots led to significant activities of these radionuclides in the upper layers. Therefore, removing them from the peat record would imply even larger underestimations of the total inventories, ranging from 25% to 36% for Cs-137 and from 39% to 49% for Pb-210. In contrast to the chronologies inferred from the constant rate of supply (CIRS) model when only peat layers are considered, the Pb-210 chronology agreed well with artificial radionuclide dating when surface vegetation was included. These results suggest that an accurate peat chronology requires an initial evaluation of the relevance of plant inventories and emphasizes the need of considering the biologically active layer when atmospheric fluxes of heavy metals and other pollutants are reconstructed.

In this study, a dynamic closed chamber technique was used to examine the relative midday (10:00-16:00 h) growing season (April-October) contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration (R-tot) and moss photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, GEP) to net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 at the soil surface of different degrees of spruce forest canopy cover and microtopography (lawn and depression) in two peatland-pond complexes in the WBP, north-central Alberta, Canada. Results demonstrate that Sphagnum lawns showed the greatest amount of uptake, and dominant surface cover plant communities (Sphagnum and feather mosses) were associated more with canopy cover and incident radiation (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) than microclimate and hydrology. Although microclimate and hydrology varied spatially, no major changes in plant communities were observed across microtopographic gradients (lawns and depression). Differences in NEE with hydrology and microclimate were observed between microtopographic units (depression and lawns), but this was not consistent with surface cover plant community types, which makes generalized fluxes in this landscape particularly challenging.

DT Article
DE exchangeable cations; heavy metals; Histic Gleysols; Histic Podzols;
   Histosols
AB The chemical properties of surface peat cover (SPC) were studied in the context of Estonian pedoecological conditions. SPC comprises the superficial layers of fens (Group 1) and transitional bogs (Group 2), together with slightly acid peaty mull / strongly acid peaty moder (Group 3) and very strongly acid peaty mor (Group 4) layers overlying mineral soils. Thus, it spans organic soils, namely Histosols (Groups 1 and 2); together with Histic Gleysols (Group 3) and Histic Podzols (Group 4), which are developmentally intermediate between organic and mineral soils. Moderately acid eutrophic (Group 1) and very strongly acid mesotrophic (Group 2) peats (forest litter layers excluded) were uniformly characterised up to 40 cm depth; whereas for Groups 3 and 4 we examined the full thickness of available peat layers, which ranged from 10 to 30 cm. The results show that Al, K and heavy metal contents are significantly higher and organic carbon content is lower in Histic Soils (3, 4) than in Histosols (1, 2). The amounts of Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe are significantly higher and C: N ratio, exchangeable acidity and content of free H+ lower in less acidic (1, 3) than in more acidic (2, 4) soil types. The total concentration of elements (excluding heavy metals) extracted by nitro-hydrochloric acid (aqua regia) is considerably higher in less acidic soils, at 28-45 g kg(-1) (1, 3) versus 10-12 g kg(-1) (2, 4); and mean contents of individual elements decrease in the order Ca(51%) > Fe(20%) > S(10%) >= Al(10%) > Mg(3%) >= P(3%) > K(2%) > Mn(1%) > Na(< 1%). The most abundant heavy metals are Pb (12-33 mg kg(-1)), Zn (7-41 mg kg(-1)), Cu (3-12 mg kg(-1)), Cr (2-23 mg kg(-1)) and Ni (2-8 mg kg(-1)); Cd and Hg contents are very low, ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 mg kg(-1). The dominant exchangeable basic cations are Ca2+ (78-93%) and Mg2+ (7-15%), and the peat contains much smaller amounts of K+ (1-6%) and Na+ (<2%). The total exchangeable acidic cations (1-14 cmol kg(-1)) are dominated by H+ (51-83%) and Al3+ (15-47%), whereas Mn and Fe (2-4%) cations are modestly represented.

AB Soil biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) represents a major pathway through which nitrogen enters pristine peatlands. Many peatlands have been undergoing human-induced changes in environmental factors, while environmental changes dramatically affect the community composition and activity of nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes (i.e., diazotrophs). However, the impact of peatland degradation on soil BNF remains unclear. By carrying out a field campaign, we examined how soil BNF varies along a natural gradient from pristine marshes to moderately-degraded meadows and sandy meadows on the Zoige Plateau. Plant and topsoil samples from four pristine marshes, three moderately-degraded meadows, and three sandy meadows were collected to determine the potential rate of nitrogen fixation (R-Nfix), abundance of the nifH gene, diazotrophic community composition, and soil and plant characteristics. Our results showed that topsoil R-Nfix varied in the range 0.018-3.00 mu mol N g d.w.(-1) day(-1) (i.e. 21.74-1632.37 mg N m(-2) day(-1)) across the ten sites, being lowest in sandy meadows and highest in pristine marshes. Topsoil R-Nfix and diazotrophic abundance were positively correlated with soil water content, sedge cover, plant biomass, soil organic carbon content, and total nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Soil water content, which affected most plant and soil characteristics, had dominant influences on the abundance and community structure of diazotrophs. The R-Nfix was closely correlated with the abundance of dominant diazotroph groups. The community composition of diazotrophs differed markedly among sites of different degradation levels. Proteobacteria was the most abundant diazotrophic phylum across the ten sites. Heterotrophic diazotrophs acted as the major contributor to BNF, especially in pristine marshes and moderately-degraded meadows. We conclude that soil water content was the main factor driving the depressed soil BNF during peatland degradation in Zoige, due to soil water effects on plant cover and biomass, soil organic carbon and total phosphorus, and the abundance and community structure of diazotrophs.

AB This study compares hydrologic investigations of four New York fens designed to characterize spatial variability in groundwater flow (GWF) and the resulting hydrochemical patterns that influence plant nutrient availability. At the mart fen and two rich fen sites, hydrometric data and pore water samples collected from nested piezometers set along the GWF-path showed spatial patterns consistent with a mixing gradient established by the intersection of local (i.e., hill slope), relatively dilute groundwater discharge and mineral-rich groundwater discharged from a larger-scaled (i.e., intermediate) system. Distinct redox and carbonate gradients along the GWF-paths of three rich fens reflected strong interactions between groundwater supply of terminal electron acceptors and microbial processes affecting speciation of iron, nitrogen and phosphorus. Decreased nitrate concentrations, increased dissolved iron, and removal of sulfate along flowpaths indicated that redox conditions became more reduced as groundwater moved down-gradient. Nitrate removal occurred across the interface between the upland mineral soil and the organic-rich fen peat. Lack of ammonium accumulation indicated that denitrification limits N-supply to plants in down-gradient fen areas. Further down-gradient, sulfate-enriched groundwater discharge sustained sub-oxic conditions and enhanced phosphorus mobility through effects on iron-sulfur-phosphorus dynamics, alkalinity generation, and dissolution of mineral-bound P. In contrast, the poor fen was sustained by an isolated surficial groundwater system; a thick lacustrine clay aquitard limited intermediate or regional-scaled groundwater discharge. As a result, water table fluctuations were more responsive to short-term weather events and imposed the strongest influence on redox status. A redox gradient, evidenced by increasing iron and ammonium concentrations, extended downward with depth from the aerated peat surface. The dilute water supply and tack of additional internal alkalinity generation limited buffer capacity and decomposition. Overall, ammonium accumulation increased N-availability whereas reduced decomposition rates further limited P availability. Our results show that interaction of multiple GWF systems within the fens was the critical determinant of water table stability (rich fens) or fluctuation (poor fen), as well as the supply of dissolved ions that influence geochemical processes affecting plant nutrient availability. Together these factors accounted directly or indirectly for observed spatial patterns in redox and alkalinity gradients, which in turn controlled speciation of phosphorus-reactive minerals. Differences among fens in spatial patterns could be accounted for by differences in the geomorphometry of the basins within which the fens developed and the stratigraphy and hydraulic characteristics of underlying sediments. Results suggest that Fe-S dynamics, rather than carbonate precipitation, likely influences inorganic phosphorus pools and release mechanisms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SCALING BEHAVIOR; PEATLAND; REGIME; RECORD
AB Atmospheric pollutants and environmental indicators are often used to reconstruct historic atmospheric pollution from peat, as it accumulates over time by decomposing plant material, thus recording a history of air pollution. In the present study, three key parameters related to the peat bogs' surface wetness dynamics in European Russia during the Holocene were investigated using modern statistical analysis. These parameters are: (i) the water table depth (WTD) in relation to the surface, which is reconstructed based on the community structure of the subfossil testate amoeba assemblages; (ii) the peat humification estimated as absorption of alkaline extract that directly reflects moisture at which the peat was formed; (iii) the Climate Moisture Index (CMI) and the Aridity Index derived from pollen-based reconstructions of the mean annual temperature and precipitation and classifying moisture conditions as the ratio between available annual precipitation and potential land surface evapotranspiration. All these parameters provide useful information about the paleoclimate (atmospheric moisture component) dynamics. High values of WTD and peat humification appear to comply with Gutenberg-Richter law. It is noteworthy that this law also seems to reproduce the high values of the modeled climate moisture and aridity indices. The validity of this new result is checked by replacing "conventional time" with "natural time". On this basis, a new nowcasting tool is developed to more accurately estimate the average waiting time for the extreme values of these climate parameters. This will help to understand climate variability better to address emerging development needs and priorities by implementing empirical studies of the interactions between climatic effects, mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable growth.

AB The present study was conducted to (i) investigate parameters influencing the fluxes of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) in Danish riparian wetlands with contrasting vegetation characteristics and (ii) develop models relating CH4 emissions to soil and/or vegetation parameters integrating the spatial and temporal variability in the fluxes. Fluxes of CH4 were monitored in 12 wetland plots Over a year using static chambers, yielding a dataset with more than 800 measured fluxes of CH4. Yearly emissions of CH4 ranged from -0.2 to 38.3 g CH4-C m(-2) year(-1), and significant effects of groundwater level, soil temperature (10cm depth), peat depth, sulfate, nitrate, and soil carbon content were found. Two methods based on easily available environmental parameters to estimate yearly CH4 emissions from riparian wetlands are presented. The first uses a generalized linear model (GLM) to predict yearly CH4 emissions based on the humidity preference of vegetation (Ellenberg-F), peat depth and degree of humification of the peat (von Post index). The second method relies solely on plant species composition and uses weighted-average regression and calibration to link the vegetation assemblage to yearly CH4 emission. Both models gave reliable predictions of the yearly CH4 fluxes in riparian wetlands (modeling efficiency > 0.35). Our findings support the use of vegetation, possibly in combination with some soil parameters such as peat depth, as indicator of CH4 emission in wetlands. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The content and the profile distribution of the element composition of the 1 meter high peat deposits in flat frost mound bogs are investigated. The botanical composition of peat is described. The results of the botanical composition analysis of peat showed that deposits consist mainly of sphagnum mosses, lichens, shrubs, green mosses, pine wood, as well as pine and birch bark. A good correlation between the degree of peat decomposition and the brightness of dry peat measured by the CIE L(star)a(star)b(star) color model is revealed. As a result of the study of peat samples' color, it has been found that this parameter can be used as an express method for the rapid assessment of peat degree decomposition. The highest concentration of the organic carbon occurs at the base of the peat deposit (64.4 +/- 0.2%). The nitrogen concentration in permafrost peat is higher than in thawed (1.0 +/- 0.2% and 0.7 +/- 0.1%, respectively, the difference is significant at p = 0.001). The C / N ratio decreases from 72 +/- 16 in 0-40 cm in the thawed layer to 50 +/- 10 in the frozen part (40-100 cm). Within the bottom low boundary of the seasonally thawed layer, a local increase in the N concentration was detected, as well as an almost 2-fold decrease in the C / N ratio. It is most likely related to the high increase in the rate of microbial activity on the border between the thawed layer and the permafrost peat. It was revealed that most of the elements are concentrated in the upper (thawed) part of the peat deposit. Among them, only Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Ba, As and Sb have a significant difference. Despite the fact that significant differences according to non-parametric U-criterion Mann-Whitney test were identified only for 7 elements, the distribution of the rest along elements the frozen and thawed peat layer is similar in nature. So for Na, Mg, Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, Fe, Zn, Ba, Li, B, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Ga, As, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sb, Cs, the upper quartiles of concentrations in the seasonally thawed layer are 1.2-6.9 times higher than in the permafrost peat, and for C, N, Al, Ba, B, V, Co, Cu, Zr, Nb, Mo it is 1,0-0,6 times lower, respectively. Generally, according to the element composition, it is safe to say that the differences stem from the botanical composition. In general, according to the elemental composition it can be said that the differences are primarily due to the botanical composition. The active layer comprises mainly sphagnum mosses and lichens, the woody peat already appears in the lower permafrost part of the deposit. A correlation between the brightness of peat and the total content of ash elements (R2 = 0.65, excluding 1 sample) was revealed within the active layer. Taking into account the fact that the brightness correlates with the degree of decomposition, it may be concluded that higher upper quartile of the concentrations of elements in the active layer relates to the slower peat accumulation rate for the last 3 thousand years and, correspondingly, a large accumulation of dust components from the atmosphere by the peat layers.

AB Previous studies have shown that the floristic composition of northern peatlands provides important information regarding ecosystem processes and their responses to environmental change. Remote sensing is the most expeditious method of obtaining floristic information at landscape and regional scales, but the spatial complexity of many northern peatlands and the spectral similarity of a number of peatland vegetation species is such that the success of traditional methods of vegetation classification is often limited. Here, we assessed whether ordination and regression analyses may be a useful alternative method for mapping peatland plant communities from remote sensing data. We used isometric feature mapping (Isomap) to describe the community structure of the peatland vegetation and related the identified continuous floristic gradients to hyperspectral imagery (AEA Eagle) using partial least squares regression (PLSR). We performed the same analysis at two hierarchical levels of species aggregation in order to map continuous gradients in the composition of both species and plant functional types (PFTs), the latter of which is the most widely used level of aggregation in northern ecosystems. Isomap was able to transfer 82% and more than 96% of the observed ground-based observations to the ordination space for plots characterised by species and PFT; respectively. The modelled floristic gradients showed good agreement with ground-based species and PFT observations although the strength of the agreement was proportional to the amount of floristic variation explained by each ordination axis (r(val)(2) = 0.74, 0.45 and 030 for the first three ordination axes and r(val)(2) = 0.68 and 0.66 for the first two ordination axes; for species and PFT floristic gradients respectively). We also found that how a PVC is defined has an important influence on the success with which it can be mapped. The resultant mapped floristic gradients enabled visualisation of homogeneous vegetation stands, heterogeneous mixtures of different key species and PFTs, and the presence of continuous and abrupt floristic transitions, without the need for unique spectral signatures or the collection of data characterising ancillary environmental variables.

AB The elemental and structural-group compositions and paramagnetic properties of the humic acids of peat occurring at different depths of peat deposits of various geneses have been investigated. With decreasing the depth of peat occurrence, the extracted humic acids were characterized by a decrease in the H/C ratio and the amount of carboxyl and methylene groups and an increase in the signal intensity of organic paramagnetic centers (PMCs), which indicated an increase in the aromatic conjugation structure. The change in the amount of PMCs in the humic acids of peat along the depth of a deposit was directly dependent on the Fe(3+)content.

AB Holocene sediment profile from a paludified near-shore area of Lake Kuzi (Vidzeme Heights, Central Latvia) was investigated using lithological and palaeobotanical (pollen and macrofossil analysis) methods and accelerator mass spectrometry AMS C-14 dating. The results of this first comprehensive study of a Holocene sediment core from the Vidzeme Heights indicate that at the beginning of the Early and at the end of the Late Holocene the lake level was low and fen peat accumulated around the lake. From ca. 9000 BP tip to 1500 BP the mire was flooded and gyttja with interlayers of sand and peat accumulated. The water level fluctuations are clearly represented in the lithological succession and pollen spectra. We compared the L. Kuzi pollen diagram with well-studied sites from the Haanja Heights, which have a similar genesis. The most obvious difference in these diagram.,; is the earlier appearance (9200 BP) of Picea pollen in the L. Kuzi profile and its dominance up to 1000 BP. Comparative analysis of the lithology and pollen spectra from L. Kuzi and reference profiles from the Haanja Heights indicate the importance of broad regional factors in influencing the pollen spectra.

AB Coal seams preserve high-resolution records of ancient terrestrial water table (base level) fluctuations in ancient peat accumulations, but little is known about base level change in anomalously thick coal seams. Using the Early Cretaceous 91 m anomalously thick No. 6 coal (lignite) seam in the Erlian Basin (north-east China) as a case study, the origin and evolution of peat accumulation in a continental faulted basin is revealed by sedimentological, sequence stratigraphic and coal petrological analyses. The lignite is dominated by huminite, indicating oxygen-deficient and waterlogged conditions in the precursor mire. Four types of key sequence stratigraphic surfaces are recognized, including paludification, terrestrialization, accommodation-reversal and give-up transgressive surfaces. Vertically, the No. 6 coal seam consists of fourteen superimposed wetting-up and drying-up cycles separated by key sequence stratigraphic surfaces, with each of these cycles having a mean duration of about 156 to 173 kyr. In a high accommodation peat swamp system, the wetting-up cycles are generally characterized by an upward increase in mineral matter and inertodetrinite and an upward decrease in huminite with the paludification surface as their base and the give-up transgressive surface or accommodation-reversal surface as their top, representing a trend of upward-increasing accommodation. In contrast, the drying-up cycles are generally characterized by an upward decrease in mineral matter and inertodetrinite and an upward increase in huminite, with the terrestrialization surface as their base and the accommodation-reversal surface as their top, representing a trend of upward-decreasing accommodation. A multi-phase mire stacking model for accumulation of the coal seam is proposed based on high-frequency accommodation cycles and the stratigraphic relationships between coal and clastic sediments. High-frequency accommodation cycles in the coal are closely related to water table fluctuations in the precursor mires and are driven by high-frequency climate via changes in the intensity and seasonality of precipitation in a relatively stable subsidence regime. Recognition that the No. 6 coal seam is composed of multiple stacked mires has implications for studies addressing palaeoclimatic inferences and genesis of anomalously thick coals seams.

AB Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) is the dominant form of mercury in the atmosphere. Its conversion into oxidized gaseous and particulate forms is thought to drive atmospheric mercury wet deposition to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, where it can be subsequently transformed into toxic methylmercury. The contribution of mercury dry deposition is however largely unconstrained. Here we examine mercury mass balance and mercury stable isotope composition in a peat bog ecosystem. We find that isotope signatures of living sphagnum moss (Delta Hg-199 = -0.11 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand, Delta Hg-200 = 0.03 +/- 0.02 parts per thousand, 1 sigma) and recently accumulated peat (Delta Hg-199 = -0.22 +/- 0.06 parts per thousand, Delta Hg-200 = 0.00 +/- 0.04 parts per thousand, 1 sigma) are characteristic of GEM (Delta Hg-199 = -0.17 +/- 0.07 parts per thousand, Delta Hg-200 = -0.05 +/- 0.02 parts per thousand, 1 sigma), and differs from wet deposition (Delta Hg-199 = 0.73 +/- 0.15 parts per thousand, Delta Hg-200 = 0.21 +/- 0.04 parts per thousand, 1 sigma). Sphagnum covered during three years by transparent and opaque surfaces, which eliminate wet deposition, continue to accumulate Hg. Sphagnum Hg isotope signatures indicate accumulation to take place by GEM dry deposition, and indicate little photochemical re -emission. We estimate that atmospheric mercury deposition to the peat bog surface is dominated by GEM dry deposition (79%) rather than wet deposition (21%). Consequently, peat deposits are potential records of past atmospheric GEM concentrations and isotopic composition.

AB The peat sequence at Hani in northeastern China accumulated over the past 16 cal kyr in a percolation mire in which rain water and ground water seeped through the peat system. The molecular compositions of n-alkanes, n-alkanols, and n-alkanoic acids extracted from the Hani peat sequence reveal different responses to the progressive evolution of climate and changes in the nature of the peat-forming vegetation. Long chain length components that originate from the waxy coatings of subaerial vascular plants dominate the n-alkane distributions throughout the Hani peat sequence. The paleoclimate integrity of these biomarker molecules appears to be well preserved. Most of the n-alkanol distributions are similarly dominated by long chain components that indicate their origins from subaerial plants. In contrast, n-alkanoic acid distributions are dominated by secondary components that record the importance of post-depositional microbial activity in this peat sequence, which evidently can be extensive in a percolation mire.
   Elevated n-alkane P(aq) values and C(23)/C(29) ratios, which are both molecular proxies for water-loving plants, record an especially moist local climate in the Bolling-Allerod (14.5 to 12.9 ka), Younger Dryas (12.9 to 11.5 ka), and Pre-Boreal (11.5 to 10.5 ka) portions of the Hard peat sequence. Depressed P(aq) values and C(23)/C(29) ratios and larger n-alkane average chain length values indicate that the Holocene Climatic Optimum (10.5 to 6 ka) was a period of warmer climate with lower effective precipitation, which contrasts with evidence of wetter climates in most of East Asia.

AB Studying the peatlands accumulation and carbon (C) storage in monsoonal areas could provide useful insights into the response of C dynamics to climate variation in the geological past. Here, we integrated 40 well-dated peat/lake sediment cores to reveal the peatlands evolution history in the Sanjiang Plain and examine its links to East Asian monsoon variations during the Holocene. The results show that 80% peatlands in the Sanjiang Plain initiated after 4.7 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP), with the largest initiating frequency around 4.5 ka. The mean C accumulation rate of peatlands in the Sanjiang Plain exhibits a synchronous increase with the peatlands expansion during the Holocene. Such a peatlands expanding and C accumulating pattern corresponds well to the remarkable drying event subsequent to the Holocene monsoon maximum. We suggest that in addition to the locally topographic conditions, Holocene variations of East Asian summer monsoon (especially its associated precipitation) have played a critical role in driving the peatlands initiation and expansion in the Sanjiang Plain.

AB Microbial activity and enzymic decomposition processes were followed during a field-based experimental lowering of the water table in a Welsh peatland. Respiration was not significantly affected by the treatment. However, the enzymes sulphatase, beta-glucosidase and phosphatase were stimulated by between 31 and 67% upon water table drawdown. A further enzyme, phenol oxidase, was not significantly affected. The observation of elevated enzyme activities without an associated increase in microbial respiratory activity suggests that drought conditions influence peatland mineralisation rates through a direct stimulation of existing enzymes, rather than through a generalised stimulation of microbial metabolism (with associated de-novo enzyme synthesis). Hydrochemical data suggest that the stimulation may have been caused by a reduction in the inhibitory action of iron and phenolics in the peat pore waters. Overall, the findings support the recent hypothesis that drier conditions associated with climate change could stimulate mineralisation within wetlands.

AB Unveiling past tipping points is a prerequisite for a better understanding of how individual species and entire ecosystems will respond to future climate change. Such knowledge is key for the implementation of biodiversity conservation. We identify the relationships between peatland vegetation and hydrological conditions over the past 2000 years using plant macrofossils, testate amoebae-based quantitative hydrological reconstructions and Sphagnum-moss functional traits from seven Polish peatland records. Using threshold indicator taxa analysis, we discovered that plant community composition strongly converged at a water level of ca 11.7 cm, indicating a community-level tipping point. We identified 45 plant taxa that showed either an increase or a decrease in their relative abundance between 8 and 17 cm of water-level depth. Our analysis of Sphagnum community traits further showed that Sphagnum functional diversity was remarkably stable over time despite Sphagnum species sensitivity to hydrological conditions. Our results suggest that past hydrological shifts did not influence major functions of the Sphagnum community, such as photosynthetic capacity, growth and productivity, owing to species replacement with a similar functional space. Although further studies including trait plasticity will be required, our findings suggest that the capacity of the Sphagnum community to gain carbon remained stable despite hydrological changes.

AB Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide was measured at treeline forest and fen tundra sites near Churchill, Canada during three consecutive growing seasons (1997-1999). Although both sites demonstrated a net uptake of CO2 in each of the years, there was considerable variation in the flux between sites and between years. Mean daily NEE at the forest varied from -1.5 (+/-0.25 SD) g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1997 to -7.3 (+/-0.39) g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1999. The fen mean daily NEE varied from -1.1 (+/-0.36) g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1997 to -3.1 (+/-0.50) g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1998. Integrated over the 65-d measurement period the forest was a net sink of -100, -313, and -478 g CO2 m(-2) in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively, and the fen net sink was -73, -202, and -38 g CO2 m(-2), respectively. Interannual variations in the fen NEE were closely related to water table draw-down (soil wetness), the forest NEE was unaffected by water table change. The forest seasonally cumulative NEE was closely associated with timing of snowmelt and accumulated heat content prior to leaf-out. Earlier snowmelt and greater heat accumulation produced a larger growing season sink. It is likely these events also influenced the fen NEE, but the relationship is complicated by water table effects. These results suggest that carbon dioxide exchange varies considerably across the northern treeline, and that there may be an important biospheric feedback between climate warming, treeline advance, and carbon cycling.

AB The revegetation of islands following retreat of Pleistocene glaciers is of great biogeographical interest. The San Juan Islands, Washington, feature regionally distinctive xerophytic plant communities, yet their vegetation history, as it relates to past climate and sea level, is poorly known. We describe a 13,700-year-old pollen record from Killebrew Lake Fen and compare the vegetation reconstruction with others from the region. The data suggest that the narrow channels surrounding Orcas Island were not a barrier to early postglacial immigration of plants. Between 13,700 and 12,000 cal yr BP, Pinus, Tsuga, Picea, Alnus viridis, and possibly Juniperus maritima were present in a mosaic that supported Bison antiquus and Megalonyx. The rise of Alnus rubra-type pollen and Pteridium spores at ca. 12,000 cal yr BP suggests a warming trend and probably more fires. Temperate conifer taxa, including Cupressaceae, Pseudotsuga, Tsuga heterophylla, and Abies, increased after 11,000 cal yr BP and especially in the last 7000 cal yr BP. After 6000 cal yr BP, Pseudotsuga and Cupressaceae dominated the vegetation. The last 1500 yr were the wettest period of the record. Due to its rain shadow location, Orcas Island experienced drier conditions than on the mainland during most of the postglacial period. (C) 2016 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

LA English
DT Article
DE black spruce; boreal forest; climate change; hydraulic stress; sap flow;
   water potential
AB Boreal peatland forests have relatively low species diversity and thus impacts of climate change on one or more dominant species could shift ecosystem function. Despite abundant soil water availability, shallowly rooted vascular plants within peatlands may not be able to meet foliar demand for water under drought or heat events that increase vapor pressure deficits while reducing near surface water availability, although concurrent increases in atmospheric CO2 could buffer resultant hydraulic stress. We assessed plant water relations of co-occurring shrub (primarily Rhododendron groenlandicum and Chamaedaphne calyculata) and tree (Picea mariana and Larix laricina) species prior to, and in response to whole ecosystem warming (0 to +9 degrees C) and elevated CO2 using 12.8-m diameter open-top enclosures installed within an ombrotrophic bog. Water relations (water potential [psi], turgor loss point, foliar and root hydraulic conductivity) were assessed prior to treatment initiation, then psi and peak sap flow (trees only) assessed after 1 or 2 years of treatments. Under the higher temperature treatments, L. laricina psi exceeded its turgor loss point, increased its peak sap flow, and was not able to recover psi overnight. In contrast, P. mariana operated below its turgor loss point and maintained constant psi and sap flow across warming treatments. Similarly, C. calyculata psi stress increased with temperature while R. groenlandicum psi remained at pretreatment levels. The more anisohydric behavior of L. laricina and C. calyculata may provide greater net C uptake with warming, while the more conservative P. mariana and R. groenlandicum maintained greater hydraulic safety. These latter species also responded to elevated CO2 by reduced psi stress, which may also help limit hydraulic failure during periods of extreme drought or heat in the future. Along with Sphagnum moss, the species-specific responses of peatland vascular communities to drier or hotter conditions will shape boreal peatland composition and function in the future.

AB Although root litter contributes to a large extent to soil organic matter accumulation in peatlands, decomposition of root litter is often neglected in studies on litter decomposition and carbon and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. In this study, decomposition of root and rhizome litter of Carex diandra and Carex lasiocarpa was determined in two temperate fens, one dominated by Sphagnum species (Sphagnum, fen; soil pH = 4.4) and one without a Sphagnum cover Carex fen: soil pH = 5.7. One-year mass loss increased in the order: roots Carex diandra < roots Carex lasiocarpa < rhizomes Carex lasiocarpa. This ranking was in agreement with the generally established relationships between decomposition rate and litter chemistry, since rhizome litter had the lowest concentration of lignin and the highest nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. The decomposition constants (k-values) varied from 0.10 to 0.30 yr(-1), which is at the low end of the range found for above-ground litter of Carex species in other studies. Decomposition rates of root litter were lower in the Sphagnum site than in the Carex site, probably as a result of a lower pH and a lower nutrient status in the Sphragnum site. At both sites, N and P content of the litter decreased rapidly in the first three months indicating fast nutrient leaching and mineralization. Nutrient release per unit initial litter mass in the Carex site did not differ from that in the Sphagnum site. Estimated first year losses of N and P from Carex diandra roots in the Carex site were 2.31 g N m(-2) and 0.20 g P m(-2) First-pear nutrient losses From leaf litter of this species, as determined in another study, were only 0.06 g N m(-2) and 0.02 g P m(-2). These results show that roots do indeed play a major role in the cycling of carbon and nutrients in temperate fen ecosystems.

AB In this study, Holocene humification records were derived from four ombrotrophic peatlands to investigate the millennial-scale and decadal-centennial-scale variability of peat decomposition and to explore the paleoclimatic and paleohydrological implications. After eliminating the species-specific and site-specific noise and removing the time-dependency effect for each of four peat sequences, the averaged residuals of four peat humification sequences exhibit two-order variations. The millennial-scale variation of averaged residuals of four peat humification is characterized by a bow-shaped curve and is basically moisture-dependent. In detail, the humification in the middle Holocene (similar to 8200-similar to 4000 cal. yr BP) was higher than in the early Holocene (before similar to 8200 cal. yr BP) and also than in the late Holocene (after similar to 4000 cal. yr BP). The decadal/centennial-scale variations are superimposed on the bow-shaped curve and have been primarily paced by the sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic whose signals were propagated to Central Asia via the prevailing westerlies, which implies that lower temperature and lower temperature-suppressed evaporation (i.e. elevated moisture level) were most likely responsible for limiting the decomposition activity in the uppermost peat layer. These results indicate the potential for humification records from ombrotrophic peatlands in Central Asia to elucidate paleoclimate variability.

AB Satellite Earth Observation (EO) is often used as a cost-effective method to report on the condition of remote and inaccessible peatland areas. Current EO techniques are primarily limited to reporting on the vegetation classes and properties of the immediate peat surface using optical data, which can be used to infer peatland condition. Another useful indicator of peatland condition is that of surface motion, which has the potential to report on mass accumulation and loss of peat. Interferometic SAR (InSAR) techniques can provide this using data from space. However, the most common InSAR techniques for information extraction, such as Persistent Scatterers' Interferometry (PSI), have seen limited application over peat as they are primarily tuned to work in areas of high coherence (i.e., on hard, non-vegetated surfaces only). A new InSAR technique, called the Intermittent Small BAseline Subset (ISBAS) method, has been recently developed to provide measurements over vegetated areas from SAR data acquired by satellite sensors. This paper examines the feasibility of the ISBAS technique for monitoring long-term surface motion over peatland areas of the Flow Country, in the northeast of Scotland. In particular, the surface motions estimated are compared with ground data over a small forested area (namely the Bad a Cheo forest Reserve). Two sets of satellite SAR data are used: ERS C-band images, covering the period 1992-2000, and Sentinel-1 C-band images, covering the period 2015-2016. We show that the ISBAS measurements are able to identify surface motion over peatland areas, where subsidence is a consequence of known land cover/land use. In particular, the ISBAS products agree with the trend of surface motion, but there are uncertainties with their magnitude and direction (vertical). It is concluded that there is a potential for the ISBAS method to be able to report on trends in subsidence and uplift over peatland areas, and this paper suggests avenues for further investigation, but this requires a well-resourced validation campaign.

AB The ongoing pressures of climate change, as expressed by the increased intensity, duration, and frequency of temperature and precipitation events, threatens the storage of carbon in northern latitudes. One key concern is how these events will affect the production, mobilization, and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the main form of aquatic carbon export in these regions. In this study, we retrospectively show contrasting effects of climate extremes over 23 years on two adjacent boreal catchments, one dominated by forest cover and the other draining a mire (wetland), despite experiencing the same extreme climate events. During the peak snowmelt, DOC concentrations ranged from 20 to 33 mg l(-1) in the forest catchment and 10-28 mg l(-1) in the mire catchment respectively, highlighting large inter-annual variation in the springtime hydrologicCexport at both sites. Weused climate and discharge variables to predict this variation, and found that DOC from the forested catchment, which is derived largely from riparian soils, had the highest concentrations following cold summers, dry autumns, and winters with high precipitation. By contrast, in the mire outlet, where DOC is primarily derived from decomposing peat, the highest DOC concentrations in the spring followed cold/dry winters and dry summers. Our results indicate that processes regulating stream DOC concentrations during spring in both catchments were dependent on both temperature and precipitation in multiple seasons. Together, these patterns suggest that DOC responses to climatic extremes are complex and generate variable patterns in springtime concentrations that are strongly dependent upon landscape context.

AB Our aim in this study was to evaluate whether coverage change in the vegetation of a forestry buffer wetland can be used to reveal a possible increase in nutrients. To achieve this, we followed changes in vegetation on two peatland buffers, and biomass with nitrogen content in one of them. Nutrient concentrations were periodically lower in the water inflow than in the outflow. Flooding caused a species change in favor of flood-tolerant grasses and Sphagna, but this species composition did not indicate a higher trophic level. Nitrogen content in the reference site's original surface peat layer, which was rich in woody remains, was higher than that of the newly formed, more acidic Sphagnum peat of the spruce swamp buffer. Changes in biomass did not indicate an increased nutrient-binding capacity of the spruce swamp buffer vegetation. On the other hand, the changes in species cover outlined the area of effective water flow paths within the buffer and suggested that severe eutrophication of peatland forestry buffers does not seem likely.

AB An 18-month reciprocal peat transplant experiment was conducted between two peatlands in the Czech Republic. Both sites were 100% Sphagnum-covered, with no vascular plants, and no hummocks and hollows. Atmospheric depositions of sulfur were up to 10 times higher at the northern site Velke jerabi jezero (VJJ), compared to the southern site Cervene blato (CB). Forty-cm deep peat cores, 10-cm in diameter, were used as transplants and controls in five replicates. Our objective was to evaluate whether CO2 and CH4 emissions from Sphagnum peat bogs are governed mainly by organic matter quality in the substrate, or by environmental conditions. Emission rates and delta C-13 values of CO2 and CH4 were measured in the laboratory at time t=18 months. All measured parameters converged to those of the host site, indicating that, at least in the short-term perspective, environmental conditions were a more important control of greenhouse gas emissions than organic carbon quality in the substrate. Since sulfate reducers outcompete methanogens, we hypothesized that the S-polluted site VJJ should have lower methane emissions than CB. In fact, the opposite was true, with significantly (p < 0.01) higher methane emissions from VJJ. Additionally, as a first step in an effort to link C isotope composition of emitted gases and residual peat substrate, we determined whether multiple vertical delta C-13 profiles in peat agree. A high degree of within-site homogeneity in delta C-13 was found. When a specific vertical delta C-13 trend was seen in one peat core, the same trend was also seen in all the remaining peat cores from the wetland. The delta C-13 value increased downcore at both CB and VJJ. At VJJ, however, 20 cm below surface, a reversal to lower delta C-13 downcore was seen. Based on Pb-210 dating, peat at 20-cm depth at VJJ was only 15 years old. Increasing delta C-13 values in VJJ peat accumulated between 1880-1990 could not be caused by assimilation of atmospheric CO2 gradually enriched in the light isotope C-12 due to fossil fuel burning. Rather they were a result of a combination of isotope fractionations accompanying assimilation and mineralization of Sphagnum C. These isotope fractionations may record information about past changes in C storage in wetlands.

AB Recent developments in technology and soil science have drawn particular attention to peatlands and their behaviour, properties and utilisation. Further, characteristics of peat are very important in evaluating it as a plant growth medium. The objective of this study was to characterise a number of samples collected from different depths of five different profiles of Yenicaga peat (carex) by measuring the organic carbon, total nitrogen, and extinction values (Er) of their humic acid fractions (HAs) in comparison with decomposition degrees. Peat samples having a high decomposition degree were near to the Er45 axis in the ordinate and had high Er67 values, whereas peats with low decomposition degree were far from the Er45 axis and had low Er67 values.

AB This study was initiated to analyze the effect of increased snow cover on plant photosynthesis in subarctic mires underlain by permafrost. Snow fences were used to increase the accumulation of snow on a subarctic permafrost mire in northern Sweden. By measuring reflected photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) the effect of snow thickness and associated delay of the start of the growing season was assessed in terms of absorbed PAR and estimated gross primary production (GPP). Six plots experienced increased snow accumulation and six plots were untreated. Incoming and reflected PAR was logged hourly from August 2010 to October 2013. In 2010 PAR measurements were coupled with flux chamber measurements to assess GPP and light use efficiency of the plots. The increased snow thickness prolonged the duration of the snow cover in spring. The delay of the growing season start in the treated plots was 18 days in 2011, 3 days in 2012 and 22 days in 2013. Results show higher PAR absorption, together with almost 35 % higher light use efficiency, in treated plots compared to untreated plots. Estimations of GPP suggest that the loss in early season photosynthesis, due to the shortening of the growing season in the treatment plots, is well compensated for by the increased absorption of PAR and higher light use efficiency throughout the whole growing seasons. This compensation is likely to be explained by increased soil moisture and nutrients together with a shift in vegetation composition associated with the accelerated permafrost thaw in the treatment plots.

AB Humification of Sphagnum occurs in peat bogs and locks up carbon as peat. Useful indicators and methods of humification can reflect the process of peat formation to some extent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV/Vis spectra and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra coupled with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis were applied to characterize the humification of Sphagnum, peat, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and chlorophyll with depth. The TEM results showed that chlorophyllous cells were almost completely degraded under the brown layer (EL), while Sphagnum hyaline cells demonstrated little degradation, and their structure could be observed even in peat. EEM spectra coupled with PARAFAC analysis is a good way to study chlorophyll in peat, and chlorophyll can be a useful indicator in humus studies. The peat had a relatively high chlorophyll content, which was negatively correlated with fulvic-like components and positively correlated with easily biodegradable organic matter. The parameters of samples from different layers fell into four groups, i.e., fulvic-like components, humification, humic-like components and/or protein-like components, easily biodegradable organic matter, and a combination or transition of the fluorescent substance of Sphagnum and humic-like components. The collapsed and defoliated layer (CDL) may be the layer in which the process of humification begins, and the humification of the grass root layer (GRL) was similar to that of peat. The degree of humification gradually increased from peat at 0-5 cm (P0-5) to peat at 10-15 cm (P10-15) and had no regular trend with depth from peat at 15-20 cm (P15-20) to peat at 25-30 cm (P25-30).

AB [1] Carbon uptake/release in peat soils ( the latter especially in the form of methane) is strongly dependent on soil temperature. However, previous peatland temperature models have not represented soil temperatures accurately due to either errors in their parameterization or errors in the representation of heat transfer processes. Dual probe heat pulse sensors (DPHPS) and triple-probe heat pulse sensors (TPHPS) were used to provide detailed in situ measurements of the soil thermal properties of Sphagnum peat and the advective liquid heat flux resulting from percolating rainfall. The difficulties of applying the DPHPS approach within poorly decomposed Sphagnum peat are first considered. Our results suggest that measurement- induced advective vapor and liquid heat fluxes occurred when using the DPHPS. The analytical equations normally used to calculate the thermal diffusivity and volumetric heat capacity ( C) from DPHPS measurements, therefore, cannot be applied within unsaturated Sphagnum peat. However, a numerical approach enabled the soil thermal properties to be estimated when an instrument-induced advective vapor flux was significant. When an instrument-induced advective liquid heat flux was significant, the relevant DPHPS data were identified and rejected. The measurements of the soil thermal properties were used to ( 1) develop an empirical model of the vertical variations in C through the unsaturated zone of poorly decomposed Sphagnum peat and ( 2) to develop an empirical relationship between the thermal conductivity (k) and C. The TPHPS measurements showed that the advective heat flux due to percolating rainfall occurred for a maximum of 24 hours after rainfall events. Its influence on soil temperatures may therefore be negligible.

AB Understanding the controls on soil respiration (SR) and litter decomposition (LD) rates within saline boreal fens can help in the development of wetland reclamation approaches in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR), where post-mined landscapes are commonly salt-affected. This study assesses the rates of SR and LD within a saline boreal fen near Fort McMurray (Alberta, Canada) and their relationship with electrical conductivity (EC), water table depth (WTD), soil moisture (SM) and temperature (ST), and nutrient availability. SR was assessed using community-scale CO2 measurements, and LD was estimated using the litter bag technique along a salinity gradient (EC 2-55 mS cm(-1)). Significant differences in SR between slightly saline, moderately saline, strongly saline, and very strongly saline sites were observed, and ridge sites had significantly higher SR than depressions. SR was strongly positively correlated to ST and strongly negatively correlated to WTD (i.e., shallower water table - lower SR and LD) and SM within both ridges and depressions. Ridges had significantly higher mean LD rates than depressions, and significant differences in LD rates along a salinity gradient were found. Our data suggest that although SR and LD are lower under very strongly saline conditions (EC > 16 mS cm(-1)), they are mainly driven by WTD and SM. This study reveals the importance of maintaining high and stable water table to decrease decomposition and promote accumulation of organic matter. These attributes could be targeted for constructed peatlands, which are currently being tested in the AOSR.

AB Fen plant growth in peat contaminated with groundwater discharges of oil sands process water (OSPW) was assessed in a greenhouse over two growing seasons. Three treatments (non-diluted OSPW, diluted OSPW and rainwater) were tested on five vascular plants and four mosses. All vascular plants tested can grow in salinity and naphthenic acids levels currently produced by oil sands activity in northwestern Canada. No stress sign was observed after both seasons. Because of plant characteristics. Carex species (C atherodes and C. utriculata) and Triglochin maritima would be more useful for rapidly restoring vegetation and creating a new peat-accumulating system. Groundwater discharge of OSPW proved detrimental to mosses under dry conditions and ensuring adequate water levels would be crucial in fen creation following oil sands exploitation. Campylium stellatum would be the best choice to grow in contaminated areas and Bryum pseudotriquetrum might be interesting as it has spontaneously regenerated in all treatments.

AB The concentrations of major and trace elements in the organic layer of peat soils across a 1800-km latitude profile of western Siberia were measured within various dominating ecosystems to evaluate the effect of landscape, latitude position and permafrost coverage on the peat chemical composition. In this study, peat core samples were collected every 10 cm along the entire length of the column, down to 3-4 m until the mineral horizon was reached. The peat samples were analyzed for major and trace elements using an ICP-MS technique following full acid digestion in a microwave oven. Depending on their concentration pattern along the peat column, several groups of elements were distinguished according to their general physico-chemical properties, mobility in soils, affinity to organic matter and plant biomass. Within similar ecosystems across various climate zones, there was a relatively weak variation in the TE concentration in the upper organic layer (green and brown parts of sphagnum mosses) with the latitude position. Within the intrinsic variability of the TE concentration over the peat column, the effects of climate, latitude position, and landscape location were not significantly pronounced. In different landscapes of the middle taiga, the peat columns collected in the fen zone, the low and mature forest, the ridge and the hollow did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in most major and trace element concentrations over the full depth of the peat column. In live (green) parts and dead (brown) parts of sphagnum mosses from this climate zone, the concentrations of Mn, P, Ca and Cu decreased significantly with increasing moss net primary production (NPP) at various habitats, whereas the other elements exhibited no link with the NPP trends. The Al- and mineral horizon-normalized peat concentration profiles, allowing removal of the occasional contamination by the underlying mineral substrate and atmospheric dust, demonstrated a homogeneous distribution of TEs along the peat column among various climate zones in the non-permafrost regions but significantly non-conservative behavior in the discontinuous permafrost site. The peat deposits in the northern part of western Siberia potentially have very high release of metals to the surface waters and the riverine systems, depending on the persistence of the ongoing permafrost thaw and the increase in the thickness of the active layer.

AB Plant microfossil and macrofossil associations obtained from six dated sections from the area of the basin of Bogota (2550 m, Eastern Cordillera, Colombia) show the evolution of the late Neogene Andean montane forest, triggered by the Andean orogeny. Progressive adaptation of warm tropical taxa to cool montane conditions, evolution of new nootropical montane taxa, and immigration of temperate Laurasian, Holarclic, and Austral-Antarctic elements gave shape to the present-day montane forest. Vegetational characteristics inferred from fossil plant associations reveal the altitude at the time of deposition. Neogene forests are floristically compared with contemporary forests at comparable altitudinal intervals in the surroundings of the Bogota basin; however, the absence of taxa that had not yet arrived, or evolved, is most salient and shows that non-analogue plant communities are common.
   The main phases of montane forest development are: (1) pre-uplift phase of the late Miocene with abundant lowland taxa with tropical or neotropical affinities (Mauritia Kunth, Amanoa Aubl., Ceiba Miller, and representatives of Humiriaceac); montane forest rich in Podocarpaceae (potentially including Nageia Gaertn., Podocarpus L'Her., Prumnopitys Phil., and Retrophyllum C. N. Page) covered other previously uplifted areas in the region; (2) toward the early Pliocene the area was uplifted to ca. 1000 m; the relative proportion of temperate taxa of North American and southern South American stock increased and occupied the slopes of the low mountains; and (3) by the middle Pliocene uplift had proceeded to ca. 2000-2200 m and tropical lowland taxa, which are now restricted to attitudes below 1000 m, are no longer recorded in the fossil plant associations; the increase in the number of newly appearing montane taxa (Myrica L., Turpinia Vent., Gunnera L., Bacconia L., Gaiadendron G. Don f., Dophnopsis C. Martins, and Monnina Ruiz & Pav.) suggests a significant increase of diversity.
   Until the late Pliocene there is little to no evidence for the existence of the paramo; taxa such as Xyris L., Hypericum L., Carex L., Montia L., and Ranunculus L. might have formed swamp or bog vegetation only. It is believed that these taxa colonized mountaintops with half-open vegetation; these areas extended when the mountains reached above upper forest line elevations.
   The distribution areas of the endemic genera of the Espeletiinae largely coincide with the youngest parts (< 5 Ma) of the northern Andes. Changing climatic conditions forced individual plant species to migrate vertically. Composition of plant communities changed continuously and vegetation belts frequently were altitudinally squeezed or offered possibilities for expansion. This long process stimulated speciation and provoked sequential non-analogue vegetation types. Thus, the biodiversity hotspot of the northern Andes has a dynamic history.

AB We summarise the work of an interdisciplinary network set up to explore the impacts of climate change in the British Uplands. In this CR Special, the contributors present the state of knowledge and this introduction synthesises this knowledge and derives implications for decision makers. The Uplands are valued semi-natural habitats, providing ecosystem services that have historically been taken for granted. For example, peat soils, which are mostly found in the Uplands, contain around 50% of the terrestrial carbon in the UK. Land management continues to be a driver of ecosystem service delivery. Degraded and managed peatlands are subject to erosion and carbon loss with negative impacts on biodiversity, carbon storage and water quality. Climate change is already being experienced in British Uplands and is likely to exacerbate these pressures. Climate envelope models suggest as much as 50% of British Uplands and peatlands will be exposed to climate stress by the end of the 21st century under low and high emissions scenarios. However, process-based models of the response of organic soils to this climate stress do not give a consistent indication of what this will mean for soil carbon: results range from a very slight increase in uptake, through a clear decline, to a net carbon loss. Preserving existing peat stocks is an important climate mitigation strategy, even if new peat stops forming. Preserving upland vegetation cover is a key win-win management strategy that will reduce erosion and loss of soil carbon, and protect a variety of services such as the continued delivery of a high quality water resource.

AB In this comment we argue that the premise on which the peat mound model developed by Armstrong (Earth Surface Process and Landforms, 1995, 20, 473-477) is based, that hydraulic conductivity shows an exponential decline with depth in bog peats, is unsound. Empirical evidence in the literature for such an exponential decline is less sound than Armstrong suggests. In addition, Armstrong's suggestion that the hypothesis of Baird and Gaffney (Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 1995, 20, 561-566) supports an exponential decline is shown to be erroneous.

AB 1. Drainage of peat-dominated catchments across the world has caused widespread degradation of peat and freshwater ecosystem services. In the UK, an estimated 500 pound million has been spent over the last decade blocking drains to reverse these changes. The practice raises water-tables to induce rewetting and promote peat aggradation. However, the potential benefits for impacted ecosystems such as streams remain unknown.
   2. This study examined stream physicochemistry and benthic macroinvertebrates across peatland catchments with artificial drainage networks, or drains that have recently been blocked, and compared these with intact peatland sites having no history of drainage.
   3. Streams in artificially drained catchments were characterised by more benthic fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), higher suspended sediment concentrations and finer bed sediments (D50) than in drain-blocked and intact catchments.
   4. Drained sites had higher abundance of Diptera (Simuliidae and Chironomidae) larvae, and lower abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera larvae, than drain-blocked sites. In contrast, streams in drain-blocked catchments had macroinvertebrate communities broadly similar to intact sites in terms of taxon richness, overall species composition and community structure. These changes were associated with lower suspended sediment and benthic FPOM concentrations following drain-blocking.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study has shown changes in the structure of stream benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages linked to increases in benthic particulate organic matter and suspended sediment following peatland drainage. However, these effects seem to be reversible following catchment- scale restoration by drain-blocking. Drain-blocking therefore appears to benefit not only peatland soil, vegetation and hydrological ecosystem services but also stream water quality and biodiversity. The numerous agencies undertaking peatland restoration should consider implementing detailed pre-and post-blocking monitoring of streams to further improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which peatland management affects stream biodiversity and biological recovery dynamics, refine drain-blocking practices, and inform aquatic conservation and management strategies.

AB Northern peatlands and permafrost soils are associated with large carbon stocks. Rising temperatures are likely to affect the carbon balance in high-latitude ecosystems, but to what degree is uncertain. We have enhanced the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model by introducing processes necessary to simulate permafrost dynamics, peatland hydrology, and peatland vegetation. The new version, LPJ-WHy v1.2, was used to study soil temperature, active layer depth, permafrost distribution, and water table position. Modeled soil temperatures agreed well with observations, apart from a Siberian site where the soil is insulated by an extensive shrub layer. Water table positions were generally in the range of observations, with some exceptions. Simulated active layer depth showed a mean absolute error of 44 cm when compared to observations, but the error was reduced to 25 cm when the soil type for seven sites was manually corrected to mirror local conditions. A sensitivity test, in which temperature and precipitation were varied independently, showed that soil temperatures and active layer depths increased more under higher temperatures when precipitation was increased at the same time. The sensitivity experiment suggested persisting wet conditions in peatlands even under temperature increases of up to 9 degrees C as long as annual precipitation is allowed to increase with temperature to the extent indicated by climate model experiments.

AB An ombrotrophic peat core (10 x 10 x 81 cm) was collected from Etang de la Gruere (Switzerland) and divided in 27 slices of 3 cm. Humic acids (HAs) were extracted from each slice after freeze-drying and fine milling. All raw peat and HA samples were analyzed using Energy-dispersive miniprobe X-ray fluorescence multielement analyser (EMMA-XRF), fluorescence spectroscopy and Low Background gamma-spectrometry (LB gamma-spec). The abundance and distribution of major and trace elements and radionuclides were measured in raw peat and corresponding HAs to possibly evaluate their affinity for organic ligands and establish which organic fraction might affect their behaviour along the profile. Raw peat samples show higher concentrations of Fe, Mn, Pb, Sr, Ti and Ca in comparison to the corresponding HAs, while Cu is more abundant in HAs. Zinc presents greater concentrations in raw peat in the first 24 cm of depth. All elements, with the exception of Fe, seem to be bound stably to HAs, although at different extent. The activity of Am-241 is limited to the raw peat of a specific section of the profile, while that Of Cs-137 is recorded both in HAs and raw peat, even below the depth one would expect, suggesting the scarce mobility of the former and a different impact of these radionuclides on the environment.

AB Wetland soils play a key role for the transformation of heavy metals in forested watersheds, influencing their mobility, and ecotoxicity. Our goal was to investigate the mechanisms of release from solid to solution phase, the mobility, and the transformation of arsenic species in a fen soil. In methanol-water extracts, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, trimethylarsine oxide, arsenobetaine, and two unknown organic arsenic species were found with concentrations up to 14 ng As g(-1) at the surface horizon. Arsenate is the dominant species at the 0-30 cm depth, whereas arsenite predominated at the 30-70 cm depth. Only up to 2.2% of total arsenic in fen was extractable with methanol-water. In porewaters, depth gradient spatial variation of arsenic species, pH, redox potentials, and the other chemical parameters along the profile was observed in June together with high proportion of organic arsenic species (up to 1.2 mu g As L-1, 70% of total arsenic). Tetramethylarsonium ion and an unknown organic arsenic species were additionally detected in porewaters at deeper horizons. In comparison, the arsenic speciation in porewaters in April was homogeneous with depth and no organic arsenic species were found. Thus, the occurrence of microbial methylation of arsenic in fen was demonstrated for the first time. The 10 times elevated total arsenic concentrations in porewaters in June compared to April were accompanied by elevated concentrations of total iron, lower concentrations of sulfate and the presence of ammonium and phosphate. The low proportion of methanol-water extractable total arsenic suggests a generally low mobility of arsenic in fen soils. The release of arsenic from solid to solution phases in fen is dominantly controlled by dissolution of iron oxides, redox transformation, and methylation of arsenic, driven by microbial activity in the growing season. As a result, increased concentrations of total arsenic and potentially toxic arsenic species in fen porewaters were found in the growing season, suggesting an enhancing risk of arsenic transport of ground- and surface-waters under these conditions.

AB Prairie fens are globally vulnerable wetlands that are considered a conservation priority due to threats to their high biodiversity and hydrological functions. Establishing a thorough and repeatable plant sampling protocol is critical to evaluating conservation and management initiatives. Our goal was to evaluate a sample methodology designed to assess prairie fen plant diversity and determine if it produced results (1) representative of site diversity, (2) comparable among fens, and (3) efficient to collect. Nineteen fens between 8.5 and 28.4 ha were surveyed twice within one growing season during 2012 and 2013 field seasons using an area-proportional, random design. The turnover in species between spring and summer sampling periods within a site ranged from 8 to 50 %. Sample coverage of total estimated plant species richness ranged from 84.8 to 95.0 % with a mean of 90.1 %. We compared results from our area-proportional, random design to simulated random samples of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 quadrats per site. No significant difference was found in sample coverage per fen when using sampling rates of 25, 30, or 35 quadrats per site versus the area-proportional design. Shannon's diversity index and floristic quality index differed by sample period and number of quadrats sampled per fen. Our sample design produced acceptable levels of coverage and facilitated comparisons across fens. Our methodology could be applied to future research, restoration monitoring, and conservation planning efforts in Midwestern prairie fens.

AB Peatlands contain approximately one third of all soil organic carbon (SOC). Warming can alter above- and belowground linkages that regulate soil organic carbon dynamics and C-balance in peatlands. Here we examine the multiyear impact of in situ experimental warming on the microbial food web, vegetation, and their feedbacks with soil chemistry. We provide evidence of both positive and negative impacts of warming on specific microbial functional groups, leading to destabilization of the microbial food web. We observed a strong reduction (70%) in the biomass of top-predators (testate amoebae) in warmed plots. Such a loss caused a shortening of microbial food chains, which in turn stimulated microbial activity, leading to slight increases in levels of nutrients and labile C in water. We further show that warming altered the regulatory role of Sphagnum-polyphenols on microbial community structure with a potential inhibition of top predators. In addition, warming caused a decrease in Sphagnum cover and an increase in vascular plant cover. Using structural equation modelling, we show that changes in the microbial food web affected the relationships between plants, soil water chemistry, and microbial communities. These results suggest that warming will destabilize C and nutrient recycling of peatlands via changes in above- and belowground linkages, and therefore, the microbial food web associated with mosses will feedback positively to global warming by destabilizing the carbon cycle. This study confirms that microbial food webs thus constitute a key element in the functioning of peatland ecosystems. Their study can help understand how mosses, as ecosystem engineers, tightly regulate biogeochemical cycling and climate feedback in peatlands

AB Peat and forest floor samples (n = 307) from sites across continental western Canada are analyzed. to determine (a) Carbon/organic matter (C/OM) ratios for different peat and forest floor types, (b) variability in C/OM ratios, and (c) the influence of vegetation type and ash content on C/OM ratios. Measured C/OM ratios for different peat and forest floor types are between 0.50 and 0.56, with an average of 0.52 over all samples. C/OM ratios change with ash content, with a positive relationship between the two variables if ash content is < 20%. In samples with ash contents >20%, C/OM ratios are highly variable and our data suggest a slight decrease in average C/OM ratios with increased mineral content. Measurement error due to loss of structural water from clay minerals and the presence of inorganic C increasingly influence observed C/OM ratios as mineral content increases. While these problems can be partially overcome by use of appropriate analytical technique, LOI may not be a reliable measure of OM content in samples with very high mineral content.

AB The notion that plants are tightly coupled to their belowground environment so that decomposition occurs faster in their place of origin is now a widely tested hypothesis known as the home-field advantage (HFA). Microbial adaptation to the most prevalent plant litter is the hypothesis proposed to explain decomposition results in a number of HFA studies but fails to corroborate results of many others, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of decomposition dynamics at local scales. Boreal peatlands are important ecosystems for carbon storage that are expected to be significantly affected by climate change, thus understanding decomposition dynamics in Boreal peatland systems is of global relevance. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment using pure and mixed litters of two dominant peatland plant types (Sphagnum moss and Carex sedge) present in differing densities at two sites differing in nutrient status in a Boreal peatland complex. Aboveground (temperature, relative humidity) and belowground (pH, moisture, available nitrogen) environmental characteristics were measured, and initial litter quality (C, N, S) was assessed with decomposition (mass loss) quantified after one year. We use linked HFA equations that help account for differences in litter quality and site conditions. While Carex lost greater overall mass than Sphagnum, both Carex and Sphagnum demonstrate a HFA, but only where they were the dominant plant of each site. This result held for both pure and mixed litters, suggesting microbial specificity to the most prevalent plant type, yet mixed litters moderated the strength of the HFA. While our results provide novel insights to plant-soil linkages and mixed litter interactions in Boreal peatlands, mechanisms underpinning microbial specificity to plant litter in these ecosystems requires further investigation.

AB A brief review of the genesis of blanket peats is presented, together with detailed analyses of basal peats from northern Scotland. Particular attention is paid to local factors affecting peat growth and the problems of sampling and interpretation arising from them. Macrofossil and loss-on-ignition analyses of four peat mineral interfaces solve many of the terminological problems of such profiles and indicate that interpretations based on field stratigraphy alone are uncertain. Pollen analyses of two profiles from contrasting microtopographic situations show well-defined vegetational change associated with early peat development. Fully organic ombrotrophic peat is present from 6805 +/- 50 BP at one site, following anthropogenic burning from c. 7500 BP and partial recovery of the open birch woodland. A change from birch woodland to Calluna heath occurs at approximately the same time on a more freely drained site with much later peat development, following further burning from 4890 +/- 65 BP. Anthropogenic activity is clearly associated with changes in soil and vegetation preceding peat formation, and the role of climatic factors remains equivocal.

AB Recent research has shown that ombrotrophic mires can yield a proxy climate signal based on changes in the degree of peat humification [1,2], and that oceanic margin sites show the most sensitive record [3]. We compare humification records for the last 1000 yr from two radiocarbon-dated blanket peat profiles from western Ireland, and show several corresponding periods of climatic fluctuations. Periods favouring reduced peat decomposition, suggestive of wetter and/or cooler climatic conditions, seem to coincide with periods of reduced sunspot activity and atmospheric C-14 anomalies.
   Whilst climatologists have continued to debate a link between solar variability on a century timescale and climate change, the exact nature of that link remains elusive [4-7]. The results from Ireland demonstrate that data derived from mires could be relevant to the debate as to the extent of solar forcing in natural climatic variability, and the curves shown provide a continuous record to add to previous evidence for the so-called 'Medieval Optimum' and 'Little Ice Age' [8]. The record may imply that, during the past millennium, climatic change at the oceanic margin of the northeast Atlantic largely corresponded to inferred variations in solar output.

AB Eriophorum vaginatum is a characteristic species of northern peatlands and a keystone plant for cutover bog restoration. Understanding the factors affecting E. vaginatum seedling establishment (i.e. growth dynamics and allocation) under global change has practical implications for the management of abandoned mined bogs and restoration of their C-sequestration function. We studied the responses of leaf dynamics, above- and belowground biomass production of establishing seedlings to elevated CO2 and N. We hypothesised that nutrient factors such as limitation shifts or dilutions would modulate growth stimulation. Elevated CO2 did not affect biomass, but increased the number of young leaves in spring (+400 %), and the plant vitality (i.e. number of green leaves/total number of leaves) (+3 %), both of which were negatively correlated to [K+] in surface porewater, suggesting a K-limited production of young leaves. Nutrient ratios in green leaves indicated either N and K co-limitation or K limitation. N addition enhanced the number of tillers (+38 %), green leaves (+18 %), aboveground and belowground biomass (+99, +61 %), leaf mass-to-length ratio (+28 %), and reduced the leaf turnover (-32 %). N addition enhanced N availability and decreased [K+] in spring surface porewater. Increased tiller and leaf production in July were associated with a doubling in [K+] in surface porewater suggesting that under enhanced N production is K driven. Both experiments illustrate the importance of tradeoffs in E. vaginatum growth between: (1) producing tillers and generating new leaves, (2) maintaining adult leaves and initiating new ones, and (3) investing in basal parts (corms) for storage or in root growth for greater K uptake. The K concentration in surface porewater is thus the single most important factor controlling the growth of E. vaginatum seedlings in the regeneration of selected cutover bogs.

AB Chrysophyte stomatocyst assemblages were described, using International Statospore Working Group (ISWG) guidelines, from a peat core from the Lena River Region of northwestern Siberia (69 degrees 23.33 N, 125 degrees 08.37 E). Cysts were well preserved, abundant, and diverse throughout the 7180 +/- 110 years of peat accumulation. A total of 161 morphotypes were recorded, of which 52 are described as new. As this is only the second study of chrysophyte cysts from arctic peats, this high number of new morphotypes is not overly surprising. Marked changes in cyst assemblages occurred throughout the development of this bog, indicating that chrysophyte cysts preserved in peats may potentially provide important paleoenvironmental proxy data.

AB Antimony (Sb) is a common contaminant in natural peatlands used as treatment wetlands for water influenced by metal mining in cold-climate regions. However, while other metalloids such as arsenic have been well studied, little is known about removal and retention of Sb in northern wetlands under challenging environmental conditions. In this study we assessed short-term, long-term and seasonal variations in mobility, removal, and retention of Sb from mining-influenced water in two peat based natural wetlands with different loading and physical conditions. Analyses based on 10 years of water quality data and data on contaminant accumulation in the peat soil revealed that the wetland with significantly lower hydraulic load and Sb areal load achieved adequate Sb removal, but with a slight decline in recent years. Antimony concentrations at the wetland outlet were slightly lower in summers than in winters. Dilution due to high rainfall during summer may be the likely reason for low outlet concentrations towards the end of summer. Outlet Sb concentrations were on the rise after inlet water quality was significantly improved through enhanced pre-treatment indicating mobilization of accumulated Sb. In comparison, the smaller wetland with higher hydraulic and Sb loading had very low Sb removal and a stronger decrease in Sb concentration through dilution due to snowmelt. The results highlight the challenges in Sb retention which should get more attention when treatment wetlands are designed for Sb rich waters such as mine waters and there are changes in water treatment arrangement in specific cases.

AB Soil respiration is a very important factor influencing carbon deposition in peat and reflecting the intensity of soil organic matter decomposition, root respiration, and the ease of transporting gases to the surface. Carbon dioxide release from three different peat soil profiles (0-80 cm) of the Polesie Lubelskie Region (Eastern Poland) was analyzed under laboratory conditions. Peat samples were incubated at 5, 10, and 20 degrees C in aerobic and anaerobic environments, and their CO2-evolution was analyzed up to 14 days. The respiration activity was found to be in the range of 0.013-0.497 g CO2 kg(-1) DW d(-1). The respiratory quotient was estimated to be in the range of 0.51-1.51, and the difference in respiration rates over 10 degrees C ranged between 4.15 and 8.72 in aerobic and from 1.15 to 6.53 in anaerobic conditions. A strong influence of temperature, depth, the degree of peat decomposition, pH, and nitrate content on respiration activity was found. Lack of oxygen at low temperature caused higher respiration activity than under aerobic conditions. These results should be taken into account when the management of Polish peatlands is considered in the context of climate and carbon storage, and physicochemical properties of soil in relation to soil respiration activity are considered.

AB 1. Boreal ecosystems are warming roughly twice as fast as the global average, resulting in woody expansion that could further speed up the climate warming. Boreal peatbogs are waterlogged systems that store more than 30% of the global soil carbon. Facilitative effects of shrubs and trees on the establishment of new individuals could increase tree cover with profound consequences for the structure and functioning of boreal peatbogs, carbon sequestration and climate.
   2. We conducted two field experiments in boreal peatbogs to assess the mechanisms that explain tree seedling recruitment and to estimate the strength of positive feedbacks between shrubs and trees. We planted seeds and seedlings of Pinus sylvestris in microsites with contrasting water-tables and woody cover and manipulated both shrub canopy and root competition. We monitored seedling emergence, growth and survival for up to four growing seasons and assessed how seedling responses related to abiotic and biotic conditions.
   3. We found that tree recruitment is more successful in drier topographical microsites with deeper water-tables. On these hummocks, shrubs have both positive and negative effects on tree seedling establishment. Shrub cover improved tree seedling condition, growth and survival during the warmest growing season. In turn, higher tree basal area correlates positively with soil nutrient availability, shrub biomass and abundance of tree juveniles.
   4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that shrubs facilitate tree colonization of peatbogs which further increases shrub growth. These facilitative effects seem to be stronger under warmer conditions suggesting that a higher frequency of warmer and dry summers may lead to stronger positive interactions between shrubs and trees that could eventually facilitate a shift from moss to tree-dominated systems.

AB O-3 concentrations in the troposphere are rising and those in the stratosphere decreasing, the latter resulting in higher fluxes of solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation to the earth's surface. We assessed whether the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are altered by enhanced UV-B radiation or elevated tropospheric O-3 concentrations in boreal peatland microcosms (core depth 40 cm, diameter 10.5 cm) with different vegetation cover. At the end of the UV-B experiment which lasted for a growing season, net CO2 exchange (NEE) and dark ecosystem respiration (R (TOT)) were sevenfold higher, and CH4 efflux 12-fold higher, in microcosms with intact vegetation dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum L. and Sphagnum spp., compared to microcosms from which we removed E. vaginatum. Vegetation treatment had minor effects on CH4 production and consumption potentials in the peat, suggesting that the large difference in CH4 efflux is mainly due to efficient CH4 transport via the aerenchyma of E. vaginatum. Ambient UV-B supplemented with 30% and elevated O-3 concentrations (100 and 200 ppb, for 7 weeks) significantly increased R-TOT in both vegetation treatments. Elevated O-3 concentrations reduced NEE over time, while UV-B had no clear effects on the fluxes of CO2 or CH4 in the cloudy summer of the study. Field experiments are needed to assess the significance of increasing UV-B radiation and elevated tropospheric O-3 concentration on peatland gas exchange in the long-term.

AB Peat-forming wetlands, particularly floating fens that form the initial stages of these ecosystems, are declining globally due to excavation, dehydration and eutrophication. Restoration typically involves reestablishment of early-successional open-water stages, with oligotrophic conditions that are characteristic for these systems. However, restoration success is notoriously limited. A potential improvement may be to initiate succession by reintroducing of target plant species. Knowledge is therefore needed on (a) which plant functional groups should be re-introduced to stimulate fen formation; and (b) how to manage nutrient levels during restoration, considering that plant growth may be slow in oligotrophic conditions. We hypothesized that increasing functional diversity of introduced species would stimulate the formation of peat-forming target communities, their biomass accumulation and expansion onto open water. We also hypothesized that nutrient availability would mediate the relative contribution of specific functional groups to these effects. We investigated this in 36 artificial outdoor ponds by manipulating plant functional diversity (clonal dominants, clonal stress-tolerators and interstitials) on constructed rafts with fen-forming communities, and subjected these to a range of nutrient loadings over 2 years. Increasing functional diversity as well as increasing nutrient loadings had stimulating effects on plant biomass accumulation, cover formation and rhizome growth onto open water. Both complementarity (due to niche partitioning or facilitation) and selection effects were mechanisms underlying the diversity effect, with a constant relative importance over the entire range of nutrient availabilities. Different functional groups were important for biomass production at different nutrient availabilities. Rhizome formation by clonal stress-tolerators contributed disproportionately to open water colonization, identifying this functional group as key across all nutrient levels. Synthesis and applications. Restoration of floating fen communities can be stimulated during the first 2 years by introducing a high functional diversity of plant species. These include fast-growing clonal species, clonal stress-tolerators and interstitials, which facilitate each other. Restoration is dependent on the presence of clonal stress-tolerators such as Calla palustris, Comarum palustre and Menyanthes trifoliata for expansion onto the open water. Furthermore, restoration can start under a wide range of water nutrient levels, including eutrophic conditions.

AB Peat is burned during malt kilning to provide flavor compounds in Scotch malt whisky. The aim of this work was to establish whether peats from different locations in Scotland are chemically distinct and could impart different flavors. Peat samples from four locations (Islay, Orkney, St. Fergus, and Tomintoul) were analyzed using Curie point pyrolysis in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). Peat pyrolysates from Islay and St. Fergus were rich in lignin derivatives, while those from Orkney and Tomintoul had higher levels of carbohydrate derivatives. Also, Islay and Orkney peat pyrolysates were rich in nitrogen-containing compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons, respectively. The depth of peat extraction was found to have an additional effect on peat composition as the levels of carbohydrate derivatives reduced With increasing depth. Where peat is used in whisky production, the observed differences in peat composition could potentially impact flavor, an important consideration if the peat used for malt production is changed by either choice or necessity.

AB This study compares age estimates of recent peat deposits in 10 European ombrotrophic (precipitation-fed) bogs produced using the C-14 bomb peak, Pb-210, Cs-137, spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs), and pollen. At 3 sites, the results of the different dating methods agree well. In 5 cores, there is a clear discrepancy between the C-14 bomb peak and Pb-210 age estimates. In the upper layers of the profiles, the age estimates of C-14 and Pb-210 are in agreement. However, with increasing depth, the difference between the age estimates appears to become progressively greater. The evidence from the sites featured in the study suggests that, provided aboveground plant material (seeds, leaves) is selected for dating, the C-14 bomb peak is a reliable dating method, and is not significantly affected by the incorporation of old carbon with low C-14 content originating from sources including air pollution deposition or methane produced by peat decomposition. Pb-210 age estimates that are too old may be explained by the enrichment of Pb-210 activity in the surface layers of peat resulting from a hypothesized mechanism where rapidly infilling hollows, rich in binding sites, may scavenge Pb-210 associated with dissolved organic matter passing through the hollow, as part of the surface drainage network. Until further research identifies and resolves the cause of the inaccuracy in Pb-210 dating, age estimates of peat samples based only on Pb-210 should be used with caution.

AB The relationship between changes of peat bog hydrology and the mechanisms of decomposition suggests that the chemical modification of biopolymers of peat macrofossils might be used in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. A series of sedge (Eriophorum vaginatum) macrofossils from an Upper Holocene peat profile has been studied by analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS). The major diagenetic changes of biopolymers included loss of ester-bound ferulic and coumaric acids, an increase of oxidation (particularly due to C alpha ketones) and shortening of alkyl side-chains, demethylation of methoxy groups of the lignin/polyphenol fraction, loss of pentosan polysaccharides and modification of cellulose (relative increase in the pyrolytic yield of anhydroglucose). The yield of oxidized methoxy moieties (particularly of C alpha ketones) and shortening of alkyl side-chains of methoxyphenols were suggested as the best indicators of oxidative degradation. Statistically significant differences in chemical composition between samples from individual depth increments occur, in part in agreement with a sequence of wet and dry phases determined by paleobotanical analysis. The paleoenvironmental significance of the chemical record of degradation and relationship of paleohydrology reconstructed by the present technique and by means of botanical analysis is discussed. The former was proposed to respond primarily to the frequency of seasonal droughts. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Herbivores are key drivers of vegetation dynamics in most ecosystems. However, the effect of high arctic herbivores on vegetation dynamics throughout a growing season is not well understood. In this study, we examine the impacts of a large dominant herbivore in the tundra ecosystem, the muskox, Ovibos moschatus, using exclosures established in a fen in high Arctic Greenland. Using weekly sampling throughout the growing season, we quantified the effects of muskox exclusion on aboveground plant biomass and on concentrations and pools of carbon and nitrogen, and explored the timing of peak biomass and nutrient pools. Excluding muskoxen profoundly changed plant abundances and dynamics of the fen, with more than a doubling of aboveground plant biomass and carbon and nitrogen pool sizes. Specifically, large increases in mosses and litter were observed, while graminoid biomass did not change significantly with exclusion of muskoxen. Excluding muskoxen advanced the peak of plant biomass, but also led to a more rapid decline, resulting in an earlier and shorter period of maximal plant biomass inside the exclosures. The largest impact of muskoxen on the arctic fen ecosystem seems to be through their trampling effects on the moss layer, which likely mediated most of the observed changes. This study demonstrates how quickly an ecosystem may respond to changes in the abundance of large herbivores and highlights their pivotal role in modifying vegetation dynamics and nutrient cycling in tundra ecosystems.

AB The organic matter accumulation potential of a restored bog was estimated over 2 years as a balance between losses to decomposition and inputs through above-ground net primary productivity (AGNPP) in five micro-habitats of increasing complexity (relating to the moss carpet thickness and the number of vegetation functional groups). Decomposition and accumulation rates variations were hypothesized to lead to higher organic matter accumulation potential in the more complex micro-habitats. In general, for a given litter type, the mass losses and decomposition rates were rather homogeneous between micro-habitats, but, they were correlated to the cover of particular species: Eriophorum vaginatum with slower decomposition rates, and Ledum groendlandicum or Kalmia angustifolia with higher rates. Therefore, the abundance of some peatland species, rather than the habitat complexity itself, was a driver of decomposition rates. While the Sphagnum AGNPP did not compensate for decomposition losses, the organic matter accumulation potential was tipped towards a sink (positive) by the contribution of vascular species to the AGNPP. The organic matter accumulation potentials are much improved by the presence of Sphagnum, but from a restoration perspective, promoting the growth of vascular peatland species might also be a key to achieving a positive balance of organic matter accumulation.

AB Peat forming Sphagnum mosses are able to prevent the dominance of vascular plants under ombrotrophic conditions by efficiently scavenging atmospherically deposited nitrogen (N). N-uptake kinetics of these mosses are therefore expected to play a key role in differential N availability, plant competition, and carbon sequestration in Sphagnum peatlands. The interacting effects of rain N concentration and exposure time on moss N-uptake rates are, however, poorly understood. We investigated the effects of N-concentration (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 mu M), N-form (N-15 - ammonium or nitrate) and exposure time (0.5, 2, 72 h) on uptake kinetics for Sphagnum magellanicum from a pristine bog in Patagonia (Argentina) and from a Dutch bog exposed to decades of N-pollution. Uptake rates for ammonium were higher than for nitrate, and N-binding at adsorption sites was negligible. During the first 0.5 h, N-uptake followed saturation kinetics revealing a high affinity (K-m 3.5-6.5 mu M). Ammonium was taken up 8 times faster than nitrate, whereas over 72 hours this was only 2 times. Uptake rates decreased drastically with increasing exposure times, which implies that many short-term N-uptake experiments in literature may well have overestimated long-term uptake rates and ecosystem retention. Sphagnum from the polluted site (i.e. long-term N exposure) showed lower uptake rates than mosses from the pristine site, indicating an adaptive response. Sphagnum therefore appears to be highly efficient in using short N pulses (e. g. rainfall in pristine areas). This strategy has important ecological and evolutionary implications: at high N input rates, the risk of N-toxicity seems to be reduced by lower uptake rates of Sphagnum, at the expense of its long-term filter capacity and related competitive advantage over vascular plants. As shown by our conceptual model, interacting effects of N-deposition and climate change (changes in rainfall) will seriously alter the functioning of Sphagnum peatlands.

AB A series of structural features of the three main humic fractions (humic acid, fulvic acid and humin) from different depths of a peat bog deposit in Mazagon (Huelva, Southern Spain) were isolated and analysed by flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, solid-state C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy. Such techniques demonstrate that the various humic fractions were very different not only in terms of molecular weight but also in their composition and structural characteristics, showing well differentiated patterns in the relative distribution of alkyl, O-alkyl and aromatic moieties in each humic fraction. To a large extent, selectively preserved lignin accumulates in the humic acid (HA) fraction, whereas the fulvic acid (FA) consists of a colloidal carbohydrate with a substantial peptidic moiety and the humin includes the noteworthy concentration of insoluble, macromolecular polyalkyl structures. A diagnostic lignin signature in the resolution-enhanced infrared spectra of the HA points to processes of selective preservation of macromolecular substances derived from vascular plants. In general, the humic fractions were not extensive sources of chemotaxonomic descriptors of previously documented biodiversity changes along the period of the peat deposit formation. This is in harmony with a substantial homogenising effect of diagenetic transformations throughout the whole sedimentary record with peat stratigraphy recording mostly the authigenic processes of bog formation and development. Anthropogenic perturbations may be also responsible for the loss of information in the humic proxy resulting in the lack of an apparent relationship between any particular input and the composition of the humic fractions from the peat bog.

AB Short-term field experiments are often used to predict and evaluate long-term management effects. Based on a mowing experiment in two calcareous fens near Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland, we investigated whether shea-term treatment effects (i.e. during the first four years) were confirmed by longterm results (13 - 14 yr). Plots were mown in summer or in winter or left unmown. The main long-term trends in overall species composition (based on percentage cover estimates) were already observable in the first four years: mown and unmown plots diverged, whereas summer-cut and winter-cut plots remained similar. At the individual species level, however, short-term and long-term treatment effects differed considerably: many species whose abundance seemed affected by treatments during the first four years showed no response in the long term, and vice versa. These discrepancies were similar when based on cover estimates or on counts of shoots. Species responses did actually depend on the time scale considered. Short-term and long-term treatment effects on species richness were similar (i.e. a decrease in unmown plots), although only long-term effects were significant. Treatment effects on the above-ground biomass varied considerably, and short-term trends (lower biomass in unmown plots) differed from long-term trends (higher biomass in unmown plots). Our sites showed little overall change in species composition during the period investigated, and treatment effects were low compared with other similar experiments. if study sites are less stable or treatment effects more drastic, a short-term evaluation is expected to be even less reliable. Knowledge on species dynamics at a site may help to choose the adequate spatial and temporal scale of investigation, and thus increase the efficiency of management experiments.

AB For the first time, an isolated cushion-plant peat hillock was investigated, a so far neglected feature of high-Andean spring ecosystems. These small hillocks typically cluster around springs within the upper catchment areas of larger cushion-plant peatlands at altitudes ranging from 4000 m to 5000 m a.s.l.
   The size of the investigated peat hillock, located within the Rio Viscas catchment area (Lucanas province, District of Ayacucho) at 4250 m a.s.l., is relatively small (about 10 m in diameter). Due to its dome-shaped and densely green habitus, it overlooks the surrounding vegetation by about 1-2m and stands out by its color. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) techniques are used in order to provide insights into the spatial extension of the Distichia muscoides-dominated vegetation stand.
   For the reconstruction of environmental dynamics during the past millennium, plant micro-/macrofossil analyses and total carbon/total nitrogen measurements were applied. Based on radiocarbon dating, the peat archive provides a chronology for the past 1050 years. We interpret phases of relatively high abundances of Poaceae pollen in our record as an expansion of Andean grasslands during humid phases. Drier conditions are indicated by a decrease of Poaceae pollen and higher abundances of Asteraceae pollen. The results reflect significant climate oscillations and provide evidence for a sustained dry phase between AD 900 and AD 1100. A more humid and cooler phase prevailed from around AD 1300 to AD 1825, during the Little Ice Age.
   Our data provide evidence that such a spatially defined peat-accumulating ecosystem, as represented by the studied peat hillock, is capable to survive pronounced climatic oscillations as long as it does not lose its protective cushion-plant surface. As peat hillocks are heavily affected by grazing, multitemporal studies should be carried out to document changes and to provide new insights into adaption strategies of vegetation to changing environmental conditions.

AB Headwater stream ecosystems draining blanket peat-dominated catchments occur in many high-latitude river systems. These systems are thought to be very sensitive to threats from climate change, and land-use modification including artificial drainage, overgrazing, afforestation and vegetation burning. This study examined ten peatland streams in the headwaters of the River Tees to examine spatial and seasonal patterns of instream physicochemical variables and benthic macroinvertebrate communities across the stream network. Principle component analysis revealed significant positive relationships between catchment size and electrical conductivity, sulfate concentration, pH and median bed sediment size, and negative relationships with suspended sediment and aluminium concentrations. Seasonal variability was particularly evident in stream water temperature, benthic particulate organic matter and nitrate and chloride concentrations. Macroinvertebrate community abundance and diversity were typically similar across streams, but redundancy analysis demonstrated turnover of macroinvertebrate assemblages with increases in stream size. In particular, first-and second-order streams hosted small-sized stoneflies such as Amphinemura standfussi and Nemoura cambrica, while larger streams (third-and fourth-order) supported more mayflies and larger predatory stoneflies (e. g. Dinocras cephalotes and Perla bipunctata). Many environmental drivers of ecological patterns appear to work in synergy in peatland headwater streams, and controlled experiments may be necessary to disentangle some of the variables to guide effective conservation and management strategies in impacted peatland river systems.

TI Restoration approach influences carbon exchange at in-situ oil sands

DE Peatland restoration; Mounding; Carbon dioxide; Methane; Greenhouse gas
   emissions; Oil sands exploration disturbance
AB Oil sands exploration activities across the Alberta boreal peatlands requires tree clearing and results in sites being left compressed and with altered understory vegetation. Restoration techniques, including planting trees, mechanical mounding with tree planting, and spreading coarse woody debris have been tested across abandoned oil sands exploration sites. In this study two oil sands exploration sites were monitored 6- and 9-years post-treatment, along with two control areas disturbed 20 years ago with no active restoration treatment. Results were compared to a natural reference site to understand how various restoration techniques influenced carbon flux and growing season carbon balance. Tree ingress was observed across all parts of the restored oil sands exploration sites except a wet control area disturbed 20 years ago. The creation of dry microsites through the mechanical mounding technique substantially increased tree productivity, and we found that 9 years post-restoration the mounded area of an oil sands exploration site had a tree net primary productivity similar to the natural site. This carbon uptake, however, was partially offset by large emissions of methane from pools adjacent to mounds. We found that planting trees only could result in a growing season carbon balance that is within the range of a natural peatland 9 years following restoration. However, our estimates indicate that the mounding treatment 9 years following restoration released less carbon to the atmosphere overall compared to all other restoration treatments and control areas. This restoration technique may be useful if the restoration goal is focused on returning the carbon storage function at disturbed sites. As well as understanding attainability of restoration goals, evaluating ecohydrologic conditions of oil sands exploration sites pre-restoration is critical for informing the most appropriate restoration technique.

AB Confocal laser scanning microscopy. using fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes targeting the 16S rRNA of different physiological groups of methanogens. was used to identify which methanogenic genera were present and to describe their in situ spatial locations in samples taken at different depths from blanket peat bog cures. Total bacterial DNA was also extracted and purified from the samples and used as template for amplification of 16S rRNA and regions of methyl CoM reductase-encoding genes using the polymerase chain reaction. as well as for oligonucleotide hybridisation experiments, These techniques. used in concert. demonstrated that methanogens of several physiological groups were present in highest numbers in the mid regions of 25 cm deep peat cures. Some discrepancies were apparent in the findings of the microscopic and molecular methods, though these may be partially accounted for by the different sensitivities of the techniques employed. The combined approaches used in this study gave an insight into the diversity and distribution of methanogens in peat environments not possible using molecular ecological methods alone.

AB The effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition to peatland ecosystem on emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured using the closed chamber method during one growing season within a peatland on the Tibetan Plateau. The highest N2O fluxes occurred during late spring (May), while fluxes of N2O were lowest during early autumn (September). No significant correlations were found between N2O emissions and soil temperature. Because of the sites stable hydrological conditions no evidence of correlations between N2O emissions and water content was found. There was a negative correlation between N2O fluxes and vegetation height. It was clearly shown that the emissions of N2O were significantly affected by increasing N availability. In contrast to that, no significant effect of P addition on the emissions of N2O was found in the present study.

AB Twenty-seven coal samples from the Barapukuria and Dighipara Coal Basins of Bangladesh were analysed for their maceral content, petrographic characteristics and vitrinite reflectance. The most predominant maceral was the inertinite group (mean 40%), followed by vitrinite (mean 31%) and liptinite (mean 22%), with considerable amounts of mineral matter (mean 7%). Semifusinite, fusinite and inertodetrinite were the most common macerals of the inertinite group. Collotelinite, collodetrinite and vitrodetrinite were the most frequently found macerals of the vitrinite group, while sporinite and cutinite were the most common in the liptinite group. Clay minerals occurred in higher concentrations than other minerals. The measured vitrinite reflectance values (%R-o) ranged from 0.71 to 0.80, indicating a high volatile bituminous B ranking. Facies modelling using maceral composition and maceral indices suggested an environment of forest swamps with alternating oxic-anoxic depositional conditions. Microlithotype-dependent depositional modelling indicated evolution in limno-telmatic zones under fluvio-lacustrine control, accompanied by the development of upper to lower deltaic plain conditions. A terrestrial origin with dry forest to piedmont plain conditions was suggested by the Gelification Index (Cl) and Tissue Preservation Index (TPI). The lateral variation of the measured TPI values indicated an increase in the rate of basin subsidence. A cross-plot of the Ground Water Index (GWI) vs. the Vegetation Index (VI) suggested mires under ombotrophic to mesotrophic hydrogeological conditions containing herbaceous plants.

AB We investigate the relationships between CO2 and CH4 fluxes across space and time at a temperate ombrotrophic bog in Canada to assess the coupling between plant production and CH4 emissions. Based on periodic manual chamber measurements, we show that maximum net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE.) was a good predictor of the spatial variations in CH4 flux among the wetter Eriophorum and lawn sites (r(2) = 0.61-0.88), but not the drier hummock sites (r(2) = 0.04-0.49). Also, we observed large interannual variability in the NEEmax-CH4 relationship at the Eriophorum and lawn sites, with a smaller regression slope in 2010 that had a seasonal mean water table 8 cm lower than in 2009. Results of cross-correlation of instantaneous gross ecosystem production (GEP) and CH4 flux from autochambers show a moderate relationship (sigma = -0.31) in the Eriophorum community at a lag of 9-12 h, suggesting a rapid turnover of recent photosynthate for methanogenesis. On the other hand, we found in two Maianthemum-dominated chambers that the temperature-independent residuals of daily mean CH4 flux lagged behind GEP by 18-26 days at the seasonal scale. The lagged correlations between GEP and CH4 flux by month were particularly strong in the late growing season in the Eriophorum and Maianthemum/Ledum communities. Our results suggest the presence of spatial and temporal coupling of plant production and CH4 emissions in this bog, whose strength varies with species composition, water table position, and plant phenology.

AB Year-round flooding can be a cost-effective measure for rewetting highly degraded fens, and is gaining popularity for lowland fen restoration in Europe. We investigated the short-term effects of such permanent inundation on species composition and spatial distribution of the vegetation of a formerly drained coastal fen, and addressed the question of whether re-establishment of peat-forming reed vegetation is foreseeable. For vegetation mapping and monitoring we combined permanent plot data acquired during four years following shallow flooding, high-resolution aerial imagery and an elevation model. Five vegetation types were distinguished, and we analysed their spatial distribution and succession patterns throughout the years. Preexisting vegetation, its spatial arrangement and the water level played major roles in secondary succession. Existing patches of Phragmites australis showed high stability, but their growth was not consistent through the years and at all inundation depths. Existing stands of Bolboschoenus maritimus were outcompeted by Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani or vanished and formed relatively stable ponds of open water with hydrophytic species. We concluded that the expansion of reed as peat-forming vegetation is likely to proceed slowly, but fluctuations in water level and edge effects will probably maintain a persistent mosaic of vegetation and open water in the near future.

AB Excess water in the rooting zone critically reduces tree growth and may even kill trees; however, the relative importance of damage to roots versus aboveground parts and the time course of damage are not well understood. We studied the dynamics of fine-root growth and mortality of 7-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) saplings affected by a 5-week period of waterlogging (WL) during the growing season. Two out of six WL-exposed saplings survived the treatment. After 1-2 weeks of WL, the mortality of the first-order short roots (usually mycorrhizas) started to increase and the production of these roots started to decrease. WL decreased the longevity of short and long roots. Total root length (especially of fine roots with a diameter < 0.5 mm), specific fine-root length, total root dry mass (including stump), and reverse-flow root hydraulic conductance were lower in WL saplings than in control saplings at the end of the experiment; however, several root traits were similar in control and surviving WL saplings. Because of the high importance of fine roots for tree growth and carbon sequestration, their responses to elevated water tables should be considered in sustainable use and management of boreal peatland forests, for example, by continuous cover forestry and (or) ditch network maintenance.

AB Upland moors and bogs in the United Kingdom are peatlands of high nature conservation value, many designated under the European Union's Habitat Directive, with internationally important bird populations, which depend on abundant invertebrate populations when breeding. Moorland management in the United Kingdom traditionally employs controlled burning in 10-30 year rotations of heather, Calluna vulgaris, creating habitat mosaics of different species composition and physical structure. This can increase overall invertebrate biodiversity and abundance, for certain key invertebrate groups. Burning has potential negative environmental effects, including peat erosion and contamination of drinking-water supplies. Rotational cutting of vegetation is now being trialled as an alternative to burning, but its long-term effects on invertebrates are poorly understood. We surveyed invertebrates on a 16-year chronosequence of rotational cutting on an extensive area of dwarf shrub vegetation on upland peat soils in Northern England. Invertebrate Simpson diversity was greatest on intermediate-aged patches, and along edges between cut and uncut areas. Older patches, cut between 2000 and 2008, were dominated by ants (Hymenoptera-Formicidae), plant-feeding bugs (Hemiptera-Auchenorrhyncha) and parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera-Parasitica). Patches cut more recently, between 2009 and 2016, had significantly lower invertebrate abundance, and were dominated by predatory ground beetles (Coleoptera-Carabidae), ants and harvestmen (Opiliones). There were significant relationships between vegetation and invertebrate community composition under both invertebrate sampling methods. We recommend that rotational cutting is used as the primary means of management, it should be undertaken in approximately 15-20 year rotations, in irregularly shaped mosaics, to maximise the benefits to invertebrates and associated wildlife.

AB Two conceptual models of plant zonation in peatland lakes are given. The first represents vegetation on slightly sloping substrate (N<0.2) in shallow and relatively large lakes. The vegetation is not diverse (H' = 0.0+/-0.01). The frequency and biomass of the dominant (Sphagnum denticulatum) correlate positively with lake size, and negatively with depth and substrate slope. They are also correlated with water transparency and water color (r = -0.53), concentrations of total organic carbon (r = -0.43), Ca2+ (r = 0.40) and humic acids (r = -0.46), and redox potential (r = 0.44). The second model represents vegetation on steep peat walls (N>0.3) in deep, usually small lakes. Plants occur only on the upper part of the peat wall or form a multispecies curtain hanging from the lip of peat at the top. Species diversity in this scenario is higher (H' = 0.18+/-0.17). The curtains usually are composed of mosses such as Warnstorfia exannulata, S. cuspidatum and S. riparium, and vascular plants are rare. The frequency and biomass of bryophytes in this type of structure are related to substrate slope (r = 0.56), lake depth (r = 0.56), Ca2+ concentration (r = -0.69) and water color (r = -0.51). In both models, plant biomass is correlated with temperature (r = -0.78), irradiance (r = -0.64) and water oxygenation (r = -0.54). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in tree-line, mean July temperature (T(jul) ) and mean annual precipitation (P(ann) ) for the last 10 200 cal. yr BP are reconstructed on the basis of pollen and plant macrofossils preserved in lake sediments from two sites near the present-day tree-line in Troms, northern Norway. Quantitative climate reconstructions are performed using pollen-climate transfer functions based on WA-PLS regression. Early Holocene Betula pubescens forests were gradually replaced by Pinus sylvestris at Dalmutladdo (355 m a.s.l.) starting about 7000 cal. yr BP. The local presence of pine woodland at that time is supported by finds of stomata and plant macrofossils and by high pollen accumulation rates. Until about 4000 cal. yr BP the P. sylvestris tree-line was 250-300 m higher than today, suggesting T(jul) about 2.0degreesC higher than at present. The later part of the Holocene has a cooler and moister climate and an increasing development of mires and fern-rich vegetation, as shown by increases of Sphagnum and fern spores and the re-establishment of B. pubescens woodland. The reconstructed T(jul) from the two sites shows similar trends to previously published data, with T(jul) 1-2degreesC warmer between 9500 cal. yr BP and 2000 cal. yr BP T(jul) . Maximum T(jul) values occur between 8500 and 4500 cal. yr BP, after which there is a gradual decrease in T(jul).

ID RESTORATION
AB White peat is the most important raw substrate component in professional horticulture. Worldwide harvesting of peat leads to the unrecoverable destruction of bogs, its unique biodiversity, and in addition to the release of climate relevant carbon dioxide. Peat is a finite resource and its stocks in Western and Central Europe are nearly depleted. White peat mainly consists of rare decomposed peat mosses. An alternative to the use of white peat could be the use of peat moss biomass. We studied the cultivation of Sphagnum mosses, grown on buoyant carriers systems on surface mining lakes in Eastern Germany. Three peat moss species (Sphagnum fimbriatum, S. palustre, S. fallax) where cultivated. Using different coverage's (straw, net, and a combination) biomass accumulation differed and was highest when straw was used. Biomass accumulation also differed between lakes and species but was at a maximum as high as 5.4 t ha-(1) year-(1). The potential of producing peat moss for horticultural production systems is encouraging and discussed in the manuscript.

AB Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were monitored in rewetted peatlands planted to rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California. The effect of N fertilization was examined with a rate trial (0, 80, and 160 kg N ha(-1)). Static chambers and C-13-CO2 pulse labeling at reproductive growth and grain-filling stages when maximum CH4 emission is anticipated were used to quantify the contribution of rice plants to soil C pools. Soil CH4 and N2O emissions were not affected by N fertilization and ranged from 66 to 123 kg CH4 ha(-1) and 1.2 to 3.7 kg N2O ha(-1), respectively. There was no stimulating effect of N fertilization on vegetative production, root biomass, or grain yield, indicating the existence of a large N pool in the rewetted peat soils. Nitrogen fertilization increased the contribution of rice C inputs to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool at the highest rate, but not to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pore water CH4 (CH4-pore), or emitted CH4. Across treatments, plant-derived C contributed up to 27% of emitted CH4, up to 9.1% of the DOC, and 13 to 78% of DIC. Negative N2O emissions were frequently observed during the growing season with a maximal consumption of -0.51 mg N2O m(-2) d(-1), which was not affected by N fertilization. These results demonstrate that N fertilization at rates up to 160 kg N ha(-1) in rewetted degraded peat soils does not affect annual CH4 and N2O emissions.

AB Bryophyte substrates and species may affect spore germination through allelopathy. Polytrichum strictum is currently expanding in peatlands in north-eastern China is this an effect of its superior spore germinability or do its gametophytes have a stronger allelopathic effect than do Sphagnum? We conducted a spore burial experiment to test the effect of species identity, substrate and water table depth (WTD) on spore germinability and bryophyte allelopathic effect with P. strictum and two Sphagnum species (S. palustre and S. magellanicum). After 5 months of burial during a growing, season, the spores were tested for germinability. Allelopathic effect of bryophyte substrates was assessed by the difference between spore germinability after being stored inside or outside the substrates. After burial, more than 90% of the spores lost their germinability across all three species due to ageing and allelopathy. Spore germinability differed among species, where the spores in S. palustre had a higher germination frequency than those in P. strictum. The three bryophytes maintained a higher germinability in Sphagnum than in Polytrichum hummocks, probably due to a stronger allelopathic effect of P. strictum. Water table draw down by 10 cm increased germinability by more than 60% across the three species. The study indicates that P. strictum does not possess an advantage regarding spore germination but rather its gametophytes have a stronger allelopathic effect Due to the weaker inhibitive effect of Sphagnum gametophytes, P. strictum may have a potential establishment superiority over Sphagnum in peatlands, in addition to a better drought tolerance, which may explain its current expansion.

AB Two 17,000-yr-old peat bog records from low-elevation sites in Tierra del Fuego (Harberton, 54 degrees 54'S) and southern Patagonia (Rio Rubens, 52 degrees 4'48 '' S) and one c. 14,000 cal yr BP record from the upper treeline in Tierra del Fuego (Paso Garibaldi, 54 degrees 43'S) were analyzed for pollen, charcoal, and plant macrofossils to reconstruct changes in regional and local vegetation, fire frequency, and bog hydrology, respectively. Past environmental changes in both lowland records and in the upper treeline record are interpreted in terms of variations in effective moisture. During the late-glacial period, effective moisture changes at both low and high-elevation sites were interpreted from comparable shifts between mesic herb-rich grasslands and arid Empetrum heath or shrub-grassland with abundant disturbance indicators. The late-glacial effective moisture changes were primarily driven by temperature changes. During the early Holocene, expansion of open Nothofagus woodlands in the lowlands in present-day areas of dense forest was related to a marked precipitation increase. However, precipitation must have remained highly variable with century-long periods of increased summer drought, as evidenced by repeated intervals when bogs dried out and fire frequency was high. Up-slope shifts of the Nothofagus forest Andean tundra ecotone at 11,000 and 9000 cal yr BP also appear to reflect precipitation increases. Precipitation variability, however, must not have affected the upper treeline environments as no fires were recorded and the present-day Nothofagus forest had become established after 9000 cal yr BP. Upper treeline apparently was below present from 8000 to 7000 and 2500 to c. 400 cal yr BP. During those times low-elevation environments did not register change which suggests that the upper treeline may have been affected by lower temperatures. After c. 5000 cal yr BP fires became rare in the lowlands, suggesting a shift to an equable precipitation regime with only minor intervals of summer drought. No simultaneous change was recorded at the upper treeline. Thus, for the late-glacial and early Holocene the upper and lower treeline environments apparently responded similarly to primarily moisture changes. Only during the mid- and late Holocene environmental changes at high and low elevations differed, suggesting responses to different climate signals, precipitation in the lowlands and temperature at high elevation.

AB Soil scarification is one of the main methods for enhancing natural regeneration and it is widely used before seeding and planting as well. The aim of this research was to assess the effect of soil scarification on natural regeneration in the 11-year-old forest regeneration areas in fertile mineral soil and peatland sites. After clear-cutting, these areas were disc-trenched with Donaren 190 and inventoried after the first growing season. The inventory was performed using rectangular sample plots ranging in size from 10x10 to 15x20 m. The number of all woody plants was determined by microsites untreated area, furrow, slope, and ridge. The same inventory was redone 11 growing seasons later.
   After 11 growth years, a large number of Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) was found in Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Oxalis site types and drained peatlands, with 2,600-5,300 trees per hectare. The number of pine plants on microsites on mineral soil was the greatest in furrows and on slopes (33.5% and 30.4%), and on peat soil on slopes and in untreated areas (38.3% and 52.1%). The number of naturally regenerated Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) trees was the largest in Oxalis-Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium myrtillus and Oxalis site types, with 2,000 3,000 plants per hectare. With regard to microsites, spruce plants were the most abundant in untreated areas and in furrows on mineral soil (23.2% and 34.6%) and in untreated areas and on slopes on peat soil (54.3% and 37.0%). Among deciduous trees, birches (Betula pendula Roth., Betula pubecens Ehrh.) and aspens (Populus tremula L.) as well as other deciduous trees (Salix sp. L., Tilia cordata L., Alnus sp L.. Sorbus aucuparia L., Prunus padus L., Fraxinus excelsior L.) were mostly growing in untreated areas on both mineral and peat soil. Soil scarification increased consistently the number of conifer seedlings in the sites typical of Norway spruce and Scots pine (p<0.05), where no effect was detected in the number of deciduous saplings.

AB Permafrost-affected soils in the Northern latitudes store huge amounts of organic carbon (OC) that is prone to microbial degradation and subsequent release of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. In Greenland, the consequences of permafrost thaw have only recently been addressed, and predictions on its impact on the carbon budget are thus still highly uncertain. However, the fate of OC is not only determined by abiotic factors, but closely tied to microbial activity. We investigated eight soil profiles in northeast Greenland comprising two sites with typical tundra vegetation and one wet fen site. We assessed microbial community structure and diversity (SSU rRNA gene tag sequencing, quantification of bacteria, archaea and fungi), and measured hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities. Sampling site and thus abiotic factors had a significant impact on microbial community structure, diversity and activity, the wet fen site exhibiting higher potential enzyme activities and presumably being a hot spot for anaerobic degradation processes such as fermentation and methanogenesis. Lowest fungal to bacterial ratios were found in topsoils that had been relocated by cryoturbation ("buried topsoils"), resulting from a decrease in fungal abundance compared to recent ("unburied") topsoils. Actinobacteria On particular Intrasporangiaceae) accounted for a major fraction of the microbial community in buried topsoils, but were only of minor abundance in all other soil horizons. It was indicated that the distribution pattern of Actinobactena and a variety of other bacterial classes was related to the activity of phenol oxidases and peroxidases supporting the hypothesis that bacteria might resume the role of fungi in oxidative enzyme production and degradation of phenolic and other complex substrates in these soils. Our study sheds light on the highly diverse, but poorly-studied communities in permafrost-affected soils in Greenland and their role in OC degradation.

AB A core consisting of minerogenic peat and organic-rich mineral sediments was collected at an altitude of 4275 m in the Ovejuyo valley, 100 km NE of La Paz in Bolivia. Age dating with Pb-210 showed that the core represents approximately three centuries of sediment accumulation. None of the peats are ombrotrophic. Despite this, the Cd/Al, Cu/Al, Zn/Al, and Pb/Al ratios are all significantly higher in the surface layers, particularly in the top 6 cm: natural, abiological geochemical processes, therefore, cannot account for these elevated heavy metal/Al ratios. There are two possible explanations for the metal enrichments, relative to Al, in the surface layers: bioaccumulation by living plants, and anthropogenic atmospheric metal deposition. While the living plant layer may be responsible for the Cd, Cu, and Zn enrichments, this is an unlikely explanation for the Pb profile. In contrast to the other metals, the concentration of Pb in the first sample (dating from 1985-1994) is less than that of the second sample (dating from 1970-1985). The Pb/Al profile is consistent with the well documented, rapid increase in atmospheric Pb emissions during the present century (which accelerated following the introduction of leaded gasoline), and the decline in Pb pollution during the past 20 years (as a result of the introduction of unleaded gasoline). Thus, the Ovejuyo Valley mire has provided one of the first records of atmospheric Pb pollution in South America.

AB The environmental importance of peatlands has stimulated efforts to restore their specific ecosystem structure and functions. Monitoring and assessment of the ecological state of the peatland is fundamental in restoration programmes. Most studies have focused on the responses of vegetation and, to a lesser extent, on testate amoebae (TA). To our knowledge, none have investigated whether these two groups show concordance in the context of restoration of drained peatland. Here we assess community concordance between TA and vegetation in boreal peatlands belonging to four different land use management classes (natural, drained, restored 3-7 years ago, and restored 9-12 years ago). TA and vegetation communities were concordant when all of the studied sites were compared. However, there was no concordance within management classes except for sites restored 3-7 years ago. We found that TA and vegetation communities are not surrogates of one another when measuring the success of restoration, and that thorough studies of both communities are required to build a holistic understanding of the changes during restoration from an ecosystem perspective. TA seemed to respond faster to changes caused by restoration and, hence, could be better early indicators of restoration success than plants. Furthermore, studies of the relationships between TA and plant communities could provide important insights to aid understanding of the link between the recovery of ecosystem structure and the reinstatement of ecosystem functions.

AB With 6.5 m of peat accumulated during the past ca. 15,000 years, Etang de la Gruere (EGr) represents the longest continuous record of atmospheric dust deposition in northern hemisphere. This paper presents a comparative study of the mineralogical composition of Sphagnum peat samples and their corresponding humic acids (HA) from a peat core collected at EGr bog. The purpose of this study was to better understand the dominant process responsible for the amount and distribution of mineral matter in ombrotrophic (i.e., rain-fed) peat. Specifically, the goal was to separate the relative importance of the changing rates of atmospheric mineral dust deposition (during the past two millennia) from the mineralization of organic matter (OM), for the distribution of the ash fraction of the peat profile.
   The results suggest that variations in ash content at EGr are mainly the result of an increase in the rate of supply of dust particles and cannot be attributed simply, or exclusively, to differences in the degree of OM decay: evidence is provided by both acid insoluble ash (AIA) profiles and the correlations among lithogenic elements (Al, Si, Ti, Y, and Zr), total ash content and AIA. Moreover, our findings suggest that part of the AIA occurring in peat extremely is stable, and is unaffected by the extreme chemical conditions used to extract the HA fraction: this may be partly due to the inherent stability of quartz and "heavy minerals" such as zircon and rutile, but organic coatings developed on mineral surfaces during peat diagenesis, or the formation of some other kind of organo-mineral complex, might also play a role. Consequently, testimonies of past dust depositions can be observed also into the recalcitrant HA fraction of the peat. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Northern peatlands constitute an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle due to their long-term accumulation of soil organic matter. This function as a carbon sink is partly dependent on low temperatures limiting decomposition and nutrient cycling, so global warming has the potential to alter the C balance of these systems and feedback to climate change. Field observations have shown that peatland organic matter decomposition, ecosystem respiration and nitrogen cycling are closely related processes that show a large degree of temperature sensitivity. In the current study, we investigated whether seasonal dynamics of substrate input may be an indirect mechanism accounting for this observed sensitivity. We carried out a 60-day mesocosm incubation experiment with sub-arctic peat soil to compare the direct effects of temperature increase with the indirect effects of increased microbial- or plant-derived organic matter input on key soil C and N cycling processes and substrate pools. Additions of dead microbial cells led to an 83% increase in organic N pool sizes, 16-64% increases in the potential activities of most soil enzymes, a transient increase in the relative abundance of beta-proteobacteria, and a decrease in the relative abundance of alpha-proteo-, Actino- and Acido-bacteria. Neither the addition of plant root litter, nor a 5 degrees C alteration in incubation temperatures, had comparable effects on these parameters. Peat respiration was positively affected by both substrate addition (20-46% increase) and higher incubation temperatures (34-38% increase), but the temperature-only effect was not sufficient to account for the increases in respiration observed in field experiments. Thus, it appears that warming effects on C and N cycle processes can potentially be driven by indirect effects, with alterations to the seasonal flux of microbe-derived organic matter a particularly potent mechanism. The high temperature sensitivity of decomposition and respiration may therefore be largely a result of warming-induced changes in substrate supply rates. We propose that climate change models of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling should seek to incorporate realistic microbial biomass dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Species composition of peatlands is determined by the dominance of either Sphagnum or non-sphagnaceous (brown) mosses. Sphagnum species are more or less intolerant to alkaline waters rich in calcium bicarbonate, but the physiological background of this intolerance is poorly understood. Recently, sphagna have been widening their realized niches, expanding to alkaline brown-moss fens and altering their functioning. One possible reason is increased nutrient availability, but existing evidence is equivocal. We approached this problem by a series of laboratory experiments with 15 fen moss species cultivated submerged in solutions corresponding to natural poor- to rich-fen waters. We tested basic ecophysiological mechanisms of calcium tolerance (ion compartmentalization, cell-wall cation-binding properties, phosphorus and iron uptake), the breadth of fundamental pH/calcium niches for protonemata and adult plants, interspecific competition, and relationships between nutrient availability and pH/calcium tolerance. Our results suggest that calcium toxicity in calcifugous bryophytes is caused by insufficient control over the balance of intracellular Ca2+ uptake/efflux. Cell-wall cation-exchange sites of living mosses remain unsaturated with Ca2+ even in calcareous solutions, contradicting the proposed inhibitory effect of Ca2+-oversaturation on cell-wall expansion and monovalent cation uptake. Growth and biomass accumulation of brown mosses was highest in alkaline fen waters, but they could also survive and germinate in poor-fen waters. Calcium-tolerant sphagna survived along the entire poor rich gradient, but their growth was inhibited by calcium bicarbonate. The three most obviously expanding sphagna produced protonemata even under calcareous conditions. Flowing but not stagnant alkaline fen waters were toxic for calcifugous sphagna, the strongest competitors in poor-fen waters. Increased potassium availability facilitated the survival of calcifugous sphagna in alkaline fens, corroborating field observations that potassium facilitates sphagnum expansion. Surprisingly, the rare and declining moss Hamatocaulis vernicosus was supported by nitrogen and phosphorus more than its competitors. Our comparison of fundamental and realized niches suggests that the dominance of particular moss functional groups in fens is governed by a competitive hierarchy altered by different calcium levels. The expansion of calcium-tolerant sphagna into brown-moss fens therefore requires perturbation that weakens competition. Additionally, expansion of calcifugous sphagna to alkaline environments may be stimulated by potassium availability. (C) 2015 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB This study investigated the abundance, distribution, and composition of microbial communities at the watershed scale in a boreal peatland within the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), Minnesota, USA. Through a close coupling of next-generation sequencing, biogeochemistry, and advanced analytical chemistry, a biogeochemical hot spot was revealed in the mesotelm (30- to 50-cm depth) as a pronounced shift in microbial community composition in parallel with elevated peat decomposition. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria and the Syntrophobacteraceae, including known hydrocarbon-utilizing genera, was positively correlated with carbohydrate and organic acid content, showing a maximum in the mesotelm. The abundance of Archaea (primarily crenarchaeal groups 1.1c and 1.3) increased with depth, reaching up to 60% of total small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences in the deep peat below the 75-cm depth. Stable isotope geochemistry and potential rates of methane production paralleled vertical changes in methanogen community composition to indicate a predominance of acetoclastic methanogenesis mediated by the Methanosarcinales in the mesotelm, while hydrogen-utilizing methanogens predominated in the deeper catotelm. RNA-derived pyrosequence libraries corroborated DNA sequence data to indicate that the above-mentioned microbial groups are metabolically active in the mid-depth zone. Fungi showed a maximum in rRNA gene abundance above the 30-cm depth, which comprised only an average of 0.1% of total bacterial and archaeal rRNA gene abundance, indicating prokaryotic dominance. Ratios of C to P enzyme activities approached 0.5 at the acrotelm and catotelm, indicating phosphorus limitation. In contrast, P limitation pressure appeared to be relieved in the mesotelm, likely due to P solubilization by microbial production of organic acids and C-P lyases. Based on path analysis and the modeling of community spatial turnover, we hypothesize that P limitation outweighs N limitation at MEF, and microbial communities are structured by the dominant shrub, Chamaedaphne calyculata, which may act as a carbon source for major consumers in the peatland.

AB A peat monolith representing up to 4,000 years of peat accumulation near Manchester, England, was collected. Major and trace elements were analysed with XRF and for Cd and Pb in the deeper samples with GF-AAS following acid digestion. Pb isotopic composition was measured with TIMS and ICP-MS. The results show a pollution since the Roman Period due to local lead sources and an increase in lead pollution in the last century due to leaded gasoline as fingerprinted by Pb isotopic signatures.

AB Using the large-scale thick 4# coal seam from the Mid-Jurassic in the southern Ordos Basin as an example, this paper studied the net primary productivity (NPP) level of the Mid-Jurassic peatland, and discussed its control factors. Geophysical logging signals were used for a spectrum analysis to obtain the Milankovitch cycle parameters in coal seam. These were then used to calculate the accumulation rate of the residual carbon in 4# coal seam. The carbon loss can be calculated according to the density and residual carbon content of 4# coal seam. Then, the total carbon accumulation rate of the peatland was further derived, and the NPP of peatland was determined. The results show that the NPP of MidJurassic peatland is higher than that of Holocene at the same latitude. Comprehensive analysis indicates that the temperature, carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in atmosphere are the main control factors of the NPP of Mid-Jurassic peatland.

AB Peatlands cover very large extents in northern regions and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle by functioning as a carbon sink. Large-scale satellite based monitoring systems, such as the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), are necessary to improve our understanding of how these ecosystems respond to climate change by providing verifiable land products. For instance, satellite-based land product validation approaches can benefit from airborne hyperspectral imagery and in-situ data, which provide higher spatial and spectral resolution baselines, ideal for measuring vegetation changes (e.g. phenology, LAI) at local scales. Here, we assessed the short-term phenospectral dynamics (spectral changes indicated by specific spectral features as a function of phenology) of five ombrotrophic peatland vegetation physiognomies over four dates at the Mer Bleue bog in Canada. We took advantage of a unique remote sensing data acquisition campaign aiming to validate Sentinel-2A land products, and analyzed three spatially and spectrally distinctive datasets (i.e. field spectra, VISNIR airborne hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and Sentinel-2A imagery) over the first half of the 2016 growing season. By implementing a bottom-up approach, first we assessed the airborne HSI's capability to detect phenological changes as compared to in-situ acquired field spectroscopy measurements in a 10 ha area at Mer Bleue and evaluated the spectral features characteristic of these phenological changes. Second, over the entire Mer Bleue area (28,000 ha), we compared a series of four Sentinel-2A images to four airborne HSI mosaics (spatially and spectrally resampled to Sentinel-2A) to assess the utility of Sentinel-2A for detecting small spectral variations due to phenological changes (i.e. greening). In addition, for this second comparison, three spectral vegetation indices were derived from the Sentinel-2A images and the airborne HSI mosaics. The spectral comparisons between the airborne HSI and the field spectroscopy data revealed clear phenological changes from the airborne HSI. For instance, a closer agreement between reflectance measured by the field spectrometer and the airborne HSI spectral response was found in the visible region (450-680 nm). A greater difference however, was consistently seen in the near-infrared region (681-866 nm) across the four dates. Narrow spectral features in three regions of the visible range (global minima, red absorption, green peak), indicating changes in vegetation colour, were consistent for both datasets and with expected phenological patterns at Mer Bleue. At the landscape level, Sentinel-2A mirrored the spectral changes depicted by the resampled HSI data. However, band level, pair-wise comparisons showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in reflectance for each band, with Sentinel-2A exhibiting higher reflectance values than the HSI for the first three dates. Only for the last date (June 23rd) did the airborne HSI have higher reflectance values or no significant difference with the Sentinel-2A data. Overall, our three datasets captured the short-term phenological changes at Mer Bleue and have provided promising results in terms of using the Sentinel-2A MSI sensor to monitor these changes at the landscape level.

AB This paper presents a pedometric approach to updating the Dutch 1:50,000 national soil map for the peatlands, and illustrates this approach for a 187,525 ha area in the northern peatlands. This is the first time that digital soil mapping replaces conventional soil mapping in a nationwide, government-funded soil survey program in the Netherlands. Soil classes were updated indirectly through mapping two quantitative diagnostic soil properties: the thickness and starting depth of the peat layer. From these, five major soil groups could be constructed. Because the point data were zero-inflated, a two-step simulation approach was implemented. First, peat presence/absence indicators were simulated from probabilities of peat occurrence that were predicted with a generalized linear model. Second, conditional peat thickness values were simulated from kriging with external drift predictions. The indicator and peat thickness simulations were combined to obtain simulations of the unconditional peat thickness. A similar approach was followed for the starting depth. From the simulated soil properties, probability distributions of soil groups were derived. These groups were refined with information on (static) soil properties derived from the 1:50,000 map to obtain soil classes according to the 1:50,000 legend. The updated raster map was then incorporated in the 1:50,000 polygon map. The prediction models were calibrated with legacy point data, that were updated for peat thickness before being used, in addition to a set of newly acquired point data. The uncertainty associated to the updated peat thickness values in the legacy dataset was quantified and accounted for by the prediction models. The peat thickness map and a map with three soil orders were validated with independent probability sample data. The overall purity of the soil order map was 66% for both subareas. For subarea 1 this was a 12% purity improvement compared to the current 1:50,000 map, for subarea 2 this was 3%. For subarea 1, the mean absolute error of the predicted peat thickness was 23.5 cm, and the R-2 is 0.50. For subarea 2 these accuracy measures were 30.9 cm and 0.65. We conclude that nationwide updating the 1:50,000 map with pedometric techniques is feasible. In order to increase the value and usability of the legacy point data as well as the large set of newly acquired field observations and the updated 1:50,000 map, we recommend installation of a soil monitoring network in the Dutch peatlands.

AB Peatlands on the Tibetan Plateau play crucial roles in regional carbon cycling but faced serious degradation in recent decades, and hydrological restoration is being conducted to regain their ecosystem function. However, how restoration affects the environmental controls on carbon processes of these unique ecosystems remains unclear, and the role of vegetation community in regulating carbon processes in response to the restoration is unknown. A long dam was built at the outlet of a large shallow lake on the plateau in order to evaluate the effects of hydrological restoration on the carbon sequestration of the world's largest alpine peatlands. The carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from three widely distributed peatland communities, i.e., Kobresia pusilla, Carex enervis, and Carex rnuliensis commuities, were investigated immediately before and after restoration. The water table rising as a consequence of restoration, at least temporarily, decreased the carbon consumption rate (plant respiration plus soil decomposition) for each unit of carbon fixation by plants, which is community dependent. However, a positive relationship between temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and optimal water table for respiration implies a positive feedback between water table rising and warming on R-eco. Meanwhile, the dominant factor explaining the variance of R-eco shifted from soil temperature (explained 56%) to water table (explained 68%) after restoration. Water table rising enhanced the CH4 emissions by 3-12 times, with significantly different changes in CH4 flux over a standard variation in water table level among the communities. Temperature was excluded while only water table and vegetation type were included in the model to predict CH4 fluxes after restoration in contrast to before. We argue that the shift of driving environmental factors and the role of vegetation community are essential in evaluating the effects of hydrological restoration on carbon cycling of Plateau peatlands, particularly during the transitional period.

AB Both bog surface wetness and atmospheric dust deposition are intricately linked to changes in the hydrological cycle and pairing these types of records at the same site provides complementary information. Here a peat core from Store Mosse in southern Sweden covering the last 8500 years was used to make a high-resolution paleoclimate reconstruction based on a combination of bog development, colourimetric humification and inorganic geochemistry data. The coupling of Principal Component Analysis with changepoint modelling allowed for precise linking of changes in bog surface wetness and dust deposition records.
   A long-term trend towards warm (and possibly wet) conditions starts ca 8150 cal yr BP and culminates with the most pronounced conditions from 6900 to 6600 cal yr BP. The most significant arid period at Store Mosse occurred between 6500 and 5600 cal yr BP during which dust deposition was significantly higher. Wetter conditions dominate from 5500 to 4980 cal yr BP as the transition from the Hypsithermal and into the Neoglacial is made. After a shift to drier conditions, humification enters a more stable period that lasts from 4525 until 3200 cal yr BP. It is during this time that the first possible anthropogenic dust signals occur at ca 4200 cal yr BP. From 3200 cal yr BP to present humification generally shows a long-term decline moving towards wetter conditions. The main exceptions are during the transition from the Neoglacial to Roman Warm Period which is registered as a significantly wetter period and two dry periods recorded 2365 to 2155 cal yr BP and 1275-1105 cal yr BP. In general, the observed changes agree well with regional records of effective humidity and temperature. The high temporal resolution of the Store Mosse record reveals that palaeoclimatic change over the last 8500 years in southern Sweden has had a complex and variable structure. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peatlands are peculiar ecosystems in which well-adapted communities grow and develop, recording the variation in climate and hydrological conditions inland. In addition necromass is well preserved and therefore peatlands can be used as palaeo-archives for environmental variation. In this work a peat core of depth 60 cm dated at the bottom of the peat deposit as ca. 250 cal AD from Huelga de Bayas (Asturias, Northern Spain) was studied to a resolution of 2-4 cm to investigate the evolution of the environmental conditions in the area. Samples were extracted with a dichloromethane/methanol ratio of 3:1 and studied by means of gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in order to identify possible biomarkers of climatic variation during the period of peat formation. Lipid biomarker study allows the identification of periods in which Sphagnum or higher plants preferentially contributed to the peat profile. The absolute dating of the profile combined with the n-alkane record displayed five episodes of wetter conditions around ca. 250 cal AD (Roman Warm Period), 1080 and 1270 cal AD (Medieval Warm Period), 1460 cal AD (Little Ice Age) and 1920 cal AD (Recent warming), which are consistent with climate evolution in the region. Pentacyclic triterpenoids with hopane skeleton derived from microorganisms and with oleanane skeleton derived from higher plants were identified. The presence of their ketone and acetyl-derivatives, along with the presence of unstable hopane configurations indicates a low maturity of the peat profile. A tendency for the functionalised triterpenoids to decrease with depth was observed in the profile. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland landscapes typically exhibit large variations in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to microtopographic and vegetation heterogeneity. As many peatland budgets are extrapolated from small-scale chamber measurements it is important to both quantify and understand the processes underlying this spatial variability. Here we carried out a mesocosm study which allowed a comparison to be made between different microtopographic features and vegetation communities, in response to conditions of both static and changing water table. Three mesocosm types (hummocks + Juncus effusus, hummocks + Eriophorum vaginatum, and hollows dominated by moss) were subjected to two water table treatments (0-5 cm and 30-35 cm depth). Measurements were made of soil-atmosphere GHG exchange, GHG concentration within the peat profile and soil water solute concentrations. After 14 weeks the high water table group was drained and the low water table group flooded. Measurement intensity was then increased to examine the immediate response to change in water table position. Mean CO2, CH4 and N2O exchange across all chambers was 39.8 mu g m(-2) s(-1), 54.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and -2.9 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Hence the GHG budget was dominated in this case by CO2 exchange. CO2 and N2O emissions were highest in the low water table treatment group; CH4 emissions were highest in the saturated mesocosms. We observed a strong interaction between mesocosm type and water table for CH4 emissions. In contrast to many previous studies, we found that the presence of aerenchyma-containing vegetation reduced CH4 emissions. A significant pulse in both CH4 and N2O emissions occurred within 1-2 days of switching the water table treatments. This pulsing could potentially lead to significant underestimation of landscape annual GHG budgets when widely spaced chamber measurements are upscaled.

AB For the first time, a model that simulates methane emissions from northern peatlands is incorporated directly into a dynamic global vegetation model. The model, LPJ-WHyMe (LPJ Wetland Hydrology and Methane), was previously modified in order to simulate peatland hydrology, permafrost dynamics and peatland vegetation. LPJ-WHyMe simulates methane emissions using a mechanistic approach, although the use of some empirical relationships and parameters is unavoidable. The model simulates methane production, three pathways of methane transport (diffusion, plant-mediated transport and ebullition) and methane oxidation. A sensitivity test was conducted to identify the most important factors influencing methane emissions, followed by a parameter fitting exercise to find the best combination of parameter values for individual sites and over all sites. A comparison of model results to observations from seven sites resulted in normalised root mean square errors (NRMSE) of 0.40 to 1.15 when using the best site parameter combinations and 0.68 to 1.42 when using the best overall parameter combination.

AB The importance of vegetation in affecting CH4 emissions was investigated in a Carex-dominated fen located near Schefferville, Quebec, and in the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario. Comparison of emission rates with and without the presence of aboveground vegetation indicated that over 90% of the emission was plant-associated transport. Further evidence of this association was found in a linear correlation of CH4 emission with aboveground plant biomass (R=0.93). To test the importance of aboveground plant photosynthetic production on methane production, aboveground vegetation was clipped from sites continually over the growing season. Both emissions and dissolved pore water CH4 were reduced relative to adjacent vegetated areas. A significant correlation (R=0.93) of CH4 emissions with net CO2 exchange in this fen gives evidence of the close association between new plant production and methanogenesis.

AB Peatlands are important carbon (C) stores as a result of acidity, waterlogging conditions and low temperatures slowing decomposition rates. However, climate change is predicted to bring not only changes in abiotic conditions but also the replacement of peat-forming vegetation, such as Sphagnum mosses, with vascular plants. In these systems, enchytraeid worms represent the dominant mesofaunal group, and previous climate change manipulations have shown that their abundances and vertical distribution are strongly influenced by temperature and moisture gradients, with important implications for C cycling. Therefore, determining their behavioural responses to changes in both abiotic and biotic factors is crucial to quantify their contribution to decomposition processes.
   We investigated the importance of vertical edaphic gradients (soil moisture and labile C) on enchytraeids total numbers, vertical distribution and feeding activities by inverting intact soil cores and hence, reversing both substrate quality but leaving the microclimatic gradients intact. This manipulative experiment was set up in two different peatland areas, one dominated by heather (Erica mackaiana) and another by mosses (Sphagnum sp.) to determine the influence of different plant functional growth forms on these responses.
   Our results showed that most enchytraeid species were 'stayers' (i.e. in the 'Upturned cores', they remained in the same layer where they are 'Normally' located), and hence, their vertical distribution was more dependent on substrate quality than a change in microclimate. This response was more evident under drier conditions (i.e. the highest locations of the height gradient at the heather site) than at the wettest locations (i.e. the bottom of the slope and under mosses) due to more pronounced vertical gradients in substrate quality. Furthermore, radiocarbon measurements on enchytraeid tissues showed that to avoid competition among the growing populations for the limited labile resources present in the top layers, enchytraeids selected older C sources.
   These findings indicate that future climate change scenarios will not only bring important changes in the abiotic conditions (temperature and moisture) and biotic properties of peatlands (both vegetation composition and below-ground soil biota community structure and vertical distribution) but also alterations in the feeding preferences of key decomposers that could result in the mobilization of previously unavailable C pools.

AB Eddy correlation measurements of methane flux were made at a fen in central Saskatchewan, as part of the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) in 1994. Data were collected from mid-May to early October. The water table was above the average peat surface throughout the measurement period. Detailed (near continuous) measurements allowed examination of temporal variability at hourly and daily timescales. As compared with the average nighttime flux, the average daytime methane flux was 25-45% higher in July and in August and 5-15% higher earlier and later in the season. Distribution of midday (1130-1430 LT) methane emission showed varying trends in different parts of the season. From mid-May to early July, methane flux gradually increased from near zero to 4.1 mg m(-2) h(-1). The water table height (above an average hollow surface) varied from 0.09 to 0.18 m, but the trend in methane flux followed peat temperature (at 0.1-m depth) more closely. The peat warmed from 3.4 degrees to 16.3 degrees C during this time period. Methane flux was negligible until peat temperature (at 0.1-m depth) was above 12 degrees C. From early July to early August there was a fivefold increase in methane flux from 4.1 to its seasonal peak of 19.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) on August 1. The water table ranged from 0.23 m to a brief seasonal plateau of 0.30 m on July 20-23. Sharp increases in the water table were followed by increasing trends in methane flux by approximately 12 days. Feat temperature reached its seasonal maximum (19.3 degrees C) the same time when the methane flux peaked. After early August the methane flux declined steadily and reached a value of 2.4 mg m(-2) h(-1) in early October. The water table and peat temperature showed comparable trends and decreased steadily to 0.06 m and 5.7 degrees C, respectively. The seasonally integrated methane emission (mid-May to early October) was estimated at 16.3 g C m(-2). Nonlinear regression analysis of methane flux against water table (lagged by 12 days) and peat temperature was performed for different periods of the season. Except for a brief period of very high water table (when many hummocks were inundated) the regression using water table and peat temperature explained between 68 and 94% of the variability in methane flux. The sensitivity of methane flux to water table (or the slope of the log CH4 flux/water table relationship) obtained from our daily flux values ranged from 3.4 x 10(-4) to 5.0 x 10(-4) m(-1).

AB Lead-210 chronologies, vertical S concentration gradients and delta S-34 values are presented for 5 Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs located in Central Europe (Rybarenska slat and Ocean Bog; Czech Republic) and the British Isles (Thorne Moors, England; Connemara, Ireland; and Mull, Scotland). Sulfur concentrations were measured in three 40-cm deep peat cores per site, sectioned into 2-cm segments. The coefficient of variation in S concentrations was low across all depths and sites (mean of 16%), indicating a high degree of within-site homogeneity in vertical S patterns. Similar S concentration trends and similar delta S-34 trends were found at all study sites. With an increasing peat depth, S concentrations first increased and then decreased. S concentrations peaked in layers which were deposited in ca. 1959, 1907, 1945, 1899 and 1799 at Rybarenska slat, Ocean, Thorne Moors, Connemara and Mull, respectively. Atmospheric S deposition peaked in 1972 in the UK and in 1987 in the Czech Republic. Due to downward S mobility in peat, S concentration maxima were found in layers 59 ( 19) a older that the year of the actual peak in S input. With an increasing depth, the maturating peat substrate at all sites exhibited first a negative delta S-34 shift, resulting from dissimilatory bacterial SO4 reduction, and then a positive delta S-34 shift, which may be related to advancing S mineralization. Minimum delta S-34 values were detected in layers which were deposited in ca. 1988, 1982, 1945, 1940 and 1978. A comparison of historical delta S-34 signatures of atmospheric S in England, measured on archived grain from the Broadbalk experiment (18451994), with delta S-34 values of Thorne Moors peat (1830-1994) also indicated mobility of S in peat. Sulfur mobility in water-logged peat is of concern during the present period of easing industrial pollution because SO4 released from peat-lands may increase the acidity of the output.

AB The Kyoto Protocol accepts terrestrial sinks for greenhouse gases (GHGs) as offsets for fossil fuel emissions. Only carbon sequestered in Living biomass from re- and afforestation is presently considered, but the Protocol contains a provision for the possible future inclusion of other land uses and soils. As a result, the possibility of sequestration of carbon in wetlands, and particularly peatlands, is being discussed. Natural peatlands are presently a relatively small sink for CO2 and a large source of CH4: globally, they store between 400 and 500 Gt C. There are large variations among peatlands, but when the "global warming potential" of CH4 is factored in, many peatlands are neither sinks nor sources of GHGs. Some land-use changes may result in peatlands acting as net sinks far GHGs by reducing CH4 emissions and/or increasing CO2 sequestration (e.g., forest drainage), while other land uses may result in large losses of CO2, CH4, and N2O (e.g., agriculture on organic soils, flooding for hydroelectric generation). Other land uses, such as peatland creation and restoration, produce no net change if they are replacing or restoring a previous level of GHG exchange. These are analogous to reforestation of deforested areas. On closer examination, the inclusion of peatlands in a national greenhouse gas strategy as sinks, despite their large role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, may not significantly reduce net greenhouse gas emissons. If the sinks are to be considered, it is reasonable that terrestrial sources associated with all land uses on peatlands also should be considered. If peatlands are not considered explicitly, but soils in forest and agriculture systems are included in the Kyoto Protocol in the future, then those peatlands impacted by these land uses will be incorporated implicitly.

AB We examined peat from six raised bogs (0-60 cm depth) in northern Lower Saxony, developed from similar Sphagnum species under similar climatic conditions, but differing widely in the actual vegetation and intensity of land use for activity and biomass of soil microorganisms. Two sites were virtually undisturbed, two sites had been converted to grassland and two to woodland. Biomass and activity of soil microorganisms were characterized by the CO2 production rate, substrate-induced respiration (SIR) for biomass C and fumigation-extraction for biomass C and biomass P (FE). Activity and biomass of microorganisms were much greater in the oxic horizons (litter layer, root-felt, earthic peat) than in the anoxic bottom horizons (intermittent and wet peat), and these microbial indices increased also under grassland use compared to fallow and woodland. Biomass C-FE exceeded biomass C-SIR, although both indices were closely correlated (r = 0.84). In the oxic horizons, the ratio of biomass P-to-total P was on average 32%, indicating the importance of microorganisms for the turnover of P in organic soils with very low concentrations of total P.

AB Peatlands on which there is vacuum peat harvesting must be drained to allow peat extraction. Peat erosion due to mechanical filling, vacuum harvest and rain can generate large suspended sediment concentrations that must be reduced before reaching the receiving waters. In this study, six sedimentation basins were monitored over one or two ice-free seasons, resulting in seven basin-years time series, to estimate their trapping efficiency. Using these data, two modelling approaches were first applied to predict the seasonal trapping efficiency of the basins, namely the Brown equation and a multilinear regression model (MLR). Secondly, an additional approach based on the hydrodynamic model MOHID was used to compute the trapping efficiency of one of the basins for a single rain event. The Brown equation, used worldwide in agricultural sedimentation ponds, proved to be less efficient in predicting the trapping efficiency of the basins (r = 0.67, p = 0.1, leave-one-out RMSE = 47.2%) than a MLR model using the volume of the basin, the surface of the harvested catchment and the Von Post decomposition degree of the peat as predictors (r = 0.87, p = 0.01, leave-one-out RMSE = 31.6%). The deterministic MOHID model was capable of reproducing high flow suspended sediment concentration at the basin outlet, based on measured settling velocity distribution of the peat through ViCAs protocol, but requires a good description of the settling velocity distribution across multiple hydrological conditions to simulate the suspended sediment concentrations over a full season in order to compute trapping efficiency. The results presented here provide new insights on eroded peat modelling and could lead to better design formulas for basin conception.

AB The identification of species is essential to ecosystem monitoring and assessment. Remote sensing can provide robust and repeatable spectral measurements that are spatially continuous across ecosystems. Typically, the remote sensing of vegetation has relied on the measurement of leaf spectra, or the measurement of mixed spectra that include leaves, flowers and other components such as stems and soils. This study compares the ability to discriminate between species using pure spectra of leaves and flowers using herbaceous vegetation from a prairie fen as a case study. Spectral data of leaves and flowers were collected from 22 species using a handheld spectroradiometer with a spectral resolution of 1nm from 475nm to 900nm. The use of continuous wavelet transformation was explored to enhance detection of shape in the spectral signatures. Due to the inherent high dimensionality of spectroscopy data, a forward feature selection algorithm was used to identify the best sets of individual bands and continuous wavelet transformed features. The results show that flowers consistently provide better species discrimination in spectral space than leaves in terms of both overall discrimination and efficiency (i.e. consistently requiring fewer features to achieve maximum spectral discrimination). For both transformed leaf and flower spectra, most of the selected features were found to be between 500nm and 600nm, indicating the importance of this region to differentiate between species when measuring both leaves and flowers. These results indicate the potential to map vegetation using the spectra of flowers as the availability of ultra-high-resolution imagery from low-altitude unmanned aerial remote sensing platforms increases.

AB The distribution of two sedge species was studied in two mires which differ in abiotic environments and in distribution of Phragmites australis. Carex lasiocarpa var. occultans dominated in nutrient-poor valley mire, and Carex thunbergii var. appendiculata dominated in nutrient-rich flood plain subject to water fluctuations. Phragmites australis grew well in nutrient-rich conditions. The distribution of C. lasiocarpa showed a strong negative correlation with P. australis coverage, whereas C, thunbergii coverage was not affected by P. australis. The leaf area per dry leaf mass (specific leaf area: SLA) of C. thunbergii increased with shading by P. australis, but that of C, lasiocarpa was stable. The SLA flexibility of C. thunbergii to light interception might enable this species to invade P. australis patches in nutrient-rich environments. The residual nutrient ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus (the ratio of the residual nutrient content at the end of the growing season to peak nutrient content) in the vegetative ramet of C. thunbergii was 1.7 times higher than that of C. lasiocarpa. This low residual ratio may indicate effective nutrient recovery to storage organs. The effective nutrient recovery in C. lasiocarpa might enable this species to grow even in nutrient-poor environments. However, it may be difficult for C. lasiocarpa to expand its habitat to nutrient-rich areas where P, australis dominates as it is not shade tolerant.

AB Mosses are the dominant plants in polar and boreal regions, areas which are experiencing rapid impacts of regional warming. Long-term monitoring programmes provide some records of the rate of recent climate change, but moss peat banks contain an unrivalled temporal record of past climate change on terrestrial plant Antarctic systems. We summarise the current understanding of climatic proxies and determinants of moss growth for contrasting continental and maritime Antarctic regions, as informed by 13C and 18O signals in organic material. Rates of moss accumulation are more than three times higher in the maritime Antarctic than continental Antarctica with growing season length being a critical determinant of growth rate, and high carbon isotope discrimination values reflecting optimal hydration conditions. Correlation plots of 13C and 18O values show that species (Chorisodontium aciphyllum / Polytrichum strictum) and growth form (hummock / bank) are the major determinants of measured isotope ratios. The interplay between moss growth form, photosynthetic physiology, water status and isotope composition are compared with developments of secondary proxies, such as chlorophyll fluorescence. These approaches provide a framework to consider the potential impact of climate change on terrestrial Antarctic habitats as well as having implications for future studies of temperate, boreal and Arctic peatlands. There are many urgent ecological and environmental problems in the Arctic related to mosses in a changing climate, but the geographical ranges of species and life-forms are difficult to track individually. Our goal was to translate what we have learned from the more simple systems in Antarctica, for application to Arctic habitats.

AB The dynamics of organic carbon accumulation in lowland boo soils of Murmansk oblast were assessed by analyzing soil samples from fields formerly sown with perennial grasses but withdrawn from agricultural use three, six, and eight years ago. Within three years, the organic carbon content in the topsoil (0-20 cm) increased by 0.07%, compared to that in cultivated soil. In six- and eight-year-old fallows, the increase in the soil carbon content averaged 0.2 and 0.46%, respectively. Experimental data were used for verifying calculations of carbon turnover in lowland bog soils of fallows in Murmansk oblast by the RothC model.

AB Two localities for Huperzia selago subsp. arctica are recorded from Lithuania, to the south of its known distribution area. The habitats of this subspecies are cutover peatlands whose natural vegetation was disturbed 6-8 years ago during peat exploitation. One of the dominant species of latest vegetation cover is the invasive bryophyte Campylopus introflexus. Characteristics of the habitats of H. selago subsp. arctica and the frequency of this taxon in populations were analysed.

   RECOVERY; QUALITY; TRENDS
AB Understanding fire impacts on peatland vegetation can inform management to support function and prevent degradation of these important ecosystems. However, time since burn, interval between burns and number of past burns all have the potential to modify impacts. Grazing regime may also affect vegetation directly or via an interaction with burning. We used new, comprehensive survey data from a hillslope-scale field experiment initiated in 1954 to investigate the effects of burning and grazing treatments on Sphagnum. Historical data were consulted to aid interpretation of the results. The unburned reference and the most frequently burned (10-year rotation) treatments had greater Sphagnum abundance and hummock height than intermediate treatments (20-year rotation and no-burn since 1954). Abundance of the most common individual species (S. capillifolium, S. subnitens and S. papillosum) followed similar patterns. Light grazing had no impact on Sphagnum-related variables, nor did it interact with the burning treatments. These results suggest that in some cases fire has a negative impact on Sphagnum, and this can persist for several decades. However, fire return interval and other factors such as atmospheric pollution may alter effects, and in some cases Sphagnum abundance may recover. Fire severity and site specific conditions may also influence effects, so we advise consideration of these factors, and caution when using fire as a management tool on peatlands where Sphagnum is considered desirable.

AB In the absence of management and with sustained non-point source pollution, the diversity of European low productive herbaceous vegetation is under threat. In many cases dominant grasses exclude other species. Molinia caerulea is such a potential dominant species. In a Campine rich fen near Mol, aerial photos show progressive invasion by M. caerulea tussocks. Marginal zones are completely closed by M. caerulea, while in ground water discharge zones open low growing vegetation persists mixed with small M. caerulea tussocks or non-tussock individuals. During the tussock development process, M. caerulea shows a preference for the slightly drier marginal sites, contrary to the wettest ground-water discharge flushes where it is present as non-tussock individual shoots. This contrast was used to make a comparative study between zones and growth form of M. caerulea and its relation with neighbouring species. We investigate the hypothesis that differential M caerulea performance is caused by differences in nutrient availability. Biomass and nutrient concentrations of M . caerulea shoots were investigated in relation to their location (marginal I ground-water discharge) and in relation to their growth form (spread non-tussock individual shoots / tussock shoots). M. caerulea shoots from marginal sites grew larger than shoots from central sites and tussock shoots proved superior to individual shoots. From the nutrient concentrations and the known P-limitation of the site, it is concluded that the P-availability is responsible. It appears that M. caerulea tussocks set up an efficient retranslocation of P. The mechanism is also present in non-tussock individuals, where it proved more efficient in the marginal sites. The biomass and N- and P concentration in M. caerulea leaves from non-tussock individuals and tussocks of increasing height in the ground-water discharge sites were investigated. June leaf P-concentrations, were unexpectedly low in shoots from small (10-30 cm) tussocks as compared to non-tussock shoots. This invalidates a straightforward relation between P-availability and M. caerulea development in the wettest sites. Possible explanations are discussed. Overall the set-up of an efficient retranslocation of P seems crucial in the development of M. caerulea dominance in this type of fens.

AB Tomasz Mieczan (2009) Ciliates in Sphagnum peatlands: vertical micro-distribution, and relationships of species assemblages with environmental parameters. Zoological Studies 48(1): 33-48. The distribution of ciliates living among different species of mosses (Sphagnum angustifolium, S. cuspidatum, S. flexuosum, S. magellanicum, Polytrichum strictum, and P. commune) in eastern Poland Sphagnum peatlands is described. The highest species richness (23-35 taxa) occurred in hollows dominated by S. angustifolium, S. flexuosum, and S. palustre. Decidedly lower numbers of taxa (7-10) were observed in hummocks dominated by S. magellanicum and Polytrichum. The greatest abundance of ciliates was found in micro-sites dominated by S. flexuosum (25-30 individuals (ind./g), while the lowest was found in sites dominated by Polytrichum (4-6 ind./g). Likewise, independent of the species of mosses, micro-vertical differentiation of these protozoa was found. The number of species and abundance significantly increased at the deepest sampling depth. The upper sampling of mosses (0-5 cm) was dominated by mixotrophic taxa, whereas the deeper sampling level (5-10 cm) showed increases in the proportions of bacterivore species. In peatlands, the factors limiting the occurrence of ciliates are physical and chemical suitability - mainly the total organic carbon content and depth of water table (DWT), but also somewhat lower levels of pH and the species of moss. In turn, an increase in pH also increased the role of nutrients. Such factors have a significant effect on the occurrence of ciliates, The abundances of ciliates in spring and autumn were positively correlated with the concentration of organic matter independent of the species of moss; however, in summer, the influence of pH and DWT increased. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.1/33.pdf

AB Peat-based and peat-free (compost) materials were tested in a vegetable forcing experiment with Danubia green pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). Stability and quality of humic substances and the turnover of different nitrogen forms was determined in the studied media during the vegetation period. The main objective was to find how the degree of humification might influence the productivity of a crop under greenhouse conditions. The highest humus stability and humus stability coefficient values were detected in the green waste compost. Among different peat media, the low-moor peat was more humificated than the mixture of low-moor and high-moor peat. When the medium is more humificated it has a larger mobile nitrogen reserve. However, the structure stability decreases with the increasing humification. The mixture of two types of peat had the most favourable effect on nitrogen supply and the yield of pepper was the highest when grown on this medium. The nitrogen supplying ability of the examined compost was excellent but its structure stability deteriorated during the growing season.

ID BLANKET PEAT; WATER; WETLANDS; DYNAMICS; DRAINAGE; CHINA
AB Zoige Peatland in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the largest alpine peatland in China, was widely ditched in 1970s for pasture expansion. The ditching is believed to have caused peatland degradation, but there is still no widespread agreement on this due to the absence of essential regional and temporal information about ditch drainage. Therefore, this study used both remote-sensing observations and field surveys to examine the ecological influences of ditching for this alpine peatland. In the study, ditch distribution was interpreted with remote-sensing imagery and the ecological responses were investigated with temporal observation by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and field surveys. The results showed that there were similar to 1200 km ditches interpreted, mainly in three spatial patterns depending on hydro-geomorphologies. The MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was more sensitive to peatland surface water depth (R-2 = 0.678, P < 0.001) than the normalized difference water index (NDWI) (R-2 = 0.583, P < 0.001), because the latter would become saturated at a certain surface water depth (similar to 50 cm in Zoige). The temporal MODIS imagery reflected the ecological responses of ditched peatland to drainage in terms of vegetation density and water conditions. This study indicated that ditching depressed the surface water depth of the Zoige Peatland in summer, but not to the extent of completely transforming peatland into steppe due to the recharging of local beneficial hydro-geomorphologies. The MODIS indices investigated in the study could be used to monitor the annual regional status of vegetation cover and surface water for Zoige peatland.

AB Peatland ecosystems contain one-third of the world's soil carbon store and many have been exposed to drought leading to a loss of carbon. Understanding biogeochemical mechanisms affecting decomposition in peatlands is essential for improving resilience of ecosystem function to predicted climate change. We investigated biogeochemical changes along a chronosequence of hydrological restoration (dry eroded gully, drain-blocked < 2 years, drain blocked < 7 years and wet pristine site), and examined whether hydrological legacy alters the response of beta-glucosidase kinetics (i.e. type of inhibition) to short-term drying and waterlogging. In the dry eroded gully at depth, low phenolic concentrations were associated with enhanced beta-glucosidase enzyme activities (V-max) but short-term drying and waterlogging caused a significant increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phenolics associated with increases in Vmax (enzyme production) and Km (indicative of competitive inhibition). Inhibition within the drain blocked and pristine sites at depth exhibited non-competitive inhibition (decreased Vmax), whilst uncompetitive inhibition (decreased Vmax and Km) occurred in surface peat explained by variation in humic substances and phenolics. These results suggest that loss of carbon by short-term drought or rewetting may occur from sites with a legacy of drought due to the release of non-inhibitory phenolics that permits enhanced enzyme activity.

AB Two peat columns from Tunguska (Siberia) were analysed for pollen, spores, charcoal, trace elements and gamma-emitters in order to identify the fingerprints of the impact of a still unidentified cosmic body (TCB), which occurred in the summer of 1908, and the level of environmental pollution in a background area of central Siberia. Peat layers were subject to non-destructive gamma-ray spectrometry to derive radiochronology by the excess Pb-210 method. The age-to-depth relationship was crosschecked by using both 1963 horizon of Cs-137 associated to maximum global fallout deposition and palynological data profiles. Vertical distributions of trace elements in the peat columns were obtained by PIXE multielemental analysis allowing determination of the levels of environmental contamination in a background region of the Siberian taiga.
   The association of heavy metals such as Ni, Co and Cu in the profiles suggests the connection of the area with mining and metal smelting activity in the north of the region through atmospheric circulation. As concerns global scale contamination, the inventory of the artificial radionuclide Cs-137 (4.6 kBq m(-2)) shows a value typical of remote slightly contaminated areas resulting from global scale redistribution of radioactive fallout from Cold War nuclear weapon testing. The atmospheric inventory of the natural radionuclide Pb-210, for which a mean annual flux of 200 Bq m(-2) yr(-1) has been calculated, is typical of continental regions.
   The influence of Tunguska Cosmic Body in the peat is recognizable by a large discontinuity in the palynological profile of the peat monolith at a depth coinciding with the 1908 layer as determined by the Pb-210 technique, showing a large peak of total pollen counting attributed to the impact of the shockwave on the area in which huge tree stands were destroyed. Following the event, tree pollen concentration decreases abruptly showing the temporary inception of a mire environment with an increase of Sphagnum spore concentrations. Results of elemental analysis so far available do not show anomalies in the concentration profiles at depths coinciding with the Tunguska event layer indicating the need for pre-concentration technique enabling the detection of element associations typical of extraterrestrial materials.

AB In this study, we propose a method to create a Sphagnum wetland in an urban ecosystem by collecting basic information about Sphagnum growth and decomposition. We constructed six groups of Sphagnum microcosms (1 m x 1 m) with three replicates. A factorial design with two planting methods (capitulum without stem and capitulum with stem) and three levels of nitrogen addition (0, 2, and 6 g N m(-2) year(-1)) were prepared. Changes in length, dry mass, and decomposition rates of Sphagnum were monitored over a growing season. The effect of N concentration on production varied for the different planting methods. Production of Sphagnum increased with N concentration in the capitulum without the stem treatment (-D) than in the with stem treatment (+D). Adding N affected the decomposition rate in both with and without stem treatments. Decomposition rate increased with added nitrogen. Planting without stems (-D) was an effective design for a high production and low decomposition of Sphagnum. Net primary production was 187-260 g m(-2) year(-1) for dry mass and 15.5-26.5 mm year(-1) for length, whereas decomposition rates were 10.9-14.7 % mass loss per year. These values are comparable to those from natural bogs. The overall results indicate that constructing Sphagnum wetlands can be successfully employed as a greening technology in urban ecosystems, even in mid-latitudes.

AB [1] We report on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measurements conducted with the eddy covariance method over agricultural peat soil in the 2-year period between October 2000 and October 2002. In 2001, spring barley and undersown grass were sown on the site. After the barley harvest, the perennial forage grass was left to grow, so that in 2002 the field was growing grass. A higher maximum net CO2 uptake was observed for barley than for grass during the height of the summer, peaking at about -1.0 and - 0.75 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The maximum nighttime total ecosystem respiration was measured in July and was similar for both crops, about 0.35 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). During the growing season the field acted as a daily CO2 sink for only 40 days in barley versus 84 days in grass. In the winter the average carbon dioxide efflux varied from 15.6 to 16.5 mug CO2 m(-2) s(-1). The annual NEE of the agricultural peat soil growing barley and grass was 771 +/- 104 and 290 +/- 91 g CO2 m(-2), respectively. The longer net CO2 uptake period was the main reason for the lower annual NEE for grass; however, owing to the higher amount of grass biomass produced the net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated as the sum of NEE and removed biomass, was slightly larger for grass (452 g C m(-2)) than for barley (336 g C m(-2)). These results show that the organic peat is still undergoing rapid decomposition after more than 100 years of cultivation activity. In addition, switching from an annual to a perennial crop did not turn the field into a CO2 sink, at least during a 1-year period.

AB Water is one of the most important environmental factors defining the niche of terrestrial fungi, and fungi preserved in ombrotrophic peat deposits have the potential to indicate past variations in surface wetness and vegetation composition. This study aimed to assess the potential of fungal microfossils for palaeoclimate reconstructions. The environmental preferences of fungi were evaluated by assessing the relationships among fungal types, the peat-forming vegetation, the occurrence of fire, and water table status in fossil and modem samples from two raised bogs in northern England and Denmark.
   The microfungi which showed consistent patterns among the three datasets examined in the study were generally indicators of relatively dry (hummock-like) conditions, and the abundance of most of the abundant fungal types observed reflected the prevalent vegetation type more than the direct influence of local moisture conditions. A number of fungal microfossils were identified which can be used to consistently provide a qualitative reconstruction of past conditions on the surface of the bog, and accurately indicate shifts between relatively dry and wet local conditions. Spores, in general, provided more information about local moisture conditions than vegetative mycelia. Some of the more abundant types, particularly Type 12 spores, showed a characteristic distribution with water table depth, which was consistent between the two different sites examined in the study. These fungal types can form the basis of future quantitative reconstructions of past water table and therefore climate in ombrotrophic bogs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examined aerobic and anaerobic microbial carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange in peat samples representing different profiles at natural, mined, mined-abandoned, and restored northern peatlands and characterized the nutrient and substrate chemistry and microbial biomass of these soils. Mining and abandonment led to reduced nutrient and substrate availability and occasionally drier conditions in surface peat resulting in a drastic reduction in CO2 and CH4 production, in agreement with previous studies. Owing mainly to wetter conditions, CH4 production and oxidation were faster in restored block-cut than natural sites, whereas in one restored site, increased substrate and nutrient availability led to much more rapid rates of CO2 production. Our work in restored block-cut sites compliments that in vacuum-harvested peatlands undergoing more recent active restoration attempts. The sites we examined covered a large range of soil C substrate quality, nutrient availability, microbial biomass, and microbial activities, allowing us to draw general conclusions about controls on microbial CO2 and CH4 dynamics using stepwise regression analysis among all sites and soil depths. Aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of peat was constrained by organic matter quality, particularly phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) chemistry, and closely linked to the size of the microbial biomass supported by these limiting resources. Methane production was more dominantly controlled by field moisture content (a proxy for anaerobism), even after 20 days of anaerobic laboratory incubation, and to a lesser extent by C substrate availability. As methanogens likely represented only a small proportion of the total microbial biomass, there were no links between total microbial biomass and CH4 production. Methane oxidation was controlled by the same factors influencing CH4 production, leading to the conclusion that CH4 oxidation is primarily controlled by substrate (that is, CH4) availability. Although restoring hydrology similar to natural sites may re-establish CH4 dynamics, there is geographic or site-specific variability in the ability to restore peat decomposition dynamics.

AB Pb-210 chronologies and depth profiles of stable S isotope ratios (deltaS-34) and concentrations of organic and inorganic S fractions were determined in peat cores from nine sites in the U.S. and the Czech Republic. Results indicate that depth profiles in S concentrations, S accumulation, and deltaS-34 ratios in peat deposits are affected not only by historical patterns in atmospheric S deposition but also by ongoing depth-dependent changes in S reduction-oxidation and S immobilization-mineralization processes within a peat deposit. These processes impart a certain degree of mobility to S in peat, bringing into question the validity of reconstructing historical records of S accumulation using dated peat profiles. Over long-term diagenesis, isotopically light S may be continually released from deep peat. This release may result in redistribution of S and S isotopes in peat and suggests that short-term patterns in S accumulation may not persist over much longer time scales.

AB In the boreal and temperate zones about 15 million hectares of peatlands and wetlands have been drained for forestry purposes and a large number of these forests are now approaching their commercial thinning or regeneration age. One of the major concerns raised in connection with an increased harvesting of drained peatland forests is the deterioration of the downstream water quality due to an enhanced nutrient transport. Harvest residues left on the site are a potential high source of nutrients to recipient water bodies and both increased N and P exports have been reported after conventional stem-only clear-cutting. We studied the decomposition of Picea abies and Pin us sylvestris harvest residue needles at two clear-cut areas and two uncut forested areas on drained peatlands at two locations in southern Finland. Our results indicated that P is easily released from harvest residue needles. After the first three growing seasons, spruce and pine needles had lost approximately 31% and 47% of their initial P contents, respectively. There was no clear gain or loss of nitrogen. Most of the heavy metals accumulated in the needles as the decomposition process proceeded, especially at the more southern study location near the heavily industrialized Helsinki capital area with high atmospheric deposition. The conclusion is that harvest residue needles are not a likely source of the increased N export that has been observed to occur from peat soils soon after clear-cutting, but that P release from harvest residues may be a cause for the reported high P losses.

AB Reactive iron and organic carbon are intimately associated in soils and sediments. However, to date, the organic compounds involved are uncharacterized on the molecular level. At redox interfaces in peatlands, where the biogeochemical cycles of iron and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are coupled, this issue can readily be studied. We found that precipitation of iron hydroxides at the oxic surface layer of two rewetted fens removed a large fraction of DOM via coagulation. On aeration of anoxic fen pore waters, >90% of dissolved iron and 27 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD) of dissolved organic carbon were rapidly (within 24 h) removed. Using ultra-high-resolution MS, we show that vascular plant-derived aromatic and pyrogenic compounds were preferentially retained, whereas the majority of carboxyl-rich aliphatic acids remained in solution. We propose that redox interfaces, which are ubiquitous in marine and terrestrial settings, are selective yet intermediate barriers that limit the flux of land-derived DOM to oceanic waters.

AB This long-term study (23 yr) aims at specifying the characteristic features of secondary progressive successions in abandoned wet eutrophic grasslands as a precondition for better understanding causal relationships and improving the predictability of successions on such habitats The vegetation of inundated fen grasslands (Calthion) at the lower course of the river Wumme near Bremen (Northwest Germany) was studied annually on three permanent plots (each 10 x 10 m(2)) where hay making had ceased in 1983, 1985 and 1992, respectively In the initial succession phase of three to five years a fast increase of tall-growing, rhizomatous, deciduous reed species (e g Phalaris arundinacea) occurred This strongly changed vegetation structure and within-canopy light climate, which was the reason for the strong decrease in species diversity Rhizomes are hypothesized to be a key factor of high competitiveness in abandoned wet grasslands because this organ combines multiple advantageous functions low-risk vegetative propagation, nutrient storage and nutrient re-allocation between above- and below-ground plant organs, all these functions allowing for a gradual build-up of a high biomass Extinct grassland species (e g Senecio aquaticus) represent a contrasting set of plant traits such as small stature, short lifespan, prevailing generative reproduction and evergreen leaves. The subsequent succession phase commencing about five years after mowing was ceased was characterized by persistence of the established reed vegetation, which prevented tree colonisation until today. Secondary successions in abandoned wet eutrophic grasslands can be predicted on the level of plant communities and functional species groups considering changes in the habitat (esp. light climate), the presence of reed species with a specific set of plant traits in the "Initial Floristic Composition" and their potentially high competitive vigour.

AB Peatlands are a particularly good medium for trapping and preserving tephra, as their surfaces are wet and well vegetated. The extent of tephra-depositing events can often be greatly expanded through the observation of ash in peatlands. This paper uses the presence of the White River tephra layer (1200 B.P.) in peatlands to extend the known distribution of this late Holocene tephra into the Mackenzie Valley, northwestern Canada. The ash has been noted almost to the western shore of Great Slave Lake, over 1300 km from the source in southeastern Alaska. This new distribution covers approximately 540 000 km(2) with a tephra volume of 27 km(3). The short time span and constrained timing of volcanic ash deposition, combined with unique physical and chemical parameters, make tephra layers ideal for use as chronostratigraphic markers.

AB A 650 cm core from a Swiss bog represents 12,370 C-14 years of peat accumulation and provides the first complete record of atmospheric Pb deposition for the entire Holocene. Excess, non-atmospheric Sr in the peat was calculated by normalizing Sr/Sc to crustal abundance; this was used to differentiate between the ombrogenic section of the bog in which inorganic solids are supplied exclusively by atmospheric deposition and the minerogenic zone where mineral-water interactions contribute metals to the peat. While sediment dissolution contributes significantly to the Sr inventory of the minerogenic section of the peat profile, there is no measurable effect of this process on the Ph burden. Isotopic analyses (Pb-204, Pb-206, Pb-207, Pb-208) show that effectively all of the Pb in the peat profile was supplied exclusively from the atmosphere. To separate natural and anthropogenic Pb, Sc was selected over Ti, Y, Zr, Hf and REE as a conservative, reference element which is supplied by soil dust aerosols derived from rock weathering. Enrichment factors (EF) were calculated using the Pb/Sc ratio in the peat samples, normalized to the "natural, background" Pb/Sc which is found in peats dating from 8030 to 5320 C-14 yr BP. The results show that anthropogenic source have dominated the supply of atmospheric Pb to the peat core continuously since 3000 C-14 yr BP. The aerosols supplied to the bog can be divided into 3 classes: a) Pre-Anthropogenic (older than 3000 C-14 yr BP with Pb EF < 2 and Pb-206/Pb-207 > 1.194); b) Pre-Industrial (dating from 3000-240 C-14 yr BP, with Pb EF greater than or equal to 2 but < 20 and Pb-206/Pb-207 1.193-1.179); c) Industrial (more recent than 240 C-14 yr BP, with Pb EF > 20 and Pb-206/Pb-207 < 1.179). Elevated soil dust fluxes are observed at 5320, 8230 and 10,590 C-14 yr BP; the latter corresponds to the Younger Dryas. Aluminum, Zr, Hf, and REE/Sc ratios also are elevated at the same depths, suggesting differences in particle size, wind strength, or source regions. Pre-Anthropogenic aerosols deposited since 8230 C-14 yr BP reveal Pb/Sc which is significantly higher, and Pb-206/Pb-207 which is less radiogenic, than during the early Holocene. While the trend toward increasing Pb/Sc could be due to chemical weathering and soil development, this could not explain the shift in Pb isotopic composition. The changes which took place at 8230 C-14 BP, therefore, may be related to a large scale climatic reorganization which, at present, is poorly understood. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Hummock-hollow microtopography is common in the northern peatlands of the world, but its effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) components are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated effects of microtopography on SOC stocks and soil labile organic carbon (LOC) fractions in a sedge peatland in Changbai Mountain in northeast China. We found that SOC and soil LOC fractions had much heterogeneity in microtopography. SOC concentration in hummocks was significantly higher than under hummocks and in hollows. On average, the total SOC stock to a depth of 0.3 m below the ground surface was 19.00 kg C/m(2). Fifty six percent of the total SOC stock was stored in soils in and under hummocks, despite the hummock only covering 30% of the total area. Light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in hummocks were significantly higher than under hummocks and in hollows. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified that SOC explained most variations in soil LOC fractions (59.6%), followed by soil total phosphorus (7.4%) and soil water content (6.6%). Our findings indicate that the hummock is an important carbon pool in the sedge peatland. Hummock-hollow microtopography creates heterogeneity in hydrological conditions and soil physicochemical properties, and thus influences SOC stocks and soil LOC fractions at a small scale. This study highlights the importance of microtopography in carbon storage and cycling and has direct implications for the assessment of the carbon sequestration function in northern peatlands.

AB Producer-decomposer interactions within aquatic biofilms can range from mutualistic associations to competition depending on available resources. The outcomes of such interactions have implications for biogeochemical cycling and, as such, may be especially important in northern peatlands, which are a global carbon sink and are expected to experience changes in resource availability with climate change. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nutrients and organic carbon on the relative proportion of primary producers (microalgae) and heterotrophic decomposers (bacteria and fungi) during aquatic biofilm development in a boreal peatland. Given that decomposers are often better competitors for nutrients than primary producers in aquatic ecosystems, we predicted that labile carbon subsidies would shift the biofilm composition towards heterotrophy owing to the ability of decomposers to outcompete primary producers for available nutrients in the absence of carbon limitation.
   We manipulated nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) and organic carbon (glucose) in a full factorial design using nutrient-diffusing substrates in an Alaskan fen.
   Heterotrophic bacteria were limited by organic carbon and algae were limited by inorganic nutrients. However, the outcomes of competitive interactions depended on background nutrient levels. Heterotrophic bacteria were able to outcompete algae for available nutrients when organic carbon was elevated and nutrient levels remained low, but not when organic carbon and nutrients were both elevated through enrichment.
   Fungal biomass was significantly lower in the presence of glucose alone, possibly owing to antagonistic interactions with heterotrophic bacteria. In contrast to bacteria, fungi were stimulated along with algae following nutrient enrichment.
   The decoupling of algae and heterotrophic bacteria in the presence of glucose alone shifted the biofilm trophic status towards heterotrophy. This effect was overturned when nutrients were enriched along with glucose, owing to a subsequent increase in algal biomass in the absence of nutrient limitation.
   By measuring individual components of the biofilm and obtaining data on the trophic status, we have begun to establish a link between resource availability and biofilm formation in northern peatlands. Our results show that labile carbon subsidies from outside sources have the potential to disrupt microbial coupling and shift the metabolic balance in favour of heterotrophy. The extent to which this occurs in the future will probably depend on the timing and composition of bioavailable nutrients delivered to surface waters with environmental change (e.g. permafrost thaw).

AB Long-term plant community dynamics has been investigated by analyses of macro- and microfossil remains found in unconsolidated limnic and terrestrial sediments, chiefly of Late-Quaternary and Recent age. Plant macrofossils preserved in packrat (Neotoma) midden sites in semi-arid regions have yielded the most informative data for the period between the lastest glacial to the present day. The remains can, with few exceptions, be identified to species level, they represent a large (> 75%) proportion of the species composition of vegetation within a radius of 30-50 m of a site, and they can be dated by the accelerator mass-spectrometric radiocarbon method. Most sites have been found in the arid southwest of the United States and significant contributions have been made recently to understanding of long-term changes in species composition and shifts in range and elevational limits of species. Similarly, analysis of macrofossils in lake, mire and river sites can draw on the taxonomic precision, small source area and potential for precise radiocarbon dating of samples, to provide detailed reconstructions of the local vegetation of lacustrine, mire and fluvial habitats. The vast literature reporting these investigations deals with sites chiefly in northern temperate regions, but recent studies from tropical and warm-temperate regions show the promise of the approach. The use of analyses of microscopic charcoal preserved in sediments has increased significantly in the past few decades as part of attempts to reconstruct forest fire history and, when combined with other analyses (pollen, physical chemistry), to investigate past community dynamics. The major limitations of the method are poor chronological control in many sediments, uncertainties about source area and limited taxonomic precision. On the other hand, macroscopic remains of charcoal can usually be identified to species level, can be dated accurately and have readily defined source areas. However, sites with high frequencies of sample occurrence spanning long, continuous time intervals are very rare, as a remarkable example from the humid tropics of Africa illustrates. Pollen analysis of lake and mire sediments has a long history and has yielded a vast literature. Its weaknesses as a tool in the three main fields of interest where it is used - palaeoclimatology, cultural history and plant community dynamics - are well known and increase in regions farther north and south of the boreal and temperate regions, as the frequency of anemophily declines among the major elements of the terrestrial plant communities. The most promising developments in pollen analysis as applied to community dynamics are in small, within-canopy sites in forested regions, and small (< 5 ha) lakes with fine-scale temporal resolution.

AB A critical gap in the understanding of the global cycling of mercury is the limited data describing the natural background atmospheric deposition rate of mercury before the advent of pollution. Existing estimates of the natural deposition rate are typically about 2-5 mug of Hg m(-2) year(-1) (see, for example, Swain et al. Science 1992, 257, 784-787), based on studies that generally rely on short, Pb-210-dated lake sediment and peat cores that span the past 150 years. Analyses of mercury in long peat cores in southcentral Sweden indicate that natural mercury deposition rates in the period 4000-500 BP were lower, about 0.5-1 mug of Hg m(-2) year(-1). This suggests that recent mercury accumulation rates in the peat (15-25 mug of Hg m(-2) year(-1)) and measured atmospheric deposition rates of mercury in Sweden over the past 3 decades (5-30 mug of Hg m(-2) year(-1)) (Munthe et al. Water, Air, Soil Pollut: Focus 2001, 1, 299-310) are at least an order of magnitude greater than the prepollution deposition rate, rather than representing only a 3-5-fold increase, as has generally been estimated.

The results of these two methods have been compared and variations of the delta C-13 value show a clear relationship with the pollen percentages of tree taxa, such as Carpinus, Fagus, Picea, and Anus as well as with spores of Sphagnum and akinetes of Cyanophyta. However, lags of up to similar to 200 years of pollen maxima and minima versus delta C-13 were observed. The delta C-13 value in the peat core varied between -23.47 and -27.58%. and is interpreted here as reflecting temperature control of the carbon isotope composition of the peat. According to this interpretation and pollen analysis of the study area, the following climatic periods for the Holocene can be described: Atlantic-beginning warm (8.50-7.90 ka cal. BP) followed by moderated cold (7.90-5.75 ka cal. BP), Subboreal-beginning moderated cold (5.75-5.40 ka cal. BP) then warm (5.40-2.55 ka cal. BP), Subatlantic-beginning warm (2.55-2.20 ka cal. BP) then cold and moderate cold (2.20 ka-0.40 ka cal. BP) with a climatic minimum similar to 1.60 ka cal. BP. The highest relative difference between growing season temperatures was about 3.6 degrees C, which has been observed between the Subboreal temperature maximum (5.00 ka cal. BP) and the Subatlantic temperature minimum (1.60 ka cal. BP). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article is a sequel to a word-model description of the ecosystem of sub-Antarctic Marion Island, published in this journal 30 years ago (Smith 1977). It expands on the qualitative considerations of patterns of energy flow and nutrient cycling presented in that paper, by providing quantitative information from subsequent research at the island. Primary production of the island's lowland plant communities is high on an annual basis, because the vegetation has a long growing season due to the lack of severely cold winters or drought. Daily productivity is actually low due to low radiation levels and a cool growing season. The vegetation is particularly efficient regarding its use of nutrients for its growth, but still requires substantial amounts of nutrients to support the high annual production. Seabirds and seals import large quantities of nutrients from the ocean when they breed and moult on the island. They markedly enhance soil and plant nutrient status in the areas in which they occur, and also in adjacent areas. However, by far the greater part of the island's inland vegetation is not directly influenced by birds or seals and most of the nutrients required for plant growth are provided by decomposition of plant litter and peat. Soil invertebrates are crucial facilitators of decomposition processes, which are otherwise restricted by low soil temperatures and high soil moisture contents. Introduced house mice have invaded almost all parts of the island and predate heavily on the invertebrates, thus affecting nutrient mineralisation. This threatens not only the functioning (lowered nutrient availability leading to slower plant growth and the production of a lower quality, more decomposition-recalcitrant plant litter), but also the structure (an altered balance between production and decomposition leads to a change in the relation between peat formation and degradation, which is an important determinant of vegetation succession) of the island's ecosystem. It is suggested that mice may also affect the island's ecology by predating on seabird chicks.

TI Fire and vegetation in a temperate peat bog: Implications for the

   DYNAMICS; PLANTS
AB Fire plays an important role in structuring wetland ecosystems, but previous studies of New Zealand wetlands have lacked adequate experimental controls. We investigated the effects of fire on the vegetation of a New Zealand peat bog through analysis of microclimate patterns, vegetation change, and peat stratigraphy. We focused on the role of fire in sustaining threatened plant species such as the critically endangered orchid Corybas carsei. Experimental fire significantly increased the surface radiation and daytime soil temperature, and these elevated levels of radiation and temperature persisted 53 months after burning. Immediately after fire no living plant material remained in the burn plots, but within 2 months many of the rhizomatous species were resprouting and 50 months later had returned to prefire abundance. Obligate-seeding species did not recover their former abundance, but several species not observed in the plots prior to the burns established after fire. Species richness, diversity, and evenness increased following fire but declined in the control plots. Species dominance decreased after fire but increased in the control plots. C. carsei , which was killed during the fire, reappeared in the burn plots 1 year later at a higher density than prior to burning and was still present 4 years after fire. C. carsei flowering was also enhanced following the fire. We found evidence of historical fires, which was supported by radiocarbon dates from a much older adjacent wetland. Our results suggest that disturbances such as fire are important for maintaining a diversity of plant communities, including the presence of nationally threatened and declining plant species in peat bogs. Without such disturbances species such as C. carsei are likely to become locally extinct.

AB Historically, slow decomposition rates have resulted in the accumulation of large amounts of carbon in northern peatlands. Both climate warming and vegetation change can alter rates of decomposition, and hence affect rates of atmospheric CO2 exchange, with consequences for climate change feedbacks. Although warming and vegetation change are happening concurrently, little is known about their relative and interactive effects on decomposition processes. To test the effects of warming and vegetation change on decomposition rates, we placed litter of three dominant species (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum, Hypnum jutlandicum) into a peatland field experiment that combined warming with plant functional group removals, and measured mass loss over two years. To identify potential mechanisms behind effects, we also measured nutrient cycling and soil biota. We found that plant functional group removals exerted a stronger control over short-term litter decomposition than did similar to 1 degrees C warming, and that the plant removal effect depended on litter species identity. Specifically, rates of litter decomposition were faster when shrubs were removed from the plant community, and these effects were strongest for graminoid and bryophyte litter. Plant functional group removals also had strong effects on soil biota and nutrient cycling associated with decomposition, whereby shrub removal had cascading effects on soil fungal community composition, increased enchytraeid abundance, and increased rates of N mineralization. Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to litter quality, changes in vegetation composition play a significant role in regulating short-teem litter decomposition and belowground communities in peatland, and that these impacts can be greater than moderate warming effects. Our findings, albeit from a relatively short-term study, highlight the need to consider both vegetation change and its impacts below ground alongside climatic effects when predicting future decomposition rates and carbon storage in peatlands.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze and model how biomass is allocated to the leaves, stems, and roots of perennial grass (reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinacea L., hereafter RCG) under elevated temperature (ET) (+approx. 3 A degrees C) and CO2 (approx. 700 mu mol mol(-1)) and with variable groundwater levels (high to low water levels) in a boreal environment. For this purpose, RCG plants were grown in environmentally controlled chambers over two growing seasons (April-September of 2009 and 2010), and the plant organ biomass (leaves, stems, and roots) was measured seven times over the entire growing season. The results showed that biomass production was mainly allocated to the leaves (LMF) and stems (SMF) early in the growing season, to the stems in the middle of the growing season, and to the roots (RMF) later in the growing season. Compared to ambient conditions, ET treatments increased LMF and SMF, and decreased RMF over the growing season under well-water conditions. Under low groundwater level, ET treatments decreased LMF and increased RMF throughout the growing season, and increased SMF in early periods and then decreased later in the growing season. CO2 enrichment did not significantly affect the seasonal allocation pattern between plant organs. The effect of the groundwater level on biomass allocation was stronger than that of the climatic treatments. In conclusion, plant phenology controlled the seasonal course of biomass allocation in RCG and climatic treatments affected biomass allocation to each of the three plant organs, while the direction and extent of climate-related changes in biomass allocation depended on the availability of groundwater. The influence of groundwater level appeared to be crucial for the carbon gain regarding the production of RCG biomass for energy purpose and the concurrent sequestration of carbon in soils under changing climate in the mire sites used to cultivate RCG.

AB The mid-Holocene eruption of Aniakchak volcano (Aniakchak II) in southwest Alaska was among the largest eruptions globally in the last 10,000 years (VEI-6). Despite evidence for possible impacts on global climate, the precise age of the eruption is not well-constrained and little is known about regional environmental impacts. A closely spaced sequence of radiocarbon dates at a peatland site over 1000 km from the volcano show that peat accumulation was greatly reduced with a hiatus of approximately 90-120 yr following tephra deposition. During this inferred hiatus no paleoenvironmental data are available but once vegetation returned the flora changed from a Cyperaceae-dominated assemblage to a Poaceae-dominated vegetation cover, suggesting a drier and/or more nutrient-rich ecosystem. Oribatid mites are extremely abundant in the peat at the depth of the ash, and show a longer-term, increasingly wet peat surface across the tephra layer. The radiocarbon sample immediately below the tephra gave a date of 1636-1446 cal yr BC suggesting that the eruption might be younger than previously thought Our findings suggest that the eruption may have led to a widespread reduction in peatland carbon sequestration and that the impacts on ecosystem functioning were profound and long-lasting.

AB The dependence of the spectral reflectance (averaged over an area of approximately 0.023 ha) of peat and degraded peat soils of Polesye on the soil organic carbon content has been investigated under actual field conditions for the first time. The dependence is approximated by exponential and power functions, and the confidence intervals are explicitly calculated for each parameter of the approximating functions. The parameter values for the exponential function appear better validated than the parameter values for the power function, since the corresponding confidence intervals for the former are much narrower. The values of AIC and BIC information criteria show that the power model gives a better description of experimental data for bands 1 and 2, and the exponential model gives a better description for the 3N band of the ASTER spectroradiometer.

AB Based on the data of long-term studies of bog and river waters in the taiga zone of Western Siberia, highly significant linear regression models for the relationships between the organic matter content and optical density of the water were developed. The parameters of the relationships obtained are proposed to be used for the determination of the water-soluble carbon content. The inclusion only of the optical density values into the calculated formulas makes them convenient for practical application. Regression models were developed on the basis of the data on determining the carbon content using the bichromate method, which is widely used in soil and hydrochemical studies. The calculated method forms prerequisites for the operational monitoring of the water-soluble organic substances, since the obtained results can be comparable with the earlier published data on the carbon content determined by the same method. These regression models seem to also be suitable for the determination of the organic carbon in the water extracts of organic soils.

AB Boreal black spruce forests typically have a dense ground cover of bryophytes. The two main bryophyte groups in boreal black spruce forests, feathermoss and Sphagnum, have ecophysiological characteristics that influence the biogeochemical cycles of black spruce forests differently. The objective of this study was to examine the environmental controls of ground cover composition and net primary production (NPP) of feathermoss and Sphagnum in a boreal black spruce forest in central Saskatchewan. The fraction of Sphagnum ground cover was positively correlated to canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittance (r(2)=0.48, P=0.03), but the fraction of feathermoss ground cover was negatively correlated to canopy PAR transmittance in plots where Sphagnum was present (r(2)=0.87, P <0.0001). Sphagnum presence was inversely correlated (P=0.0001) to water table index, defined as water table depth relative to the peat layer, while feathermoss occurred in a wider range of microenvironments. Average NPP for 1998 was more than three times greater for Sphagnum (77 g C m(-2) year(-1)) than feathermoss (24 g C m(-2) year(-1)), but the average bryophyte NPP for 1998 was 25 g C m(-2) year(-1) because feathermoss was the dominant ground cover. The large, but differing, peat carbon content of Sphagnum- versus feathermoss-dominated boreal forests and peatlands necessitates the need to accurately quantify fraction ground cover. Additional validation of the empirical models between environmental variables and fraction ground cover of bryophytes is necessary, but the reported relationships offer an approach to model carbon dynamics of bryophytes in boreal forests and peatlands.

AB Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured in a patterned peatland with eddy covariance (EC) and chamber methods during a 12-month period. The peatland surface was composed of microforms characterized by a difference in water level and vegetation composition. The distribution of microforms varied spatially within the peatland. To achieve correspondent half-hourly EC and chamber NEE estimates, we modelled microform level chamber fluxes, estimated them at each instance of weather recordings and integrated them over the year. We then scaled the fluxes up to the EC footprint. On a half-hourly time scale the correlation coefficient (R) of the NEE between the methods was 0.80 and the slope of regression 0.91. Measurements made in summer and during daylight were more highly correlated than measurements made in winter and during darkness. When integrated on a monthly time scale the methods agreed better, with R of 0.98 and slope of regression 1.00. The annual NEE for the EC and chamber methods were 206 and 242 g(CO2) m(-2), respectively. The study confirmed that the surface pattern of the EC footprint in the blanket bog was sufficiently homogeneous, that the changing wind direction did not influence the half-hourly NEE. However, the chamber estimates found that the annual NEE of the driest area within the footprint was 130% larger than that in the wettest area, indicating that large spatial variation can be found in NEE.

AB In the coal-bearing deposits of the Qiongdongnan Basin in the South China Sea, coal seams are for the most part extremely thin, typically less than 0.5 m. Coal streaks are commonly observed but are not concentrated. In addition, the ash content of the coal components is very high, indicating that the geological conditions of peat accumulation and coal formation were very unstable. For these reasons, it can be speculated that at the time of development, peat mires were relatively poor, in terms of inheritance and continuity, and were commonly not preserved. Coal measures, coal seams (in situpeat accumulation over long distances) and dispersed terrigenous sedimentary organic matter, which together constitute a type of complex coal source-to-sink system found in basin-marginal basins, include three aspects. (1) The material is homologous: whether autochthonous accumulation, allochthonous accumulation or dispersed organic matter is present, the total organic matter source is homologous,i.e.suitable for development and plant growth. (2) The process of organic matter transport (channel) is divided into three forms: vertical accumulationin situ, transport to relatively fixed areas by flowing water, and transport by other mechanisms with long-distance dispersion and drift. (3) There are three types of aggregation forms: vertical accumulationin situ, transport from flowing water to relatively fixed areas away from where plants grow and aggregate, and deposition in deep-water basins fixed with other substances; the latter type requires a period of time for long-distance dispersion and drift, including channel flow and surface flow.

AB Turbulent fluxes Of CO2 were continuously measured by eddy correlation for three months in 1997 over a gramineous fen in a high-arctic environment at Zackenberg (74 degrees 28'12 " N, 20 degrees 34'23 " W) in NE-Greenland. The measurements started on I June, when there was still a 1-2 m cover of dry snow, and ended 26 August at a time that corresponds to late autumn at this high-arctic site. During the 20-day period with snow cover, fluxes Of CO2 to the atmosphere were small, typically 0.005 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (0.41 gCO(2) m(-2) d(-1)), wheres during the thawed period, the fluxes displayed a clear diurnal variation. During the snow-free period, before the onset of veaetation growth, fluxes of CO2 to the atmosphere were typically 0.1mg,CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in the afternoon and daily sums reached values up to almost 9gCO(2)m(-2) d(-1). After 4 July, downward fluxes Of CO2 increased, and on sunny days in the middle of the growing season, the net ecosystem exchange rates attained typical values of about -0.23 mg m(-2) s(-1) at midday and max values of daily sums of -12gCO(2) m(-2) d(-1). Throughout the measured period the fen ecosystem acted as a net-sink of 130gCO(2) m(-2). Modelling the ecosystem respiration during the season corresponded well with eddy correlation and chamber measurements. On the basis of the eddy correlation data and the predicted respiration effluxes, an estimate of the annual CO2 balance the calender year 1997 was calculated to be a net-sink of 20gCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1).

AB Mercury (Hg) methylation is often elevated at the terrestrial-peatland interface, but methylmercury (MeHg) production at this "hot spot" has not been linked with in situ biotic accumulation. We examined total Hg and MeHg levels in peat, invertebrates and tissues of the insectivore Sorex cinereus (masked shrew), inhabiting a terrestrial-peatland ecotone in northern Minnesota, USA. Mean MeHg concentrations in S. cinereus (71 ng g(-1)) fell between concentrations measured in spiders (mean 70-140 ng g(-1)), and ground beetles and millipedes (mean 29-42 ng g(-1)). Methylmercury concentrations in S. cinereus increased with age and differed among tissues, with highest concentrations in kidneys and muscle, followed by liver and brain. Nearly all Hg in S. cinereus was in the methylated form. Overall, the high proportional accumulation of MeHg in peat at the site (3.5% total Hg as MeHg) did not lead to particularly elevated concentrations in invertebrates or shrews, which are below values considered a toxicological risk.

AB Water loss by evapotranspiration (ET) is a principal component of the hydrologic cycle in wetlands. Using micrometeorological techniques, we measured ET from a Sphagnum-dominated open fen in northcentral Minnesota (U.S.A.) from May to October in 1991 and 1992. The daily ET rate ranged from 0.2-4.8 mm d(-1) with a growing season average of 3.0 mm d(-1). The evapotranspiration rate of the fen was near the potential rate of open water evaporation when the vascular plants were actively growing and the water table level was within or above the rooting zone. Using a dual-source modification of the Penman-Monteith equation (Massman, 1992), we partitioned the measured ET into evaporation from the non-vascular Sphagnum surfaces and transpiration from vascular plants. The analysis indicated that about two thirds of the water vapour flux to the atmosphere was from evaporation when the Sphagnum surface was wet. Such an evaporative flux was expected because of vertical distribution of vascular plant leaves which had a small leaf area index (0.4-0.7) and intercepted only about 30% of net radiation (R(n)) during the day. The remainder of R(n) was thus available for evaporation from Sphagnum. Evaporation significantly decreased as the Sphagnum surface dried out. When the water table was within the rooting zone (0-0.4 m), the vascular plants absorbed Sphagnum-generated sensible heat, which amounted up to one third of their transpiration energy flux. Under these conditions, the total water vapour flux remained near its potential rate owing to the enhanced transpiration from vascular plants. A drop in water table of 0.15-0.2 m below the hollow bottom during vascular plant senescence resulted in ET rates lower than the potential rates by 5-65%.

AB Ten peat cores were taken from the catchment of Lochnagar, a remote mountain lake in the Caimgorms region of Scotland. Organic content, measured as loss-on-ignition (LOI), profiles of most of the cores are high (>90%) throughout. As the movement of spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) is insignificant, with steady accumulation, the peats can be used as an archive for reconstructing the historical records of SCP deposition. The SCP profiles of these cores were matched to the SCP dating features of a Lochnagar lake-sediment core so that the catchment peats could be dated. The results show that the start of SCP record is a good dating feature. The applicability of the rapid increase in SCP concentration for dating depended on the stability of peat accumulation, whereas the subsurface peak may be a useful future dating horizon.

AB Of the 80,000 hectares of Bord na Mona owned peatland coming out of industrial production in Ireland approximately the next 25 years, over 20,000 hectares has been designated for shallow lake creation. Four experimental lakes created by flooding areas of redundant cutaway peatland in Co. Offaly were monitored over a 3-year period in order to obtain baseline information on their water quality and trophic status. Results indicate that water chemistry in the constructed lakes was predominantly influenced by the depth and type of the residual peat layers at the sites, the degree of exposure of underlying inorganic subsoils and the type of hydrological regime. Nutrient status was strongly governed by catchment land-uses. Lack of recolonising vegetation at recently abandoned cutaway peatland sites made some new lakes particularly vulnerable to nutrient runoff and algal bloom development. Biologically, the embryonic lakes were characterised by rudimentary food chains, in which higher trophic levels were absent and where the microbiota played an elevated role.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; WATER; SOIL; CONTEXT; MIRE
AB Little is known about the processes of infiltration and water movement in the upper layers of blanket peat. A tension infiltrometer was used to measure hydraulic conductivity in a blanket peat in the North Pennines, England. Measurements were taken from the surface down to 20 cm in depth for peat under four different vegetation covers. It was found that macropore flow is a significant pathway for water in the upper layers of this soil type. It was also found that peat depth and surface vegetation cover were associated with macroporosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The proportion of macropore flow was found to be greater at 5 cm depth than at 0, 10 and 20 cm depth. Feat beneath a Sphagnum cover tends to be more permeable and a greater proportion of macropore flow can occur beneath this vegetation type. Functional macroporosity and matrix flow in the near-surface layers of bare peat appear to have been affected by weathering processes. Comparision of results with rainfall records demonstrates that infiltration-excess overland flow is unlikely to be a common runoff-generating mechanism on blanket pear; rather, a saturation-excess mechanism combined with percolation-excess above much less permeable layers dominates the runoff response.

TI INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGES ON CARBON ACCUMULATION IN HIGH ANDEAN

ID ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; VARIABILITY; RADIOCARBON; RECORD
AB High-altitude cushion peatlands contain important records for high-resolution palaeoenvironmental studies, due to their high carbon accumulation rates and sensitivity to climatic changes. In this study, we present the paleoenvironmental history for the last 2 500 years based on the study of APA01 core, located in the headwaters of the Cachi river basin in Ayacucho. Radiocarbon dating by an accelerator mass spectroscopy (AMS) and by an elemental PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL analyzer to estimate particulated organic carbon were determined. Our results reveal changes in the peatlands during the Late Holocene. The palaeo climate varied significantly during the last 2 500 years. During the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (ACM) from around 1040 DC (Before Christ - BC, in spanish paper) to 1300 DC, the drier climate caused a slowdown in peat accumulation due to a reduced water table inducing a reduced organic matter production with a negative peak of carbon concentration. At the end of the Small Ice Age (PEH), between 1600 DC and 1890 DC, carbon accumulation showed high variability. Subsequently, the peat environment is mainly characterized by a considerable increase of carbon accumulation rates due to high sedimentation rates that is possibly related to the retreat of glaciers in the Central Andes. The recent drastic increase in the sedimentation rate and the reduction of carbon concentrations are a warning of a possible future decline of these ecosystems.

AB Wetlands are the largest source of methane (CH4) globally, yet our understanding of how process-level controls scale to ecosystem fluxes remains limited. It is particularly uncertain how variable soil properties influence ecosystem CH4 emissions on annual time scales. We measured ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 fluxes by eddy covariance from two wetlands recently restored on peat and alluvium soils within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. Annual CH4 fluxes from the alluvium wetland were significantly lower than the peat site for multiple years following restoration, but these differences were not explained by variation in dominant climate drivers or productivity across wetlands. Soil iron (Fe) concentrations were significantly higher in alluvium soils, and alluvium CH4 fluxes were decoupled from plant processes compared with the peat site, as expected when Fe reduction inhibits CH4 production in the rhizosphere. Soil carbon content and CO2 uptake rates did not vary across wetlands and, thus, could also be ruled out as drivers of initial CH4 flux differences. Differences in wetland CH4 fluxes across soil types were transient; alluvium wetland fluxes were similar to peat wetland fluxes 3years after restoration. Changing alluvium CH4 emissions with time could not be explained by an empirical model based on dominant CH4 flux biophysical drivers, suggesting that other factors, not measured by our eddy covariance towers, were responsible for these changes. Recently accreted alluvium soils were less acidic and contained more reduced Fe compared with the pre-restoration parent soils, suggesting that CH4 emissions increased as conditions became more favorable to methanogenesis within wetland sediments. This study suggests that alluvium soil properties, likely Fe content, are capable of inhibiting ecosystem-scale wetland CH4 flux, but these effects appear to be transient without continued input of alluvium to wetland sediments.

AB Previous studies have shown that atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is detrimental to sphagna, which are a group of mosses that are important for carbon cycling in northern peatlands. Little is known about species interactions, such as relative responses of tall moss Polytrichum strictum Menzies ex Brid. and sphagna. We studied the effects of N deposition on growth, abundance, and CO2 exchange of the moss species Sphagnum capillifolium (Ehrh.) Hedw. and Polytrichum strictum in an experiment at a temperate bog. Sphagnum growth and cover decreased significantly with high-dose N treatment (6.4 g N.m(-2).year(-1)) in years 4 and 5 of treatment, whereas the same parameters increased for Polytrichum compared with the control. Net CO2 exchange, gross photosynthesis (P-g), and dark respiration (R) in the intact moss cores, which were measured in year 5 of treatment, were elevated in the cores that had been treated with the high-dose of N, compared with the control, and this was associated with increased abundance of Polytrichum. The moss cores where Polytrichum was removed, however, had increased mass-based R with the high-dose N treatment. Our results showed that S. capillifolium at Mer Bleue may be close to N saturation, as 5 years of high-dose N loading (6.4 g N.m(-2).year(-1) + background) was harmful to this species, possibly as a result of increased respiratory cost. Polytrichum strictum had a competitive advantage, at least in the short-term, through allocating excess N to growth. This change in moss layer composition deserves further attention, as a shift to more easily decomposable litter, without corresponding increases in plant production, could reduce the carbon sequestration of the bog.

AB This article reports on a two-year study on growth and yield of soilless high tunnel grown red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) cultivar 'Autumn Britten' in responses to fertigation solution electrical conductivity (EC), substrate and propagation method. Specifically, three fertigation solution EC regimes [constant fertigation solution EC at 1.2 dS m(-1) (control), EC value of 1.2 dS m(-1) and 0.8 dS m(-1) before and after the onset of flowering, respectively (lower EC) and EC value of 1.6 dS m(-1) and 1.2 dS m(-1) before and after the onset of flowering, respectively (higher EC)], three substrates (peat/bark, peat/bio-char and peat/coco fibers) and two propagation methods (bare-rooted plants derived from suckers arising from adventitious buds on roots and root cuttings) were tested. Plant growth, dry biomass and marketable yield were not significantly affected by higher nor by lower EC treatments over the two consecutive years. Compared to peat/bark substrate, peat/bio-char substrate reduced root dry weight in 2013 and peat/coco fibers substrate reduced root dry weight in 2014. However, marketable fruit number and yield were not influenced over the two years. Although the type of propagation method did not result in any significant difference in yield in the second production year, establishing plants from root cuttings reduced plant height, the number of laterals, cane diameter and shoot dry weight in the first year. Surprisingly, a significantly increased marketable fruit yield was recorded. This was mostly due to the advancement of the peak fruiting period induced by the early spring higher greenhouse temperature during root cutting propagation procedures, which indicates one approach to reach even higher yields in regions with short growing season.

AB Brown coal deposits of the Lower Rhine Basin, northwest Germany, cover the late Burdigalian to Serravallian and most of the Tortonian enabling access to observations of vegetation dynamics during the Miocene Climatic Optimum and Late Miocene Cooling. Based on a total of 500 microfloras sampled from brown coal seams in the Bergheim and Inden open cast mines, structural changes in the vegetation are studied in comparatively stable environments of persisting coastal mires. In order to minimize the impact of local edaphic conditions in the peat bog, the palynomorph record is characterized as diversity using plant functional types (PFTs). In total, 41 herbaceous and arboreal PFTs are assigned to pollen and spores types based on their botanical affinity.The diversity spectra reveal a variable proportion of herbaceous and shrubby PFTs attaining a mean of 30%, in both the middle and late Miocene sample sets. With ca. 70% of the total diversity attributable to arboreal functional types, the peat-forming vegetation of the studied Miocene strata classifies as a swamp forest. The composition of the arboreal fraction shows a long-term declining trend in the proportions of thermophilous evergreen types among broadleaved PFTs following the overall climate cooling throughout the studied time. Conifers became more diverse during the Langhian (ca. 15%, at a mean) and attained a high diversity level of ca. 20% of the total PFT diversity in the Tortonian. The diversity proportions of conifer PFTs among other arboreal components and the composition of the broadleaved angiosperm PFT fraction display a pointed short-term variability that could probably be related to eccentricity cycles when considering the available independent stratigraphic framework. Our results suggest a distinct coupling of the structure of the peat-forming vegetation and continental climate variability in the study area.

DE AMMONIATION; SORPTION; BOG PEAT; HUMIC SUBSTANCES; N FRACTIONATION
AB Ammonia sorption is an important peat property for making composts and peat-mineral fertilizers. In this study, we investigated the influence of moisture content of fibric, hemic and sapric peat materials on ammonia sorption capacity, and we determined the N forms and the amount of solubilized humic substances following peat ammoniation. Ammonia sorption capacity increased curvilinearly with degree of decomposition from the fibric to the sapric peats, and increased with peat moisture content up to 600 g H2O [kg wet peat]-1 in the range of 400 to 700 g H2O [kg wet peat]-1. The amount of chemically sorbed ammonia was highest in the sapric peat containing [600 g H2O] [kg wet peat]-1. On a dry weight basis, maximum sorption capacity was 24 g NH3-N kg-1 for the fibric peat, 29 g NH3-N kg-1 for the hemic peat and 49 g NH3-N kg-1 for the sapric peat. Ammonia loss of physically retained ammonia was greatest at the highest moisture content and for the least decomposed peat. At ammoniation rates exceeding 30 g NH3 [kg dry peat]-1, exchangeable ammonium and acid-hydrolyzable N were the dominant N fractions in ammoniated peats. Peat ammoniation increased significantly (p < 0.001) the amounts of water-soluble carbon in all peat materials, of fulvic acid in the fibric peat and of both humic and fulvic acids in the hemic and the sapric peats. At maximum ammonia sorption capacity, the total amount of water-soluble and alkali-extractable organic matter reached 338 g kg-1 in fibric peat, 683 g kg-1 in the hemic peat and 848 g kg-1 in the sapric peat. The hemic and sapric peats appeared more appropriate than the fibric peat for making peat-base fertilizers.

AB Despite their low primary production, ombrotrophic peatlands have a considerable potential to store atmospheric carbon as a result of their extremely low litter decomposition rates. Projected changes in temperature and nitrogen (N) deposition may increase decomposition rates by their positive effects on microbial activity and litter quality, which can be expected to result in enhanced mass loss and N release from Sphagnum and vascular plant litter. This is the first study that examines the combined effects of increased temperature and N deposition on decomposition in bogs. We investigated mass loss and N release at four bog sites along a gradient from north Sweden to northeast Germany in which both temperature and N deposition increased from north to south. We performed two litterbag experiments: one reciprocal experiment with Eriophorum vaginatum litter and one experiment using recalcitrant (Sphagnum fuscum) and more degradable (Sphagnum balticum) Sphagnum litter collected from the most northern site. We measured mass loss and N release during two (Sphagnum) and three (E. vaginatum) years. The N concentration and decomposability of the E. vaginatum litter did not differ between the sites. Mass loss from E. vaginatum litter increased over the gradient from north to south, but there was no such effect on Sphagnum litter. N loss of all litter types was affected by collection site, incubation site and time and all interactions between these factors. N release in Sphagnum was positively related to N concentration. We conclude that decomposition of vascular plants and Sphagnum litter is influenced by different environmental drivers, with enhanced temperatures stimulating mass loss of vascular plant litter, but not of Sphagnum. Enhanced N deposition increases Sphagnum litter N loss. As long-term consequences of climate change will presumably entail a higher vascular plant production, overall litter decomposition rates are likely to increase, especially in combination with increased temperature.

AB Mercury concentrations are clearly elevated in the surface and sub-surface layers of peat cores collected from a minerotrophic ("groundwater-fed") fen in southern Greenland (GL) and an ombrotrophic ("rainwater-fed") bog in Denmark (DK). Using C-14 to precisely date samples since ca. AD 1950 using the "atmospheric bomb pulse," the chronology of Hg accumulation in GL is remarkably similar to the bog in DK where Hg was supplied only by atmospheric deposition: this suggests not only that Hg has been supplied to the surface layers of the minerotrophic core (GL) primarily by atmospheric inputs, but also that the peat cores have preserved a consistent record of the changing rates of atmospheric Hg accumulation. The lowest Hg fluxes in the GL core (0.3 to 0.5 mug/m(2)/yr) were found in peats dating from AD 550 to AD 975, compared to the maximum of 164 mug/m(2)/yr in AD 1953. Atmospheric Hg accumulation rates have since declined, with the value for 1995 (14 mug/m(2)/yr) comparable to the value for 1995 obtained by published studies of atmospheric transport modelling (12 mug/m(2)/yr).
   The greatest rates of atmospheric Hg accumulation in the DK core are also found in the sample dating from AD 1953 and are comparable in magnitude (184 mug/m(2)/yr) to the GL core; again, the fluxes have since gone into strong decline. The accumulation rates recorded by the peat core for AD 1994 (14 mug/m(2)/yr) are also comparable to the value for 1995 obtained by atmospheric transport modelling (18 mug/m(2)/yr). Comparing the Pb/Ti and As/Ti ratios of the DK samples with the corresponding crustal ratios (or "natural background values" for preanthropogenic peat) shows that the samples dating from 1953 also contain the maximum concentration of "excess" Pb and As. The synchroneity of the enrichments of all three elements (Hg, Pb, and As) suggests a common source, with coal-burning the most likely candidate. Independent support for this interpretation was obtained from the Pb isotope data (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.1481 +/- 0.0002 in the leached fraction and 1. 1505 0.0002 in the residual fraction) which is too radiogenic to be explained in terms of gasoline lead alone, but compares well with values for U.K. coals. In contrast, the lowest values for Pb-206/Pb-207 in the DK profile (1.1370 +/- 0.0003 in the leached fraction and 1.1408 +/- 0.0003 in the residual fraction) are found in the sample dating from AD 1979: this shows that the maximum contribution of leaded gasoline occurred approximately 25 yr after the zenith in total anthropogenic Pb deposition.

AB . In two fen areas of northeastern Germany, different techniques of re-introduction to establish reed-bed species in formerly intensively used, species-poor, grasslands, after rewetting, were studied under three hydrological regimes (permanent inundation, temporary inundation, border irrigation) with the aims (1) to establish peat-forming vegetation and (2) to enhance species richness. Establishment was successful for nearly all species investigated under all hydrological variants. There were differences between individuals sown and those which had been planted. Wet, but not inundated soil linked with vegetation gaps create safe sites which enable successful germination and seedling establishment. The survival rate for both planted and sown individuals was generally high, with the exception of Cladium mariscus, Eupatorium cannabinum and Phragmites australis Recommendations for restoration management include the establishment of the following successful species: Carex acutiformis, C elata and C paniculata to establish peat-forming vegetation; Iris pseudacorus, Lysimachia vulgaris, Lythrum salicaria to enhance species richness.

AB The surface air warming over the Arctic has been almost twice as much as the global average in recent decades. In this region, unprecedented amounts of smoldering peat fires have been identified as a major emission source of climate-warming agents. While much is known about greenhouse gas emissions from these fires, there is a knowledge gap on the nature of particulate emissions and their potential role in atmospheric warming. Here, we show that aerosols emitted from burning of Alaskan and Siberian peatlands are predominantly brown carbon (BrC) - a class of visible light-absorbing organic carbon (OC) - with a negligible amount of black carbon content. The mean fuel-based emission factors for OC aerosols ranged from 3.8 to 16.6 gkg(-1). Their mass absorption efficiencies were in the range of 0.2-0.8m(2)g(-1) at 405nm (violet) and dropped sharply to 0.03-0.07m(2)g(-1) at 532 nm (green), characterized by a mean Angstrom exponent of approximate to 9. Electron microscopy images of the particles revealed their morphologies to be either single sphere or agglomerated "tar balls". The shortwave top-of-atmosphere aerosol radiative forcing per unit optical depth under clear-sky conditions was estimated as a function of surface albedo. Only over bright surfaces with albedo greater than 0.6, such as snow cover and low-level clouds, the emitted aerosols could result in a net warming (positive forcing) of the atmosphere.

AB To assess the biogeochemical effects of tidal restrictions on salt-marsh sulfur cycling and plant growth, cores of short-form Spartina alterniflora peat were desalinated and kept either waterlogged or drained in greenhouse microcosms, Changes in net Spartina production, and porewater and solid phase chemistry of treated cores were compared to natural conditions in the field collection site over a 21-mo period. Net production among treatments increased significantly in drained and waterlogged peat compared to field conditions during the first growing season. Constantly high sulfide in waterlogged cores accompanied reduced plant growth. Aeration invigorated growth in drained cores but led to oxidization of sulfide minerals and to lowered pH. During the second growing season, growth declined in the drained treatment, probably because of acidification and decreased dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Results are pertinent to the success of current wetland protection and restoration activities in the coastal zone.

AB In drained peatland forests ditch networks need regular maintenance operations in order to sustain their drainage capacity. These operations however have a significant impact on the quality of the runoff water from the ditched areas. Peak runoff control (PRC) method has been proposed as a possible method to diminish the load to water courses through retention of the runoff temporarily in the ditch network during maximum runoff events using dams with a plastic control pipe. However, blocking water into the ditched area for periods of varying length during the growing season may have a negative impact on the growth of the tree stands. In this study past stand growth was investigated in Central Finland in altogether 10 sample Scots pine thinning stands in which the PRC method has been applied 5 growing seasons earlier. In each stand, a pair of sample plots was established: one plot next to the dam within the influence of periodic flooding and the other one outside the effect of periodic flooding. For determining stand growth, field measurements were made in August 2009. Stand growth near the dam was on average 0.54 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1) lower than farther away from the dam but the analysis of covariance showed that the dam effect was not significant. The results of this study suggest that the PCR method does not decrease Scots pine stand growth during the first five year growth period after ditch cleaning.

AB While fen communities have been long known from northwestern Iowa, only recently have they been found to occur in northeastern Iowa, south oft he limit of Wisconsinan glaciation. Since 1984, over 2333 potential fen sites were surveyed in this region, and 160 were found extant. Extant fen sites can be divided into one of five classes dependent upon surficial geology: pre-Illinoian till, bedrock, eolian sand, fluvial sand, and oxbows. Five of eight soil chemistry variables differed significantly across these geologic classes, including organic matter, pH, available phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium. Soil pH, organic matter, and available magnesium were found to have fairly well-defined spatial gradients across northeastern Iowa fen sites. Four principal axes of climatic variation were also described from northeastern Iowa, and include temperature, precipitation, growing season, and summer precipitation. A total of 320 vascular plant taxa were located or have been reported from this community, with seven being only known from historical records. Fully 44% of the flora are considered rare in the region or state. Of these, 30% are rare in northeastern Iowa, 20% are rare in the state, 12% are listed for state legal protection, 11% are newly known from the northeastern Iowa flora, and 4% are newly known from the Iowa Rora. Even though northeastern Iowa flora currently cover only .01% of the northeastern Iowa land surface, they contribute significantly to state and regional biodiversity by harboring approximately 28% of the regional and 180% of the total state flora.

AB The quantitative relationship between stand growth rate and water table level in peatland forest sites has not been fully ascertained in the literature. In this study, we investigated this relationship by means of a bivariate regression model, Tree and stand attributes, including volume and past 5-year volume growth as well as median water table depth (WTM) during the 1984 growing season, were observed in 69 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sample stands with three subplots established in each stand. All stands were located in deep-peated, moderately rich to poor organic soil sites in Central Finland (61 degrees 45'-62 degrees 26'N, 22 degrees 40'-28 degrees 29'E) that had been ditched for forestry about 25 years earlier (1959-1961). Prediction models for the fixed mean functions for 5-year volume growth and WTM as well as estimates for variances and the correlation of random effects at plot and subplot levels were estimated simultaneously using bivariate regression methods. The correlation of model residuals at the plot level was highly significant. The model was applied to simulate stand volume development for a period of 20 years. Simulations illustrated the dynamic interaction of stand volume, volume growth, and soil water levels: deep initial WTM resulted in stand growth and volume-development increases and subsequently further deepened the WTM in the stand. The model can be applied to southern boreal drained Scots pine peatlands to estimate the WTM in different stand volume conditions and to assess the effect of stand management on WTM.

AB Peatland catchments store vast amounts of carbon. Humic lakes and pools are the primary receptacles for terrigenous carbon in these meta-ecosystems, representing sequestration hotspots; boreal lakes alone store ca. 120 similar to Pg C. But little is known about the mechanisms that preserve aquatic carbon stocks. Here, we determined the regulatory pathway of decomposition in relation to traditional limitations, namely anoxia, decay inhibiting compounds, low nutrients and acidity, using in vitro manipulation, mesocosms and natural gradients. We show that anoxia represents a powerful hierarchical preservation mechanism affecting all major limitations on decomposition and recapturing carbon that would otherwise escape from peatlands. Oxygen constraints on microbial synthesis of oxidases and nutrient-cycling enzymes, prevents the decay of organic matter to CO2, CH4 and N2O by allowing inhibitor accumulation and lowering nutrients. However, this pathway is sensitive to direct nutrient inputs and therefore eutrophication could initiate catastrophic feedback to global warming via dramatically increased greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying these process-specific limitations should inform better management and conservation of these vital systems.

AB This paper explores the degree to which palaeoecological analyses can determine the history of metallurgical innovation and complex technological developments that took place in the iron-and steel industries of the City of Sheffield, Yorkshire, England.
   A knowledge of the key scientific breakthroughs as well as documentary evidence of industrial growth and decline in Sheffield are used as baseline historical data with which to interpret the palaeoecological and geochemical evidence presented here as a result of investigations of peats and clays collected from the Tinsley Park Bog in the Lower Don Valley of Sheffield. These deposits were analysed for charcoal, pollen, mineral magnetic properties and some trace elements (Ti, V, Fe, Co, Ni Zn, and Pb). Metal concentrations (measured using AAS) were as high as 320 ppm Ni, 472 ppm Cu, 613 ppm Zn, and 827 ppm Pb. Compared to the typical concentrations found in crustal rocks, Ni is enriched in the peats and sediments by as much as a factor of 5 times, Cu and Zn by a factor of 10, and Pb by more than 60 times. the lowest concentrations of Cu, Ni Zn and V were found in the basal peats of Tinsley Park Bog, arguing against a natural geochemical source as the cause of the enrichments. The greatest Cu and Zn enrichments are found in the peats in the top 0.1 m of the bog, possibly an indication of a large Special Steels Plant which began production nearby in 1963. Below these levels in the peat, in contrast, Ni and V are relatively abundant. They are believed to reflect the manufacture of complex steels during the earlier part of the twentieth century. Lead is most abundant in samples from depths in the peat which are though to post-date the onset of coal utilisation at the nearby Rothervale Mine.
   Interpretation is hampered because at present there is no independent evidence of the antiquity of the peat deposits studied. Neither is there any clear understanding of the significance of the taphonomic processes which have influenced the geochemical and paleoecological records obtained from the deposits. Nevertheless, our present interpretation of the data presented here indicates that to a surprising extent, it is possible to detect in the peat monolith (i) evidence of the expansion and relative decline of the adjacent steel industry; (ii) the impact of this manufacturing economy and associated coal-mining upon the adjacent vegetation; and (iii) the introduction of trace elements in pure forms or as alloys, as steel-making processes developed through the 19th and 20th centuries.

AB In this paper, the stratigraphic occurrence of n-alkanes (C) is investigated in three peat cores (Mildred, JPH4 and McMurray) from the ombrotrophic peatlands in northeastern Alberta, Canada, to determine their origin, biomass input, and paleoclimatic significance. The molecular composition of n-alkanes is dominated by the > C-21 medium- to long-chain homologues, with a strong odd over even predominance. A number of n-alkane-based indices (e.g. predominant n-alkane, C-23/C-29, C-23/(C-27 + C-31), P-aq, ACL, and CPI), show changing conditions in the organic matter (OM) input from Sphagnum species or terrestrial vascular plants, which increasingly contributed upwards in the peat profiles, and through time. 13, and C-23/(C-27 + C-31) proxies are similar in the three cores, and allow us to infer vegetation variations that coincide with the climate alternations of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), Little Ice Age (LIA), and modern Recent Warming (RW). The utilization of ACL-ket and (C-23 + C-25)/(C-27 + C-29 + C-31)-ket proxies, performed in comparison with n-alkane proxies, further support the biomarker-based reconstructions of paleoclimate variations over recent centuries. This study suggests that n-alkane homologues are sensitive to vegetation and climate changes and thus are reliable biomarkers for tracking past shifts in vegetation and climate variations in peat archives.

AB Peat moss is the most used soilless substrate in the production of container plants in floriculture. Nevertheless, the drainage of peat bogs due to the peat extraction has increased the necessity of seeking products that could replace the peat that is used in plant production. Therefore, a comparative study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a biochar (B) - vermicompost (V) mixture, as a partial substitute for peat-based substrates, on the morpho-physiological characteristics of ornamental plants. Different blends containing B and V were compared to a baseline peat-based substrate (S) as control in the cultivation of two ornamental bedding plant species that are widely used in urban areas: geranium (Pelargonium peltatum) and petunia (Petunia hybrida). Plant growth and physiological parameters were assessed. Results showed that it is possible to grow container plants of these two species with commercial quality, using a peat-based substrate mixed with biochar and/or vermicompost (up to 30% V and 12% B). Plants in these substrates showed a similar or enhanced physiological response to those grown in the control using commercial peat-based substrate.

AB The organoprofiles of soils of the Russian European North are typified: five types are identified. It is shown that about 70 percent of the reserves of organic carbon are found in peat of soils with an accumulative-detrital type of organoprofile, which occupy about 30 percent of the area of the investigated region. According to radiocarbon analysis, the rate of peat accumulation is about 1 mm/year. With climate warming, an increase in the rate of growth of peat bogs and the binding of carbon of the atmosphere in the dead organic matter is expected.

AB Fatty acid composition of the crude lipid fraction of pest was investigated using several typical peat profiles in Japan, Fatty acid composition varied with the peat layers accumulated in a peat profile since 32,000 years BP, Deposition of long-range transported volcanic ash tephras also affected the composition remarkably due to the acceleration of decomposition, Fatty acid composition differed among high moor, transitional moor, and low moor peat profiles sampled in several locations in Hokkaido, Japan, The difference in the plants involved in the formation of peat was considered to be a very important factor determining the fatty acid composition, For example, arachidic acid was considered to be a good indicator for the presence of reed, while the percentage of stearic acid tended to be high in the high moor pear profiles dominated by sphagnum, As the fatty acids with a longer chain length were more stable than those with a shorter chain length, the percentage of longer fatty acids (C24 and C26) tended to increase and that of shorter fatty acids (C14 and C16) to decrease in the lower peat profiles, The drying of peatland also exerted a similar effect on the fatty acid composition.

AB Thaw of frozen peat in discontinuous permafrost zone produces a significant number of thermokarst lakes, which are known to contribute to Green House Gases (GHG) emission in the atmosphere. In palsa peatland of western Siberia, the thermokarst lake formation includes soil subsidences, lichen submergence and peat abrasion, leading to lateral spreading of the lake border, often intensified by ground fires. Mesocosm experiments were conducted during 3 weeks on tWo thermokarst lake waters interacting in 30-L tanks with surface horizon of peat, the dominant ground vegetation (lichen Cladonia sp.) and the ash produced by lichen burning at 450 C. The obtained results allowed a better understanding of physico-chemical factors controlling the enrichment of thermokarst lake water in organic carbon and metals, and evaluating CO2 sequestration/emission potential. The changes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), major element and divalent metal concentration in response to peat and lichen biomass addition were less than a factor of 2 over full duration of the experiment. Iron (Fe) concentration in the lake water decreased by a factor of 2 to 3 after the addition of peat and lichen biomass. The concentration of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates decreased by ca. 30 to 50%, presumably due to their co-precipitation with Fe hydroxide. The dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in tank with lichen increased by a factor of 5.5 0.5, likely due to respiration of algal component in closed environment Strong enrichment of the lake water in DIC, P, K, Ca, Mg, Si, Al, Ti, Mn, Mo, Rb, As, Sb and U upon the ash addition persisted over full duration of experiments and was significant (p <0.0001) compared to peat and lichen biomass treatments. These elements may serve as indicators of ground fire impact on thermokarst lake water's chemistry. The overall effect of ash leaching on aquatic ecosystems after ground fire of frozen Siberian peatland is predicted to be much stronger than that currently recognized for non-permafrost regions.

AB A mass balance approach was used to determine the factors influencing phosphorus and nitrogen dynamics in wetlands common to headwater catchments of the Precambrian Shield. The relationships of runoff, water level, water temperature, and anoxia to the annual and seasonal total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) retentions of a headwater Sphagnum-conifer swamp during 1987-1988 were examined. Annual retentions of TP (4%) and TN (10%) were low in the swamp. On an annual basis, inputs exceeded outputs of total reactive P, NO3-N, and NH4-N and outputs exceeded inputs of total unreactive P and total organic N. Seasonal trends in P and N retention were inversely correlated with runoff. Positive monthly retention coincided with low runoff and increased biotic assimilation during the growing season. Water table drawdown during the summer was associated with peat aeration and increased levels of P and N in surface and pore water. High levels of P and N in the swamp surface water during the fall and winter were coupled with increased runoff, saturated overland flow, and potentially low biotic assimilation resulting in a net release of TP and TN. Large flow through of waterborne inputs and flushing of regenerated P and N occurred during peak snowmelt runoff resulting in low annual retention.

AB Middle Jurassic strata from the Harald gas field in the Danish Central Graben include five coal seams. The precursor mires were situated in coastal plain environments, and peat formation occurred during water table rise related to relative sea level rise. In a sequence stratigraphic framework, the seams are situated at the transition zone between the lowstand and transgressive systems tracts or in the transgressive systems tract close to a level that can be correlated with the maximum flooding surface. Influence from relative sea level rise on peat accumulation is reflected in the petrographic and organic geochemical composition of the seams. The coals that represent peat accumulation during rapid relative sea level rise are characterized by a higher average hydrogen index, extractability, hydrocarbon yield, and thermally extracted and generated bitumen content (S-1+S-2) compared to the coals that represent peat formation during the initial stages of relative sea level rise (slow rate of water table rise). In the latter coals, Pr/Ph ratios are higher, and the content of C-29 steranes is higher and the content of C-27 is lower. With regard to thermal maturity, the coals are in the oil window and may possess the potential to generate and release liquid hydrocarbons, This is supported by the com position of oil samples derived from sandstones in the Harald field. Multivariate data analysis shows a positive correlation between S-1+S-2, which is taken to indicate the generative potential of the coals, and in particular the macerals telinite, telocollinite, and cutinite, the microlithotypes vitrite and clarite, and total organic carbon, Such a petrographic com position is favored in precursor mires characterized by continuously waterlogged, anoxic conditions. These conditions are best met in mires situated on the lower coastal plain during rapid relative sea level rise, The knowledge obtained from multivariate modeling of the data, and sedimentological and sequence stratigraphic interpretations of the coal-bearing strata, may thus make it possible to locate the coals with the highest generative potential.

AB The paper reports the results of a palynological study of a newly exposed section in the peat sediments of Bezdkov site and its correlation with the previous palaeobotanical studies. The main goal was to elucidate the stratigraphic position and paleogeographic development of fossil peat bog and its environment in the Protected Landscape Area A1/2Aarsk, vrchy and A1/2elezn, hory in the Bohemian-Moravian Uplands. The development of peatbog vegetation, as shown by the pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating, took place in the Holocene. Pollen analyses provide evidence for occurrences of wetland assemblages with huge representation of alder wood in all the part of succession, followed by willow near the Cerhovka Brook. Alnus and Abies were the dominant trees during all the time. The deciduous forests consist of elm (Ulmus), oak (Quercus), lime tree (Tilia), maple (Acer) and hazel (Corylus). The mosaic picture of woodland and wetland, which covered this landscape during the Upper Holocene, contrasts with the present day monotonous open lowland. Sediments of the peat bog provide information on the origin and vegetation evolution of this area.

AB The relevance of the research is caused by the polydispersity of humic acids and their insufficient study in peat soils of cryolithozone.
   The main aim of the research is to study the molecular mass distribution of humic acids in soils of mounds peatlands.
   Objects of the research are humic acid preparations isolated from two permafrost peats - from dry cryogenic soil of mounds (Hemic Folic Cryic Histosols) and soil from bare peat spots (Hemic Folic Cryic Histosols (Turbic)), over the entire depth of peat deposits.
   Methods: elemental composition, liquid gel chromatography.
   Results. The authors have studied the molecular-mass distribution of humic add preparations isolated from the hilly peatlands of the European North-East of Russia. The patterns of its changes along the profile are revealed. It was shown that the proportion of the low molecular weight fraction of humic adds in peat dominates and statistically significantly exceeds the mass fractions of the middle and high molecular weight fractions. The profile distribution of the number average molecular weights of humic acids of the two plots has a bimodal character, with maximum values in the upper and lower parts of the profile. High values in the upper part of the profile are associated with the presence of long unbranched carbon chains of paraffin fragments and fragments of oligo- and polysaccharides, leading to increase in the linear dimensions of humic acid molecules. The degradation of paraffin and carbohydrate fragments down the peat profile, leads to decrease in molecular wights of humic acids. The correlation dependences between the ratio x(H): x(C) and high molecular weight fractions of humic acids were established. The increase in molecular weights in the lower part of the profile is caused by coagulation of dispersed humic acids on peat mineral matrix. Cryogenic processes on the border of permafrost lead to significant transformation of humic acid structure with splitting off the least condensed molecular fragments. This is clearly reflected in decrease of molecular weights and polydispersity index of humic acids.

AB A peat bog in the Jura Mountains, Switzerland, provides a continuous record of peat accumulation since 12 370 C-14 yr BP. Periods of enhanced soil dust deposition (10 590 C-14 yr BP, 8230 C-14 yr BP, and after 5320 C-14 yr BP) are characterized by strongly elevated Ti/Sc and Zr/Sc ratios which imply an increase in the abundance (both relative and absolute) of heavy minerals such as ilmenite and zircon. With respect to trace elements such as Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sb and Au, the M/Sc ratios are at their lowest, and often approach crustal values, during periods of enhanced soil dust deposition. The lowest rates of atmospheric deposition of soil dust date from 8030 to 5320 C-14 yr BP, corresponding to the Holocene climate optimum, but here many trace elements exhibit their greatest natural enrichments: the average enrichment factor (calculated using Sc as the reference element, and normalizing to crustal abundance) was Zn 4.1 +/- 1.4, Sb 4.8 +/- 1.4, Cu 8.8 +/- 3.3, As 14.9 +/- 3.2, Au 53.9 +/- 25.1, and Cd 357.4 +/- 53.8. These enrichments cannot be explained by chemical diagenesis within the deeper sections of the peat profile during or subsequent to peat formation, but rather reflect the chemical composition of airborne material supplied to the surface layers of the bog at the time of deposition. The enrichments of trace metals in ancient peats, relative to crustal abundance, most likely reflects the natural enrichment of these elements in the fine fraction of soils during rock weathering. Periods of enhanced soil dust deposition such as the Younger Dryas cold climate phase (10 590 C-14 yr BP) are characterized by reduced vegetation cover, greater exposed soil surface, and higher wind strengths; these conditions promote the transport of locally derived soil materials of greater particle size, lower concentration of trace metals, and M/Sc ratios approaching crustal values. During the Holocene climate optimum, vegetation cover was extensive, and with lower wind strengths and a reduction in erodible soil materials, long range transport of soil dust became relatively more important to the soil dust inventory of the bog; soil dust particles in this size class are characterized by strong enrichments of a wide range of trace elements. At the end of the Holocene optimum, dust fluxes increased once again, due mainly to soil erosion resulting from the combined effects of human activities (tillage) and the climatic deterioration at the beginning of the Neoglaciation Period; this promoted the supply of local, more coarse soil particles with M/Sc ratios approaching those of crustal rocks. While biological cycling and volcanic emissions probably also contributed to the atmospheric supply of many of these elements in the pre-anthropogenic past, these contributions appear to be less important than the chemical weathering, physical fractionation, and atmospheric transport of soil dust particles.

AB Thompson Pond, a bog lake in Pine Plains, New York, has flora indicative of both ombrotrophic and minerotrophic conditions. Distinct community types within this wetland system include a peripheral moat, hummock swamp, floating vegetation mats, peat rafts, aquatic floating-leaved and submergent macrophytes, and open water. A false-bottom of unconsolidated peat overlies the lake bed. Vegetation composition is typically diverse in such lakes, which support species of both acidic and calcareous habitat affinities. We repeated a 1973-74 survey to assess changes in wetland flora after four decades. The recent survey yielded 218 vascular plant species, representing 66 families and 134 genera. The largest genus was Carex with 26 species. Forty species from the original survey were not relocated, and 97 species were found in the recent survey that had not been found in the original survey. Eriocaulon aquaticum, usually associated with oligotrophic waters, was common in the original survey and not found in the recent survey. Aerial photos were used to calculate the change in vegetation cover, revealing that floating vegetation mats and peat rafts expanded between 1970 and 2016. Nutrient loading from agricultural and residential land use within the watershed, in addition to the installation of a dam across the lake's surface water outlet have likely contributed to the floristic and community structure changes seen in Thompson Pond.

AB Plant functional types (PFTs) are used to make generalizations in modeling how plants impact ecosystem functioning. In boreal bogs the number of plant species is small, but several PFTs are represented, namely sedges, deciduous and evergreen dwarf-shrubs, as well as hummock, lawn, and hollow Sphagna. Despite the use of PFTs in modeling, the value of PFTs to describe the photosynthetic properties of bog plants has not been systematically studied. We aim to quantify the photosynthetic properties of typical bog plant species and assess how well PFT divisions reflect differences among species. We measured photosynthetic light response and physiological state of photosystem II of 19 species, monthly, over a growing season. Differences were assessed using principal component analysis and mixed models. Photosynthetic properties separated Sphagna into traditional PFTs, of which hollow species had the highest gross photosynthesis. Sphagnum photosynthesis had large seasonal variation, as monthly differences exceeded those among PFTs or species. The photosynthetic properties of vascular plants differed widely among species but did not follow traditional PFTs. Vascular plant seasonal changes were of less importance than interspecific differences. The results justify using PFTs to describe the ability of bog Sphagna to bind carbon, but do not justify the same approach for vascular plants.

AB The Northwestern Iberian Peninsula is a mid-latitude oceanic region with areas where different types of bog are frequent or abundant. The ombrotrophic nature of some bogs make than suitable for the study of accumulation patterns of heavy metals. One of these bogs, Penido Vello, was sampled to a depth of 2.5 m and analyzed in detail for its physico-chemical properties and Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations. Ash and organic carbon content, Ca/Mg molar ratios and a number of other characteristics support an ombrotrophic interpretation of the core. Concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cd were measured, showing important variations In the core. While Zn and Cd are concentrated mainly in the upper sections of the core with minor changes with depth, the Pb profile shows significant peaks in the deeper layers suggesting pre-industrial atmospheric pollution. Enrichment factors (EFs) calculated by normalising to Al correlate well with those calculated by normalising to Ti. Maximum EFs are 33, 56 and 52 for Pb, Zn and Cd respectively. While for Pb these values are comparable to those obtained by other authors, maximum Zn EFs are greater than those mentioned in the literature and may be attributed to the emissions of a nearby coal-burning power plant. At least for Pb the accumulation pattern suggests that atmospheric pollution can be dated back some 2800 years, and that pollution increased steadily since the Iron Age to reach considerably elevated levels, up to 5 times the 'background', during the Roman Empire. Changes in Pb emissions through time are in good accord with the prehistorical and historical record of the Iberian Peninsula.

AB Growing evidence suggests that tropospheric ozone has widespread effects on vegetation, which can contribute to alter ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics and belowground processes. In this study, we used intact soil mesocosms from a semi-improved grassland and investigated the effects of elevated ozone, alone and in combination with nitrogen (N) fertilization on soil-borne greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem C fluxes. Ozone exposure under fully open-air field conditions was occurred during the growing season. Across a one-year period, soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions did not differ between treatments, but elevated ozone significantly depressed soil CH4 uptake by 14% during the growing season irrespective of N fertilization. Elevated ozone resulted in a 15% reduction of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide, while N fertilization significantly increased ecosystem respiration during the growing season. Aboveground biomass was unaffected by elevated ozone during the growing season but significantly decreased by 17% during the non-growing season. At the end of the experiment, soil mineral N content, net N mineralization and extracellular enzyme activities (Le., cellobiohydrolase and leucine aminopeptidase) were higher under elevated ozone than ambient ozone. The short-term effect of single application of N fertilizer was primarily responsible for the lack of the interaction between elevated ozone and N fertilization. Therefore, results of our short-term study suggest that ozone exposure may have negative impacts on soil CH4 uptake and C sequestration and contribute to accelerated rates of soil N cycling.

AB Three drill cores from the marshlands of NW Germany, which cover the entire Holocene, were analyzed at high-resolution for bulk composition, Al, Fe, selected trace metals, and stable sulfur isotopes. The drill cores contain two lithological types of peat: (i) basal pears overlying Pleistocene sands and (ii) intercalated peats situated between clastic sediments of predominantly marine origin. The peat layers are characterized by distinct enrichments in pyrite due to microbial sulfate reduction under almost open system conditions with respect to seawater sulfate as shown by sulfur isotope partitioning. The main Fe source seems to be the freshwater environment. The determination of dissolved and particulate Fe of channels and small rivers close to the study area revealed a 50-fold higher Fe content of the freshwater environment when compared with North Sea water. Pyrite enrichments are explained by two scenarios: (i) pyrite formation coincides with fen reed peat growth (basal and intercalated) under the influence of a brackish water zone (salinity app. 5-15) and (ii) pyrite was formed after peat growth in the lowest limnic basal peat intervals. Maximum pyrite accumulation (TS 28%) occurs in latter peats that contain thin clastic layers as a result of tidal channel activities after peat formation. The occurrence of clastic layers may have favoured the inflow of saline groundwater. The peat layers are also characterized by enrichments in redox-sensitive trace metals (As, Mo, Re, U) and Cd, whereas Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Tl, and Zn reflect the geogenic background. Leaching experiments have shown that As, Co, Cu, Mo, Re, and Tl are predominantly fixed as sulfides and/or incorporated into pyrite. The remaining trace metals show no distinct trends, only Cr reveals a strong relation to the lithogenic detritus. Seawater is the dominating source for As, Cd, Mo, Re, and U. The remaining trace elements seem to have a freshwater source similar to Fe, In contrast to the distribution of pyrite, highest amounts of redox-sensitive trace metals are seen in fen reed pears (basal and intercalated) that were formed under a direct influence of seawater and brackish water, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that saline groundwater entering the basal peats was probably depleted in redox-sensitive trace metals, e.g. owing to microbially induced reduction of trace metals and subsequent precipitation as sulfides or fixation by organic matter.

TI Coal deposition in the Noric Depression (Eastern Alps): raised and

ID LATERAL EXTRUSION; PETROLEUM
AB Pull-apart basins often form during the late stage of continental collision. Provided appropriate climatic conditions, these basins may contain thick coal seams. Two such examples are the Leoben and Fohnsdorf Basins in Austria, which formed in Miocene times during the post-collisional stage of the Alpine orogene. Both basins contain more than 10 in of sub-bituminous coal. Despite similar ages, tectonic settings, and similar stratigraphic position of the seams within the sedimentary sequence, the properties of the coals differ significantly. The Leoben coal is quite clean, whereas Fohnsdorf coal is rich in ash and sulfur. Petrographical and geochemical methods were applied to reconstruct the environmental factors that controlled coal properties in these basins. Coal formation in the Leoben Basin commenced in an eutrophic, low-lying mire. This was followed by deposition of the main body of coal, which formed in an ombrotrophic raised mire. Coal deposition was only shortly interrupted by deposition of volcanic ashes. Due to an acid paleo-environment, the volcanic material within the raised mire was altered to kaolinite. Thick vitrain bands representing large trees are found in the lower part of the seam only. Siderite is the main inorganic constituent in the main coal body. Lakes within the raised mire were present during late stages of peat accumulation and were filled with sapropelic coal. The high ash yields of this facies are due to abundant siliceous sponges, siliceous crusts, and tuffogenic minerals. Finally, high subsidence rates caused the flooding of the raised mire and sapropelic shales were deposited in the newly formed lake. The iron, which formed siderite in the raised mire, and biogenic and abiogenic silica present in the takes within the raised mire, are derived from volcanic ashes. The high-ash Fohnsdorf coal was formed in a low-lying mire close to a brackish lake. The seam geometry is controlled by the progradation of a fluvio-deltaic system into the brackish lake, and its subsequent drowning. The roof of the seam is formed by coquinoidal limestones and sapropelic shales. The brackish influence reduced the acidity of the mire, which resulted in the transformation of volcanic glass into montmorillonite. The low acidity also promoted high bacterial activity, which together with the high sulfate content of brackish waters, explains the high sulfur and pyrite content of the coal. Its high content of biogenic (?) methane is probably another effect of bacterial activity. Low-ash, low-sulfur coal is restricted to thin layers. These might represent local raised mires, which formed after the withdrawal of a fluvial system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study was designed to show the effects of harvest time and frequency on biomass nutrient concentrations (total ash, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) as well as total nutrient removal potential by festulolium and tall fescue cultivated on a nutrient-rich fen peatland. The harvest managements included a three-cut (3C) and three two-cut (2C) systems which differed by two-week delays of first cut as: 2C-early, 2C-mid and 2C-late, representing phenological stages of pre-heading, inflorescence emergence, and flowering, respectively. In the study year, the grasses received 80-16-60kg N-P-K ha(-1) in spring and 80-0-100 kg N-P-K ha(-1) after each harvest (except final). Nutrient concentrations and total ash content in the biomass dropped sharply during spring-summer growth. Concentrations of Ca, Mg and Mn were significantly higher in tall fescue biomass during spring-summer growth, but for other nutrients, there were no consistent differences between the two grasses. Total ash in the biomass from 3C managements (1.1 Mg ha(-1)) was similar to 28% higher than in the biomass removed by 2C managements (0.8 Mg ha(-1)). Similarly, mean annual N removal by 3C (315 kg N ha(-1)) was 31% higher than by 2C (240 kg N ha(-1)) managements, but net removals (removed minus applied N) from both managements were similar (75-80 kg ha(-1)). Net P-removal by 3C (37 kg P ha(-1)) was higher than by 2C (26 kg P ha(-1)) managements, whereas total K removals in all managements were close to the applied K amount (i.e., net removals were close to zero). Whereas all crop/management combinations extracted more N and P than applied, the 2C-late approach is recommended since the biomass yield was higher than for the other 2C approaches, and it required less fertilizer and management inputs than the 3C approach.

AB Alpine ecosystems are, similar to arctic ecosystems, characterized by a very long snow season. Previous studies investigating arctic or alpine ecosystems have shown that winter CO2 effluxes can dominate the annual balance and that the timing and duration of the snow cover plays a crucial role for plant growth and phenology and might also influence the growing season ecosystem CO2 strength and dynamics. The objective of this study was to analyze seasonal and annual CO2 balances of a grassland site at an elevation of 2440 m a.s.l in the Swiss central Alps. We continuously measured the NEP using the eddy covariance method from June 2013 to October 2014, covering two growing seasons and one winter. We analyzed the influence of snow melt date on the CO2 exchange dynamics at this site, because snow melt differed about 24 days between the 2 years. To this end, we employed a process-based ecosystem carbon cycling model to disentangle the co-occurring effects of growing season length, environmental conditions during the growing season, and physiological/structural properties of the canopy on the ecosystem carbon balance. During the measurement period, the site was a net sink for CO2 although winter efflux contributed significantly to the total balance. The cumulative growing season NEP as well as mean and maximum daily CO2 uptake rates was lower during the year with the later snow melt, and the results indicated that the differences were mainly due to differing growing season lengths.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance often causes changes in communities. However, the mechanistic basis of these changes remains elusive. As all patterns in community ecology can be understood as a result of four processes (speciation, selection, drift, and dispersal), the effect of disturbance should depend on how disturbance disrupt these processes. We studied the effects of disturbance and productivity on species richness, community composition, and community dispersion (i.e., variation in community composition) in the vegetation of 120 boreal peatlands using null-model approach to determine whether community assembly processes differ between pristine and disturbed sites. Sites represented three peatland ecosystem types, each with two levels of productivity. Half of the sites were disturbed by drainage and half are pristine. Pristine and disturbed sites showed similar species richness. However, their community composition differed indicating a directional selection due to disturbance, whereas dispersion of disturbed and pristine communities did not differ suggesting no change in the relative strength of selection and drift. Our results suggest that understanding the combination of landscape level community changes and local selection pressures is important when restoration of degraded ecosystems is undertaken.

AB Climate change induced drying and flooding may alter the redox conditions of organic matter decomposition in peat soils. The seasonal and intermittent changes in pore water solutes (NO3-, Fe2+, SO42-, H2S, acetate) and dissolved soil gases (CO2, O-2, CH4, H-2) under natural water table fluctuations were compared to the response under a reinforced drying and flooding in fen peats. Oxygen penetration during dryings led to CO2 and CH4 degassing and to a regeneration of dissolved electron acceptors (NO3-, Fe3+ and SO42-). Drying intensity controlled the extent of the electron acceptor regeneration. Iron was rapidly reduced and sulfate pools similar to 1 mM depleted upon rewetting and CH4 did not substantially accumulate until sulfate levels declined to similar to 100 mu mol L-1. The post-rewetting recovery of soil methane concentrations to levels similar to 80 mu mol L-1 needed 40-50 days after natural drought. This recovery was prolonged after experimentally reinforced drought. A greater regeneration of electron acceptors during drying was not related to prolonged methanogenesis suppression after rewetting. Peat compaction, solid phase content of reactive iron and total reduced inorganic sulfur and organic matter content controlled oxygen penetration, the regeneration of electron acceptors and the recovery of CH4 production, respectively. Methane production was maintained despite moderate water table decline of 20 cm in denser peats. Flooding led to accumulation of acetate and H-2, promoted CH4 production and strengthened the co-occurrence of iron and sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. Mass balances during drying and flooding indicated that an important fraction of the electron flow must have been used for the generation and consumption of electron acceptors in the solid phase or other mechanisms. In contrast to flooding, dry-wet cycles negatively affect methane production on a seasonal scale, but this impact might strongly depend on drying intensity and on the peat matrix, of which structure and physical properties influence moisture content.

AB The energy budget and regulating factors were investigated over an estuarine wetland during one year of continuous measurement in 2006. The results show that the seasonal changes of the energy fluxes and Bowen ratio (beta) were greatly affected by incoming shortwave radiation and canopy growth. During the non-growing season and early-growing season, sensible heat (H) dominated the energy flux, and beta could reach a maximum of 2.5, while during most of the growing season, latent heat dominated the energy flux and beta fluctuated from 0.4 to 1.0. The energy budget ratio in growing season was about 0.76, and the value would be higher if heat exchange during tidal flooding was included. During tidal flooding days, beta was slightly higher than that at exposure days in most cases. Vegetation cover seems exert little effect on energy partitioning except in March when the standing dead grass intercepted the incoming radiation that might reach the soil surface and reduce the turbulence between soil and atmosphere, thus Suppressing the evaporation from the soil though the soil mositure was high at that time.

AB Peatlands are significant sources of the important greenhouse gas CH(4) and generally known as sinks for atmospheric CO(2) through peat accumulation. Accurate measurements of the subsurface concentrations of these gases are of pivotal importance for experimental studies improving our understanding of the dynamics and controls on the exchanges of these gases between peat soils and the atmosphere. In this paper we first briefly outline examples of different probe-based techniques for the determination of subsurface gas concentrations and thereafter we document the development and testing of two different membrane probe systems. Finally we discuss a few applications of the probes and show some results obtained by testing them in the laboratory. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Peat; Decomposition; Gas; Temperature; Pore pressure
ID NORTHERN PEATLAND; METHANE; CARBON
AB This paper presents the results of a study investigating the behavior of peat subgrade beneath a railway embankment. Instrumentation was installed to measure the temperature, pore water pressure, and vertical settlement at different depths within peat strata over a 3-year period. The pore pressures within the peat subgrade were observed to increase significantly during the warmer months (>10 kPa) and to be strongly correlated to the seasonal changes in temperature. However, no clear correlation was found between pore pressure and settlement. Gas bubbles observed coming up through ponded surface water beside the embankment suggested that pore pressure may be a result of the expansion of gas bubbles within the peat. To confirm this hypothesis, laboratory tests were conducted. Peat specimens, kept at room temperature and in an anaerobic environment, confirmed the potential to generate gas. Further, the pore pressures of peat specimens placed within a triaxial cell apparatus with a constant applied confining pressure showed a direct correlation to incremental increases in the temperature of the specimen. Measurements showed that a 30 kPa increase in pore pressure corresponded to a 10 degrees C increase in temperature. The results of this investigation showed the existence of gas within a peat subgrade and its effect on the pore pressure within the peat.

AB Bryophytes and lichens are an important component of biodiversity. Nevertheless, these cryptogamic groups are rarely included in floristic and ecological studies in southern South America. We present the first comparison of patterns of alpha and beta diversity of bryophytes and macrolichens in peatlands and Tepualia stipularis forests (TF) on Isla Grande de Chiloo, Chile. Two kinds of Sphagnum peatlands were studied, which were defined according to their origin and their vegetation, natural peatlands (GP) and anthropogenic peatlands (AP). A total of 86 species were found: 42 liverworts, 29 mosses and 14 lichens. The most species-rich sites were AP with a total of 52 species, followed by TF with 45 species, and GP with 21 species. The total bryo-lichenic diversity reported in this study was considerably higher than that reported in other studies for Patagonian peatlands. The three types of studied habitats showed significant differences in species richness and diversity indices. We found clear distinctions between the three habitat types, with significant differences in the floristic composition of GP, AP, and TP. Moreover, AP presented a species composition that has not been previously documented in TF or GP. They are the result of human action, but do not depend on continued human intervention for their maintenance. Therefore, here we propose to denominate AP as a novel ecosystem.

AB Geomorphology, geochronology and palynology are used to assess the development and stability of two channelled swamps on the Barrington Tops plateau. While both swamps commenced peat accumulation prior to about 4000 cal BP, new stratigraphic data indicate incision between 700 and 1000 cal BP, in response to regional climate change. Two broad stratigraphic units are identified in each swamp: the upper floodplain, comprised entirely of peat, and the inset floodplain, underlain by interbedded peat and fluvial sediments. Following incision, rapid vertical growth of the inset floodplain occurred on the Barrington River between 690 and 620 cal BP, and palynological data indicate a change from more saturated pre-incision swamp flora to less saturated post-incision swamp flora. Bankfull stage-height, achieved many times in a year, is remarkably consistent along the length of each swamp channel. Its elevation controls the overall elevation of the swamps by controlling the height of the water-table and hence the growth of swamp vegetation and formation of peat. In particular, contemporary channel dimensions control the growth and height of the inset floodplain, a process that results in the formation of an organic floodplain not previously described in the geomorphic literature.

AB Lead originating from coal burning, gasoline burning, and ore smelting was identified in Pb-210-dated profiles through eight peat bogs distributed over an area of 60 000 km(2). The Sphagnum-dominated bogs were located mainly in mountainous regions of the Czech Republic bordering with Germany, Austria, and Poland. Basal peat C-14-dated at 11 000 years BP had are relatively high Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio (1.193). Peat deposited around 1800 AD had a lower Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio of 1.168-1.178, indicating that environmental lead in Central Europe had been largely affected by human activity (smelting) even before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Five of the sites exhibited a nearly constant Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio (1.175) throughout the 19th century, resembling the "anthropogenic baseline" described in Northern Europe (1.17). At all sites, the Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio of peat decreased at least until 1980; at four sites, a reversal to more radiogenic values (higher Pb-206/Pb-207), typical of easing pollution, was observed in the following decade (1980-1990). A time series of annual outputs for 14 different mining districts dispersing lead into the environment has been constructed for the past 200 years. The production of Ag-Pb, coal, and leaded gasoline peaked in 1900, 1980, and 1980, respectively. In contrast to other European countries, no peak in annual Pb accumulation rates was found in 1900, the year of maximum ore smelting. The highest annual Pb accumulation rates in peat were consistent with the highest Pb emission rates from coal-fired power plants and traffic (1980). Although maximum coal and gasoline production coincided in time, their isotope ratios were unique. The mean measured Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios of local coal, ores, and gasoline were 1.19, 1.16, and 1.11, respectively. A considerable proportion of coal emissions, relative to gasoline emisions, was responsible for the higher Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios in the recent atmosphere (1.15) compared to Western Europe (1.10). As in West European countries, the gasoline sold in the Czech Republic during the Communist era (1948-1989) contained an admixture of low-radiogenic Precambrian lead from Australia.

AB The Scots pine is one of the most important species in European and Asian forests. Due to a widespread occurrence of pine forests, their significance in the energy and mass exchange between the Earth surface and the atmosphere is also important, particularly in the context of climate change and greenhouse gases balance. The aim of this work is to present the relationship between the average annual net ecosystem productivity and growing season length, latitude and air temperature (tay) over Europe. Therefore, CO2 flux measurement data from eight European pine dominated forests were used. The observations suggest that there is a correlation between the intensity of CO2 uptake or emission by a forest stand and the above mentioned parameters. Based on the obtained results, all of the selected pine forest stands were CO2 sinks, except a site in northern Finland. The carbon dioxide uptake increased proportionally with the increase of growing season length (9.212 g C m(-2) y(-1) per day of growing season, R-2 = 0.53, p = 0.0399). This dependency showed stronger correlation and higher statistical significance than both relationships between annual net ecosystem productivity and air temperature (R-2 = 0.39, p = 0.096) and annual net ecosystem productivity and latitude (R-2 = 0.47, p = 0.058). The CO2 emission surpassed assimilation in winter, early spring and late autumn. Moreover, the appearance of late, cold spring and early winter, reduced annual net ecosystem productivity. Therefore, the growing season length can be considered as one of the main factor affecting the annual carbon budget of pine forests.

AB Carbon flux models that are largely driven by remotely sensed data can be used to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) over large areas, but despite the importance of peatland ecosystems in the global carbon cycle, relatively little attention has been given to determining their success in these ecosystems. This paper is the first to explore the potential of chlorophyll-based vegetation index models for estimating peatland GPP from satellite data. Using several years of carbon flux data from contrasting peatlands, we explored the relationships between the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) and GPP, and determined whether the inclusion of environmental variables such as PAR and temperature, thought to be important determinants of peatland carbon flux, improved upon direct relationships. To place our results in context, we compared the newly developed GPP models with the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) GPP product. Our results show that simple MTCI-based models can be used for estimates of interannual and intra-annual variability in peatland GPP. The MTCI is a good indicator of GPP and compares favorably with more complex products derived from the MODIS sensor on a site-specific basis. The incorporation of MTCI into a light use efficiency type model, by means of partitioning the fraction of photosynthetic material within a plant canopy, shows most promise for peatland GPP estimation, outperforming all other models. Our results demonstrate that satellite data specifically related to vegetation chlorophyll content may ultimately facilitate improved quantification of peatland carbon flux dynamics.

AB A consensus about the development of freshwater wetlands in relation to time and space is urgently required. Our study aims to address this issue by providing additional data for a fine-scaled comparison of local depositional settings of Greek mires during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Lignite profiles exhibit phytogenic organic components (macerals) that have been used to investigate the past peat-forming vegetation structure and their succession series. The organic petrology of lignite samples from the opencast mines of Komanos (Ptolemais) and Choremi (Megalopolis) was achieved to assess the water supply, wetland type, nutrient status and vegetation physiognomy. A holistic approach (a study of ecosystems as complete entities) was carried out for a paleoecological reconstruction of the mires. Huminite, liptinite and inertinite were traced by means of their chemical and morphological differences together with the morphogenic and taphonomic affinities. The problem of combining independent information from different approaches in a multivariate calibration setup has been considered. Linear regression, non-metric multidimensional scaling and one-way analysis of variance tested the occurrence of palynological and petrological proxies. Although the lignite formation and deposition are less related to humid periods than expected, the resulting differences occurring in the reconstructed development stages appear to be related to astronomically forced climate fluctuations.

AB Accurate estimates of the quantity and rate of soil nitrogen supply (SNS) are essential to increase soil and farm N use efficiencies, in particular for soils high in organic matter. The objective of this work was to enhance the empirical understanding of the SNS of dairy grasslands on peat soils, using soil properties and weather variables. Data were collected from studies on herbage N uptake carried out between 1992 and 2017 in the western peat district of the Netherlands. For the period between March to mid October, SNS was estimated from the sum of mean growing season daily temperatures, soil organic matter (SOM) and applied calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) N with a residual standard error of 25-27 kg ha(-1). Each degrees C growing season temperature sum affected SNS by 78-90 g ha(-1) and each g SOM per 100 g dry soil affected SNS by 3.6-3.9 kg ha(-1), respectively. SNS was equally estimated for conditions with and without CAN fertilisation. Validation with data from independent field trials showed similar impacts of SOM and growing season temperature sum on SNS. The error of prediction of the presented models, however, was still too large for direct on-farm application and led to underestimations for a specific site. Nevertheless, the obtained models allow for an increased understanding of soil and farm N balances. The models can therefore be used for improved temporal and spatial SNS-adapted farming practice advice, which can potentially lead to reduced soil and farm N surpluses.

AB Peatland rewetting aims to restore biomass accumulation from peat-forming plants for climate change mitigation, biotope conservation and water purification purposes. Boreal spruce swamp forests in Europe have suffered heavily from drainage for forestry and are now a focus of restoration efforts. We measured Sphagnum height and biomass increment by allowing Sphagnum to grow through mesh nets located in nine undrained, nine drained and 18 rewetted boreal spruce swamp forests. At the moss patch level, rewetting led to a recovery of Sphagnum growth: height increment and biomass increment at the rewetted sites (5907cmyear(-1) and 14715gm(-2)year(-1), meanSE) were similar to increment at the undrained sites (49 +/- 05cmyear(-1) and 128 +/- 12gm(-2)year(-1)), while remnant patches of Sphagnum at the drained sites showed smaller increment (28 +/- 08cmyear(-1) and 76 +/- 19gm(-2)year(-1)). Sphagnum in the ditches at the drained sites showed similar increment as the moss at the undrained and rewetted sites, while ditches at the rewetted sites had the greatest increment (87 +/- 07cmyear(-1) and 183 +/- 16gm(-2)year(-1)). A higher water-table increased Sphagnum growth, and Sphagnum riparium grew more rapidly than the other species. At the ecosystem level, where information on moss cover was utilized, rewetting had increased Sphagnum production to values close to the undrained sites. At the drained sites, biomass production was 8 +/- 17g (mean +/- SE) m(-2)year(-1), at the rewetted sites 42 +/- 15gm(-2)year(-1) and at the undrained sites 66 +/- 12gm(-2)year(-1). Sphagnum cover was the most important variable that determined Sphagnum production in the ecosystem.Synthesis and applications. Drained spruce swamp forests appear to be a suitable target for restoration as they respond readily to rather inexpensive rewetting. The result points out that even in boreal conditions, restoration results can be achieved in a time-scale of years rather than decades. At the ecosystem level, rewetting had resulted in a biomass gain of 34gm(-2)year(-1) when compared to drained sites.

AB Quantifying landscape-scale methane (CH4) fluxes from boreal and arctic regions, and determining how they are controlled, is critical for predicting the magnitude of any CH4 emission feedback to climate change. Furthermore, there remains uncertainty regarding the relative importance of small areas of strong methanogenic activity, vs. larger areas with net CH4 uptake, in controlling landscape-level fluxes. We measured CH4 fluxes from multiple microtopographical subunits (sedge-dominated lawns, interhummocks and hummocks) within an aapa mire in subarctic Finland, as well as in drier ecosystems present in the wider landscape, lichen heath and mountain birch forest. An intercomparison was carried out between fluxes measured using static chambers, up-scaled using a high-resolution landcover map derived from aerial photography and eddy covariance. Strong agreement was observed between the two methodologies, with emission rates greatest in lawns. CH4 fluxes from lawns were strongly related to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, but their floating nature meant that water-table depth was not a key factor in controlling CH4 release. In contrast, chamber measurements identified net CH4 uptake in birch forest soils. An intercomparison between the aerial photography and satellite remote sensing demonstrated that quantifying the distribution of the key CH4 emitting and consuming plant communities was possible from satellite, allowing fluxes to be scaled up to a 100km(2) area. For the full growing season (May to October), similar to 1.1-1.4g CH(4)m(-2) was released across the 100km(2) area. This was based on up-scaled lawn emissions of 1.2-1.5g CH(4)m(-2), vs. an up-scaled uptake of 0.07-0.15g CH(4)m(-2) by the wider landscape. Given the strong temperature sensitivity of the dominant lawn fluxes, and the fact that lawns are unlikely to dry out, climate warming may substantially increase CH4 emissions in northern Finland, and in aapa mire regions in general.

AB This paper presents a high resolution reconstruction of local growing season temperature (GST) anomalies at Durres Maar, Germany, spanning the last two millennia. The GST anomalies were derived from a stable carbon isotope time series of cellulose chemically extracted from Sphagnum leaves (delta C-13(cellulose)) separated from a kettle-hole peat deposit of several metres thickness. The temperature reconstruction is based on the Sphagnum delta C-13(cellulose)/temperature dependency observed in calibration studies. Reconstructed GST anomalies show considerable centennial and decadal scale variability. A cold and presumably wet phase with below-average temperature is reconstructed between the 4th and 7th century AD which is in accordance with the so called European Migration Period, marking the transition from the Late Roman Period to the Early Middle Ages. At High Medieval Times, the amplitude in the reconstructed temperature variability is most likely overestimated; nevertheless, above-average temperatures are obvious during this time span, which are followed by a temperature decrease. On the contrary, a pronounced Late Roman Climate Optimum, often described as similarly warm or even warmer as medieval times, could not be detected. The temperature signal of the Little Ice Age (LIA) is not preserved in Durres Maar due to considerable peat cutting that takes place in the first half of the 19th century. The local GST anomalies show a remarkable agreement to northern hemispheric temperature reconstructions based on tree-ring datasets and are also in accordance with climate reconstructions on the basis of lake sediments, glacier advances and retreats, and historical datasets. Most notably, e. g., during the Early Middle Ages and at High Medieval Times, temperatures were neither low nor high in general. Rather high frequency temperature variability with multiple narrow intervals of below-and above-average temperatures at maximum lasting a few decades are reconstructed. Especially the agreements between our estimated GST anomalies and temperature reconstructions derived from tree-ring chronologies indicate the great potential of Sphagnum delta C-13(cellulose) time series from peat deposits for palaeoclimate research. This is particularly the case, given that a quantitative delta C-13(cellulose)/temperature relationship has been found for several Sphagnum species. Although the time resolution of Sphagnum delta C-13(cellulose) datasets certainly wouldn't reach the annual resolution of tree-ring data, reconstructions of past temperature variability on the basis of this proxy hold one particular advantage: often due to relatively high peat accumulation rates, especially in kettle-hole bogs accumulated on temperate latitudes over periods of up to several millennia, they allow extending temperature reconstructions based on tree-ring series into the past to enhance our knowledge of natural climate variability during the Holocene.

TI Absorption of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide by the Wetland Ecosystems of
   Russia in Holocene. The Problems of Paludification
SO LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL

AB Wetland ecosystems are the net carbon (atmospheric carbon dioxide) sink for the atmosphere. The analysis of paludification speed and intensity of carbon accumulation in the peat in Russia during the Holocene is presented. During that period most of the peat bogs were formed in Russia. According to the current estimates, the area of peat bogs is 1.68 million km(2), with wetlands - 3.69 million km(2). All these lands contain more than 100 billion tons of carbon (Gt 100.93). Russia ranks first in the world in terms of accumulated peat. Annually 66 thousand Ha are swamped in the world. The average speed of paludification in Russia in Holocene was 15... 18 thousand Ha per year. It varied under the influence of changing climatic, hydrological, geological, morphological and other factors, and it was significantly different in some natural zones and regions of Russia. For example, the average rate of paludification in Karelia (north-western part of Russia) in Holocene was 400 ha per year, while it ranged from 150 to 755 ha per year. The most intensive logging and peat accumulation was found during the Atlantic period of Holocene, when the types of wetland ecosystems and their balance were changed. The other areas of North-Western and Western Siberia of the Russian Federation have similarities of waterlogging. To date, the numerous data on the rate of carbon and peat accumulation in bog ecosystems of different types an average during the Holocene are gathered in Russia. These results are not complete and, unfortunately, make it impossible to determine the current rate of accumulation of organic matter in the marshes and the nature of the ecosystem functioning (whether a marsh is a net sink or a net source of carbon dioxide for the atmosphere). Marsh drainage may increase the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. To determine the current (over the seasons, decades) rate of net carbon accumulation the balance method and the method of mathematical modeling of the marsh ecosystem are used. The calculations of the present rate of net carbon accumulation by the swamps according to the R. Clymo model (as modified by I.E. Turchinovich) showed that it was 37.6 million tons of carbon per year. Currently, the process of paludification in Russia have been intensified as a result of the global climate changes and extensive damage of the drainage systems.

AB We examined the herbage production of different vegetation types and the live weight gain of dairy heifers grazing forest habitats over three consecutive years. Thirty-five heifers were grazing at high-grazing intensity (1 animal/ha) and 18 heifers at low-grazing intensity (0.5 animal/ha) in a ca. 15-year-old spruce forest with the vegetation types: bilberry spruce forest (57%); peat bogs (25%); and meadow spruce forest (18%). The herbage production was on average for all years highest in meadow spruce forest (2001 kg DM/ha), while it was similar in bilberry spruce forest and peat bogs (629 and 536 kg DM/ha, respectively). The average weight gain of the heifers was 509 g/d, with means ranging from 385 to 653 g/d for different years and grazing intensities. We conclude that estimates of herbage production were improved when the vegetation types of the grazing areas were taken into account.

AB Peatlands occupy a significant portion of the land surface of the Earth and form a targe carbon store. Most peat-forming systems have two layers. The upper layer, the acrotelm, fixes carbon by photosynthesis, loses some of it by decay and passes the remainder on to the lower layer, the catotelm. In the catotelm, decay continues at a slower rate. Mathematical models of the growth of the catotelm have been proposed which relate the cumulative mass of peat above a particular depth to calendar age of the peat at that depth. We demonstrate how (14)C dating and the Bayesian approach to data analysis can be used to make inferences about the relation between calendar age and cumulative mass, and to estimate the accumulation and decay rates.

AB Previous palaeoecological studies have shown that there have been major range shifts in Tsuga ( hemlock) during the middle and late Holocene that seem to indicate climatic cooling and an increase in available moisture. We examined lake-level changes and peatland growth at Glimmerglass Lake and peatland in the Sylvania Wilderness Area to determine if the mid-Holocene increase in moisture indicated by the pollen record also influenced lakes and wetlands. Sphagnum peat began accumulating at the site at 6240 cal. yr BP. Diatom-inferred depth reconstructions show that the lake level rose 2 m and the peatland expanded out of its basin at 5300 cal. yr BP. All of these changes occurred as the last remnant of the Laurentide Ice Sheet disappeared and orbital forcing reduced seasonality relative to the early Holocene. We conclude that these continental-scale factors caused increased moisture availability in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, resulting in rising lakewater levels and peatland expansion.

AB Methanotroph community structure and activity was investigated in a peat soil in which the above-ground vegetation was burned repeatedly during the last 50 years, and in soil unburned since 1954. Regular burning (every 10 years) was found to have no obvious impact on the potential methane-uptake capacity; however, a lower abundance of type I methanotrophs relative to type II methanotrophs in the frequently burned soils was observed using pmoA (encoding a key polypeptide of particulate methane monooxygenase) microarray analyses. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes indicated that the total bacterial community, and not just the methanotrophs, was affected by the burning. The regular burning also resulted in a decreased abundance of Calluna vegetation relative to mixed grasses in the peatland plots. In a separate mesocosm experiment, Calluna plants and their roots were removed from the peat soils for a growing season (from February 2006 to November 2006). It was shown that removal of Calluna from the soil greatly decreased the methane-uptake capacity of the soils, although no obvious impact on the methanotroph population structure was observed. Real-time PCR quantification of pmoA genes showed that the abundance of methanotrophs in barren soil (without Calluna vegetation) was about fivefold less than in the control soil (with Calluna vegetation). These findings indicate that the methanotroph community is strongly influenced by the above-ground vegetation cover. Burning of Calluna seemed to favour the type II metbanotrophs, whereas the removal of the Calluna cover did not appear to affect the relative abundance of methanotroph genera but caused a uniform decrease in the size of methanotroph populations.

AB We studied the effect of soil temperature on nutrient allocation and mycorrhizal development in seedlings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) during the first 9 weeks of the growing season. One-year-old seedlings were grown in Carex-peat from a drained and forested peatland at soil temperatures of 5, 9, 13 and 17 degreesC under controlled environmental conditions. Fourteen seedlings from each temperature treatment were harvested at intervals of three weeks and the current and previous year's parts of the roots, stems and needles were separated. Mineral nutrient and Al contents in all plant parts were determined and the tips and mycorrhizas of the new roots were counted. Microbial biomass C and N in the growth medium were determined at the end of the experiment. None of the elements studied, except Fe, were taken up from the soil by the seedlings during the first three weeks. Thereafter, the contents of all the elements increased at all soil temperatures except 5 degreesC. Element concentrations in needles, stems and roots increased with soil temperature. Higher soil temperature greatly increased the number of root tips and mycorrhizas, and the numbers of mycorrhizas increased more than did the length of new roots. Cenococcum geophilum was relatively more abundant at lower soil temperatures (5 and 9 degreesC) than at higher ones (13 and 17 degreesC). A trend was observed for decreased microbial biomass C and N in the peat soil at higher soil temperatures at the end of the experiment.

AB Boreal peatlands play a crucial role in global carbon cycling, acting as an important carbon reservoir. However, little information is available on how peatland microbial communities are influenced by natural variability or human-induced disturbances. In this study, we have investigated the fungal diversity and community structure of both the organic soil layer and buried wood in boreal forest soils using high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. We have also compared the fungal communities during the primary colonization of wood with those of the surrounding soils. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) confirmed that the community composition significantly differed between soil types (P< 0.001) and tree species (P< 0.001). The distance-based linear models analysis showed that environmental variables were significantly correlated with community structure (P< 0.04). The availability of soil nutrients (Ca [P = 0.002], Fe [P = 0.003], and P [P = 0.003]) within the site was an important factor in the fungal community composition. The species richness in wood was significantly lower than in the corresponding soil (P< 0.004). The results of the molecular identification were supplemented by fruiting body surveys. Seven of the genera of Agaricomycotina identified in our surveys were among the top 20 genera observed in pyrosequencing data. Our study is the first, to our knowledge, fungal high-throughput next-generation sequencing study performed on peatlands; it further provides a baseline for the investigation of the dynamics of the fungal community in the boreal peatlands.

AB Eddy covariance (EC) technique is a widely used method to quantify the net exchange of CO2 between ecosystems and the atmosphere. The quality control and data analysis of calculated fluxes are essential to ensure accurate budget estimates. Ecosystem scale CO2 exchange between a typical permafrost peatland of the Great Hing'an Mountains and the atmosphere was measured during the growing season of 2014 and 2015 using the open-path eddy covariance technique. Footprint analysis and turbulence stationary test were applied to the calculated fluxes to improve the data accuracy. High quality data were then screened to study emission patterns. Combining widely used models with the observed data, an empirical model derived by photosynthetically active radiation was developed to fit daily photosynthesis reduction. Seasonal variation of apparent quantum yield (alpha, mol CO2 mol(-1) photon), maximum photosynthesis rate (P-max, mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) and temperature sensitivity for respiration (E-0, K) were found to follow a unimodal distribution and could be simulated by a Gaussian based equation. The use of EC data and the potential issues, especially the bias on respiration estimation, were discussed. Detailed utilization and analyses of the EC data are helpful in revealing the CO2 exchange patterns on different time scales, and also contribute to reducing the result differences between EC and other measurement techniques.

AB In this study we quantify the partitioning of recent assimilates to above- and below-ground carbon (C) pools in two subarctic mire ecosystems - wet minerotrophic and semiwet ombrotrophic mire - using in situ C-14 pulse-labelling. Ecosystem C partitioning to rhizomes, coarse roots, fine roots, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbes were quantified twice during the growing season at three different soil depths. Finally the C-14-partitioning data from this and a previous study were combined to estimate the overall C partitioning of the three main vegetation types of a Scandinavian subarctic mire in early and late summer.
   The semiwet ombrotrophic ecosystem hosted a much larger root biomass on an area basis compared to the wet minerotrophic ecosystem which might be due to differences in the soil nutrient level. Microbial C was found to be the largest C-pool in both ecosystems. Ecosystem C-14 partitioning was poorly related to plant biomass for the semiwet and the wet ecosystem. Overall a higher partitioning of recent assimilates to below-ground compartments was apparent in August-September compared to June-July, while the opposite was found for the above-ground C-pools. In the semiwet ecosystem twice as much C-14 was found in DOC compared to the wet ecosystem, where root density, litter and above-ground biomass were important controls of the C-14-recovery in DOC. Plant-derived DOC was estimated to be 15.4 versus 12.9 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the semiwet and wet ecosystem, respectively.
   Graminoid dominated and dwarf shrub dominated vegetation types of the subarctic mire Stordalen differ with respect to the relative amount of recently assimilated C partitioned to C-pools with "slow" versus "fast" decomposition rate. The capacity for sequestration of recently fixed C within "slow" C-pools might affect the ecosystem C balance (NEE) and C-storage. The potential for vegetation changes might therefore be an important factor to consider in studies of response of ecosystem C-dynamics to global change factors in subarctic mires.

AB Our earlier study in New Brunswick, Canada showed that Spartina pectinata Link survived very well after transplantation in a barren cutover bog that was contaminated by seawater, in all combinations of salinity and moisture content tested. However, the survival of Juncus balticus Willd. was adversely affected in areas with very high moisture contents. The main aim of this current study was to understand the salinity tolerance of both species grown in salinized peat fields by determining how much salt ions, especially Na+ and Cl- were accumulated in the above-ground and below-ground parts of these plants. A second aim of this paper was to determine the accumulation of potentially toxic metals Fe and Mn. S. pectinata had significantly greater concentrations of Na+ and Cl- in the above- than in the below-ground parts. In contrast, J. balticus had Na+ concentration significantly greater in the below- than in the above-ground parts while for Cl-, there was no significant difference. These contrasting patterns of Na+ accumulation demonstrated typical characteristics of a halophyte (S. pectinata)and a glycophyte tolerant to salinity (J. balticus)described in literature. Fe and Mn concentrations in both species were low but only Fe approached deficiency levels in plants. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Estimates of the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes resulting from sheep grazing upon upland peat soils have never been fully quantified. Previous studies have been limited to individual flux pathways or to comparing the presence to the absence of sheep grazing. Therefore, this study combines a model of the physical impact of grazing with models of: biomass production; energy usage in sheep; and peat accumulation. These combined modelling approaches enabled this study to consider the indirect and direct impacts of sheep upon the carbon and greenhouse gas balance of a peatland at different grazing intensities as well as the changes between grazing intensities. The study considered four vegetation scenarios (Calluna sp., Molinia sp.; reseeded grasses, and Agrostis-Festuca grassland) and a mixed vegetation scenario based upon the vegetation typical of upland peat ecosystems in northern England. Each scenario was considered for altitudes between 350 and 900 m above sea level and for grazing intensities between 0.1 and 2 ewes/ha. The study can show that the total GHG flux at the vegetative carrying capacity tended to decline with increasing altitude for all vegetation scenarios considered except for Molinia sp. The average total GHG flux for all scenarios was 1505 kg CO(2)eq/ha/yr/(ewe/ha), and on average 89% of the fluxes were directly from the sheep and not from the soil, and are therefore not unique to a peat soil environment. The study suggests that emission factors for upland sheep have been greatly underestimated. By comparing the total flux due to grazers to the flux to or from the soil that allows the study to define a GHG carry capacity, i.e. the grazing intensity at which the flux due to grazing is equal to the sink represented by the peat soils, this GHG carrying capacity varies between 0.2 and 1.7 ewes/ha with this capacity declining with increasing altitude for all model scenarios.

AB Three modem pristine and one previously polluted ombrotrophic peat were sampled and analysed to investigate whether the isotopic composition of atmospheric sulphur inputs could be preserved in the organic fraction of ombrotrophic peats without undue alteration through syn-depositional or diagenetic effects. Peat type (reflecting the environment of deposition and diagenesis) was shown to be critical in determining whether an environmental archive of sulphur deposition could be preserved within the profile.
   Of the pristine peats sampled, hummock peat from Shetland proved to be the most suitable exhibiting a near-constant delta S-34 characteristic of the growing vegetation in the organic fraction of peat in the upper 30 cm of the profile. However, only short to medium term changes (< 600 years) in input are likely to be preserved due to the masking effect produced by incorporation of sulphide, derived from bacterial sulphate reduction (BSR), into the organic fraction at depth. The organic fraction of peat sampled from waterlogged pools at Forsinard (NE Scotland) was masked by sulphide incorporation throughout the profile, while peat from Abisko (N. Sweden) was exposed to annual freeze-thaw cycles, which appear to have produced significant decomposition of the organically bound sulphur and loss of the original depositional isotopic signal.
   Three peat types were sampled from the southern Pennines, an area with a gross history of sulphur pollution during the Industrial Revolution: high hummock peat, low hummock peat and waterlogged peat from a pool complex. In drier, high and low hummock peat types, diagenesis and decomposition were not found to be significant processes in the upper portions of the peat. Hence, alterations in the isotopic composition of the organic sulphur fraction in the profile reflect that of the depositional environment. In the hummock peats, organically bound sulphur becomes isotopically lighter at around 1400 AD, which may reflect alterations in local sulphur inputs at this time due to the small-scale smelting of lead in the area. Isotopic compositions become progressively lighter still towards the peat surface layers, which correlate well with the excesses of sulphur deposition, largely from coal burning, during the Industrial Revolution.

AB This study aims to develop models to describe CO2 fluxes in terms of environmental and meteorological variables and their variation over an Atlantic blanket bog in Glencar, southwest Ireland. Ten full years (September 2002-August 2012) of data were included in the assessment of CO2 flux and micrometeorological data. Models were based on non-gapfilled growing season data, using complete calendar years for annual models, and the entire time-series for weekly models, whilst taking interaction between variables into account for increased model accuracy. This was to determine which environmental variables were most influential in directly controlling CO2 exchange on a long- and short-term basis. A homogeneity of slopes (HOS) model was used to determine if there was any ecosystem response to indirect effects (functional response) of environmental or meteorological interannual variation. This model uses multiple regression analysis to determine if the ecosystem response can be better predicted as a linear function of the variables using a single slope model for all years, or a separate slopes model for each year. The separate slopes model gave a different (and improved) outcome for both daytime and night-time CO2 fluxes, and so functional responses were deemed to have occurred. The contribution to variation of day and night-time net ecosystem exchange (NEEday and NEEnight respectively) was then separated into four components: indirect functional responses, direct interannual meteorological variability, direct week to week meteorological variability, and random error, which identified 13.8%, 36.6%, 28.2% and 21.4% respectively of the variation in NEEday, as well as 23.4%, 24.4%, 22.2% and 30% respectively of the variation in NEEnight. Water table level (WTL) had the greatest influence upon functional variation of NEE at the Glencar blanket peatland, and comparisons of modelled NEEday with leaf area index (LAI) measurements verified the estimate of functional contribution using the separate slopes model. The significance of interannual variation (IAV) and functional responses on NEE at Glencar suggests that it is a resilient ecosystem which might be able to adapt to environmental or climatic changes, although given current climate change predictions, it is likely to have a reduced carbon dioxide sink status in the future.

ID OKAVANGO DELTA; ARCHIVES; BOTSWANA; SYSTEM
AB The Witwatersrand mining and industrial complex sprang up on the southern flank of the Witwatersrand watershed in 1886. Growth of the complex has been exponential. A pilot study was undertaken in peatlands formed along the Klip River, that drains the area, to assess the magnitude of the geochemical signature imparted by pollution arising from the complex. Carbon dating indicates that peat accumulation began in the study area more than 2500 years ago. The establishment of the Witwatersrand conurbation is clearly recorded in the peat in the form of rising concentrations of P, Cu, U, Hg, Cd, Ni, Co, Zn and Pb. Whilst seepage from mine tailings has contributed to pollution, the relative increases in heavy meta abundances suggest that industrial sources are probably equally important. Rapid rise in P abundance indicates a substantial contribution from domestic wastes. The growth of the conurbation was also accompanied by a 10-fold increase in the peat accumulation rate and a corresponding rise in the rate of erosional degradation in the catchment. Sequestration of metals by the peat has protected the Vaal River drainage system from extensive pollution, so that future protection of the wetland is essential.

AB The intermontane basin of Ptolemais is part of a major tectonic trench, located in NW Greece and includes around 65% of Greek coal reserves. The Upper Xylite Layer (UXL) is a distinct lignite layer, being 3-6 m thick and outcropping in the upper part of the Pliocene Lignite-bearing Sequence at the Notio Field and Tomeas Eksi Mines of Ptolemais. Compared with the xylite-rich lithotypes, the matrix lithotypes within UXL contain more ash. Micropetrographic studies suggest that the Upper Xylite Layer is rich in huminite (> 90%). Textinite dominates in the xylite-rich lithotypes, while attrinite dominates in the matrix lithoty es. The liptinite content is < 10%, while inertinite rarely occurs. Palaeobotanical determination revealed that the xylite. P rich coal originated from Coniferous vegetation, specifically from Glyptostrobus europaeus. The occurrence of G. europaeus as a coal-forming element is significant because, though this kind of vegetation was common in many Greek coals of Miocene age, this is the first time it has been recorded from the Pliocene. This study suggests that the Upper Xylite Layer is autochthonous. According to coal-facies diagrammes, peat accumulated under pure telmatic conditions in a relatively wet forest fen. Both herbaceous and arboreal vegetation contributed to peat formation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methodological lessons include: (1) Sub-decadal resolution in upper, little-decomposed peat layers reveals recurrent marked fluctuations in both percentages and influx of regional tree-pollen types, reflecting variations in pollen production rather than in plant-population sizes. (2) Intermittent, single-spectrum pollen maxima in samples of sub-decadal resolution indicate pollen transport in clumps. This type of pollen transport may remain unrecognized in sections with lower sampling resolution, which may then lead to inappropriate interpretation in terms of plant-population sizes. (3) The detection of short-lived phases of human impact in decomposed peat requires sampling intervals as close as 0.2 cm. (4) PAR (pollen influx) may reflect vegetation dynamics more faithfully than percentages. Reliable PAR, however, is difficult to achieve in Alpine mires due to past human impact on peat growth, even when complex depth-age modelling techniques are used. Critical comparison of PAR with percentages is therefore essential. (5) Careful consideration of spatial scales in pollen signals (local-regional and subdivisions) is essential for a realistic palaeo-ecological interpretation. Results in terms of past human impact on vegetation are summarized as follows: (1) Trends in pollen types reflecting regional human action are in general agreement with earlier findings for the western Swiss Alps, allowing for regional differences. (2) All mires in the Alps investigated here and in an earlier study experienced human impact during the last millennium. The studied small lake, lying in sub-alpine pasture, records forest dynamics at a lower elevation since a.d. 800.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) inventories are important tools for studying the effects of land-use and climate change and evaluating climate-change policies. A detailed inventory of SOC in the agricultural soils of the federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg was therefore prepared based on the highest-resolution geo-referenced soil, land-use, and climate data (BUK200 inventory). In order to estimate the quality of different approaches, C inventories of the region were also prepared based on data from the National Inventory Report (UBA, 2003) and by applying the IPCC (1997) method to the two data sets. Finally, the BUK200 inventory was used to estimate potentials of no-tillage agriculture (NT) and peatland restoration to contribute to C sequestration and greenhouse-gas (GHG)-emission mitigation since both measures are discussed in this context. Scenario assumptions were change to NT on 40% of the cropland and restoration of 50% of cultivated peatlands within 20 years.
   On average, grasslands contained 9.5 kg C m(-2) to 0.3 m depth as compared to only 6.0 kg C m(-2) under cropland, indicating strong land-use effects. The SOC content depended strongly on waterlogging and elevation, thus reflecting reduced C mineralization under aquic moisture regimes and low temperatures. Comparison of the BUK200 inventory with the approach used for UBA (2003) showed high inconsistencies due to map resolution and SOC contents, whereas the IPCC method led to fairly good agreements. Results on the simulated effects of NT and peatland restoration suggested that 5%-14% of total agricultural GHG emissions could be abated with NT whereas peat restoration appeared to have a minor mitigation potential (0.2%-2.7%) because the total area of cultivated organic soils was too small to have larger impact.

AB Humic substances (HS) extracted from 14 Sphagnum peats of various geographical origin were submitted to capillary electrophoresis (CE) in free solution and in entangled polymer solutions (25 g l(-1) and 50 g l(-1)) of polyethylene glycol (PEC). Electrophoretic runs were made in uncoated capillaries (75 mu m internal diameter) using a tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane (TRIS)-phosphate buffer (pH 8.3) eventually containing PEG and applying a voltage of 10 kV. The HS extract of a Lithuanian peat was fractionated by ultrafiltration into five fractions with a nominal mean relative molecular mass (M) of 3000, 7500, 20 000, 75 000 and 200 000 Da. Without PEG, migration times were not correlated with the logarithm of M, but linear relations were obtained with 25 g l(-1) and 50 g l(-1) PEG solutions. Both solutions separated the different fractions by size; the best regression and the largest interval of linearity, M from 3000 to 200 000 Da, was obtained with the 25 g l(-1) PEG solution. At 10 kV and without PEG, migration times ranged from 6.5 to 8.1 min and did not differentiate the peats, whereas at 25 g l(-1) PEG, migration times ranged from 3.3 to 6.5 min and, when plotted as a function of either the r value or the von Post index (H), which are used to evaluate the degree of decomposition of horticultural peats, they separated samples on the basis of their geographical origin and probable type of mire complex. At 25 g l(-1) PEG, migration times also showed a well-defined linear decreasing trend with the increase of mean annual temperatures. These relations suggest the hypothesis that humification in mires goes along with an increase in the average size of humic molecules.

AB Nutrient fluxes in surface waters and processes controlling nutrient retention and loss were measured through 1 yr in a 15-ha cranberry bog discharging to a shallow embayment of Buzzards Bay, MA. Continuous measurements of streamflow and nutrient concentrations, periodic measures of nutrient release by sediments, inputs from rainfall, and exchanges with plant pools were used to construct a nitrogen balance for the bog and to estimate dissolved phosphate fluxes. Nutrient losses were small during the growing season and greatest in the fall with plant senescence and harvest. Of nitrogen inputs to the bog, 33% was fertilizers, 8% was rain, and 59% was in inflowing streamwaters. While the bog plants and sediments were net sinks for nitrogen, the fertilizers associated with cranberry agriculture resulted in the bog serving as a source of nitrogen to outflowing streamwaters discharging to the adjacent bay. Net losses of 25 kmol of N were almost completely to the outflowing stream (93%) with harvested berries and leaves accounting for 5% and 2%, respectively. NH4+ accounted for most of the N loss to streamflow, 53%. Annual PO43- losses of 4.8 kmol were associated mainly with reduced soil oxidation due to flooding for harvest and frost protection. Net losses of total N, 1.7 kmol ha(-1) yr(-1), or DIN + PON, 1.8 kmol ha(-1) yr(-1), were similar to a surface water-dominated freshwater wetland but much lower than the nitrogen contribution from an adjacent residential development.

AB Lipid biomarkers extracted from a peat core obtained from the northeast edge of the Tibetan Plateau have provided a 13 kyr record of regional climate change. A period of warmer climate corresponding to the Holocene Optimum between 9 ka and 5 ka is evident in greater alteration of n-alkanoic acids and n-alkanols and in the appearance of biomarkers indicative of greater microbial activity. Concomitant increases in local precipitation that raised the water level of the peat bog are recorded by increases in the proportions of C-23 and C-25 n-alkanes that are mainly derived from submerged/floating plants. Alternations in submergent and emergent plant n-alkane proxies reveal multi-decimeter scale rises and falls in the bog water level that relate to variation in precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene. Major low water level events occurred around 12.6, 11.3, 10.7, 9.4, 8.3, 6.0, 4.5, 3.1, 2.1 and 1.0 ka. These events correlate well with cold dry events recorded in same region from other climatic proxies that reflect millennial-scale Holocene instability in the Asian monsoon system. Our biomarker results also indicate that peat accumulation and preservation on the Tibetan Plateau are more sensitive to variability in monsoonal precipitation than in annual temperature.

AB Ombrotrophic, oceanic bogs in southern Patagonia have not yet been studied with respect to ongoing belowground organic matter decomposition. To obtain such information we analyzed three sites differing in precipitation and sea spray input and quantified concentration patterns and C-12/13 isotopic composition of CO2 and CH4 and iron, sulfur and trace metal contents that can influence decomposition. Concentrations of CO2 and CH4 increased with depth and reached 4,000-6,000 A mu mol L-1 of CO2 and 500-1,400 A mu mol L-1 of CH4. Chamber surface fluxes ranged from 40 to 62 mmol m(-2) day(-1) for CO2 and were not detectable for CH4 (< 0.2 mmol m(-2) day(-1)). Lowest gaseous C concentrations and fluxes occurred at the driest site under high sea spray input, which was accompanied by a higher degree of decomposition. Isotope fractionation factors alpha(c) ranged from 1.047 to 1.077 and suggested a predominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The lower CH4 concentrations at one particular site may have been caused by a number of processes but isotope mass balances indicated a preferential loss of CH4 at all sites, especially at the site of lowest CH4 concentrations. Low CH4 concentrations were found under a high sea spray input and higher sulfate and reduced inorganic sulfur contents, suggesting a potential for attenuation of methanogenesis by sulfate reduction. All sites were characterized by very low Nickel concentrations of mostly < 15 nmol L-1 and low concentrations of other essential trace elements that may further inhibit methanogenesis but also methanotrophy. The Patagonian sites fell within the reported range of CO2 and CH4 concentrations and depth patterns, and isotopic composition of the gases at northern sites despite different vegetation composition and seemingly lower surface fluxes. Fairly high sulfate and low trace element concentrations due to differences in atmospheric deposition may locally modify the decomposition patterns.

AB Ecosystem exchanges of CO2 and CH4 were studied by chamber techniques in five different vegetation types in a high arctic valley at Zackenberg, NE Greenland. The vegetation types were categorized as Cassiope heath, hummocky fen, continuous fen, grass land and Salix arctica snowbed. Integrated daytime fluxes for the different vegetation types of the valley showed that the fen areas and the grassland, were significant sources of CH4 with a mean efflux of 6.3 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and sinks for CO2, with almost -170 mg CO2 m(-2) hr(-1). The heath and snowbed areas had much lower carbon sequestration rates of about -25 mg CO2 m(-2) hr(-1) and were also sinks for CH4. Methane emissions from the valley dominated in the hummocky fens. Computation of area integrated mean daytime flux values across all vegetation types of the entire valley bottom revealed that it was a sink of CO2 in the order of -96+/-33 mg CO2 m-2 hr-1 and a source of 1.9+/-0.7 m(-2) CH4 m(-2) hr(-1). These values were in accordance with eddy correlation measurements reported elsewhere in this issue and reflect a high-carbon exchange despite the high arctic location. In the fens, where the water table was at or above the soil surface, methane emissions increased with net ecosystem CO2 flux. In places with the water table below the soil surface, such as particularly in the hummocky parts of the fen, oxidation tended to become the dominant controlling factor on methane efflux.

SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Boggy soils occupy 23% of the Southern Forestry in the Central Forest State Biospheric Reserve but contain 44% of the total carbon stock in this territory, with 75-90% of the carbon accumulated in the organic horizons. Soil bogging reduces the rate of peat decomposition, which results in nutrient accumulation in the organic horizons. Under laboratory conditions, the rate of decomposition (mineralization) of peat horizons was significantly lower than that of organic horizons taken from nonswamped soils. At the same time, the rates of mineralization of straw added to peat and organic horizons were relatively similar. These data and results of field experiments on the decomposition of needle fall suggest that potential biological activity in the boggy soils is rather high, in spite of the low actual decomposition rate in the peat layers.

AB Upland peat soils in close proximity to urban and industrial areas can be contaminated with high concentrations of atmospherically deposited lead. The peat soils of the Peak District (UK) are characterised by extensive eroding gullies. Fine-resolution digital topographic data were used to map the extent and depth of these gullies. Peat samples from eroding gully walls and suspended sediments were collected and analysed for lead content. Variability in lead concentrations of gully wall material and suspended sediments can be explained by differences in mean upslope gully depth. The lead content of suspended sediment exported from catchments characterised by shallow peat gullies is higher than that exported from catchments with deep peat gullies. The empirical relationship between sediment-associated lead concentration and mean upslope gully depth was combined with the gully depth mapping to produce a predictive spatial model of suspended sediment lead concentrations across the Peak District. This model may be particularly useful for catchment managers who are currently involved in the restoration of eroding peat soils in the Peak District uplands. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Irrigation by jet-type sprinklers contributes to the spatial variability of substrate water content and growth of containerized white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss.] seedlings grown outdoors during their second growing season. Geostatistical analyses were used to identify the spatial structure of this variability throughout the growing season and to help develop a sampling strategy to facilitate irrigation management. Boundary line analysis confirmed that the heterogeneity of height growth is related to seasonal variations in substrate water content and that maximum height growth and seedling biomass is attained when average seasonal substrate water content is approximately 40% (v/v). Parameters estimated from semi-variograms, most notably the range (a) and total variance (C-0 + C-t) of substrate water content, can be used to define sampling strategies specific to irrigation management and morphophysiological evaluation of seedlings. The relationship between leaching and substrate water content can be used, in conjunction with kriged maps, to estimate potential losses of mineral nutrients and to quantify water use for the production of white spruce seedlings during their second growing season in a forest nursery. More than 15% of the seedlings in the crop used in the present study were rejected at delivery. Knowledge of the spatial variability within a crop enables forest nurserymen to modify sampling techniques and cultural practices, produce more uniform seedlings and reduce the quantity of seedlings that fail to meet morphophysiological criteria.

AB The objective of this article is to determine whether pollution trends can be reconstructed from sediments in the outer Gota alv estuary. Detailed interpretation of heavy metal profiles in the recent sediment,in combination with profiles of Pb-210- and Cs-137-activity, organic carbon content and grain size distribution, allows estimation of historical trends. This is based on the assumption that only certain intervals, which can be identified, are disturbed. The sediment data area compared with archive data on historical trends in emissions of heavy metals. Special attention is given to mercury, which shows high enrichment over long periods of time. It is found that the most polluted sediments were deposited between 1930 and 1980, but that episodic discharges have also occurred more recently Nevertheless, the effects of remediation since the 1970s are apparent.

AB Soil carbon in permafrost ecosystems has the potential to become a major positive feedback to climate change if permafrost thaw increases heterotrophic decomposition. However, warming can also stimulate autotrophic production leading to increased ecosystem carbon storage-a negative climate change feedback. Few studies partitioning ecosystem respiration examine decadal warming effects or compare responses among ecosystems. Here, we first examined how 11 years of warming during different seasons affected autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration in a bryophyte-dominated peatland in Abisko, Sweden. We used natural abundance radiocarbon to partition ecosystem respiration into autotrophic respiration, associated with production, and heterotrophic decomposition. Summertime warming decreased the age of carbon respired by the ecosystem due to increased proportional contributions from autotrophic and young soil respiration and decreased proportional contributions from old soil. Summertime warming's large effect was due to not only warmer air temperatures during the growing season, but also to warmer deep soils year-round. Second, we compared ecosystem respiration responses between two contrasting ecosystems, the Abisko peatland and a tussock-dominated tundra in Healy, Alaska. Each ecosystem had two different timescales of warming (<5years and over a decade). Despite the Abisko peatland having greater ecosystem respiration and larger contributions from heterotrophic respiration than the Healy tundra, both systems responded consistently to short- and long-term warming with increased respiration, increased autotrophic contributions to ecosystem respiration, and increased ratios of autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration. We did not detect an increase in old soil carbon losses with warming at either site. If increased autotrophic respiration is balanced by increased primary production, as is the case in the Healy tundra, warming will not cause these ecosystems to become growing season carbon sources. Warming instead causes a persistent shift from heterotrophic to more autotrophic control of the growing season carbon cycle in these carbon-rich permafrost ecosystems.

AB Combining peatland rewetting with biomass cropping (paludiculture) is one strategy to remove nutrientsurpluses from soil/water and stimulate peat-forming vegetation. This approach was tested in the Mas-saciuccoli Lake Basin (Tuscany, Italy), a coastal floodplain artificially drained for agricultural purposessince 1930, where land reclamation and continuous cropping have contributed to considerable peatdegradation and water eutrophication due to nutrient enrichment of surface waters. An experimentaltrial was established in spring 2012 with three perennial rhizomatous grasses (PRG) (Phragmites aus-tralis, Miscanthus X giganteus, Arundo donax) and two woody species managed as short-rotation coppice(SRC) (Salix alba Dimitrios, Populus X canadensis Oudenberg), aimed to provide biomass for variousbioenergy supply chains. A conventionally cultivated annual crop (maize) was the control. The aim of thisstudy was to compare the sustainability of the proposed paludiculture systems to that of conventionalannual crops on the basis of yield and nutrient-removal capability. This two-year field study evaluatedyields, nutrient concentrations and uptake (N and P) of the crops. Over the two years, A. donax had thehighest mean biomass yield (35 Mg ha(-1)), N uptake (367 kg ha(-1)), and P uptake (54 kg ha(-1)). SRCs hadthe lowest nutrient uptake in both years. Among grasses, the highest N concentration was recorded inA. donax leaves in 2013 (N: 2.41%), while P concentration was greater in S. alba branches (P: 0.39%). Theaverage aboveground biomass of maize was 17.5 Mg ha(-1), while the nutrient uptakes were equal to 194and 27 kg ha(-1)for N and P, respectively.
   Thus, the performances of paludiculture systems were generally encouraging and could represent animportant alternative for restoring and managing former drained peatlands in a suitable product chain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It has been claimed that geographical variability could alter conclusions from some studies examining the impacts of prescribed moorland burning, including the Effects of Moorland Burning on the Ecohydrology of River basins (EMBER) project. We provide multiple lines of evidence, including additional analyses, to refute these claims. In addition, new findings from EMBER study catchments highlight previously unconsidered issues of burning adjacent to and over watercourses, contrary to guidelines. A systematic review confirms the EMBER conclusions are in line with the majority of published UK studies on responses to prescribed burning ofSphagnumgrowth/abundance, soil properties, hydrological change and both peat exposure and erosion. From this review, we identify an association between sponsor identity and some recent research conclusions related to moorland burning. This additional variable, which has not previously been incorporated into moorland burning policy debates, should be given greater consideration when evidence is being evaluated. We also show that sponsorship and other perceived conflicts of interest were not declared on a recent publication that criticized the EMBER project. Policy implications. Effects of Moorland Burning on the Ecohydrology of River basins (EMBER) findings still suggest multiple environmental impacts associated with prescribed vegetation burning on peatland. Non-compliance with guidelines for heather burning alongside/over watercourses merits closer attention. Policy communities might need to consider potential influences associated with funder identity when evaluating studies.

AB Nitrogen (N) loads from municipal and mine wastewater discharges typically increase N concentrations in recipient water bodies which should get more attention especially in cold-climate regions. This study compared N removal efficiency of six constructed wetlands (CWs) treating mine waters and three CWs polishing municipal wastewater. There were clear impacts of point source N loading to recipient water bodies in all cases studied and >300-fold increase in N was seen in some cases. First-order N removal coefficient was determined for seven of these CWs. All CWs studied were observed to remove N efficiently during the warm growing season but the amount of N released increased significantly during the cold season. Although some year-round purification was achieved by both peat-based and pond-type CWs, removal of nitrate + nitrite-N((NO3- + NO2-)-N) was low during winter. The first-order N removal coefficient varied from 4.9 . 10(-6) to 1.9 . 10(-3) d(-1) and showed that peat-based CWs were slightly more efficient in N removal than pond-type CWs. However, purification efficiency was steadier and higher for pond-type CWs, as lower hydraulic load or longer water residence time compensated for purification performance. Pond-type CWs showed mean removal efficiency of 59% and 46% for ammonium-N (NH4+-N) and (NO3- + NO2-)-N, respectively, whereas peatland-type CWs had lower removal efficiency for NH4+-N (mean of 26%) and in many cases negative removal for (NO3- + NO2-)-N. Correlation analysis revealed no clear, systematic relationship between temperature and N removal. However, in some CWs the highest correlation was between temperature and (NO3- + NO2-)-N, reflecting lower denitrification rate at lower temperature. More than 50% removal was found to require a hydraulic load below 10 mm d(-1). In order to achieve 70% of NH4+-N removal, N-tot load lower than 75 g m(-2) year(-1) and a residence time longer than 80 d are needed in CWs in cold-climate regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The objective was to assess the net CO2 balance on a daily basis during the crucial time of the fen turning from a net sink to a net source of CO2. A clear decline in the CO2 fluxes was observed due to the senescence of the vascular plants at the end of August. The hourly median of daytime fluxes decreased from -0.12 to -0.04 mg m(-2) s(-1) from August to September. The nighttime fluxes decreased simultaneously from 0.07 to 0.04 mg m(-2) s(-1). A simple photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) driven net ecosystem exchange model was used to patch up the time series for calculating the diurnal balances. The value of the model parameter of maximal gross photosynthetic uptake changed from -0.320 to -0.134 mg m(-2) s(-1) from August to September. The value of alpha (initial slope of net ecosystem exchange versus PAR) changed, correspondingly, from -0.888 to -0.480 mu g mu mol(-1). The highest negative daily balances at the beginning of the period were about -2 g m(-2) d(-1). During the first days of September they rose to 3 g m(-2) d(-1), but decreased to 1 g m(-2) d(-1) at the end of the measurements.

AB Secondary effluent from the Drummond, WI wastewater stabilization lagoon system was applied to an acidic, nutrient-poor, 8.3-ha peatland for the purpose of advanced wastewater treatment. Application occurred from June through October at an average rate of 10 cm yr(-1) from 1979 to 1982, 24 cm yr(-1) from 1983 to 1988, and 40 cm yr(-1) from 1989 to 1996, increasing surface flow from the application area by 47,78, and 154%, respectively. The pH of the peatland outflow increased from 4.2 to 6.7, chloride rose from 1.1 mg L-1 to 80 mg L-1, and total phosphorus increased from 0.05 mg L-1 to 0.6 mg L-1 Because raw sewage input was only one-half of the lagoon system's design capacity, the lagoons provided a high degree of sewage treatment, removing 95% of suspended solids (SS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and nitrogen from the wastewater stream. Phosphorus removal in the lagoons, which was 98% in the first years of operation, declined to 85% by 1995. The peatland contributed little additional treatment, removing only 37% of the nitrogen and 17% of the phosphorus remaining in the lagoon effluent. The peatland's capacity to retain phosphorus was exhausted after a few years of application. Increased pH, nutrient availability, and water levels altered the peatland vegetation community. The Sphagnum ground cover was reduced or eliminated in many places, and dense stands of cattail (Typha sp,) developed in some areas. Small peatlands such as this one seem poor candidates for use as tertiary treatment systems.

AB In ombrotrophic peatlands, the moisture content of the vadose zone (acrotelm) controls oxygen diffusion rates, redox state, and the turnover of organic matter. Whether peatlands act as sinks or sources of atmospheric carbon thus relies on variably saturated flow processes. The Richards equation is the standard model for water flow in soils, but it is not clear whether it can be applied to simulate water flow in live Sphagnum moss. Transient laboratory evaporation experiments were conducted to observe evaporative water fluxes in the acrotelm, containing living Sphagnum moss, and a deeper layer containing decomposed moss peat. The experimental data were evaluated by inverse modeling using the Richards equation as process model for variably-saturated flow. It was tested whether water fluxes and time series of measured pressure heads during evaporation could be simulated. The results showed that the measurements could be matched very well providing the hydraulic properties are represented by a suitable model. For this, a trimodal parametrization of the underlying pore-size distribution was necessary which reflects three distinct pore systems of the Sphagnum constituted by inter-, intra-, and inner-plant water. While the traditional van Genuchten-Mualem model led to great discrepancies, the physically more comprehensive Peters-Durner-Iden model which accounts for capillary and noncapillary flow, led to a more consistent description of the observations. We conclude that the Richards equation is a valid process description for variably saturated moisture fluxes over a wide pressure range in peatlands supporting the conceptualization of the live moss as part of the vadose zone.

AB The physicochemical and adsorptive properties of a carbon sorbent obtained by the microwave carbonization of peat were studied. With the use of IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, it was found that, under the action of microwave radiation, the concentration of functional groups in peat decreased and, as a result, the carbon content of peat increased. It was established that the adsorption activity of the carbon sorbent for iodine considerably increased as a result of carbonization, and that for methylene blue and methanyl yellow decreased. The carbon sorbents obtained by the microwave carbonization of peat had a total pore volume of 1.02 cm(3)/g and a specific surface area of no smaller than 1350 m(2)/g.

AB We set out to test the ability to detect vegetation change from organic soil nutrient (carbon and nitrogen) composition in the fire-determined forest/non-forest mosaic of western Tasmania, Australia. We find no relationship between organic soil nitrogen and carbon content, despite widely varying local vegetation and fire regimes. Pollen evidence supports the role of fire in driving an initial vegetation state change from forest to non-forest, while carbon and nitrogen analysis of the peat section suggest that factors other than peat nutrient (carbon and nitrogen) content are responsible for the observed meta-stability of non-forest at the site for 7000years. We find that we cannot validate the use of organic soil nitrogen and carbon content for inferring vegetation type and question the degree of post-European vegetation change inferred from this method.

AB This review presents an analysis of literature data and original studies by the authors aimed at revealing the factors inhibiting the destruction of high-moor (oligotrophic) peat. Each of the ecological factors that prevent the decomposition of the high-moor peat by different groups of microorganisms is considered. The acid reaction, low temperatures, and lack of nutrients were found not to be the primary factors inhibiting the destruction of the peat. The limited content of oxygen in the peatbogs leads to a drastic decrease in the number of mycelial microorganisms and a reduction of the activity of hydrolytic and oxidizing enzymes. The main factor inhibiting the decomposition of sphagnum is its mechanical and chemical stability, since animals crushing sphagnum are absent in the soil, and this moss has polysaccharides of special composition. The toxicity of phenol compounds, which is manifested under the aerobic conditions, prevents the activity of all the hydrolytic enzymes. This is the main reason for the slow decomposition of sphagnum peat and the long-term preservation of the residues of bodies and food in high-moor peatlands.

AB Northern peatlands sequester carbon and emit methane, and thus have both cooling and warming impacts on the climate system through their influence on atmospheric burdens of CO2 and CH4. These competing impacts are usually compared by the global warming potential (GWP) methodology, which determines the equivalent CO2 annual emission that would have the same integrated radiative forcing impact over a chosen time horizon as the annual CH4 emission. We use a simple model of CH4 and CO2 pools in the atmosphere to extend this analysis to quantify the dynamics, over years to millennia, of the net radiative forcing impact of a peatland that continuously emits CH4 and sequesters C. We find that for observed ratios of CH4 emission to C sequestration (roughly 0.1-2 mol mol(-1)), the radiative forcing impact of a northern peatland begins, at peatland formation, as a net warming that peaks after about 50 years, remains a diminishing net warming for the next several hundred to several thousand years, depending on the rate of C sequestration, and thereafter is or will be an ever increasing net cooling impact. We then use the model to evaluate the radiative forcing impact of various changes in CH4 and/or CO2 emissions. In all cases, the impact of a change in CH4 emissions dominates the radiative forcing impact in the first few decades, and then the impact of the change in CO2 emissions slowly exerts its influence.

AB Our primary objective was to develop an understanding of the geomorphic evolution of Whiteoak Bottoms (WOB), a peatland along the Nantahala River in the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains (SBRM) of western North Carolina. Radiocarbon dates directly above basal fluvial sediments returned ages of 14,000 to 15,000 cal yr BP. These ages indicate WOB is the oldest dated peatland in the SBRM and that such wetlands have persisted throughout the Holocene. Below the relatively flat surface of the wetland, paleochannels, similar to those of the modern channel, were found; suggesting a persistence of similar channel morphology since the terminal Pleistocene. The wetland's stratigraphy reveals a consistent pattern with basal fluvial cobbles being overlain by sandy channel-fill grading up into peat. Two different distinct inorganic deposits separate the lower organic deposits from the sapric peat deposits at the surface. Interestingly, we estimate more than 56% of the organic matter preserved by the wetland accumulated during the first 6,000 years of development. Overall, WOB has accumulated approximately 424 Mg/ ha of carbon during the past 15,000 years. Maintenance of this wetland initially depended on the Nantahala River; however, today it is ground water and beavers that allows for the persistence of this rare landscape.

DE Sphagnum species; neutralization requirement; pH drift
AB Variations in moss peat cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation (BS) can result in inconsistent initial pH in moss peat-based substrates created using standard formulas for limestone additions and can lead to subsequent drift from the initial pH in those substrates. This study was conducted to determine the extent of such variation. CEC and BS were measured in three replications on 64 moss peat samples that were selected from three mires across Alberta, Canada, to represent maximum gradients in plant species composition within six degrees of decomposition acceptable for professional peat-based substrates. CEC ranged from 108 to 162 cmol center dot kg(-1) (meq center dot 100 g). Averaged overall samples, BS ranged from 15% to 71% of CEC and calcium accounted for 68%, magnesium for 25%, sodium for 5%, and potassium for 1.4% of BS. CEC was positively correlated to the amount of Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klingrr. in the sample (r = 0.22). BS was positively correlated to the amount of sedge (r = 0.28). Neither CEC nor BS was influenced by degree of decomposition (r = 0.002 and r = 0.08, respectively). Moss peats with high CEC have a greater buffering capacity than those with low CEC, resulting in less pH drift. Moss peats with high BS should have a low neutralization requirement to achieve a target pH. Understanding the species composition in peat-based substrates can alleviate problems of inconsistent initial pH and subsequent pH drift.

AB Holocene climate records from northern Europe improve our understanding of important North Atlantic ocean and atmospheric circulation systems to long-term insolation-driven changes, as well as more rapid forcing and feedback mechanisms. Here we assess Holocene climate and environmental changes in northern Norway based on the analysis of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, and plant wax biomarkers from a high latitude ombrotrophic bog. We define the extent and thickness of Hollabattjonnen Bog (0.16 km(2)), which is located 10 km north of Tromso. Several cores were analyzed, including a 5.16-m core that spans the last 9.5 cal ka BP. Vegetation changes from several sites were reconstructed and the distribution and hydrogen isotopic composition (delta D) ofn-alkanes (C-21-C-33) were analyzed. Our data show several distinct climate intervals that primarily indicate changes in bog surface moisture. In the early Holocene (c. 9.5-7.7 cal ka BP), wetter conditions are defined by the presence of wetland sedges and grasses, higher concentrations of mid-chain lengthn-alkanes, and a similarity in delta D values among homologs. A dry mid-Holocene (c. 7.7-3.8 cal ka BP) is inferred from the presence of a heath shrubland, low peat accumulations rates, and significant differences between delta D values of mid- and long-chain lengthn-alkanes. The late Holocene (c. 3.8 cal ka BP-present) is marked by the onset of wetter conditions, lateral bog expansion, and an increase in sedges and grasses. The Hollabattjonnen Bog record is also significant because its margins were an important location for human settlement. We correlate early Holocene environmental conditions with changes in Stone Age structures recently excavated, and we identify the occurrence of coprophilous fungi, such asSporormiellaandSordaria, likely associated with reindeer grazing activity beginning c. 1 cal ka BP. This site therefore provides important regional paleoclimate information as well as context for evaluating local prehistoric human-environment interactions.

AB Charcoal is abundant in various soils and soil sediments and is basically the result of either natural wildfires or of anthropogenic ignition. Compositions of charcoal assemblages are the result of several taphonomical processes. Beside this, little is known about the influence of charcoal from anthropogenic origin, like charcoal production sites (kiln sites) on soil charcoal assemblages. To elucidate how human charcoal production as well as erosion of the relicts of kiln sites influenced charcoal assemblages in soils and mires, a multi-proxy approach was applied at two transects on the Renneckenberg, a steep slope in the low mountain range Harz, Germany. On this slope, three types of archives (soil/soil sediments, kiln sites and peatland) were investigated each with different methods on a local scale (soil charcoal analyses, kiln site charcoal analyses, peat macro-/micro-charcoal and pollen analysis). The kiln site charcoal records are taxonomically richer in wood taxa than those from colluvial assemblages, especially regarding deciduous tree species. Fagus sylvatica and Acer sp. are rare or absent in the colluvial charcoal assemblages which are dominated by Picea charcoal. At the bottom of the slope, the soil charcoal concentration is very high and indicates strong erosion of charcoal from the upper part of the slope. Significant taxonomical discrepancies between the colluvial and the kiln site charcoal assemblages may be related to different fire intensity throughout the Holocene and to human woodland usage. Additionally, changes in the run-off intensity and fire frequency are detected in the peat macro-charcoal record reflecting vegetation change in the early Holocene. The micro-charcoal content coincides with the main mining phases in the late Holocene and the 9.2 k climatic anomaly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing (RS) data may play an important role in the development of cost-effective means for modelling, mapping, planning and conserving biodiversity. Specifically, at the landscape scale, spatial models for the occurrences of species of conservation concern may be improved by the inclusion of RS-based predictors, to help managers to better meet different conservation challenges. In this study, we examine whether predicted distributions of 28 red-listed plant species in north-eastern Finland at the resolution of 25 ha are improved when advanced RS-variables are included as unclassified continuous predictor variables, in addition to more commonly used climate and topography variables. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we studied whether the spatial predictions of the distribution of red-listed plant species in boreal landscapes are improved by incorporating advanced RS (normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference soil index and Tasseled Cap transformations) information into species-environment models. Models were fitted using three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) climate-topography only; (2) remote sensing only; and (3) combined climate-topography and remote sensing variables, and evaluated by four-fold cross-validation with the area under the curve (AUC) statistics. The inclusion of RS variables improved both the explanatory power (on average 8.1 % improvement) and cross-validation performance (2.5 %) of the models. Hybrid models produced ecologically more reliable distribution maps than models using only climate-topography variables, especially for mire and shore species. In conclusion, Landsat ETM+ data integrated with climate and topographical information has the potential to improve biodiversity and rarity assessments in northern landscapes, especially in predictive studies covering extensive and remote areas.

AB Miocene alluvial and fluvial-lacustrine deposits comprising three lignite successions (Lower, Middle. and Upper) are exposed in the Soma coalfield in Western Anatolia. The total thickness of the coal successions is about 900 m and they rest unconformably on Mesozoic carbonate and siliciclastic basement rocks. Several lithofacies are recognised and are arranged into 15 facies assemblages (FA1 to FA15) within coal successions. The Lower Coal succession (FA1 to FA3) has been interpreted as the deposits of alluvial fan to ephemeral lacustrine and forest lower mire system, resulting in a subbituminous coal, which averages thickness of 20 m. The freshwater carbonate-dominated Middle Coal succession (FA4 to FA7) has been interpreted as the deposits of an anastomosed river system including shallow carbonate mudflats to lake and ponds and frequently drying poor forest mires depositing lignitic coal. The volcanic-influenced Upper Coal (UC) succession (FA8 to FA15) has been interpreted as the fluvial channel, floodplain, and allochthonous peat mire deposits (FA8 to FA10) associated with a braided river system that was rapidly buried and eroded by volcaniclastic apron deposits (FA11 to FA 14) and culminated in large carbonate-dominated shallow lake deposits (FA 15). The Miocene coal successions were probably deposited in a slowly subsiding and fault-controlled karst-based paleovalley and lowlands of the intramontane paleomorphology that resulted from the Early Tertiary collision of the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.

AB Peat moss in drained peatlands has become a non-negligible source of greenhouse gases (GHG) emission. Pyrolysis is a potential technique to convert carbon-emitting peat moss to carbon-storage materials. This work investigates the behavior of peat moss pyrolysis by a combined in-situ thermal analysis and bench-scale pyrolysis experiment methodology. The simultaneous thermal analyzer, which provides the simultaneous TG/DTA analysis, was employed to reveal the thermal decomposition behavior of peat moss. The samples were heated up to 900 degrees C with different heating rates of 10, 15, and 20 degrees C/min. Thereafter, pyrolysis experiments with peak temperatures of 450, 500, 550 and 600 degrees C were performed in a bench-scale pyrolyzer. It was found that there are four main stages and two micro stages of mass loss during peat moss pyrolysis from room temperature to 900 degrees C. Also, kinetic parameters were calculated based on the results of TG and DTG by the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method and the Coats-Redfern (CR) method. In the bench-scale pyrolysis experiments, four phases, i.e., char, tar, aqueous phase, and gas, were obtained and characterized. The carbon distribution and the GHG emission from peat moss pyrolysis were determined.

AB The nutrients removed from the forest when branches and tree tops are harvested for fuel can be returned to the site by bringing back the wood-ash from the burning. In Sweden, this compensation measure is not carried out to any appreciable extent, mostly because there is no economic incentive to the landowner. The ash contains all the elements required for tree growth except for nitrogen (N), the most important element limiting growth on mineral soils. Since ash, so far, is brought back only to mineral soils, increased forest growth cannot be expected. In contrast, for organic soils, N is often abundant whereas the amounts of other mineral nutrients in peat are small. This means that the peatland forests provide an opportunity for ash amendment in order to increase forest production. Old fertilization trials using wood-ash show that the growth increase can be very large. The aims of this study were (i) to calculate the area of peat-covered land that, with respect to stand growth responses, could be regarded as most suitable for biofuel ash (wood-ash and peat-ash) fertilization and (ii) to assess the amount of biofuel ash needed for fertilizing this area.
   Most of the area calculations were based on data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (SNFI) 1997-2001. Sites were selected using existing knowledge about ash fertilization effects on tree growth and with the aid of registrations made in SNFI regarding peat thickness, site productivity, drainage, condition of drains, dominating field vegetation, and stage of stand development. Additional calculations were made to estimate the area of abandoned peat harvesting fields ready for after-use by afforestation.
   According to the selection criteria used, the most suitable sites for biofuel ash fertilization are drained, mid-rotation or old peatland forests where the field vegetation is dominated by shrubs or low sedge plants indicative of medium-low site productivity. The selected area comprises 190,000 ha. Most are located in North and North Central Sweden (90,000 ha), whereas South Central and South Sweden accounted for 30,000 and 70,000 ha, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). To these areas, 2000-3000 ha of abandoned peat fields ready for afforestation should be available within a period of about 5 years.
   The present annual production of biofuel ash in Sweden, of acceptable quality for forest fertilization, is 250,000300,000 tonnes. If it were desired to fertilize all the sites (190,000 ha) identified in this study with 5000 kg per ha, it would require 3-4 years of the current annual production of bio-ash. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB We studied a Great Lakes peatland protected by a barrier dune system to test the hypothesis that changes in the morphology of a barrier beach alter the wetland surface-water and ground-water hydrology such that the plant rooting zone in the wetland interior might be affected. Hydraulic head measured in observation wells located on transects perpendicular to a flow-through channel, uplands, and Lake Ontario were compared to lake-level changes, weather patterns, and the temporal conditions of the barrier beach. Water-table elevations within the wetland complex always remained 0.35 to 0.84 m above Lake Ontario's water level (mean difference = 0.62 m) and did not fluctuate in parallel with changes in the lake's water level. Flooding events occurred when breaches closed and isolated the wetland complex from Lake Ontario; daily average water levels rose between 0.06 m and 0.27 m. When the barrier beach was breached naturally or by human activity, daily average water-table elevations in the wetland receded between 0.16 m and 0.41 m. During the growing season, vertical ground-water-flow directions also changed as a function of changing hydraulics controlled by the barrier beach. Vertical recharge-discharge gradients ranged from -0.2 to 0.1 m.m(-1). Water-table elevation and hydraulic head gradients across the study area were controlled primarily by short-term (days to weeks) changes in shoreline geomorphology, whereas seasonal weather patterns and Lake Ontario water-level fluctuations imposed secondary controls on the ground-water-flow regime.

AB Saline boreal fens represent potential models for post-mining landscape reclamation in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (Canada) where wetland construction is challenged by salinization. One of the key indicators of reclamation success is the accumulation of organic matter within constructed fens. Thus, a better understanding of the linkages between salt content and organic matter storage in saline boreal fens can be useful for advancing fen construction in this region. As such, this study investigates how salinity fluctuations estimated by diatom-based transfer functions, coupled with changes in hydrological conditions and vegetation inferred from macrofossils have influenced organic matter accumulation rates (OMAR) over the last similar to 100 years in open-water areas (ponds) within a saline boreal fen near Fort McMurray, Alberta. Median OMAR (181 g m(-2) yr(-1)) of the site suggests that the ponds situated within saline boreal fens can accumulate organic matter at a rate comparable to freshwater boreal and subarctic ponds, and the estimated salinity levels (3-21 ppt) did not severely affect organic matter accumulation. Strong significant positive (Lager Pond), strong significant negative (South Pond), and weak insignificant (Pilsner Pond) correlations between OMAR and diatom-inferred salinity were observed, suggesting that relations between organic matter accumulation and salt content are not straightforward, and salinity was not the main control on OMAR. Macrofossil data showed that organic matter accumulation has been mainly driven by water level, type of primary producers and pond regime. OMAR was the highest during the transition from peatland to ponds due to low decomposition rates resulting from high inputs of relatively resistant plant litter, and anoxic conditions.

AB Stocks of organic carbon in the northeast of Sakhalin Island average 109.8 kg/m(2) in medium-deep oligotrophic peat soils, 75.8 kg/m(2) in oligotrophic peat gley soils, 20.9-42.7 kg/m(2) in peat gleyzems, and 16.6 kg/m(2) in gleyzems. The vertical distribution of volumetric concentrations and the carbon stocks in different subtypes of peat soils and gleyzems have been studied. Linear regression equations have been developed to estimate carbon stocks in dependence on the depth of the peat layer. The coefficients of variation of the carbon stocks on test plots of 50 x 50 m in size increase in the following order: medium-deep oligotrophic peat soils (3.1-7.3%) < oligotrophic peat gley soils (3.3-12.9%) < peat gleyzems (9.2-21.7%) < gleyzems (22.9%). The proportion of the carbon stock variances has been estimated for three spatial scales (50 x 50 m, 5 x 5 km, and 10 x 10 km) with the use of the hierarchical analysis of variance. The required number of sampled profiles for reliable data on the mean carbon stocks in peat soils and gleyzems has been estimated. Nomograms for determining the least significant difference between the estimates of the mean soil carbon stocks have been proposed for studies with a small number of samples.

AB From the Sellevollmyra bog at Andoya, northern Norway, a 440-cm long peat core covering the last c. 7000 calendar years was examined for humification, loss-on-ignition, microfossils, macrofossils and tephra. The age model was based on a Bayesian wiggle-match of 35 C-14 dates and two historically anchored tephra layers. Based on changes in lithology and biostratigraphical climate proxies, several climatic changes were identified ( periods of the most fundamental changes in italics): 6410-6380, 6230-6050, 5730-5640, 5470-5430, 5340-5310, 5270-5100, 4790-4710, 4890-4820, 4380-4320, 4220-4120, 4000-3810, 3610-3580, 3370-3340 ( regionally 2850-2750; in Sellevollmyra a hiatus between 2960-2520), 2330-2220, 1950, 1530-1450, 1150-840, 730? and c. 600? cal. yr BP. Most of these climate changes are known from other investigations of different palaeoclimate proxies in northern and middle Europe. Some volcanic eruptions seemingly coincide with vegetation changes recorded in the peat, e.g. about 5760 cal. yr BP; however, the known climatic deterioration at the time of the Hekla-4 tephra layer started some decades before the eruption event.

AB [1] The seasonal and interannual variation in the energy fluxes of a West Siberian continental bog were measured from April to October in 1999 and 2000 using the eddy covariance method. The energy balance closure rate (=[ sensible + latent heat fluxes]/ [ available energy]) ranged from similar to 0.8 to 0.9 and showed a better energy balance and less scattering using the soil heat flux estimated from an area-averaged soil thermal parameter rather than from a plot-based measurement. The net radiation (R-n) increased drastically after snowmelt because the surface albedo (a) dropped from its highest value to its lowest value over the course of the snowmelt. The snowmelt water raised the water table (z(wt)) to its highest level; it then gradually decreased. The seasonal and interannual variation in a, which ranged from 0.09 - 0.19, depended on z(wt), because surface wetness was closely related to zwt through the capillary uptake of Sphagnum moss. The seasonal variation in the latent heat flux ( lE) was similar to that in R-n. The largest lE was observed in the middle of June, and was similar to 120 Wm(-2) (4.2 mm d(-1)) in both years. Conversely, the sensible heat flux ( H) did not show an obvious seasonal pattern and was lower than lE during the growing season. The Bowen ratio (B-r) in the early growing season was 0.57 and 0.60, and the values in the peak growing season were 0.65 and 0.78, in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The lower B-r was related to the higher z(wt); specifically, it was due to the wetter surface conditions. An interannual comparison of the monthly mean atmospheric water vapor deficit (deltae) and lE showed a significant relationship with a higher lE observed in the year with a higher deltae. Therefore in the bog studied the interannual variation in the water vapor flux was controlled mainly by z(wt) and deltae.

AB Depth to water table (DWT, the depth from the water surface to the top of the peat surface) is one of the most important environmental variables related to the habitat types and distribution of vegetation within a subalpine peatland. The distribution of phytolith assemblages and basic environmental data from 43 surface soil samples with significant ecological and hydrological gradients were investigated to generate transfer functions for quantitative reconstruction of paleoenvironmental changes in Dajiuhu peatland, central China. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were employed to explore the relationship between main environmental variables and phytolith morphotypes and distributions. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of phytoliths was significantly correlated with the DWT (25% variance), total organic carbon (TOC, 10% variance) and magnetic susceptibility (chi, 7% variance). We established the transfer functions for the significant variables based on modern analogue technique (MAT), weighted averaging techniques (WA) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS), and model performance was assessed using bootstrap cross-validation. The high correspondence of the predicted DWT results based on phytolith-environment calibration data with observed data reflects that the phytolith-based WA-PLS is a reliable effective calibration method for the quantitative DWT reconstruction of ombrotrophic (rain-fed) subalpine peatland.

AB This study investigated the relationship between altitude and Cs-137 fallout in soils and plants.  The soils and plants, Calluna vulgaris, Erica cinerea and Molinia caerulea, were sampled across a transect of two valleys in north-western Ireland.  The results provided evidence that greater Cs-137 deposition to soils occurred at higher altitudes, and the data supported the findings of a previous investigation in the same area.  A valley effect, whereby greater concentrations of Cs-137 accumulated in plants on the lower altitudes of the valley floors, was shown to be significant.  Deposition values for total Cs-137 in soils were not correlated with plant concentrations, although a relationship between concentrations in C. vulgaris and M. caerulea was found to be statistically significant.  No relationship was observed between the Cs-137 from weapons fallout with that of Chernobyl origin in the 0-10 cm depth soils, although a significant correlation emerged between the same two components measured in C. vulgaris.  The results suggest that existing definitions of concentration ratios and transfer factors are, for many reasons, inappropriate for studies of soil to plant transfer of Cs-137 in peatland ecosystems.

AB Extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) in soils play a pivotal role in ecosystem processes, such as organic carbon (C) decomposition or nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization. Thus, EEA measurements can provide insights into the rates of ecosystem-level processes in peatlands, which will experience more frequent extreme droughts in the future. In the present study, the activities of seven hydrolases and two oxidases involved in the acquisition of C, N, and P were measured in response to simulated extreme drought events during the summer. The combined results of three consecutive years showed that the beta-1,4-glucosidase and beta-1,4-xylosidase involved in mediating labile-C decomposition increased by 102.63% and 100.63%, respectively. In contrast, the oxidases involved in mediating recalcitrant-C decomposition showed a non-significant decreasing trend, indicating that extreme drought significantly increased the decomposition of cellulose in peatlands. The C-acquisition enzyme, C:P -acquisition enzyme, and N:P-acquisition enzyme activities increased, on average, by 78.45%, 51.57%, and 36.57%, respectively, under extreme drought, impacting the rates of microbial growth and organic matter depolymerization. In addition, the results showed that changes in the C-acquisition enzyme were correlated with shifts in the soil water content, whereas soil oxidases were correlated with soil total C and N contents. Overall, the soil total C content explained 41.9% of the variation in EEA and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry. These results provide an improved understanding of hydrolase and oxidase activities in response to extreme drought events, thereby facilitating the prediction of long-term C dynamics in peatlands.

The total soil organic carbon content, based on the dominant soil series and dominant land cover type, is estimated to be 2773 x 10(6) t C. Scotland has 84 929 1 x 1 km squares, of which 82 420 have a nominated dominant soil series. The total soil organic carbon content is estimated to be 19 011 x 10(6) t C, 6.85 times the total organic carbon content of the soil of England and Wales. The total organic carbon content of the soil of Great Britain is estimated to be 21 784 x 10(6) t C, of which 87% is in Scottish soils and 75% is in Scottish peats.
   A map of the mean soil organic carbon content of 10 x 10 km squares of the National Grid using classes of equal range illustrates the narrow range of organic carbon contents of the soils of England and Wales and the dominance of organic carbon in Scottish soils. A map using the same data, but with classes of unequal ranges increasing in size with increasing carbon content, is better for showing detailed differences within England and Wales.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle due to the high carbon storage in the substrate. Ecosystem production depends, for example, on the solar energy amount that reaches the vegetation, however the diffuse component of this flux can substantially increase ecosystem net productivity. This phenomenon is observed in different ecosystems, but the study of the atmosphere optical properties on peatland production is lacking. In this paper, the presented methodology allowed us to disentangle the diffuse radiation impact on the net ecosystem production (NEP) of Rzecin peatland, Poland. It allowed us to assess the impact of the atmospheric scattering process determined by the aerosol presence in the air mass. An application of atmospheric radiation transfer (ART) and ecosystem production (EP) models showed that the increase of aerosol optical thickness from 0.09 to 0.17 caused NEP to rise by 3.4-5.7%. An increase of the diffusion index (DI) by 0.1 resulted in an NEP increase of 6.1-42.3%, while a DI decrease of 0.1 determined an NEP reduction of -49.0 to -10.5%. These results show that low peatland vegetation responds to changes in light scattering. This phenomenon should be taken into account when calculating the global CO2 uptake estimation of such ecosystems.

AB Fungicides applied before harvest were evaluated to control postharvest gray mold of table grapes, caused by Botrlytis cinerea. The concentrations of thiophanate methyl (THM), iprodione (IPR). cyprodinil (CYP), pyraclostrobin + boscalid (PS+BO), pyrimethanil (PYR), or fen-hexamid (FEN) that inhibited the growth of four isolates sensitive to these fungicides by 50% (EC50) were 12.4, 2.5, 0.61. 0.29/0.577 0.26, or 0.17 mg liter(-1), respectively. THM, IPR, CYP, PS+BO, PYR, or FEN were applied to detached 'Thompson Seedless' berries at the equivalent of the maximum approved rates of 600, 500, 270. 59/116, 370, or 290 mg liter(-1), respectively. The berries were inoculated with B. cinerea 48 or 24 h before treatment or 24 or 48 h after treatment. Gray mold 2 weeks after treatment and storage at 15 degrees C was lowest after FEN application, followed by PYR, CYP, IPR, PS+BO, and THM. In commercial vineyards, one application of FEN, PYR, CYP, or PS+BO 2 weeks before harvest reduced postharvest gray mold by approximately 50%. When fungicides were applied repeatedly after berry set either in mixtures or alternated with fungicides of different mode of action classes, postharvest gray mold was reduced by about 50% using a commercial air-blast sprayer and by 70 to 87% using a hand-held sprayer that was directed into the clusters. The fungicide sensitivity of isolates collected in numerous vineyards indicated those with reduced sensitivity to all of the tested fungicides, except FEN, were common. The efficacy of preharvest fungicide regimes was not sufficient to replace postharvest sulfur dioxide fumigation.

AB Climate-induced changes in vegetation phenology at northern latitudes are still poorly understood. Continued monitoring and research are therefore needed to improve the understanding of abiotic drivers. Here we used 14 years of time lapse imagery and climate data from high-Arctic Northeast Greenland to assess the seasonal response of a dwarf shrub heath, grassland, and fen, to inter-annual variation in snow-cover, soil moisture, and air and soil temperatures. A late snowmelt and start of growing season is counterbalanced by a fast greenup and a tendency to higher peak greenness values. Snow water equivalents and soil moisture explained up to 77% of growing season duration and senescence phase, highlighting thatwater availability is a prominent driver in the heath site, rather than temperatures. We found a significant advance in the start of spring by 10 days and in the end of fall by 11 days, resulting in an unchanged growing season length. Vegetation greenness, derived from the imagery, was correlated to primary productivity, showing that the imagery holds valuable information on vegetation productivity.

AB Boreal peatlands represent a significant global store of soil carbon, which are subject to increasing natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Wildfire is the single largest disturbance to boreal forest and wetlands annually. Critical to the long-term carbon storage function in peatlands is the (re-)establishment of a near-surface water table following wildfire. This has been recently shown to in part be facilitated by post-fire reductions in water losses via evapotranspiration (ET). However, reduced ET may also have cascade impacts on other ecohydrological processes in recovering peatlands, such as a reduction in carbon sequestration. To investigate the linked cycles of evaporative loss and carbon exchange in burned peatlands, the burned and unburned peatlands in Alberta, Canada, were instrumented with eddy covariance systems to monitor continuous fluxes of energy, carbon dioxide, and water vapour, over two summer seasons (2013 and 2014; 2-3 years post-burn). The burned site showed significant changes to respiration and productivity and a shift in the partitioning of available energy (significantly larger Bowen ratio; mean values of 1.19 and 1.10 at the burned and unburned sites, respectively), as well as a significant reduction in ET rates. Decreases in respiration did not offset the decrease in primary productivity, and the burned site was significantly less productive than the reference site on a net production basis for the available data period. This provides direct observations of ET and CO2 fluxes at a novel ecosystem scale to show the impacts of fire on short-term (2-3 years) post-burn ecosystem ecohydrological function.

ID NITROGEN; GROWTH; FOREST; ABIES; PINE
AB The long-term effects of liming a peat soil on nitrogen availability to 3-year-old Picea sitchensis seedlings were assessed in greenhouse experiments. Seedlings were planted in pots containing either unlimed or limed peat soils that had been limed 28 years earlier. The plants were harvested in October 1993, April 1994 and July 1994 with these dates representing 100, 160 and 263 days after planting respectively. Concentration of extractable NO3- in the limed peat was higher than in the unlimed peat. Liming also resulted in increases in extractable organic N and total extractable N in the peat. On all harvesting occasions, percentage N-15 utilization and total N were reduced in plants grown on the limed peat. Decreased concentrations of N in the fine-root fractions were apparent for plants grown on the limed peat at the October and July harvests only. During the growing season, the above-ground parts of the plant were the dominant sinks for nitrogen. The needles and fine roots were the major fractions for the utilization of N-15 particularly in April and July The only effect of a limed peat on dry weight of plant fractions was a decrease in fine-root dry weight when plants were examined in October 1993. On all harvesting occasions, populations of mycorrhizae were decreased and roots were blackened for plants grown in the limed peat soil.

AB Biomass allocation and growth of Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris L., of various sizes (height 0.03-20 m) and ages (1-151 years) were investigated in two infertile sites (raised bog and sand dunes) to determine relative nitrogen and phosphorus limitations on productivity and their interactions and size-dependent controls. Dry mass weighted average nitrogen (N-W) and phosphorus (P-W) contents were higher in P. sylvestris in sand dunes than in those in the raised bog, but P-W/N-W ratios overlapped between the sites. Leaf dry mass ratio (F-L) and leaf-area ratio (LAR) increased with N-W, and F-L increased with P-W. The relative growth rate (R-G) was more strongly associated with P-W than with N-W. The net assimilation rate per leaf dry mass (NAR(M)) scaled positively with P-W but not with N-W, demonstrating that the stronger effect of P-W on growth was due to modified biomass allocation and physiology (R-G = NAR(M) x F-L), while N-W affected growth via biomass allocation. Partitioning and growth characteristics were poorly related to the P-W/N-W ratio. The overall decrease of growth in larger trees resulted from their lower LAR and F-L. Increases in size further led to a lower N-W but higher P-W. We conclude that optimum productivity at a given N-W requires a certain minimum P-W, not a specific "non-limiting" P-W/N-W ratio. While nutrients affect growth by changing biomass allocation and physiological activity, size primarily modifies biomass allocation.

AB In boreal peatlands, litter decomposition plays an important role inmodulating ecosystemcarbon (C) cycling and nutrient turnover. However, how climate warming and plant functional group interact to affect litter decomposition is still unclear in these ecosystems. Here, we collected fresh litters of six plant functional groups (nitrogen (N)-fixing species, deciduous tree, deciduous shrub, evergreen shrub, graminoid, and Sphagnum moss) from a boreal peatland located in northeast China. A laboratory incubation experimentwas used to determine the effect of temperature (10 degrees C vs. 20 degrees C) on microbial respiration and mass loss during decomposition. Among the six functional groups, the litters of N-fixing species and deciduous shrub, followed by deciduous tree, generally had the greatest mass losses and microbial respiration rates, whereas the Sphagnum moss decomposed with the slowest rate at both incubation temperatures. Increasing incubation temperature from 10 degrees C to 20 degrees C, microbial respiration rate and mass loss increased slightly for Sphagnum moss litters (25% and 19%, respectively), but increased dramatically for vascular plant litters (84-135% and 49-85%, respectively). For litters from vascular plants, both decomposition rate and temperature sensitivity showed a tight linear correlation with the initial C:N and C: phosphorus ratios. Considering that climate warming will cause increased dominance of woody plant species coupledwith decreased cover by Sphagnum mosses, this study provides clear evidence that climate warming and the associated changes to vegetation community composition can synergistically accelerate plant litter decomposition in boreal peatlands.

Short-term anoxic incubations with SO-35(4)2- as a tracer produced not only labeled reduced inorganic S (RIS) compounds (e.g. H2S, FeS, and FeS2), but also labeled reduced organic S, C-bonded sulfur (CBS), compounds.  The rate of production of CBS compounds averaged 59% of the production of RIS compounds.  Peat S pools for the top 10 cm were dominated by CBS (74% of total S), with RIS and ester sulfates each averaging only approximately 13% of the total S.  In the top 10 cm of peat, rates of reduced S production were very high relative to pool sizes, indicating that recycling of S in the peat is quite rapid.  The high degree of recycling made detection of reduced S accumulation in the peat impossible over the 9-month sampling period.  Our data support an important role for SO4(2-) reduction, however, in the retention of S in the cedar swamp of McDonalds Branch.

AB This field manipulation study tested the effect of weekly pulses of solutions of NH4NO3 and (NH4)(2)SO4 salts on the evolution of CH4 and N2O from peatland soils. Methane and nitrous oxide emission from a nutrient-poor fen in northern Minnesota USA was measured over a full growing season from plots receiving weekly additions of NH4NO3 or (NH4)(2)SO4. At this relatively pristine site, natural additions of N and S in precipitation occur at 8 and 5 kg ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Nine weekly additions of the dissolved salts were made to increase this to a total deposition of 31 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) on the NH4NO3-amended plots and 30 and 29 kg ha(-1) y(-1) of N and S, respectively, in the (NH4)(2)SO4-amended plots. Methane flux was measured weekly from treatment and control plots and all data comparisons are made on plots measured on the same day.
   After the onset of the treatments, and over the course of the growing season, CH4 emission from the (NH4)(2)SO4-amended plots averaged 163 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), significantly lower than the same-day control plot mean of 259 mg CH4 m(-)2 d(-)1 (repeated measures ANOVA). Total CH4 flux from (NH4)(2)SO4 treatment plots was one third lower than from control plots, at 11.7 and 17.1 g CH4 m(-2), respectively. Methane emission from the NH4NO3-amended plots (mean of 256 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) was not significantly different from that of controls measured on the same day (mean of 225 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Total CH4 flux from NH4NO3 treatment plots and same-day controls was 16.9 and 15.1 g CH4 m(-)2, respectively. In general, stable, relatively warm and wet periods followed by environmental 'triggers' such as rainfall or changes in water table or atmospheric pressure, which produced a CH4 'pulse' in the other plots, produced no observable peak in CH4 emission from the (NH4)(2)SO4-amended plots. Nitrous oxide emission from all of the plots was below the detection limit over the course of the experiment.

AB The improvement of soil conditions by water table lowering through drainage is indicative of the potential for tree growth response to this treatment. We measured water table level, peat water content and temperature, and rates of decomposition of Sphagnum peat, cellulose and wood sticks in a black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP.) peatland of eastern Quebec, on a control site and a drained site. In general, the water table was lowered within 15 m of the ditches, resulting in a marked difference between spacings of 20-30 m and 40-50-60 m. In the middle of the 40-m spacing, the frequencies of lowering below the root zone (20 cm) and the 30-cm depth were respectively increased by 33% and 40%. Feat water content at 10-cm depth decreased by 20% to 29% following drainage and the effect appeared related to ditch closeness. At 20- and 30-cm depths, decreases of the same order were observed only at 5 m from the ditch. At distances of 10 m and more, the average water content remained within 10% of saturation at 20 cm and within 5% at 30 cm. After drainage, the seasonal maximum temperature at the 10-cm depth increased by 3.5 degrees C at 5 m from the ditch and by 1.5 degrees C al greater distances, compared to the control where the mean seasonal maximum was 13.5 degrees C. At ail distances, the autumnal cooling of the substrate was accelerated and winter temperature was 1 to 2 degrees C less than the control site. Temperature at 30-cm depth was not modified by drainage. Rates of decomposition were accelerated, mainly at the 30-cm depth and within the first 10 m from the ditch. At 10-cm depth, decomposition was weakly related to drainage and it is possible that relatively low water contents countered the effect of temperature increase.

AB The molecular structure of humus substances from permafrost-affected peat mounds of the East European forest-tundra has been studied with the use of up to date physicochemical methods (C-13 NMR, EPR spectroscopy). The structural-functional parameters of humus substances from these soils are specified by the integral action of cryogenic processes in the active layer, natural selection of aromatic structures in the course of humification, and by the species composition and degree of peat decomposition; they reflect the climatic conditions of peat formation in the Holocene. Humic acids of peat bogs are represented by low-condensed molecular structures with the low portion of carbon atoms of aromatic components, which increases down the soil profile, and by with the high content of non-oxidized aliphatic fragments. Active changes in the portions of aromatic and non-oxidized aliphatic fragments take place at the lower boundary of the active layer in the soils of bare peat spots. Such changes may serve as the basis for further search of the bioindicators of recent climate changes.

AB The boreal landscape is a complex, spatio-temporally varying mosaic of forest and mire landscape elements that control surface water hydrology and chemistry. Here, we assess long-term water quality time series from three nested headwater streams draining upland forest (C2), peat/mire (C4) and mixed (C7) (forest and mire) catchments. Acid deposition in this region is low and is further declining. Temporal trends in weather and runoff (1981-2008), dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] (1993-2010) and other water quality parameters (1987-2011) were assessed. There was no significant annual trend in precipitation or runoff. However, runoff increased in March and declined in May. This suggested an earlier snowmelt regime in recent years. Significant monotonic increasing trends in air temperature and length of growing season suggested a decrease in snowfall and less spring runoff. Stream [DOC] was positively correlated with some trace metals (copper, iron and zinc) and negatively with several other chemical parameters (e. g. sulfate, conductivity, calcium). Both sulfate and conductivity showed declining trends, while a significant increase was observed in pH during winter and spring. Calcium and magnesium showed monotonic decreasing trends. The declining trajectories of stream base cation and sulfate concentrations during other times of the year were not accompanied by changes in pH and alkalinity. These results indicate subtle effects of recovery from acidification. Water temperature increased significantly both annually and in most months. A simultaneous monotonic increase in iron (Fe) and [DOC] in autumn suggests co-transport of Fe-DOC in the form of organometallic complexes. monotonic increase in UV absorbance in most months without co-occurring changes in DOC trend suggests a shift in DOC quality to a more humic-rich type. The observed increase in soil solution [DOC] and subtle trends in stream [DOC] suggest that climate rather than recovery from acidification is the dominant driver of DOC trends in the Svartberget catchment.

AB Paludiculture, the cultivation of crops on wet or rewetted agricultural peatlands, sustainably integrates productive land use with the provision of multiple ecosystem services. Paludiculture crops thrive under waterlogged conditions that stimulate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal from soil and water and convert serious drainage-induced carbon (C) losses to C sequestration. Nutrient uptake by paludicrops can prevent mobilisation after rewetting and provide opportunities for purification of nutrient-rich water. Uncertainty remains, however, if and to what extent N loading and a subsequent increase in biomass productivity affect nutrient cycling as well as emissions of the potent greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In this study, we use mesocosms with rewetted peat to investigate the effect of different N sources in surface water on biomass production of Typha latifolia, a typical paludiculture crop, and the emissions of CH4 and N2O. Organic (Azolla filiculoides; urea) or mineral (KNO3 ; NH4NO) N was supplied either a single time (steady state) or repeatedly (pulse) to simulate a total surface water load of 150 kg N ha(-1) . We found that N stimulated aboveground and belowground biomass production and nutrient uptake by T. latifolia. These effects were absent in Azolla treatments. Whereas after two months CH4 emissions arose to substantial amounts (> 10 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) in unvegetated mesocosms loaded with organic N, they remained very low (< 1 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) in vegetated mesocosms, despite the labile C pool in the extensive belowground biomass and organic N loading. Overall, N2O emissions were close to zero and were only detected episodically after NO(3)(- )loading, irrespective of plant presence. Our findings support that T. latifolia as a paludicrop effectively removes various forms of N and P when harvested, and strongly mitigates CH4 emission after the rewetting of agricultural peat soils compared to unvegetated conditions.

AB Question: Dwarf shrub moorland dominated by ericaceous plants is a distinctive, internationally important feature of northwest Europe, with its stronghold in Scotland. There have been major declines in its condition and extent. How has moorland composition changed within Scotland over the past ca. 35 yr and what is the role of climate change, pollution and grazing in driving these changes? Location: Five hundred and forty locations across Scotland, UK. Methods: We used a long-term resurvey approach to assess change across Scottishmoorlands. We relocated plots sampled ca. 35 yr previously in alpine heath, dry heath, wet heath and bog, and recorded vegetation species composition. We assessed change in species group richness and cover and mean Ellenberg values between surveys, using paired t-tests. We used CCA with variation partitioning and regression analysis to analyse the vegetation data with spatial data sets on climate, pollution and grazing, to assess the role of each driver in driving vegetation changes. Results: Significant diversity and compositional changes between surveys were found for all habitat types, particularly alpine heath. Significant associations were found with climate (many variables), pollution (N and S) and herbivore number (primarily deer). Species richness generally increased, but several specialist species declined in cover, especially those associated with higher altitude habitats (e. g. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Salix herbacea and alpine lichens). Many of the most successful species are ubiquitous, e. g. the widespread grazing-and pollution-tolerant graminoids Anthoxanthum odoratum, Juncus squarrosus, Festuca rubra and Nardus stricta and the generalist mosses Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and Hylocomium splendens. Conclusions: Diversity and composition of moorlands in Scotland have changed significantly over the ca. 35-yr period studied; the drivers of these changes are complex, with climate, pollution and grazing playing variable roles across habitats. The reduction in specialist species, homogenization of alpine heaths and declines in forb and lichen cover all represent negative changes in the biodiversity value of Scottishmoorlands.

AB The present study elucidates the role of natural iron fertilization of the coastal ocean by so-called "blackwater rivers". Areas of marsh, fen, peatland, boreal forest etc. are characterized by organic-rich soils. From those soils, humic substances (humic and fulvic acids) are leached to the aquatic system resulting in river water that is low in pH and dark-brown in color. The point is that "blackwater rivers" tend to be rich in dissolved iron due to the unique chelating properties of humic and fulvic acids which bind Fe(III) and keep it in solution. We performed algal physiological (growth rate) experiments under conditions of iron deficiency with the marine unicellular phytoplankton algae Chlorella salina and Diacronema lutheri in 0.2 mu m cut-off filtered mixtures of natural "blackwater river" water and synthetic seawater. Our results demonstrate that the iron naturally present in "blackwater rivers" is readily bioavailable to bothmarine algal species. Further more, the humic and fulvic acids exert an additional stimulatory effect on the marine algae. Both algae thrive much better in the presence of natural humic and fulvic acids as compared to a mediumwhere EDTA is used as an iron-chelating agent. Our results indicate that "blackwater rivers", in sharp contrast to other types of rivers, are excellent sources of bioavailable iron to marine phytoplankton. This natural iron fertilization may give rise to photosynthesis-driven sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere to the sea, as can be seen from the visualization of CO2 surface concentrations by NASA (NASA GEOS-5 model) which shows the global sources and sinks of CO2 localized in time and space. The results by NASA suggest that strong marine CO2 sinks in coastal waters tend to occur close to "blackwater river" estuaries. It is thus evident that "blackwater rivers" act as important sources of a limiting nutrient (iron) to the ocean. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Airborne laser scanning systems (Light Detection And Ranging, LiDAR) are very well suited to the study of landscape and vegetation structure over large extents. Spatially distributed measurements describing the three-dimensional character of landscape surfaces and vegetation architecture can be used to understand eco-geomorphic and ecohydrological processes, and this is particularly pertinent in peatlands given the increasing recognition that these landscapes provide a variety of ecosystem services (water provision, flood mitigation and carbon sequestration). In using LiDAR data for monitoring peatlands, it is important to understand how well peatland surface structures (with fine length scales) can be described. Our approach integrates two laser scanning technologies, namely terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne LiDAR surveys, to assess how effective airborne LiDAR is at measuring these fine-scale microtopographic ecohydrological structures. By combining airborne and TLS, we demonstrate an improved spatial understanding of the signal measured by the airborne LiDAR. Critically, results demonstrate that LiDAR digital surface models are subject to specific errors related to short-sward ecosystem structure, causing the vegetation canopy height and surface-drainage network depth to be underestimated. TLS is shown to be effective at describing these structures over small extents, allowing the information content and accuracy of airborne LiDAR to be understood and quantified more appropriately. These findings have important implications for the appropriate degree of confidence ecohydrologists can apply to such data when using them as a surrogate for field measurements. They also illustrate the need to couple LiDAR data with ground validation data in order to improve assessment of ecohydrological function in such landscapes.

AB In this paper, we present the first comprehensive long-term record of preanthropogenic rates of atmospheric mercury accumulation in dated peat deposits for the High Arctic of Canada. Geochemical studies of two peat hummocks from Bathurst Island, Nunavut reveal substantial inputs from soil dust (titanium), marine aerosols (bromine), and mineral-water interactions (uranium). Mercury, however, was supplied to these peat mounds exclusively by atmospheric deposition. Mercury concentration measurements and age dating of the peat profiles indicate rather constant natural "background" mercury flux of ca. 1 microgram per square meter per year from 5900 to 800 calibrated years BP. These values are well within the range of the mercury fluxes reported from other Arctic locations, but also by peat cores from southern Canada that provide a record of atmospheric Hg accumulation extending back 8000 years. Thus, preanthropogenic Hg fluxes in the Arctic were not significantly different from atmospheric Hg fluxes in the temperate zone. In preindustrial times, therefore, the High Arctic was no more important as a sink for global atmospheric mercury than was the temperate zone.

AB The soil atmosphere in forested peat soils with depths of 0.8-1.2 m was monitored regularly for 3 years. Samples from gas equilibration chambers were analysed for N2, O2, CO2, CH4, N2O and Ne by gas chromatography.
   Short spring periods with simultaneous and rapid O2 decrease/CO2 increase were the characteristics features at a soil depth of 5 cm. They were the effects of perched water tables on frozen soil layers. The soil atmosphere composition at a depth of 20 cm was particularly variable in the poorly drained sites, where this soil depth was close to the alternating level of the groundwater. At a depth of 50 cm, CO2 and CH4 had minimum concentrations in early or mid-summer and maximum concentrations in the late autumn or early winter. The reverse pattern for O2 was indicated, but was less clear.
   In individual profiles and on average, O2 decreased and CO2 increased with increasing depth, except during some transient periods in the spring.
   Medium (H6) humified, inadequately drained Sphagnum peat differed from well humified (H8), well-drained wood peat, in that it contained considerable concentrations of CH4. Only very small concentrations were occasionally found in the humified wood peat and they did not increase when the groundwater level rose after clearfelling.
   The groundwater level rose after clearfelling on both types of peat. Concentrations of O2 decreased and CO2 increased in the topsoil, particularly in the medium humified and insufficiently drained Sphagnum peat.
   The soil atmospheres, as represented by mean concentrations and extreme concentrations at three depths during the growing season, were significantly different on all plots, including the parallel clearfelled and forested plots.

AB To test the potential for developing sub-decadal resolution records of ombrotrophic bog surface wetness (BSW), selected abrupt climate events were identified in cores from four sites in north-west Europe and time-slices over each event were investigated at 25-mm resolution using peat humification, testate amoeba and plant macrofossil analyses. Agedepth models based on radiocarbon, spheroidal carbonaceous particle and tephra dates were applied and the error in these models was used to determine the effective temporal sampling resolution, which in most cases was sub-decadal. Fine-resolution results revealed some inconsistencies in the co-variability of individual proxies and there was a lack of correspondence between some results from adjacent cores. However, we found evidence of abrupt shifts in BSW occurring over ca. 520 years, indicating a more rapid proxy response than identified in previous research. To maximize potential temporal resolution and produce reliable sub-decadal BSW data in future research, we recommended that peat-based studies should obtain the best possible chronological control, focus on sites with high species diversity and rapid accumulation rates and perform replicate coring, or use open peat sections where the stratigraphy can be clearly seen, to assess intra-site differences in microtopography. Site-specific factors should be a primary consideration in the selection of sites for future fine-resolution research. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The migration of Cs-137 into deep peat layers is mainly determined by long-term annual fluctuations in the ground-water level and depends considerably on the microrelief of the bog surface. Radiocesium was found to be retained selectively by humic and fulvic acids of the first (0.1 N NaOH-extractable) fraction. A close correlation of cesium retention with the ash content in peat was observed. The accumulation of Cs-137 in root-inhabited horizons is enhanced by soil biota. The level of contamination of oligotrophic peatbogs corresponds to the background cesium concentrations in mineral soils of Western Siberia.

AB The value of both high-precision (HP) and AMS C-14 determinations in the fine-resolution dating of recent peat at Stor Amyran, near Umea, northern Sweden has been explored. A detailed chronology of accumulation, based an C-14, an occurrence of the Askja AD 1875 tephra and Am-241 measurements has been derived for the last 700 years. This shows significant changes in the mass balance of the peat profile, with minimum rates of net carbon sequestration overlapping with the period of minimum spring and summer temperature documented by published tree-ring evidence. The paper presents a methodology for calculating empirically past changes in the rate of net carbon sequestration in boreal peatlands and for exploring the effects of climatic variations (and possible future global warming) on these rates.

AB Northern boreal forests are characterized by accumulation of accumulation of peat (e.g., known as paludification). The functioning of northern boreal forest species and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes appear to depend on soil conditions. Climate warming is expected to have particularly pronounced effects on paludified boreal ecosystems and can alter current forest species composition and adaptation by changing soil conditions such as moisture, temperature regimes, and soil respiration. In this paper, we review and synthesize results from various reported studies (i.e., 88 research articles cited hereafter) to assess the effects of climatic warming on soil conditions of paludified forests in North America. Predictions that global warming may increase the decomposition rate must be considered in combination with its impact on soil moisture, which appears to be a limiting factor. Local adaptation or acclimation to current climatic conditions is occurring in boreal forests, which is likely to be important for continued ecosystem stability in the context of climate change. The most commonly cited response of boreal forest species to global warming is a northward migration that tracks the climate and soil conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) to which they are adapted. Yet, some constraints may influence this kind of adaptation, such as water availability, changes in fire regimes, decomposer adaptations, and the dynamic of peat accumulation. In this paper, as a study case, we examined an example of potential effects of climatic warming on future paludification changes in the eastern lowland region of Canada through three different combined hypothetical scenarios based on temperature and precipitation (e.g., unchanged, increase, or decrease). An increase scenario in precipitation will likely favor peat accumulation in boreal forest stands prone to paludification and facilitate forested peatland expansion into upland forest, while decreased or unchanged precipitation combined with an increase in temperature will probably favor succession of forested peatlands to upland boreal forests. Each of the three scenarios were discussed in this study, and consequent silvicultural treatment options were suggested for each scenario to cope with anticipated soil and species changes in the boreal forests. We concluded that, despite the fact boreal soils will not constrain adaptation of boreal forests, some consequences of climatic warming may reduce the ability of certain species to respond to natural disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks, and extreme weather events.

AB The boreal landscape is a mosaic of wetlands with distinct ecosystem properties. Algae are important for wetland functioning, but relatively little is known about the structure of algal communities among boreal wetlands. We documented spatial and temporal variability of algal community dynamics and productivity during a growing season in 6 wetlands (1 rich and 1 poor fen, 1 tussock, and 3 riverine marshes) in interior Alaska. Algal biomass and productivity were greater in the poor fen and a riverine marsh than in all other wetlands. Water depth and nutrients were significant predictors of benthic algal biomass and productivity among wetlands and were greatest immediately after the spring thaw and decreased during the growing season. Water depth and nutrients (N and P) explained the most variability in algal community structure. Algal community structure differed among wetlands, and temporal variation in environmental conditions was a significant predictor of the relative abundance of algal genera in individual wetlands. N-2-fixing cyanobacteria increased in abundance with a seasonal decline in water depth and nutrient concentrations. Our characterization of algal community dynamics and productivity in relation to environmental characteristics will help to forecast future wetland function in a changing boreal landscape.

AB Harvest residue decomposition can significantly contribute to nutrient and heavy metal exports to receiving water courses. This study monitors the nutrient and heavy metal dynamics in decaying Sitka spruce and lodgepole pine harvest residue needles on Atlantic blanket peat forests in the west of Ireland. Using the litterbag method, harvest residue was placed both within and between furrows in two uncut forest and two clear-cut sites. On the clear-cut sites, the litterbags were positioned outside the harvest residue piles (i.e. brash windrows). Over the 2-year monitoring period, the needles decomposed slower at the clear-cut sites than the uncut forest sites, with mass losses of 46-55 and 58-77 %, respectively. Approximately 20 % less phosphorous (P) was released from the decaying needles at the clear-cut sites, while nitrogen (N) was released only at the uncut sites. Tree species was a significant factor contributing to nutrient and heavy metal release and accumulation patterns, with higher concentrations of aluminium (Al), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in the decaying spruce needles than in pine. Conversely, the spruce needles showed accelerated depletion of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) relative to the pine. The harvest residue needle positioning (inside furrow/between furrows) and the site soil characteristics contributed significantly to Al transformations in spruce needles and iron (Fe) in both spruce and pine needles, with more accumulation occurring inside the furrows where Al and Fe contents of the peat were high. Manganese (Mn) was released from the needles in three of the four sites with a total release of over 90 % within 2 years. In the remaining site, where the Mn content of the peat was high, an accumulation of Mn in the needles was observed. The decomposition of needles on blanket peat catchments may be a significant source of P to receiving water courses, owing to their fast release of P, but not a likely source for N export.

AB Organic fades analyses quantify the coal constituents and plot various associations to discriminate the paleoenvironment for coal bearing successions. This allows the relation of coal composition to mire ecosystems or environments. Coal petrographic models are used extensively to reconstruct the nature of ancient peat forming environments. Many authors proposed relations between specific maceral assemblages and/or micro-lithotypes and peat forming environments. The key controlling factors which affect peat environment include hydrogeology, redox, pH, vegetation type, clastic influx, sedimentation and peat accumulation rate etc. Recent advancements in coal maceral study and organic petrology reveal the pros and cons of the available indices and models. The main reasons for the failure of the petrographic models are oversimplification of the effects of humification on tissue preservation vs. destruction, the use of post-diagenetic processes (e.g. geochemical gelification) in determining depositional environments, changes in petrographic composition related to floral evolution, geological age, rank increase and compaction, lack of distinction between different inertinite maceral in some models. Here the widely used petrographic indices and models are reviewed based on the observations of several workers and the applicability and concepts of paleo-environmental reconstruction are discussed. A multi-disciplinary approach including petrography, palynology, chemistry etc. has been recommended, which is more logical and scientific than the exclusive use of petrographic composition for paleoenvironmental interpretation.

AB The bio-diversity (vegetation and fauna) of peatlands, like all wetland ecosystems, is very fragile as it requires specific wet conditions. Over the past 20 years, increasing efforts have been made to restore degraded wetlands, to re-create new wetlands where they were lost, and to sustainably manage for multiple benefits. However, actions to restore and preserve wetlands require an in-depth knowledge of the water cycle in the system. We used chemical and multi-isotopic approaches, combined with hydrological tools (measuring potentiometric levels and spring discharge), for tracing the water and dissolved-element fluxes in the Narces de la Sauvetat peatland (Central France) and for better understanding of water budget components involved in this ecosystem. This multi-pronged approach clearly demonstrated its effectiveness for improving our understanding of the hydrological functioning of this wetland ecosystem. The two main results are that: (1) The water volume flowing out of the peatland through the Fouragettes stream is often negligible; and (2) At least three strong groundwater fluxes with distinct chemical and isotopic signatures supply water to the peatland. This new understanding will help decision makers maintain the water balance of the peatland, which is essential for the preservation of this fragile ecosystem. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

DE peatlands soils; secondary transformation process; phosphorus forms;

AB The aim of the research was to complement the knowledge on profile distribution and accumulation of phosphorus forms in the soils changed under the influence of secondary organic matter transformation process in dehydrated peatlands. The soil research was carried out in the upper Liwiec river valley in the middle-east of Poland. In the soil material taken from the moorsh (M1, M2, M3) and peat (O) horizons of the Murshic Histosols, the physical and chemical properties were determined and the soil phosphorus fractions with different activity in the environment by sequential extraction method were separated. The profile distribution of the total phosphorus content (TP) and values of carbon/phosphorus (TC/TP) ratio were characteristic for dehydrated peat soils included in the secondary transformation process (M1>M2>M3>O). This process also increased the contribution of the available phosphorus forms (NH4Cl-P), forms bound on the surface of iron (III) and manganese (IV) oxides and hydroxides (redox-P), as well as mineral (mHCl-P) and organic (oHCl-P) forms separated by 0.5 M HCl. Significant accumulation of the phosphorus compounds in the moorsh horizons of the investigated soils can be considered as a potential threat to the natural environment of the studied area due to the risk of decomposition of the phosphorus compounds when the area will be rehydrated.

AB This paper presents a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the Wilczkow fen (central Poland). The fen developed in an inactive valley at the onset of the Holocene (similar to 11 ka BP) and peat accumulation lasted until 5.7 ka BP. Multi-proxy reconstructions were made on the basis of palaeobotanical, cladoceran, chironomid, beetle and geochemical analyses. A Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM, unsupervised artificial neural network) of the biotic sequence distinguished four stages of fen history. Stage X-1 (11.0-10.7 ka BP) was relatively wet and cool. Organic matter started to accumulate but the habitat conditions remained unstable. Moss, sedge and fern communities then developed. Sedimentary changes reveal an intensive groundwater supply at that time. Numerous and diverse chironomid and cladoceran subfossils indicate nearly permanent aquatic conditions. During stage Y-1 (10.6-9.2 ka BP) conditions were dry and the upper peat layer desiccated. Cladocera nearly disappeared whereas chironomids were represented by semi-terrestrial and predatory (Tanypodinae) species. Conditions started to be more reducing. All the remaining samples belonged to the interweaving stages X-2 and Y-2. Stage Y-2 (mostly 9.1-7.3 and 6.0-5.7 ka BP) was also dry but humidity increased towards the top. Oxidizing conditions occurred and the pH became more alkaline, favouring Cladium mariscus. The basin received mostly allochthonous matter input at that time. Stage X-2 (mostly 6.8-6.1 ka BP) was humid and warm. The groundwater supply remained low but there was an increase in precipitation, changing local conditions to ombrotrophic. Species-rich chironomid and cladoceran communities were associated with temporary pools. Finally, conditions returned to those characteristic of stage Y-2. The presented reconstruction documents long-term abiotic and biotic changes determined by water supply, including groundwater outflow, which have rarely been detected at a multi-proxy scale. We show that inactivated valley fens are sensitive to climate-driven hydrological fluctuations. Kohonen neural networks appear to be a promising method for analysing variability in multi-proxy data.

AB This study applied the static chamber method to evaluate the CO2 fluxes from December 2013 to October 2014 in the coastal wetland of Jiaozhou Bay, China. The study area was divided into Spartina alterniflora flat, Phragmites australis flat, Suaeda salsa flat and mud flat. Results showed that net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) presented obviously temporal and spatial variations during growing season, and slight fluctuation in non-growing season. Vegetated flats (S. alterniflora flat, P. australis flat and S. salsa flat) acted as CO2 sinks during growing season and CO2 sources during non-growing season; while mud flat acted as a CO2 sink through the entire period. Over the growing season, the estimated total NEE were -1202.83 g CO2 m(-2) in S. alterniflora flat, - 1129.16 g CO2 m(-2) in P. australis flat and -237.43 g CO2 m(-2) in S. salsa flat, respectively. Daytime NEE were significantly exponential related to light intensity in S. alterniflora flat and P. australis flat; whereas no overt exponential relationship was found between these two factors in S. salsa flat. In P. australis flat, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production (GPP) in growing season were estimated to be 2874.05 and 1744.89 g CO2 m(-2), respectively; R-eco was significantly exponential related to air temperature and soil temperature at different depths, among which soil temperature at the depth of 5 cm was the most remarkable; temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of R-eco ranged from 2.72 to 3.67. Above ground biomass of P. australis over the entire growing season showed nonlinear relationships with NEE, GPP, and R-eco; while it showed significant linear relationships with these three factors during early and peak growing season. As for the mud flat acing as a CO2 sink, it is supposed to be caused by inorganic process, however the mechanism is not definite. Further research on the long-term and complete observations of CO2 exchange at the mud flat-atmosphere interface is necessary.

AB Northern temperate zone (30 degrees to 50 degrees latitude) peatlands store a large proportion of the world's terrestrial carbon (C) and are subject to high- intensity, stand-replacing wildfires characterized by flaming stage combustion of aboveground vegetation and long- duration smoldering stage combustion of organic soils. Coastal peatlands are a unique region in which long- duration wildfire soil combustion is responsible for the majority of total annual emissions from all wildfires in the North American coastal plain. We developed a new method and approach to estimate aboveground and belowground C emissions from a 2008 peatland wildfire by analyzing vegetation C losses from field surveys of biomass consumption from the fire and soil C losses derived from the Soil Survey Geographic Database, a digital elevation model derived from airborne optical remote- sensing technology and Las turberas ubicadas en la zona templada (30 degrees a 50 degrees de latitud norte) almacenan una gran proporcion del carbono (C) total del mundo, y esta sujetas a incendios de gran intensidad que producen el reemplazo de rodales y que se caracterizan por un estado de combustion por llamas en la vegetacion aerea y de combustion incandescente y de larga duracion en suelos organicos. Las turberas costeras representan la unica region en la cual la combustion incandescente de larga duracion es la responsable de la mayoria de las emisiones totales anuales de todos los incendios en las planicies costeras de Norte America. Nosotros desarrollamos un nuevo metodo y enfoque para estimar emisiones de C, tanto aereas como subterraneas, de un incendio de turberas de 2008 a traves del analisis de las perdidas de C mediante relevamientos a campo de combustion de biomasa por el fuego, perdidas de C derivados de la base de datos del Relevamiento Geografico de Suelos, un modelo de elevacion digital derivado de tec-ground elevation surveys using a Global Navigation Satellite System receiver. The approach to estimate belowground C emissions employed pre-fire LIDAR-derived elevation from ground return points coupled with post-fire survey-grade GPS elevation measurements from co-located ground return points. Aboveground C emission calculations were characterized for litter, shrub foliage and woody biomass, and tree foliage fractions in different vegetation classes, thereby providing detailed emissions sources. The estimate of wildland fire C emissions considered the contribution of hydrologic regime and land management to fire severity and peat burn depth. The peatland wildfire had a mean peat burn depth of 0.42 m and resulted in estimated belowground fire emissions of 9.16 Tg C and aboveground fire emissions of 0.31 Tg C, for total fire emissions of 9.47 Tg C (1 Tg = 10(12) grams). The mean belowground C emissions were estimated at 544.43 t C ha(-1), and the mean aboveground C emissions were 18.33 t C ha(-1) (1 t = 10(6) grams). nologias opticas de sensores remotos para evaluar particulas areas, y relevamientos de elevacion del terreno usando un receptor del Sistema Global de Navegacion. El enfoque para estimar emisiones de C subterraneo empleo puntos pre-fuego (derivados de LIDAR) acoplados con relevamientos de estos puntos post-fuego, y a los cuales se retornaba y re-media con GPS. Los calculos de las emisiones se caracterizaron para mantillo, follaje de arbustos y biomasa lenosa, y fracciones de follaje de arboles en diferentes clases, los cuales proveian detalles de las fuentes de emision.
   La estimacion de las emisiones de C del incendio considero la contribucion del regimen hidrologico y el manejo de la tierra en la severidad y la profundidad de la quema de las turberas. El incendio de la turbera tuvo una profundidad media de 0,42 m y resulto en una estimacion de la emision subterranea de 9,16 Tg de C y una emision de la biomasa aerea de 0,31 Tg C, dando un total de 9,47 Tg de C (1 Tg = 1012 gramos). Las emisiones medias de C subterraneo fueron estimadas en 544,43 t C ha(-1), y las emisiones medias de C de la biomasa aerea fueron de 18,33 t C ha(-1) (1 t = 10(6) gramos).

AB High-resolution studies of peat profiles are frequently undertaken to investigate natural and anthropogenic disturbances over time. However, overlapping profiles of the most commonly applied age-dating techniques, including C-14 and Pb-210, often show significant offsets (> decadal) and biases that can be difficult to resolve. Here we investigate variations in the chronometers and individual site histories from six ombrotrophic peat bogs in central and northern Alberta. Dates produced using pre- and post-bomb C-14, Pb-210 (corroborated with Cs-137 and Am-241), and cryptotephra peaks, are compared and then integrated using OxCal's P_Sequence function to produce a single Bayesian age model. Environmental histories for each site obtained using physical and chemical characteristics of the peat cores, e.g. macrofossils, humification, ash content, and dry density, provide important constraints for the models by highlighting periods with significant changes in accumulation rate, e.g. fire events, permafrost development, and prolonged surficial drying. Despite variable environmental histories, it is possible to produce high-resolution age-depth models for each core sequence. Consistent offsets between C-14 and Pb-210 dates pre-1960s are seen at five of the six sites, but tephra-corrected Pb-210 data can be used to produce more coherent models at three of these sites. Processes such as permafrost development and thaw, surficial drying and local fires can disrupt the normal processes by which chronological markers and environmental records are incorporated in the peat record. In consequence, applying standard dating methodologies to these records will result in even greater uncertainties and discrepancies between the different dating tools. These results show that using any single method to accurately date peat profiles where accumulation has not been uniform over time may be unreliable, but a comprehensive multi-method investigation paired with the application of Bayesian statistics can produce more robust chronologies. New cryptotephra data for the Alberta region are also reported here, including the historical Novarupta-Katmai 1912 eruption, White River Ash (East), and glass from Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Churchill, and probable Aleutian sources.

AB Palaeoecological methods can provide an environmental context for archaeological sites, enabling the nature of past human activity to be explored from an indirect but alternative perspective. Through a palynological study of a small fen peatland located within the catchment of a multi-period prehistoric complex at Ballynahatty, Co. Down, Northern Ireland, we reconstruct the vegetation history of the area during the early prehistoric period. The pollen record reveals tentative evidence for Mesolithic activity in the area at 6410-6220 cal BC, with woodland disturbance identified during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transitional period ca. 4430-3890 cal BC. A more significant impact on the landscape is observed in the Early Neolithic from 3950 to 3700 cal BC, with an opening up of the forest and the establishment of a mixed agricultural economy. This activity precedes and continues to be evident through the Mid-Neolithic during which megalithic tombs and related burial sites were constructed at Ballynahatty. Due to chronological uncertainties and a possible hiatus in peat accumulation in the fen, the contemporary environment of the Ballynahatty timber circle complex (constructed and used ca. 3080-2490 cal BC) and henge (dating to the third millennium cal BC) cannot certainly be established. Nevertheless, the pollen record suggests that the landscape remained open through to the Bronze Age, implying a long continuity of human activity in the area. These findings support the idea that the Ballynahatty prehistoric complex was the product of a gradual and repeated restructuring of the ritual and ceremonial landscape whose significance continued to be recognised throughout the early prehistoric period.

ID SOIL; FIELD; BOG
AB Long-term changes in the physical and hydraulic properties of peat result from the decomposition and consolidation processes. The saturated hydraulic conductivity (K (s)) of peat is depth-dependent and could increase or decrease with depth; therefore, K (s) determination on a large number of samples is required to more accurately assess field variability. The cube method is a popular laboratory procedure to determine K (s) because it allows use of smaller sample dimensions, while minimizing edge effects. This article describes the design and use of an alternate split container to enclose undisturbed peat cubes during measurement of K (s) and the application of this method to a field site in Northwest Territories, Canada. The method allows for simpler and more controlled K (s) measurements while also permitting anisotropy measurements. Matched tests on identical samples (K (s) range 21-314 m/d), using the split-container and wax methods, showed a good agreement for intermediate K (s) values; however, significant deviations occurred for low and high K (s) values. Hydraulic-conductivity measurements taken on field samples showed a decrease with depth and exhibited anisotropic hydraulic conductivity as expected based on previous studies.

AB Aim: Plant phylogeographic data from the Patagonian Channels are scant and it is largely unknown how the extensive Quaternary glaciations affected the population dynamics of the region's major vegetation component, that is cushion peat bogs (Magellanic moorland). Whether ice-age glaciers wiped out all terrestrial plant life or whether some populations persisted in situ remains unclear. We reconstructed the phylogeography of two dominant Patagonian cushion peat bog species, Astelia pumila (G. Forst.) Gaudich. (Asteliaceae) and Donatia fascicularis J. R. Forst. & G. Forst. (Stylidiaceae), to test (a) the hypothesis of a glacial refugium for moorland plants in south-central Chile and (b) the tabula rasa scenario for the Patagonian Channels. The retrieved phylogeographic patterns were compared with those reported previously for a further cushion peat bog species (Pfanzelt et al., Molecular Ecology 26, 4027-4044), with the objective to provide a broader picture of how West Patagonian moorland plants responded to the Quaternary ice-ages.
   Location: West and Fuegian Patagonia, and the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), southern South America.
   Methods: DNA sequence data from seven and fourteen, respectively, nuclear loci containing Simple Sequence Repeats of 371 and 328 individuals of the two study species were analysed using population genetic summary statistics, phylogenetic networks and Bayesian and multivariate methods to determine genetic structure. Ecological niche modelling was used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of suitable habitat at the Last Glacial Maximum.
   Results: All A. pumila populations belong to a single population genetic cluster. In the case of D. fascicularis, only the northernmost sampled population from Nahuelbuta (Chile) is genetically distinct, whereas the remainder forms a cluster without much further substructure. According to palaeodistribution models, south-central Chile offered suitable habitat during the last glacial.
   Main conclusion: Both ecological niche modelling and the very low genetic subdifferentiation are congruent with a tabula rasa scenario for the Patagonian Channels. Populations survived the last glacial in south-central Chile, in an area to the northwest of the ice sheet. From there, southern regions were recolonized through highly bottlenecked source populations. Other, non-mutually exclusive factors may have further shaped the population genetic patterns, among them high gene flow mediated by the strong westerly winds.

AB Data on radiocarbon (C-14), Cs-137, Pb-210, and Am-241 levels in an ombrotrophic peat sequence from a montane site on the east coast of Ireland are compared with data from a similar sequence at an Atlantic peatland site on the west coast. The C-14 profiles from the west and east coasts show a broadly similar pattern. Levels increase from 100 pMC or less in the deepest horizons examined, to peak values at the west and east coast sites of 117 +/- 0.6 pMC and 132 +/- 0.7 pMC, respectively (corresponding to maximal fallout from nuclear weapons testing around 1964), thereafter diminishing to levels of 110-113 pMC near the surface. Significantly, peak levels at the east coast site are considerably higher than corresponding levels at the west coast site, though both are lower than reported peak values for continental regions. The possibility of significant C-14 enrichment at the east coast site due to past discharges from nuclear installations in the UK seems unlikely. The Pb-210(ex) inventory at the east coast site (6500 Bq m(-2)) is Significantly higher than at the west coast (5300 Bq m(-2)) and is consistent with the difference in rainfall at the two sites. Finally, Cs-137 and Am-241 inventories at the east coast site also exceed those at the west coast site by similar proportions (east:west ratio of approximately 1:1.2).

AB In the article thermal researches results for the humic acids (HA) in sphagnous peat which is the most suitable objects for hymification process study characterized by simple botanical composition with high sphagnous mosses residuals content are provided. The impact assessment of the initial peat botanical composition on thermodynamic stability of compound groups derived from it is given. It is shown that results of the thermogravimetric composition analysis reflect features of botanical composition of the initial peat. Correlation of composition mass lost in the low-temperature area (from 0 to 400 degrees C) which is followed by two exothermal effects of the macromolecule periphery expansion to weight loss in the high-temperature area (from 400 to 800 degrees C) having one pronounced exothermal effect of core expansion is revealed. Mean smallest value of these relations (Z) for composition of scheuchzerite peat also makes 0,59, then in the increasing sequence: compositions of sphagnous phuscum peat (0,66), complex (0,67), scheuchzerite-sphagnous (0,69) and sphagnous matted peat (0,70) follow. The less this relation is, the higher thermal stability of a macromolecule composition is. Maximum temperatures of the researched peat composition destruction in high-temperature area which mean values vary from 497,3 to 521,2 degrees C are set and show correlative dependence with Z index. It is defined that composition structure and properties changes under the influence of heating in the samples taken from peat of small decomposition extent are more expressed.

AB Global changes in climate and land use are occurring at an unprecedented rate, often triggering drastic shifts in plant communities. This study aims to reconstruct the changes that occurred over 35 years in the plant communities of temperate bogs subjected to indirect human-induced disturbances. In 2015-17, we resurveyed the vascular flora of 76 plots located in 16 bogs of southern Quebec (Canada) first sampled in 1982. We evaluated changes in species richness, frequency of occurrence and abundance, while considering species shade-tolerance and preferential habitat. We calculated beta diversity as between-site similarities in composition, and evaluated differences between the two surveys using tests for homogeneity in multivariate dispersion. We found a significant increase in species richness and beta diversity over the last 35 years associated with major species turnovers, indicating a biotic differentiation of the Sphagnum-bog plant communities. These changes were mostly associated with an increase in the abundance and frequency of shade-tolerant and facultative species, suggesting a global phenomenon of woody encroachment. Because the observed changes occurred in a few decades on sites free of in situ human disturbances, we suggest that they were likely induced by the synergic effect of the agricultural drainage occurring in the surrounding mineral soils, climate warming, and nitrogen atmospheric depositions. We also believe that further changes are to be expected, as the triggering factors persist. Finally, our results highlight the need for increased bog conservation or restauration efforts. Indeed, a rise in beta diversity due to the introduction of nearby terrestrial species could induce biotic homogenization of the bog flora with that of surrounding habitats and ultimately impoverish the regional species pool.

AB Climate warming increases nitrogen (N) mineralization in superficial soil layers (the dominant rooting zone) of subarctic peatlands. Thawing and subsequent mineralization of permafrost increases plant-available N around the thaw-front. Because plant production in these peatlands is N-limited, such changes may substantially affect net primary production and species composition. We aimed to identify the potential impact of increased N-availability due to permafrost thawing on subarctic peatland plant production and species performance, relative to the impact of increased N-availability in superficial organic layers. Therefore, we investigated whether plant roots are present at the thaw-front (45 cm depth) and whether N-uptake (N-15-tracer) at the thaw-front occurs during maximum thaw-depth, coinciding with the end of the growing season. Moreover, we performed a unique 3-year belowground fertilization experiment with fully factorial combinations of deep-(thaw-front) and shallow-fertilization (10 cm depth) and controls. We found that certain species are present with roots at the thaw-front (Rubus chamaemorus) and have the capacity (R. chamaemorus, Eriophorum vaginatum) for N-uptake from the thaw-front between autumn and spring when aboveground tissue is largely senescent. In response to 3-year shallow-belowground fertilization (S) both shallow-(Empetrum hermaphroditum) and deep-rooting species increased aboveground biomass and N-content, but only deep-rooting species responded positively to enhanced nutrient supply at the thaw-front (D). Moreover, the effects of shallow-fertilization and thaw-front fertilization on aboveground biomass production of the deep-rooting species were similar in magnitude (S: 71%; D: 111% increase compared to control) and additive (S + D: 181% increase). Our results show that plant-available N released from thawing permafrost can form a thus far overlooked additional N-source for deep-rooting subarctic plant species and increase their biomass production beyond the already established impact of warming-driven enhanced shallow N-mineralization. This may result in shifts in plant community composition and may partially counteract the increased carbon losses from thawing permafrost.

AB Peatland drainage is an important driver of global soil carbon loss and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Restoration of peatlands by reflooding reverses CO2 losses at the cost of increased methane (CH4) emissions, presenting a biogeochemical compromise. While restoring peatlands is a potentially effective method for sequestering carbon, the terms of this compromise are not well constrained. Here we present 14 site years of continuous CH4 and CO2 ecosystem-scale gas exchange over a network of restored freshwater wetlands in California, where long growing seasons, warm weather, and managed water tables result in some of the largest wetland ecosystem CH4 emissions recorded. These large CH4 emissions cause the wetlands to be strong greenhouse gas sources while sequestering carbon and building peat soil. The terms of this biogeochemical compromise, dictated by the ratio between carbon sequestration and CH4 emission, vary considerably across small spatial scales, despite nearly identical wetland climate, hydrology, and plant community compositions.
   Plain Language Summary Wetlands play an important role in the climate system, with restoration commonly undertaken for the benefit of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal and carbon storage in the soil. While flooded conditions suppress carbon dioxide emissions from decomposition and sequester carbon, they also generate methane, another potent heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Understanding the balance between these exchanges is important to our understanding of how restored or created wetlands will contribute to mitigating climate change. Here we present a long-term record of continuous carbon dioxide and methane exchange from restored wetlands in Northern California to understand the ultimate climate impact of wetland restoration.

AB A peat core from a Swiss bog represents 2110 C-14 years of peat accumulation and provides a Continuous record of atmospheric rare earth element (REE) deposition. This is the first studs providing a time-series of all REE originating from the atmosphere. Concentrations of the 14 REE (La. Ce. Pr, Nd. Sm. Eu, Gd. Tb. D, Ho, Er. Tm, Yb and Lu) were determined using inductively Coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after dissolution of 200 mg aliquots of age-dated peat samples with 3 nil HNO3 and 0.1 ml HBF4 at 240 degreesC in a microwave autoclave. Strict quality control schemes were applied to ensure the accuracy of the applied analytical methodology. Previous analyses of selected REE by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) in the same set of peat samples repealed that INAA frequently under- or overestimated REE concentrations ill a systematic manner. Concentration profiles obtained for all REE ere almost identical. except for Cc and Eu. Calculation of enrichment factors (EF) revealed a distinct depletion of heavy REE relative to light REE in peat samples since the beginning of the 19th century which marks the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Europe. suggesting a pronounced influence by anthropogenic activities. Enrichments of REE calculated using Sc as a reference element exceeded unity. relative to the Upper Continental Crust. Overall. EF in all peat samples ranged from 1.96 for Sin to 2.34 for Gd. with considerably lower EF for Cc (1,82) and Eu ( 1.44). respectively. A significant enrichment of all REE which may hake been caused by military activities. was observed in the peat sample dating from World War II (1944): this exceptional sample. however, is not enriched in Ce. The concentration profiles of REE were similar but not identical to those of other lithogenic, conservative reference elements such as Sc, Y, Al. Zr and Ti. While it has been Suggested that individual REE concentrations or the sum of REE can be used as a reference parameter to calculate crustal EF in environmental samples the data presented here indicates that anthropogenic emissions of REE cannot simply be ignored.

AB PurposeWetlands have a critical impact on the global carbon cycle. This study aims to investigate the spatial and vertical distribution of the soil organic carbon concentration (SOCc), to identify the differences of SOCc among swamps, marshes, bogs, and fens at a regional scale, and finally to examine the main environmental factors impacting SOCc at different depth intervals within different wetland types located in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM).Materials and methodsA total of 218 soil samples were collected. SOCc was determined by the combustion-oxidation method. To analyze the impacts of wetland type, soil type, mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), evapotranspiration (ET), elevation (EL), and slope (SL) on SOCc, statistical analysis methods were executed, including ANOVA with the Duncan test, Pearson correlations analysis, and the stepwise multiple regressions analysis.Results and discussionThe mean values of SOCc in the 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100-cm intervals were 130.4, 64.2, and 32.6gkg(-1), respectively. The wetland type played an important role in the pattern of SOCc in terms of significant differences (p<0.05) among the different wetland types in the 0-60-cm depth. However, significant differences were not found among different soil types. In terms of the wetland type, the highest SOCc was found in bogs (p<0.05), probably due to the higher MAP and lower MAT. The increased MAP (R-2=0.1369, p<0.01) and decreased MAT (R-2=0.1225, p<0.01) had positive associations on the wetland SOCc. ET (R-2=0.2809, p<0.01), MAP (R-2=0.2025, p<0.01), and EL (R-2=0.0484, p<0.05) were positively correlated with marsh SOCc. Moreover, MAP was positively correlated with the bog SOCc (R-2=0.1296, p<0.01). For vertical patterns, SOCc was higher in the 0-30-cm interval and decreased with depth. The impacts of environmental factors on SOCc decreased with depth for each wetland type. Models were developed to document the relations between the SOCc of marshes and fens and corresponding environmental factors.ConclusionsWetland types largely differed in the soil carbon pools in the GKM of China. The relative importance of environmental factors was different for the SOCc values of various wetland types. To minimize carbon loss into the atmosphere, more protections are required for wetlands, especially in the 0-30-cm depth interval because it contains higher SOCc values and is more vulnerable and less stable than those in the deeper layers.

TI COAL FACIES INTERPRETATIONS BASED ON LITHOTYPE AND MACERAL VARIATIONS IN
   LOWER CRETACEOUS (GATES FORMATION) COALS OF WESTERN CANADA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SEAM; PETROGRAPHY; BASINS
AB Maceral analyses of lithotype samples from Lower Cretaceous coal seams have been used to define compositional characteristics of the various lithotypes and to assess coal facies changes within the seams based on maceral and lithotype variations.
   The mean petrographic compositions of the lithotypes show a general trend to decreasing vitrinite, increasing inertinite and increasing mineral matter contents from the bright to dull varieties. The bright lithotypes are considered to have been formed in wet and densely forested swamps, whereas the banded lithotypes were formed under somewhat drier conditions. Within the dull lithotype two distinct types were recognized based on differences in petrographic composition and the occurrence or absence of facies diagnostic macerals. It is suggested that these differences are due to formation in distinct mire facies, under the influence of open moor or raised mire conditions.
   The lithotype variations within the seams, together with the data on their petrographic composition, were used to define facies changes, which occurred during accumulation of the peats. Three types of seam development are recognized:  (a) seams containing a high proportion of clastic beds indicative of frequent floodings of the swamps. These seams are characterized by the dominance of oscillatory sequences of bright lithotypes and dulling upward sequences below clastic beds. The brighter lithotypes were formed in forested swamps and fens, whereas for the duller sequences influences of open moor conditions are indicated; (b) seams containing only minor thin clastic beds indicating relative stability of water levels during formation of the peat. These seams are characterized by the predominance of duller lithotypes with common repetitions of dulling upward sequences. The dulling up sequences indicate transitions from wet and very wet forest swamps to drier conditions with lower tree density; (c) transitional seams characterized by a few clastic beds. These seams formed under intermediate conditions of stability in respect to flooding events. The seams are characterized by the predominance of banded lithotypes, dull lithotypes near partings and brightening and dulling up sequences. The brightening up sequences represent transitions from dry forest swamp to wet and very wet forest swamps, while a reverse trend is indicated for the dulling up sequences.
   The overall petrographic characteristics of full seam sections indicate that the seams are in general relatively low in vitrinite and relatively rich in inertinite macerals. Liptinite content is negligible and mineral matter contents are low. Based on petrographic indices obtained from facies diagnostic macerals, an accumulation of the ancient peats under prevailing wet to very wet forest swamps is suggested. Vicinity to more open moor conditions is indicated for one seam by the higher input of dispersed macerals.

AB Calluna vulgaris can and does grow in areas considered unsuitable for production of biomass crops. In the UK, Calluna vegetation is regularly controlled by burn management and if instead the lost biomass could be harvested would it represent a viable energy crop? This study used established techniques for other energy crops to assess the energy yield, energy efficiency and the greenhouse gas savings represented by cropping of Calluna under two scenarios; only harvested on the area currently under burn management; and harvested on the present total area of Calluna in the UK. The study can consider biomass potential across the UK and can include altitude changes. The study can show that Calluna would represent an efficient energy crop in areas where it would not be possible to revert to functioning peat bogs. The energy efficiency was 65 +/- 19 GJ(output) GJ(input)(-1) with GHG savings of up to 11 tonnes CO2eq, ha(-1) yr(-1). When considered across the UK the potential energy production was up to 40.7 PJ yr(-1) and the potential greenhouse gas saving was upto -2061 ktonnes CO2eq yr(-1) if the all Calluna could be brought into production and substituted for coal.

AB As an important long-term terrestrial carbon sequestration mechanism, biogeochemical sequestration of carbon within phytoliths may play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and climate change. The aim of this study is to explore the potential of carbon bio-sequestration within phytoliths produced by wetland plants. The results show that the occluded carbon content of phytoliths in wetland plants ranges from 0.49% to 3.97%, with a CV (coefficient of variation) value of 810%. The data also indicate that the phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) content of biomass for wetland plants depends not only on the phytolith content of biomass, but also the efficiency of carbon occlusion within phytoliths during plant growth in herb-dominated fens. The fluxes of carbon bio-sequestration within phytoliths of herb-dominated fen plants range from 0.003 to 0.077 t CO2 equivalents t-e-CO2 ha(-1) a(-1). In China, 0.04x10(6) to 1.05x10(6) t CO2 equivalents per year may be sequestrated in phytoliths of herbaceous-dominated fen plants. Globally, taking a fen area of 1.48x10(8) ha and the largest phytolith carbon biosequestration flux (0.077 t-e-CO2 ha(-1) a(-1)) for herb-dominated fen plants, about 1.14x10(7) t CO2 equivalents per year would have been sequestrated in phytoliths of fen plants. If other wetland plants have similar PhytOC production flux with herb-dominated fen plants (0.077 t-e-CO2 ha(-1) a(-1)), about 4.39x10(7) t-e-CO2 a(-1) may be sequestrated in the phytoliths of world wetland plants. The data indicate that the management of wetland ecosystems (e.g. selection of plant species) to maximize the production of PhytOC have the potential to bio-sequestrate considerable quantities of atmospheric CO2.

AB To understand the seasonality of methane flux from alpine wetlands in Zoige Plateau, 30 plots were set to measure the methane emissions in the growing and nongrowing seasons in three environmental types: dry hummock (DH), Carex muliensis (CM), and Eleocharis valleculosa (EV) sites. There were clearly seasonal patterns of methane flux in different environmental types in the growing and nongrowing seasons. Mean methane emission rate was 14.45 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (0.17 to 86.78 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) in the growing season, and 0.556 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (0.002 to 6.722 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) in the nongrowing season. In the growing season, the main maximum values of methane flux were found in July and August, except for a peak value in September in CM sites. In the nongrowing season, the similar seasonal variation pattern was shared among all the three sites, in which the methane emissions increased from February to April. In the growing season, the determining factors were surface temperatures (r(2) = 0.55, P < 0.05), standing water depths (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.01) and plant community heights (r(2) = 0.61, P < 0.01), while in the nongrowing season, ice thickness (r(2) = 0.27, P < 0.05; in CM and EV sites) was found most related to flux. In our understanding, the seasonality of methane emissions in our study areas was temperature- and-plant-growth-dependent, and the water table position was also very important to shape the temperature- and-plant-growth-dependent seasonal variation of flux with its vigorous variations in alpine wetland ecosystems. Different environmental types within the wetland also influenced the seasonal pattern of methane flux. For an accurate estimate of the global methane source strength of alpine wetlands, the pronounced seasonal or even temporal variability in methane emission from alpine wetlands should be taken into consideration.

AB The results of investigations (SEM/EDS and AAS) of a peat deposit, spanning 13,000 years of peat accumulation, are shown. The peat deposit is located in a region of shallow occurrence of Zn-Pb ores, near Tarnowskie Gry town, within the Cracow-Silesia district (southern Poland). Exploitation of lead, silver and iron during the medieval times (Twelfth and thirteenth century) was confirmed by historical documents whereas there are no unambiguous data showing that there was metal mining during the Romanian or earlier times in the region. The peat deposit is located within the influence of atmospheric Pb and Zn emission from a nearby Zn-Pb smelter. Two vertical peat profiles were investigated (120 and 140 cm depth of profile) showing variable concentrations of Zn up to 713 mg kg(-1), Pb up to 317 mg kg(-1), Cd up to 13 mg kg(-1) and Tl up to 31 mg kg(-1). The highest concentrations were recorded for the uppermost peat layers. SEM and EDS investigations revealed the occurrence of metalbearing, submicroscopic mineral components: Fe, Mn, Ti and Zn oxides and Zn and Pb carbonates. The top layer of the deposit contained Zn, Pb and Cd sulphides. The occurrence of aggregates of Au-Ag, Cu-Zn and Au-Ag-Cu alloys can be possibly related to pre-historical mining and smelting or be explained by geochemical transformations. The preservation of carbonates and oxides in the peat is discussed, indicating a generally neutral to alkaline peat water chemistry and maintenance of an oxidized environment in the fen.

AB To understand the implications of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on carbon turnover in peatlands, we conducted a C-13 pulse labeling experiment on Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum already receiving long-term (5 years) amendments of 56 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) as ammonium or nitrate. We examined shoot tissue retention, net ecosystem respiration returns of the C-13 pulse, and soil porewater DOC content under the two species. C-13 fixation in Eriophorum leaves was enhanced with nitrogen addition and doubled with nitrate supply. This newly fixed C appeared to be relocated below-ground faster with nitrogen fertilization as respiration returns were unaffected by N inputs. By contrast, increases in C-13 fixation were not observed in Calluna. Instead, net ecosystem respiration rates over Calluna increased with N fertilization. There was no significant label incorporation into DOC, suggesting a conservative strategy of peatland vegetation regarding allocation of C through root exudation. Greater concentrations of total DOC were identified with nitrate addition in Calluna. Given the long-term nature of the experiment and the high N inputs, the overall impacts of nitrogen amendments on the fate of recently synthesized C in Eriophorum and Calluna in this ombrotrophic peatland were surprisingly more moderate than originally hypothesized. This may be due to N being effectively retained within the bryophyte layer, thus limiting, and delaying the onset of, below-ground effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drained organic soils are anthropogenic emission hotspots of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Most studies have focused on deep peat soils and on peats with high organic carbon content. In contrast, histic Gleysols are characterized by shallow peat layers, which are left over from peat cutting activities or by peat mixed with mineral soil. It is unknown whether they emit less GHGs than deep Histosols when drained. We present the annual carbon and GHG balance of grasslands for six sites on nutrient-poor histic Gleysols with a shallow (30 cm) histic horizon or mixed with mineral soil in Northern Germany (soil organic carbon concentration (C-org)from 9 to 52%).
   The net GHG balance, corrected for carbon export by harvest, was around 4 t CO2-C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) on soils with peat layer and little drainage (mean annual water table < 20 cm below surface). The net GHG balance reached 7- 9 t CO2-C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) on soils with sand mixed into the peat layer and water tables between 14 cm and 39 cm below surface. GHG emissions from drained histic Gleysols (i)wereas high as those from deep Histosols, (ii) increase linearly from shallow to deeper drainage, (iii) but are not affected by C-org content of the histic horizon. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was linearly correlated with water table level even if it was below the histic horizon. The R-eco/GPP ratio was 1.5 at all sites, so that we ruled out a major influence of the inter-site variability in vegetation composition on annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE).
   The IPCC definition of organic soils includes shallow histic topsoil, unlike most national and international definitions of Histosols. Our study confirms that this broader definition is appropriate considering anthropogenic GHG emissions from drained organic soils. Countries currently apply soil maps in national GHG inventories which are likely not to include histic Gleysols. The land area with GHG emission hotspots due to drainage is likely to be much higher than anticipated.
   Deeply drained histic Gleysols are GHG hotspots that have so far been neglected or underestimated. Peat mixing with sand does not mitigate GHG emissions. Our study implies that rewetting organic soils, including histic Gleysols, has a much higher relevance for GHG mitigation strategies than currently recognized.

AB Drained peatland forests form an important timber resource in Finland. They also form a sink for atmospheric carbon (C) because of the increased growth and C sequestration rates following drainage. These rates have, however, been poorly quantified. We simulated the tree stand dynamics for drained peatland stands with and without cuttings over two stand rotations. Simulations were done on four peatland site types and two regions in Finland with different climatic conditions, using recently published peatland tree growth models applied in a stand simulator. We then calculated the amount of C stored in the stands on the basis of previously published tree-level biomass and C content models. Finally, we developed regression models to estimate C stores in the tree stands using stand stem volume as the predictor variable. In the managed stands, the mean growth (annual volume increment) ranged from 2 to 9 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), depending on the rotation (first/second), site type and region. Total yield during one rotation varied from 250 to 970 m(3) ha(-1). The maximum stand volumes varied from 220 to 520 m(3) ha(-1) in the managed stands and from 360 to 770 m(3) ha(-1) in the unmanaged. By the end of the first post-drainage rotation the total C store in the managed stands had increased by 6-12 kg C m(-2) (i.e. 45-140 g C m(-2) a(-1)) compared to that in the undrained situation. Averaged over two rotations, the increase in the total C store was 3-6 kg C m(-2). in the corresponding unmanaged stands the C stores increased by 8-15 kg m(-2) over the same periods. At stand level, the C stores were almost linearly related to the stern volume and the developed regression equations could explain the variation in the simulated C stores almost entirely.

AB Organic fades analyses quantify the coal constituents and plot various associations to discriminate the paleoenvironment for coal bearing successions. This allows the relation of coal composition to mire ecosystems or environments. Coal petrographic models are used extensively to reconstruct the nature of ancient peat forming environments. Many authors proposed relations between specific maceral assemblages and/or micro-lithotypes and peat forming environments. The key controlling factors which affect peat environment include hydrogeology, redox, pH, vegetation type, clastic influx, sedimentation and peat accumulation rate etc. Recent advancements in coal maceral study and organic petrology reveal the pros and cons of the available indices and models. The main reasons for the failure of the petrographic models are over-simplification of the effects of humification on tissue preservation vs. destruction, the use of post-diagenetic processes (e.g., geochemical gelification) in determining depositional environments, changes in petrographic composition related to floral evolution, geological age, rank increase and compaction, lack of distinction between different inertnite maceral in some models. Here the widely used petrographic indices and models are reviewed based on the observations of several workers and the applicability and concepts of paleo-environmental reconstruction are discussed. A multi-disciplinary approach including petrography, palynology, chemistry etc. has been recommended, which is more logical and scientific than the exclusive use of petrographic composition for paleoenvironmental interpretation.

AB Peat records enable the reconstruction of changes in the global biogeochemical mineral dust cycle and the detection of variations in atmospheric circulation patterns during the Holocene. They can therefore provide a key tool for understanding the relationship between the geochemical dust cycle and past climate change. Here, we present the first detailed study of the inorganic geochemistry of a peat core collected at an altitude of 3500 m from the Hongyuan peatland, on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and test its potential as an archive of atmospheric dust deposition. We find that the low accumulation rates of the peat and the presence of the extensive dust sources of northern China in the vicinity of the study site lead to approximately five times higher concentrations of mineral matter compared to temperate ombrotrophic peats. A detailed geochemical assessment of the core and surface samples from local and non-local dust sources, as well as of the hydrology and hydrochemistry of the surrounding waters, suggests that external and internal post-depositional processes have not affected the record of lithogenic elements, including the rare earth elements (REE), Sc, Y and Th.
   Changes in Ti-normalized major element profiles, La/Yb, Y/Tb and the Eu anomaly identify seven major shifts among the dominant dust sources and therefore potential changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. Bivariate plots using the REE-based tracers La/Yb, Y/Tb, La/Th, Y/Er, Sc/La, Th/Sc and Th/RREE suggest that the Taklamakan desert and the Chinese loess plateau in northern China were the dominant non-local dust sources to the peat. Local dust input dominated throughout the early Holocene until 4.9 kyr BP. Increased dust input from the non-local sources thereafter suggests an enhanced influence of winds associated with the East Asian winter monsoon and the Westerly jet throughout most of the late Holocene. Sharp increases in non-local dust fluxes between 3.1-2.7 and between 1.3-0.9 kyr BP suggest a particular strengthening of these wind systems during these times, in agreement with the organic characteristics of the core.
   Our results show that the Hongyuan peat is a reliable archive to study dust deposition in central Asia and allows the identification of changes in atmospheric circulation patterns and in the larger climatic arrangements of the monsoon system in this region during the Holocene.

AB Tree trunks and wood fragments in minerotrophic fen peat that accumulated as the result of a jokulhlaup in the outwash plain of Unteraarglacier were radiocarbon-dated using conventional beta-counting. Different pretreatment methods were tested on two wood samples to determine the reliability of our dates. We dated the wood compounds after extended acid-alkali-acid treatment, as wall as extraction of cellulose and lignin. The results of the samples Picea (B-6687) and Pinus cembra (B-6699) show insignificant differences of < 1 sigma.
   The C-14 dates represent retreat of Unteraarglacier due to warmer and/or drier phases in the Holocene compared to modern climate conditions. The glacier was at least several hundred meters smaller in extent than today ca. 8100-7670 BP, 6175-5780 BP, 4580-4300 BP, 4100-3600 BP and 3380-3200 BP. The C-14 dates suggest a ca. 2000-yr cyclicity of tree growth in the area covered by the present Unteraarglacier. The most intense warm and dry period occurred between 4100 BP (probably extending back to 4580 BP) and 3600 BP, with growth of fen peat between 3800 and 3600 BP attributed to wetter conditions.

AB A continuous peat bog section from a barely accessible mid-mountain area in the northwestern Baikal region has been obtained for the first time. The materials were studied by methods such as pollen-spore analysis, analysis of plant cell remains, and radiocarbon dating (calibrated data). The smallest peat accumulation rates in East Siberia during the Holocene are revealed. In accordance with the calculated peat accumulation rates, the time resolution is 100 years in the lower part of the section, it is while up to 800 years in the upper one. Six local palynozones and five botanic zones have been distinguished using factor analysis. The vegetation cover changes and environmental moisture conditions for the last 7670 years are reconstructed. The altitude of the forest line is specified for the first time in a quarter of a century.

AB Annual and seasonal variations in precipitation have been shown to influence the hydrology of nontidal wetlands, including depth to water table. Water-table depth is assessed in wetlands for a variety of reasons, most notably for wetland delineations or determining the success of restoration projects. Many short-term assessment efforts probably occur during periods of abnormal precipitation and, as such, may not provide a thorough understanding of wetland hydrology. I have been evaluating water-table dynamics of a wetlands complex in western North Carolina for seven years in support of a wetlands restoration project. A series of water-table wells and piezometers were installed to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of the water table and vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG). For over three years, the area was classified as having conditions of moderate to severe drought. The drought lowered the average monthly water table by 26 cm in a mountain fen and 22 cm in the adjacent floodplain. The fen was a constant ground-water recharge area before the drought and a discharge area for three of 12 months during the drought. The drought also impacted a shallow, constant ground-water source to the fen on an adjacent hillslope. The impacts of the drought were greater during the active growing season, presumably due to increased evapotranspiration. The results support the need for long-term hydrologic assessment of wetlands and the need to relate wetland hydrology to annual, seasonal, and monthly precipitation patterns.

AB [ 1] Coastal wetlands are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, the dynamics of carbon ( C) cycling in coastal wetlands and its response to sea level change associated with global warming is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the long-term and short-term rates of C accumulation, using C and C isotopic measurements of peat cores collected along a soil chronosequence, in a coastal wetland in north Florida. The long-term C accumulation rates determined by examining the C inventory and the radioactive decay of radiocarbon as a function of depth in the peat cores decrease with time from -130 +/- 9 g C/m(2)/yr over the last century to -13 +/- 2 g C/m(2)/yr over the millennium timescale. The short-term C accumulation rates estimated by examining the differences in the radiocarbon and C contents of the surfacial peat between archived ( 1985, 1988) and present ( 1996 and 1997) samples range from 42 to 193 g C/m(2)/yr in low marsh, from 18 to 184 g C/m(2)/yr in middle marsh, and from -50 to 181 g C/m(2)/yr in high marsh. The high end-values of our estimated short-term C accumulation rates are comparable to the estimated rates of C sequestration in coastal wetlands reported by Chmura et al. [ 2003], but are significantly higher than our estimated long-term rates in the marshes and are also much higher than the published rates of C sequestration in northern peatlands. The higher recent rates of C accumulation in coastal marshes, in comparison with the longer-term rates, are due to slow but continuous decomposition of organic matter in the peat over time. However, other factors such as increased primary production in the coastal wetland over the last decades or century, due to a rise in mean sea level and/or CO2 and nitrogen fertilization effect, could also have contributed to the large difference between the recent and longer-term rates. Our data indicate that salt marshes in this area have been and continue to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of higher rates of C sequestration and lower CH4 emissions, coastal wetlands could be more valuable C sinks per unit area than other ecosystems in a warmer world.

AB The seasonal and spatial changes of content and composition of dissolved organic carbon in water flowing out from bog were studied. Water was sampled from the Kuke River flowing out from Koigi Bog (eastern Saaremaa, Estonia) and in comparison the water samples from the bog lake (Lake Pitkjarv) were analyzed regularly during 18 months. Absorptions of water samples were measured at 250, 254, 285, 365 and 436 nm on UV-Vis spectrophotometer and pH, conductivity and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured. Specific ultraviolet absorptions (SUVA) and the ratios of absorptions were calculated to characterize the nature of dissolved organic carbons. The significant changes of the concentration of DOC were determined in water sampled from the Kuke River during the dry days, but it was much steadier during rest sampling time. Analysis of water from the Lake Pitkjarv showed relatively high content of macromolecular organic compounds rich in aromatics (SUVA(254) = 4.58 L mg(-1) m(-1)), whereas water samples from the Kuke River contained predominantly more homogeneous low-molecular-weight materials poor in aromatics (SUVA(254) = 2.96 L mg(-1) m(-1)). Calculated values of SUVA(285) confirmed that organic carbon in river water can be also originated from the decomposition of root litter. The values of ratio of UVA(250)/A(365) for water samples from Kuke River indicated the fulvic nature of DOC as conformed by the SUVA(254) and SUVA(285) values. The values of A(254)/A(436) for river were higher than 14 indicating that the organic matter in water from lake and river contained lots of UV absorbing functional groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Fushun Basin in northeast China is a strike-slip basin filled with coal-bearing Eocene sediments. The basin fill includes from base to top volcaniclastic rocks, a 20 to 145 m thick coal seam (Lower Eocene Guchengzi Formation) and lacustrine oil shale, up to 300 m thick (Jijuntun Formation). The sub-bituminous coal of the Guchengzi Formation, famous for the amber inclusions, is exploited in the largest opencast coal and oil shale mine in Asia. In the present contribution the depositional environment and the thermal history of the Guchengzi Formation are investigated based on macro- and micropetrographic data, bulk geochemical parameters, biomarker analysis, stable isotope geochemistry, and vitrinite reflectance measurements. According to our interpretation, accumulation of the low-sulfur coal commenced in a low-lying mire near a shallow lake. Subsequently low-ash coal was deposited either in a low-lying mire protected from clastic influx or in a raised mire. Finally, high subsidence rates, typical for strike-slip basins, caused the flooding of the mire and terminated peat accumulation. Pristane/phytane ratios suggest a gradual change from oxic to less oxic conditions during the drowning phase of the seam. Organic-rich shales accumulated in the newly formed freshwater lake and resulted in the deposition of the overlying oil shale-bearing Jijuntun Formation. The coal is rich in liptinite macerals, especially sporinite. Gymnosperms dominated the paleovegetation of the mire, something that is also reflected by the frequent occurrence of resinite and amber and their biomarker composition. The coal reached the sub-bituminous or even the high volatile bituminous stage, despite the limited burial depth. Simple 1D models suggest that this is a result of high heat flow, rather than of deep burial and erosion. The hydrogen-rich coal is oil-prone. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Much of the conifer plantation forest in Ireland is on peat soils. Plantations on this soil type are known to pose the greatest risk to degrading water quality by increased sedimentation, acidification and heavy metal accumulation. Peat soils are also known to leach phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a result of forestry operations. In moderation, such nutrient enrichment may have positive trophic impacts in oligotrophic freshwater systems such as those typical of peat catchments in western Ireland.
   In this study, the water chemistry and brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations of peat-land lakes were investigated to assess the associations of conifer plantation forest on the growth, energetics and population structure of brown trout. We conducted this study over a three-month period in the summer of 2010 by comparing brown trout populations and water chemistry in lakes with three distinct catchment land uses: (i) unplanted blanket bog, (ii) moderate levels of conifer plantation forest (30-40% of catchment afforested), and (iii) high levels of conifer plantation forest (80-90% of catchment afforested).
   Changes in hydrochemistry associated with conifer plantations resulted in elevated concentrations of N, P and DOC, but no change to pH, with increasing levels of plantation forest within the catchment. Whereas there was no consistent trend in brown trout density between land uses, highest densities were recorded in lakes with afforested catchments. Trout populations in lakes with afforested catchments were dominated by younger fish, primarily 1+ (year old) and 2+ (2 year old) individuals with some 0+ (young of the year) trout present, compared to control lakes, which were largely dominated by 2+ and 3+ (3 year old) individuals.
   Older age classes of trout had larger body sizes in lakes with high levels of plantation forest within the catchment relative to the other lakes, indicating higher empirical growth rates, likely due to the trophic enrichment effects of forestry. Brown trout specific growth models that incorporate the potential confounding influence of different temperature regimes, showed no consistent relationship between growth and forest cover over the study period. Food consumption models indicated that trout in all sites were energetically challenged during the summer when sampling took place. Discrepancies between the observed body size and estimated growth of trout in lakes may potentially be due to (a) a significant amount of growth occurring outside of the summer study period and/or (b) unusually elevated temperature regimes during the study period, particularly in the afforested sites.
   No negative impacts of conifer plantation forests on brown trout populations were recorded. However, forest managers may wish to minimise felling coupe within peatland plantations as felling operations may exacerbate nutrient and/or heavy ion input into aquatic systems in such catchments.

AB Methane production and methane oxidation potential were measured in a 30 cm pat core from the Moorhouse Nature Reserve, UK. The distribution of known groups of methanogens and methane oxidizing bacteria throughout this peat core was assessed. Using 16S rRNA gene retrieval and functional gene probing with genes encoding key proteins in methane oxidation and methanogenesis, several major groups of microorganisms were detected. Methane production and oxidation was detected in all depths of the peat core. PCR amplification and oligonucleotide probing experiments using DNA isolated from all sections of the peat core detected methanotrophs from the groups Methylosinus and Methylococcus and methanogens from the groups Methanosarcinaceae, Methanococcaceae, and Methanobacteriaceae. 16S rDNA sequences amplified with the Methylosinus-specific primer were shown to have a high degree of identity with 16S rDNA sequences previously detected in acidic environments. However, no methanogen sequences were detected by the probes available in this study in the sections of the peat core (above 7 cm) where the majority of methanogenesis occurred, either because of low methanogen numbers or because of the presence of novel methanogen sequences.

AB The objective of the study was to quantify the effect of wood ash on the growth and nutrition of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) on cutaway peatlands in Estonia. Two experimental areas were established: the Ulila experimental area (South Estonia) with treatments of 5 and 10 t ha(-1) wood ash and control (unfertilised plot) in 2009 and the Puhatu experimental area (Northeast Estonia) with treatments of 10 and 15 t ha(-1) wood ash and control in 2011. The best results were achieved with the wood ash dose of 10 t ha(-1) on the Ulila area and with 15 t ha(-1) on the Puhatu area, which means that the largest amounts of wood ash applied were the most favourable for the growth of young birches. Fertilisation with wood ash improved the balance of nutrients on the Ulila and Puhatu experimental area: the concentration of extractable P, K, Ca and Mg in the ash-treated peat had significantly increased. Already after the first growing season the annual height increment of trees on the ash-fertilised plots was greater (0.5-0.6 m), than control (3-7 cm) on both experimental areas, during the next two years more than 1 m on the Ulila ash-treated experimental area. The mean root collar diameter of birches on the plot treated with 10 t ha(-1) ash was 3.3 cm on the Ulila experimental area and 1.9 cm on the Puhatu experimental area. In the second year after fertilisation the mean tree biomass was 167.2 g on the treated with 10 t ha(-1) plot while on the control plot the mean tree biomass was only 1.4 g on the Ulila area; in the fourth year the respective biomasses were 961.0 g and 6.3 g on the Ulila experimental area. On the Puhatu experimental area the mean tree biomass was 216.9 g on the plot treated with 15 t ha(-1) and 9.6 g on the control plot in the second year. In the second year the mean annual biomass increment on the treated with 10 t ha(-1) at Ulila was 136 g year(-1), and almost the same results were obtained on the Puhatu experimental area with 15 t ha(-1) wood ash treatment. On the Ulila experimental area the root mass ratio was higher on the control than on the ash-fertilised plots, but on the Puhatu experimental area the root mass ratio did not statistically differ between the treatments. On the plots treated with higher amount of wood ash a significant increase in the concentration of elements dominating in wood ash (P, K, Ca) was observed in assimilating organs.

AB Subsidence, erosion, and degradation in agricultural peatlands are leading to the disappearance of highly fertile farmland. This study investigated two strategies aimed at extending the lifespan of cultivated peat soils: the application of straw and wood chips to compensate for soil losses and the application of copper (Cu) to slow peat decomposition, based on previous recommendations. Peat soil samples (270 g) were amended with 11 t ha(-1) of biomass materials (14.8 g kg(-1)) and 235.6 mg Cu kg(-1) and incubated in glass jars at constant temperature and water content. Thirty chemical parameters were then monitored over a 56-d period through repeated soil sampling. Discriminant analysis showed that the addition of biomass had the greatest affect on nitrogen (N) availability, immobilizing 7.8 to 12.1 kg of inorganic N per metric ton of incorporated biomass. Considering that peat soils may require from 4 to 40 t biomass ha(-1) yr(-1) to reach carbon equilibrium, the tested biomass materials could immobilize from 34 to 500 kg ha(-1) of N if confirmed at the field scale. This may help capture excess N but may also limit crop growth. Alternatively, slowing decomposition could reduce both biomass requirements and N immobilization. However, the results show that Cu had little effect on parameters linked to organic matter decomposition. Indeed, dissolved organic carbon was decreased by 11% in Cu-treated soils. A longer-term study should be conducted to confirm these observations at the field scale, thus helping to develop conservation strategies suitable for agricultural production.

AB We analyzed the fossil insect fauna of a palsa peatland located 10 km south and east of the treeline in subarctic Quebec (57 degrees 45'N, 76 degrees 15'W) to detect any changes in the species composition during the Holocene epoch and to infer past environmental conditions in the study area. A minimum of 802 beetle individuals were recovered from a 2-m pear section, representing 51 taxa (18 identified to the species level) and 8 families. Trechus crassiscapus, Eucnecosum brunnescens, and Olophrum rotundicolle were the most common species found in the peat. The insect assemblage was quite stable through the study interval (5850-1950 BP). The formation of the palsa (where the peat section was excavated) occurred probably after 1950 BP, raising the soil surface above water level and preventing additional peat accumulation. The proportion of boreal forest species in the faunal assemblage is high (88%). The only arctic (tundra) species found were Amara alpina and Pterostichus arcticola. Many species were out of their modern distribution range, but since collection localities are scarce in subarctic Quebec, the modern range of these species may extend to the study site. A mutual climatic range analysis, employing beetles identified to the species level, showed that the mean July temperature of the study area between 5850 and 1950 BP was possibly 2.8-5.5 degrees C higher than during the 20th century. This assertion is supported by other paleoecological data (pollen and charcoal remains) suggesting a cooling trend in the study area after 2000 BP. However, since the last 2000 years are missing from the sampled peat section, it was not possible to quantify the impact of the cooling trend on the beetle fauna.

AB Potential changes in both the intensity and frequency of extreme drought events are vital aspects of regional climate change that can alter the distribution and dynamics of water availability and subsequently affect carbon cycles at the ecosystem level. The effects of extreme drought events on the carbon budget of peatland in the Zoige plateau and its response mechanisms were studied using an in-field controlled experimental method. The results indicated that the peatland ecosystem of the Zoige plateau functioned as a carbon sink while under the control (CK) or extreme drought (D) treatment throughout the entire growing season. Maximum fluxes of methane (CH4) emissions and the weakest carbon sink activity from this ecosystem were in the early growth stage, the most powerful carbon sink activity was during the peak growth stage, while the absorption sink activity of carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 was present during the senescence stage. Extreme drought reduced the gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-e) of the peatland ecosystem by 14.5% and 12.6%, respectively (p < 0.05) and the net ability to store carbon was reduced by 11.3%. Overall, the GPP was highly sensitive to extreme drought. Moreover, extreme drought significantly reduced the CH4 fluxes of the ecosystem and even changed the peatland from a CH4 emission source to a CH4 sink. Subsequent to drought treatment, extreme drought was also shown to have a carry-over effect on the carbon budget of this ecosystem. Soil water content and soil temperature were the main driving factors of carbon budget change in the peatland of the Zoige plateau, but with the increase in soil depth, these driving forces were decreased. The findings indicated that frequent extreme drought events in the future might reduce the net carbon sink function of peatland areas, with an especially strong influence on CO2.

AB Little is known about vegetation changes in Icelandic peatlands in the context of soil chemical properties. By connecting soil chemical and physical characteristics with palaeobotanical data we examined interactions between climate, histosols, vegetation and land use during the Holocene.
   Exchangeable base cations, cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), decomposition rates, using carbon:nitrogen ratio (C:N) and von Post humification, and soil physical properties were determined. Vegetation development was reconstructed based on pollen analysis. The impact of geographic location was examined by comparing results from three sloping fens (coastal, inland and highland fringe).
   Minerogenic content was highest in the proximity of the active volcanic zone, reflected in higher C:N and nutrient content in the histosol profiles of the fens inland and at the highland fringe. The coastal site revealed exceptionally high BS. C:N was either stable throughout the profile or increased with depth. Plant species richness, and evenness based on pollen data, and pollen concentrations were greatest at the site with lowest nutrient levels.
   Minerogenic content facilitates the ability of histosols to bind nutrients. Plant growth is optimised at the sites with lower fertility levels. C:N alone is not a reliable indicator of decomposition rates, but depends on the quality of the organic parent material. Environmental conditions driven by climate changes caused alterations in vegetation and soil properties before the human settlement of Iceland (c. AD 870), but overall the histosols showed resilience towards severe degradation. After the settlement, the histosols struggled to buffer the impact caused by destruction of vegetation and increased erosion. This study increases our understanding of environmental and anthropogenic determinants of soil- and vegetation development.

AB Exposure to sunshine is known to play a role in litter decomposition in some semi-arid areas. The aim of this study was to find out if it also plays a role in higher latitude environments in peat litter decomposition and could contribute to an explanation to the patchy nature of peat litter decomposition. Peat litter from 5 microenvironments (top of slope, bottom of slope, ridge, ryam and hollow) and put out and exposed to the sun or shaded over a summer in Western Siberia, 26 km west of the town of Khanty-Mansiysk. Afterwards the peat litter was incubated in the laboratory - at field capacity or submerged in peat water - and CO2 and methane emission measured. Chemical composition of exposed and control peat litter was also investigated using stepwise extraction.
   The results indicate that exposure to sunlight does increase subsequent decomposition rate in most peat litters when incubated at field capacity, but the difference between the treatments levelled off at the end of the 2 weeks incubation in most peat litter types. The total extra carbon loss was calculated to be up to about 2 mg Cm-2 over a season. When incubated submerged previous photo-exposure had less effect on CO2 evolution then when incubated at field capacity. No methane emission was recorded in any treatment. Some differences in chemical composition between exposed and shaded peat litters were found that could help explain the differences in subsequent decomposition rate. The results indicate that photodegradation could play a role in peat litter decomposition at higher latitudes when peat is disturbed and exposed to sunshine. However, the effect of photo exposure in these areas is much smaller than observed in semi-arid areas at lower latitudes.

AB Here we present results from a total of 10 peatland cores dated by Pb-210 analysis in the Greater Khingan Range and Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China to determine their carbon accumulation rates and evaluate possible climate connections during the last 100years. The carbon accumulation rate and temperature in the Greater Khingan Range were lower than that in the Sanjiang Plain. Carbon accumulation rate in the last 100years was higher than the long-term rate of carbon accumulation in the last two millennia mainly due to the addition of peat was more obvious than the decomposition on the background of warming. Regression relationships between temperature and Non-autogenic carbon accumulation rate were constructed by GAMs, GBMs, and RF models. We also predicted the trend of carbon accumulation rate in Northeast China over the next century based on these models. The future carbon accumulation rates in the Great Khingan Range under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 will increase until around 2100 CE in the face of warming. Future peatland carbon accumulation rate under a warmer climate show a decrease in the Sanjiang Plain under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5.

   ENVIRONMENT
AB As one of the most important source rocks and reservoirs of unconventional natural gas, the sedimentary environment and mode of peat swamp (the predecessor of coal seam) is important to the coal seam's spatial distribution, material composition, hydrocarbon generation potential, reservoir physical properties, etc. To reveal the depositional characteristics and history of environmental change in a terrestrial basin during a period of peat accumulation, the Middle Jurassic aged #7 coal from Gaoquan in the Qaidam Basin (NW China) was investigated using sedimentology, maceral composition, geochemistry and sequence stratigraphy. Based on identification of the sedimentary shoreline break belt, wave energy depletion point and position of wave base, the peat swamp system can be subdivided into (1) lakeside plain, (2) low energy lakeshore, (3) high energy lakeshore, and (4) shallow lake subfacies. A new method for determining coal facies is proposed based on the combination of environmental parameters including oxidation-reduction levels, energy conditions and the influence of terrigneous sediments. The evolution of the coal seam shows that peat was deposited mainly in the low energy lakeshore and lakeside plain subfacies. Five types of sequence stratigrpahic surface and two types of parasequence were identified. Forced lake regressions and normal lake regressions are attributed as the causes of sequence boundaries. The sequence stratigraphic framework comprises six sequences and corresponding system tracts, and the curve of base-level for each demonstrates a characteristic initial period of slow rising followed by fast rising and then returning to slow rising. A model indicating the relationship among base-level changes, coal facies evolution, and the environmental features in the swamp is proposed that shows the environmental features of the swamp were controlled by both base-level changes and coal facies. Accompanying depositional environment changes from a lakeside plain to lakeshore and shallow lake caused by increasing rate of base-level rise, water paleosalinity, acidity and the percentage of woody plants decrease, and the bog type alters from the low marsh to raised bog.

AB Fire is known to impact soil properties and hydrological flow paths. However, the impact of prescribed vegetation burning on blanket peatland hydrology is poorly understood. We studied 10 blanket peat headwater catchments. Five were subject to prescribed burning, while five were unburnt controls. Within the burnt catchments, we studied plots where the last burn occurred similar to 2 (B2), 4 (B4), 7 (B7), or greater than 10 years (B10+) prior to the start of measurements. These were compared with plots at similar topographic wetness index locations in the control catchments. Plots subject to prescribed vegetation burning had significantly deeper water tables (difference in means=5.3 cm) and greater water table variability than unburnt plots. Water table depths were significantly different between burn age classes (B2> B4> B7> B10+) while B10+ water tables were not significantly different to the unburnt controls. Overland flow was less common on burnt peat than on unburnt peat, recorded in 9% and 17% of all runoff trap visits, respectively. Storm lag times and hydrograph recession limb periods were significantly greater (by similar to 1 and 13 h on average, respectively) in the burnt catchments overall, but for the largest 20% of storms sampled, there was no significant difference in storm lag times between burnt and unburnt catchments. For the largest 20% of storms, the hydrograph intensity of burnt catchments was significantly greater than those of unburnt catchments (means of 4.2 x 10(-5) and 3.4 x 10(-5) s(-1), respectively), thereby indicating a nonlinear streamflow response to prescribed burning. Together, these results from plots to whole river catchments indicate that prescribed vegetation burning has important effects on blanket peatland hydrology at a range of spatial scales.

AB Surface water, pore water, vegetation and peat cores were sampled from a waterlogged ombrotrophic peat bog on the Shetland Isles, UK and analysed for different S forms and their isotopic composition, in an attempt to elucidate the biogeochemical processes affecting S during peat diagenesis. Surface waters show that inputs of S to the peat have a maritime-dominated isotopic composition close to +20 parts per thousand(CDT). Uptake of S by vegetation introduces a -10 parts per thousand. shift in delta S-34 from these input values.
   Below the vegetation layer and down to 18 cm depth, bacterial SO42- reduction is the major control on S species distribution and isotopic composition within the solid peat and pore waters. In this part of the peat, preferential reduction of (SO4)-S-32 in pore water during metabolism produces isotopically light sulphide, which is incorporated into the solid phase in both inorganic and organic forms, while pore water SO42- becomes enriched in 34S. From 18 to 28 cm, organic 4 S content falls relative to C and residual organic S becomes 34 S-enriched, indicative of mineralization of organic S, a process which releases isotopically light S to the pore waters. Still deeper in the core (28 to similar to 50 cm), bacterial reduction of pore-water SO42- S-34, now enriched in, results in addition of isotopically heavy S to the solid phase. Limited pore water data suggest that below 50 cm mineralization reactions again release S from the organic fraction of the peat. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in the hydrological conditions of coastal wetlands may potentially affect the role of wetlands in the methane (CH4) cycle. In this study, the CH4 production potential and emissions from restored coastal reed wetlands at different water levels were examined in eastern China at a field scale in two phenological seasons. Results showed that the total CH4 flux from reeds at various water levels were positive, indicating that they were "sources" of CH4. During the peak growing season, CH4 flux from reeds was greater than that during the spring thaw. CH4 flux from reeds in inundated conditions was greater than that in non-inundated conditions. The CH4 production potential during the peak growing season was far greater than that during the spring thaw. However, the effect of water level on wetland CH4 production potential differed among seasons. The correlations among CH4 production potential, soil properties and CH4 flux change at different water level. These results demonstrate that water level was related to CH4 production and CH4 flux. The growing season also plays a role in CH4 fluxes. Controlling the hydrological environment in restored wetlands has important implications for the maintenance of their function as carbon sinks.

AB Loss of organic matter from cultivated peat soils is a threat to farmers, due to the surface subsidence associated with organic matter loss, and to the atmosphere, due to CO2 and N2O emissions from the soil. In a three-year field experiment (2015-2017) on a drained, cultivated fen peat in southern Sweden, we tested whether reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) perform better on peat soils than the commonly grown timothy grass (Phleurn pratense L.), without increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In the experiment, we compared yield, nutrient uptake, penetration resistance and loss of organic matter measured as greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O and CH4). Yield of timothy was significantly lower than that of reed canary grass and tall fescue in 2016, and lower than that of reed canary grass in 2017. Yield level increased over time, with total dry matter yield in 2017 of 11.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for timothy, 13.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for tall fescue and 14.3 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for reed canary grass. Total removal of all macronutrients in 2016 was higher in reed canary grass and tall fescue than in timothy. For nitrogen (N), reed canary grass removed a total of 173 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), tall fescue 169 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and timothy 121 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), while the fertilisation rate was only 50 kg N ha(-1). There were no differences in trafficability, measured as penetration resistance. Measurements of greenhouse gas emissions in the snow-free season in 2016 and 2017 using manual dark chambers (CO2, N2O and CH4) and in 2016 automatic dark chambers (CO2) revealed only small differences in CO2 emissions between the treatments. The N2O emissions were also low and CH4 emissions were very low and in general negative. The estimated carbon capture efficiency (ratio of C in aboveground biomass plus roots to emitted CO2-C measured by the automatic chambers) for the growing season (May-October) in 2016 was lowest for timothy (0.61) and higher for reed canary grass and tall fescue (0.70 and 0.70, respectively). Reed canary grass and tall fescue are thus promising alternatives to timothy on peat soils regarding yield, nutrient removal and carbon capture efficiency.

AB There is little information published on the distribution of Sphagnum moss in South Australia. Data on the known distribution of Sphagnum moss were compiled from South Australian Herbarium records, previous publications and information from field officers. A list of sites where Sphagnum moss was known to occur or might occur was prepared and as many of these sites were surveyed as possible during October 2006. Sphagnum was found not to form Sphagnum peatlands, as it does in other parts of eastern Australia and overseas, but tends to occur as a minor component in other peatland and/or heath vegetation communities. Sphagnum was most commonly found in conjunction with Melaleuca/Leptospermum heaths or Restionaceous sedge communities.
   Many of the sites surveyed showed signs of drying, including the desiccation of Sphagnum moss, the germination of Acacia melanoxylon seedlings and the presence of several weed species. 'Big Swamp' described as a Sphagnum peatland in 1939 (Crocker & Eardley) was found to contain only two minute patches of drying Sphagnum novo-zelandicum. Many sites were surrounded by weeds, with the hydrology of many catchments with Sphagnum moss affected by eucalypt and/or pine plantations. The small populations of Sphagnum novo-zelandicum and the threats posed by lower moisture availability indicate that this species should be listed as threatened in South Australia.

DT Article
AB Studying the soil mantle pattern and profile composition for different soils of the Khallerchinskaya Tundra (extreme northeast of Siberia) enabled the development of a concept of a unique evolutionary process for this territory related to the overgrowing and transformation of polygonal bogs. A suggestion was made as to the autochthonous succession and the theoretical possibility for the autodrainage of excessively wet tundra. Evolutionary dynamics was illustrated by a number of crucial physical and chemical properties, as well as by direct and circumstantial parameters of the peat accumulation rate, transformation of organogenic horizons, methanogenesis, denitrification, Al-Fe-humus process, etc. A chart of changes in the soil profile was given for different stages of a polygon development.

AB The potential for methane oxidation was measured, and methanotroph gene sequences studied, in a peat core from the Moorhouse Nature Reserve, UK. Methane oxidation potential was observed in all depths of the peat core (down to 30 cm), and was inhibited by addition of acetylene, indicating the involvement of methane-oxidising bacteria. A peak of activity was shown in the 10-12 cm horizon, below which activity decreased with depth. Above this horizon, methane oxidation was relatively high and showed little change with depth. 16S rDNA libraries from several sections of the peat core were screened with methanotroph 16S rDNA probes designed to detect the genera Methylomonas, Methylococcus Methylobacter and Methylosinus. Two clones, MHP14 and MHP17, hybridised strongly with the Methylosinus probe and upon complete sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were shown to group closely to the Methylosinus/Methylocystis genera of methanotrophs. However, the clones do form a distinct branch of their own, supported by BOOTSTRAP values, and may represent a novel group of acidophilic methanotrophs which have yet to be cultured.

AB The high-arctic environment is an environment where the consequences of global warming may be significant. In this paper we report on findings on carbon dioxide and water vapour fluxes above a sedge-dominated fen at Zackenberg (74 degrees 28'N, 20 degrees 34' W) in The National Park of North and East Greenland. Eddy covariance measurements were initiated at the start of the growing season and terminated shortly before its end lasting 45 days. The net CO2 nux during daytime reaches a high of 10 mu mol m(-2)s(-1), and around the summer solstice, net CO2 assimilation occurred at midnight, resulting in net carbon gain during the night. The measured carbon dioxide fluxes compare well to estimates based on the photosynthesis model by Collatz et al. (1991). The total growing-season net ecosystem CO2 exchange was estimated to be 96 g cm(-2) based on the carbon dioxide model and micrometeorological data. Finally, the combined CO2 assimilation and soil respiration models are used for examining the dependence of the carbon dioxide budget on temperature. The ecosystem is found to function optimally given the present temperature conditions whereas either an increase or a decrease in temperature would reduce the ecosystem CO2 accumulation. An increase in temperature by 5 degrees C would turn the ecosystem into a carbon dioxide source.

AB Peat in the discontinuous permafrost zone contains a globally significant reservoir of carbon that has undergone multiple permafrost-thaw cycles since the end of the mid-Holocene (similar to 3700 years before present). Periods of thaw increase C decomposition rates which leads to the release of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere creating potential climate feedback. To determine the magnitude and direction of such feedback, we measured CO2 and CH4 emissions and modeled C accumulation rates and radiative fluxes from measurements of two radioactive tracers with differing lifetimes to describe the C balance of the peatland over multiple permafrost-thaw cycles since the initiation of permafrost at the site. At thaw features, the balance between increased primary production and higher CH4 emission stimulated by warmer temperatures and wetter conditions favors C sequestration and enhanced peat accumulation. Flux measurements suggest that frozen plateaus may intermittently (order of years to decades) act as CO2 sources depending on temperature and net ecosystem respiration rates, but modeling results suggest that-despite brief periods of net C loss to the atmosphere at the initiation of thaw-integrated over millennia, these sites have acted as net C sinks via peat accumulation. In greenhouse gas terms, the transition from frozen permafrost to thawed wetland is accompanied by increasing CO2 uptake that is partially offset by increasing CH4 emissions. In the short-term (decadal time scale) the net effect of this transition is likely enhanced warming via increased radiative C emissions, while in the long-term (centuries) net C deposition provides a negative feedback to climate warming.

AB The last one hundred years of land use history in the southern part of Valdai Hills (European Russia) were reconstructed on the base of high resolution pollen data from the peat monolith taken from the Central Forest State Reserve supplementing with historical records derived from maps of the General Land Survey of the 18th and 19th centuries and satellite images. According to the created age model provided by dating using radio-nuclides Pb-210 and Cs-137, pollen data of the peat monolith allow us to reconstruct vegetation dynamics during the last one hundred years with high time resolution. The obtained data showed that, despite the location of the studied peatland in the center of the forest area and rather far away from possible croplands and hayfields, the pollen values of plants-anthropogenic indicators (Secale sereale, Centaurea cyanus, Plantago, Rumex, etc.) and micro-charcoal concentration are relatively high in the period since the beginning of the 20th century to the 1970s, especially in the peat horizon formed in the 1950s. In the late 1970s-the early 1980s when the pollen values of cereals gradually diminished in assemblages, the quantity of pollen of other anthropogenic indicators were also significantly reduced, which reflects the overall processes of the agriculture decline in the forest zone of the former USSR.

AB Vegetation plays a critical role in regulating ecosystem carbon (C) processes in peatlands, but vegetation faces serious degradation on the Tibetan Plateau, China. However, how vegetation degradation affects on carbon processes of peatlands remains unclear. Using the static chamber technique, we compared ecosystem respiration (Re) and methane (CH4) fluxes for healthy vegetation (HV) and degraded vegetation (DV) during two growing seasons (2013 and 2014) on peatlands of the Tibetan Plateau. We also determined the dominant factors controlling Re and CH4 fluxes. The average Re flux for DV (218.04 +/- 95.08 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2013 and 219.03 +/- 140.96 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2014) was considerably larger than that at the HV(163.78 +/- 87.51 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2013 and 143.91 +/- 84.44 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2014), whereas the average CH4 fluxes for DV (0.06 +/- 0.20 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2013 and 0.04 +/- 0.07 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2014) were significantly lower than the corresponding fluxes for HV (2.19 +/- 2.05 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2013 and 0.85 +/- 0.95 mg C m(-2)h(-1) in 2014). The Re fluxes for the two vegetative treatments had the same temporal trends, with the peaking flux observed in July 2014. The temporal patterns of CH4 fluxes were similar to Re for two vegetation treatments where fluxes peaked in July 2014. Soil temperatures were found to be the primary factors influencing temporal Re fluxes. Soil temperatures and soil water content (SWC) were found to be the dominant factors influencing temporal CH4 flux for HV, while the main control for CH4 emission was the SWC for DV. Therefore, vegetative condition must be considered when estimating Re and CH4 flux from peatlands, particularly under the current situation of climate warming.

AB The recent expansion of Phragmites australis (common reed) from the marsh-upland interface into high marsh zones provides an opportunity to assess the impact of individual plant species on biomass production and decomposition in salt marshes. Seasonal harvests of aboveground and belowground biomass demonstrate that annual production of P. australis is approximately three times greater for aboveground biomass, two times greater for belowground biomass, and 30% lower in root: shoot ratio than neighboring populations of S. patens. Whole-plant litter (stems and leaves) also decomposes at a much slower annual rate for P. australis (k = 0.25) than S patens litter (k = 0.57). By crossing litter type with site of litter decomposition, I found these plant species to influence decay rates through litter type and not through their effects on marsh surface conditions (e.g., temperature, sedimentation rates). Based on these calculations, annual rates of carbon accumulation in the peat of high marshes are likely to increase 5-fold once P. australis becomes established due to its greater rates of biomass production and residence time in infrequently flooded brackish marshes.

TI MODES OF OCCURRENCE OF RARE EARTH ELEMENTS IN PEATS OF WEST SIBERIA

AB The relevance of the study is determined by the necessity to distinguish the origin and to develop the models for accumulation of rare earth elements in peats and coals for forecasting and detecting rare metal mineralization in coalfields. The relevance is caused as well by the necessity of obtaining comprehensive information owing to peat integrated use in agricultural industry.
   The aim of the research is to study the modes of occurrence and to assess the balance of rare earth elements modes of occurrence in peats of Western Siberia; to estimate the role of organic and mineral matter in accumulation of rare earth elements in high-bog and low moor peats, and on this ground to define the nature of lanthanides accumulation in peats.
   Research methods: peat division into group components by the lnstorf method: bitums, water-soluble and hydrolyzable substances, humic and fulvic acids, non-hydrolyzable residue; investigation of rare earth elements content using neutron-activation analysis; REE balance calculation for fractions of group composition; scanning electronic microscopy using a Hitachi S-3400N microscope with energy dispersive spectrometer Bruker XFlash 4010 for studying mineral forms.
   Results. The authors have singled out and studied the group components of peats. It was ascertained that the main mass of the REE in peats is related to the fraction hydrolyzable and water-soluble substances and organic matter. From 40 till 80 % of total content of REE in peat is accounted for the fraction of hydrolyzable and water-soluble substances. 10-30 % of the amount of REE is concentrated in humic acids. Mineral matter in peats plays a minor role in accumulation of lanthanides. In general, not more than 25 % is accounted for mineral substance in the rare earth elements balance in peats. Among the mineral forms of REE in peats phosphates (monazite, xenotime, crandallite) and zircon are dominated. The division of lanthanides in fractions of group compound of peat is noticed. The fraction of water-soluble and hydrolyzable substances is relatively enriched with light rare earths, and humic substances are enriched with heavy rare earths.

AB Subsurface flow through peat plays a critical role in the hydrology of organic-covered, permafrost terrains, which occupy a large part the continental arctic, sub-arctic, and boreal regions. Hillslope drainage in these terrains occurs predominantly through the active flow zone between the relatively impermeable frost table and the water table above it. The hydraulic conductivity profile within this zone controls the subsurface drainage of snowmelt and storm water. Peat hydraulic conductivity profiles were examined at three sites in north-western Canada, each representing a widely occurring organic-covered, permafrost terrain type. Three independent measures of saturated hydraulic conductivity were used-tracer tests, constant-head wellpermeameter tests, and laboratory measurements of undisturbed samples. At all three sites, the conductivity profiles contained very high values (10- 1000 m d(-1)) within the top ca 0. 1 m where the peat is only lightly decomposed, a large reduction with increasing depth below the ground surface in the transition zone, and relatively low values in a narrow range (0-5-5 m d(-1)) below ca 0.2 m depth, where the peat is in an advanced state of decomposition. Digital image analysis of resin-impregnated peat samples showed that hydraulic conductivity is essentially controlled by pore hydraulic radius. The strong dependence of hydraulic conductivity on hydraulic radius implies that peat soils subjected to similar degrees of decomposition and compaction have a similar hydraulic conductivity regardless of the location. This explains the similarity of the depth-conductivity profiles among all three terrain types. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The effect of prescribed burning for conservation management of plant communities is controversial for moorlands growing on peat. These ecosystems provide many services that may be damaged by fire, hence it is important to fully assess its impact on all aspects of ecosystem structure and function experimentally over relatively long time-scales. This paper describes change in community composition, major plant species, and plant functional types on moorland on peat in upland Britain over 60years subject to 3 burning treatments after an initial burn in 1954/1955: no further burn and burning at 10- and 20-year intervals (all +/- sheep grazing). Data were analysed using multivariate and univariate methods. Vegetation composition and individual species abundance reflected the degree of disturbance. The least disturbed was dominated by Calluna vulgaris and pleurocarpous mosses, whereas the most disturbed treatment (burned every 10years) had greater Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum spp., acrocarpous mosses, liverworts, and lichens. The 20-year treatment was intermediate in response disturbance. Repeated burning increased species abundance-weighted Ellenberg values for moisture, reaction, light through time, and fertility; the exception was the 10-year rotation for fertility. These confirm that prescribed burning is not deleterious to peat-forming species (Eriophorum spp. and Sphagnum spp.), indeed these species were found in greater abundance in frequently burned treatments. It also confirms that a no-burn policy will lead to increasing dominance ofC.vulgaris, a flammable, fire-adapted shrub, which increases summer wildfire risk. These results inform conservation management policy for moorland vegetation growing on peat; for this site, a 20-year prescribed burning rotation is recommended.

AB Catchment-scale transit times for water are increasingly being recognized as an important control on geochemical processes. In this study, snowmelt water mean transit times (MTTs) were estimated for the 15 Krycklan research catchments in northern boreal Sweden. The snowmelt water MTTs were assumed to be representative of the catchment-scale hydrologic response during the spring thaw period and, as such, may be considered to be a component of the catchment's overall MTT. These snowmelt water MTTs were empirically related to catchment characteristics and landscape structure represented by using different indices of soil cover, topography and catchment similarity. Mire wetlands were shown to be significantly correlated to snowmelt MTTs for the studied catchments. In these wetlands, shallow ice layers form that have been shown to serve as impervious boundaries to vertical infiltration during snowmelt periods and, thus, alter the flow pathways of water in the landscape. Using a simple thought experiment, we could estimate the potential effect of thawing of ice layers on snowmelt hydrologic response using the empirical relationship between landscape structure (represented using a catchment-scale Pe number) and hydrologic response. The result of this thought experiment was that there could be a potential increase of 20-45% in catchment snowmelt water MTTs for the Krycklan experimental catchments. It is therefore possible that climatic changes present competing influences on the hydrologic response of northern boreal catchments that need to be considered. For example, MTTs may tend to decrease during some times of the year due to an acceleration in the hydrologic cycle, while they tend to increase MTTs during other times of the year due to shifts in hydrologic flow pathways. The balance between the competing influences on a catchment's MTT has consequences on climatic feedbacks as it could influence hydrological and biogeochemical cycles at the catchment scale for northern latitude boreal catchments.

AB Coal seams preserve continuous and high-resolution records of paleoenvironments and wildfire events during peat accumulation. In order to elucidate wildfire characteristics and terrestrial climate changes during the time of peat accumulation, petrographic characteristics of coals in the Lower Cretaceous Yimin Formation (Albian) in the Jiuqiao Sag, Hailar Basin, NE China were studied. Coal petrology analysis shows that the studied coal seams are characterized by dominant huminite (average 80.0 vol.%, mmfmineral matter free), secondary inertinite (average 19.9 vol.%, mmf), and a very low mineral content (average 0.8 vol.%). These results suggest that the coal developed under waterlogged conditions in raised, ombrotrophic mires. The occurrence of moderate inertinite values in the coals implies that wildfires were frequent during the Albian. Burning temperature, ranging from 273 to 379 degrees C inferred from inertinite reflectances, indicates that wildfires during the Albian were ground fires because of low plant heights. Vertical trends in inertinite and huminite compositional changes within the coal seams may reflect localscale, cyclic fluctuations in wildfire occurrence during the development of the peat mires. The likely cause of these fluctuations was changes in temperature and rainfall. The presence of significant levels of inertinite in the coals and inferred high atmospheric oxygen levels suggest that the Albian was a highly fire-prone period in the Hailar Basin. The recurrent occurrences of palaeo-wildfires events in the studied succession in the Hailar Basin reinforce that fire was an important element affecting wetland biodiversity during the Albian, while diversification and spread of angiosperms was taking place globally. Increased surface runoff and erosion after the palaeo-wildfires in the Jiuqiao Sag during the Albian may have enhanced the flux and availability of nutrients and sediments washing into the fluvial, lacustrine, and marine systems, further contributing to the Albian dysoxic-anoxic events.

AB Wonderkrater is a spring mound consisting entirely of peat in excess of 8 m thick. It has yielded a pollen record extending back over 35,000 years, which has provided one of the very few proxy climatic records for the interior of southern Africa in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The current investigation of the morphology and sedimentology of the site has revealed that the peat mound formed due to artesian conditions at the spring, but that accumulation of the thick peat succession was made possible because of clastic sedimentation on the surrounding piedmont which in turn was brought about by aggradation on the adjacent Nyl River floodplain. The peat mound has remained elevated relative to the surrounding piedmont for most of the 35,000 year period. Aggradation of the mound was slower during the Late Pleistocene than the Holocene (0.06-0.1 m/1000 year and 0.2-0.38 m/1000 year, respectively). Controlled archaeological excavations yielded a diverse late Pleistocene fauna preserved in peat and sand in the mound. A 1 m thick, coarse sand horizon at the base of the peat deposit contained a rich Middle Stone Age (>30 k year) lithic assemblage. The MSA sand layer likely represents an arid phase, suggesting the site's antiquity as a place of refuge for Quaternary animals and the people that hunted them. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sites in the West Siberian peat bog 'Bakchar' were acidic (pH 4.2-4.8), low in nutrients, and emitted CH4 at rates of 0.2-1.5 mmol m(-2) h(-1). The vertical profile of delta(13)CH(4) and delta(13)CO(2) dissolved in the porewater indicated increasing isotope fractionation and thus increasing contribution of H-2/CO2-dependent methanogenesis with depth. The anaerobic microbial community at 30-50 cm below the water table produced CH4 with optimum activity at 20-25degreesC and pH 5.0-5.5 respectively. Inhibition of methanogenesis with 2-bromo-ethane sulphonate showed that acetate, phenyl acetate, phenyl propionate and caproate were important intermediates in the degradation pathway of organic matter to CH4. Further degradation of these intermediates indicated that 62-72% of the CH4 was ultimately derived from acetate, the remainder from H-2/CO2. Turnover times of [2-C-14]acetate were on the order of 2 days (15, 25degreesC) and accounted for 60-65% of total CH4 production. Conversion of (CO2)-C-14 to (CH4)-C-14 accounted for 35-43% of total CH4 production. These results showed that acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis operated closely at a ratio of approximately 2 : 1 irrespective of the incubation temperature (4, 15 and 25degreesC). The composition of the archaeal community was determined in the peat samples by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and sequencing of amplified SSU rRNA gene fragments, and showed that members of Methanomicrobiaceae, Methanosarcinaceae and Rice cluster II (RC-II) were present. Other, presumably non-methanogenic archaeal clusters (group III, RC-IV, RC-V, RC-VI) were also detected. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that the number of Bacteria decreased (from 24 x 10(7) to 4 x 10(7) cells per gram peat) with depth (from 5 to 55 cm below the water table), whereas the numbers of Archaea slightly increased (from 1 x 10(7) to 2 x 10(7) cells per gram peat). Methanosarcina spp. accounted for about half of the archaeal cells. Our results show that both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis are an integral part of the CH4-producing pathway in acidic peat and were represented by appropriate methanogenic populations.

AB Neogene terrestrial deposits of sand and gravel with preserved wood and peat accumulations occur in many areas of the High Arctic. The Pliocene-aged Beaver Pond fossil site (Ellesmere Island, NU) is one such site that differs from other sites in the great thickness of its peat layer and the presence of a rich vertebrate faunal assemblage, along with numerous beaver-cut sticks. Although the site has been the subject of intense paleontological investigations for over two decades, there has not been a reconstruction of its depositional history. In this study, measured sections within and surrounding the site established the stratigraphy and lateral continuity of the stratigraphic units. Grain size analysis, loss on ignition, and fossil diatom assemblages were examined to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes in the sequence. The base of the section was interpreted as a floodplain system. Using modern peat accumulation rates, the maximum thickness (240 cm) of the overlying peat layer is estimated to represent 49000 +/- 12000 years. From this evidence, we suggest that during the peat formation interval, beaver activity may have played a role in creating an open water environment. The peat unit was overlain by sand, rich in organic matter and charcoal, suggesting environmental change and fire occurrence.

TI Strong correlation between summer temperature and pollen accumulation

ID FOSSIL POLLEN; DEPOSITION; FINLAND; MODELS
AB Highly resolved pollen spectra analysed from a 47 cm peat monolith recovered from a mire in northern Sweden exhibit climatic sensitivity in the pollen accumulation rates (PAR) of boreal treeline species. Robust temporal control, afforded through multiple AMS radiocarbon dating of the post-atomic-bomb-test period (AD 1961-2002), provides a unique opportunity to compare pollen accumulation rates with the instrumental meteorological record. Strong correlations are observed between summer temperature and PAR for Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Betula spp. (excluding B. nana). Despite well constrained, contiguous ('annual') sampling, the ternporal resolution of the pollen signal preserved within each sample appears to be degraded to ca. 3-5 year resolution. This is likely to reflect processes occurring during peat accumulation and pollen deposition, as well as dating uncertainties and the effects of subsampling. These findings identify limitations to the maximum resolution that may realistically be recovered from the peat archive using high-resolution sampling protocols and AMS C-14 dating. We also identify the need for additional work to quantify the role of climate on peat accumulation and the resultant impact on assemblage-based palaeoenvironmental reconstructions within mire sequences. The strongest climate association observed for Picea abies (r(adjusted)(2) = 0.53; n = 36) was extended through the monolith beyond the 42 year period of 'annual' sampling and the response successfully correlated with the Bottenviken historical instrumental record to AD 1860. Although only presenting data from a single site, and requiring wider replication, we conclude that for sites close to the ecological limits of tree species, where levels of anthropogenic/non-climatic forcing on pollen production are low, well-dated records of PAR may potentially provide a proxy for reconstructing past summer temperature variability.

AB Peatlands are wetlands that provide important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and water storage that respond to hydrological, biological, and biogeochemical processes. These processes are strongly influenced by the complex pore structure of peat soils. We explore the literature on peat pore structure and the implications for hydrological, biogeochemical, and microbial processes in peat, highlighting the gaps in our current knowledge and a path to move forward. Peat is an elastic and multi-porous structured organic soil. Surficial (near-surface) pears are typically dominated by large interconnected macropores that rapidly transmit water and solutes when saturated, but these large pores drain rapidly with a reduction in pore-water pressure, and disproportionally decrease the bulk effective hydraulic conductivity, thus water fluxes that drive ecohydrological functions. The more advanced state of decomposition of older (deeper) peat, with a greater abundance of small pores, restricts the loss of moisture at similar soil water pressures and is associated with higher unsaturated hydraulic conductivities. As evaporation and precipitation occur, peat soils shrink and swell, respectively, changing the hydrological connectivity that maintain physiological processes at the peat surface. Due to the disproportionate change in pore structure and associated hydraulic properties with state of decomposition, transport processes are limited at depth, creating a zone of enhanced transport in the less decomposed peat near the surface. At the micro-scale, rapid equilibration of solutes and water occurs between the mobile and immobile pores due to diffusion, resulting in pore regions with similar chemical concentrations that are not affected by advective fluxes. These immobile regions may be the primary sites for microbial biogeochemical processes in peat. Mass transfer limitations may therefore largely regulate belowground microbial turnover and, hence, biogeochemical cycling. For peat, the development of a comprehensive theory that links the hydrological, biological, and biogeochemical processes will require a concerted interdisciplinary effort. To that end, we have highlighted four primary areas to focus our collective research: 1) understanding the combined and interrelated effects of parent material, decomposition, and nutrient status on peat pore connectivity, macropore development and collapse, and solute transport, 2) determining the influence of changing pore structure due to freeze-thaw or dewatering on the hydrology and biogeochemistry, 3) better elucidating the non-equilibrium transport processes in peat, and 4) exploring the implications of peat's pore structure on microbiological and biogeochemical processes.

ID CARBON
AB Water table position, through the creation of aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the soil profile, plays an important role in controlling CH4 flux from wetlands. A laboratory study of peat columns revealed that CH4 emission rates initially increased and then decreased as the water table was lowered from the peat surface to a depth of 50 cm, with the release of CH4 trapped in pores.  There was a strong hysteresis between CH4 flux on the falling and rising water table limbs (falling > rising). When expressed as seasonal average values, there was a strong relationship (r2 0.08 - 0.74) between log CH4 flux and water table position for sites within 5 wetland regions in boreal-subarctic Canada. The regression coefficients were similar among regions (0.022 - 0.037), but there were differences in the regression constants (0.47 - 1.89). CH4 flux from drained, forested peatland soils decreased as the water table depth increased, and several sites were transformed from sources to sinks of CH4. Global CH4 emissions to the atmosphere may have been reduced by almost-equal-to 1 Tg yr-1 by peatland drainage during the last 100 yr.

AB Cloudberry has good economic potential for Canada, but crop practices must be improved before commercial production can be established. Transplants usually consist of rhizome segments collected in natural populations; however, the very low root density of these transplants might partly explain their initial slow growth and high mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of mineral fertilization and auxin applications on root initiation and elongation. Three N-P-K fertilization treatments were applied at the planting of bare rhizomes in peatlands, while auxin applications were tested in both greenhouse and field experiments. Roots of fertilized plants were two to four times longer and more numerous than those of control plants after one complete growing season but fertilization did not lead to early rooting. Rhizome segments produced new shoots before investing in root production, suggesting that rhizome carbohydrate reserves are not sufficient to allow both the shoot and root to be produced at the same time. Auxin applications to the rhizomes incurred high mortality and did not stimulate root production in both the field and greenhouse experiments. We conclude that fertilizers applied at planting can improve cloudberry initial survival rate, rooting, and early shoot growth, which could eventually lead to improved plant cover and fruit yield.

AB Recent concerns over the environmental impact of peat harvesting have led to restrictions on the production of peat based potting substrates. Therefore the objective of our study was to evaluate the use of compost and biogas residues without and each with 20% additives (Perlite, Styromull, Hygromull, Lecaton, Peat, Cocofiber) as a substitute for peat. Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), chosen as an experimental plant, was cut four times. The results reveal that compost and biogas residues are suitable potting substrates. The incorporation of additives mixed into the basic materials partly resulted in higher yield and nutrient uptake. However, the difference among additives was mainly insignificant. Incorporation of Hygromull, especially into biogas residues favored plant growth and increased the uptake of nutrients, which is attributed to the fact that Hygromull stores nutrients and delivers them even later in the growing season. Furthermore Hygromull reduces the salt concentration of the medium, resulting in favored plant growth of younger plants.

To understand the effects of wind farm development on peatlands, we monitored streamwater at Europe's second largest onshore wind farm (539 MW), Whitelee, Scotland, for 31 months. Using nested catchment sampling to understand impacts on water quality, increasing macronutrient concentrations and exports were associated with wind farm development, particularly forest-felling and borrow pits. Low/poor water quality occurred in small headwater catchments most disturbed by development. At the site exit, dissolved organic C and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations increased during construction, though [SRP] recovery occurred within 2 years. Since C was lost and streamwater quality negatively affected, we propose future good practice measures for wind farm development, including limiting total disturbance within individual catchments and locating borrow pits, where deemed necessary, off site avoiding peatlands.

AB We developed and tested a new method to separate CO(2) and CH(4) from bulk gas samples for radiocarbon and stable-carbon analysis that utilizes a zeolite molecular sieve. To validate the technique, tests were performed using a suite of standard gases, composed of CO(2) and CH(4) of distinctly different isotopic composition. We employed the method to investigate the carbon isotopic composition of samples of dissolved CO(2) and CH(4) collected in situ from the near surface to deep layers of an ombrotrophic raised peat bog. Results showed that the age of both the CO(2) and CH(4) components of the dissolved gases increased with depth from similar to 0-300 BP at 0.25 m to similar to 4000 BP at 4 m. CH(4) was mainly similar or slightly older in age compared to CO(2), with the greatest difference in ages occurring at 1 m depth where CH(4) was older by 430-615 yr. The delta(13)C values of CO(2) increased with depth from -12.4 parts per thousand and -8.0 parts per thousand at 0.25 m to + 6.9 parts per thousand and + 8.3 parts per thousand at 4 m, whereas the delta(13)C of CH(4) stayed in the range -58.4 parts per thousand to -70.6 parts per thousand. The (14)C results from the deepest layers are consistent with a similar source for both gases. (14)C ages for the CO(2) component were younger compared to CH(4), within the shallower depths of the peat bog (<= 1 m) and demonstrate the incorporation of acrotelm-derived respired CO(2) into the catotelm.

AB The Eastern Kentucky Coal Field is located in the central portion of the Appalachian Basin. The Pennsylvanian Breathitt Formation in this region is characterized by numerous sequences of bituminous coal-bearing sedimentary rocks. These coals have distinct maceral compositions due to variations in depositional environments. Coal characterization is an important method for determining conditions that influenced peat accumulation and overall depositional settings of mires. This study focuses on the characterization of the maceral composition of the Middle Pennsylvanian-age Leatherwood coal bed. It utilizes petrographical, palynological, and geochemical analyses to describe specific depositional environments and associated peat accumulation conditions. Petrographic analyses indicate that these coals have relatively high liptinite and varying inertinite content, along with trace amounts of mineral matter. Vitrinite, mainly in the form of collotelinite, is the most dominant maceral group. Geochemical data reveals low ash and sulfur content. Ancillary palynological data shows the palynomorph assemblage to be dominated by tree fern and large Lycopod tree spores, with lesser amounts of small Lycopod tree, small fern, and Cordaites and Calamites spores. The petrographic, geochemical and palynological data indicate that both domed, ombrotrophic, and planar, rheotrophic mire conditions, with limited local detrital influx, contributed to the formation of the Leatherwood coal.

AB The largest terrestrial-to-atmosphere carbon flux is respired CO2. However, the partitioning of soil and plant sources, understanding of contributory mechanisms, and their response to climate change are uncertain. A plant removal experiment was established within a peatland located in the UK uplands to quantify respiration derived from recently-fixed plant carbon and that derived from decomposition of soil organic matter, using natural abundance C-13 and bomb-C-14 as tracers. Soil and plant respiration sources were found respectively to contribute similar to 36% and between 41 and 54% of the total ecosystem CO2 flux. Respired CO2 produced in the clipped ('soil') plots had a mean age of similar to 15 years since fixation from the atmosphere, whereas the C-14 content of ecosystem CO2 was statistically indistinguishable from the contemporary atmosphere. Results of carbon mass balance modelling showed that, in addition to respiration from bulk soil and plant respired CO2, a third, much older source of CO2 existed. This source, which we suggest is CO2 derived from the catotelm constituted between similar to 10 and 23% of total ecosystem respiration and had a mean radiocarbon age of between several hundred and similar to 2000 years before present (BP). These findings show that plant-mediated transport of CO2 produced in the catotelm may form a considerable component of peatland ecosystem respiration. The implication of this discovery is that current assumptions in terrestrial carbon models need to be re-evaluated to consider the climate sensitivity of this third source of peatland CO2.

AB Analysis of the decomposition of peat has been used to identify climatic shifts over the last 10 000 years in two raised bogs, Stomyren and Kortlandamossen, south-central Sweden. Age-depth curves have been constructed using radiocarbon dates and tephra layers. Peat humification data have been subjected to spectral analyses using the Lomb-Scargle Fourier method and reveal a periodicity of c. 250 years in both records. Cycles of c. 200 yr and c 400 yr were found at Stomyren and at Kortlandamossen, respectively. These periodicities could correspond to changes in solar activity levels. A test estimating the possible level of noise has been applied to the spectral analyses. The humification indices indicate prominent shifts to wetter conditions at c. 7500, 4300-4200, 3700-3500 and 2800-2400 cal. yr BR The most distinct drier phases start at c. 4500 and 3250 cal. yr BP.

AB Inspired by the importance of Redfield-type C : N : P ratios in global soils, we looked for analogous patterns in peatlands and aimed at deciphering the potential affecting factors. By analyzing a suite of peatlands soil data (n = 1031), mean soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) contents were 50.51%, 1.45% and 0.13%, respectively, while average C : N, C : P and N : P ratios were 26.72, 1186.00 and 46.58, respectively. C : N ratios showed smaller variations across different vegetation coverage and had less spatial heterogeneity than C : P and N:P ratios. No consistent C : N : P ratio, though with a general value of 1245 : 47 : 1, was found for entire peatland soils in China. The Northeast China, Tibet, Zoig Plateau and parts of Xinjiang had high soil SOC, TN, TP, and C:P ratio. Qinghai, parts of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the coast zones have low TP and N : P ratio. Significant differences for SOC, TN, TP, C : N, C : P and N : P ratios were observed across groups categorized by predominant vegetation. Moisture, temperature and precipitation all closely related to SOC, TN, TP and their pairwise ratios. The hydrothermal coefficient (RH), defined as annual average precipitation divided by temperature, positively and significantly related to C : N, C : P and N : P ratios, implying that ongoing climate change may prejudice peatlands as carbon sinks during the past 50 years in China.

AB Peat mosses (Sphagnum) hold exceptional importance in the control of global carbon fluxes and climate because of the vast stores of carbon bound up in partially decomposed biomass (peat). This study tests the hypothesis that the early diversification of Sphagnum was in the Northern Hemisphere, with subsequent range expansions to tropical latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere. A phylogenetic analysis of 192 accessions representing the moss class Sphagnopsida based on four plastid loci was conducted in conjunction with biogeographic analyses using BioGeoBEARS to investigate the tempo and mode of geographic range evolution. Analyses support the hypothesis that the major intrageneric clades of peat-forming species accounting for >90% of peat moss diversity originated and diversified at northern latitudes. The genus underwent multiple range expansions into tropical and Southern Hemisphere regions. Range evolution in peat mosses was most common within latitudinal zones, attesting to the relative difficulty of successfully invading new climate zones. Allopolyploidy in Sphagnum (inferred from microsatellite heterozygosity) does not appear to be biased with regard to geographic region nor intrageneric clade. The inference that Sphagnum diversified in cool-or cold-climate regions and repeatedly expanded its range into tropical regions makes the genus an excellent model for studying morphological, physiological, and genomic traits associated with adaptation to warming climates.

AB This study aimed to reconstruct environmental changes in the Wkra River Valley near Bielawy Gotuskie (central Poland) based on geochemical, palynological and subfossil Cladocera analysis of deposits filling a palaeo-oxbow lake. Two sediment boreholes collected from the palaeochannel bend (BG-1) and neck (BG-2) include full sequences of organic deposits lying on clastic deposits. The lower part of the BG-1 borehole contains gyttja that accumulated during the Younger Dryas and the Preboreal, which is covered by reed peat of Preboreal and Boreal age. On top of this is alder peat that accumulated during the Atlantic. The ages of the gyttja and peat were confirmed by both radiocarbon dating and palynological analysis. The peats are characterized by a significant content of organic matter, which is relatively stable over time. This indicates a low intensity of mechanical denudation in the catchment, which is supported by low concentrations of aluminum and potassium. Calcium values greatly exceed these elements, suggesting that the lake was mainly fed by groundwater. Variation in trophic conditions over time is indicated by a vertical variability in the content of nitrogen, as well as by the Cladocera population. The strong decomposition of peat in the top layer of the mire, and increased concentrations of phosphorus and heavy metals, testify to increasing human activity during the most recent time periods.

AB Perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium) is a widespread invasive plant in North America. This yearlong field study at a pasture peatland infested with L. latifolium demonstrates that these plants are large emitters, on a per area basis, of methyl chloride (CH3Cl) and methyl bromide (CH3Br), compounds that contribute to the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Annually averaged net emission rates were 9.0 +/- 11.8 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) for CH3Cl and 460 +/- 430 nmol m(-2) d(-1) for CH3Br, comparable to observed coastal salt marsh emission rates. A stable isotope tracer technique was used to distinguish between simultaneous production and consumption processes for CH3Cl and CH3Br. Over the course of the year, gross production rates for methyl halides varied widely over different life cycle stages, with the highest fluxes surprisingly occurring at senescence. Maximum emissions of CH3Cl and CH3Br occurred at midday, the time of highest solar radiation. During the growing season, methyl halide gross production rates were positively correlated with temperature and live biomass, suggesting that the production of methyl halides from L. latifolium at this time was mostly biotic. During plant senescence, the peak emissions of CH3Cl and CH3Br are unexplained but may be released from L. latifolium associated with transitions in biochemistry. Overall, these flux measurements show expected diel and growing season trends based on plant production for most of the year, overlaid by a high emission peak during senescence, suggesting that both plant biochemical shifts and varying environmental factors need to be considered as important internal and external controls on emissions.

AB Many catchment management schemes in the UK have focussed on peatland restoration to improve ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, water quality and biodiversity. The effect of these schemes on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux is critical in understanding peatland carbon budgets as well as the implications for drinking water treatment. In many catchments, however, peatland areas arc not the only source of DOC, meaning that their significance at the full catchment scale is unclear. In this paper we have evaluated the importance of different land uses as sources of DOC by combining three damsels obtained from the Exe catchment, UK. The first dataset comprises a weekly monitoring record at three sites for six years, the second, a monthly monitoring record of 25 sites in the same catchment for one year, and the third, an assessment of DOC export from litter and soil carbon stocks. Our results suggest that DOC concentration significantly increased from the peaty headwaters to the mixed land-use areas (ANOVA F = 12.52, p < 0.001, df = 2), leading to higher flux estimates at the downstream sites. We present evidence for three possible explanations: firstly, that poor sampling of high flows may lead to underestimation of DOC flux, second, that there are significant sources of DOC besides the peatland head-waters, and finally, that biological- and photo-degradation decreases the influence of upstream DOC sources. Our results provide evidence both for the targeting of catchment management in peatland areas as well as the need to consider DOC from agricultural and forested areas of the catchment.

AB Aims Climate warming and increasing nitrogen (N) deposition have influenced plant nutrient status and thus plant carbon (C) fixation and vegetation composition in boreal peatlands. Phenols, which are secondary metabolites in plants for defense and adaptation, also play important roles in regulating peatland C dynamics due to their anti-decomposition properties. However, how the phenolic levels of different functional types of plants vary depending on nutrient availability remain unclear in boreal peatlands.
   Methods Here, we investigated total phenols contents (TPC) and total tannins contents in leaves of 11 plant species in 18 peatlands of the Great Hing'an Mountains area in northeastern China, and examined their variations with leaf N and phosphorus (P) and underlying mechanisms.
   Important Findings Shrubs had higher TPC than graminoids, indicating less C allocation to defense and less uptake of organic N in faster-growing and nonmycorrhizal graminoids than in slower-growing and mycorrhizal shrubs. For shrubs, leaf TPC decreased with increasing N contents but was not influenced by changing leaf phosphorus (P) contents, which suggested that shrubs would reduce the C investment for defense with increasing N availability. Differently, leaf TPC of graminoids increased with leaf N contents and decreased with leaf P contents. As graminoids are more N-limited and less P-limited, we inferred that graminoids would increase the defensive C investment under increased nutrient availability. We concluded that shrubs would invest more C in growth than in defense with increasing N availability, but it was just opposite for graminoids, which might be an important mechanism to explain the resource competition and encroachment of shrubs in boreal peatlands in the context of climate warming and ever-increasing N deposition.

AB Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in single plant components in Sphagnum peat have a good potential to reveal environmental changes in peat archives. Two peat profiles, covering the past similar to 6000 years, and a Sphagnum hummock from a discontinuous permafrost area in west central Canada were studied in order to evaluate the effect of decomposition rate on isotope records and to assess which plant components are most suitable for climate reconstructions. The stable isotope values from the most recently forming Sphagnum tissues were compared with observational climate data to study the impact of variations in temperature and precipitation on the peat isotopes. Our results show that there is high correlation between delta C-13 values in alpha-cellulose isolated from Sphagnum fuscum stems and summer temperatures, whereas delta O-18 in the plant tissues is controlled by several factors, such as summer precipitation, summer temperature and evaporation. According to our results, decomposition as derived from C/N values and colorimetry does not seem to affect the oxygen and carbon isotope values of alpha-cellulose from Sphagnum fuscum peat significantly. There is, however, a (quasi-) constant offset between the isotope values of branches and stems and between whole plant material and alpha-cellulose, which makes it crucial to select single moss-fractions when past climate and environmental changes are to be derived from the isotope record.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to take the early Permian no.6 coal seam in Jungar coalfield of North China as an example, this paper studied the net primary productivity (NPP) level of the early Permian peatland and its relationship with the atmospheric environment at that time, analyzed the influence of the atmospheric environment, and discussed its control factors. Design/methodology/approach First, geophysical logging signals were used for a spectrum analysis to obtain the Milankovitch cycle parameters in the no. 6 coal seam, including the eccentricity (95 ka); obliquity (35.6 ka); and precession (21.2 ka). These were then used to calculate the accumulation rate of the residual carbon in the no. 6 coal seam, which was determined to be between 49.44 and 50.57 gC/(m(2) center dot a). The carbon loss could be calculated according to the density and residual carbon content of the no. 6 coal seam. Then, the total carbon accumulation rate of the peatland was further derived as being between 64.91 and 66.40 gC/(m(2) center dot a). Also, the NPP of the peatland was determined to be between 129.82 and 132.8 gC/(m(2) center dot a). Finding The result showed that the NPP of the early Permian peatland area was lower than that of the Holocene at the same latitude, and also lower than that of the later Permian of South China. Originality/value This study's comprehensive analysis indicated that the temperature and humidity conditions, along with the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, were the main control factors of the NPP of the early Permian peatland. Also, wildfires were found to play a role.

   RESPONSES
AB Signy Island, maritime Antarctic, lies within the region of the Southern Hemisphere that is currently experiencing the most rapid rates of environmental change. In this study, peat cores up to 2m in depth from four moss banks on Signy Island were used to reconstruct changes in moss growth and climatic characteristics over the late Holocene. Measurements included radiocarbon dating (to determine peat accumulation rates) and stable carbon isotope composition of moss cellulose (to estimate photosynthetic limitation by CO 2 supply and model CO 2 assimilation rate). For at least one intensively 14C-dated Chorisodontium aciphyllum moss peat bank, the vertical accumulation rate of peat was 3.9mmyr-1 over the last 30years. Before the industrial revolution, rates of peat accumulation in all cores were much lower, at around 0.61mmyr-1. Carbon-13 discrimination (?), corrected for background and anthropogenic source inputs, was used to develop a predictive model for CO 2 assimilation. Between 1680 and 1900, there had been a gradual increase in ?, and hence assimilation rate. Since 1800, assimilation has also been stimulated by the changes in atmospheric CO 2 concentration, but a recent decline in ? (over the past 50100years) can perhaps be attributed to documented changes in temperature and/or precipitation. The overall increase in CO 2 assimilation rate (13C proxy) and enhanced C accumulation (14C proxy) are consistent with warmer and wetter conditions currently generating higher growth rates than at any time in the past three millennia, with the decline in ? perhaps compensated by a longer growing season.

AB BackgroundThe functioning of ecosystems is highly variable through space and time. Climatic and edaphic factors are forcing ecological communities to converge, whereas the diversity of plant assemblages dampens these effects by allowing communities' dynamics to diverge. This study evaluated whether the growing season phenology of wetland plant communities within landscapes is determined by the climatic/edaphic factors of contrasted regions, by the species richness of plant communities, or by the diversity of plant assemblages. From 2013 to 2016, we monitored the phenology and floristic composition of 118 wetland plant communities across five landscapes distributed along a gradient of edaphic and climatic conditions in the Province of Quebec, Canada.ResultsThe growing season phenology of wetlands was driven by differences among plant assemblage within landscapes, and not by the species richness of each individual community (<1% of the explained variation). Variation in the growing season length of wetlands reflected the destabilizing effect of climatic and edaphic factors on green-up dates, which is opposed to the dampening effect of plant assemblage diversity on green-down dates.ConclusionsThe latter dampening effect may be particularly important in the context of increasing anthropogenic activities, which are predicted to impair the ability of wetlands to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. Our findings suggest that stakeholders should not necessarily consider local species-poor plant communities of lower conservation value to the global functioning of wetland ecosystems.

AB The evolution of the natural environment of the middle mountains of the Southern Sikhote-Alin is reconstructed for the last 4.9 ka by data of the comprehensive study (botanic, diatom, and pollen analysis) of two peat swamps on the Sergeev Plateau. Radiocarbon dates and the position of the B-Tm marker ash layer of the Baitoushan Volcano, which erupted in the tenth century, are used to determine the chronology of events. An age model is constructed and peat accumulation rates and ash content in the peat are analyzed. It is revealed that the belt of dark coniferous forests at altitudes of about 900 m is relatively stable, while multidirectional climatic variations caused sharp changes in the predominating peat-forming plants. Unstable climatic conditions determined most of the features of the hydrological regime of the swamps. Reduced groundwater level and a greater role of atmospheric precipitation were usually related to cold events. Fires were one of the factors determining the landscape development; their frequency and intensity are determined. The longest period of intensive fires occurred in the last millennium. It is proposed that they may be of anthropogenic origin and related to the development of the area in the Middle Ages.

AB The Vancleve coal bed was studied geochemically, palynologically, and petrographically near the type area of the Vancleve coal bed, where new road construction has provided fresh exposures. In the study area, the Vancleve coal is relatively thin (<76 cm), low in ash yield (avg. 7.0%, dry basis), and high in overall total sulfur content (avg. 33%, dry basis). Three very thin (<10 cm thick) leader coals are present at two of the six sample locations. The leader coals are high in ash yield (avg. 29.4%, dry basis), and high, but variable, total sulfur content (avg. 5.0%, range 1.1 to 8.8%, dry basis).
   Palynologically, the coal is dominated by Lycospora (avg. 80.4%), the dispersed spore genus of Lepidophloios, Lepidodendron, and Paralycopodites. Lycospora micropapillata and Lycospora orbicula, both of which were produced by Paralycopodites, an ecotonal, colonizing lycopod, are more prevalent near the base of the coal bed. Lycospora pellucida, Lycospora granulata (produced by Lepidophloios), and Lycospora pusilla (produced by Lepidodendron) are more abundant in the middle and upper portions of the bed. Spores and pollen from other Pennsylvanian plant groups are minor in occurrence. Biostratigraphically, the coal is transitional Westphalian A/B in age, containing both Late Langsettian, and Early Duckmantian elements. Petrographically, the coal is high in vitrinite content (avg. 80.5%, mmf), with telovitrinite occurring more commonly than detrovitrinite and gelovitrinite (avg. TV / DV + GV = 33). Liptinite (avg. 9.4%, mmf) and inertinite (10.2%, mmf) occur in minor amounts by comparison. The average random vitrinite reflectance of the Vancleve coal is 0.54%, and the average calculated maximum vitrinite reflectance is 0.58%, indicating the Vancleve coal to be high volatile C/B bituminous in rank, in the study area.
   Low ash yields are often considered indicative, at least in part, of ombrotrophic (raised) mire origins in Pennsylvanian coal beds. However, the dominance of Lycospora, vitrinite macerals, and high sulfur contents indicates that the Vancleve coal bed is most likely formed from a planar, rheothrophic mire, with a consistently high water table. Low ash yields indicate that the paleomire was not subjected to any large influxes of sediment during peat accumulation from extra-mire sources.
   Palynologically, the very thin (<10 cm thick) leader coals, more diverse in composition, though remain Lycospora dominant. Petrographically, they are high in vitrinite content, but have lower TV / DV + GV ratios (avg. 2.0). Collectively, these data indicate that the leader coals also formed from planar, rheotrophic mires, though with substantially more influence from extra mire sediment sources.
   The coal is locally capped and cutout by paleochannels. Sediments from a heterolithic, laterally accreting channel appear to have locally loaded the peat when it was still pliable resulting in sandstone dikes and injection structures. Loading on pliable peat may also have led to slumping in the overlying channel fill. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work aimed to determine whether the organic carbon in wetland soils correlated with physico-chemical characteristics of wetlands (e.g. nutrient content, pH) and differentiated wetlands according to their plant community composition definied by the CORINE Biotope nomenclature. 96 wetlands were sampled in southeastern France, belonging to 14 CORINE habitats grouped into 3 CORINE hydrological categories: wet meadows, peatlands and aquatic wetlands. The total organic carbon content, the carbon content of humic fractions (humic acid (C-HA), fulvic acid (C-FA) and C-humin), and water extractable organic carbon were measured in samples collected in the upper 20 cm soil layer. These soil organic carbon fractions correlated with pH and soil nutrient content but differed slightly among the 14 CORINE habitats. In contrast, soil organic carbon fractions greatly differed among the 3 CORINE hydrological categories. The C-FA/C-HA ratio was significantly lower for wet meadows and peatlands and the proportion of C-Humin was significantly higher for peatlands and aquatic wetlands. These soil organic carbon fractions inform on the hydrological status of wetlands and may consequently be used as functional indicator in addition to a plant-based classification as the CORINE Biotope nomenclature.

AB Extreme summer droughts are expected to occur more often in the future in NW Europe due to climate change. These droughts might accelerate the rate of peat oxidation in drained peat areas, with impacts on soil subsidence, GHG emission and water quality. This study aimed at providing more insight in the oxidation of deep peat layers that had not previously been exposed to air, the so-called secondary decomposition.
   We incubated two types of peat (eutrophic and oligotrophic), sampled from permanently anoxic peat layers from nature reserves and agricultural peat meadows. Peat samples were incubated for thirteen weeks under anoxic conditions, but were exposed to air for one to eight weeks. The production of CO2 and CH4 was quantified as a proxy for decomposition; concentrations of soluble nutrients and phenolic compounds were also measured.
   The results showed that oxygenation led to a steep increase in the rate of decomposition, indicated by higher carbon loss rates during and after oxygenation compared to non-oxygenated samples. Carbon loss rates increased more for eutrophic peat (agricultural area: 352%, nature reserve: 182%) than for oligotrophic peat (83% and 159% respectively). Most peat samples investigated showed higher post-oxygenation CO2 and/or CH4 production compared to the anoxic pre-oxygenation period. This indicates that oxygenation stimulates decomposition, even after anoxic conditions have returned. Contrary to the enzymic latch theory, no effects of oxygenation on the concentrations of soluble or condensed phenolic compounds were detected. Soluble nutrient concentrations did not change due to oxygenation either. Noteworthy is the occurrence of pyrite mineralization and associated acidification in eutrophic peat. Thus, low summer water levels, for example due to climate change, should be avoided in order to limit exceptionally high decomposition rates and associated problems such as increasing subsidence rates, greenhouse gas emission, sulfate release and acidification.

AB Several laboratory experiments and field observations demonstrate that saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi effectively use pollen cytoplasm and suggest pollen produced by wind-pollinated trees as a crucial nutrient source for fungi and their plant hosts in nutrient-limited environments. However, the role of such interactions is still underestimated or neglected in ecology and paleoecology. Here, we consider pollen attacked by fungi in palynological records from Holocene raised peat bogs as a nutrient source for ecosystems in the past. The attacks occurred through the pollen germination areas by a variety of saprotrophic, ericoid mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal or dark septate endophyte fungi. Large amounts of attacked pollen in phases rich in Calluna vulgaris highlight the importance of Ericaceae shrubs, hosting ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and forming hotspots of decomposition in nutrient-deficit bogs. Applying estimations of pollen rain from literature, and based on own observed pollen infection rates we estimate the annual release of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium from pollen, and highlight their significance in pushing the ecosystem nutrient cycle in early spring time, when several species release their pollen. We highlight the significant role of anthropogenic changes in pollen deposition for pre-industrial bogs and hypothesize about the consequences of the pollen-based interrelation between wind-pollinated plants and their mycorrhizal fungi in paleoecology and evolution.

AB Despite the importance of nutrient availability in determining ecosystem structure and function, it is difficult to quantify in an absolute sense because of the complexity of nutrient cycles and methodological limitations. Others have compared nutrient availability indices for upland soils, but few comparative studies have been done in organic soils. Objectives of this study were, (i) to determine if N and P availability change in a predictable manner across an ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient in 16 wetlands in northern Minnesota, and (ii) to compare various laboratory and field indices of soil nutrient availability in a diverse group of organic soils. Ombrotrophic wetlands receive only atmospheric inputs of ions, while minerotrophic wetlands also receive groundwater or overland water inputs, We compared the following nutrient availability indices: 2- and 59-wk laboratory mineralization potentials, labile P and N pools determined from a kinetic mineralization model, total and extractable soil N and P pools, plant N and P concentrations, and H-OH and HCO3- charged resins, Most indices indicated that N availability increases along the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient, and correlations among indices were generally good, suggesting that they can be used somewhat interchangeably. Resins indicated a predominance of NO3-N availability during the growing season and NH4-N availability during the winter, and most indices indicated an increasing importance of nitrification in more minerotrophic wetlands, In contrast, P indices gave contrasting results across the gradient and were generally poorly correlated; however, the majority of the methods suggested that P availability is higher in minerotrophic swamp forests or beaver meadows, and that P availability is low in bugs and fens. We suggest that current methods of determining P availability may be inadequate in highly diverse organic soils. Plant nutrient concentrations did not show clear relationships with soil nutrient indices, particularly for N, which probably reflects the complicated relationship between soil nutrient availability and plant response in natural wetlands.

AB The importance of colloids and organic deposits for the transport of uranium isotopes from continental source regions and through the estuarine environment was investigated in the mire-rich Kalix River drainage basin in northern Sweden and the Baltic Sea. Ultrafiltration techniques were used to separate uranium and other elements associated with colloids > 10 kD and >3 kD from ''solute'' uranium and provided consistent results and high recovery rates for uranium as well as for other elements from large volume samples.
   Uranium concentrations in 0.45 mu m-filtered Kalix River water samples increased by a factor of 3 from near the headwaters in the Caledonides to the river mouth while major cation concentrations were relatively constant. U-234/U-238 ratios were high (delta(234)U = 770-1500) throughout the basin, without showing any simple pattern, and required a supply of U-234-rich water. Throughout the Kalix River, a large fraction (30-90%) of the uranium is carried by >10 kD colloids, which is compatible with uranium complexation with humic acids. No isotopic differences were found between colloid-associated and solute uranium.
   Within the Baltic Sea, about half of the uranium is removed at low salinities. The proportion that is lost is equivalent to that of river-derived colloid-bound uranium, suggesting that while solute uranium behaves conservatively during estuarine mixing, colloid-bound uranium is lost due to rapid flocculation of colloidal material. The association of uranium with colloids therefore may be an important parameter in determining uranium estuarine behavior.
   Mire peats in the Kalix River highly concentrate uranium and are potentially a significant source of recoil U-234 to the mirewaters and river waters. However, mirewater data clearly demonstrate that only small U-234/U-238 shifts are generated relative to inflowing groundwater. A simple box model of uranium accumulation in peat and transport through the mire that is compatible with the mire data demonstrates that with efficient removal of uranium from solution, only small shifts in U-234/U-238 ratios can be generated in mirewater uranium. The measurements and model calculations show that mirewaters are not the primary source of the uranium in the river. Bedrock groundwaters with high U-234/U-238 ratios and uranium concentrations must be the dominant source of riverine uranium. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The process for producing activated carbon from peat was optimized. The peat was impregnated with different ratios of ZnCl2, and the impregnated biomass was activated at different temperatures. The specific surface area, pore size distribution, total carbon content, and yield of the activated carbon were investigated. The best results for the specific surface area and mesoporosity of the activated peat were obtained by using a high impregnation ratio (2) and high activation temperature (1073 K). Highly porous activated carbon was produced that had a specific surface area of approximately 1000 m(2)/g and total pore volume that was higher than 0.5 cm(3)/g for most samples. The activated carbon had a high degree of mesoporosity. The adsorptive properties of the activated carbon were determined with methylene blue and orange II dyes.

ID BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; DAMPING-OFF; PATTERNS; ROT
AB In a commercial closed hydroponic greenhouse system, the microflora inhabiting the root and the nutrient solution of peat and rockwool grown tomato were studied on the basis of viable count (colony forming units, CFU), functional diversity using sole carbon source utilization (SCSU) patterns and taxonomic diversity using phospholipid fatty acid (PLEA) profiles. Sampling was done during one growing season, from May to October. Viable count of bacteria inhabiting the roots showed that the number of general bacterial flora and of fluorescent pseudomonads was higher in rockwool than peat while the amount of general fungal microflora, actinomycetes and Trichoderma was higher in peat than in rockwool grown tomato plants. For the irrigation effluent, no significant differences were found with respect to the general bacterial flora. The number of fluorescent pseudomonads decreased during the observation period whereas the number of actinomycetes rose towards the end of the experiment. For the general fungal flora and Trichoderma, viable counts showed significantly lower CFU for the samplings in August and September compared with the other sampling incidents. Furthermore, SCSU patterns and PLFA profiles showed differences in the root microflora with respect to growing medium and to sampling incidents. A separation of the microflora inhabiting the nutrient solution between the sampling incidents could also be done. This indicates that all three methods showed that the composition and the function of the microflora inhabiting the root and the nutrient solution shifted during the growing season and were different with respect to the growing medium.

AB Smoldering is the dominant combustion process in peat fire, releasing a large amount of carbon and smoke into the atmosphere. The spread of smoldering in peatland is a multi-dimensional process, which is slow, low-temperature, persistent, and difficult to detect. In this work, we investigate the upward spread of peat fire from the underground to the surface after forced ignition which is a relevant configuration but rarely studied. In the experiment, ignition is not possible if the igniter is deeper than 15 cm below the free surface, regardless of moisture content or density. Once ignited, the 1st-stage upward fire spread is initiated towards the free surface (opposed smoldering) with a peak temperature of 300 degrees C, leaving behind a char structure that does not collapse. Then, a 2nd-stage downward spread (forward smoldering) is activated with a peak temperature of 600 degrees C and regression of free surface. The upward spread is faster than the downward spread. The rates of both upward and downward spread decrease as the peat density or depth is increased. These experimental observations are successfully captured by a ID computational model of heat and mass transfer with 5-step kinetics. Modelling results further suggest that (1) the oxygen diffusion controls the entire upward-to-downward spread of peat fire, (2) the oxidation of peat sustains the 1st-stage upward spread, and (3) the oxidation of char sustains the 2nd-stage downward spread. This is the first study investigating the upward spread of peat fire, which helps understand the persistence of peat fire and guide the fire prevention and suppression strategies.

AB Prunus laurocerasus 'Otto Luyken' was grown in a peat-free and in a white peat substrate in 5 L containers for 7 months. The peat-free substrate consisted of 40 % substrate compost, 30 % bark compost and 30 % wood fibre. The slow release fertilizer Osmocote (400 mg N L-1) and the organic fertilizer MALTaflor were used. MALTaflor was given in two doses: 400 mg N L-1 and 800 mg N L-1. Irrigation was carried out as trickle irrigation when the water tension reached 100 hPa.
   Physical properties of both substrates and stability of the N balance of the peat-free substrate were determined. During the experiment, plant growth, N uptake, mineral N content of the substrate and leaching of N, P, and K were measured.
   The amount of available wafer is less in the peat-free than in the white peat substrate. The incubation test showed an N immobilization of 138 mg N L-1 for the peat-free substrate.
   In both substrates marketable plants were produced. N uptake in the course of time followed the same patterns as fresh matter production. However, fresh matter and N uptake were less in the peat-free than in the white peat substrate. This cannot be attributed to low N content of the substrate, since they were higher in the peat-free than in the white peat substrate during the whole growth period. Higher water tensions in the peat-free substrate are supposed to impair spatial availability of N for the organic fertilizer from which only 25 % was mixed into the substrate at potting and 3 further doses were given as topdressing.
   In the first 5 weeks after potting leaching of N was higher for the peat-free than for the white peat substrate. At the end of the growing season the differences between fertilizers were larger than those between the substrates. Leaching for Osmocote was higher than for MALTaflor, even for the high dose of MALTaflor. More K and P were leached from the peat-free substrate than from white peat. From the peat-free substrate more K was leached than was added by the fertilizer.

AB The magnitude of future emissions of greenhouse gases from the northern permafrost region depends crucially on the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC) that has accumulated over millennia in these perennially frozen soils. Many recent studies have used radiocarbon (C-14) to quantify the release of this "old" SOC as CO2 or CH4 to the atmosphere or as dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) to surface waters. We compiled similar to 1,900 C-14 measurements from 51 sites in the northern permafrost region to assess the vulnerability of thawing SOC in tundra, forest, peatland, lake, and river ecosystems. We found that growing season soil C-14-CO2 emissions generally had a modern (post-1950s) signature, but that well-drained, oxic soils had increased CO(2)emissions derived from older sources following recent thaw. The age of CO2 and CH4 emitted from lakes depended primarily on the age and quantity of SOC in sediments and on the mode of emission, and indicated substantial losses of previously frozen SOC from actively expanding thermokarst lakes. Increased fluvial export of aged DOC and POC occurred from sites where permafrost thaw caused soil thermal erosion. There was limited evidence supporting release of previously frozen SOC as CO2, CH4, and DOC from thawing peatlands with anoxic soils. This synthesis thus suggests widespread but not universal release of permafrost SOC following thaw. We show that different definitions of "old" sources among studies hamper the comparison of vulnerability of permafrost SOC across ecosystems and disturbances. We also highlight opportunities for future C-14 studies in the permafrost region.

AB Pollen assemblage changes and stable hydrogen isotope analysis of mosses (Sphagnum magellanicum and Drepanocladus s.l.) from a bog in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, provided independent proxies for reconstructing changes in effective moisture and temperature over the past 16,000 cal yr B.P. A deterministic model was used to reconstruct the stable hydrogen isotope composition of meteoric water from the D/H ratios of bog mosses over the last 16,000 years. Abrupt changes in temperature, as recorded in D/H ratios of moss cellulose, were accompanied by synchronous changes in vegetation composition during the late Pleistocene and early and middle Holocene, when moisture levels were lower than today. In contrast, temperature variability during the late Holocene was not accompanied by comparable vegetation changes. In particular, grass pollen (Poaceae) increased during periodic cold spells between 15,000 and 11,000 cal yr B.P., but a cold spell of similar magnitude ca. 2000 cal yr B.P did not appear to affect vegetation. During the late Pleistocene, the isotopic record from the peat core shows variations similar to the D/H ratios in the Antarctic Taylor Dome ice core. However, the timing of the changes in the Harberton record is more in line with the timing of other Southern Hemisphere records. (C) 2001 University of Washington.

AB Ecohydrological functioning of natural Boreal forest in Canada's Boreal Plains is a product of interactions between soil hydrophysical characteristics and hydrogeochemical processes. These interactions create a moisture-nutrient gradient within the surface soils, increasing along low-relief transitions from upland to riparian zone, and in turn influence the distribution of vegetation communities. It is not yet known if/when analogous ecohydrological functions can be achieved in constructed uplands following industrial disturbance, such as that following oil sands development. Hence, to assess this, we studied interactions between hydrogeochemical processes and vegetation colonization in a constructed upland relative to hydrophysical properties of 2 reclamation cover substrates during a typical continental climate's growing season. Our results indicated that in 3years of postconstruction, the establishment of a moisture-nutrient gradient that supports vegetation colonization along slope positions was still limited by heterogeneity of cover substrates. Portions of the upland under peat-mineral mix were characterized by lower nutrient availability, high moisture content, and establishment of planted shrubs and trees. In contrast, forest floor materials plots were characterized by poor soil quality, but higher nutrient availability and greater colonization of invasive grasses and native shrubs. We suggest that the colonization of underdeveloped soils by invasive grasses may facilitate pedogenic processes and thus should be accepted by reclamation managers as a successional milestone in the recovery of ecohydrological functioning of constructed uplands. Poor soil structure under forest floor materials could not support edaphic conditions required by plants to efficiently utilize fertilizer, making this practise futile at the early stage of soil development.

AB Mercury (Hg) concentration profiles and historical accumulation rates were determined in three Pb-210-dated cores from a peat deposit in the vicinity of a lead (Pb) smelter at Pribram, Czech Republic. The Hg concentrations in peat samples ranged from 66 to 701 mu gkg(-1). Cumulative Hg inventories from each core (for the past similar to 150yr) varied by a factor of 1.4 (13.6-18.5mgHgm(-2)), indicating variations of net Hg accumulation rate within the peat deposit. Historical changes in vegetation cover (leading to variable interception by trees) are probably responsible for this variation in space and time. The uncorrected Hg accumulation rates peaked between the 1960s and 1980s (up to 226 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)). Recent findings show that Hg records from peat tend to overestimate historical levels of Hg deposition. Therefore we used the mass loss compensation factor (MLCF) to normalize Hg accumulation rates. These corrected Hg accumulation rates were significantly lower (maximum 129 mu g m(-2) yr(1)) and better corresponded to changes in historical smelter emissions, which were highest in the 1960s. The agreement between the corrected Hg accumulation rates in the uppermost peat sections (2-38 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)) and biomonitoring of atmospheric deposition by mosses in several recent years (4.7-34.4 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)) shows the usefulness of MLCF application on Hg accumulation in peat archives. However, the MLCF correction Was unsuitable for Pb. The recent Pb deposition rates obtained by an independent biomonitoring Study using mosses (0.5-127 mgm(-2) yr(-1)) were better correlated with net Pb accumulation rates recorded in peat (7-145 mg m(-2) yr(-1)) than with corrected rates obtained by the MLCF approach (1-28 mg m(-2) yr(-1)).

AB In organic soils, hydraulic conductivity is related to the degree of decomposition and soil compression, which reduce the effective pore diameter and consequently restrict water flow. This study investigates how the size distribution and geometry of air-filled pores control the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of peat soils using high-resolution (45 mu m) three-dimensional (3D) X-ray computed tomography (CT) and digital image processing of four peat sub-samples from varying depths under a constant soil water pressure head. Pore structure and configuration in peat were found to be irregular, with volume and cross-sectional area showing fractal behaviour that suggests pores having smaller values of the fractal dimension in deeper, more decomposed peat, have higher tortuosity and lower connectivity, which influences hydraulic conductivity. The image analysis showed that the large reduction of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with depth is essentially controlled by air-filled pore hydraulic radius, tortuosity, air-filled pore density and the fractal dimension due to degree of decomposition and compression of the organic matter. The comparisons between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity computed from the air-filled pore size and geometric distribution showed satisfactory agreement with direct measurements using the permeameter method. This understanding is important in characterizing peat properties and its heterogeneity for monitoring the progress of complex flow processes at the field scale in peatlands.

AB A fumigated nursery bed on a sandy loam was inoculated with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius and seeded with Acacia nilotica. Two types of inoculum were compared: mycelium grown in a vermiculite/peat mixture and mycelium grown in liquid medium and entrapped in a calcium alginate gel with different quantities of mycelium. At the end of the first growing season the alginate inoculum at the dose of 4 g mycelium (dry weight) per m(2) proved to be the most efficient. The top dry weight of the seedlings in this treatment was 2.0 fold that of the non-inoculated fumigated controls. This inoculation treatment also ensured 90 percent mycorrhizal infection by Pisolithus tinctorius.

AB Background: Habitat models provide information about which habitat management should target to avoid species extinctions or range contractions. The willow ptarmigan inhabits alpine-and arctic tundra habitats in the northern hemisphere and is listed as near threatened (NT) in the Norwegian red list due to declining population size. Habitat alteration is one of several factors affecting willow ptarmigan populations, but there is a lack of studies quantifying and describing habitat selection in willow ptarmigan. We used data from an extensive line transect survey program from 2014 to 2017 to develop resource selection functions (RSF) for willow ptarmigan in Norway. The selection coefficients for the RSF were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model fitted with random intercepts for each area. We predicted relative probability of selection across Norway and quantile-binned the predictions in 10 RSF bins ranging from low-(1) to high-(10) relative probability of selection.
   Results: Random cross-validation suggest that our models were highly predictive, but validation based spatial blocking revealed that the predictability was better in southern parts of Norway compared to the northernmost region. Willow ptarmigan selected for herb-rich meadows and avoided lichen rich heathlands. There was generally stronger selection for vegetation types with dense field layer and for rich bogs and avoidance of vegetation types with sparse field layer cover and for lowland forest. Further, willow ptarmigan selected for areas around the timberline and for intermediate slopes. Mapping of the RSF showed that 60% of Norway is in the lowest ranked RSF bin and only 2% in the highest ranked RSF bin.
   Conclusions: Willow ptarmigan selected for vegetation types with dense field layer and bogs at intermediate slopes around the timberline. Selection coincides with previous habitat selection studies on willow ptarmigan. This is the first attempt to assess and quantify habitat selection for willow ptarmigan at a large scale using data from line transect distance sampling surveys. Spatial variation in predictability suggests that habitat selection in late summer might vary from north to south. The resource selection map can be a useful tool when planning harvest quotas and habitat interventions in alpine areas.

AB Considerable nitrogen (N) mineralization occurs in drained peat soils in use for dairy grassland, due to aerobic decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). N losses may be limited by matching grass N uptake with N mineralization and by adapting on-farm fertilization schemes to soil N supply (SNS) and apparent N recovery (ANR). Previous attempts to predict SNS of peat grasslands from soil parameters have been unsuccessful, partly due to high variation in SNS between sites and years. In this paper, we present field data from twenty dairy grasslands on drained peat (29-65% SOM; Terric Histosols). Grass yield parameters (e.g. SNS and ANR) were compared with a comprehensive data set of soil biotic and abiotic properties measured at the start of the growing season, and with N mineralization calculated from this data. SNS ranged between 171 and 377 kg N ha(-1) (mean: 264 kg N ha(-1)) during the growing season. Soil N mineralization estimated by laboratory incubation and by foodweb-based production ecological calculations gave similar mean values with slightly higher coefficients of variation, but correlations with SNS were not significant. Regression analysis with soil properties showed a positive correlation between SNS and soil Ca:Mg ratio and a negative correlation between fertilized grass yield and soil C:SOM ratio. No significant models were found for ANR. Based on our data and on literature, we conclude that these parameters indicate linkages between grass yield and soil physical-hydrological properties such as soil structure and water availability. In particular, the C:SOM ratio in these soils with high organic matter content may be an indicator of water repellency, and our results suggest that grass growth was limited by drought more than by nutrient availability.

AB To study the effects of seed soaking on seedling emergence and development in Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] two commercial seed lots were soaked for 15 h in aerated water. After soaking, floating and sunken seeds were separated and analyzed prior to being sown in peat-filled containers. Seedling development was followed for one growing season. All sunken seeds were viable according to radiography whereas the floating seeds contained a considerable number of larvae filled and empty seeds. Mean time of emergence of the sunken seeds was approximately 1.5 days shorter than control (i.e. dry) seeds and floating seeds. Soaking had no effect on the time taken for most germinants to emerge in both seed lots, thus failing to synchronize seedling emergence. The later a seedling would emerge, the more likely it was for it to die during the growing season or to be culled at the end of the growing season. Soaking had an inconsistent effect on stem diameter at the end of the growing season and no effect on stem or root biomass. Seedling size uniformity was equal in all treatments. This study suggests that soaking and seed sorting does not guarantee a more uniform seedling crop, but this technique may be useful in upgrading poor quality seed lots of Norway spruce containing a high number of empty or larva infested seeds.

AB The purpose of this study was to monitor the dynamics of gases such as CO2 and CH4 in a soil profile with sufficient temporal resolution to observe possible diurnal variations. A computer-controlled device called a membrane probes array (MPA) was developed that consisted of 9-12 individual membrane probes installed at various soil depths. Each probe was made of a stainless steel pipe with a 1 mm orifice covered with a silicone membrane. Soil gases diffuse through the membrane at a rate proportional to the ambient soil gas concentration. To measure diffusion rates, the probes are flushed with N-2 one-by-one at regular time intervals and accumulated gas is detected as a spike with IR and FID analyzers. The longer the period between flushings the higher the gas accumulation and the lower the detection limit for a particular soil gas. The developed MPA agreed well with conventional manual gas sampling in West-Siberian mesotrophic fen. In peat cores with intact Carex-Sphagnum vegetation incubated under constant temperature, water level and artificial light:dark (14: 10) cycles, regular diurnal oscillations of soil CO2 and CH4 occurred in the upper part of the peat core down to 19 cm. Gas content in the top layer (3 cm) grew during the light phase, and returned back during the dark phase. In layers further down in the soil, the same events were observed but with progressively increased time delay and lower amplitude. The obtained data agreed with the hypothesis that diurnal variations in soil CO2 and CH4 content are caused by periodic changes in intensity of root exudation that provide a major C- and energy source for soil microorganisms including methanogens. At a soil depth of 23 cm, where the peak of gas bubbles occurred, the signal for both gases became chaotic and not related to the light:dark cycle. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hummock-and-hollow microtopography is common in wetlands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The physical environment of hummocks contrasts strongly with that of hollows. To address how Primula nutans Georgi, a herbaceous species broadly distributed on the plateau, can inhabit both hummocks and hollows, we investigated the plasticity of its morphology and biomass growth in relation to the environmental variables during the growing season. The results are as follows: (1) total daily photosynthetic photon flux density, maximum soil temperature, and diurnal soil temperature range were significantly larger on the hummocks than in the hollows; (2) individual ramets had smaller leaves, higher leaf mass per unit area, and shorter petiole and peduncle length on the hummocks, but leaf and root dry weights per ramet differed little between microsites; (3) P. nutans allocated most of its dry mass to peduncles and flowers and the proportion of reproductive mass was significantly higher for plants in the hollows than on the hummocks; (4) the coefficients of variation of most morphological and biometric parameters was higher on hummocks than in hollows. The results suggest that P. nutans favors hummocks but can tolerate hollows through morphological adjustments in that the mass investment to peduncles and flowers is much larger in plants in the hollows than hummocks.

AB Using ICP-SMS, a robust analytical protocol for accurate and precise determination of the isotopic Pb composition (Pb-206, Pb-207, Pb-208) of acid digests of peat samples was developed. External precision better than 0.05% and 0.1% for Pb concentrations in the range of 1 mug l(-1) and 0.1 mug l(-1), respectively, were achieved for both Pb-207/Pb-206 and Pb-208/Pb-206 ratios. This precision has never before been achieved with ICP-SMS in a complex matrix containing such low concentrations of total Pb. Procedural Pb blank concentrations amounted to 0.003 mug l(-1) and had no influence on the accuracy of the Pb isotope ratios. Corrections for mass discrimination were accomplished using the certified isotopic reference material SRM 981. However, mass discrimination was found to be non-systematic, and varied among the masses both with respect to magnitude and direction. To accommodate this phenomenon, an individual mass discrimination correction was applied to each ratio resulting in improved accuracy. Using this approach, the mass discrimination for both Pb isotope ratios was <0.2%, compared to values on the order of +/-0.35% if only a single Pb isotope ratio was used. The accuracy and precision of the ICP-SMS protocol was further evaluated using thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS) of selected samples and an in-house peat reference material. In general, the Pb isotope ratios determined using ICP-SMS deviated from the TIMS values by less than <0.1%. Given the throughput of the ICP-SMS compared to the TIMS (which requires chemical separation of Pb), the approach described offers great promise for environmental studies to fingerprint the predominant sources of anthropogenic Pb. Two applications are presented here: a bog profile from the Black Forest (SW Germany) consisting of eight thousand years of peat accumulation, and a depth profile through a snowpack collected from the same site during the winter of 2003.

AB Only 0 center dot 20-0 center dot 70 of the fertilizer-nitrogen (N) applied to grassland is taken up in herbage in the harvest directly following application. Residual effects at subsequent harvests can be large but are poorly quantified, and rarely taken into account in current management practices. An increased understanding of N-use efficiency per harvest can improve operational management. This study systematically assessed the residual effects of previously applied N fertilizer on N uptake, dry matter (DM) yield and soil mineral-N (SMN) during the whole of the growing season. It is based on field experiments conducted on peat and mineral soils in 1991-1994. Statistical models were derived for SMN, N uptake and DM yield as a function of previously and freshly applied N fertilizer. There were clear residual effects of previously applied N in later cuts. They were relatively greater at higher levels of N fertilizer. On peat soils, 0 center dot 15-0 center dot 25 of the N applied was recovered as SMN. On mineral soils the proportion was maximally 0 center dot 08. There was a clear relationship between SMN and N uptake in the subsequent cut on mineral soils but not on peat soils. The value of SMN as a tool to adjust fertilizer-N application rates was hence found to be limited. There were clear relationships between the amount of previously applied N and the N uptake in subsequent cuts, on both soil types and over the whole of the growing season. It was concluded that the total amount of previously applied N is a useful indicator for adjusting N-fertilizer application rates.

AB Spore capsules of four Sphagnum species were buried at different depths in peat on a bog. Spore viability was determined after 0, 1, 2 and 3 yr. Viability generally declined with time, but viable spores were still found at all depths after 3 yr. The light-coloured spores of S. balticum and S. tenellum retained their viability better than the darker spores of S. fuscum and S. lindbergii. Survival was highest under wet but aerobic conditions, but was also high under humid or periodically desiccated conditions. By contrast, most spores stored under wet, anaerobic conditions died within 2-3 yr. These results, and predictions from them, are not consistent with earlier results for spores of long-lived and dominant bryophytes, or for seeds of phanerogams of undisturbed wetlands and forests. There was no correlation between spore size and longevity across species, but the small spores from small capsules of S. balticum and S. tenellum generally showed higher viability than those from the medium-sized and large capsules of the same species. This suggests a positive intraspecific relationship between longevity and dispersal distance. There was an indication of conditional dormancy, controlled by weather, in Sphagnum spores. The experiments indicate that Sphagnum spores can form a long-term persistent spore bank under suitable conditions, with a half-life of between 1 and 20 yr (mean across species of 2.6 and 5.0 yr at two depths studied), and with potential values in individual spore capsules of several decades, or even of centuries. Sphagnum spores kept refrigerated showed 15-35% viable spores after 13 yr. The capacity to form a persistent spore bank that can be activated whenever favourable conditions occur might help explain the wide geographical distribution of many Sphagnum species in the boreal and temperate zones, where they have managed to colonize almost every suitable patch of acidic, nutrient-poor wetland.

AB To initially characterize the dynamics and environmental controls of CO2, ecosystem CO2 fluxes were measured for different vegetation zones in a deep-water wetland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during the growing season of 2002. Four zones of vegetation along a gradient from shallow to deep water were dominated, respectively by the emergent species Carex allivescens V. Krez., Scirpus distigmaticus L., Hippuris vulgaris L., and the submerged species Potamogeton pectinatus L. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and net ecosystem production (NEP) were markedly different among the vegetation zones, with lower Re and GPP in deeper water. NEP was highest in the Scirpus-dominated zone with moderate water depth, but lowest in the Potamogeton-zone that occupied approximately 75% of the total wetland area. Diurnal variation in CO2 flux was highly correlated with variation in light intensity and soil temperature. The relationship between CO2 flux and these environmental variables varied among the vegetation zones. Seasonal CO2 fluxes, including GPP, Re, and NEP, were strongly correlated with aboveground biomass, which was in turn determined by water depth. In the early growing season, temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) for Re varied from 6.0 to 8.9 depending on vegetation zone. Q(10) decreased in the late growing season. Estimated NEP for the whole deep-water wetland over the growing season was 24 g C m(-2). Our results suggest that water depth is the major environmental control of seasonal variation in CO2 flux, whereas photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) controls diurnal dynamics.

AB Arsenic binding by sulfhydryl groups of natural organic matter (NOM) was recently identified as an important As sequestration pathway in the naturally As-enriched minerotrophic peatland Gala di Lago, Switzerland. Here, we explore the microscale distribution, elemental correlations, and chemical speciation of As in the Go la di Lago peat. Thin sections of undisturbed peat samples from 0-37 cm and 200-249 cm depth were analyzed by synchrotron microfocused X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) spectrometry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (mu-XAS). Additionally, peat samples were studied by bulk As, Fe, and S K-edge XAS. Micro-XRF analyses showed that As in the near-surface peat was mainly concentrated in 10-50 mu m sized hotspots, identified by mu-XAS as realgar (alpha-As4S4). In the deep peat layer samples, however, As was more diffusely distributed and mostly associated with particulate NOM of varying decomposition stages. The NOM-associated As was present as trivalent As bound by sulfhydryl groups. Arsenopyrite (FeAsS) and arsenian pyrite (FeAsxS2-x) of <25 mu m size, which have escaped detection by bulk As and Fe K-edge XAS, were found as minor As species in the peat. Bulk S K-edge XAS revealed that the deep peat layers were significantly enriched in reduced organic S species. Our findings suggest an authigenic formation of realgar and arsenopyrite in strongly reducing microenvironments of the peat and indicate that As(III)-NOM complexes are formed by the passive sorption of As(III) to NOM. This reaction appears to be favored by a combination of abundant reduced organic S and comparatively low As solution concentrations preventing the formation of secondary As-bearing sulfides.

AB Warming greatly reshapes carbon cycle of peatlands where soil is water saturated with anaerobic condition prevailing all the year round. However, little is known about the response of anaerobic mineralization of peatlands carbon to global warming, especially when considering the difference of soil from above water table (AWT) and below water table (BWT). This study measured variations in soil carbon anaerobic mineralization as a function of warming and depth by sampling 100-cm soil columns in Zoige plateau. Warming enhanced carbon anaerobic mineralization significantly with different increments among the whole depths. The response of CO2-C and CH4-C to warming varied with depth: at surface soil, both CO2-C and CH4-C emission increased with higher increment; at deep soil, CO2-C emission increased with small increment and CH4-C emission decreased. Substrate availability influenced carbon anaerobic mineralization rate and pathway. Substantial resistant carbon at deep soil lowered CO2 increment and varied CH4 production pathway. The temperature sensitivity of peat carbon anaerobic mineralization varied with depth, suggesting the heterogeneous distribution of soil substrate among the whole depths. AWT soil was higher in temperature sensitivity than BWT soil for the substantial simple carbon and higher microbial/enzyme activity at AWT. BWT soil was a major contributor of the amount of carbon emission and the total increased carbon caused by warming. Further, for the management of peatlands, we should conduct advanced research by focusing more towards the soil of whole depth, especially on the temperature sensitivity of AWT soil and the contribution to total carbon emission of BWT soil.

   physiognomic approach; dominance-types; Braun-Blanquet approach; Taiwan
AB The complexity of natural conditions leads to the complexity of vegetation types of Taiwan of China, which has both tropical and cold-temperate vegetation types, and could be depicted as the vegetation miniature of China or even for the world. The physiognomic-floristic principle was adopted for the vegetation classification of Taiwan. The units of rank from top to bottom are: class of vegetation-type, order of vegetation-type, vegetation-type, alliance group, alliance and association. The high-rank units (class, order and vegetation-type) are classified by ecological physiognomy, while the median and lower units by the species composition of community. At the same time the role of dominant species and character species will also be considered. The dominant species are the major factor concerned with the median ranks (alliance group, and alliance) because they are the chief components of community, additionally their remarkable appearance is easy to identify; the character species (or diagnostic species) are for relatively low ranks (association) because they will clearly show the interspecies relation-ship and the characteristics of community. According to this principle, vegetation of Taiwan is classi-fied into five classes of vegetation-types (forests, thickets, herbaceous vegetation, rock fields vegetation, swamps and aquatic vegetation), 29 orders of vegetation-types (cold-temperate needle-leaved forests, cool-temperate needle-leaved forests, warm-temperate needle-leaved forests, warm needle-leaved forests, deciduous broad-leaved forests, mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forests, evergreen mossy forests, evergreen sclerophyllous forests, evergreen broad-leaved forests, tropical rain forests, tropical monsoon forests, coastal forests, warm bamboo forests, evergreen needle-leaved thickets, sclerophyllous thickets, deciduous broad-leaved thickets, evergreen broad-leaved thickets, xerothermic thorn-succulent thickets, bamboo thickets, meadows, sparse shrub grasslands, savannahic grasslands, sparse scree communities, chasmophytic vegetation, woody swamps, herbaceous swamps, moss bogs, fresh water aquatic vegetation, salt water aquatic vegetation) and 53 vegetation-types. The main alliances of each vegetation-type are described.

DT Article
ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY
AB A field-scale, natural gradient solute transport experiment conducted at a Newfoundland blanket bog resulted in an asymmetrical plume owing to solute retardation in the dual-porosity matrix, An order of magnitude decrease in hydraulic conductivity 10-20 m downslope of the spill caused the transport rate to decrease and lateral dispersion to increase. Most transport occurred near the watertable and the transport rate increased as the watertable rose. Hydraulic conductivity between a depth of 0 and 0.2 m was 1.6 x 10(-2) m s(-1), whereas at a depth of 0.5 m it was 5-6 orders of magnitude lower owing to greater compaction and humification of the peat with depth. At a depth of 0.4-0.45 m diffusion may have become the dominant transport mechanism. In spite of the retardation process, the solute front's rate of movement was relatively high, about 2.3 m day(-1), owing to a combination of the high watertable during the study and a relatively steep hydraulic gradient of 0.055. Rain caused dilution and mixing of solute near the watertable, Evaporation did not have an appreciable effect on solute concentration, which is attributable to the high transport rate.

AB Paleoecological changes during the development of Lake Izyubrinye Solontsi from the Solontsovskie (Shanduyskie) Lakes located in the midlands of the Eastern Sikhote-Alin have been reconstructed. Lake formation is related to landslides on the paleovolcano slopes. A complex study of the peat-bog section (botanical, diatom, spore-pollen, and radiocarbon analysis) allows reconstructing paleoenvironmental changes with high resolution. A considerable variability of lake and swamp environments highly responsive to climate changes in the late Holocene has been revealed. Peat accumulation began about 4000(14)C BP. The main peat-forming plants were Sphagnum mosses and herbs, except for the period 2330aEuro'1530 C-14 BP (2360aEuro'1480 cal. BP), when a swamp overgrown by larch forests and predominantly woody peat accumulated. Forest ecosystems on the lake coasts were quite stable. The role of fir and broadleaved species increased in the composition of dark coniferous forests with Korean pine during the warm phases and the role of birch, in the cold phases; secondary forests occupied the low slopes during the last 1000 years. The age of paleofires has been determined.

ID LOW-TEMPERATURES; METHANE; SOILS
AB The conventional chamber technique was used to measure CH4 and CO2 emission to the atmosphere from snow-covered ombrotrophic bogs (57 degreesN, 82 degreesE, Plotnikovo, West Siberia). The average +/- standard deviation values for CH4 and CO2 fluxes in mid-February were found to be equal mg m(-2) d(-1) 5.0 +/- 3.7 and 69+/-52, respectively. The contribution of cold season to annual methane fluxes varied from 3.5 to 11% depending on the calculation method and was similar to that found in Alaska and northern Minnesota. The vertical profiles of gases in snow were linear implying the applicability of the simple diffusion equation under steady state conditions. The diffusion reduction factor due to porous resistance and tortuousity of snowpack was 0.18 and 0.29 for methane and carbon dioxide, respectively. Thus snow forms only a passive cap which controls the gas concentration at the snow-soil interface, while gas flux into the atmosphere is controlled by gas production in the soil: The fresh samples of frozen peat soil incubated under laboratory conditions at constant temperature -16 degreesC displayed very slow, but steady respiration varied from 0.05 to 0.2 mg CO2-C d(-1) dm(-3) depending on peat sampling depth. Although this activity was 200-300 times lower than soil respiration in summertime, it was enough to support the observed in situ winter CO2 emission. The thaw and subsequent peat incubation at 15 degreesC accelerated gas formation up to 2-5 mg CO2-C and 1.2 mg CH4-C h(-1) dm(-3) of peat after 3-4 days of incubation followed by a decline by I order of magnitude and approaching a new steady state level. Although the mechanism of freeze-thaw activation needs further clarification, it was nevertheless possible to simulate the observed activation dynamics by a mathematical model which accounts for the burst of microbial growth on nutrients released into soil from frost-damaged cells.

AB The relationship between phenanthrene sorption properties and petrography of low rank organic particles was investigated to aid in understanding sorption mechanisms, and confirm the previously observed impact of inertinite. Sorption experiments, using phenanthrene as the model organic chemical, were conducted on peat and lignite, of matrix and xylite-rich lithotypes, that have significant differences in inertinite content. Both peat and lignite samples display non-linear isotherms described by the Freundlich model. in general, the sorption isotherm linearity decreases from peat to lignite, and lignite samples show higher sorption capacities (K-fr = 4.2 - 10(4) -4.5 x 10(5)) than peat (K-fr=8.4x 10(3) -3 x 10(4)). Regression analysis applied to the maceral data and sorption parameters showed a strong correlation between inertinite and the variability of isotherm non-linearity. This correlation implies the significant impact of oxidized tissues to the heterogeneity of sorption sites. Moreover, the organic carbon normalized sorption coefficient (K-oc), at low phenanthrene concentrations, is related to the inertinite content, as well as to the organic carbon content (on dry, ash-free basis). The degree of inertinite effect on sorption (at low C-e) is higher in lignites than in peat or better, that it increases for samples with increasing organic carbon content (on dry, ash-free basis). This probably suggests that the inertinite content could be a measure of sorption non-linearity and affinity only among samples that have undergone common humification and/or coalification pathways.

AB We here preset a result of high-resolution pollen data of a lacustrine-peat sediment core from Yushenkule (YSKL) Peat, southern Altai Mountains, northwestern China. We aim to reconstruct the palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate variations in the southern Altai Mountains and further evaluate the role of autogenic process of the raised bog itself in driving the local vegetation dynamics. The pollen data of YSKL core-2 show two major vegetation stages in YSKL Peat area and the surrounding areas during the data-covering period. During the stage lasting from similar to 4870 to similar to 2550 cal. yr BP, regional vegetation was dominated by desert steppe and local vegetation in YSKL Peat was characterized by Artemisia-dominated mountain steppe. During the stage lasting from similar to 2550 to similar to 700 cal. yr BP, regional vegetation was characterized by Artemisia-dominated steppe and local vegetation in YSKL Peat was characterized by Cyperaceae-dominated wetland herbs. The Ar/Am (Artemisia/Amaranthaceae) ratio-indicated moisture increasing trend of southern Altai Mountains can attribute to the combined effects of decreased temperature and increased precipitation. The lithologic transition from lake to peat of YSKL core-2 can be explained by invoking the variations in the areal extent of ice covers in the Altai Mountains.

AB Soil profile, macrofossil and pollen analysis investigations were carried out at two sites within paludifying pine forest to determine the vegetation succession and paludification history of the area. Isostatic uplift raised the area above sea level less than 500 y ago. Before the land emerged from the sea, Phragmites and Schoenoplectus beds grew in shallow water close to the shore. As the area emerged, shore meadows dominated by grasses, sedges and forbs became established and were in turn replaced by alder woods, Mixed birch and alder woods then developed and the formation of an organic layer started with the accumulation of humus. Birch then largely replaced alder but both were superseded by pine forest about 50 y before the start of the investigation. After pine forest establishment, Sphagnum invaded, peat accumulation started and paludification was under way. Soil waterlogging necessary for paludification to proceed was a result of a low hydraulic head and shallow hydraulic gradient between the study area and the sea. The vegetation succession is comparable with contemporary succession around the present coastline of Hailuoto and on other Finnish islands. Paludification of the area was an autogenic process; no anthropogenic influences were detected. The relevance of this to the origin of blanket mire in Britain during prehistoric times is discussed. It is suggested that more evidence is required to clarify the roles of forest clearance and climate in the inception of blanket mire in Britain.

AB The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of manure on retention of selenium (Se) in soil. Addition of cattle manure in combination with selenite and selenate reduced the adsorption of both anions to a loam soil in a batch experiment. The results were explained by the content of low-molecular-weight organic acids in the manure which compete with Se for the sorption sites. In a pot experiment with loam and peat soils and with two pH levels within each soil, cattle slurry added together with selenate was found to increase the Se concentration in grain at the highest pH level (6.1 and 6.8 for the loam and peat, respectively). At a lower pH (5.4 and 6.0 for the loam and peat, respectively) there was no significant effect of slurry on Se concentration in grain. Application of slurry also increased the residual effect of Se applied to the loam soil in the preceding growing season. In the peat soil, no residual effect of Se was found either with or without the addition of slurry.

AB In a study on northern treatment wetlands, we examined whether P adsorption capacity remained high, with maintained P retention, after almost 20 years of loading. We also examined the most important processes for the treatment wetlands as a long-term P sink and analysed peat and water quality in the peat soils of the wetland. We tested P adsorption capacity by comparing batch test results with peat P and pore water PO4-P concentrations. The results showed that P adsorption capacity in the treatment wetland did not change in a 12-year period according to batch testing but the maximum sorption capacity may have been reached, although P retention level remained high after almost 20 years of wetland use. Phosphorus accumulation through peat accretion as a long-term sink was only of minor importance for P retention (0.5-7%). The main retention mechanisms for P in runoff in the wetlands were found to be filtration, sedimentation and precipitation with metals. Iron (Fe) accumulation in the surface peat indicated that its origin was peat extraction runoff. Thus long-term P retention depends on the hydrogeological setting and the quality of the water, which depends on the source. Calculations based on inlet/outlet loads from treatment wetlands may not always provide a reliable estimate of long-term P retention due to occasional P release from Fe under anaerobic conditions. Therefore new sites or sites experiencing problems with P retention should be sampled to determine the balance between peat P content and pore water PO4-P concentration and the availability of metals for precipitation.

AB Coastal wetlands are susceptible to loss in both health and extent via stressors associated with global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Peat collapse may represent an additional phenomenon contributing to coastal wetland loss in organic-rich soils through rapid vertical elevation decline. However, the term "peat collapse" has been inconsistently used in the literature, leading to ambiguities regarding the mechanisms, timing, and spatial extent of its contribution to coastal wetland loss. For example, it is unclear whether peat collapse is distinct from general subsidence, or what biogeochemical changes or sequence of events may constitute peat collapse. A critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature related to peat collapse was supplemented with fundamental principles of soil physics and biogeochemistry to develop a conceptual framework for coastal wetland peat collapse. We propose that coastal wetland peat collapse is a specific type of shallow subsidence unique to highly organic soils in which a loss of soil strength and structural integrity contributes to a decline in elevation, over the course of a few months to a few years, below the lower limit for emergent plant growth and natural recovery. We further posit that coastal wetland peat collapse is driven by severe stress or death of the vegetation, which compromises the supportive structure roots provide to low-density organic soils and shifts the carbon balance of the ecosystem toward a net source, as mineralization is no longer offset by sequestration. Under these conditions, four mechanisms may contribute to peat collapse: (1) compression of gas-filled pore spaces within the soil during dry-down conditions; (2) deconsolidation of excessively waterlogged peat, followed by transport; (3) compaction of aerenchyma tissue in wetland plant roots, and possibly collapse of root channels; and (4) acceleration of soil mineralization due to the addition of labile carbon (dying roots), oxygen (decreased flooding), nutrients (eutrophication), or sulfate (saltwater intrusion). Scientists and land managers should focus efforts on monitoring vegetation health across the coastal landscape as an indicator for peat collapse vulnerability and move toward codifying the term "peat collapse" in the scientific literature. Once clarified, the contribution of peat collapse to coastal wetland loss can be evaluated.

AB Edge effects of native forest fragmentation have been well studied, but there are few studies of open-ground habitats fragmented by plantation forests. We measure forestry edge effects on open-ground breeding birds, following one of Europe's biggest and most controversial land-use transformations. The Flow Country' of northern Scotland is one of the world's greatest expanses of blanket bog. It became fragmented by conifer forests planted in the late 20th century, and these now adjoin open peatlands protected under European conservation legislation. Detrimental edge effects on breeding birds were anticipated, but not apparent shortly after planting. Using survey data collected in 2003-2006, and logistic regression modelling, we tested whether breeding distributions of three wader species of international conservation concern, dunlin, European golden plover and common greenshank, were influenced by distance to forest edge, controlling for habitat and topography. All three species were more likely to occupy flatter, more exposed ground close to bog pools and were influenced by peatland vegetation structure. There was an additive and adverse effect of proximity to forest edge for dunlin and European golden plover, but not common greenshank. This effect was strongest within 700m of forest edges. We used these results to predict which areas should benefit most from removal of adjacent forestry and so guide maintenance and restoration of the bird interests of the protected areas.Synthesis and applications. Edge effects of mature forestry on dunlin and golden plover are apparent over several hundred metres and are now being used to guide forest planning in northern Scotland. The scale of edge effect is broadly consistent with other avian studies in open-ground habitats across Eurasia and North America, so buffer zones of this order are consistent with possible impacts of plantation forestry on open-ground habitats of bird conservation interest. Given renewed interest in conifer afforestation as a climate change mitigation measure, an improved understanding of edge effects and the mechanisms through which they operate is vital to managing plantation forestry in ways that maintain open-ground landscapes of high conservation value.

AB Extensive Westphalian D to Stephanian coal seams divide the Sydney Mines Formation of Cape Breton Island into large-scale repetitive sedimentary packages. The Backpit seam, one of the most continuous seams within this formation, was studied in detail to establish compositional trends and relate these to paleomire development within an overall transgressive setting. The seam is of high-volatile B to A bituminous rank and ranges in thickness from 0.6 to 1.5 m onshore. Agglutinated foraminifera occur in strata directly below and above the seam, indicating a coastal setting for the mire. Ash and sulphur contents average 15.3 +/- 6 and 5.2 +/- 2 %, respectively. Sulphur, predominantly in the form of pyrite, increases near the roof of the seam, consistent with a brackish influence in the roof strata.
   The planar Backpit mire was subjected to widespread, periodic flooding, marked by thin dull to coaly shale lithotype intervals. Some intervals can be correlated across the onshore portion of the basin for more than 45 km and this distribution suggests regional controls on their formation. Seam lithology changes frequently in vertical section and banded lithotypes predominate. Vitrinite macerals and vitrinite-rich microlithotypes are abundant and thin discrete fusain bands, the remains of ancient fires, are also common. Coal facies patterns record a series of wetting upward pulses in the upper portion of the seam that culminated in the drowning and termination of the mire. A broad, relatively shallow embayment subsequently formed that supported a fresh- to brackish water fauna.

AB We measured soil climate and the turbulent fluxes of CO2, H2O, heat, and momentum on short towers (2 m) in a 160-yr-old boreal black spruce forest in Manitoba, Canada. Two distinct land cover types were studied: a Sphagnum-dominated wetland, and a feathermoss (Pleurozium and Hylocomium)-dominated upland, both lying within the footprint of a 30-m tower, which has measured whole-forest carbon exchange since 1994. Peak summertime uptake of CO2 was higher in the wetland than for the forest as a whole due to the influence of deciduous shrubs. Soil respiration rates in the wetland were approximately three times larger than in upland soils, and 30% greater than the mean of the whole forest, reflecting decomposition of soil organic matter. Soil respiration rates in the wetland were regulated by soil temperature, which was in turn influenced by water table depth through effects on soil heat capacity and conductivity. Warmer soil temperatures and deeper water tables favored increased heterotrophic respiration. Wetland drainage was limited by frost during the first half of the growing season, leading to high, perched water tables, cool soil temperatures, and much lower respiration rates than observed later in the growing season. Whole-forest evapotranspiration increased as water tables dropped, suggesting that photosynthesis in this forest was rarely subject to water stress. Our data indicate positive feedback between soil temperature, seasonal thawing, heterotrophic respiration, and evapotranspiration. As a result, climate warming could cause covariant changes in soil temperature and water table depths that may stimulate photosynthesis and strongly promote efflux of CO2 from peat soils in boreal wetlands.

AB We studied how fluctuating asymmetry (FA), which is commonly used as an non-specific stress indicator, is influenced by abiotic stress along a moisture gradient and by rapid growth, i.e. the production of larger than normal leaves after simulated browsing, in white birch (Betula pubescens) growing in a mire. Variation of abiotic stress (plots near vs far from open, wet boundary of tree stand) was obvious as interpreted from smaller leaf size and lower stature of trees growing closest to the wettest, open center of the mire. However. we did not find increased leaf FA near the wettest area, possibly because of the high background level of stress in the mire habitat or the presence of flood-tolerant genotypes.
   Simulated winter browsing increased leaf size in the following growing season, and the strength of the response increased with the severity of the browsing treatment. Likewise, larger leaves of browsed ramets had higher developmental instability, as measured by size-corrected FA. Moreover, the effects of simulated winter browsing on FA were proportionally greater than the size effects in expanding leaves. Simulated winter browsing also increased insect damage incurred by leaves.
   Our results demonstrate that, in addition to previously shown effects of stress, excess leaf growth can also increase developmental instability and FA. We also demonstrated a higher rate of developmental errors in the later than early stages of leaf expansion.

AB High-resolution peat humification records were obtained from Dajiuhu of the Shennongjia Mountains and Qianmutian of the Tianmu Mountains to study climate changes in East China. The analyses of pollen, organic matters, TOC, and Rb/Sr indicate a high degree of peat humification and thus strong decomposition of organic matter when climate was dry. Conversely, when climate was humid, the degree of humification is low because peat was preserved in a waterlogged condition. Peat humification from Dajiuhu occurred not only during the Younger Dryas (about 11.4-12.6 cal ka BP), the Bolling-Allerod Warm Period (12.6-15.2 cal ka BP), and the Oldest Dryas (about 15.2-16.0 cal ka BP), but also during the early Holocene (about 11.4-9.4 cal ka BP), the 8.2 cal ka BP cold event, and the Holocene Optimum (about 7.0-4.2 cal ka BP). Both peat humification records since nearly 5 ka BP are consistent, showing that mountain peatland has synchronous responses to the East Asia monsoon-induced precipitation. The LOI data confirm the above observation. The monsoon precipitation since nearly 5 ka BP recorded in these two peat profiles can be divided into three phases. During 4.9-3.5 ka BP, precipitation amount was high but fluctuated greatly. During 3.5-0.9 ka BP, precipitation amount was low. During 0.9-0 ka BP, degree of humification reduced gradually, indicating the increase of monsoon precipitation. Contrast to other high-resolution records from East China monsoon region shows that the monsoon precipitation records of the two peat profiles since nearly 16 ka BP are controlled by a common forcing mechanism of summer solar radicalization in the Northern Hemisphere.

AB There is concern that changes in climate and land use could increase rates of decomposition in peatlands, leading to release of stored C to the atmosphere. Rates of decomposition are driven by abiotic factors such as temperature and moisture, but also by biotic factors such as changes in litter quality resulting from vegetation change. While effects of litter species identity and diversity on decomposition processes are well studied, the impact of changes in relative abundance (evenness) of species has received less attention. In this study we investigated effects of changes in short-term peatland plant species evenness on decomposition in mixed litter assemblages, measured as litter weight loss, respired CO2 and leachate C and N. We found that over the 307-day incubation period, higher levels of species evenness increased rates of decomposition in mixed litters, measured as weight loss and leachate dissolved organic N. We also found that the identity of the dominant species influenced rates of decomposition, measured as weight loss, CO2 flux and leachate N. Greatest rates of decomposition were when the dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris dominated litter mixtures, and lowest rates when the bryophyte Pleurozium schreberi dominated. Interactions between evenness and dominant species identity were also detected for litter weight loss and leachate N. In addition, positive non-additive effects of mixing litter were observed for litter weight loss. Our findings highlight the importance of changes in the evenness of plant community composition for short-term decomposition processes in UK peatlands.

AB Vegetation patterns across the Florida Everglades peatland are influenced by anthropogenic gradients in both hydrology and chemistry. These gradients often overlap, making it difficult to isolate specific causes of vegetation change. We examined whether differences in plant communities between the minimally impacted interior and the impacted perimeter of the northern Everglades could be attributed to soil chemistry as opposed to other factors such as hydrology or seed-bank composition. Seedling establishment from soil seed banks collected from interior locations was examined under conditions that reflected either the phosphorus (P)- and calcium-carbonate (CaCO3)-depleted chemistry of the peatland interior or enriched conditions around the perimeter. Three soil moisture treatments were used to increase seed-bank expression. The interior seed bank contained viable seeds of both interior and perimeter taxa, but distinct plant assemblages established in the two chemistry treatments. Perimeter species germinated in both chemistry treatments, but only survived under enriched conditions. Establishment of these species in the interior is likely limited by low P availability. Germination and survival of some interior species were reduced by enrichment, likely due to elevated CaCO3 levels. Protection from both increased P and CaCO3 loads thus appears important to maintain plant communities in mineral-poor remnants of the Everglades.

AB The peach x almond hybrid GF677 was inoculated in three different substrates: sandy soil, peat and a commercial peat-bark compost mix, immediately after the weaning stage. After 3 months of growth under greenhouse conditions, plants were transplanted in a microplot set-up. At transplanting, differences in growth and in mycorrhizal colonisation were significantly related to the starter substrate used; plants grown in peat were taller than plants grown in soil or in the compost-peat mix. Although both soil-less growing media were less conducive than soil to AM colonisation, the compost-pear mix resulted in higher colonisation percentages. At the end of the first growing season, there were significant interactions between starter substrate and inoculation treatments affecting plant growth. After two growing seasons, the level of AM root colonisation was similar for all inoculated plants, and all plants presenting the symbiosis were bigger than those that had not been inoculated, irrespective of the substrate used in the nursery.

AB This article presents a mid-resolution elemental, isotopic and charcoal record from 10700 BC to AD 500 in a peat core located in Zyglin (southern Poland). The objective is to give insight into the proxies with emphasis on lead (Pb) sources in this minerogenic peat deposit. During the Early Holocene (10700-7550 BC) the average Pb-206/Pb-207 quotient was around 1.196. This isotopic signature is consistent with natural dust derived from long-distance soil and rock weathering. The Mid-Holocene period (7550-3200 BC) shows a significant change in the peat accumulation conditions. The growth rate is approximately 0.04 mm yr-1 and the Pb-206/Pb-207 quotients are shifted toward values that are found in local galena ores. This is simultaneous with a significantly increased lead flux which further confirms local sources of material in this peat deposit. In the Late Holocene period (3200 BC-AD 500) a large quantity of charcoal particles with diameters ranging from 2 mm up to 3 cm is found; also, Pb, Zn and Cu fluxes reach their highest values. This period corresponds to the Eneolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages, and human impact is recorded as charcoal.

AB Permafrost melting is occurring in areas of the boreal forest region where large amounts of carbon ( C) are stored in organic soils. We measured soil respiration, net CO2 flux, and net CH4 flux during May - September 2003 and March 2004 in a black spruce lowland in interior Alaska to better understand how permafrost thaw in poorly drained landscapes affects land-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange. Sites included peat soils underlain by permafrost at similar to 0.4 m depth ( permafrost plateau, PP), four thermokarst wetlands ( TW) having no permafrost in the upper 2.2 m, and peat soils bordering the thermokarst wetlands having permafrost at similar to 0.5 m depth ( thermokarst edges, TE). Soil respiration rates were not significantly different among the sites, and 5-cm soil temperature explained 50 - 91% of the seasonal variability in soil respiration within the sites. Groundcover vegetation photosynthesis ( calculated as net CO2 minus soil respiration) was significantly different among the sites ( TW > TE > PP), which can be partly attributed to the difference in photosynthetically active radiation reaching the ground at each site type. Methane emission rates were 15 to 28 times greater from TW than from TE and PP. We modeled annual soil respiration and groundcover vegetation photosynthesis using soil temperature and radiation data, and CH4 flux by linear interpolation. We estimated all sites as net C gas sources to the atmosphere ( not including tree CO2 uptake at PP and TE), although the ranges in estimates when accounting for errors were large enough that TE and TW may have been net C sinks.

AB Complete porewater profiles from two peat bogs in the Jura Mountains were analysed for major and trace inorganic anions and cations. At La Tourbiere des Genevez (TGe) and Etang de la Gruere (EGr), peat formation began approximately 5,000 and 10,000 years BP, respectively. The maximum depths of peat accumulation are 140 cm (TGe) and 650 cm (EGr); previous geochemical studies showed that the ombrogenic sections of the bogs extend to depths of approximately 20 cm (TGe) and 250 cm (EGr). Water samples were obtained in situ diffusion equilibrium samplers (peepers), which allow filtered (0.2 mu m) porewaters to be obtained while preventing degassing and oxidation. These samplers were found to be well suited to bog porewaters and allowed volatile (dissolved CO2, acetate) and redox-sensitive species (HS-, Fe2+) to be quantified without further sample preparation or treatment. Aqueous species concentrations were determined immediately afterwards using ion chromatography with either conductivity (acetate, HCO3-, Cl-, Br-, NO3-, HPO42-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+), amperometry (HS-), or absorbance detection (Fe(III) and Fe(II)). The comprehensive analyses of anions and cations allowed humic substances to be calculated by the difference in electrical charge balance (i.e., the anion deficit).
   Concentrations of total dissolved CO2 (2-12 mM) showed that carbonate equilibria play a significant role in the acid-base chemistry throughout the profiles. In near surface, ombrogenic porewaters with pH around 4, however, protons (approx. 160 mu eq/L) are contributed mainly by the dissociation of humic substances (2-7 mM DOC). In the deepest, minerogenic layers H2CO3 is the predominant acid at both sites. At these depths, carbonate alkalinity (up to 3 meq/L at EGr, up to 8 meq/L at TGe) arises from reaction of the pore fluids with mineral matter in the underlying sediments. In the transition zone between the ombrogenic and minerogenic extremes, organic and inorganic acids are equal in importance.
   Unidentified organic S species accounted for 90-99% of total dissolved sulfur (S-T) in the porewaters at TGe, with SO42- and HS- the dominant inorganic species; S species with intermediate oxidation states such as SO32- and S2OS32- were always less than the detection limit of approximately 0.4 mu M. At TGe the sulfate concentrations exceeded those of sulfide, with 1.25 and 0.25 mu M, respectively, being typical. At EGr, S-T and SO42- were comparable to the waters at TGe, but HS- at EGr was always less than the detection limit of 0.15 mu M At both sites dissimilatory sulfate reduction is limited by the low concentrations of sulfate supplied to the bog surfaces (i.e., atmospheric deposition only), and the uptake of sulfate and its conversion to organic S compounds by the living plants.
   Despite the anoxic condition of the waters, the ratio of Fe(III)(T) to Fe(II)(T) was always high: at EGr this ratio was generally 1:1, and even in the sulfidic waters at TGe the ratio was 1:3. PHREEQE was used to calculate the effect of complex-forming organic ligands on {Fe3+} and {Fe2+} in these porewaters. The relatively high ratios of Fe(III)(T) compared to Fe(II)(T) can be explained in terms of the much greater thermodynamic stability of the organic complexes of Fe3+ compared to those of Fe2+.

AB Organic matter in the terrestrial biosphere has a fundamental role in moderating the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the biosphere. One important property of organic matter is its oxidative ratio (OR); that is, the ratio of moles O-2 released per mole CO2 sequestered through photosynthesis, that is, the lower the OR, less O-2 is released per mole of CO2 fixed. In global assessments of CO2 partitioning, the failure to account for changes in OR could lead to an underestimate of terrestrial carbon sequestration. It is known that OR can vary between environments and management, but what other factors could be playing a role in controlling OR? This study measured the OR of a range of peat (Histosols) and mineral soils (Inceptisols) under similar management from across the United Kingdom to investigate how OR varies within and between material types. The study shows that OR values varied significantly between material types (median peat OR=1.10, median vegetation OR=1.03 and median mineral soil OR=1.14), and they also varied between study sites. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in OR with peat depth. Given the results from this study, we can suggest that future sampling strategies should include sampling of the major carbon pools (i.e. vegetation, litter and soil) and that, as a first approximation, OR can be examined on the basis of these carbon pools alone. The values measured in the study give a new residence time-weighted global OR estimate for the terrestrial biosphere (<mml:msubsup>ORterraglobal</mml:msubsup>) of 1.056 +/- 0.02.

AB In a carbon-constrained world, global peatlands are vital carbon capture and storage systems. Here we calculate regional carbon stocks, sequestration rates and potential carbon emissions of Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) found in low order headwater streams in eastern Australia. We find that total carbon stocks within THPSS in two regions are 25 Mt CO2 eq. with annual carbon sequestration rates at 60.5 kt CO2 eq. A risk assessment model, based on anthropogenic activities known to impair the carbon storage functions of THPSS is used to identify swamps most at risk of carbon loss. Potential CO2 emissions from at risk swamps could be up to 8.6 Mt CO2 eq. When carbon stock is valued at the current carbon abatement price of $AUD16.10 t(-1) CO2 eq, the total value of THPSS is over AUD$404 million dollars (US$281 million). This makes a strong economic case for the implementation of sustainable swamp conservation and restoration activities. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sphagnum peat (peat), spruce bark compost (compost), peat + perlite (1 : 1, v : v) and compost + perlite (1 : 1, v : v) substrates were inoculated with vegetative alginate-bead inoculum of Hebeloma crustuliniforme, Hygrophorus agathosmus or Paxillus involutus or left uninoculated prior to the addition of Norway spruce seed. Growth and percentage of mycorrhization of bareroot seedlings cultivated in a greenhouse were evaluated after the first growing season. Seedlings grown in peat-based substrates had significantly larger aboveground and total dry weight, but significantly lower mycorrhization percentage than those grown in compost-based substrates. There were no significant differences between fungal treatments (including control) for both the percentage of mycorrhization and growth of seedlings. The artificially introduced fungi were not efficient in mycorrhizal formation - naturally occurring fungi were common in all treatments. However, a significant interaction between substrate and fungus treatments in root dry weight was detected. Hebeloma - inoculated seedlings grown in peat showed the highest value of root dry weight. This fact indicates other possible effects of the fungi on root growth independent of mycorrhization. Growth parameters were negatively correlated with the extent of mycorrhization, indicating allocation of host photosynthates to the fungi. To the best of our knowledge, operational inoculation of Norway spruce seedlings with the test fungi has not been reported previously.

AB Plant communities play a key role in regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in peatland ecosystems and therefore in their ability to act as carbon (C) sinks. However, in response to global change, a shift from Sphagnum-dominated to vascular-plant-dominated peatlands may occur, with a potential alteration in their C-sink function. To investigate how the main GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) are affected by a plant community change (shift from dominance of Sphagnum mosses to vascular plants, i.e., Molinia caerulea), a mesocosm experiment was set up. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and CH4 emission models were used to estimate the annual C balance and global warming potential under both vegetation covers. While the ER and CH4 emission models estimated an output of, respectively, 376 +/- 108 and 7 +/- 4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum mesocosms, this reached 1018 +/- 362 and 33 +/- 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in mesocosms with Sphagnum rubellum and Molinia caerulea. Annual modeled GPP was estimated at -414 +/- 122 and -1273 +/- 482 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum and Sphagnum + Molinia plots, respectively, leading to an annual CO2 and CH4 budget of -30 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum plots and of -223 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum + Molinia ones (i.e., a C sink). Even if CH4 emissions accounted for a small part of the gaseous C efflux (ca. 3 %), their global warming potential value makes both plant communities have a climate warming effect. The shift of vegetation from Sphagnum mosses to Molinia caerulea seems beneficial for C sequestration at a gaseous level. However, roots and litter of Molinia caerulea could provide substrates for C emissions that were not taken into account in the short measurement period studied here.

AB Episodic flooding due to intense rainfall events is characteristic in many wetlands, which may modify wetland-atmosphere exchange of CO2. However, the degree to which episodic flooding affects net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) is poorly documented in supratidal wetlands of coastal zone, where rainfall-driven episodic flooding often occurs. To address this issue, the ecosystem CO2 fluxes were continuously measured using the eddy covariance technique for 4 years (2010-2013) in a supratidal wetland in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that over the growing season, the daily average uptake in the supratidal wetland was -1.4, -1.3, -1.0, and -1.3 g Cm-2 d(-1) for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. On the annual scale, the supratidal wetland functioned as a strong sink for atmospheric CO2, with the annual NEE of -223, -164, and -247 g Cm-2 yr(-1) for 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. The mean diurnal pattern of NEE exhibited a smaller range of variation before episodic flooding than after it. Episodic flooding reduced the average daytime net CO2 uptake and the maximum rates of photosynthesis. In addition, flooding clearly suppressed the nighttime CO2 release from the wetland but increased its temperature sensitivity. Therefore, effects of episodic flooding on the direction and magnitude of NEE should be considered when predicting the ecosystem responses to future climate change in supratidal wetlands.

DE Carbon dioxide; MODIS fPAR; MODIS NDVI; Molinia caerulea; phenology;

AB In peatlands plant growth and senescence affect annual ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, and CO2 fluxes show considerable inter-annual variability. Phenology is a fundamental indicator of ecosystem carbon dynamics and can be measured from remote sensing systems, but the extent to which satellite products provide useful proxies of peatland vegetation phenology is not well known. Using MODIS vegetation products coupled with field observations of phenology from a basic camera system and measurements of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) measured using a closed chamber method, we sought to establish the extent to which satellite observations capture phenological processes at a UK peatland site. Daily, true-colour digital images were captured with a time-lapse camera (Brinno TLC100) between 23-Apr-2013 and 29-Oct-2013 and converted into a Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI). These were compared with a range of MODIS vegetation products at various spatial resolutions. We found that vegetation products with finer spatial resolution (<500m) more accurately captured spring green-up (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 16-day product), whereas those with 8-day temporal resolution better captured whole-season dynamics. The 8-day Gross Primary Productivity (GPP8) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR8) products had the strongest daily Pearson's correlations with camera-derived GRVI (r>0.90). The camera-GRVI (P=0.005, r=0.98) and MODIS-GRVI (P=0.041, r=0.89) products showed the strongest significant correlations with gross primary productivity measured using static chambers in the field. This work demonstrates that freely available MODIS data captured up to 92% of the daily variation in phenology over an upland peatland. This approach shows great potential for capturing ecosystem carbon dynamics which underpin carbon trading schemes, a budding funding source for peatland restoration projects.

AB Biological clogging of unsaturated soils is an important process that can lead to the development of a biomat and failure of biofilters used to treat various wastewater streams. Septic beds and peat filters used to treat septic tank effluent are important applications. Several conceptual models have been developed to simulate clogging in saturated soils; however, limited effort has been conducted to develop similar models for unsaturated soils. Different conceptual models have been proposed to simulate biological clogging in unsaturated systems. These models include the impacts of biomass growth on the relative permeability term for unsaturated flow, but limited experimental data have been used to validate these models. In this study, column experiments were conducted to study the clogging process in loose and dense peat, filter media sand, and septic bed sand. Experimental data indicated that the pore structure of the peat, in comparison to two commonly used sands for septic drainage fields, allowed the biomass to distribute itself over a greater depth within the peat biofilter and delayed the formation of a biomat at the surface and eventual clogging of the filter medium.

AB Since the 1950s, a significant decrease in the population numbers of Salix lapponum L. has been observed in Poland, particularly in the Polesie Lubelskie region. One of the most important threats comes from the biotic environment including interactions at the trophic level. An unidentified issue was the occurrence and importance of phytophagous insects inhabiting S. lapponum in terms of real threats to growth and development as well as specific plant reactions to herbivores. The aim of the study was to recognize the occurrence of phytophagous insects inhabiting S. lapponum, i.e. an endangered species, and estimation of physiological changes caused by the herbivorous species feeding.
   The field study was conducted in a locality of S. lapponum population in the peat bog near Bikcze Lake (Polesie Lubelskie Region) in 2014-2015. In each growing season from the end of April to September, 100 stems of S. lapponum shoots with similar length were examined once a month. Selected parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured and the accumulation of H2O2 was visually detected in leaves collected from the control plants and from those attacked by herbivores using the 3',3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) method. We found the presence of 8 phytophagous insect species from 4 orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and Lepidoptera) on S. lapponum. Most of the shoots were inhabited by Lochmea caprea, Aphrophora salicina and Aphis farinosa. On the basis of the measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence and H2O2 accumulation under phytophagous insects feeding, we have demonstrated that S. lapponum was able to maintain photosynthesis under insect attack and that the accumulation of H2O2 in leaf blades indicates local rather than systemic stress response to herbivore feeding.
   Phytophagous insects feeding caused relatively weak disruptions to host plant physiology and S. lapponum is able to maintain photosynthetic efficiency under insect attack. Variation in plant traits influence host plant selection and performance of herbivorous insects. Comparative studies are needed to assess the species composition and population numbers of insects occurring on plants from other S. lapponum populations. Detailed knowledge of the biotic factors affecting the occurrence of S. lapponum would facilitate establishment of the form of its conservation.

AB The ability to carry out systematic, accurate and repeatable vegetation surveys is an essential part of long-term scientific studies into ecosystem biodiversity and functioning. However, current widely used traditional survey techniques such as destructive harvests, pin frame quadrats and visual cover estimates can be very time consuming and are prone to subjective variations. We investigated the use of digital image techniques as an alternative way of recording vegetation cover to plant functional type level on a peatland ecosystem. Using an established plant manipulation experimental site at Moor House NNR (an Environmental Change Network site), we compared visual cover estimates of peatland vegetation with cover estimates using digital image classification methods, from 0.5 m x 0.5 m field plots. Our results show that digital image classification of photographs taken with a standard digital camera can be used successfully to estimate dwarf-shrub and graminoid vegetation cover at a comparable level to field visual cover estimates, although the methods were less effective for lower plants such as mosses and lichens. Our study illustrates the novel application of digital image techniques to provide a new way of measuring and monitoring peatland vegetation to the plant functional group level, which is less vulnerable to surveyor bias than are visual field surveys. Furthermore, as such digital techniques are highly repeatable, we suggest that they have potential for use in long-term monitoring studies, at both plot and landscape scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI CO2 Emission Factors for Coals
SO KEMIJA U INDUSTRIJI-JOURNAL OF CHEMISTS AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERS

DT Article
DE CO2 emission factor; Greenhouse IPCC methodology; coal; peat
ID CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; RANK; COMBUSTION
AB Emission factors are used in greenhouse gas inventories to estimate emissions from coal combustion. In the absence of direct measures, emissions factors are frequently used as a quick, low cost way to estimate emissions values. Coal combustion has been a major contributor to the CO2 flux into the atmosphere. Nearly all of the fuel carbon (99 %) in coal is converted to CO2 during the combustion process. The carbon content is the most important coal parameter which is the measure of the degree of coalification (coal rank). Coalification is the alteration of vegetation to form peat, succeeded by the transformation of peat through lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous to anthracite coal. During the geochemical or metamorphic stage, the progressive changes that occur within the coal are an increase in the carbon content and a decrease in the hydrogen and oxygen content resulting in a loss of volatiles. Heterogeneous composition of coal causes variation in CO2 emission from different coals.
   The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has produced guidelines on how to produce emission inventories which includes emission factors. Although 2006 IPCC Guidelines provided the default values specified according to the rank of the coal, the application of country-specific emission factors was recommended when estimating the national greenhouse gas emissions. This paper discusses the differences between country-specific emission factors and default IPCC CO2 emission factors, EF(CO2), for coals. Also, this study estimated EF(CO2) for two different types of coals and peat from B&H, on the basis fuel analyses.
   Carbon emission factors for coal mainly depend on the carbon content of the fuel and vary with both rank and geographic origin, which supports the idea of provincial variation of carbon emission factors. Also, various other factors, such as content of sulphur, minerals and macerals play an important role and influence EF(CO2) from coal. Carbonate minerals (calcite and siderite) directly contribute CO2 when they decompose during coal combustion. Variations in the maceral content can also influence CO2 emissions; high inertinite contents increase CO2 emissions. Sulphur in coal reduces EF(CO2).
   Fuel analysis is very important when estimating greenhouse gas emissions and emission factors. In this preliminary study, based on the results of the fuel analysis, CO2 emission factors for coals and peat from Livno, B&H have been calculated. EF(CO2) is defined as the amount of carbon dioxide emission per unit net calorific values of the fuel. Net calorific value (the lower heating value) corresponds to the heat produced by combustion where total water in the combustion products exists as water vapour.
   The EF(CO2) obtained for sub-bituminous coal, lignite and peat were: 98.7, 109.5, and 147.9 t TJ(-1), respectively, which correspond to the following net calorific values: 20.6, 11.5 and 3.6 MJ kg(-1). The heating value is generally known to increase with the increase in carbon content (this parameter is connected with the degree of coalification, coal age). The other indispensable parameters are hydrogen, which has a positive effect on the net calorific value, and oxygen and water which impact the net calorific value negatively. The differences in net calorific values can be explained in part by the difference of total moisture content among the different fuel types.
   The CO2 emission factors calculated in this study were compared with those of IPCC. A significant difference was observed for peat (39.5 %), followed by lignite (8.2 %) and sub-bituminous coal (4.3 %).

AB Cultivated organic soils are a remarkable source of greenhouse gases (GHG) in many countries. Keeping the ground water table as high as possible could lower the mineralization rate of the peat and thus the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from these soils. We studied the effect of raised water table on the emissions of N2O, CO2 and methane (CH4) from undisturbed peat soil profiles of six different Finnish cultivated organic soils during a 5-week outdoor mesocosm experiment. The aim was to determine an optimum water table that would enable grass cultivation but lower the net gas balance of the soil. Raised water table decreased the GHG emissions from each peat type ranging from weakly decomposed Sphagnum peat to highly humified Carex peat. Based on the results, the optimum water table would be 30 cm below the soil surface. The average reduction of the total net emissions with a raise of water table from a typical drainage depth of 70 to 30 cm was 42 % in the outdoors mesocosm experiment and 23 % at a constant temperature (+6 A degrees C). The emissions of both CO2 and N2O declined and the net consumption of CH4 changed to net production as the water table rose. The results were confirmed by long-term measurements at one of the sampled sites. As a conclusion, we see that promoting drainage systems enabling raising of the ground water table and cultivation of crops capable of producing good yields also in wet conditions would be beneficial for the GHG mitigation in agriculture.

AB Litter samples from peat podzolic (Stagnic Podzoluvisol) and soddy gley (Mollic Gleysol) soils differing in their chemical and physicochemical properties, geochemical conditions, and the character of soil microbial complexes were analyzed. The sampling was performed three times during the growing season: in May, August, and October. The contents of ammonium ions, soluble phenolic compounds, and flavans were determined in all the samples. The litters of the two soils differed in the contents of both ammonium ions and phenolic compounds. Distinct seasonal dynamics of ammonium and phenolic compounds were registered in the litter of the peat podzolic soil. The high negative correlation between the contents of ammonium ions and phenolic compounds was found for the samples collected in May.

ID CARBONATE PRECIPITATION
AB Peat soil is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation, formed under the condition of nearly permanent water saturation, which makes the high moisture and compressibility as two main features of peat. In recent years, the lack of construction lands diverts researchers' attention to make use of marginal grounds, like peatland, after some improvements. The past decade has witnessed a growing interest in microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) due to its reliability, broad application, and potential contribution to sustainable and green development. This study has two primary aims: (i) investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of MICP in peat soil combined with bamboo fiber reinforcement, and (ii) ascertaining the mechanism of bamboo fiber incorporated MICP. Bamboo fiber possesses some unparalleled advantages owing to its fast growth and ability to survive in diverse climates. This study differs from previous researches in the use of native bacteria isolated from the peat soil, while most of them were conducted using exogenous bacteria, which might pose a threat regarding adaption and microbial pollution. Different concentrations of cementation resources (1-3 mol/L) and proportion of fibers (0-50%) were studied, and each case was well designed. Treated samples were subjected to the fall cone test to estimate the undrained shear strength at certain time intervals. The results revealed that samples with higher fiber content gained higher strength than others did, whereas high initial cementation resources in soil could reduce strength. Microscale observations were also performed on treated samples to clarify the mechanism of MICP incorporated with fiber.

AB Four palynomorph assemblages, whose parent plants contributed to the formation of the lignite, occur in the lignite seams and associated sediments from the Manning Formation (Jackson Group) outcrop in the Lake Somerville spillway of Texas. The Cicatricosisporites-Laevigatosporites fern assemblage occurs in the middle and upper seam and probably derived from a freshwater herbaceous mire community. The Momipites coryloides-Arecipites columellus-Liliacidites assemblage occurs in all three seams and probably derived from a freshwater mire forest with an open canopy or shrub community. The Momipites coryloides-Nyssa-Rhoipites angustus assemblage occurs in the lower and middle seams and probably derived from a different freshwater mire forest. The Cupuliferoipollenites-Cupuliferoidaepollenites liblarensis-Siltaria cf. S. scabriextima assemblage occurs at the top of the lower and middle seams, which are overlain by marine sediments. The association between Cupuliferoipollenites dominance and the presence of marine diatoms and brackish or marine trace fossils in the lignite suggests that this assemblage may have derived from a mangrove (i.e. marine or brackish) mire forest. However, other factors may influence its distribution. Ailanthipites berryi, possibly derived from a tree or shrub related to the 'tree of heaven', predominates in the claystone underlying the lower lignite seam and may have colonized the coastal plain prior to the initiation of peat accumulation. We can differentiate lignite samples dominated by fern spores, Momipites pollen and Cupuliferoipollenites pollen based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) fragmentograms of triterpanes (m/z 191) and steranes (m/z 217), The lignite layers dominated by each palynomorph assemblage appear to have distinct sources and different early diagenetic (pre-coalification) histories.

However, research has been mainly focused on using biocontainers in short-term greenhouse production of bedding plants, with limited research investigating the use of biocontainers in long-term nursery production of woody crops. This project investigated the feasibility of using biocontainers in a pot-in-pot (PIP) nursery production system. Two paper (also referred as wood pulp) biocontainers were evaluated in comparison with a plastic container in a PIP system for 2 years at four locations (Holt, MI; Lexington, KY; Crystal Springs, MS; El Paso, TX). One-year-old river birch (Betula nigra) liners were used in this study. Results showed that biocontaiuners stayed intact at the end of the first growing season, but were penetrated to different degrees after the second growing season depending on the vigor of root growth at a given location and pot type. Plants showed different growth rates at different locations. However, at a given location, there were no differences in plant growth index (PGI) or plant biomass among plants grown in different container types. Daily water use (DWU) was not influenced by container type. Results suggest that both biocontainers tested have the potential to be alternatives to plastic containers for short-term (1 year) birch production in the PIP system. However, they may not be suitable for long-term (more than 1 year) PIP production due to root penetration at the end of the second growing season.

AB Peatlands are unique ecological communities that represent long-term terrestrial carbon sinks with enormous organic substance supply. Soil organic substance represents the main source of organic carbon in the biosphere, and depending of conditions, it is able to eliminate or sequestrate greenhouse gasses in the environment. Current methods of peatbogs assessment rely on the use of ecological indicators, but often lack an in-depth analysis of soil parameters. The objective of this study was to examine vertical profiles of selected soil properties (soil reaction, soil organic carbon content, soil moisture) and various types of microbial activity (soil basal respiration, microbial biomass carbon, activity of soil urease, phosphatases and catalase). Soil samples were collected from three sites (centre of peatbog, edge of peatbog and site closely surrounding peatbog) on the peat soil at three depth intervals (0-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m and 0.20-0.30 m) in northeast of Slovakia. Enzyme and microbial activities decreased with depth, but significant correlation was found with alkaline phosphatase. Average values of most soil biochemical indices were highest at the centre of peatbog with the exception of urease and catalase activity. Our results indicated that enzymatic and biological potential for organic matter mineralization was strongly correlated to soil pH, soil moisture and soil organic matter content.

AB During the growing season of 1989 and 1990 denitrification measurements were carried out in grazed perennial rye-grass swards on sand, loam and peat soils, each receiving two rates of nitrogen fertilizer. Denitrification was measured monthly, using a coring system with acetylene inhibition. Denitrification rates were highly variable throughout the season but tended to increase with increasing soil water content. High denitrification rates (0.1 kg N ha(-1) day(-1)) were observed in spring and autumn, and were associated with rainfall or grazing in combination with a high soil water content. Estimated seasonal denitrification losses ranged between 1 and 21% of the fertilizer input, and showed no significant effect of fertilizer application rate. In 1990, denitrification losses were significantly higher on the loam soil. However, this difference was rather a result of different timing of sampling after rainfall or grazing, than of soil type differences. In the growing season of 1991, field experiments were carried out in the same sites, to measure denitrification losses during the first 8 or 10 days after fertilizer application. Fertilizer application significantly increased denitrification rates. Losses following one fertilizer application ranged from 6 to 9% of the fertilizer input, but only on a wet soil.

AB High-latitude region is sensitive to global climate change, and pollen record in sediments could reflect vegetation variation which responded to climate change. The Great Hinggan Mountains are main distribution areas of peatlands in high-latitude region in China and located at East Asian summer monsoonal margin, however, the variation of vegetation and climate in this region is still unclear. Based on the AMS C-14 dating, we analyzed the pollen assemblages to reconstruct vegetation history in Tuqiang (TQ) peatland, and we also used the principal component analysis to reconstruct the temperature and effective moisture and compared with other palaeoclimate records. Pollen assemblage denoted a coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest on the surrounding mountains, and peatland vegetation gradually evolved from herb community (Cyperaceae) to bush community (Ericaceae). The climate of north part in the Great Hinggan Mountains was mainly controlled by the East Asian Summer Monsoon which related to ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific. During the period from 3300 to 1150 cal yr BP, the dominant plant was Cyperaceae, with coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests bordered the peatland, which pointed to a relatively warm and wet climate. Between 1150 and 600 cal yr BP, the expansion of pine forests indicated a cool climate. The interval of 600-300 cal yr BP, the climate became cold and dry which related to the Little Ice Age. Since the 300 cal yr BP, Betula and Ericaceae dominated, the climate became warmer and drier. The obvious increase of secondary birch forests at the expense of pine forests may be the results of human disturbance, anthropogenic activities strengthened gradually and the variation of peatland vegetation was influenced mainly by anthropogenic activities rather than by climate since approximately 600 cal yr BP.

AB Surface mine operators in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of northeastern Alberta are required by regulation to mitigate habitat impacts resulting from their operations, including impacts to wetlands. To date, most land reclamation efforts have focused on recreating upland forestlands that resemble the surrounding natural (dry) boreal forest. However, the surficial conditions on these reclaimed upland sites can also promote spontaneous wetland development. At Suncor's Base Plant mine, opportunistic wetlands occurring on reclamation sites have not been formally included in the current inventory of reclaimed wetland areas and remain largely unquantified. We characterized and delineated an estimated 210 ha of opportunistic wetlands (consisting of shallow open water, marshes, and swamps) using aerial photo interpretation and remote sensing analysis in combination with follow-up field verifications. The remote-based (desktop) delineations consistently underestimated actual wetland extents, due mainly to underestimations in the extent of non-inundated vegetation zones (e.g., wet meadow) as well as shrubby swamp. After field corrections, opportunistic wetland habitat was estimated to constitute similar to 17% of the total study area (1209 ha), representing more than a fourfold increase in aerial wetland extent associated with reclaimed landforms over that delineated prior to this study. The interspersion of opportunistic wetlands with upland reclaimed landforms, although unintended, more closely reflects the pre-disturbance landscape, which was characterized by a matrix of forestlands, peatlands, and mineral wetlands (in contrast to the more peatland-dominated lowlands). At Suncor, wetland vegetation composition varied significantly across the study area and was influenced by topographic variation (e.g., in elevation and % slope) in combination with the reclamation substrates (soils) that were placed prior to seeding/planting. Thus, the inclusion of opportunistic wetland delineation in reclamation tracking and closure planning merits consideration as does the opportunity to manipulate current reclamation practices to promote the establishment and persistence of wetlands on reclaimed landforms.

AB The response of high arctic ecosystems' carbon dioxide exchange to changing climate is uncertain and may be important from a climate-change perspective. In this study, the net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange during four growing seasons is examined by combining measurements and modeling from a high arctic fen in northeastern Greenland. The summer-season net ecosystem exchange shows large interannual variations, fluctuating from an uptake of -50 g C m(-2) to -123 g C m(-2). Through ecosystem modeling, we can observe that leaf area index development and the maximum Rubisco capacity are more important controls on the interannual variability of net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange than meteorological conditions. Furthermore, we present a hypothesis linking the interannual variability in maximum Rubisco capacity with leaf nitrogen content and leaf area index development. This hypothesis may provide a method to model seasonal net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange in detail Without having to resort to elaborate fitting procedures using measured carbon dioxide flux data.

AB Boreal forest and tundra are the biomes expected to experience the greatest warming during the course of the next century. The transient responses of boreal peatlands to climate change could be more complex than a simple large release of carbon and rapid migrations of vegetation and permafrost. Here we used alternative models to demonstrate that local processes typical of permafrost peatlands control carbon and vegetation dynamics in ways that strongly mediate effects of regional temperature gradients. Regional temperature affected stability and thaw rate. Thaw rate increased with mean annual temperature, and rates have accelerated within the last 50 yr. Local factors exerted a strong; influence on stability, the levels of which were highest in three of the four temperature zones studied along the shaded south-southwest edges of collapse scars. The presence of Sphagnum fuscum cover increased stability. In all zones, survey points with S. fuscum showed more than twice the stability of points with feather moss, lichen, or no vegetation. In a direct model comparison between regional and local control, local factors were more important. Our results suggest that local processes mediate the effects of regional climate, and an accurate representation of ecosystem dynamics benefits from both local and regional processes.

AB Denitrification rates in the range of 359 to 599 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) were found in the waterlogged soil of a minerotrophic fen, Three different methods were used to estimate denitrification rates. The fen revealed a zone of enhanced denitrification and within this zone the spatial variation of denitrification rates Has elucidated using tno different approaches: microcosms and field observations. The denitrification rates in the microcosms were measured, either by. use of N-15-N-2 production rates (Method I) or by setting up a mass balance for nitrate (Method 2). Denitrification rates in the peat horizon at depths of 0 to 69 cm Here in the range 182 to 233 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) (Method 1) and 213 to 217 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) (Method 2). Denitrification rates measured in the deeper sandy soil horizons at depths of 69 to 156 cm were 46 to 103 mmoI N m(-2) d(-1) (Method I) and 33 to 137 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) (Method 2), Thus, both experiments revealed a strong and comparable decrease in denitrification rate with depth. which also corresponded Hell to soil carbon content. Denitrification rates were calculated from field data using Darcy's law and the conservation equation fur one-dimensional, steady state, advective transport of nitrate in In incompressible porous medium The same significant decrease in denitrification rates with depth nas observed as in the microcosm setup, The calculated denitrification rates were: 330 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) at depths of 0 to 75 cm (peat), 20 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) at depths of 75 to 115 cm (sandy soil), and 9 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) in the sandy soil horizon at depths of 155 to 205 cm. This study shows that detailed spatial information about pedological and hydrological parameters in combination with detailed spatial mapping and measurement of denitrification rates is fundamental for properly understanding nitrogen removal in waterlogged soils with ground Hater through-flow. Further, the results confirm that provided this information is present, it is possible to compare detailed laboratory experiments dth field studies of denitrification.

AB A lysimeter method using undisturbed soil columns was used to investigate the effect of water table depth and soil properties on soil organic matter decomposition and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cultivated peat soils. The study was carried out using cultivated organic soils from two locations in Sweden: Orke, a typical cultivated fen peat with low pH and high organic matter content and Majne-garden, a more uncommon fen peat type with high pH and low organic matter content. Even though carbon and nitrogen contents differ greatly between the sites, carbon and nitrogen density are quite similar. A drilling method with minimal soil disturbance was used to collect 12 undisturbed soil monoliths (50 cm high, 029.5 cm) per site. They were sown with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) after the original vegetation was removed. The lysimeter design allowed the introduction of water at depth so as to maintain a constant water table at either 40 cm or 80 cm below the soil surface. CO(2), CH(4) and N(2)O emissions from the lysimeters were measured weekly and complemented with incubation experiments with small undisturbed soil cores subjected to different tensions (5, 40. 80 and 600 cm water column). CO(2) emissions were greater from the treatment with the high water table level (40 cm) compared with the low level (80 cm). N(2)O emissions peaked in springtime and CH(4) emissions were very low or negative. Estimated GHG emissions during one year were between 2.70 and 3.55 kg CO(2) equivalents m(-2). The results from the incubation experiment were in agreement with emissions results from the lysimeter experiments. We attribute the observed differences in GHG emissions between the soils to the contrasting dry matter liability and soil physical properties. The properties of the different soil layers will determine the effect of water table regulation. Lowering the water table without exposing new layers with easily decomposable material would have a limited effect on emission rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of vegetation and microtopography on fine-scale variability of thaw depth is largely unknown but potentially important for improving modeling of ecosystem-permafrost interactions. To elucidate their influence, we measured tree density, shrub cover and cryptogam presence (lichen and bryophyte) on forested permafrost peat plateaus in the discontinuous permafrost zone in the southern Northwest Territories, Canada. Greater tree density was associated with shallower thaw depth (approximately one quarter of the variance), whereas shrub cover had a negligible influence on thaw depth. Cryptogam species influenced thaw depth, with greater thaw depth associated with Sphagnum than with Cladonia (a difference on the order of 10%). Greater thaw depth occurred beneath hummocks than beneath hollows (a difference also on the order of 10%). Together, canopy cover, cryptogam species and microforms contribute to a variation of roughly half the variance in thaw depth in the peat plateau landscape.

AB Alder (Alnus) wood peats have only rarely been subject of palaeoecological research because their bad preservation generally prevents successful reconstruction of local and regional vegetation development by means of macrofossil and pollen analysis.
   To test the potential of non-pollen palynomorphs as an additional source of information, an Alder peat core from the Ziese river valley (NE-Germany) was analysed for macro- and microfossils with special focus on non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs). 129 new types of NPPs, mostly fungal spores and remains of decomposed wood, were identified. In this paper we describe 12 new types; 13 other new types are described by Prager et al. [Prager, A., Barthelmes, A., Theuerkauf, M., Joosten, H., 2006. Non-pollen palynomorphs from modem Alder carrs and their potential for interpreting microfossil data from peat. Rev. Palaeobot. Palynol. 141, doi:10.1016/j.revpalbo.2006.03.015]. In addition 25 types already described in literature were used for interpretation of fossil samples.
   The pollen and macrofossil content revealed that the upper section of the core has been formed in a very wet Alder carr and Willow-Alder-shrub. For the lower, strongly decomposed section, NPPs were necessary to reconstruct an Alder carr as the peat forming vegetation.
   Our research reaffirms that substantial additional ecological information can be derived from analysing NPPs, especially in highly decomposed Alder peals. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lichens as sessile and slow-growing symbiotic associations have evolved various carbon-based secondary compounds (CBSCs) to mitigate the effects of some stressors in the extreme environments in which they often grow. The mat-forming lichen Cladonia stellaris, an important fodder for reindeer, produces usnic acid in the outermost layer and perlatolic acid in the medulla. Here, we studied effects of simulated global warming on these CBSCs in C. stellaris cultivated in climate chambers with: 1) ambient conditions as control or 2) ambient conditions +4 degrees C. The chambers simulated, at an hourly resolution, an averaged 10-year growing season dynamic from a long-term monitored boreal mire in northern Sweden. After two months of acclimation, +4 degrees C warming in one simulated growing season increased the concentration of usnic acid by 31% compared with ambient conditions, whereas the warming decreased the concentration of perlatolic acid by 14%. Since lichen CBSCs play important roles in ecosystem processes such as lichenivory and decomposition, these changes may profoundly affect lichen-dominated ecosystems.

DT Article
DE Bowen ratio; energy balance; evapotranspiration; wetland
ID WATER; EVAPORATION; BALANCE; ENERGY
AB Evapotranspiration rates were measured in a riparian fen wetland dominated by vascular vegetation and surrounded by open agricultural areas and forests. The wetland is situated on a floodplain in central Denmark. Measurements were taken throughout the growing season (April-September) of 1999.
   Evapotranspiration rates were higher than those published for most other wetland types, with an average of 3.6 mm d(-1) during the growing season and a peak rate of 5.6 mm d(-1). Daily average evapotranspiration was 110% of Penman's potential open water evaporation.
   Evapotranspiration was the dominant sink in the energy balance of the wetland studied. During the day, evapotranspiration accounted for 82% of the available radiant energy, R-n. Due to the presence of deposited fine-grained sediments, soil-water availability was kept high at all times which resulted in moderate canopy resistances, r(c) (overall mean = 32 s m(-1)). Evapotranspiration was controlled by a combination of driving forces: R-n, saturation vapour pressure deficit, D, and r(c).
   It is hypothesized that the results presented in this study are conditioned by the proximity of the wetland to drier upland areas. During periods with high evaporative demand and low precipitation, warm, dry air is formed over the upland areas and wetland evapotranspiration rates are enhanced by local advection. Indicative evidence for the hypothesis is presented. Although the absolute magnitude of the results reported is only directly relevant to similar sites in Denmark, the processes and controls described are considered to be representative of riparian wetlands subjected to frequent flooding and/or with a high groundwater table, with vascular vegetation, and which are narrow corridors in open agricultural landscapes.

AB The coastal ridge-swale systems in the west Estonian archipelago (Roogu, Loimastu) and on the northern coast (Juminda), where wave and wind-built ridges are separated from each other by wet depressions, contain the records on ancient shoreline positions, major storm events and forest fires. The results are based on cartographic analysis, ground-penetrating radar survey, coring and radiocarbon dating. Seaward tilted layers in lower parts of the ridges refer to storm scarps. Water level rise and acidic waters flowing from ridges favour the accumulation of Sphagnum peat in swales. The main soil-forming processes are podzolization on ridges and paludification in swales. The obtained results show a clear dependence of soil-forming conditions and development of peat layer on morphology and dimensions of landforms, character of parent material, vegetation type and groundwater table. Paludification will lead to a complete burial of the ridges under peat turning the areas to homogeneous bog landscape.

AB We used long-term laboratory incubations and chemical fractionation to characterize the mineralization dynamics of organic soils from tussock, shrub, and wet meadow tundra communities, to determine the relationship between soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and chemistry, and to quantify the relative proportions of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in tundra SOM that are biologically available for decomposition. in all soils but shrub, we found little decline in respiration rates over 1 year, although soils respired approximately a tenth to a third of total soil C. The lack of decline in respiration rates despite large C losses indicates that the quantity of organic matter available was not controlling respiration and thus suggests that something else was limiting microbial activity. To determine the nature of the respired C, we analyzed soil chemistry before and after the incubation using a peat fractionation scheme. Despite the large losses of soil C, SOM chemistry was relatively unchanged after the incubation. The decomposition dynamics we observed suggest that tundra SOM, which is largely plant detritus, fits within existing concepts of the litter decay continuum. The lack of changes in organic matter chemistry indicates that this material had already decomposed to the point where the breakdown of labile constituents was tied to lignin decomposition. N mineralization was correlated with C mineralization in our study, but shrub soil mineralized more and tussock soil less N than would have been predicted by this correlation. Our results suggest that a large proportion of tundra SOM is potentially mineralizable, despite the fact that decomposition was dependent on lignin breakdown, and that the historical accumulation of organic matter in tundra soils is the result of field conditions unfavorable to. decomposition and not the result of fundamental chemical limitations to decomposition. Our study also suggests that the anticipated increases in shrub dominance may substantially alter the dynamics of SOM decomposition in the tundra.

AB The dual-porosity structure of peat and the extremely high organic matter content give rise to a complex medium that typically generates prolonged tailing and early 50% concentration breakthrough in the breakthrough curves (BTCs) of chloride (Cl-) and other anions. Untangling whether these observations are due to rate-limited (physical) diffusion into inactive pores, (chemical) adsorption or anion exclusion remains a critical question in peat hydrogeochemistry. This study aimed to elucidate whether Cl- is truly conservative in peat, as usually assumed, and whether the prolonged tailing and early 50% concentration breakthrough of Cl- observed is due to diffusion, adsorption, anion exclusion or a combination of all three. The mobile-immobile (MiM) dual-porosity model was fit to BTCs of Cl- and deuterated water measured on undisturbed cores of the same peat soils, and equilibrium Cl- adsorption batch experiments were conducted. Adsorption of Cl- to undecomposed and decomposed peat samples in batch experiments followed Freundlich isotherms but did not exhibit any trends with the degree of peat decomposition and sorption became negligible below aqueous Cl- concentrations of similar to 310 mg L-1. The dispersivity determined by fitting the Cl- BTCs whether assuming adsorption or no adsorption were significantly different than determined by the deuterated water (p < .0001). However, no statistical differences in dispersivity (p = .27) or immobile water content (p = .97) was observed between deuterated water and Cl- when accounting for anion exclusion. A higher degree of decomposition significantly increased anion exclusion (p < .0001) but did not influence the diffusion of either tracer into the immobile porosity. Contrary to previous assumptions, Cl- is not truly conservative in peat due to anion exclusion, and adsorption at higher aqueous concentrations, but the overall effect of anion exclusion on transport is likely minimal.

AB The Oribatida is the most abundant and diverse group of mites and one of the most abundant groups of invertebrates in bogs, important for the decomposition of organic matter. These mites are relatively poorly studied in bogs and their seasonal dynamics have never been investigated in detail throughout the year. The study was performed on the periphery of a bog pond located in north-eastern Poland during four seasons. The analyses were based on 25,128 mites comprising 24,393 Oribatida from 66 species. The second most abundant group was Prostigmata, followed by Mesostigmata. The density of mites and of Oribatida reached a maximum in autumn (ca. 90,000 individuals/m(2)), and was nearly two-fold greater than in other seasons. In autumn, spring and summer the oribatid communities were dominated by the aquatic genus Limnozetes, while in winter these mites were replaced by species with lower water demands (e.g. Liochthonius alpestris, Mainothrus badius, Scheloribates laevigatus) or eurytopic ones (e.g. Oppiella nova). Oribatida reproduced in all seasons with the greatest proportion of juveniles (25%) observed in winter. Two species, Liacarus acutus and Dissorhina ornata peloponnesiaca are reported for the first time for the Polish fauna; both were found only in one season showing that sampling throughout the year is important to determine biodiversity.

AB Terrestrial export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to watercourses has increased in boreal zone. Effect of decomposing material and soil food webs on the release rate and quality of DOC are poorly known. We quantified carbon (C) release in CO2, and DOC in different molecular weights from the most common organic soils in boreal zone; and explored the effect of soil type and enchytraeid worms on the release rates. Two types of mor and four types of peat were incubated in laboratory with and without enchytraeid worms for 154 days at + 15 A degrees C. Carbon was mostly released as CO2; DOC contributed to 2-9% of C release. The share of DOC was higher in peat than in mor. The release rate of CO2 was three times higher in mor than in highly decomposed peat. Enchytraeids enhanced the release of CO2 by 31-43% and of DOC by 46-77% in mor. High molecular weight fraction dominated the DOC release. Upscaling the laboratory results into catchment level allowed us to conclude that peatlands are the main source of DOC, low molecular weight DOC originates close to watercourse, and that enchytraeids substantially influence DOC leaching to watercourse and ultimately to aquatic CO2 emissions.

AB The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of the rehabilitation of abandoned aggregate quarries to calcareous wetlands through a growth experiment at the quarry floor. We tested the effects of planting substrate (fine screenings, coarse rock, transplanted peatball, and topsoil addition to screenings) and springtime water depth (+15,0, and -15 cm relative to ground surface) on the growth of Carex aquatilis over 3 years. Survival rate of the transplanted material was 100%. Minimal growth was observed after the first growing season, but by the end of the third growing season the transplanted material had added on average 80, 4, and 3 shoots in the topsoil-amended, intact peatball, and coarse rock treatments, respectively, but lost on average 4 shoots in the fine screenings treatment. The addition of topsoil significantly increased final aboveground biomass (285 +/- 49 g per plot) compared to the peatball (40 +/- 16 g), rock (36 +/- 11 g) and screenings (35 +/- 21 g) treatments, which were not significantly different. The effect of water depth did not lead to overall significant differences, as Carex aquatilis ramets were capable of growing in springtime water levels from 15 cm above to 15 cm below ground surface. Our data demonstrate that some flooded abandoned aggregate quarry floors represent suitable sites for conversion to calcareous wetlands, even with a strategy of minimum maintenance, and that wetland species are capable of growth in these largely inorganic settings.

AB Coal layers up to 1 m thick, exposed mainly on river banks in the vicinity of Agbor, Okhuokhuo and Ubiaja, Southern Nigeria, were examined by means of organic petrology, mineralogy and geochemistry, in order to gain coal quality data and understand the palaeoenvironmental conditions during peat accumulation in the broad area of the Ogwashi-Asaba Formation. The obtained results show that coal is of low-rank C; it overlies mainly claystone derived from flooding of branches of the palaeo-Niger River. The precursor peat was accumulating in mires under mesotrophic to ombrotrophic, anoxic conditions. The peat-forming vegetation represented mainly herbaceous plants with minor tree contribution. Though the number of studied samples is low, the distribution of the lignite layers extends further towards N.NW of the known lignite-bearing area. Taking into consideration the low ash yields of some samples, there are encouraging indications for notable lignite deposits of high quality. The mineralogical composition and the activity concentrations of( 238)U, Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 exclude any severe environmental effect from coal exploitation. Due to all these promising evidences, a detailed exploration in these and between these outcrops is recommended in order to estimate the lignite potential hosted in this area.

AB Alpine wetlands are an important natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, the temporal variations and main driving factors of CH4 fluxes in alpine wetlands are not yet well understood. In this study, CH4 fluxes were measured from an alpine wetland in the Qinghai Lake using eddy covariance (EC) technique. Strong seasonal variability in the daily CH4 fluxes was observed, ranging from - 18.24 mg CH4 m(- 2) d(- 1) during the non-growing season to 117.44 mg CH4 m(- 2) d(- 1) during the growing season in 2017. The annual CH4 budget was 9.41 g CH4 m(- 2). The growing season CH4 flux accounted for 91.5 % of the annual budget. At the daily scale, the CH4 fluxes increased significantly as the net radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil temperature, and soil volumetric water content at 5 cm depth increased. Additionally, correlation analysis also revealed that daily CH4 flux was significantly related to CO2 flux when daily CO2 flux was negative, but there was no correlation when daily CO2 flux was positive. Path analysis showed that seasonal variations of soil temperature at 5 cm depth and CO2 flux had strong direct effects on daily CH4 fluxes.

AB Eddy correlation measurements of CO2 exchange (F) were made in intensively managed peat pastures at 2 different groundwater tables during most of a growing season. F was separated into a respiratory (F-r) and an assimilatory (F-a) CO2 flux. The fit of the Arrhenius temperature response to F-r showed that F-r was generally higher at low groundwater tables. The fit of a hyperbolic irradiance response to F-a showed that F-r was also generally higher at low groundwater tables, more than compensating for higher F-r. The daily CO2 balance suggested that the low groundwater pasture was a larger CO2 sink or a smaller CO2 source than the high groundwater pasture during the measurement period. The difference in F-r between the groundwater tables was substantially less than the factor 2 difference in level of soil subsidence. This suggests that oxidization of soil organic matter was a relatively minor factor in soil subsidence.

AB A monolith representing 5420 C-14 yr of peat accumulation was collected from a blanket bog at Myrarnar, Faroe Islands. The maximum Hg concentration (498 ng/g at a depth of 4.5 cm) coincides with the maximum concentration of anthropogenic Ph (111 mug/g). Age dating of recent peat accumulation using Pb-210 (CRS model) shows that the maxima in Hg and Pb concentrations occur at AD 1954 +/- 2. These results, combined with the isotopic composition of Pb in that sample (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.1720 +/- 0.0017), suggest that coal burning was the dominant source of both elements. From the onset of peat accumulation (ca. 4286 BC) until AD 1385, the ratios Hg/Br and Hg/Se were constant (2.2 +/- 0.5 x 10(-4) and 8.5 +/- 1.8 x 10(-3), respectively). Since then, Hg/Br and Hg/Se values have increased, also reaching their maxima in AD 1954. The age date of the maximum concentrations of anthropogenic Hg and Pb in the Faroe Islands is consistent with a previous study of peat cores from Greenland and Denmark (dated using the atmospheric bomb pulse curve of C-14), which showed maximum concentrations in AD 1953.
   The average rate of atmospheric Hg accumulation from 1520 BC to AD 1385 was 1.27 +/- 0.38 mug/m(2)/yr. The Br and Se concentrations and the background Hg/Br and Hg/Se ratios were used to calculate the average rate of natural Hg accumulation for the same period, 1.32 +/- 0.36 mug/m(2)/yr and 1.34 +/- 0.29 mug/m(2)/yr, respectively. These fluxes are similar to the preanthropogenic rates obtained using peat cores from Switzerland, southern Greenland, southern Ontario, Canada, and the northeastern United States. Episodic volcanic emissions and the continual supply of marine aerosols to the Faroe Islands, therefore, have not contributed significantly to the Hg inventory or the Hg accumulation rates, relative to these other areas. The maximum rate of Hg accumulation was 34 mug/m(2)/yr. The greatest fluxes of anthropogenic Hg accumulation calculated using Br and Se, respectively, were 26 and 31 mug/m(2)/yr. The rate of atmospheric Hg accumulation in 1998 (16 mug/m(2)/yr) is comparable to the values recently obtained by atmospheric transport modeling for Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland.

AB Eutrophication is a major threat for the persistence of nutrient-poor fens, as multilevel feedbacks on decomposition rates could trigger carbon loss and increase nutrient cycling. Here, we experimentally investigate the effects of macronutrient (NPK) enrichment on litter quality of six species of sedge (Carex sp.), which we relate to litter decomposition rates in a nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich environment. Our research focused on four levels: we examined how eutrophication alters (1) fresh litter production (productivity shift), (2) litter stoichiometry within the same species (intraspecific shift), (3) overall litter stoichiometry of the vegetation under the prediction that low-competitive species are outcompeted by fast-growing competitors (interspecific shift), and (4) litter decomposition rates due to an altered external environment (e.g., shifts in microbial activity; exogenous shift). Eutrophication triggered a strong increase in fresh litter production. Moreover, individuals of the same species produced litter with lower C:N and C:P ratios, higher K contents, and lower lignin, Ca and Mg contents (intraspecific shift), which increased litter decomposability. In addition, species typical for eutrophic conditions produced more easily degradable litter than did species typical for nutrient-poor conditions (interspecific shift). However, the effects of nutrient loading of the external environment (exogenous shift) were contradictory. Here, interactions between litter type and ambient nutrient level indicate that the (exogenous) effects of eutrophication on litterdecomposition rates are strongly dependent of litter quality. Moreover, parameters of litter quality only correlated with decomposition rates for litter incubated in nutrient-poor environments, but not in eutrophic environments. This suggests that rates of litter decomposition can be uncoupled from litter stoichiometry under eutrophic conditions. In conclusion, our results show that eutrophication affects litter accumulation and -decomposition at multiple levels, in which stimulatory and inhibitory effects interact. The cumulative effect of these interactions ultimately determine whether peatlands remain sinks or become sources of carbon under eutrophic conditions.

AB The Middle Jurassic Muslingebjerg Formation of Hochstetter Forland, Northeast Greenland, consists of a succession of shallow marine sandstones encasing four coal seams formed in low-lying coastal mires, The seams are up to 3.45 m thick and contain coal facies cycles with high liptinite contents (up to 70 vol%). The cycles generally start with huminite-rich bright or banded coal and end with dull coal or clayey coal/coaly claystone. The dull coals are characterized by a high proportion of liptinite, commonly resinite, and often mineral matter, Liptodetrinite, resinite and cutinite dominate the liptinite maceral group. Similarity in the relative proportions of the liptinite macerals in the bright and dull coals and the general association of bright coal and dull coal with a high resinite concentration suggest, that the dull coals represent a residue after selective removal of ligno-cellulosic tissues in the precursor peat of primarily the bright lithotype. The clayey coal/coaly claystone lithotypes have high contents of mineral matter and commonly contain alginite and pyrite. Occurrence of pyrite in levels with high diasterane C-27/C-29 ratios and sometimes also alginite in the clayey coal/coaly claystone lithotypes, indicates a marine influence during flooding of the mires. This suggests a causal link between base-level rise in the coastal mires and relative sea-level rise. Accommodation space available for thick peat accumulations was governed by overall relative sea-level rise and the dulling-upward cycles record outpacing of pear accumulation due to accelerated rise in base level/relative sea level. The Muslingebjerg Formation consists of four depositional sequences, beginning with a thick coal seam resting on a sequence boundary. Feat accumulation reflects onset of base-level rise in the coastal area and the coals represent the lower part of the transgressive systems tract. The overlying shoreface sandstones form the upper part of the transgressive systems tract and a progradational highstand systems tract. Alternatively the two lower seams in the succession may form a transgressive-regressive couplet separated by a lagoonal sandstone split. In this case a sequence boundary occurs at the top of the upper regressive seam. The dulling-upward cycles within the coal seams represent parasequences or possibly higher order sequences. Minimum age-estimates suggest that they accumulated over 4000-11000 yr. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Plant species composition influences belowground ecosystem function. However, there are few data on the interactive effects of plant diversity and soil function. We surveyed plant species diversity, and determined soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) fractions and enzyme activity in five peatlands with different vegetation-types. We also investigated the interactions between plant species diversity and richness, and soil biochemical properties. We found a close relationship between plant species diversity and total carbon (TC) in both surface (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm) layers. Plant diversity and richness positively correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+-N in both soil layers and subsoil moisture and total nitrogen (TN), as well as topsoil pH. Plant species diversity and richness were also positively correlated with subsoil moisture, pH, protease, acid phosphatase activity and topsoil urease activity. Soil beta-glucosidase, invertase, urease, protease, and acid phosphatase activity positively correlated with soil TC, TN, DOC, available N and soil moisture. Our findings demonstrate that plant community diversity is linked with soil C and N turnover through soil enzyme activity. These results will improve our ability to more fully understand the linkages between aboveground and belowground components in peatland ecosystems.

AB The aim of this study is to provide useful coal-petrographic data, which will further help the characterization, exploitation, and utilization of the Kardia lignite deposit and also initially to access the depositional conditions mainly in terms of water table level and subsidence rate of the fen substrate. Ash contents, as well as the C, H, N, O, and S were determined in nine lignite samples from core KT6A-3. The ash contents (750 degrees C) of the studied lignite seams range among 14-37% (on dry basis). Contents of C, H, N, and O have values between 34-52%, 2.5-4.2%, 0.8-2%, and 21-30.6%, respectively. Sulfur does not exceed 1.2%. Huminite group dominates with values between 84-99 vol%, mmf. All samples display a distinct prevalence in detrohuminite ( up to 82 vol%) with attrinite being most abundant. Liptinite and inertinite macerals have low contents, which do not exceed 8% and 12%, respectively. The Kardia lignites are medium to very low-grade coals. They formed in fens under limnotelmatic regime and originated from herbaceous vegetation. During peat deposition, conditions were well moist, intense reducing, and favored increased bacterial activity. The ratio of plant growth and peat accumulation versus rise of water table due to the subsidence rate was not well balanced. The petrographical composition of the Kardia lignites is related either to a long residence time of the organic matter in the acrotelm or to an herbaceous vegetation origin.

AB Litter mixing effects during decomposition remain inconclusive for boreal peatlands, and such effects may vary with climate warming and associated shifts in vegetation composition. Here, litters were collected from four common species (deciduous shrub Betula fruticosa, evergreen shrub Ledwn palustre, graminoid Erioplurum vaginally'', and moss Sphagnum divinum) in a boreal peatland of northeast China, resulting in 15 species combinations with species richness ranging from one to four. We determined litter mixing effects on carbon (C) mineralization rate and mass loss under aerobic conditions at 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C in a 315-d incubation experiment, and assessed the differences in litter mass loss for the individual species within monocultures and mixtures. Nonadditive effects on C mineralization and mass loss were prevalent during decomposition of litter mixtures. Moreover, the sensitivity of C mineralization and mass loss to rising incubation temperature (Q(10)) was found to be non-additive in five and three out of 11 mixtures, respectively. Notably, mass loss of other litters in the mixtures was generally promoted by B. fruticosa, but inhibited by S. divinum in two- and three-species litter mixtures. Furthermore, B. fruticosa increased and S. divinum decreased Q(10) values for mass loss of other litters in four out of seven cases. These findings suggest that the shifts in plant community composition will not only influence community-level litter decomposition through altered litter mixing effects during decomposition, but also modulate the response of litter decomposition to rising temperature in boreal peatlands.

AB Natural and anthropogenic mercury (Hg) emissions are sequestered in terrestrial soils over short, annual to long, millennial timescales before Hg mobilization and run-off impact wetland and coastal ocean ecosystems. Recent studies have used Hg-to-carbon (C) ratios (R-HgC's) measured in Alaskan permafrost mineral and peat soils together with a northern circumpolar permafrost soil carbon inventory to estimate that these soils contain large amounts of Hg (between 184 and 755 Gg) in the upper 1 m. However, measurements of R-HgC on Siberian permafrost peatlands are largely missing, leaving the size of the estimated northern soil Hg budget and its fate under Arctic warming scenarios uncertain. Here we present Hg and carbon data for six peat cores down to mineral horizons at 1.5-4 m depth, across a 1700 km latitudinal (56 to 67 degrees N) permafrost gradient in the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL). Mercury concentrations increase from south to north in all soil horizons, reflecting a higher stability of sequestered Hg with respect to re-emission. The R-HgC in the WSL peat horizons decreases with depth, from 0.38 GgPg(-1) in the active layer to 0.23 GgPg(-1) in continuously frozen peat of the WSL. We estimate the Hg pool (01 m) in the permafrost-affected part of the WSL peatlands to be 9.3 +/- 2.7 Gg. We review and estimate pan-Arctic organic and mineral soil RHgC to be 0.19 and 0.63 GgPg(-1), respectively, and use a soil carbon budget to revise the pan-Arctic permafrost soil Hg pool to be 72 Gg (39-91 Gg; interquartile range, IQR) in the upper 30 cm, 240 Gg (110-336 Gg) in the upper 1 m, and 597 Gg (384-750 Gg) in the upper 3 m. Using the same R-HgC approach, we revise the upper 30 cm of the global soil Hg pool to contain 1086 Gg of Hg (852-1265 Gg, IQR), of which 7% (72 Gg) resides in northern permafrost soils. Additional soil and river studies in eastern and northern Siberia are needed to lower the uncertainty on these estimates and assess the timing of Hg release to the atmosphere and rivers.

AB Peats are an important reserve of humified carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. The interest in the use of humic substances as plant growth promoters is continuously increasing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the bioactivity of alkaline soluble humic substances (HS), humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA) isolated from peats with different decomposition stages of organic matter (sapric, fibric and hemic) in the Serra do Espinhaco Meridional, state of Minas Gerais. Dose-response curves were established for the number of lateral roots growing from the main plant axis of tomato seedlings. The bioactivity of HA was greatest (highest response in lateral roots at lowest concentration) while FA did not intensify root growth. Both HS and HA stimulated root hair formation. At low concentrations, HS and HA induced root hair formation near the root cap, a typical hormonal imbalance effect in plants. Transgenic tomato with reporter gene DR5::GUS allowed the observation that the auxin-related signalling pathway was involved in root growth promotion by HA.

TI IDENTIFICATION OF FREE AMINO-ACIDS IN PEAT BY GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY AND
   MASS-SPECTROMETRY
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The qualitative and quantitative composition of free amino acids in a typical Finnish peat bog at various depths down to 5.3 m below the surface was studied using capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.
   Sixteen amino acids were identified at each depth: alpha-alanine, beta-alanine, glycine, valine, leucine, proline, isoleucine, serine, threonine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, phenylalanine, tyrosine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, ornithine and lysine. Their amounts decreased markedly at a depth of 40-100 cm. The total amount of amino acids varied between 0.6 and 5.6 g kg(-1) dry matter (i.e. 0.06-0.56%) depending on the depth. The proportion of neutral amino acids was greatest al all depths studied, except at the surface layer where it ranged between 41 and 72% by mass. The acidic amino acids decreased with depth from 56 to 23% of the total. The proportion of aromatic amino acids was very small, 3.2-5.5% by mass.
   In samples from aerobic conditions, where the microbial production of free amino acids was the greatest, alpha-ala, gly, glu and asp were most abundant. In peat from anaerobic conditions, where the microbiological activity was low, the proportion of the most chemically stable amino acid was exceptionally high. This may have been because glycine was a degradation product of other amino acids or peptides.
   Peat type and degree of decomposition had a strong influence on the total amount of free amino acids and their qualitative composition.

AB Wildfires in Siberia are documented to have increased in frequency and severity over recent decades. However, in the absence of long-term records, it is unclear how far and why this trend deviates from centennial to millennial scale variability. Here we reconstruct past patterns of fire frequency and fire type, and explore how the fire-related traits of boreal species and plant functional types (PFTs) determine ecosystem responses to changing fire regimes. We use charcoal-based reconstructions of the fire regime in combination with a pollen-based assessment of vegetation composition in two boreal forest peat profiles from Plotnikovo Mire in western Siberia that span the last 2400 and 5000 years. We found moderate levels of biomass burning between 5000 and 4000 cal yr BP. Biomass burning and fire severity i.e., more biomass burning per fire episode, increased over the last 1500 cal yr BP associated with the dominance of fire invaders (Betula). Conversely, between 4000 and 1500 cal yr BP lower biomass burning, with perhaps fire types affecting mostly litter and understorey vegetation, coincided with the dominance of fire resisters (e.g., Pinus sylvestris, P. sibirica, Larix) intermixed with a considerable number of fire avoiders (e.g., Abies sibirica and Picea obovata). This long-term perspective shows that the current fire regime commenced 1500 years ago and deviates from the trends observed over the last 5000 years. This deviation is linked to a combination of climate conditions conducive to fire, the amount and composition of woody fuels, and land use changes. Although pines reacted more sensitively to increased fire severity, the fire avoider Picea obovata appears to be much more vulnerable to both frequent, severe fires than Abies sibirica. We anticipate that climatically driven changes in fire weather, with frequent warm and dry spells, and anthropogenic land use intensification will heighten fire severity and their impact, driving vegetation composition towards Betula species to the detriment of Picea obovata. This study also shows that charcoal morphotypes can provide useful information on fuel and fire type, and that, although all macro-charcoal size classes reliably indicate local-scale fires, the larger fraction (>300 -500 mu m) allows the identification of on-site fire episodes. We recommend multi-site palaeo-fire reconstructions in boreal peatlands to adequately reflect the influence of localised peat moisture content, and vegetation composition and structure variability on the small-scale heterogeneity of fire type and spread. This will ensure that trends in fire regime dynamics are representative and not limited to the local scale. We also propose future directions in fire research that can be tested using fossil records of fire, climate and vegetation ideally in an interdisciplinary approach. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nearly 5000 chamber measurements of CH4 flux were collated from 21 sites across the United Kingdom, covering a range of soil and vegetation types, to derive a parsimonious model that explains as much of the variability as possible, with the least input requirements. Mean fluxes ranged from -0.3 to 27.4 nmol CH4 m-2 s-1, with small emissions or low rates of net uptake in mineral soils (site means of -0.3 to 0.7 nmol m-2 s-1) and much larger emissions from organic soils (site means of -0.3 to 27.4 nmol m-2 s-1). Less than half of the observed variability in instantaneous fluxes could be explained by independent variables measured. The reasons for this include measurement error, stochastic processes and, probably most importantly, poor correspondence between the independent variables measured and the actual variables influencing the processes underlying methane production, transport and oxidation. When temporal variation was accounted for, and the fluxes averaged at larger spatial scales, simple models explained up to ca. 75% of the variance in CH4 fluxes. Soil carbon, peat depth, soil moisture and pH together provided the best sub-set of explanatory variables. However, where plant species composition data were available, this provided the highest explanatory power. Linear and nonlinear models generally fitted the data equally well, with the exception that soil moisture required a power transformation. To estimate the impact of changes in peatland water table on CH4 emissions in the United Kingdom, an emission factor of +0.4 g CH4 m-2 yr-1 per cm increase in water table height was derived from the data.

AB Two commercial nurseries located in Comunidad Valenciana region (central-eastern Spain) were sampled in 2010 to evaluate whether the grapevine nursery propagation process could be a source of black-foot disease pathogens. Samples were taken from four sources of the propagation process: pre-grafting hydration tanks, scissors used for cutting buds, omega-cut grafting machines, and peat used for callusing. DNA from these samples was extracted and multiplex nested-PCR using primers specific for "Cylindrocarpon" pauciseptatum, Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex (composed of I. alcacerensis, I. estremocensis, I. macrodidyma, I. novozelandica, I. torresensis, and two undescribed species) was used to identify the species present. Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex were detected in hydration tanks, scissors, grafting machines and peat, I. macrodidyma-complex being the most frequent. Additionally, ten grafted cuttings each from five grapevine scion/rootstock combinations were collected from each nursery immediately after callusing, and again after one growing season in a nursery field. Roots of these grafted cuttings and plants were sampled to isolate the fungal pathogens. Only I. torresensis was isolated after callusing, while I. liriodendri, I. novozelandica and I. torresensis were isolated after one growing season, showing the highest incidence at this latter sampling time. Moreover, DNA was extracted from roots and analyzed as described before. Ilyonectria liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex were also detected at both sampling times. The use of the multiplex nested-PCR technique improved the detection of I. liriodendri and I. macrodidyma-complex from grafted cuttings and plants in both nurseries. This work shows that the grapevine nursery propagation process should be considered as a potential infection source for black-foot disease pathogens, and confirms that infections caused by Ilyonectria spp. in grapevine planting material increase markedly after one growing season in nursery fields.

AB Methods used to estimate the CO2 emission from soil commonly measure the total CO2 flux. To be able to quantify the net CO2 emission from cultivated peat soils there is a need to distinguish between soil organic matter-derived CO2 respiration and plant-derived respiration. In this investigation we used the root exclusion method to separate the plant-derived respiration from total CO2 emission. The plant-derived contribution was estimated to be between 27 and 63% of total CO2 emission depending on soil type and season. We also found a relationship between soil temperature, biomass growth and CO2 efflux, which can be used to estimate plant-derived respiration. Due to the priming effect the root exclusion method is less reliable late in the season.

AB Boreal soils play a critical role in the global carbon (C) cycle; therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms that control soil C accumulation and loss for this region. Examining C & nitrogen (N) accumulation rates over decades to centuries may provide additional understanding of the dominant mechanisms for their storage, which can be masked by seasonal and interannual variability when investigated over the short term. We examined longer-term accumulation rates, using Pb-210 and C-14 to date soil layers, for a wide variety of boreal ecosystems: a black spruce forest, a shrub ecosystem, a tussock grass ecosystem, a sedge-dominated ecosystem, and a rich fen. All ecosystems had similar decadal C accumulation rates, averaging 84 +/- 42 gCm(-2) yr(-1). Long-term (century) C accumulation rates were slower than decadal rates, averaging 14 +/- 5 gCm(-2) yr(-1) for all ecosystems except the rich fen, for which the long-term C accumulation rates was more similar to decadal rates (44 +/- 5 and 76 +/- 9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). The rich fen also had the highest long-term N accumulation rates (2.7 gNm(-2) yr(-1)). The lowest N accumulation rate, on both a decadal and long-term basis, was found in the black spruce forest (0.2 and 1.4 gNm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). Our results suggest that the controls on long-term C and N cycling at the rich fen is fundamentally different from the other ecosystems, likely due to differences in the predominant drivers of nutrient cycling (oxygen availability, for C) and reduced amounts of disturbance by fire (for C and N). This result implies that most shifts in ecosystem vegetation across the boreal region, driven by either climate or succession, will not significantly impact regional C or N dynamics over years to decades. However, ecosystem transitions to or from a rich fen will promote significant shifts in soil C and N storage.

AB During the Pliocene (2.6 to 5 Ma ago) atmospheric CO2 levels have been estimated as similar to or slightly above present levels (Tripati et al., 2009; Pagani et al., 2010), and yet Earth's climate was considerably different. Recent evidence suggests that although global temperatures were 2-3 degrees C warmer than pre-industrial, Arctic warming may have been amplified during the Pliocene. Thus precise temperature records of this interval are required to assess the sensitivity of Earth's climate to persistent levels of CO2 between 365 and 415 ppm. We present records of two independent proxies for terrestrial growing-season temperatures at the Early Pliocene Beaver Pond site on Ellesmere Island. delta O-18 values of cellulose from well-preserved peat constrain the delta O-18 values of meteoric water to -20.7 +/- 03%., which we combined with delta(18)Ovalues of aragonitic freshwater molluscs found within the peat in order to calculate mollusc growth temperatures. This approach results in an average growing-season temperature of 14.2 +/- 1.3 degrees C. Temperatures were independently derived by applying carbonate 'clumped isotope' thermometry to mollusc shells from the same site, indicating an average growing-season temperature of 10.2 +/- 1.4 degrees C. A one-way ANOVA indicates that the differences between the two techniques are not significant as the difference in mean temperatures between both methods is no different than the difference between individual shells using a single technique. Both techniques indicate temperatures similar to 11-16 degrees C warmer than present (May-Sept temperature = -1.6 +/- 13 degrees C) and represent the first thermodynamic proxy results for Early Pliocene Ellesmere Island.

AB Woody plants in fire-frequented ecosystems commonly resprout from underground organs after fires. Responses to variation in characteristics of fire regimes may be a function of plant physiological status or fire intensity. Although these hypotheses have been explored for trees in southeastern longleaf pine (Pines palustris) savannas, responses of other life forms and stages have not been studied. We examined effects of fire season and frequency, geography, habitat, and underground organ morphology on resprouting of shrubs. In 1994, we located replicated sites, each containing two habitats, upslope savannas and downslope seepages, in Louisiana and Florida. Each site, which contained quadrats located along transects within a 30 X 60 m plot, was burned either during the dormant or growing season and then reburned similarly two years later. Maximum fire temperatures were measured, and densities of shrub stems were censused in quadrats before and after fires.
   Shrubs collectively resprouted more following dormant than growing-season fires, regardless of habitat or geographic region. After repeated dormant-season fires, collective densities in seepages of both regions and densities of root-crown-bearing shrubs in Florida seepages were greater than those initially and after repeated growing-season fires. Shrub responses were generally unrelated to fire temperatures, supporting the hypothesis that resprouting of shrubs may be more dependent on their physiological status at the time of fires. There was, nonetheless, an inverse relationship between collective and root-crown-bearing shrub densities following repeated fires and maximum fire temperatures in Florida seepages. Anthropogenic dormant-season fires over many decades may have resulted in increases in shrub densities in longleaf pine savannas, especially seepages. Repeated growing-season fires, however, neither increased nor reduced densities of established shrubs. Long-term shifts in characteristics of fire regimes, even in fire-frequented habitats, may produce effects that are not reversible in the short term (<10 yr) by simply reintroducing prescribed fires that resemble those that occurred naturally during the growing season.

AB Matric water potential and air-filled porosity were determined at four sampling dates during the growing season for trickle-irrigated pine bark and peat-based media that differed in composition and particle size distribution.  At low and high inoculum densities (nine and 30 infested oat grains per container) of Phytophthora cinnamomi, severity of Phytophthora root rot of Rhododendron sp. was significantly less in pine bark media than in peat/sand/soil.  Differences in root rot severity between the pine bark media and the peat/sand/soil medium were best explained by differences in air-filled porosity and matrix water potential among media.  Matric water potential generally fluctuated from -1.0 to -3.0 kPa between irrigations in the pine bark media and from 0 to -1.0 kPa between irrigations in the peat/sand/soil medium.  Pine bark media had volumetric air-filled porosities that fluctuated from about 40% just after irrigation to about 45% 48 h later, whereas peat/sand/soil had an air-filled porosity near 10% after irrigation and about 20% 48 h later.  Irrigation water ponded on the surface of containers with peat/sand/soil immediately after trickle irrigation.  This was not observed in containers with pine bark media.  Relatively large pores that provide high air-filled porosity in pine bark media account for the rapidity with which pine bark media drain after irrigation, which resulted in matric potentials unfavorable for zoospore discharge and dispersal.

AB Recent (1964-1989) rates of peat accretion and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and organic carbon (C) accumulation were measured in Everglades soils to characterize the effects of altered hydroperiod and nutrient regimes on the nutrient storage capacity of the Everglades ecosystem. Peat accretion was related to hydroperiod and phosphorus loading. Accretion rates were highest in areas of extended hydroperiod (2.8-3.2 mm/yr) and/or phosphorus enrichment (4.0 mm/yr) and lowest in areas of reduced hydroperiod (1.6-2.0 mm/yr). Rates of accumulation of nitrogen were 3.8-11.6 g-m-2.yr-1 (chiBAR = 8.2 g.M-2-yr-1) and those of organic C were 54-161 g-m-2.yr-1 (chiBAR = 104 g.M-2.yr-1). Accumulation rates of N and organic C were primarily a function of peat accretion rates. Phosphorus accumulation was controlled by both peat accretion and increased soil P content. Soil P concentrations (1248 mug/g) in an area receiving N and P enriched agricultural runoff were 2-3 times higher than P levels at unenriched locations (432-764 mug/g). As a result, rates of P accumulation at this site (0.46 g.m-2.yr-1) were 2-8 times greater compared to unenriched Everglades soils (0.06-0.23 g.m-2-yr-1). Inputs of P (0.53 g.M-2. yr-1) and N (15.5 g.m-2-yr-1) to the nutrient-enriched area of Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A (via rainfall and surface flow) were nine and twelve times higher than inputs to the unenriched part of WCA 2A. As a result, the efficiency of P removal was lower at the enriched site (87%) than at the unenriched location (100%). Nitrogen removal efficiencies also were lower in the enriched area (75%) as compared to the unenriched area, where N accumulation in peat was 290-450% of the input. The difference in N storage efficiencies between the two sites may reflect differences in N fixation and denitrification in nutrient-enriched and unenriched Everglades peatlands. Our findings suggest that nutrient-enriched agricultural drainage has contributed to increased rates of peat accretion and phosphorus accumulation in areas of the northern Everglades that have been receiving agricultural drainage for the past 25-30 yr. The affected area has functioned effectively as a phosphorus sink, primarily due to increased organic P storage. However, the effects of nutrient loading, especially P, on the long-term stability of the Everglades ecosystem and on the long-term P storage potential of Everglades peats are poorly understood and are currently under investigation.

TI Radiocarbon dating of modern peat profiles: Pre- and post-bomb C-14
   variations in the construction of age-depth models
SO RADIOCARBON
LA English
DT Article
ID BOG; DEPOSITION; CALIBRATION; ARCHIVE; MERCURY; BP
AB We present studies of 9 modem (up to 400-yr-old) peat sections from Slovenia, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and Finland. Precise radiocarbon dating of modem samples is possible due to the large bomb peak of atmospheric C-14 concentration in 1963 and the following rapid decline in the C-14 level. All the analyzed C-14 profiles appeared concordant with the shape of the bomb peak of atmospheric C-14 concentration, integrated over some time interval with a length specific to the peat section. In the peat layers covered by the bomb peak, calendar ages of individual peat samples could be determined almost immediately, with an accuracy of 2-3 yr. In the pre-bomb sections, the calendar ages of individual dated samples are determined in the form of multi-modal probability distributions of about 300 yr wide (about AD 1650-1950). However, simultaneous use of the post-bomb and pre-bomb C-14 dates, and lithological information, enabled the rejection of most modes of probability distributions in the pre-bomb section. In effect, precise age-depth models of the post-bomb sections have been extended back in time, into the "wiggly" part of the C-14 calibration curve.
   Our study has demonstrated that where annual resolution is concerned, tissues of Sphagnum are the only representative material for C-14 dating, although even samples of pure Sphagnum collected from a very thin slice of the peat section contain tissues grown in different years, so they integrate the atmospheric C-14 signal over a period of time. This time period (0.5-8 yr, depending on the site) seems to correlate with the peat accumulation rate, but it also depends on how the sampled peat sections were handled. When constructing age-depth models, for some peat sections we used the strategy of multi-stage C-14 dating. This led to a drastic reduction in the uncertainty of the age-depth models, by dating only a few additional samples in the profile.
   Our study is the first in which peat sections from the late pre-bomb time (AD 1900-1960) have been precisely dated at a high temporal resolution. In this time interval, C-14 ages of all the samples dated were younger than those derived from the atmospheric calibration curve, apparently due to the effect of integration. Evidently, the determination of calendar ages based on C-14 dating of single peat samples from that interval may be affected by a serious error if the possibility of integration is ignored.

AB Given their relatively small area, mangroves and their organic sediments are of disproportionate importance to global carbon sequestration and carbon storage. Peat deposition and preservation allows some mangroves to accrete vertically and keep pace with sea-level rise by growing on their own root remains. In this study we show that mangroves in desert inlets in the coasts of the Baja California have been accumulating root peat for nearly 2,000 y and harbor a belowground carbon content of 900-34,00 Mg C/ha, with an average value of 1,130 (+/- 128) Mg C/ha, and a belowground carbon accumulation similar to that found under some of the tallest tropical mangroves in the Mexican Pacific coast. The depth-age curve for the mangrove sediments of Baja California indicates that sea level in the peninsula has been rising at a mean rate of 0.70 mm/y (+/- 0.07) during the last 17 centuries, a value similar to the rates of sea-level rise estimated for the Caribbean during a comparable period. By accreting on their own accumulated peat, these desert mangroves store large amounts of carbon in their sediments. We estimate that mangroves and halophyte scrubs in Mexico's arid northwest, with less than 1% of the terrestrial area, store in their belowground sediments around 28% of the total belowground carbon pool of the whole region.

TI Dead carbon in stalagmites: Carbonate bedrock paleodissolution vs.
   ageing of soil organic matter. Implications for C-13 variations in

AB Twenty-one C-14 accelerator mass spectrometric analyses were obtained for three Holocene stalagmites from the Uamh-an-Tartair cave (Sutherland, Scotland) in order to estimate the past dead carbon proportion (dcp). Results show that the dcp increases from 22 to 38% from 3780 years ago to the present. Because delta C-13 variation is small within each sample, it is concluded that this dcp increase is the product of the ageing of soil organic matter related to peat bog development above the cave that produced older soil CO2 and not from a more intense dissolution of the surrounding carbonates, which would have led to a delta C-13 increase.
   Comparison with samples from other sites in Europe shows no intersite correlation between dcp and delta C-13, but a relatively good intersite correlation is observed between dcp and average site temperature. Thus, temperature may be a major factor controlling the production of old soil organic matter CO2 and, therefore, the dead carbon content of seepage water, In contrast to the Scotland stalagmites, two other Holocene samples from sites in southern France and Belgium exhibit a good correlation between delta C-13 and dcp, which can be explained in terms of variations in the intensity of limestone dissolution. Consequently, delta C-13 variations observed in stalagmites are not always due to changes in the vegetation type (C3/C4) as has been commonly assumed; C-13/C-12 variations in speleothem calcite may also be controlled by the soil organic matter age and, in some cases, by the intensity of the limestone dissolution. Conversely, a largely constant speleothem delta C-13 signal, as observed for the Scotland stalagmites, does not necessarily imply that surface climate and vegetation conditions were stable since the dcp variations. in this case, are clearly related to the peat bog development during stalagmite growth.

AB Heterotrophic soil microorganisms rely on carbon (C) allocated belowground in plant production, but belowground C allocation (BCA) by plants is a poorly quantified part of ecosystem C cycling, especially, in peat soil. We applied a C balance approach to quantify BCA in a mixed conifer-red maple (Acer rubrum) forest on deep peat soil. Direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 fluxes across the soil surface (soil respiration), production of fine and small plant roots, and aboveground litterfall were used to estimate respiration by roots, by mycorrhizae and by free-living soil microorganisms. Measurements occurred in two consecutive years. Soil respiration rates averaged 1.2 bm mumol m(-2) s(-1) for CO2 and 0.58 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for CH4 (371 to 403 g C m(-2) year- 1). Carbon in aboveground litter (144 g C m(-2) year(-1)) was 84% greater than C in root production (78 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Complementary in vitro assays located high rates of anaerobic microbial activity, including methanogenesis, in a dense layer of roots overlying the peat soil and in large-sized fragments within the peat matrix. Large-sized fragments were decomposing roots and aboveground leaf and twig litter, indicating that relatively fresh plant production supported most of the anaerobic microbial activity. Respiration by free-living soil microorganisms in deep peat accounted for, at most, 29 to 38 g C m(-2) year(-1). These data emphasize the close coupling between plant production, ecosystem-level C cycling and soil microbial ecology, which BCA can help reveal.

AB Despite the importance of soil and surface waters freezing in permafrost landscapes, the behaviour of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrients and metals during periodic freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) remains poorly known. The on-going climate warming is likely to increase the frequency of FTC in continental aquatic settings, which could modify the chemical composition of waters. In this study, we conducted 9 repetitive cycles of overnight freezing (similar to 20 degrees C) and 5 h thawing (4 degrees C) in the laboratory using representative 0.22 mu m-filtered waters from NE European permafrost peatland: leachates of vegetation and soil, and natural surface waters (depression, thermokarst lake and river). Only minor (<5%-15%) changes of DOC concentrations, SUVA(254) and molecular weight were observed in all leachates and the depression water. In contrast, several trace elements (Fe, Al, P, Mn, As, and REE) exhibited sizable variations during FTC (>10%). The leachates and the depression water were enriched in trace elements, whereas the thermokarst lake and the river demonstrated a decrease in concentration of Fe (similar to 39 and similar to 94%, respectively), Al (similar to 9 and similar to 85%), and Mn (similar to 10 and similar to 79%) during FTC. Overall, the observations demonstrated an increase in aliphatic low molecular weight organic matter (OM), and the precipitation of Fe, Al hydroxides and organo-mineral particles. Therefore, enhanced of frequency of FTC can favour the release of metals and toxicants from acidic OM-rich surface waters and maintain stable OM-metalscolloids in large lakes and rivers, thus regulating aquatic transport of DOC and metals from soils to the Arctic Ocean.

AB Coal seams often exhibit lateral and vertical variability in composition. When sampled as a whole seam this variability is masked. But if a seam is subdivided into correlateable components, this variability can be tested and better understood. Herein, an architectural approach is used to divide seams into intra-seam components. Clastic splits and mineral partings, as well as persistent fusain and durain layers, can be used as intra-seam bounding units to subdivide a seam into subdivisions called benches. Regional examination of Lower and Middle Pennsylvanian-age coal seams shows that many contain laterally persistent bounding surfaces that can be used to define multiple benches of coal within each seam. Inter-bench analyses from some of the most extensively mined seams in the central Appalachian Basin show that individual benches often have different spatial and quality trends. Hence, some component of whole-seam variability is a function of changes in the relative contribution of these different benches to the seam as a whole. Many coal benches also exhibit intra-bench variation in coal parameters. Intra-bench variation can be analyzed in terms of parameters such as sulfur content and ash yield in order to address chances in coal quality for regional resource evaluation. Intra-bench variation can also be analyzed in terms of a combination of palynologic, petrographic, and geochemical parameters, termed compositional groups, in order to better understand the development of the original mire systems. Compositional groups are defined by ranges of multiple criteria, which are inferred to owe their origin to the mire type in which they formed. Vertical changes in compositional groups within coal benches can be used to infer paleo-edaphic conditions during peat accumulation. If seam thickness is a product of bench configuration, and trends in compositional groups occur in benches, then trends in quality can be marginally predicted based upon seam thickness and inferred bench architecture. Additionally, changes in inter-bench and intra-bench thickness and compositional profiles can be used to infer original depositional controls, such as paleotopography, syndepositional structural movement, and syndepositional elastic influx for more accurate reserve estimates.

AB Tundra soils account for 50% of global stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), and it is expected that the amplified climate warming in high latitude could cause loss of this SOC through decomposition. Decomposed SOC could become hydrologically accessible, which increase downstream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and subsequent carbon release to the atmosphere, constituting a positive feedback to climate warming. However, DOC export is often neglected in ecosystem models. In this paper, we incorporate processes related to DOC production, mineralization, diffusion, sorption-desorption, and leaching into a customized arctic version of the dynamic ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS in order to mechanistically model catchment DOC export, and to link this flux to other ecosystem processes. The extended LPJ-GUESS is compared to observed DOC export at Stordalen catchment in northern Sweden. Vegetation communities include flood-tolerant graminoids (Eriophorum) and Sphagnum moss, birch forest and dwarf shrub communities. The processes, sorption-desorption and microbial decomposition (DOC production and mineralization) are found to contribute most to the variance in DOC export based on a detailed variance-based Sobol sensitivity analysis (SA) at grid cell-level. Catchment-level SA shows that the highest mean DOC exports come from the Eriophorum peatland (fen). A comparison with observations shows that the model captures the seasonality of DOC fluxes. Two catchment simulations, one without water lateral routing and one without peatland processes, were compared with the catchment simulations with all processes. The comparison showed that the current implementation of catchment lateral flow and peatland processes in LPJ-GUESS are essential to capture catchment-level DOC dynamics and indicate the model is at an appropriate level of complexity to represent the main mechanism of DOC dynamics in soils. The extended model provides a new tool to investigate potential interactions among climate change, vegetation dynamics, soil hydrology and DOC dynamics at both stand-alone to catchment scales.

AB The distribution and quantitative recovery of N-15-labelled urea fertilizer was studied in a tamarack/black spruce ecosystem on a drained minerotrophic peatland in central Alberta, Canada. The site was ditched in Fall 1987 and urea fertilizer at 53 kg ha(-1) was applied on 1 June 1989. Recovery of labelled N 3 and 15 months after fertilization was determined in tree and understory vegetation biomass, and in soil. Fertilizer N showed little mobility in soil and tended to accumulate within the 0-20 cm depth. Mean fertilizer N recovery in soil at 3 and 15 months after fertilization was about 54 and 47%, respectively, of the applied N. Corresponding recovery in above tree components was 5.7 and 9.2%, respectively. This increase in recovery of fertilizer N in aboveground tree components was attributable to black spruce since N-15 recovered in black spruce increased significantly during the second growing season. In both years a greater proportion of N was recovered in black spruce compared with tamarack. A substantial amount of N was recovered in understory vegetation suggesting that understory may be a significant sink for N.

AB Alder (Alnus) carr peats have only rarely been subject of palacoecological research because their mostly bad preservation prevents successful reconstruction of local and regional vegetation development by means of macrofossil and pollen analysis.
   To test the potential of non-pollen palynomorphs as an additional source of information, surface samples from five different types of substrates and three different Alder forest types were analysed on microfossils with special focus on non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs). Forty-six new types of NPPs, mostly fungal spores and remains of decomposed wood, were described and illustrated.
   Ordination of the more common NPPs revealed a good differentiation between substrate groups and - to a lesser extent - site types. Comparison with microfossil data from Alder carr peat showed that the ecological information derived from the modem samples is consistent with the environmental conditions reconstructed from palaeoecological data (pollen, macrofossils, degree of decomposition) from the peat core.
   The analysis of NPPs in surface samples is a promising tool to assess the indicator value of NPPs, allowing an improved interpretation of fossil data. The fact that 2.6 times more NPP types than pollen types were found in the fossil samples illustrates the importance and potential of NPPs for palaeo-palynological research. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB This article reports the first discovery of middle Holocene cryptotephra from a peat sequence in Estonia, eastern Baltic. Two sequences, Mustjarve and Parika (located 110 km apart), were chosen for a pilot study aimed at finding traces of tephra fallout during the middle Holocene. Peat accumulation at both sites started in the early Holocene (c. 9500 - 9000 C-14 yr BP; c. 11 000 - 10 000 cal. yr BP) and continued throughout the whole Holocene. The radiocarbon-dated intervals between c. 2000 and 5000 C-14 yr BP (c. 2000 - 5500 cal. yr BP) were chosen from both sites for the study. Colourless tephra shards were identified at 312 - 316 cm below the peat surface in the Mustjarve peat sequence, while no tephra was found in peat of the same age at Parika. Electron microprobe analyses suggest a correlation with the initial phase of the Hekla-4 eruption (c. 4260 cal. yr BP), although the age - depth model indicated an age around 4900 cal. yr BP. Small concentrations of colourless to light brown tephra shards at 266 - 270 cm in the Mustjarve sequence indicate that the Kebister tephra (c. 3750 cal. yr BP) might also be present, but geochemical analyses were not possible. The low concentration and small size of the tephra particles indicate that Estonian bogs are probably on the verge of where tephrochronology is possible in northwestern Europe. Further studies of full Holocene sequences are required in order to discover traces of other ash plumes reaching as far east as the eastern Baltic area.

   potential to act as a carbon sink - a synthesis

   MODEL
AB Based on review and original data, this synthesis investigates carbon pools and fluxes of Siberian and European forests (600 and 300 million ha, respectively). We examine the productivity of ecosystems, expressed as positive rate when the amount of carbon in the ecosystem increases, while (following micrometeorological convention) downward fluxes from the atmosphere to the vegetation (NEE=Net Ecosystem Exchange) are expressed as negative numbers. Productivity parameters are Net Primary Productivity (NPP=whole plant growth), Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP = CO2 assimilation minus ecosystem respiration), and Net Biome Productivity (NBP=NEP minus carbon losses through disturbances bypassing respiration, e.g. by fire and logging). Based on chronosequence studies and national forestry statistics we estimate a low average NPP for boreal forests in Siberia: 123 gC m(-2) y(-1). This contrasts with a similar calculation for Europe which suggests a much higher average NPP of 460 gC m(-2) y(-1) for the forests there. Despite a smaller area, European forests have a higher total NPP than Siberia (1.2-1.6 vs. 0.6-0.9 x 10(15) gC region(-1) y(-1)). This arises as a consequence of differences in growing season length, climate and nutrition.
   For a chronosequence of Pinus sylvestris stands studied in central Siberia during summer, NEE was most negative in a 67-y old stand regenerating after fire (-192 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) which is close to NEE in a cultivated forest of Germany (-210 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Considerable net ecosystem CO2-uptake was also measured in Siberia in 200- and 215-y old stands (NEE:174 and - 63 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) while NEP of 7- and 13-y old logging areas were close to the ecosystem compensation point. Two Siberian bogs and a bog in European Russia were also significant carbon sinks (-102 to - 104 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Integrated over a growing season (June to September) we measured a total growing season NEE of -14 mol m(-2) summer(-1) (-168 gC m(-2) summer(-1)) in a 200-y Siberian pine stand and -5 mol m(-2) summer(-1) (-60 gC m(-2) summer(-1)) in Siberian and European Russian bogs. By contrast, over the same period, a spruce forest in European Russia was a carbon source to the atmosphere of (NEE: + 7 mol m(-2) summer(-1) = + 84 gC m(-2) summer(-1)). Two years after a windthrow in European Russia, with all trees being uplifted and few successional species, lost 16 mol C m(-2) to the atmosphere over a 3-month in summer, compared to the cumulative NEE over a growing season in a German forest of -15.5 mol m(-2) summer(-1) (-186 gC m(-2) summer(-1); European flux network annual averaged - 205 gC m(-2) y(-1)).
   Differences in CO2-exchange rates coincided with differences in the Bowen ratio, with logging areas partitioning most incoming radiation into sensible heat whereas bogs partitioned most into evaporation (latent heat). Effects of these different surface energy exchanges on local climate (convective storms and fires) and comparisons with the Canadian BOREAS experiment are discussed.
   Following a classification of disturbances and their effects on ecosystem carbon balances, fire and logging are discussed as the main processes causing carbon losses that bypass heterotrophic respiration in Siberia. Following two approaches, NBP was estimated to be only about 13-16 mmol m(-2) y(-1) for Siberia. It may reach 67 mmol m(-2) y(-1) in North America, and about 140-400 mmol m(-2) y(-1) in Scandinavia.
   We conclude that fire speeds up the carbon cycle, but that it results also in long-term carbon sequestration by charcoal formation. For at least 14 years after logging, regrowth forests remain net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. This has important implications regarding the effects of Siberian forest management on atmospheric concentrations. For many years after logging has taken place, regrowth forests remain weaker sinks for atmospheric CO2 than are nearby old-growth forests.

AB The focus of current water management in drained peatlands is to facilitate optimal drainage, which has led to soil subsidence and a strong increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Dutch land and water authorities proposed the application of subsoil irrigation (SSI) system on a large scale to potentially reduce GHG emissions, while maintaining high biomass production. Based on model results, the expectation was that SSI would reduce peat decomposition in summer by preventing groundwater tables (GWTs) from dropping below -60 cm. In 2017-2018, we evaluated the effects of SSI on GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) for four dairy farms on drained peat meadows in the Netherlands. Each farm had a treatment site with SSI installation and a control site drained only by ditches (ditch water level -60 / -90 cm, 100 m distance between ditches). The SSI system consisted of perforated pipes -70 cm from surface level with spacing of 5-6 m to improve drainage during winter-spring and irrigation in summer. GHG emissions were measured using closed chambers every 2-4 weeks for CO2, CH4 and N2O. Measured ecosystem respiration (R-eco) only showed a small difference between SSI and control sites when the GWT of SSI sites were substantially higher than the control site (> 20 cm difference). Over all years and locations, however, there was no significant difference found, despite the 6-18 cm higher GWT in summer and 1-20 cm lower GWT in wet conditions at SSI sites. Differences in mean annual GWT remained low (< 5 cm). Direct comparison of measured N2O and CH4 fluxes between SSI and control sites did not show any significant differences. CO2 fluxes varied according to temperature and management events, while differences between control and SSI sites remained small. Therefore, there was no difference between the annual gap-filled net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the SSI and control sites. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was on average 40 and 30 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2017 and 2018 on the SSI sites and 38 and 34 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1 )in 2017 and 2018 on the control sites. This lack of SSI effect is probably because the GWT increase remains limited to deeper soil layers (60-120 cm depth), which contribute little to peat oxidation.
   We conclude that SSI modulates water table dynamics but fails to lower annual carbon emission. SSI seems unsuitable as a climate mitigation strategy. Future research should focus on potential effects of GWT manipulation in the uppermost organic layers (-30 cm and higher) on GHG emissions from drained peatlands.

AB The climate variability and related sea-level changes during the Holocene are still under discussion, especially in a regional context. Very little information comes from the southern and south-eastern Baltic coast. The aim of the paper is to gain insight on the history of regional environmental changes, particularly sea-level and storminess, and their driving forces. The investigations were located on a peatland on the coast of Puck Lagoon (Gulf of Gdansk, southern Baltic Sea). The analysis of peat core comprised: radiocarbon dating, analysis of stable isotopes(18)O and(13)C and chemical components, as well as palynological and diatomic studies. Results showed the 1.0 m peat section accumulated over 1500 years, with a time resolution of 100 years per sample. The average water level in the Puck Lagoon rose by ca. 0.85 m during the last 1500 years in a cyclic mode, with a period cycle of ca. 600-550 years and an amplitude not exceeding 0.5 m. The accelerated sea level rise and frequent storminess occurred during the first half of the Dark Ages (1500-1300 years b2k) and LIA (750-450 years b2k) and since the beginning of the 20th century. Recognized environmental changes are well correlated with both temperature changes in the North Atlantic and changes in total solar irradiance, suggesting synchronous Northern Hemisphere-wide fluctuations. The solar forcing was an important constituent of natural climate variability in the past and of forcing climate warming during modern times - after the Little Ice Age.

AB Peat groundwater compositions at depths of 0.4 and 1.1 m below ground surface in the Attawapiskat region of the James Bay Lowlands are evaluated for diamond exploration applications. Samples were collected along transects that typically extended at least 200 m beyond the margins of Yankee, Zulu, and Golf kimberlites. Locations of upwelling groundwater usually occur at or near kimberlite margins based on hydrogeological measurements and variations in peat groundwater geochemical parameters (pH and EC are high, and the Eh is low relative to ombrotrophic peat groundwaters). Concentrations of the kimberlite pathfinder metals Ni, Cr, light rare earth elements (LREEs), Ba, Mg/Ca, and alkalis are commonly elevated at sample sites at or near kimberlite margins and where groundwaters are upwelling. The presence of elevated kimberlite pathfinders at these sites suggests that fractures along the boundaries between kimberlites and limestone formed during kimberlite emplacement provide dilation for upward movement of groundwater with elevated kimberlite pathfinder metals. Typically, Ni, Cr, LREE, and Ba behave similarly and thus high concentrations of these metals are found at similar locations along transects. On the other hand, locations of elevated alkalis and Mg/Ca vary. The spatial variations among pathfinder metals in peat groundwaters are possibly due to geochemical processes in the peat, such as metal binding to dissolved organic material, adsorption to insoluble organics or Fe-oxyhydroxides, and incorporation into secondary mineral precipitates, which can act to increase or decrease metal solubility. The findings of this study are readily applicable in diamond exploration in wetlands elsewhere.

AB Peatlands extend over vast areas of the northern landscape. Within some of these areas, lakes and ponds are changing in size as a result of permafrost thawing and erosion, resulting in mobilization of the carbon-rich peatland soils. Our aims in the present study were to characterize the particle, carbon and nutrient regime of a set of thermokarst (thaw) lakes and their adjacent peatland permafrost soils in a rapidly degrading landscape in subarctic Quebec, Canada, and by way of fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, production measurements and an in situ enrichment experiment, determine the bacterial characteristics of these waters relative to other thaw lakes and rock-basin lakes in the region. The soil active layer in a degrading palsa (peatland permafrost mound) adjacent to one of the lakes contained an elevated carbon content (51% of dry weight), high C : N ratios (17 : 1 by mass), and large stocks of other elements including N (3% of dry weight), Fe (0.6 %), S (0.5 %), Ca (0.5 %) and P (0.05 %). Two permafrost cores were obtained to a depth of 2.77m in the palsa, and computerized tomography scans of the cores confirmed that they contained high concentrations (> 80 %) of ice. Upon thawing, the cores released nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (from all core depths sampled), and soluble reactive phosphorus (from bottom depths), at concentrations well above those in the adjacent lake waters. The active layer soil showed a range of particle sizes with a peak at 229 mu m, and this was similar to the distribution of particles in the upper permafrost cores. The particle spectrum for the lake water overlapped with those for the soil, but extended to larger (surface water) or finer (bottom water) particles. On average, more than 50% of the bacterial cells and bacterial production was associated with particles > 3 mu m. This relatively low contribution of free-living cells (operationally defined as the < 1 mu m fraction) to bacterial production was a general feature of all of the northern lakes sampled, including other thaw lakes and shallow rock-basin lakes (average +/- SE of 25 +/- 6 %). However, a distinguishing feature of the peatland thaw lakes was significantly higher bacterial specific growth rates, which averaged 4 to 7 times higher values than in the other lake types. The in situ enrichment experiment showed no difference between organic carbon or phosphorus enrichment treatments at day 5 relative to the control, however there was an apparent increase in bacterial growth rates between days 1 and 5 in the soil and the carbon plus phosphorus enrichments. Collectively these results indicate that particles, nutrients and carbon are released by degrading permafrost peatland soils into their associated thermokarst lakes, creating favorable conditions for production by particle-based as well as free-living aquatic bacterial communities. The reduced bacterial concentrations despite high cellular growth rates imply that there is control of their population size by loss-related factors such as grazing and viral lysis.

AB Climate change can be expected to increase the frequency of summer droughts and associated low water tables in ombrotrophic peatlands. We studied the effects of periodic water table drawdown in a mesocosm, experiment. Mesocosms were collected in Southern Sweden, and subsequently brought to an experimental field in the Netherlands. Two water table treatments were applied: one with constant water tables at 5 cm below the moss surface, and one in which the water table was allowed to drop, resulting in water tables fluctuating between 5 and 21 cm below the moss surface. Sphagnum growth, as well as Sphagnum and vascular plant abundance, were assessed for 21 years. Our results show that the abundance of graminoid species increased most in the constant water table treatment. In contrast, ericoid species cover increased when water tables were allowed to fluctuate. Furthermore, Sphagnum cuspidatum production decreased with fluctuating summer water tables, while Sphagnum magellanicum responded oppositely. From these results we conclude that increased occurrence of periods with low water tables may bring about a shift in dominant Sphagnum species as well as a shift from graminoid to ericoid vascular plant cover, resembling the shift from hollow to lawn or hummock vegetation. The difference in response within functional groups (vascular plants, Sphagnum) may add to the resilience of the ecosystem. (C) 2008 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Estuarial saline wetlands have been recognized as a vital role in CO2 cycling. However, insufficient attention has been paid to estimating CO2 fluxes from estuarial saline wetlands. In this study, the static chamber-gas chromatography (GC) method was used to quantify CO2 budget of an estuarial saline reed (Phragmites australis) wetland in Jiaozhou Bay in Qingdao City of Shandong Province, China during the reed growing season (May to October) in 2014. The CO2 budget study involved net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production (GPP). Temporal variation in CO2 budget and the impact of air/soil temperature, illumination intensity and aboveground biomass exerted on CO2 budget were analyzed. Results indicated that the wetland was acting as a net sink of 1129.16 g/m(2)during the entire growing season. Moreover, the values of R-eco and GPP were 1744.89 g/m(2) and 2874.05 g/m(2), respectively; the ratio of R-eco and GPP was 0.61. Diurnal and monthly patterns of CO2 budget varied significantly during the study period. R-eco showed exponential relationships with air temperature and soil temperature at 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm depths, and soil temperature at 5 cm depth was the most crucial influence factor among them. Meanwhile, temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of R-eco was negatively correlated with soil temperature. Light and temperature exerted strong controls over NEE and GPP. Aboveground biomass over the whole growing season showed non-linear relationships with CO2 budget, while those during the early and peak growing season showed significant linear relationships with CO2 budget. This research provides valuable reference for CO2 exchange in estuarial saline wetland ecosystem.

AB Sphagnum fuscum was collected from twenty-five ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peat bogs surrounding open pit mines and upgrading facilities of Athabasca Bituminous Sands (ABS) in northern Alberta (AB) in order to assess the extent of atmospheric contamination by trace elements. As a control, this moss species was also collected at a bog near Utilcuma (UTK) in an undeveloped part of AB and 264 km SW of the ABS region. For comparison, this moss was also collected in central AB, in the vicinity of the City of Edmonton which is approximately 500 km to the south of the ABS region, from the Wagner Wetland which is 22 km W of the City, from Seba Beach (ca. 90 km W) and from Elk Island National Park (ca. 45 km E). All of the moss samples were digested and trace elements concentrations determined using ICP-SMS at a commercial laboratory, with selected samples also analyzed using instrumental neutron activation analysis at the University of Alberta.
   The mosses from the ABS region yielded lower concentrations of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn compared to the moss from the Edmonton area. Concentrations of Ni and Mo in the mosses were comparable in these two regions, but V was more abundant in the ABS samples. Compared with the surface vegetation of eight peat cores collected in recent years from British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, the mean concentrations of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl and Zn in the mosses from the ABS region are generally much lower. In fact, the concentrations of these trace elements in the samples from the ABS region are comparable to the corresponding values in forest moss from remote regions of central and northern Norway.
   Lithophile element concentrations (Ba, Be, Ga, Ge, Li, Sc, Th, Ti, Zr) explain most of the variation in trace metal concentrations in the moss samples. The mean concentrations of Th and Zr are greatest in the moss samples from the ABS region, reflecting dust inputs to the bogs from open pit mines, aggregate quarries, and gravel roads. Linear regressions of V, Ni, and Mo (elements enriched in bitumen) versus Sc (a conservative, lithophile element) show excellent correlations in the mosses from the ABS region, but this is true also of Ag, Pb, Sb and Tl: thus, most of the variation in the trace metal concentrations can be explained simply by the abundance of dust particles on the plants of this region. Unlike the moss samples from the ABS region and from UTK where Pb/Sc ratios resemble those of crustal rocks, the moss samples from the other regions studied yielded much greater Pb/Sc ratios implying significant anthropogenic Pb contributions at these other sites.

AB Sphagnum cultivation on harvested peatlands to meet wetland restoration objectives could be an economically feasible activity since cultivated Sphagnum has potential horticultural applications. We compared the characteristics of cultivated Sphagnum from Shippagan (Canada) with those of non-cultivated Sphagnum products from Chile, New Zealand and Canada, and assessed its potential as a perlite and vermiculite substitute in horticultural peat-based substrates. Shippagan cultivated Sphagnum was shorter than the Chilean and New Zealand products with which it was compared, yet more similar to them than to the Canadian product currently on the market. Laboratory tests on physical properties and greenhouse growth trials indicated that 50-100 % of the perlite or vermiculite of a peat-based substrate can be successfully replaced with cultivated Sphagnum. Non-sieved coarsely shredded Sphagnum or the large (>6.3 mm) fragments of sieved coarsely shredded Sphagnum best replicated the aeration provided by perlite and vermiculite in the substrates that were tested. Decomposition tests and comparisons of changes in physical properties of substrates containing Sphagnum after six weeks of growth trials indicated that Sphagnum degradation leading to reduced substrate performance is not likely to be an issue. Therefore, cultivated Sphagnum has great potential as a substitute for perlite and vermiculite.

AB We present the results of multiproxy study of a peat deposit from Carlisle Island (the Islands of Four Mountains, Aleutians). Vegetation on the initial stage of the peat is characterized by heath vegetation dominated by Ericales indicating cold conditions at 7300-6100 cal yr BP. The appearance of Betula and Alnus is the result of long-distance transportation attributable to strong winds at this time. Sedge-grass (Cyperaceae and Poaceae) communities began replacing heath vegetation at 6100 cal yr BP because of the climatic amelioration. C/N ratios and pollen spectra remain relatively stable at 6100-2450 cal yr BP. For the CR-03 peatland, volcanic tephra contributed significantly to the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectral data. Volcanic input created overlap of an aluminosilicate signal with carbohydrate vibrations. Significant changes occurred at approximately 2450 cal yr BP when there is the some evidence of cooler and wetter conditions of the Neoglacial. High values of delta N-15 observed at 7100-7000 cal yr BP reflect the fertilizing effect of seabird nesting colonies. A decrease in delta N-15 ca. 6900 cal yr BP may indicate initial settlement on Carlisle Island corresponding with harvesting seabirds. Human predation continued until a series of volcanic eruptions, which deposited Okmok II and CR-02 tephra layers at ca. 2000 and 1050 cal yr BP, respectively.

AB To compare the ability of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) and tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) to adjust to variable edaphic conditions, as found in natural peatlands, we varied N fertilization of seedlings in a growth chamber experiment over two growing seasons and examined growth, biomass partitioning, and gas exchange. Seedlings from both species received either high N (100 mu g center dot L-1) or low N (10 mu g center dot L-1) in consecutive growing seasons as follows: (i) low N and low N (LL), (ii) low N and high-N (LH), (iii) high N and low N (HL), and (iv) high N and high N (HH). Both species had greater shoot and total dry weight after 1 year in the high-N treatment as compared with seedlings grown for 1 year under low-N. For tamarack, these differences were larger and they also exhibited a positive effect of fertilization on net assimilation and water use efficiency. Only black spruce exhibited a positive growth response following the move to higher N fertilization in the second year (LL versus LH), whereas only tamarack exhibited a negative growth response following the move to lower N fertilization (HH versus HL). Still, tamarack had greater total biomass at the end of 2 years than did black spruce, irrespective of fertilizer treatment. Both species had greater total biomass in the HL treatment than in the LH treatment. Tamarack seems able to take advantage of favorable nutrient conditions, but it also experiences more dramatic growth declines under poor or deteriorating conditions. While black spruce grows more slowly than tamarack, it is somewhat buffered from declines in growth under poor or deteriorating conditions. Each species appears to be adapted in its own way to the edaphic heterogeneity that exists in natural boreal peatlands.

AB Cattail (Typha angustifolia)-dominated temperate marshes have high productivity and are valuable resources in the prairie pothole region of the northern USA. Whereas bryophytes of peatlands have been studied extensively, bryophytes in marsh assemblages in wetlands without peat accumulation have been largely overlooked, and bryophyte contribution to productivity in these systems has not been assessed. We studied bryophyte assemblage composition and biomass productivity in restored and natural marshes in northwestern Minnesota. Bryophyte species richness was low in all marshes but increased from submerged toward upland marsh vegetation zones. Under the cattail canopy, a dense carpet of Leptodictyum riparium dominated the bryophyte assemblage. Unlike marshes in the northern prairie pothole region and eastern Great Lakes region that are dominated by species of Drepanocladus, prairie wetlands in western Minnesota were dominated by L. riparium with D. aduncus relatively uncommon. Bryophyte biomass in natural marshes was comparable to that of bryophyte-dominated peatlands and increased over time in restored marshes. Natural wetlands had higher species richness, bryophyte cover and bryophyte biomass than restored wetlands and even after 34 years, the bryophyte assemblage in restored wetlands was not comparable to natural wetlands.

AB Only a few studies have considered the N budget of peat soils and this in turn has limited the ability of studies to consider the impact of changes in climate and atmospheric deposition upon the N budget of a peat soil. This study considered the total N budget of an upland peat-covered catchment over the period 1993 to 2009. The study has shown:
   i) Over the period of study the total N atmospheric deposition declined from 3.5 to 0.7 tonnes N/km(2)/yr.
   ii) The total fluvial export of N at soil source varied from 0.41 to 1.85 tonnes N/km(2)/yr with the fluvial flux being greater than the atmospheric input in 3 years of the study, implying significant internal processing.
   iii) Measuring the C:N ratio of organic matter pools in the ecosystem shows that gross primary productivity and litter decomposition represent outputs of N from the soil while DOC production and humification represent inputs of N.
   iv) Overall, the total N budget of the peat ecosystem varies from -1.0 to +2.5 tonnes N/km(2)/yr, i.e.in some years the ecosystem is a net source of N.
   The time series of the total N budget suggests that the ecosystem is responding to the occurrence of severe droughts with a long-term decline in N storage that could be interpreted as a response to long-term high N deposition rates, even if those rates have now diminished.

AB Major earthquake uplifts in south-central Alaska of marine deltaic surfaces to an inter-tidal or supra-tidal status cause drastic shifts in processes and vegetation. To assess long-term ecosystem changes as a deltaic landscape converted from a tidal marsh to a supra-tidal wetland, we studied a four-stage chronosequence of deltaic surfaces (30-yr-old inter-tidal surface, 352-yr-old inter-tidal surface, 30-yr-old supra-tidal surface, and 280-yr-old supra-tidal surface). Plots were used to gather landform, soils, and vegetation information, and landform schematics and aerial photo interpretation were used to determine their spatial distribution. Succession progressed on inter-tidal surfaces from pioneer species (principally Carer lyngbyaei) on newly uplifted mud flats, to a mature tidal marsh with channels, levees, and basins dominated by Carer lyngbyaei with thick root mats. Uplift of the mature tidal surface to a supra-tidal status allowed freshwater tolerant species (Equisetum fluviatile, Sphagnum spp.) to invade the basins, and trees and shrubs displaced herbaceous vegetation on levees. On the oldest supra-tidal surface, basins developed peatlands (Andromeda polifolia, Sphagnum spp.), and pH decreased. Levees supported trees or shrubs on mineral or peat soils. Vegetation zonation within a basin-levee complex was evident and repeated, with some variation, across the surfaces. At the landscape scale moving inland, gradients in vegetation occurred on all surface ages.

AB Long-term effects of liming on concentrations of minerals in needles and soil water and peat soil properties in a 29-year-old Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) stand in Northern Ireland were investigated. Liming resulted in increased concentrations of P, Ca, S, Mn and Fe in the peat. It also lowered the average water-table depth during the growing season (March-September). Although the pH in the litter layer of limed plots was still high 26 years after lime application compared with unlimed plots (pH = 3.59), re-acidification of the litter layer was apparent. The pH in the below-litter layers was increased by lime application to a depth of at least 30 cm. Concentrations of Ca and S in the litter layer and top 30 cm of the peat profile and concentrations of P, Mn and Al in the litter layer and top 5 cm of the peat profile were increased by liming. In contrast, concentration of K in the litter layer and concentration of Zn in the 5-25 cm depth of the peat profile were decreased by liming. Concentration of P in needles was increased as a result of liming. Lime had no effect on soil water pH, but lime application increased concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Fe2+ and decreased concentrations of Zn2+ and Al3+ in the soil water. In February, concentration of NH4+-N in the soil water increased in plots which had received 7.5 t ha(-1) and decreased in plots which had received 22.5 t ha(-1) lime, compared with unlimed plots. Tree growth and fine-root distribution into the peat were highest in the plots which had received lime at 15 t ha(-1), and fine-root growth in these plots was higher than in the unlimed plots. Therefore, it is likely that a further application of lime at 15 t ha(-1) as the best dosage for increasing tree growth would serve to prevent soil acidification. Lime doses and time after initial lime application are important factors affecting nutrient leaching.

AB The paralic, Lower-Middle Jurassic Baga Formation of the Island of Bornholm, Denmark, was deposited in a fault-bounded, subsiding, pull-apart basin. The formation is up to 400 m thick and contains more than 50 coal seams. Twelve of these have been investigated petrographically and geochemically to provide basic information on the composition of the relatively unknown Jurassic coals. The peat-forming environments represented by the seams and the associated siliciclastic sediments are interpreted.
   The seams represent three types of environments with organic matter deposition. Feat accumulation occurred in low-lying areas situated between river channels in a coastal plain environment undergoing overall transgression. The coals have a relatively uniform, huminite-rich petrographic composition, indicating that the precursor mires were dominated by persistent, water-saturated and anoxic conditions. The swamps were probably occupied by a small-statured flora with cellulose-rich tissues. Significant bacterial activity in the peat swamps is suggested by an abundance of hopanes. Influence from marine water was not common but occurred occasionally. During peat accumulation, the depositional conditions were stable and quiet. The small thicknesses of the seams (8-57 cm thick) indicate relatively short periods of peat formation (average c. 2300 yr), due to continued base-level rise, controlled by subsidence, and an overall eustatic rise, causing repeated changes in the sedimentary regimes. The coal seams are of low rank and were buried to a depth of 1100-1200 m before uplift, due to Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary basin inversion and Neogene uplift.

AB Palaeoecological studies (including analysis of pollen, macrofossils, geochemistry, and AMS radiocarbon dates) of four peat sections from one low-centred ice-wedge polygon in NE Yakutia (NE Siberia) allow the three-dimensional reconstruction of polygon development during the last ca 1250 years. After drainage of a lake, peat forming vegetation invaded rapidly. Comparison with palaeotemperature data shows that the initial formation of mature ridges coincided with a period of high summer temperatures around AD 1400. The ridges persisted and expanded during the subsequent colder ca 200 years. Partial collapse of various ridges at the end of the 18th century corresponded to a phase with low summer temperatures. During the warm, 20th century one collapsed ridge regenerated, whereas another persisted in its collapsed state. Ice-wedge polygons are, thus, complex and highly dynamic ecosystems, in which changes in temperature and precipitation may induce rapid ecological changes by the complex interplay of water, ice and vegetation. Our study indicates that global warming associated with a decrease in summer precipitation may initially result in enhanced polygon ridge formation. The combination of longer summers and increased winter precipitation, as predicted for high latitudes will, however, eventually result in larger meltwater input in the polygon mires, which may cause the (partial) collapse of polygon ridges and underlying ice-wedges.

AB Cultivated organic soils can be a major source of GHG emissions in countries with high coverage of peat soils. Targeting mitigation measures based on mapping of cultivated organic soils would reduce these emissions and increase sustainability of agriculture. Different georeferenced datasets were combined to study the area trend and describe current agricultural use of organic soils. The area was also mapped regionally into classes based on intensity of cultivation and organic layer depth, and an example allocation of potential mitigation measures was made at the country scale. The area and proportion of cultivated organic soils have increased in Finland since 1990 but the clearance rate has decreased in recent years. More than half of the area retains a peat layer deeper than 0.6 m indicating long-lasting mitigation potential with measures capable of slowing peat decomposition. Sixty-five percent of the cultivated organic soil area was not considered a priority area for radical management changes, for various reasons, but there are 85,000ha of field with more realistic potential for GHG mitigation. The mapping method was found to be a practical tool for depicting the GHG mitigation potential of cultivated organic soils. Significant reductions in agricultural GHG emissions can be expected with implementation of the suggested mitigation measures.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between vascular plant production and CH4 emissions from an arctic wet tundra ecosystem in north-east Greenland. Light intensity was manipulated by shading during three consecutive growing seasons (1998-2000). The shading treatment resulted in lower carbon cycling in the ecosystem as mean seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) decreased from 336 to -196 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and from -476 to -212 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 1999 and 2000, respectively, and total ecosystem respiration decreased from 125 to 94 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 1999 and from 409 to 306 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 2000. Seasonal mean CH4 emissions in controls and shaded plots were, respectively, 6.5 and 4.5 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in 1999 and 8.3 and 6.2 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in 2000. We found that CH4 emission was sensitive to NEE and carbon turnover, and it is reasonable to assume that the correlation was due to a combined effect of vegetative CH4 transport and substrate quality coupled to vascular plant production. Total aboveground biomass was correlated to mean seasonal CH4 emission, but separation into species showed that plant-mediated CH4 transport was highly species dependent. Potential CH4 production peaked at the same depth as maximum root density (5-15 cm) and treatment differences further suggest that substrate quality was negatively affected by decreased NEE in the shaded plots. The concentration of dissolved CH4 decreased in the control plots as the growing season progressed while it was relatively stable in the shaded plots. This suggests that a progressively better developed root system in the controls increased the capacity to transport CH4 from the soil to the atmosphere. In conclusion, vascular plant photosynthetic rate and subsequent allocation of recently fixed carbon to belowground structures seemed to influence both vegetative CH4 transport and substrate quality.

AB The origin of the organic matter (OM) and the characteristics of the depositional environment of lignites from the Upper Miocene Kovin deposit (hosting three coal seams) of Serbia were evaluated based on petrographic data, bulk organic geochemical parameters, biomarker analysis and stable isotope geochemistry (delta C-13 of individual biomarkers). Samples were collected from four boreholes, GD-601 and GD-603 (the "A" field), and KB-79 and KB-91 (the "B" field), representing different parts of coal seams I, II, and III.
   Investigated lignites are typical humic coals. The OM of lignites is derived from woody vegetation and herbaceous peat-forming plants, with prevalence of the former in most samples. Peat-forming vegetation is characterized by abundant decay resistant gymnosperm (coniferous) plants, followed by a low amount of angiosperms. Lignite forming plants mostly belonged to the gymnosperm families Cupressaceae, Taxodiaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Slight input of ferns, fungi and aquatic macrophyta to lignite OM is also evident. Distributions of hopanoids and isotopic compositions of these biomarkers reflect the activity of various microbial populations represented by methanotrophic-, chemoautotrophic- and heterotrophic bacteria during diagenesis. Prominent C-28 28,30-bisnorneohop-13(18)-ene was observed for the first time in the lignite extracts. According to the delta C-13 value it was probably derived from chemoautotrophic bacteria. C28 28,30-bisnorneohop-13(18)-ene could be one of the possible precursors of a series of orphan aromatic hopanoids bearing an ethyl group at C-21, via progressive aromatization.
   Peatification proceeded in a fresh water environment under variable redox conditions, from anoxic to slightly oxic. All three coal seams are heterogeneous. The lower parts of the coal seams represent a topogenous fresh water peat mire with open water areas, which was subjected to inundations. The upper parts of coal seams represent a wet forest swamp with relatively stable conditions. Despite the observed variations in all three coal seams, the mean values of petrographic and organic geochemical parameters suggest general increasing of wetness and establishment of more stable conditions from seam III to seam I. Maceral and biomarker data indicate that rapid flooding of the bogs stopped peat growth in all three coal seams.
   Relatively frequent variations in all three coal seams, followed by repetition of lignite characteristics depict well the pronounced seasonality e.g. short term cycles of the climate during Late Miocene in investigated area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The gradually accumulation of nutrients in organic substrates during growing season may have adverse effects on plant development. This study was conducted to determine the mode of nutrient accumulation and alteration at molecular level induced by the excess nutrient stress in tomato. The ICP-MS was used to analyze mineral ions in root zone solution and nutrients uptake by tomato plants; and iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis was conducted to identify proteome changes in tomato roots. Coir and peat-vermiculite were used in substrate treated experiments. Results showed that the content of K+ was higher in coir than in peat-vermiculite whereas it was the opposite for Ca2+. The concentrations of NO3-, SO42- and Mg2+ were significantly higher in peat-vermiculite and coir substrates than in water culture. The peat-vermiculite substrates generally enhanced Ca uptake but reduced P uptake by plants, when compared to both coir and water culture. Compared to water culture, functional annotation analysis of the root proteome revealed that the excess nutrient accumulation induced complex proteomic alterations involved in mineral ion binding and transport. A total of 358 differentially abundant proteins (DAPS) were identified, including 11 mineral ion binding and transport related proteins, such as calmodulin-like protein and nitrate transporter 3.2 under peat-vermiculite and coir cultivations. RT-qPCR was used to validate nine genes encoding DAPS. We believe that these indicators will contribute to a better control of soilless culture systems and a waste reduction in production of tomatoes.

AB Coal petrologic and mineralogic investigations, along with proximate and Rock-Eval pyrolysis, were performed on samples from a borehole in the center of the Karlovo basin in order to determine the depositional environment of the Karlovo lignite, which formed during the transgressive stage of a tectonic graben. Several thin coaly layers represent the transition from a fluvio-deltaic to a lacustrine environment, but only the uppermost lignite seam, which is about 10-m thick, is considered (sub-) economic. The latter is characterized by medium to high ash yields and low sulfur contents.
   The coal formed in a rheotrophic, low-lying mire near a freshwater lake with low pH value. The acid environment resulted in low bacterial activity, low gelification, and low sulfur contents. Alumosilicates were altered to kaolinite, another consequence of the acidic peat water.
   During peat accumulation areas with open water existed in the central basin. Alginite-rich sapropelic sediments with (acidophilic) diatoms accumulated in these anaerobic ponds. Apart from the basin center, xylitic coal indicates a vegetation rich in decay resistant conifers (swamp forest). Relatively dry conditions were established during later peat-forming stages. This is indicated by lower ash yields and increased contents of fusinite and fungal remains. Peat accumulation was terminated by a major flooding event and the establishment of a lake.

AB The Zoige peatland is the largest alpine peatland in the world, and it is suffering the threat of water table decline. Plant productivity and species composition are important to ecosystem carbon sequestration and soil carbon input in peatlands. We examined the responses of plant community composition and biomass accumulation to water table decline to better understanding the responses of this peatland to environmental changes. A four-year in situ field experiment was conducted involving three treatments: deep, shallow, and control water tables, which were achieved by experimental drainage with 50 cm, 20 cm, and 0 cm deep ditches, respectively. Experimental drainage decreased the annual mean height of water table by ca. 12 cm and 15 cm (relative to the control) in the shallow and deep water table treatments, respectively, over the four years. The response of aboveground plant biomass (APB) to water table decline declined in the first year, remained unchanged in the second year and increased during the third and fourth years. However, water table decline had a non-significant effect on belowground plant biomass. This duration-dependent response of APB can be attributed to the changes in community species composition during the study years. Specifically, the negative effect of water table decline in the first year was due to the significant decrease in APB of hygrophytes (sedges and rushes). In the second year, although water table decline significantly increased APB of mesophytes (grasses and forbs), this increase was offset by the decrease in APB of hygrophytes, leading to a neutral effect. In both the third and fourth years, the extent of the increase in APB of mesophytes (typically the forb species Anemone trullifolia var. linearis) was greater than that of the decrease in APB of hygrophytes, leading to a positive effect. Our results indicate that short-term decline of the water table may increase the primary productivity by shifting dominant species of hygrophytes to mesophytes in the Zogie peatland.

AB In the boreal zone, large areas of natural mires have been drained and used for agriculture, resulting in net carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions and increased nitrous oxide emissions but decreased methane emissions. However, due to structural changes in agriculture, a substantial area of cropland on organic soil has been afforested. In order to estimate the carbon balance of afforested organic-soil cropland, we measured CO, and water vapour (H 20) fluxes during year above a Scots pine plantation (Pinus sylvestris) in the middle-boreal zone, using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method. We observed CO2 uptake by the Scots pine stand from late April to mid-October with a daily average net uptake from May to the beginning of October. However, there were also periods of daily net efflux. High ecosystem respiration rates continued throughout the winter (mean winter respiration 0.036 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). As an annual average, the 30-year-old pine stand was a small source of CO2 (+50 g m(-2) a(-1)) to the atmosphere, showing that the CO2 sequestration into the ecosystem was able to compensate for most of the carbon that was released by heterotrophic respiration from the drained soil.

AB [1] This study analyzed controls on evapotranspiration (E) from a western Siberian bog, from a perspective that surface constraints limit the E available for atmospheric evapotranspiration demands. Ratios of E to potential evapotranspiration (E-P) ranged from 0.2 to 0.9, and were clearly related to changes in surface constraints represented by the bulk transfer coefficient for latent heat C-E (= betaC(H) where beta is the surface moisture availability and CH is the bulk transfer coefficient for sensible heat). Both E-P and equilibrium evaporation (E-EQ) showed similar seasonal trends, suggesting the importance of radiation to the seasonal variation of E-P. The atmospheric drying power (E-a) was a minor factor in E-P and showed less seasonal change during most of the growing season. However, the presence of a dry air mass caused by synoptic scale advection (most frequently observed in May 1999) significantly enhanced E-a; consequently, the seasonal maximum of E-P occurred earlier than the seasonal maximum of E-EQ. Values for C-H (0.004-0.011) increased with leaf area index except Sphagnum moss (LAI(g)), indicating that vegetation growth contributes to changes in bog roughness through canopy height changes. The beta value gradually decreased with decreases in the water table position (z(wt)); the open water surface area and water content of Sphagnum moss depended on z(wt). Furthermore, the absence of a significant relationship between beta and phenology implies that changes in evaporation contribute to variations in E more than changes in transpiration. Hence roughness change created by vegetation growth and surface wetness limit evapotranspiration to less than the potential evapotranspiration.

AB Monthly mean sink/source strength pattern of a degraded temperate peatland in northwestern Turkey was quantified using the eddy covariance technique between July 2010 and February 2014. Atmospheric and hydrological drivers and responses to extreme events of sink/source strength were analysed using multiple linear regression models, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron with principal component analysis and multiple comparisons following general linear models. On the basis of the three full-year measurements, mean annual, growing season and maximum estimates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) were -0.22mg CO2 m(-2)s(-1), -0.28mg CO2 m(-2)s(-1) and -0.11mg CO2 m(-2)s(-1) in July, respectively. The main driver of changes in monthly mean NEE pattern was found to be latent heat flux. Independent validation results showed a similar predictive performance (r(2)=74%) of multiple linear regression and support vector machine models as a function of month, total rainfall, water table depth, relative humidity, latent heat, atmospheric water vapour, wind direction and downwelling shortwave radiation. A shift in NEE from a net sink to a net source was observed in response to the deepest and shallowest water table depths due to drought and flooding, respectively.

AB High latitude wetlands play an important role for the surface-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), but fluxes of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) in these ecosystems have to date not been extensively studied. This is despite BVOC representing a measurable proportion of the total gaseous C fluxes at northern locations and in the face of the high temperature sensitivity of these systems that requires a much improved process understanding to interpret and project possible changes in response to climate warming. We measured emission of isoprene and photosynthetic gas exchange over two growing seasons (2005-2006) in a subarctic wetland in northern Sweden with the objective to identify the physiological and environmental controls of these fluxes on the leaf scale. The sedge species Eriophorum angustifolium and Carex rostrata were both emitters of isoprene. Springtime emissions were first detected after an accumulated diurnal mean temperature above 0 degrees C of about 100 degree days. Maximum measured growing season standardized (basal) emission rates (20 degrees C, 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were 1075 (2005) and 1118 (2006) mu g Cm-2 (leaf area) h(-1) in E. angustifolium, and 489 (2005) and 396 (2006) mu g Cm(-2)h(-1) in C. rostrata. Over the growing season, basal isoprene emission varied in response to the temperature history of the last 48 h. Seasonal basal isoprene emission rates decreased with leaf nitrogen (N), which may be explained by the typical growth and resource allocation pattern of clonal sedges as the leaves age. The observations were used to model emissions over the growing season, accounting for effects of temperature history, links to leaf assimilation rate and the light and temperature dependencies of the cold-adapted sedges.

ID SEPARATION
AB Capillary electrophoresis was used for the separation of humic acid (HA) from peat, soil, and vermicompost. The electropherograms show the presence of at least three peaks eluted between 6 and 11 min for all HA. The best analysis resolution was obtained with the use of berate buffers at pH 8.9. The HA analyzed have structural and charge similarity, which increases the difficulty of separation. Therefore, the shape of the peaks is broad and the CE profiles of all HA are similar, it is reasonable to assume that the broad band in the three regions is due to the acidic groups that have a similar structure. By comparing the results obtained for HA extracted from soil, peat, vermicompost, and the commercial sample, HA from peat had the major carbon content.

AB In patches of co-occurring species in natural plant communities, there is a finely poised balance between species in the ways in which they respond to prevailing moisture and temperature regimes. However, environmental change scenarios, in which temperature, moisture and ultraviolet-B radiation are suggested to increase, may favour one of the species. The imbalance is likely to occur at the levels of interactions between patches of the different species and at the shoot level when neighbouring shoots belong to different species. We increased temperature and UV-B in a two-way factorial experiment and increased water supply independently in two subarctic mire communities dominated by the mosses Sphagnum fuscum and Dicranum elongatum. The effects of simulated increase in UV-B were Studied using two separate radiation systems, i.e. a "square wave" system and a "modulated" system.
   When precipitation was enhanced, both species showed an increase in growth but this was not sustained beyond 5 mm per day. S.fuscum showed a 50% greater response to enhanced precipitation than did D. elongatum, as would be expected from their habitat preferences. Under ambient temperature, S.fuscum grew 67% faster than D. elongatum and this relative difference in response was maintained after one year under a temperature enhancement. The response by species over the winter period was moderated by their neighbours. S.fuscum growth was enhanced when it grew next to D. elongatum whereas D. elongatum grew better with neighbours of its own species. Increased temperature and UV-B radiation did not affect the interaction between the species.
   Although a balance was maintained between the two species over the short duration of the experiment, potential was shown for all imbalance to occur over longer periods and particularly if winter warming and precipitation Lire greater than those in summer.
   During the peak growing season 20% increased UV-B over ambient had a negative effect oil S. fuscum under increased temperature but there were no overall seasonal effects on either species, irrespective of method of UV supplementation.

AB Restoring degraded peat soils presents an attractive, but largely untested, climate change mitigation approach. Drained peat soils used for agriculture can be large greenhouse gas sources. By restoring subsided peat soils to managed, impounded wetlands, significant agricultural emissions are avoided, and soil carbon can be sequestered and protected. Here, we synthesize 36 site-years of continuous carbon dioxide and methane flux data from a mesonetwork of eddy covariance towers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA to compute carbon and greenhouse gas budgets for drained agricultural land uses and compare these to restored deltaic wetlands. We found that restored wetlands effectively sequestered carbon and halted soil carbon loss associated with drained agricultural land uses. Depending on the age and disturbance regime of the restored wetland, many land use conversions from agriculture to restored wetland resulted in emission reductions over a 100-year timescale. With a simple model of radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetimes, we showed that restored wetlands do not begin to accrue greenhouse gas benefits until nearly a half century, and become net sinks from the atmosphere after a century. Due to substantial interannual variability and uncertainty about the multi-decadal successional trajectory of managed, restored wetlands, ongoing ecosystem flux measurements are critical for understanding the long-term impacts of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation.

AB Alpine wetland is a source for methane (CH4), an important greenhouse gas, but little is known about how this habitat influences the emission. To understand this wetland habitats were selected at the altitude of 3430 m a.s.l. (in National Wetland Nature Reserve of Zoige, Quingle - Tibetan Plateau) and the methane flux was measured with static chambers in three different sites, including hollows with Carex muliensis Hand - Mazz. and Eleocharis valleculosa Ohwi f. setosa (Ohwi) Kitagawa., grass hummocks composed of Kobresia tibetica Maxim, Cremanthodium pleurocaule R. D. Good, Potentilla bifurca L. and Pedicularis sp. We have found that in alpine wetland these habitats significantly affect CH, emissions in the onset (April, 2006) and peak (August, 2005) stages of growing season. Hollows covered with Carex muliensis and Eleocharis valleculosa had higher values of emission than grass hummocks built by several grass species. Slight difference of CH4 emission was found between two kinds of hollows with Carex muliensis and Eleocharis valleculosa. These results were consistent with the change of water table, which was found best correlated with CH4 emissions (r(2) = 0.43, P <0.01) in the peak stage of growing season. Directly measured shoot biomass and plant heights were best related to CH4 emissions (r(2) = 0.59, P <0.01). However, in the onset stage of growing season, variation of CH4 emission may not be simply ascribed to changes in water table and vegetation structure.

AB Three radiocarbon-dated pollen diagrams were made from progressively shallower depths on a transect through an upland stream-valley bog in South Wales. The pear ranges in age from approximately 4000 to 2500 cal. BP. Comparison of the pollen diagrams shows that local vegetational changes can be distinguished and different histories emerge at sites only tens of metres apart. Despite this, general trends can be distinguished. There is evidence of increased soil moisture and the growth of willows as organic material began to accumulate in the central part of the valley around 4000 cal. BP. Reduction of trees accompanied true blanket peat inception, perhaps around 3800 cal. BP. At the margin, however, tree reduction preceded the peat formation which began at least 1000 years later. The process was here accompanied by podsolization. Some woodland remained near the site until the end of the Bronze Age. There was an increase of soil moisture during, or close to the end of, Romano-British times. An increase of healthy ground cover occurred around 350-700 cal. BP but there was a reversion to more grassy conditions in relatively recent times. There is little evidence of human impacts. The vegetational and soil changes at the site appear to be attributable principally to climatic deterioration or local hydrological changes.

AB Peatlands are key reservoirs of belowground carbon (C) and their monitoring is important to assess the rapid changes in the C cycle caused by climate change and direct anthropogenic impacts. Frequently, information of peatland area and vegetation type estimated by remote sensing has been used along with soil measurements and allometric functions to estimate belowground C stocks. Despite the accuracy of such approaches, there is still the need to find mappable proxies that enhance predictions with remote sensing data while reducing field and laboratory efforts. Therefore, we assessed the use of aboveground vegetation attributes as proxies to predict peatland belowground C stocks. First, the ecological relations between remotely detectable vegetation attributes (i.e. vegetation height, aboveground biomass, species richness and floristic composition of vascular plants) and belowground C stocks were obtained using structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM was formulated using expert knowledge and trained and validated using in-situ information. Second, the SEM latent vectors were spatially mapped using random forests regressions with UAV-based hyperspectral and structural information. Finally, this enabled us to map belowground C stocks using the SEM functions parameterized with the random forests derived maps.
   This SEM approach resulted in higher accuracies than a direct application of a purely data-driven random forests approach with UAV data, with improvements of r(2) from 0.39 to 0.54, normalized RMSE from 31.33% to 20.24% and bias from -0.73 to 0.05. Our case study showed that: (1) vegetation height, species richness and aboveground biomass are good proxies to map peatland belowground C stocks, as they can be estimated using remote sensing data and hold strong relationships with the belowground C gradient; and (2) SEM is facilitates to incorporate theoretical knowledge in empirical modeling approaches.

AB Due to modern life with increasing traffic, industrial production and agricultural practices, high amounts of heavy metals enter ecosystems and pollute soil and water. As a result, metals can be accumulated in plants and particularly in algae inhabiting peat bogs of low pH and high air humidity. In the present study, we investigated the impact and intracellular targets of aluminum, copper, cadmium, chromium VI and zinc on the filamentous green alga Desmidium swartzii, which is an important biomass producer in acid peat bogs. By means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) it is shown that all metals examined are taken up into Desmidium readily, where they are sequestered in cell walls and/or intracellular compartments. They cause effects on cell ultrastructure to different degrees and additionally disturb photosynthetic activity and biomass production. Our study shows a clear correlation between toxicity of a metal and the ability of the algae to compartmentalize it intracellularly. Cadmium and chromium, which are not compartmentalized, exert the most toxic effects. In addition, this study shows that the filamentous alga Desmidium reacts more sensitively to aluminum and zinc when compared to its unicellular relative Micrasterias, indicating a severe threat to the ecosystem.

TI A 1000-year reconstruction of summer precipitation from Ireland:
   Calibration of a peat-based palaeoclimate record

AB Calibration of proxy climate records is well-established for annually resolved proxies such as tree rings, but it has not been attempted for non-annually resolved proxies such as those from peatland surface wetness records. Several previous studies have suggested that peatland surface wetness is primarily driven by warm season moisture balance and implied a potential for producing calibrated records of deficit or precipitation. This paper presents a high-resolution testate amoebae analysis of a peat record from central Ireland covering the last c.1000 years, and provides the first attempt to produce a calibrated record of past precipitation from a peat record. Past water table depth was reconstructed using a transfer function applied to contiguous samples for the top 1 m of the profile. The chronology was constrained by a series of radiocarbon ages (including 'bomb-spike' ages) and spheroidal carbonaceous particles. Correlations between reconstructed water tables and meteorological records (1958-1995) of precipitation and deficit were strongly positive and were used to reconstruct precipitation and deficit from the last 1000 years. Validation using earlier meteorological records was hampered by very low peat accumulation rates, but suggested the summer precipitation and deficit reconstructions were more robust than a reconstruction of annual precipitation. The summer precipitation reconstruction suggests that the period AD1400-1850 experienced higher summer rainfall than for much of both the preceding 400 years and the last 150 years. The change in regime from low to high summer rainfall may be attributed to changes in the summer North Atlantic Oscillation. Combined with tree ring and speleothem records of winter NAO, this suggests a major change in seasonality of precipitation in far western Europe between the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. The MCA was characterised by dry summers and wet winters, whilst the LIA had wet summers and dry winters. Calibration of peat surface wetness records using meteorological records holds much potential for the future and may lead to improved insights into seasonal precipitation and water balance changes. This study was limited by slow accumulation rates leading to low temporal resolution for the late 19th and early 20th century part of the record. Further development of the technique will require more highly temporally resolved records of change over the whole of the instrumental time period to allow a full calibration and validation approach to be applied.

ID TRACE-ELEMENT DEPOSITION; HYLOCOMIUM SPLENDENS; MOSS SAMPLES; BIOMONITOR
AB The temporal trends in atmospheric deposition of some heavy metals in Norway are presented and discussed on the basis of two different approaches: The use of moss samples during the last 25 years to monitor atmospheric deposition, and the analysis of peat cores to study long time trends. Deposition surveys based on moss sampling have been carried out 5 times since 1977, each time covering nearly 500 sites all over the country. The southernmost part is particularly exposed to V, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Pb, and Bi due to long-range transport from source areas elsewhere in Europe. Deposition of these elements however has declined substantially over this period. In the case of Pb the 2000 level is less than 10% of that in 1977. Long-term trends have been studied by means of dated peat cores from 6 ombrotrophic bogs in different part of the country, covering a period of about 3000 years. The elements typical of long-range atmospheric transport show quite coherent depth distributions in the peat. Stable lead isotope ratios indicate that air pollution was the dominant source of lead deposition during the entire period.

AB Holocene climate dynamics have strongly influenced precipitation patterns in the Eastern Mediterranean region. This holds particularly true for the '8.2 kyr BP climatic event', arguably the strongest perturbation of early to mid-Holocene climate. Here we present a biomarker record of leaf wax-derived n-alkane distributions and stable isotopic composition of total organic carbon (delta C-13(TOC)) along with palynological data from the fen peat archive of Tenaghi Philippon (TP), NE Greece, spanning the interval from 8.7 to 7.5 kyr BP. Our record documents the response of in situ vegetation within the Philippi peatland to changing hydrological conditions, and addresses the applicability of organic proxies such as the 'aquatic index' (P-aq), average chain length (ACL) and delta C-13(TOC) as indicators of peat surface moisture conditions at the study site. The long chain n-alkanes (n-C-27, n-C-29 and n-C-31) typical of vascular terrestrial plants, dominated the peat sequence. A period of relatively dry surface conditions, indicated by low values of P-aq and elevated ACL values, in concert with elevated delta C-13(TOC) values, preceded the 8.2 kyr BP climatic event from ca. 8.7 to 8.2 kyr BP. Slightly wetter, more humid conditions, suggested by an increase in P-aq as well as reduced ACL and delta C-13(TOC) values, characterized the interval of the 8.2 kyr BP climatic event. Notably, the increase in surface wetness, as indicated by the biomarker record, coincided with a marked rise in fern spore proportion as well as increasing proportion of pollen from aquatic taxa. Following the 8.2 kyr BP event, a distinct change in paleohydrology at TP became apparent from ca. 7.9 kyr BP onward. An increase in the abundance of the mid-chain length n-alkanes (n-C-23 and n-C-25), indicative of an increased contribution from aquatic plants to the sediment, together with a steep increase in P-aq and a decrease in ACL, as well as variation in delta C-13(TOC), imply considerably elevated surface moisture levels, likely caused by the increased activity of the karstic system of the surrounding mountains. Collectively, the biomarker proxies and pollen data reveal a concise picture of changing moisture conditions at TP in response to the 8.2 kyr BP climatic event. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We studied the effect of long-term water table drawdown on the vascular plant community in an ombrotrophic bog in central Finland by measuring aboveground biomass and belowground production (by in-growth cores) across plant functional groups including herbs, shrubs, and trees. We compared drained and undrained portions 45 years after the installation of a drainage ditch network, which has lowered water levels of 15-20 cm on average in the drained part of the site. Although shrub fine root production did not differ significantly between sites, water table drawdown increased belowground tree fine root production by 740% (3.8 +/- A 5.4 SD and 28.1 +/- A 24.1 g m(-2) y(-1) in undrained and drained sites, respectively) at the expense of herb root production, which declined 38% (27.62 +/- A 16.40 and 10.58 +/- A 15.7 g m(-2) y(-1) in undrained and drained sites, respectively) yielding no significant overall change in total fine root production. Drainage effects on aboveground biomass showed a similar pattern among plant types, as aboveground tree biomass increased dramatically with drainage (79 +/- A 135 and 2546 +/- A 1551 g m(-2) in drained and undrained sites, respectively). Although total shrub biomass was not significantly different between sites, shrubs allocated more biomass to stems than leaves in the drained site. Drainage also caused a significant shift in shrub species composition. Although trees dominated the aboveground biomass following water table drawdown, understorey vegetation, mainly shrubs, continued to dominate belowground fine root production, comprising 64% of total root production at the drained site. Aboveground biomass proved to be a good predictor of belowground production, suggesting that allometric relationships can be developed to estimate belowground production in these systems. Increase in tree root production can counteract decrease in herb fine root production following water table drawdown, emphasizing the importance of plant functional type responses to water table drawdown. Whether these changes will offset ecosystem C loss via increased plant C storage or stimulate soil organic matter decomposition via increased above- and belowground litter inputs requires further study.

AB On numerous occasions, rhizosphere microbial activities have been identified as a key factor in metal phytoavailability to various plant species and in phytoremediation of metal-contaminated sites. For soil bioremediation efforts in heavy metal contaminated areas, microbes adapted to higher concentrations of heavy metals are required. This study was a field survey undertaken to examine rhizosphere microbial communities and biogeochemistry of soils associated with Zn accumulation by indigenous willows (Salix purpurea L.) in the naturally metalliferous peat soils located near Elba, NY. Soil and willow leaf samples were Collected from seven points, at intervals 18 m apart along a willow hedgerow, on four different dates during the growing season. Soil bacterial community composition was characterized by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and a 16S clone library was created from the rhizosphere of willows and soils containing the highest concentrations of Zn. Bacterial community composition was correlated with soil sulfate, but not with soil pH. The clone library revealed comparable phylogenetic associations to those found in other heavy metal-contaminated soils, and was dominated by affiliations within the phyla Acidobacteria (32%), and Proteobacteria (37%), and the remaining clones were associated with a wide array of phyla including Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteriodetes, and Cyanobacteria. Diverse microbial populations were present in both rhizosphere and bulk soils of these naturally metalliferous peat soils with community composition highly correlated to the soil sulfate cycle throughout the growing season indicative of a sulfur-oxidizing rhizosphere microbial community.

ID GROWTH
AB The reuse of substrates for more than one growing season is an excellent alternative to reduce production costs and to improve the sustainability of the ornamental plant production system. The objectives of the present trial were to study the effects of substrate reuse on Lilium var. Helvetia plants cultivated in shipping crates in a polyethylene greenhouse, as well as possible changes in the physical and physical-chemical properties of the substrates employed. Peats used during two and three cultivation cycles and new unused peat were tested. The reused substrate reduces the particle fraction with higher diameter size, porosity, and organic matter and increases particle bulk and substrate carbon (C) / nitrogen (N) ratio, due to the substrate decomposition. However, it does not affect flowers, flower stems and leaves, and dry and fresh matter. The level of phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) in leaf, as well as nitrate, potassium (K), and Mg in the substrate solution are similar among the three kinds of substrates studied. Nevertheless, the substrate used for three cultivation cycles leads to increases in organic N and K and decrease of calcium in leaves.

AB The studied objects represent the lacustrine bottom deposits in the southeast of the Kola Peninsula and the peat bed in the Cape Rybachii, exemplifying the northernmost occurrence of this substance in the European part of Russia. A detailed radiocarbon dating and palynological analysis provided grounds to establish the Holocene chrono- and climatostratigraphy of the region and to correlate the studied sections with coeval deposits in Scandinavia. Sedimentation in the lakes commenced in the region 11000-10000 years ago. The pine species spread over the Kola Peninsula 9000-7000 years ago. The peat accumulation was initiated here 8000-7500 years ago. The birch tundra forests advanced up to the Parents Sea coast 6000-5000/4500 years ago. The northern forest boundary retreated southward after the climate deteriorated 4500 years ago. When the pine forest areas decreased, peat bogs became more widespread in the southeastern Kola Peninsula, and the tundra belt appeared at the coast of the Parents Sea. Spruce trees arrived at their northern distribution limit in the peninsula about 3500 years ago. The current structure of the vegetation cover was formed during the last 2500-2000 years.

DE Cynodon dactylon; management; peatland restoration; soil moisture; soil

AB Lake Hula and its neighbouring peatland in the upper Galilee, Israel were drained during the 1950s. For about 40 years after drainage most of the area was under continuous intensive cultivation with rain-fed winter crops and irrigated summer crops. In 1994 an area of about 110 ha of mainly peat soil was re-flooded and 350 ha surrounding it were partly taken out of intensive agricultural use. The surrounding area was still cultivated under rain-fed conditions in the cool winter season, but left fallow during the hot, dry summer. The summer vegetation was mowed periodically to promote the development of a continuous sward cover for recreation and control of wind erosion. The goal of this research was to study the relationship between dynamic changes in the soil and water conditions and the composition and species distribution of the spontaneous summer vegetation. During four consecutive years the vegetation dynamics were characterised by increasing dominance of Cynodon dactylon and Sorghum halepense. Cyperus rotundus, which was common under irrigated cultivation, partly disappeared under the new non-irrigated regime. The density and growth rate of the vegetation mainly reflected differences in the water table depth, which varied between 0.5 m and 3 m. Three years after re-flooding, soil salinity was high in areas where the water table was higher than 0.5 m and in dry patches where almost no cover of vegetation was found. In these sites the concentration of mineral nitrogen (N-NO3 and/or N-NH4) was especially high. A continuous vegetation cover developed on the peat soil in areas where the depth of the water table was between 1 m and 2 m. Mowing the vegetation periodically in summer suppressed the growth of tall, weedy species and promoted the dominance of Cynodon dactylon creating a dense, productive sward.

   technique; soil temperature
AB Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission was measured from mires in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, by using a static chamber technique during free snow-covered periods. The seasonal mean emission of CH4 was 12.4mg/(m(2).h) and the emission range of CO2 was 8.7-16.6g/(m(2).d) (gross CO2 flux) during plant growth period. CO2 emission rate in the day was stronger than that at night, and the daily peak appears at 19:00. The mire plants in the Sanjiang Plain begin to sprout at the end of April. The aboveground biomass of the mire plants increased from zero to the peak from July to September and showed single peak form. The aboveground biomass of Carex lasiocarpa (464.8g/m(2)) was lower than that of Deyeuxia platyphylla (530.8g/m(2)), but the underground biomass was higher than that of Deyeuxia platyphylla. Gross CO2 flux showed the significance positive correlation relationship with plant biomass. Gross CO2 flux and CH4 emission were also correlated with soil temperature (0-5cm) and water temperature. However, the highest CH4 emission rate lagged behind the highest soil temperature in the root area during plant growth period. The data also indicated that wet and warm conditions during the early spring led to greater value of CH4 emission flux. Inundation is the necessary condition for the existence of methane bacteria, but there is no significant positive correlation between the inundation depth and CH4 emission rate in this region. Within the same growing season and under the same inundation condition, the variations of CH4 emission rate could be markedly different.

AB Ecological restoration is increasingly used to reverse degradation of rare ecosystems and maintain biological diversity. Pollinator communities are critical to maintenance of plant diversity and, in light of recent pollinator loss, we tested whether removal of invasive glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus L.) from portions of a prairie fen wetland altered plant and pollinator communities. We compared herbaceous plant, bee, and butterfly abundance, diversity, and species composition in buckthorn invaded, buckthorn removal, and uninvaded reference plots. Following restoration, we found striking differences in plant and pollinator abundance and species composition between restored, unrestored, and reference plots. Within 2 years of F. alnus removal, plant species diversity and composition in restored plots were significantly different than invaded plots, but also remained significantly lower than reference plots. In contrast, in the first growing season following restoration, bee and butterfly abundance, diversity, and composition were similar in restored and reference plots and distinct from invaded plots. Our findings indicate that a diverse community of mobile generalist pollinators rapidly re-colonizes restored areas of prairie fen, while the plant community may take longer to fully recover. This work implies that, in areas with intact pollinator metapopulations, restoration efforts will likely prevent further loss of mobile generalist pollinators and maintain pollination services. On the other hand, targeted restoration efforts will likely be required to restore populations of rare plants and specialist pollinators for which local and regional species pools may be lacking.

AB In this study, we describe the seasonal variation in C-13 abundance in the litter of two Sphagnum species and four vascular plant species during 3 years of field decomposition in an Italian alpine bog. Litter bags were periodically retrieved at the end of summer and winter periods, and the delta C-13 in residual litter was related to mass loss, litter chemistry, and climatic conditions. In Sphagnum litter, higher rates of decomposition during summer months were associated with an increase of delta C-13 probably due to the incorporation of microbial organic compounds rich in C-13 in the residual litter. In the litter of Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex rostrata and Calluna vulgaris, we observed a decrease of delta C-13 with an increase in the concentration of lignin-like compounds. The residual litter of Potentilla erecta showed a decrease of C-13 abundance during the first 2 years, but on proceeding the decomposition, the delta C-13 increased again probably reflecting the incorporation of microbial organic compounds.

AB The morphology, productivity and C/N-balance of 9 different clones of Phragmites australis planted in 1997 in a degraded fen area of 40,000 m(2) was investigated in order to estimate the degree of variation between the genotypes. The planted reed clones showed significant differences in morphology, standing crop and stand structure at the same site. The above-ground biomass of some reed clones was due to high culms and large leaf areas, while among others it was due to high shoot densities and small culms. The productivity of the individual clones also differed. At the end of the 1998 growing season the standing crop of the clones ranged from about 700 to 2,000 g of dry matter per m(2). Differences were found in the C/N-dynamics as in the standing stock of total nitrogen in the above-ground biomass (ranging from 15 to 50 g N/m(2)) and the relative nitrogen content of the shouts. Furthermore, seasonal changes in the amount of free amino acids and carbohydrates in the basal internodes of the different clones were compared. The patterns are discussed with respect to the nutritional status of the reed plants. In conclusion, the results suggest high genotypic variation despite the comparable site conditions and thus a strong influence of generically determined differences in growth and resource exploitation on the characteristics of reed clones.

AB Peat mined from endangered wetland ecosystems is generally used as a component in soilless potting media in horticulture but is a costly and non-renewable natural resource. The objective of this work was to study the feasibility of replacing peat with different percentages (0, 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%) of composted green waste (CGW) as growth media for the production of the ornamental plant Calathea insignis. Compared with 100% peat media, media containing CGW had improved physical and chemical characteristics to achieve the acceptable ranges. Moreover, CGW addition had increased the stability (i.e., reduced the decomposition rates) of growth media mixtures, as indicated by comparison of particle-size distribution at the start and end of a 7-month greenhouse experiment. Addition of CGW also supported increased plant growth (biomass production, root morphology, nutrient contents, and photosynthetic pigment contents). The physical and chemical characteristics of growth media and plant growth were best with a medium containing 70% CGW and were better in a medium with 100% CGW than in one with 100% peat media. These results indicate that CGW is a viable alternative to peat for the cultivation of Calathea insignis.

AB Methane flux was measured, employing the micrometeorological eddy correlation technique, during two growing seasons (1991 and 1992) in a peatland in Minnesota. As compared to 1991, the 1992 season was wetter and cooler Here we examine the seasonal distributions of CH4 flux and the relationship between concurrently measured CH4 and CO(2)fluxes. Midday CH4 flux was low (1.5 mg m(-2) h(-1)) during late May in both seasons. Subsequently, the flux ranged from 2.5 to 5.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) during early June to early July in both years. Methane flux peaked at 6.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) during mid July in 1991. The peak flux (8.0 mg m(-2) h(-1)) in 1992 occurred 3 weeks later. A sustained drop in water table during late July to late August in 1991 may have reduced the methane emission. During mid August-mid October in 1992, the water table was consistently high and the flux ranged from 2.0 to 3.0 mg m(-2) h(-1). As compared to 1991, CH4 flux during this time in 1992 was higher by about 1.0 mg m(-2) h(-1) because of the overriding influence of the water table. Integration over the growing season (late May to mid October), indicated that this ecosystem released approximately 10.4 and 11.5 g C m(-2) of CH4 in 1991 and 1992, respectively.
   We examined our concurrent measurements on methane flux and canopy photosynthesis under a variety of environmental conditions from different parts of the growing season. On a time scale of the entire season, the overall patterns of methane flux and canopy photosynthesis were similar in both years. Canopy photosynthesis, however, showed large day-to-day changes in response to variations in temperature and moisture. Corresponding changes in methane flux during these selected periods were relatively small. The slopes and correlation coefficients of linear regressions between methane flux and photosynthesis data varied widely. Accordingly, a close coupling between short-term (day to day) variations in methane flux and canopy photosynthesis was not evident.

AB This experiment evaluated the influence of manure, peat, and vermiculite incorporated at low and high rates (0.0118 and 0.0236 m(3)/m(2)) and under two soil moisture regimes on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedling (1+0 for 1+1) xylem water potential (Psi(xylem)), whole-plant plant growth, root architectural development, and subsequent field performance under fertilized and non-fertilized conditions. Trends in soil moisture retention were observed (high manure > high peat > control) but there were no differences in Psi(xylem). Root length in the wetter soil moisture experiment was initially (three months) greatest for seedlings in high vermiculite and least in high manure but there were no differences among treatments at lifting (eight months). Mean height was greatest for seedlings grown in vermiculite and peat (wetter nursery experiment) after two field seasons. Field fertilization (35 g/seedling) with controlled-release fertilizer in the planting hole stimulated height growth initially, but decreased height and diameter growth during the second growing season. Dramatic improvements associated with the use of nursery soil amendments were not realized, but the failure to identify negative effects, a potential reduction in disease incidence, and improvement of nursery soil physical and chemical properties may justify their use.

AB Deposit modelling based on archived borehole logs supplemented by a small number of dedicated boreholes is used to reconstruct the main boundary surfaces and the thickness of the main sediment units within the succession of Holocene alluvial deposits underlying the floodplain in the Barking Reach of the Lower Thames Valley. The basis of the modelling exercise is discussed and the models are used to assess the significance of floodplain relief in determining patterns of sedimentation. This evidence is combined with the results of biostratigraphical and geochronological investigations to reconstruct the environmental conditions associated with each successive stage of floodplain aggradation. The two main factors affecting the history and spatial pattern of Holocene sedimentation are shown to be the regional behaviour of relative sea level and the pattern of relief on the surface of the sub-alluvial, Late Devensian Shepperton Gravel. As is generally the case in the Lower Thames Valley, three main stratigraphic units are recognised, the Lower Alluvium, a peat bed broadly equivalent to the Tilbury III peat of Devoy (1979) and an Upper Alluvium. There is no evidence to suggest that the floodplain was substantially re-shaped by erosion during the Holocene. Instead, the relief inherited from the Shepperton Gravel surface was gradually buried either by the accumulation of peat or by deposition of fine-grained sediment from suspension in standing or slow-moving water. The palaeoenvironmental record from Barking confirms important details of the Holocene record observed elsewhere in the Lower Thames Valley, including the presence of Taxus in the valley-floor fen carr woodland between about 5000 and 4000 cal BP, and the subsequent growth of Ulmus on the peat surface.

AB Peatbogs have both horizontal and vertical differences in moisture, pH, light and nutrient availability. Micro-distribution of testate amoebae taxa has been observed along the Sphagnum stem but there is no data concerning the vertical micro-distribution of protozoa in water column under the peatbog surface and in the interstitial waters.
   The research was made in a small (ca 16 ha) peatbog complex in the eastern Poland. Vertical microzonation of testate amoebae and ciliates in relation to physical, chemical and biological parameters (peat porosity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, TN, TP, DOC and TOC) in Sphagnum hollows, mud bottom hollows and interstitial waters in peatbog were studied. Samples were taken once a month from April to November 2009 from three layers: free water mass up to 10 cm (FW), bottom water (BW) and interstitial, pore water - IW (water between particles of peat on depth 20-25 cm). During each sampling occasion 3 samples were collected from each site. At each type of micro-habitat and each sampling date water was sampled using a plexiglass core. The water column sampled from the top surface to the bottom was 25 cm high. Interstitial waters were collected from mini-piezometers located into the peat. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, chlorophyll a and nutrients contents were always lower in interstitial water than in free and bottom waters. The highest numbers of testate amoebae and ciliates taxa occurred in the bottom water (31 and 13 taxa, respectively) and became much lower in interstitial water (17 and 5 taxa, respectively). The density and biomass of protozoa differed significantly between the studied layers, with the lowest numbers in the interstitial water and the highest in the bottom water. Ordination analysis indicated that chlorophyll a, TOC and TP can strongly regulate the abundance and species composition of protozoa. The RDA ordination showed that the testate amoebae species can be divided into three groups associated with: 1) free water mass, 2) bottom water and 3) interstitial water, while the ciliate species into two groups associated with: 1) interstitial water and 2) free water mass and bottom waters. The free water mass and bottom water were dominated by mixotrophic taxa, whereas the deepest layer showed the increase of the contribution of small, bacterivorous species. In all the examined micro-habitats the highest abundance and biomass of these microorganisms occurred in early spring and late autumn, while the lowest values were recorded in late summer.

AB The increased nitrogen (N) availability caused by climate warming and associated permafrost thawing would affect the carbon (C) sequestration in high latitude ecosystems, especially in boreal peatlands. However, the effect of N availability on C mineralization of soil, especially at depths, was not sufficiently understood. In this study, we collected boreal peatland soils at different depths in Northeast China and investigated soil organic C (SOC) mineralization with three N addition levels (control: 0 mg N.g(-1) soil; low N: 0.04 mg N.g(-1)soil; high N: 0.08 mg N.g(-1)soil) in a short laboratory experiment. The results showed that after 66d incubation the total SOC mineralization as well as the percentage of initial SOC mineralization mainly decreased at depth and they were evidently correlated with initial water content, pH, and total phosphorus (P) content. N addition suppressed SOC mineralization in subsurface (30-100 cm) soil layers, and the suppression was significant at 70-80 cm and 90-100 cm depths. N addition tended to enhanced SOC mineralization in surface (0-30 cm) soil layers, and the stimulation effect was significant at 20-30 cm depth. In conclusion, our results suggested that N addition did not affect SOC mineralization significantly at 0-100 cm depths; some initial soil characteristics were the major factors that control SOC mineralization at depth.

AB The Lower-Middle Jurassic succession on the island of Bornholm, Denmark, comprises a wide range of clastic depositional environments: lacustrine, fluvial, coastal plain, tidal flat and shallow marine. The succession contains a number of coal seams and carbonaceous seams, permitting: (1) evaluation of the relationship between the different clastic environments and the associated environments of organic matter deposition and (2) assessment of facies changes within coal/carbonaceous seams from different peat-forming environments.
   Coal petrographic facies analysis was performed by maceral analysis of 61 coal samples from the Lower Jurassic Ronne Formation, comprising the Munkerup Member, Sose Bugt Member and Galgelokke Member, and from the upper Lower-Middle Jurassic Baga Formation. The seams in the Munkerup Member and the Sose Bugt Member are mainly allochthonous, whereas those of the Galgelokke Member and the Baga Formation are mainly autochthonous. The seams represent a broad spectrum of depositional environments; from raised bogs to freshwater swamps and marine-influenced swamps. The facies are subaquatic to telmatic and terrestrial. Compositional differences between the seams are attributed to vegetation characteristics, depositional facies and differences in the degradation of the organic matter. The original peat-forming vegetation was composed of cellulose rich, shrub-like plants, tree ferns, herbaceous plant communities and a varying amount of trees.
   The peat-forming environments represented by the carbonaceous seams in the Munkerup and Sose Bugt Members are compatible with the depositional environments indicated by the sediments. However, the coal seam in the Galgelokke Member represents deposition in a raised bog, conflicting with sedimentary interpretation of a clastic tidal flat environment for the member. The Baga Formation is considered to have formed under a lower/upper delta plain or fluvial environment. The composition of the coal seams supports the interpretation of a system of meandering streams in a upper delta plain to fluvial environment.

TI Nitrous oxide fluxes from grassland in the Netherlands .2. Effects of
   soil type, nitrogen fertilizer application and grazing
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID DENITRIFICATION
AB Intensively managed grasslands are potentially a large source of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the Netherlands because of the large nitrogen (N) input and the fairly wet soil conditions. To quantify the effects of soil type, N-fertilizer application and grazing on total N2O losses from grassland, fluxes of N2O were measured weekly from unfertilized and mown, N fertilized and mown, and N fertilized and predominantly grazed grassland on a sand soil, a clay soil, and two peat soils during the growing season of 1992.
   Total N2O losses from unfertilized grassland were 2.5-13.5 times more from the peat soils than from the sand and clay soils. Application of calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer significantly increased N2O flux on all sites, especially when the soil was wet. The percentage of fertilizer N applied lost to the atmosphere as N2O during the season ranged from 0.5 on the sand soil to 3.9 on one of the peat soils. Total N2O losses were 1.5-2.5 times more from grazed grassland than from mown grassland, probably because of the extra N input from urine and dung. From 1.0 to 7.7% of the calculated total amount of N excreted in urine and dung was emitted as N2O on grazed grassland. The large N2O losses measured from the peat soils, combined with the large proportion of grassland on peat in the Netherlands, mean that these grasslands contribute significantly to the total emission from the country.

AB Moorlands on blanket bog are high-priority ecosystems from a conservation viewpoint in the British Isles; they are often managed through using prescribed burning to increase their productivity for sheep and Red grouse. However, there is an increasing demand to conserve these moorlands for other environmental services, e.g. carbon sequestration and water supplies. There is, therefore, a need for experimental evidence on the role that fire and fire-rotation intervals have on these moorlands ecosystems for the development of ecologically-sound management plans. Here, the impact of prescribed burning on the propagule banks was evaluated at two contrasting geographical moorland locations differing in productivity, climate and past pollution history. Two different approaches were used; chronosequences of elapsed time since burning and a long-term replicated grazing and burning experiment (1954-2010) where different burning rotations were applied. The propagule banks in both moorlands were very species-poor and the species present were mainly common ones. The chronosequences showed that few species had significant effects with elapsed time since burning; the dominant Calluna vulgaris increased in the above-ground litter fraction which acted as a barrier to seed transfer to the underlying peat. Within the experiment, the seed bank of C vulgaris and the frequency of occurrence of Sphagnum species increased as rotation-interval increased. It is suggested that prescribed burning rotations simultaneously at two temporal scales within a moorland landscape may be needed to conserve Sphagnum species, short-rotation burns (every 10-years) to enhance its abundance in the vegetation and long-rotations (>55 years) to maintain Sphagnum propagules in the surface peat.

AB A core from an ombrotrophic Swiss bog representing 12 370 C-14 years of peat accumulation was evaluated as a possible archive of atmospheric deposition of Mo, Th and U. Calcium, Sr, and Ba were also determined to quantify weathering inputs, Mn to follow possible redox transformations, and Rb to identify plant uptake. Each of these elements was determined using ICP-MS, following digestion in a microwave heated autoclave using 3 ml HNO3 and 0.1 ml HBF4. Calcium and Sr clearly identify the thickness of the ombrotrophic zone because they are enriched in the minerogenic zone relative to the concentration of mineral matter. The concentration of Ba, however, is proportional to the concentration of mineral matter in all samples, and is not added to peat column by weathering reactions at the peat-sediment interface. The lowest element concentrations are found during the Holocene climate optimum (5320 to 8030 C-14 year BP) with the following natural background values (n = 18): Mo 0.08 +/- 0.02 mug g(-1), U 0.029 +/- 0.008 mug g(-1), Ba 5.2 +/- 2.6 mug g(-1), Th 0.070 +/- 0.022 mug g(-1) and Rb 0.63 +/- 0.09 mug g(-1). By far the highest concentrations of Ba, Mn, Rb and Th were found during the Younger Dryas cold climate event (10 590 C-14 year BP) when the flux of atmospheric soil dust was at its post-glacial maximum. Molybdenum and U are elevated in concentration throughout the minerogenic zone because of sediment weathering and this masks the atmospheric signal in samples older than ca. 8000 C-14 year BP (ca. 9000 calendar years). Enrichment factors (EF) calculated using Sc as a conservative, lithogenic element shows that minerogenic peats are enriched in Mo up to 18 x and U 26 x, relative to the natural "background'' values. During the two millennia prior to industrialisation, the accumulation rate of atmospheric Mo averaged 0.23 +/- 0.13 mug m(-2) year(-1). With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, Mo accumulation rates rapidly and continuously increased to approximately 10 mug m(-2) year(-1) in the late 1980s. These data suggest that Mo in atmospheric aerosols today is derived predominately from anthropogenic emissions. Uranium does not show the same enrichment pattern which suggests that steel-making rather than coal combustion is the primary source of atmospheric Mo contamination at this site.

AB The Ronne Formation, which crops out on the southern coast of the Danish island of Bornholm, consists of coal-bearing siliciclastic strata. A major feature in these sediments is successions of different types of stacked palaeosol profiles beneath coal seams of varying thickness'  The most obvious and diagnostic properties of these palaeosols are the occurrence of fossil roots and the colour of the horizons penetrated by roots. Three types of palaeosol profiles represent an association of soils that developed on the ancient, tidally influenced lower deltaic plains. Low relief areas were characterized by hydromorphic conditions due to poor drainage. This resulted in the development of waterlogged Gleysols in backswamp areas, and less acid Histosols in closed bays of coastal swamps. In the latter case peat-bogs were formed. In topographically higher areas, as levee banks and crevasse splays, freely drained Podzols developed. This soil-type was dominated by kaolinite in the clay fraction. promoted by acid leaching.
   The morphology and geochemistry of all palaeosols were controlled by the position of the ground-water table, topography. climate, and rate of subsidence. In the Podzol profiles occasional flooding resulted in the formation of spodic B horizons. accumulated close to the contemporaneous water-table of that time. The organic-rich top horizons of the Podzol and Histosols profiles acted as a geochemical barrier and trapped various elements, Litter decomposition by microorganisms in these soils resulted in a concentration of potassium at the surface, thus giving an opportunity to form illite. The presence of siderite in the peat-bogs suggests that reducing conditions prevailed here at the tine of their formation.
   The soils were formed in a humid tropical climate. This is indicated by the overall leaching pattern on cations in the Podzols and Histosols, the accumulation of peat in the Histosols, and the fossil flora.

AB The CoupModel was used to simulate a Norway spruce forest on fertile drained peat over 60 years, from planting in 1951 until 2011, describing abiotic, biotic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 and N2O). By calibrating the model against tree ring data a "vegetation fitted" model was obtained by which we were able to describe the fluxes and controlling factors over the 60 years. We discuss some conceptual issues relevant to improving the model in order to better understand peat soil simulations. However, the present model was able to describe the most important ecosystem dynamics such as the plant biomass development and GHG emissions. The GHG fluxes are composed of two important quantities, the spruce forest carbon (C) uptake, 413 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and the decomposition of peat soil, 399 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . N2O emissions contribute to the GHG emissions by up to 0.7 g N m(-2) yr(-1), corresponding to 76 g C m(-2) yr(-1) . The 60-year old spruce forest has an accumulated biomass of 16.0 kg C m(-2) (corresponding to 60 kg CO2 m(-2)). However, over this period, 26.4 kg C m(-2) (97 kg CO2 eq m(-2)) has been added to the atmosphere, as both CO2 and N2O originating from the peat soil and, indirectly, from forest thinning products, which we assume have a short lifetime. We conclude that after harvest at an age of 80 years, most of the stored biomass carbon is liable to be released, the system having captured C only temporarily and with a cost of disappeared peat, adding CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB The effect of different densities of Lumbricus rubellus on the nematode community was studied in a field experiment. The stand, a cultivated meadow on peat-muck soil developed from moderately decomposed alder peat, was located on drained fens in the central basin of the Biebrza valley in the north-eastern part of Poland. Samples were taken from soil isolators into which 0, 2, 4 or 6 earthworms were previously introduced. The abundance and trophic structure of the nematode fauna in the different treatments were compared 30, 60, 90 and 120 d after the introduction of L. rubellus. The effect of L rubellus on soil nematodes was most pronounced at the beginning of the experiment. Thirty days after introduction of L. rubellus, the total number of nematodes in all trials with earthworms was significantly lower than in the control, and nematode numbers decreased with increasing L. rubellus density. On later sampling dates, the results were less clear and 120 d after introduction of L. rubellus no significant effect on the total number of nematodes was observed in the treatments. The abundance of the bacterial-, fungal- and plant-feeding nematodes in the treatments with earthworms was lower than in the control 30 d after introduction of L. rubellus, but significant differences were found only in the case of bacterial feeders.

AB The long-term effects of high nitrogen supply on the growth and partitioning of biomass in a common sedge species, Carer rostrata Stokes, were studied in a greenhouse experiment Special attention was paid to free amino acids and soluble sugars, representing biochemically available fractions of nitrogen and carbon, respectively, in the tissues of Carer. Plants were grown in peat in buckets, and nitrogen was added as ammonium nitrate (2, 5, and 10 g N m(-2) year(-1)) five times during two growing seasons. Changes in biomass allocation patterns became evident towards the end of the second growing season. The biomass of shoots was highest in the high-N treatment, resulting in a high ratio of aboveground to belowground biomass. The high biomass of shoots was due to both the high density of current-year shoots and later senescence in the high-N treatment. No differences were observed in the belowground biomasses. Changes in allocation patterns were accompanied by changes in the soluble fractions of carbon and nitrogen. The concentration of free amino acids (FAA) was significantly higher (both shoots and roots) and the concentration of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) lower (roots only) in the high-N treatment. The concentration of total nitrogen also increased with increasing supply of nitrogen. The results indicate that a high long-term supply of nitrogen may shift the internal carbon to nitrogen balance of Carer towards higher availability of nitrogen. Compared with the carbon to nitrogen ratio, the TNC:FAA ratio seems to be a better indicator of the internal carbon to nitrogen balance. A low TNC:FAA ratio may enhance the allocation of biomass to shoots and also increase the density of shoots.

AB The temporal growth pattern, above- and below-ground biomass allocation of Eriophorum vaginatum (cottongrass) and its nutrient immobilisation dynamics were studied in a greenhouse experiment. The temporal growth pattern was also studied in a field experiment with three N and P addition levels in a restored peatland buffer in central Finland. The greatest seasonal increase in accumulated N and P occurred in roots and stems and leaf sheaths concurrently with the highest leaf elongation and new daughter tiller production. The amounts of N and P immobilised in cottongrass tissues were 73 g N m(-2) (91% of the added N) and 13 g P m(-2) (77% of the added P). A remarkable liberation of P into outflow water was observed at the end of the growing period. The annually increasing mass of dead organs of cottongrass, typically highly resistant to decomposition, forms a potential long-term sink for nutrients.

AB Given the continuing concern about rising concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream water leaving peat-covered catchments, this study has considered the impact of managed burning or cutting of Calluna vulgaris, a dominant vegetation cover in many UK peatlands. Pristine mature Calluna stands were compared with those that had been subject to cutting and or managed burning up to 5years after intervention. The study measured the DOC concentration of both soil and surface runoff water over a period of 12months in comparison with water table depth, conductivity, and pH. The results show the following: The depth to the water table decreases upon both burnt and cut sites relative to controls in line with a change in evapotranspiration due to loss of vegetation. The DOC concentration of surface runoff water was not significantly different (P<0.05) between any of the treatments and the control. The DOC concentration in soil water significantly (P<0.05) decreased with both burning and cutting, but these differences could be explained by differences in water table and changes in flowpath through the soil profile. The study suggests that declines in soil water DOC concentration are brought about as different levels in the peat profile become the dominant source of water due to changes in the depth to water table. Changes in the depth to water table were brought about by changes in evapotranspiration that result from the loss of vegetation. The changes in water table mean that this mechanism may explain other observations of DOC concentration change with management. Cutting and burning may represent a management intervention that could be effective at reversing the current trends in DOC transfers from peat-covered catchments.

AB New pollen and macrofossil data are presented from three peat mires in the Central Forest State Biosphere Reserve, southern Valdai Hills (Russia). Significant changes were recorded in the vegetation during the Late Glacial and the Holocene, caused by climate changes. Three main stages of wetland development, clearly determined in the southern Valdai Hills, were attributed to the Boreal, the onset of Subboreal, and the last two centuries. Intensive peat accumulation and forest paludification were induced by increasing humidity as a result of shifts in precipitation/evaporation Fate and, probably, of cooling and increased rainfall. Evidence of agricultural activity in places in the vicinity of the territories with traditional land use is preserved in pollen records since 2500 C-14 BR However, the forest ecosystems of the Reserve were not significantly disturbed by anthropogenic activity until the last 200-150 years. Effective agriculture was possible in the southern Valdai Hills only from the 18th century. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB When conducted in tandem, organic petrography and isotopic analyses can be used to interpret regional tectonics and palaeoclimate within a global context. As an example, a sequence of lignite (vitrinite reflectance average = 0.27%) in the Lower Cretaceous Yimin Formation, Inner Mongolia, China, was investigated. The study area is within the intracratonic Hailar Basin and was situated at similar to 45 degrees N palaeolatitude. Globally warm temperatures allowed temperate to tropical vegetation such as ferns, cycads and gymnosperms to form thick, laterally extensive palaeomires within the basin. Probabilistic assessment indicates that the lower, thick (similar to 40 m) Seam #16 may have accumulated over a time span between 174 (P10) to 481 (P90) thousand years, whereas the thin (similar to 6 m) overlying Seam #16 Upper took between 20 (P10) and 96 (P90) thousand years. Thermal sag processes were active in the basin during these time periods, with subsidence rates balanced to allow enough accommodation space to accumulate thick peat, but not so fast as to induce flooding and burial by clastics. A high proportion of fossil charcoal (`inertinite') in both seams indicate that throughout the peat-forming period, fire was an important part of the mire ecology. This is consistent with global high oxygen content and an in-land continental palaeogeographic position with seasonal precipitation. Stable isotopes of carbon indicate periods of high precipitation but also times of significant relative dryness. The palaeoclimatic conditions are likely to be both seasonal as well as longer term, possibly decadal to millennium in scale and would have occurred over the whole region, not just mire specific.

AB Mangrove swamps accumulate a significant amount (45-98 %) of organic carbon in sediments; however, there is a knowledge gap in explaining the mechanism behind this. Through the analysis of substrate samples from a red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) swamp in southwest Florida, USA, this study investigated whether the "enzymic latch", which suppresses decomposition in northern peatlands, is prevalent in mangrove soils. Laboratory analyses were performed to investigate the four hypotheses of the "enzymic latch". Results showed that under aerobic conditions mangroves soil samples have significantly higher phenol oxidase activity (two-fold, p< 0.05), but lower phosphatase activity (-33 %, p< 0.05), beta-glucosidase activity (-14 %) and glucosaminidase activity (-11 %) compared to anaerobic conditions. Soil samples supplemented with phenol oxidase showed significantly lower phenolic concentration (-8.3 %, p< 0.01), but increased beta-glucosidase (+79 %, p< 0.05), xylosidase (+ 99 %, p< 0.01) and glucosaminidase (+ 102 %, p< 0.01) activities. Supplementation of lignin-based solution significantly lowered beta-glucosidase (-55 %, p< 0.001), sulphatase (-82 %, p< 0.001) and glucosaminidase (-45 %, p< 0.01) activities. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the "enzymic latch" is highly likely to play a key role in suppressing decomposition rates in red mangrove covered areas of mangrove swamps.

AB 1. Changing temperature regimes and precipitation patterns in the Subarctic will impact on vegetation composition and diversity including those of bryophyte and lichen communities, which are major drivers of high-latitude carbon and nutrient cycling and hydrology.
   2. We investigated the relative importance of such impacts at different temporal, spatial and plant functional scales in subarctic Sphagnum fuscum-dominated peatlands, comprising both an in situ warming experiment and natural climatic and topographic gradients in northern Sweden and Norway. We applied multivariate analyses to investigate the relationships among cryptogam and vascular plant species composition and abiotic (temperature, moisture) and biotic (Sphagnum growth) regimes at various scales.
   3. At the short-term temporal scale (4-year warming experiment), increased temperature yielded no clear effect on cryptogam or vascular plant species composition. Spatially, direct effects of temperature were decisive for overall species composition across regions (macro-scale) rather than within one region (meso-scale). Moisture and Sphagnum growth were drivers of species composition at all spatial scales, and Sphagnum growth itself depended on its position on the microtopographic gradient and on temperature.
   4. Grouping of bryophytes and lichens at increasing scales of functional aggregation from species, growth form to the major higher taxon level (Sphagnum, other mosses, liverworts, lichens) revealed mostly increasing correlation with climate regimes and Sphagnum growth. Excluding liverworts from the analysis tended to reduce the correlation.
   5. Abundances of lichens, liverworts, non-Sphagnum mosses and (to a lesser degree) vascular plants were negatively related to Sphagnum abundance. Few cryptogam and vascular plant species showed a positive relationship with Sphagnum abundance. Correspondingly, cryptogam species richness and Shannon Index on peatlands strongly declined as Sphagnum abundance increased, while indices for vascular plants showed no significant relationship.
   6. Synthesis. Scale, be it spatial or functional, strongly determined which environmental drivers showed the clearest relationships with vegetation composition and diversity. Our findings will help to optimize predictions about long-term effects of climate on peatland vegetation composition, and subsequently its feedbacks to carbon and water cycles, at the regional scale.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from farmed organic soils can have a major impact on national emission budgets. This investigation was conducted to evaluate whether afforestation of such soils could mitigate this problem. Over the period 1994-1997, emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were recorded from an organic soil site in Sweden, forested with silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), using static field chambers. The site was used for grazing prior to forestation. Soil pH and soil carbon content varied greatly across the site. The soil pH ranged from 3.6 to 5.9 and soil carbon from 34 to 42%.
   The mean annual N2O emission was 19.4 (+/- 6.7) kg N2O-N ha(-1) and was strongly correlated with soil pH (r = -0.93, P < 0.01) and soil carbon content (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). The N2O emissions showed large spatial and temporal variability with greatest emissions during the summer periods. The site was a sink for CH4 (i.e. -0.8 (+/- 0.5) kg CH4 ha(-1) year(-1)) and the flux correlated well with the C/N ratio (r = 0.93, P < 0.01), N2O emission (r = 0.92, P < 0.01), soil pH (r = -0.95, P < 0.01) and soil carbon (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). CH4 flux followed a seasonal pattern, with uptake dominating during the summer, and emission during winter.
   This study indicates that, because of the large N2O emissions, afforestation may not mitigate the GHG emissions from fertile peat soils with acidic pH, although it can reduce the net GHG because of greater CO2 assimilation by the trees compared with agricultural crops.

   ORIGIN
AB n-Alkane distributions are frequently used as palaeoclimate proxies in ombrotrophic peat deposits. Although n-alkane distributions differ strongly between plant species, n-alkanes are not species-specific molecules. For a proper interpretation, it is important to understand the different abundances of n-alkanes in various plant species as well as the changes that occur when plant litter is transformed to peat. In particular because molecular markers are especially valuable in highly decomposed peat where plant remains are no longer recognizable, it is important to understand the effects of decomposition on n-alkane distributions.
   The organic matter (OM) of a high-resolution sampled, 9 m thick, ombrotrophic peat deposit from Tierra del Fuego was analysed with pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC/MS). The same samples were analysed for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content. Depth profiles of C:N ratio, the summed lignin and summed polysaccharide pyrolysis products, and markers specific for Sphagnum spp., Empetrum rubrum and Nothofagus antarctica, enabled a reconstruction of changes in vegetation composition to be made. This reconstruction was used to examine the validity of the n-C-23 alkane to indicate Sphagnum and the summed long chain n-alkanes (C-29 and C-31) to reflect leaf input of the woody species E. rubrum and N. antarctica.
   Our results show that even in Sphagnum-dominated peat, the n-alkane distribution is not determined by Sphagnum but by leaf input of E. rubrum and N. antarctica. However, good correlations between the n-C-23 alkane and the Sphagnum marker 4-isopropenylphenol, and between the summed n-C-29 and n-C-31 alkanes and the marker of N. antarctica support that their relative change with depth can be used to indicate the abundance of these species in Sphagnum-dominated peat. In peat with relatively low contributions of Sphagnum, both n-alkane proxies (C-23 and C-29 + C-31) reflect the degree of decomposition. We evaluated the influence of Sphagnum dominance, decomposition, and pyrolysis on the n-alkane distributions in peat OM. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soils in the northern circumpolar region play a central role in the global carbon cycle because the release of carbon through permafrost thaw and geomorphological disturbances can potentially cause a feedback on climate. However, large uncertainties in estimates of permafrost carbon stocks remain, mainly because of wide gaps in the spatial coverage of soil carbon sampling sites and the large mapping polygons used to upscale data. By combining mapping of landforms and knowledge of surficial geology to upscale soil carbon content measurements, we provide an assessment of soil total carbon content in the region of the Narsajuaq river valley (Nunavik, Canada) to generate the first highesolution soil carbon estimate confirmed by field measurements in Nunavik. We estimate that the Narsajuaq river valley and the surrounding uplands have a weighted average of 3.4 kg C m(-2) (0-100 cm), with 73% of the total carbon content stored in the top 30 cm. The results also indicate that the valley is a carbon hotspot in the region, containing 76% of the total carbon content (0-100 cm) of the study area. Although soil carbon estimates will always require field sampling, the geomorphological mapping approach can significantly improve carbon content estimates and provide better inputs for models.

AB Emissions of b ogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from dry ecosystems at high latitudes respond strongly to small increases in temperature, and warm canopy surface temperatures drive emissions to higher levels than expected. However, it is not known whether emissions from wetlands, cooled by through-flowing water and higher evapotranspiration show similar response to warming as in drier ecosystems. Climate change will cause parts of the Arctic to experience increased snow fall, which delays the start of the growing season, insulates soil from low temperatures in winter, and increases soil moisture and possibly nutrient availability. Currently the effects of increasing snow depth on BVOC emissions are unknown. BVOC emissions were measured in situ across the growing season in a climate experiment, which used open top chambers to increase temperature and snow fences to increase winter snow depth. The treatments were arranged in a full factorial design. Measurements took place during two growing seasons in a fen ecosystem in west Greenland. BVOC samples collected by an enclosure technique in adsorbent cartridges were analysed using gas chromatography -mass spectrometry. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) was measured with a closed chamber technique, to reveal any immediate effect of treatments on photosynthesis, which could further influence BVOC emissions. Isoprene made up 84-92% of the emitted BVOCs. Isoprene emission increased 240 and 340% due to an increase in temperature of 1.3 and 1.6 degrees C in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Isoprene emissions were 25 times higher in 2015 than in 2014 most likely due to a 2.4 degrees C higher canopy air temperature during sampling in 2015. Snow addition had no significant effect on isoprene emissions even though GEP was increased by 24%. Arctic BVOC emissions respond strongly to rising temperatures in wet ecosystems, suggesting a large increase in arctic emissions in a future warmer climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents new information on the hydrology and water quality of the eroding peatland headwaters of the River Severn in mid-Wales and links it to the impact of plantation conifer forestry further down the catchment.
   The Upper Hafren is dominated by low-growing peatland vegetation, with an average annual precipitation of around 2650 mm with around 250 mm evaporation. With low catchment permeability, stream response to rainfall is "flashy" with the rising limb to peak stormflow typically under an hour. The water quality is characteristically "dilute"; stormflow is acidic and enriched in aluminium and iron from the acid organic soil inputs. Baseflow is circum-neutral and calcium and bicarbonate bearing due to the inputs of groundwater enriched from weathering of the underlying rocks. Annual cycling is observed for the nutrients reflecting uptake and decomposition processes linked to the vegetation and for arsenic implying seasonal water-logging within the peat soils and underlying glacial drift. Over the decadal scale, sulphate and nitrate concentrations have declined while Gran alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon and iron have increased, indicating a reduction in stream acidification.
   Within the forested areas the water quality is slightly more concentrated and acidic, transgressing the boundary for acid neutralisation capacity as a threshold for biological damage. Annual sulphate and aluminium concentrations are double those observed in the Upper Hafren, reflecting the influence of forestry and the greater ability of trees to scavenge pollutant inputs from gaseous and mist/cloud-water sources compared to short vegetation. Acidification is decreasing more rapidly in the forest compared to the eroding peatland possibly due to the progressive harvesting of the mature forest reducing the scavenging of acidifying inputs. For the Lower Hafren, long-term average annual precipitation is slightly lower, with lower average altitude, at around 2520 mm and evaporation is around double that of the Upper Hafren.

AB A record of high-latitude (79-degrees-55'N) Eocene polar vegetation is preserved on Axel Heiberg Island, Canadian High Arctic, in megafloras in an alternating sequence of swamp-coal, fluvio-lacustrine shale and channel-sand lithofacies of the upper coal member of the Buchanan Lake Formation. Some exposures of the swamp facies contain significant fossil forests represented by autochthonous assemblages of mummified in-situ tree stumps and forest-floor leaf-litter mats. Exposed trunks within a single coal layer represent multiple stands of trees killed and buried at the different times over 500-2000 yr. Stratigraphic examination of peat and coal megafossil floristics of the ''level N'' fossil forest at the centimetre-scale demonstrates small-scale changes in forest composition and swamp hydrology horizontally, and temporal variation vertically within this layer. A mosaic of taxodiaceous swamp (Metasequoia dominant with or without Glyptostrobus), a mixed coniferous community, and Alnus/fern bog appears to have produced both the leaf mats and the in-situ stumps, with the taxodiaceous swamp the dominant peat-accumulating phase. Taxodiaceous layers are interpreted as areas of standing water which may have experienced seasonal water-level fluctuations. Alnus/fern (with or without other broadleaved angiosperms) communities reflect areas of slightly higher peat and hence locally lower water tables, but may also reflect successional processes. The areal extent and position of these different hydrologically-controlled plant communities appears to have changed throughout the interval of accumulation of the peat layer examined.

AB To provide new insights into microbial functions in the Kushiro Wetland, Japan, we measured vertical profiles of fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (total microbial activity), beta-glucosidase and xylosidase (organic matter decomposition), acid phosphatase (phosphate production) and potential denitrifying (denitrification) activities as microbial enzyme activities in soil to depths of approximately 1.5 m from two sites with different vegetation in November 2008 (winter) and August 2009 (summer). Active organic matter decomposition, phosphate production and denitrification were evident in shallow litter and peat layers, and total microbial activity was high. Almost no differences in decomposition and total microbial activity were observed between seasons, whereas phosphate production and denitrification were higher in summer. All activities were low in mid-depth volcanic-ash and clay layers because of low carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Surprisingly, the total microbial activity and decomposition in deep clay & peat and peat layers were the same as or higher than in shallow layers. However, denitrification was limited, probably because dissolved organic matter containing humic-like substances was unsuitable as a substrate. Moreover, total soil phosphorus levels, acid phosphatase activity and multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the soil in the Kushiro Wetland is likely P limited.

AB The Yorkshire Dales is one of the most iconic agricultural landscapes in Britain. However, many questions remain over the evolution of this landscape through time and its natural state before major human impacts. Here we present new palynological data that provide insight into the vegetation and fire history of the southern Yorkshire Dales from the late glacial period to present day. Our data suggest that there is considerable variation in vegetation history between sites, which probably reflects topographic and edaphic factors. Several of the records contain hiatuses that may reflect forest clearance, slow peat accumulation, or peat drainage, cutting and/or burning. Our data show a marked clearance of woodland beginning in the Neolithic period and intensifying in more recent times, marking the development of the contemporary agricultural landscape of the Yorkshire Dales.

AB The agricultural sector has potentially a significant role in reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs). Besides providing public goods, GHG reduction offers farmers new alternatives for income generation. This is especially interesting in marginal agricultural areas, e.g., in less-favoured areas (LFA) of the European Union (EU), where significant GHG reduction potential coincides with low productivity in the production of agricultural commodities.
   In this study, the effects of peatland cultivation restrictions were evaluated, where the objective was to decrease GHG fluxes deriving from agricultural production. The regional role of peatlands in GHG reduction and agricultural production is also evaluated. Ceasing the agricultural use of peatlands altogether could decrease Finnish agricultural sector carbon effluents by up to 10% according to a dynamic regional sector model of the Finnish agriculture (DREMFIA). Accompanying decreases in national and even in regional agricultural incomes do not appear drastic, but locally, in some municipalities and on individual farms they may be devastating. In an alternative scenario, where perennial grass production is allowed to continue and only cultivation of annual crops is forbidden, the (negative) income effects are very low. The most notable result is that significant GHG reductions can be reached with little decrease in national agricultural incomes.
   The two forms of restrictions were tested in two alternative agricultural policy settings: Agenda 2000 and the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform agreed in Luxembourg on 26th June 2003. These two agricultural policy alternatives are connected with both of the aforementioned climate policy alternatives and resulting scenarios are evaluated in the simulation. The simulation provides the second main result, which says that it is not so much the climate policy which determines aggregate agricultural production and income, but rather it is the general agricultural policy framework setting the stage.

AB [1] Growing season CH4 fluxes were monitored over a two year period following the start of ecosystem-scale manipulations of water table position and surface soil temperatures in a moderate rich fen in interior Alaska. The largest CH4 fluxes occurred in plots that received both flooding (raised water table position) and soil warming, while the lowest fluxes occurred in unwarmed plots in the lowered water table treatment. A combination of treatment and soil hydroclimate variables explained more than 70% of the variation in lntransformed CH4 fluxes, with mean daily water table position representing the strongest predictor. We used quantitative PCR of the alpha-subunit of mcr operon to explore the influence of soil climate manipulations on methanogen abundances. Methanogen abundances were greatest in warmed plots, and showed a positive relationship with mean daily CH4 fluxes. Our results show that water table manipulations that led to soil inundation (flooding) had a stronger effect on CH4 fluxes than water table drawdown. Seasonal CH4 fluxes increased by 80-300% under the combined wetter and warmer soil climate treatments. Thus, while warming is expected to increase CH4 emissions from Alaskan wetlands, higher water table positions caused by increases in precipitation or disturbances such as permafrost thaw that lead to thermokarst and flooding in wetlands will stimulate CH4 emissions beyond the effects of soil warming alone. Consequently, we argue that modeling the effects of climate change on Alaskan wetland CH4 emissions needs to consider the interactive effects of soil warming and water table position on CH4 production and transport.

AB Smouldering combustion is the driving phenomenon of wildfire in peatlands, like those causing haze episodes in Southeast Asia and Northeast Europe. These are the largest fires on Earth and an extensive source of greenhouse gases, but poorly understood, becoming an emerging research topic in climate-change mitigation. In this work, a series of multistep heterogeneous kinetics are investigated to describe the drying and decomposition in smouldering combustion of peat. The decomposition schemes cover a range of complexity, including 2, 3 or 4-step schemes, and up to 4 solid pseudo-species. The schemes aim to describe the simultaneous pyrolysis and oxidation reactions in smouldering fires. The reaction rates are expressed by Arrhenius law, and a lumped model of mass loss is used to simulate the degradation behaviour seen during thermogravimetric (TG) experiments in both nitrogen and air atmospheres. A genetic algorithm is applied to solve the corresponding inverse problem using TG data from the literature, and find the best kinetic and stoichiometric parameters for four types of boreal peat from different geographical locations (North China, Scotland and Siberia). The results show that at the TG level, all proposed schemes seem to perform well, with a high degree of agreement resulting from the forced optimization in the inverse problem approach. The chemical validity of the schemes is then investigated outside the TG realm and incorporated into a 1-D plug-flow model to study the reaction and the species distribution inside a peat smouldering front. Both lateral and in-depth spread modes are considered. The results show that the drying sub-front is essential, and that the best kinetics is the 4-step decomposition (one pyrolysis, and three oxidations) plus 1-step drying with 5 condensed species (water, peat, alpha-char, beta-char, and ash). This is the first time that the smouldering kinetics and the reaction-zone structure of a peat fire are explained and predicted, thus helping to understand this important natural and widespread phenomenon.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have increased in many sites in Europe and North America in recent decades. High DOC concentrations can damage the structure and functions of aquatic ecosystems by influencing water chemistry. This study investigated the spatial and seasonal variation of DOC concentrations in Irish streams across 55 sites at seven time occasions over 1 year (2006/2007). The DOC concentrations ranged from 0.9 to 25.9 mg/L with a mean value of 6.8 and a median value of 5.7 mg/L and varied significantly over the course of the year. The DOC concentrations from late winter (February: 5.2 +/- A 3.0 mg/L across 55 sites) and early spring (April: 4.5 +/- A 3.5 mg/L) had significantly lower DOC concentrations than autumn (October: mean 8.3 +/- A 5.6 mg/L) and early winter (December: 8.3 +/- A 5.1 mg/L). The DOC production sources (e.g., litterfall) or the accumulation of DOC over dry periods might be the driving factor of seasonal change in Irish stream DOC concentrations. Analysis of data using stepwise multiple linear regression techniques identified the topographic index (TI, an indication of saturation-excess runoff potential) and soil conditions (organic carbon content and soil drainage characteristics) as key factors in controlling DOC spatial variation in different seasons. The TI and soil carbon content (e.g., soil organic carbon; peat occurrence) are positively related to DOC concentrations, while well-drained soils are negatively related to DOC concentrations. The knowledge of spatial and seasonal variation of DOC concentrations in streams and their drivers are essential for optimum riverine water resources management.

AB History of variability of tropical cyclones (TC) in the North-Western Pacific is critical for understanding impacts of future climatic changes. Natural archives of paleo-typhoon variability can be used to assess how changes in the planetary climatic system during the Holocene could influence TC frequency and intensity in this part of Pacific. Extreme typhoon-related rains are the main cause of catastrophic floods on Sakhalin Island and deposits of these floods are evidence of paleo-typhoon. The paleo-typhoons that triggered extreme floods on Southern Sakhalin during the last 6.6 kyr are recorded in the sequence on the interfluvial surface in the northern Susunay Lowland (Naiba River basin). The sequence includes peat bog with numerous loam interlayers deposited during extreme floods inundating the bog. We reconstructed paleo-environmental conditions, including humidity and flood activity, based on analysis of diatoms. We found biological indicators that point to the past floods. The mineral content in the peat being one criteria indicative of the high frequency of floods. The peat bog developed in place of a lagoon that existed at the maximum phase of the Holocene transgression. Peat accumulation began in the freshened lagoon coast similar to 6010 cal yr B.P. When sea level dropped, the lagoon turned into a coastal lake (similar to 5710-5040 cal yr B.P.). A swamp formed in place of the lake under varying moisture conditions. We identified and dated 25 extreme floods and assessed the paleoclimatic background of the events. A recent catastrophic flood from typhoon Phyllis (1981 CE) is considered as an analogue of the paleo-events. The frequency of extreme typhoons increased both during warm (wet and dry) phases and in cold dry phases of the climate fluctuations. We identified three periods of a high typhoon activity (4640-4360; 4030-3580; 1860-1380 cal yr B.P.), when super-typhoons came onto the island once every 30-90 years. A comparison between the extreme typhoons in the south of Sakhalin and in the Sea of Japan region show both synchronism and metachronism of the periods of typhoon activity. Instrumental measurements during 20th-21st centuries revealed considerable changes in super-typhoon tracks; a similar variability may be safely supposed in typhoon tracks in the past. To predict future tropical cyclone activity and the risk of floods under modern climatic instability it is necessary to understand factors influencing variability in the occurrence of strong typhoons and associated extreme floods events on a paleo-scale. This is especially important for areas with rapidly developing coastal economies and intensive use of gas and oil resources, such as Sakhalin Island.

AB Permanent grasslands constitute the most widespread land use type for agriculturally managed peatlands in Europe. They are typically significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere as a result of drainage-induced peat decomposition, but quantitative data are still scarce. This study presents an in-depth analysis of CO2 flux variability at the site (n=3) and plot scale (n=9) for different Danish permanent grasslands on peat. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and ecosystem respiration were monitored over one year with closed dynamic chambers. The first part of the data analysis consisted of a detailed evaluation of the flux dataset to gain insight into the potential effects of fast fluctuations in the wind and light intensity on the plot scale CO2 flux. In the second part of the analysis, gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were modeled on the field and plot scale with candidate sets of simple light and temperature response models commonly applied in ecological studies. The detailed flux dataset analysis revealed that upward concave flux curves, which are not explainable by diffusion theory, can either be the result of a fan-induced increase in headspace turbulence, or of a photosynthesis overshoot into shaded or darkened chamber measurement periods. Instead of discarding such measurements from the dataset, this study proposes the use of linear flux calculation as a way to obtain less biased flux rate estimates. For the carbon balance modeling, it could be shown that annual NEE estimates for a site differ (0.2-0.3 kg CO2 m(-2)) between different models available for gap-filling CO2 flux time series even when the models were equally suitable according to statistical evaluation. Overall, all plots showed significant carbon losses over the course of a year (1.5-5.6 kg CO2 m(-2), including harvested aboveground biomass); however, it was not possible to relate spatial differences in the CO2 flux dynamics between and within the study sites to certain peat properties or management types due to high uncertainties in the annual estimates.

AB Soil respiration is an important component of terrestrial carbon cycling and is sensitive to environmental change. Most previous studies focus on the effect of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration, whereas the impact of spatial heterogeneity (e.g., microtopography) is seldom studied.
   To test the impact of microtopography on soil respiration, we performed a field investigation to examine soil respiration, soil temperature, soil water content, soil total porosity, soil organic content, and plant biomass at a hummock site (composed of grass hummocks and inter-hummock areas) and an adjacent flat meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.
   Similar seasonal dynamics of soil respiration in the grass hummocks, inter-hummock areas, and flat meadow were found in the alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. However, soil respiration of the grass hummocks was 79.3% and 413.9% higher than that of the flat meadow during the growing (April, June, August) and non-growing seasons (October, December, February), respectively. Although there was no difference in soil respiration between the inter-hummock areas and the flat meadow during the non-growing season, soil respiration was 42.5% higher at the inter-hummock areas than the flat meadow during growing season. Larger soil porosity, greater surface area, and more substrate supply, but not more root growth, likely contributed to the higher soil respiration of grass hummocks.
   Our findings suggest that the impact of spatial heterogeneity on soil respiration should be taken into consideration to facilitate the accurate estimation of soil carbon fluxes at ecosystem and regional scales.

AB Local and regional environmental conditions for the south-eastern Scheldt estuary during the middle and late Holocene period have been reconstructed based on pollen analysis, loss-on-ignition and radiocarbon dating of a sediment core from Doe (N-Belgium) and the comparison with existing data from other sites from the same region. Postglacial relative sea level rise resulted in the formation of alder carr vegetation in the lower parts of the landscape from c. 7640 cal BP onwards. The vegetation succession was weakly influenced by the deposition of tidal clay deposits between c. 6550 and 5650 a cal BP and eventually culminated in the development of an oligotrophic bog. Peat accumulation seems to have ceased between c. 2030 and 1220 a cal BP, well before it was covered by marine sediments in the late Middle Ages.

AB Increasing DOC concentrations in surface waters have been observed across parts of Europe and North America over the past few decades Most proposed explanations for these widespread trends invoke climate change or reductions in sulphate deposition However these factors do not seem apposite to explain either the fine-scale (within kilometres) or regional-scale spatial variation in DOC concentrations observed across the UK
   We have reconstructed DOC concentrations and land use for one North Pennine and five South Pennine catchments (UK) located in three discrete areas over the last four decades Rainfall temperature and sulphate deposition data where available were also collated and the potential influence of these factors on surface water DOC concentrations was assessed
   Four of the six catchments examined showed highly significant (p<0 001) increases (53-92%) in humic coloured DOC (hDOC) concentrations in drainage waters over the period 1990-2005 Changes in temperature and sulphate deposition may explain 20-30% of this trend in these four catchments However the rapid expansion of new moorland burn on blanket peat can explain a far greater degree (>80%) of the change in hDOC Far smaller increases in hDOC (10-18%) were identified for the two remaining catchments These two sites experienced similar changes in sulphur deposition and temperature to those that had seen largest increases in DOC but contained little or no moorland burn management on blanket peat
   This study shows that regional-scale factors undoubtedly underlie some of the recent observed increases in drainage humic coloured DOC However changes in land management in this case the extensive use of fire management on blanket peat are a far more important driver of increased hDOC release from upland catchments in some parts of the UK It suggests that the recent rapid increase in the use of burning on blanket peat moorland has implications for ecosystem services and carbon budgets (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved

AB The composition of soil solutions obtained by vacuum filtration from peat gleyic podzolic soils of the Central Forest State Biosphere Reserve under field conditions was determined. It was found that the composition and properties of the soil solutions reliably differ from those of the water extracts. The natural solutions are characterized by higher concentrations of metals (primarily of Na, K, Ca, and Cu), an increased content of the hydrophobic fraction of water-soluble substances, an order of magnitude lower carbon content, and lower values of the actual and potential acidity.

AB The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of soil organic matter content and pH on plant availability of both inorganic and organic selenium (Se) fertilisers. Further, the risk of Se leaching after application of inorganic Se fertiliser was evaluated. A new interpretation of an older field study at different sites in Southern Norway showed that organic C was correlated with grain Se concentration in wheat, barley and oats, explaining up to 60% of the variation in Se concentration. Pot experiments with a peat soil, a loam soil and a peat/loam soil mixture were conducted for the present study at a range of pH values between pH 5 and 7. Below pH 6, Se uptake from added Se fertiliser was higher in the soil types with high organic matter content than in the loam. The opposite occurred at a soil pH above 6, where Se uptake was higher in the loam than in the peat soil. A simple leaching experiment after one growing season confirmed the findings of the pot experiments that Se availability in the loam soil with a relatively low organic matter content increased with increasing pH, whereas it decreased in the peat soil. Neither Se yeast, nor pure Se methionine, used as organic Se fertiliser, resulted in any significant uptake of Se when added at concentrations similar to the inorganic Se applications.

AB Drainage and land-use are key factors that trigger CO2 emissions from cultivated organic soils. Drainage enhances aeration, and land-use might affect peat decomposition due to the input of fresh organic matter (FOM). The effect of FOM addition on peat decomposition of agriculturally used organic soils has seldom been quantified experimentally. In this study, we i) incubated soil samples taken from three adjacent former peatland sites that were chained and managed as cropland, perennial grassland and forest, respectively, and measured CO2 release over 16 months at 20 degrees C. In a second experiment, ii) we incubated soil samples from the same three sites with and without adding corn straw as FOM (2% w/w) at 20 degrees C over three weeks. The C-13 and C-14 signatures of soil organic carbon (SOC) and emitted CO2 enabled us to apportion the amount of decomposed corn, as well as to estimate relative effects of corn addition on the decomposition of SOC from old peat (SOCold) and from young soil organic carbon (SOCyoung). In the first experiment, samples lost between 0.03 and 0.09 mg CO2-C mg SOC-1 in the order forest > grassland > cropland. The higher C-14 values of the emitted CO2 vs. that of SOC indicated that SOCyoung was more easily decomposable. FOM addition induced negative (- 14.8 +/- 5.2%), positive (+ 14.9 +/- 4.6%) and neutral priming (- 14.2 +/- 30.0%) of SOC decomposition in the forest, grassland and cropland samples, respectively. Most importantly, we fmd that the relative contribution of SOCold to the overall CO2 release consistently decreased after FOM application, whereas decomposition of SOCyoung was rather stimulated. The latter finding is in line with previous studies on intact peat. Our results show that young and old C pools in managed organic soils respond differently to the addition of fresh plant residues, and FOM addition can effectively reduce the decomposition of old peat. Hitherto negative priming was never reported for agriculturally used organic soils and it might be caused by the overall poor decomposability of old peat.

AB Boreal forest covers approximately 80% of the total forested lands in Canada and comprises 73% of Ontario's commercially productive forest area. In Ontario, biological activity in the boreal zone is constrained by cold temperatures and a short growing season. Upland mineral soils are generally fragmental, acidic and poor in available nutrients; decomposition rates are slow. and active incorporation of humic material into mineral soil is minimal. Organic soils cover extensive areas where the water table is persistently high; much of the boreal region in Ontario consists of forested peatlands. The boreal forest is characterized by a predominance of coniferous tree species, although broadleaved trees form a significant canopy component in southern portions of the region. Although plant species diversity is relatively low, ecosystem structure ranges from simple to complex.

AB Sphagnum mosses dominate peatlands by employing harsh ecosystem tactics to prevent vascular plant growth and microbial degradation of these large carbon stores. Knowledge about Sphagnum-produced metabolites, their structure and their function, is important to better understand the mechanisms, underlying this carbon sequestration phenomenon in the face of climate variability. It is currently unclear which compounds are responsible for inhibition of organic matter decomposition and the mechanisms by which this inhibition occurs. Metabolite profiling of Sphagnum fallax was performed using two types of mass spectrometry (MS) systems and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR). Lipidome profiling was performed using LC-MS/MS. A total of 655 metabolites, including one hundred fifty-two lipids, were detected by NMR and LC-MS/MS-329 of which were novel metabolites (31 unknown lipids). Sphagum fallax metabolite profile was composed mainly of acid-like and flavonoid glycoside compounds, that could be acting as potent antimicrobial compounds, allowing Sphagnum to control its environment. Sphagnum fallax metabolite composition comparison against previously known antimicrobial plant metabolites confirmed this trend, with seventeen antimicrobial compounds discovered to be present in Sphagnum fallax, the majority of which were acids and glycosides. Biological activity of these compounds needs to be further tested to confirm antimicrobial qualities. Three fungal metabolites were identified providing insights into fungal colonization that may benefit Sphagnum. Characterizing the metabolite profile of Sphagnum fallax provided a baseline to understand the mechanisms in which Sphagnum fallax acts on its environment, its relation to carbon sequestration in peatlands, and provide key biomarkers to predict peatland C store changes (sequestration, emissions) as climate shifts.

AB Shore pine, which is a subspecies of lodgepole pine, was a widespread and dominant tree species in Southeast Alaska during the early Holocene. At present, the distribution of shore pine in Alaska is restricted to coastal bogs and fens, likely by competition with Sitka spruce and Western hemlock. Monitoring of permanent plots as part of the United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program identified a recent loss of shore pine biomass in Southeast Alaska. The apparent loss of shore pine is concerning, because its presence adds a vertical dimension to coastal wetlands, which are the richest plant communities of the coastal temperate rainforest in Alaska. In this study, we examined the shore pine tree-ring record from a newly established plot network throughout Southeast Alaska and explored climate-growth relationships. We found a steep decline in shore pine growth from the early 1960s to the present. Random Forest regression revealed a strong correlation between the decline in shore pine growth and the rise in growing season diurnal minimum air temperature. Warm summer nights, cool daytime temperatures and a reduced diurnal temperature range are associated with greater cloud cover in Southeast Alaska. This suite of conditions could lead to unfavorable tree carbon budgets (reduced daytime photosynthesis and greater nighttime respiration) and/or favor infection by foliar pathogens, such as Dothistroma needle blight, which has recently caused widespread tree mortality on lodgepole pine plantations in British Columbia. Further field study that includes experimental manipulation (e.g., fungicide application) will be necessary to identify the proximal cause(s) of the growth decline. In the meantime, we anticipate continuation of the shore pine growth decline in Southeast Alaska.

AB Although the majority of coastal sediments consist of sandy material, in some areas marine ingression caused the submergence of terrestrial carbon-rich peat soils. This affects the coastal carbon balance, as peat represents a potential carbon source. We performed a column experiment to better understand the coupled flow and biogeochemical processes governing carbon transformations in submerged peat under coastal fresh groundwater (GW) discharge and brackish water intrusion. The columns contained naturally layered sediments with and without peat (organic carbon content in peat 39 +/- 14 wt%), alternately supplied with oxygen-rich brackish water from above and oxygen-poor, low-saline GW from below. The low-saline GW discharge through the peat significantly increased the release and ascent of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the peat (delta C-13(DOC) - 26.9 parts per thousand to - 27.7 parts per thousand), which was accompanied by the production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), implying DOC mineralization. Oxygen respiration, sulfate (SO42-) reduction, and methane (CH4) formation were differently pronounced in the sediments and were accompanied with higher microbial abundances in peat compared to sand with SO42--reducing bacteria clearly dominating methanogens. With decreasing salinity and SO42- concentrations, CH4 emission rates increased from 16.5 to 77.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) during a 14-day, low-saline GW discharge phase. In contrast, oxygenated brackish water intrusion resulted in lower DOC and DIC pore water concentrations and significantly lower CH4 and CO2 emissions. Our study illustrates the strong dependence of carbon cycling in shallow coastal areas with submerged peat deposits on the flow and mixing dynamics within the subterranean estuary.

AB Understanding scale- and location-specific variations of soil nutrients in cultivated land is a crucial consideration for managing agriculture and natural resources effectively. In the present study, wavelet coherency was used to reveal the scale-location specific correlations between soil nutrients, including soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK), as well as topographic factors (elevation, slope, aspect, and wetness index) in the cultivated land of the Fen River Basin in Shanxi Province, China. The results showed that SOM, TN, AP, and AK were significantly inter-correlated, and that the scales at which soil nutrients were correlated differed in different landscapes, and were generally smaller in topographically rougher terrain. All soil nutrients but TN were significantly influenced by the wetness index at relatively large scales (32-72 km) and AK was significantly affected by the aspect at large scales at partial locations, showing localized features. The results of this study imply that the wetness index should be taken into account during farming practices to improve the soil nutrients of cultivated land in the Fen River Basin at large scales.

AB Linear regression functions are presented for predicting the volume increment and yield of peatland stands on sites drained far forestry in southern Finland. The data were collected from 329 permanent sample plots measured over a 70-yr period. Site was incorporated into the functions by means of four post-drainage classes (I-IV). These site classes were derived from the functional relationships between the post-drainage yield (total yield minus initial stand volume) at a reference time of 40 yr since drainage within the 21 vegetational site types represented in the data. The growth and yield functions were derived separately for each yield class. Stand volume, stem number, age since drainage, effective temperature sum, peat depth, and ditch spacing were used as predictors in the growth and yield functions. A site classification table, based on stand dominant height, drainage age, and initial volume, is presented for determining the yield class when applying the functions. Yield class can also be determined from the vegetational site types widely used in Finland. The reliability of the forecasts primarily depends on the quality of the data used in deriving the functions and on the input data in an application situation. Care should be taken when applying the functions to long-term simulations of future post-drainage growth and yield, where the growth and yield functions can be applied together.

AB Palaeobotanical investigations were carried out with the aim of reconstructing the development of palaeovegetation and formation of sediments in the northeastern area of ancient Lake Burtnieks. Pollen and plant macroremain studies provide information on vegetation development in the surroundings of the lake, including Stone Age settlements of Brauksas I and Brauksas II. Results of the investigations indicate that the development of vegetation together with sedimentation conditions in the palaeolake have changed since the Younger Dryas until today. Vegetation composition varies in different parts of the ancient Lake Burtnieks area due to past changes in lake water level which reached different sites at different times. Data from the northern part of ancient Lake Burtnieks indicate its gradual overgrowing since the Preboreal. Deposition of minerogenic lacustrine sediments (silt, clayey silt and sand) lasted until the Boreal or the Atlantic time, depending on the water depth of the lake locality. Clastic sediments were overlain by gyttja, which in turn was later covered by well-decomposed fen (sedge, sedgegrass) peat that started to form at the end of Atlantic time.
   Pollen and plant macroremain composition of lacustrine sediments and fen peat sequences suggests that people have inhabited the area since PreborealBoreal times. However, weak traces of possible presence of people are found already at the very end of the Younger Dryas.Fluctuating curves of broadleaved tree pollen, a significant amount of pollen of cultivated plants and charcoal dust in sediments indicate activities of an early man and refer to start of crop growing in the area in the second half of the Atlantic chronozone.

AB Microbes decompose fresh organic carbon inputs, such as plant litter, to CO2. Due to a high water-level (WL) in pristine peatlands the decomposition process is retarded and therefore, northern peatlands contain about 30% of the global soil carbon (C) pool. Global warming will decrease the WL of these soil C hotspots and therefore, the responses of the decomposition process of plant litter to shifts in WL regime is of interest. Two important decomposer communities, fungi and actinobacteria, were studied in a diverse set of litters incubated over two years in a boreal peatland. The experimental design involved a non-treatment control and plots experiencing short-term (ca 4 yrs) and long-term (ca 40 yrs) WL drawdown. The responses of litter-inhabiting fungal and actinobacterial decomposers to environmental variables (WL regime, site type, litter quality) were evaluated using PCR-DGGE fingerprinting and direct sequencing of regions within the 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA genes after reverse transcription of RNA into its complementary DNA.
   The fungal sequences found in the decomposing litters represented organisms from a variety of fungal taxa, whereas most of the actinobacterial sequences were only distantly similar to known actinobacteria. Our results indicated that: (1) WL regime and site type had minor impacts on the litter-inhabiting microbial community composition, (2) litter quality had the strongest impact on the communities, especially on fungi; (3) decomposition stage had an impact on the fungal community composition, showing a possible change from mycorrhizal to saprotrophic fungi and (4) mass loss of the litters after the two-year-decomposition period was not related to the variation in fungal community composition and only to a negligible extent to the actinobacterial community composition. In relation to the decomposition process these results align with the idea of functional redundancy in microbial communities, which does not seem to be modified by moderate WL drawdown. Overall, our results indicate that the WL regime modifies the litter-inhabiting microbial communities largely indirectly via litter quality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We estimated the magnitude of the radiative forcing (RF) due to changes in albedo following the forestation of peatlands, and calculated the net RF by taking into account the changes in both the albedo and the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes during one forest rotation. Data on radiation, tree biomass, and soil GHG fluxes were combined with models for canopy cover, tree carbon accumulation, and the RF due to increased atmospheric GHG concentrations for four typical site cases in Finland covering two soil nutrient levels in the south and north of the country. We also studied the observed long-term surface temperatures to detect any indications of drainage-induced effects. The magnitude of the albedo-induced RF was similar to that caused by the carbon sequestration of the growing trees. At three site cases out of four the drainage induced a cooling or negative RF, the tendency for cooling being higher at sites with a higher nutrient level. The differences in albedo-induced RF mainly arose from the spring season due to (1) the different snow cover duration in the south versus the north, and (2) the different albedos of drained and undrained snow covered peatlands. An increase in the maximum daily temperatures was observed in April in southern Finland, where the most intensive drainage practices have taken place, suggesting that forestry drainage has potentially affected the local climate. Our results show that the decreasing albedo resulting from peatland forestation contributes significantly to the RF, balancing out or even exceeding the cooling effect due to the changing GHG fluxes.

AB This research discusses new original data on the geochemistry of scandium (Sc) in the coals of the Asian region of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Iran. In general, the studied coals are enriched in Sc compared with the mean value for coals throughout the world. In different regions of the studied territory, coal deposits with anomalous Sc concentrations (up to commercially important concentrations) were found and the factors that control the Sc contents in those coals were revealed. The composition of the rock types that surround the coal-forming basins and the hydro-geochemical conditions of these basins and deposits determine the levels of Sc accumulation in the coals. It was found that Sc was redistributed and partially lost from the seams during coal metamorphism. Studies of the modes of Sc occurrence in the coals showed the predominance of an organic mode. In addition, the peculiarities of the Sc distribution in the deposits and coal seams indicate a predominantly hydrogenous mechanism for the accumulation of anomalous Sc concentrations in coal and peat. Scandium in coal and peat accumulates by leaching from coal-bearing strata and re-deposition in coal (peat) beds with the participation of soil and ground water enriched with organic acids. Specific conditions for the formation of coal containing Sc-enriched rocks and for the Sc leaching and transportation into coal seams are necessary for the accumulation of high Sc concentrations in the coals. Such conditions that occur in the contemporary mire ecosystems of Western Siberia could also have occurred in ancient basins of peat (coal) accumulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Late Miocene samples from the Xiaolongtan Formation in Puyang Basin were sampled systematically from bottom to top of the main coal seam. Organic petrological as well as geochemical methods have been applied, aiming at the reconstruction of the depositional environment. The studied samples contain abundant detrovitrinite and liptinite macerals with high ash but low to moderate sulfur contents. This data indicates that the samples were deposited in topogenic mires without marine influence, but with fluctuations of water table and/or water influx which are mirrored by ash and sulfur content. The low values of tissue preservation and vegetation index, but high values of gelification index and groundwater index (GWIAC) in the studied coal imply a peat accumulation in inundated marshes under slightly oxic to anoxic depositional conditions with input of herbaceous plants mainly. An extended data set on vitrinite reflectance, volatile matter, Rock-Eval T-max and HI suggests a coalification ranging from subbituminous C to B coal.
   The high concentration of long chain n-alkanes in the studied samples is typical for kerogen derived predominately from higher terrestrial plants. The applied biomarker ratios together with the detected hopenes further confirm the low thermal maturity level, as well as high water table and terrestrial organic matter input during peat accumulation. The variable concentrations of terpenoids and sesquiterpenoids suggest a dominant angiosperm input, but with a relatively high proportion of gymnosperms during some periods of peat deposition.

AB Radiocarbon (C-14) is a key tracer for detecting the mobilization of previously stored terrestrial organic carbon (C) into aquatic systems. Old C (>1,000years BP) may be masked by postbomb C (fixed from the atmosphere post-1950 CE), potentially rendering bulk aquatic dissolved organic C (DOC) C-14 measurements insensitive to old C. We collected DOC with a modern C-14 signature from a temperate Scottish peatland stream and decomposed it to produce CO2 under simulated natural conditions over 140days. We measured the C-14 of both DOC and CO2 at seven time points and found that while DOC remained close to modern in age, the resultant CO2 progressively increased in age up to 2,356767years BP. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the bulk (DOC)-C-14 pool can hide the presence of old C within peatland stream DOC export, demonstrating that bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements can be an insensitive indicator of peatland disturbance. Our experiment also demonstrates that this old C component is biologically and photochemically available for conversion to the greenhouse gas CO2, and as such, bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements do not reflect the C-14 signature of the labile organic C pool exported by inland water systems more broadly. Moreover, our experiment suggests that old C may be an important component of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from peatland aquatic systems, with implications for tracing and modeling interactions between the hydrological and terrestrial C cycles.
   Plain Language Summary The introduction of old carbon previously stored in soils for thousands of years into rivers can increase the net flux of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, impacting global climate. This is because rivers transport the equivalent of one third of human carbon emissions annually from land to the oceans. Much river-borne carbon is plant and soil (organic) matter that can decompose during transport, releasing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon dating can reveal the age of river-borne carbon, but previous measurements may have underestimated the age of carbon released into rivers by not considering the potential for old carbon hidden within individual bulk water samples. Using an incubation experiment, we demonstrate that dissolved organic carbon from a Scottish peatland stream that would be considered modern in age using traditional bulk radiocarbon dating can readily decompose to produce carbon dioxide with an old radiocarbon signature up to similar to 2,500years old. This demonstrates that radiocarbon dating of bulk riverine dissolved organic carbon can hide the presence of old carbon. Furthermore, these results indicate that old carbon may be more common in the global carbon cycle than previously thought, with important implications for our understanding and modeling of peatland ecosystems.

AB Ecosystems are increasingly prone to climate extremes, such as drought, with long-lasting effects on both plant and soil communities and, subsequently, on carbon (C) cycling. However, recent studies underlined the strong variability in ecosystem's response to droughts, raising the issue of nonlinear responses in plant and soil communities. The conundrum is what causes ecosystems to shift in response to drought. Here, we investigated the response of plant and soil fungi to drought of different intensities using a water table gradient in peatlands-a major C sink ecosystem. Using moving window structural equationmodels, we show that substantial changes in ecosystem respiration, plant and soil fungal communities occurred when the water level fell below a tipping point of -24cm. As a corollary, ecosystem respiration was the greatest when graminoids and saprotrophic fungi became prevalent as a response to the extreme drought. Graminoids indirectly influenced fungal functional composition and soil enzyme activities through their direct effect on dissolved organic matter quality, while saprotrophic fungi directly influenced soil enzyme activities. In turn, increasing enzyme activities promoted ecosystem respiration. We show that functional transitions in ecosystem respiration critically depend on the degree of response of graminoids and saprotrophic fungi to drought. Our results represent a major advance in understanding the nonlinear nature of ecosystem properties to drought and pave the way towards a truly mechanistic understanding of the effects of drought on ecosystem processes.

AB We present new original data on the geochemistry of scandium in the coals of Asian Russia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. In general, the studied coals are enriched in Sc as compared with the average coals worldwide. Coal deposits with abnormally high, up to commercial, Sc contents were detected in different parts of the study area. The factors for the accumulation of Sc in coals have been identified. The Sc contents of the coals depend on the petrologic composition of coal basins (composition of rocks in their framing) and the facies conditions of coal accumulation. We have established the redistribution and partial removal of Sc from a coal seam during coal metamorphism. The distribution of Sc in deposits and coal seams indicates the predominantly hydrogenic mechanism of its anomalous concentration in coals and peats. The accumulation of Sc in the coals and peats is attributed to its leaching out of the coal-bearing rocks and redeposition in a coal (peat) layer with groundwater and underground water enriched in organic acids. The enrichment of coals with Sc requires conditions for the formation of Sc-enriched coal-bearing rocks and conditions for its leaching and transport to the coal seam. Such conditions can be found in the present-day peatland systems of West Siberia and, probably, in ancient basins of peat (coal) accumulation. (C) 2014, V. S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS.

AB An assessment of the degree of contrast in the physicochemical properties of pyrogenic peat soils and fire-induced carbon losses 20 years after a major fire that partially destroyed a swamp spruce forest (Picea obovata Ledeb.) located within a complex of small river valleys in Kuznetsk Alatau, Republic of Khakassia, is made. The area affected by the fire is currently occupied by a shrub-sedge-green moss-hypnum birch forest (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) belonging to the group of short-term-secondary postfire grass forests. The pyrogenic peat soils (i.e., mechanical and chemical underburning) that formed as a result of passive smoldering (i.e., thermal impact below the ignition point) feature a high variability of physicochemical parameters (Cv = 26-37%). The application of multivariate statistical analysis techniques (cluster, discriminant, and canonical analysis) has made it possible to distinguish and statistically substantiate four clusters that correlate with the series of pyrogenic peat soils. Organic carbon makes the greatest (83%) input into the total contribution of chemical parameters to the differentiation of clusters, while the input of the volumetric water content is significantly less (15%). Based on the diversity and abundance of fire traces in the profile of pyrogenic peat soils, the distinguished clusters have been conditionally associated with slight, moderate, medium, and strong thermal impacts. Proportionally to the fire impact intensity, the soil clusters are enriched with ash components by 1.6-2.7 times (the ash content varies from 18.9 to 77%) and compacted by 2.2-4.3 times (the bulk weight reaches 0.147-0.421 g/cm(3)), while their pH value gradually changes from 6.8 to 7.6. A new approach to assessing carbon losses that occur in the course of passive peat smoldering is proposed. The new approach is based on the difference in the carbon content before and after the fire; it supplements the traditional method based on the peat-deposit incineration depth. The additional carbon losses in the 0- to 20-cm layer of pyrogenic peat soils vary in the range from 1.6 to 4.0 kg/m(2), which is equivalent to 5.9-14.8 kg/m(2) in CO2 emissions. The data on additional carbon losses at the stage of passive peat deposit smoldering are presented for the first time.

AB To investigate the potential of stable isotopes of Sphagnum peat deposits for palaeoclimate research and to inform sampling strategies, we present results from a study of selected Sphagnum plant constituents. We report a combined stable carbon and oxygen isotope record of cellulose separately extracted from Sphagnum branches and stem sections manually sampled from a similar to 4000 year old peat, deposited in a small dry maar crater located in the Westeifel Volcanic Field, Germany. We have determined the species composition of each individual sample of Sphagnum branches to address the sensitivity of the stable isotope records to potential changes in Sphagnum assemblages. The youngest approximately 3000 years old peat section consists of scarcely decomposed Sphagnum plant material. From the bog's surface to a depth of similar to 60 cm the predominant species is Sphagnum magellanicum. Between similar to 60 and similar to 550 cm the peat predominantly consists of Sphagnum capillifolium var. rubellum. At greater depths the decomposition status increases, species identification is, however, solely achievable if the record under examination consists of moderately decomposed peat. The stable carbon and oxygen isotope values of cellulose from Sphagnum stem sections are significantly lighter than those of the branches. Both isotopic offsets between the different plant compounds exhibit a strong degree of correlation, are statistically highly significant and observable down-core. The stable carbon isotope offset averages to 1.5 parts per thousand, however, presumably decreases with increasing age of the plant material. In contrast, the averaged oxygen isotope offset of 0.9 parts per thousand is consistent in time. Our results imply that if no differentiation into Sphagnum branches and stem sections prior to stable isotope analyses is possible, erroneous interpretations of the isotope records are likely, since down-core changes in the ratio of branches to stem sections in the peat profile are most likely. This also implies that the removal of all non-Sphagnum plants or plant fragments is insufficient to retrieve stable isotope signals from peat deposits exclusively reflecting palaeo-environmental conditions. Even isotopic records from bulk Sphagnum cellulose comprise of two different signals: firstly, an environmental signal based on the plant response to external controls. This signal is, however, masked by a second plant physiological signal originating from the isotopic offset between branches and stem sections. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The vascular and bryophyte floras of subantarctic Heard Island were classified using cluster analysis into six vegetation communities: Open Cushion Carpet, Mossy Feldmark, Wet Mixed Herbfield, Coastal Biotic Vegetation, Saltspray Vegetation, and Closed Cushion Carpet. Multidimensional scaling indicated that the vegetation communities were not well delineated but were continua. Discriminant analysis and a classification tree identified altitude, wind, peat depth, bryophyte cover and extent of bare ground, and particle size as discriminating variables. The combination of small area, glaciation, and harsh climate has resulted in reduced vegetation variety in comparison to those subantarctic islands north of the Antarctic Polar Front Zone. Some of the functional groups and vegetation communities found on warmer subantarctic islands are not present on Heard Island, notably ferns and sedges and fernbrakes and extensive mires, respectively.

AB Large expanses of herbaceous floating mat wetlands (FMW) bordered by slightly higher uplands with forest or scrub occur in the northwest corner of the Tanana Flats between the Alaska Range and the Tanana. River. Five major FMW systems, together with other outliers and extensions, are linear in shape and cover over 20 km(2). Nutrient-rich and circumneutral water flows slowly through these areas toward the northwest and through outlets to the Tanana River. The floating mat vegetation consists of tall emergent macrophytes; mosses, in particular Sphagnum spp., are conspicuously absent and shrubs are infrequent. Although species dominance shifts over short distances on the mat, four community types can be recognized: (1) Menyanthes trifoliata, (2) Carex aquatilis, (3) Typha latifolia, and (4) Calla palustris. Below the water surface, the mat extends to a depth of 0.5 to 1.0 m and consists of rhizomes and roots in a matrix of well-decomposed peat and water. The mat then either directly overlies unfrozen gray silts at a depth of 1 m, or more commonly, floats on a clear-water or loose peat zone above more consolidated peat lying on unfrozen silt at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 m. No permafrost or frozen ground was detected in late August or late winter below these floating mats but it is ubiquitous on the bordering uplands, 0.5 to 2 m above the FMW. The topographic location, apparent absence of permafrost, water chemistry, and vegetation composition suggest that these areas are fens fed by groundwater sources flowing out of the Alaska Range. Permafrost degradation and lateral expansion of these FMW is indicated by slumped blocks of forest pear, dead trees, and open water moats along the upland margin. Although floating mats are frequently described in the literature as occupying the edge of northern ponds and lakes, the FMW described here do not and they appear to be unique because of their large extent, absence of mosses, physiographic position, and presumed origin.

AB Population dynamics and food preferences of the testate amoeba species complex Nebela tincta major-bohemica-collaris ("Nebela collaris sensu lato") were described from a Sphagnum peatland over one growing season. The average abundance of Nebela collaris sensu lato was 29582 ind. 1(-1) active, and 2263 ind. 1(-1) encysted forms. On average, 17.4% of Nebela collaris sensu lato specimens were observed associated with prey, 71% of which could not be identified because of their poor preservation state. Among the identified prey, those most frequently ingested were micro-algae (45% of the total predator-prey associations, especially diatoms: 33%), and spores and mycelia of fungi (36%). Large ciliates, rotifers and small testate amoebae were also ingested, but mainly in summer. The seasonal variations in the proportions of prey categories in the ecosystem and the percentage of identifiable prey lead us to hypothesise that (1) Nebela collaris sensu lato ingest mainly immobile, senescent or dead organisms, and (2) that the more mobile micro-organisms such as ciliates and micro-Metazoa become more accessible, in relatively dry conditions, when the water film is thin.

AB Environmental contextLead and mercury are toxic atmospheric pollutants emitted in large quantities since 1850. Accumulating lake and peat sediments capture the pollutants from the atmosphere and indirectly record changes in deposition through time. This study of four long-term sediment records addresses the questions, What proportion of this atmospheric deposition is natural background?' and Does the archive faithfully represent true rates of atmospheric deposition?' AbstractAtmospheric phenomena have a large influence on the flux of mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Some direct phenomena involve high-frequency variations in air movement; other indirect processes involve longer-term changes in climate and associated vegetation and hydrology. Here, we use evidence from sediment cores to explore how these atmospheric and landscape processes produced large natural variations in Hg and Pb deposition over thousands of years before industrial pollution. Cores from Sargent Mountain Pond, coastal Maine, USA (16600 years), Plene Lake, south-western Czech Republic (15000 years), Lake Tulane, central Florida, USA (45000 years), and Caribou Bog, Orono, Maine, USA (10000 years) each illustrate how long-term local environmental changes influence the deposition and net retention of Hg and Pb. Important natural factors that emerge from comparisons among these four sites include forestation, changing groundwater hydrology, evolution of the watershed and lake system and (watershed area)/(lake area) ratio, all overlain by late-Holocene anthropogenic atmospheric pollution.

AB Anaerobic digestates from sewage sludge (SSADs) are a by-product of the wastewater treatment process that still preserves a certain agronomic interest for its richness in plant nutrients and organic matter. Fertilizing properties of two liquid and two dewatered SSADs were tested on tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Pot experiments were performed on sandy soil and peat substrate under greenhouse conditions with a SSADs application rate of 170 kg N/ha over a period of three months. Beneficial effects of SSADs were reported on different growth parameters, revealing an increase in biomass and height up to 37.5 and 6-folds over untreated control. No phytotoxic effect occurred on SSAD-exposed plants. Chemical analysis of soils treated with SSADs showed enrichment of macro- and micro-nutrients as well as organic matter. In some cases, the chemical characterization of leaves revealed an enhancement of uptaken macronutrients. This study contributed in general to deepen the knowledge on the short-term growing season fertilizing effects of SSAD. Despite the treatment dosage was calculated only on nitrogen requirements, the study highlighted the importance of the other nutrients and organic matter on plant growth.

AB Vascular plant responses to experimental enrichment with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), using MINIFACE technology, were studied in a Dutch lowland peatland dominated by Sphagnum and Phragmites for 3 years. We hypothesized that vascular plant carbon would accumulate in this peatland in response to CO2 enrichment owing to increased productivity of the predominant species and poorer quality (higher C/N ratios) and consequently lower decomposability of the leaf litter of these species. Carbon isotope signatures demonstrated that the extra 180 ppmv CO2 in enriched plots had been incorporated into vegetation biomass accordingly. However, on the CO2 sequestration side of the ecosystem carbon budget, there were neither any significant responses of total aboveground abundance of vascular plants, nor of any of the individual species. On the CO2 release side of the carbon budget (decomposition pathway), litter quantity did not differ between ambient and CO2 treatments, while the changes in litter quality (N and P concentration, C/N and C/P ratio) were marginal and inconsistent. It appeared therefore that the afterlife effects of significant CO2-induced changes in green-leaf chemistry (lower N and P concentrations, higher C/N and C/P) were partly offset by greater resorption of mobile carbohydrates from green leaves during senescence in CO2-enriched plants. The decomposability of leaf litters of three predominant species from ambient and CO2-enriched plots, as measured in a laboratory litter respiration assay, showed no differences. The relatively short time period, environmental spatial heterogeneity and small plot sizes might explain part of the lack of CO2 response. When our results are combined with those from other Sphagnum peatland studies, the common pattern emerges that the vascular vegetation in these ecosystems is genuinely resistant to CO2-induced change. On decadal time-scales, water management and its effects on peatland hydrology, N deposition from anthropogenic sources and land management regimes that arrest the early successional phase (mowing, tree and shrub removal), may have a greater impact on the vascular plant species composition, carbon balance and functioning of lowland Sphagnum-Phragmites reedlands than increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere.

AB Coal composition was investigated by means of photometric and maceral analyses on closely spaced lithotype-based strip samples over the full thickness of several paralic coal seams from the Cretaceous Gates Formation of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. The aim of this investigation was to test various methods of identifying accommodation trends in coal and use them to refine sequence-stratigraphic interpretation of continental sediments. Conventional sequence stratigraphy derives its subdivisions and significant surfaces from the records left by relative sea-level oscillations. These records either do not project into the continental realm, or are difficult to recognise in elastic non-marine sediments. Paralic coal seams have been selected to study this problem, because they are not entirely removed from marine influence and, compared with most inorganic deposits, coal has stored a greater wealth of information that can be analysed at a higher level of resolution. The study has led to the identification of five new surfaces with chronostratigraphic potential in the sequence-stratigraphic analysis of non-marine sediments. Two of these surfaces, called paludification surface (PaS) and terrestrialisation surface (TeS), occur at the bases of the investigated coal seams, while two other surfaces, referred to as non-marine flooding surface (NFS) and give-up transgressive surface (GUTS), form the tops of the coal. The fifth and probably most important new surface, called the accommodation-reversal surface (ARS), is independent of any particular facies and may either coincide with some of the other surfaces or occur separately. The proportion of detrital minerals has been used as the chief discriminator between different mire types and accommodation trends. Other useful indicators of mire type and peat dispersal have been the proportions of sporinite and inertodetrinite, as well as some derived maceral and/or mineral ratios, e.g., the groundwater influence index and the tissue preservation index. Isometamorphic variations of telovitrinite reflectance and fluorescence, as well as their coefficients of variation were also found to contribute to the identification of cyclic shifts between balanced and unbalanced accommodation/peat accumulation ratios. Some of these cycles, which are backed up by elastic stratigraphy, appear to correspond to the development of shallowing-upward and deepening-upward parasequences. Superimposed high-frequency, low-amplitude perturbations in the coal cycles relate to smaller-scale accommodation cycles of sub-parasequence level, not always recognised in non-marine strata. These sub-parasequence coal cycles do not always continue the shallowing-upward trend typical of conventional parasequences. Several coals were found to contain stacks of small-scale cycles with upward increasing accommodation signatures either in their lower or upper halves, or over the whole seam section.

AB Tree seedlings loaded with nutrients during nursery production have shown increased growth and survival relative to standard seedlings upon outplanting. We examined outplanting performance of nutrient loaded and standard trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings, along with composition and cover of competing vegetation, on a boreal oil sands reclamation site with two different soil types (forest floor mineral mix and peat mineral mix) and four different broadcast fertilizer applications [250 kg/ha immediately available fertilizer (IAF), 500 kg/ha IAF, 670 kg/ha controlled release fertilizer, and an unfertilized control]. Average height growth across all treatments was 19 % greater for nutrient loaded aspen seedlings than standard seedlings after two growing seasons. With respect to soil types, aspen growth was greater on peat mineral mix and seedlings growing in this soil type showed a greater response to both nutrient loading and fertilization; however, this could partially be attributed to greater cover by competing vegetation on the forest floor mineral mix. In the first growing season, trees treated with immediately available fertilizer showed the greatest growth response but in the second growing season only the controlled release fertilizer application resulted in growth rates greater than the controls. Fertilizer regime had similar effects on total cover of competing vegetation, although fertilization additionally promoted increased cover of grasses in the forest floor mineral mix. Overall, we clearly show that nutrient loaded trembling aspen seedlings can be used to offset early field fertilization needs at forest reclamation sites.

AB Cotoneaster dammeri C. K. Schneid. 'Coral Beauty' and (Forsythia ovata x Forsythia europaea Deg. and Bald.) Forsythia 'Northern Gold' were grown in 3.8-L containers in a softwood bark-peat-sand medium, using overhead, pulse, drip or subirrigation methods. N, P and K were supplied from Nutricote 16N-4.4P-8.1K(type 140) controlled-release fertilizer: Overhead sprinklers irrigated containers during two 45-min periods each day. Daily pulse irrigation was from sprinklers for four 7-min periods, and drip irrigation to individual containers occurred during two 5-min periods. For subirrigation, plants were placed on permanently saturated sand beds. Subirrigation resulted in significantly higher plant dry weights at the end of the growing season than all other treatments. Measured daily leaching volumes were greatest from overhead-irrigated containers, followed by drip- and then pulse-irrigated containers. Leaching from the subirrigated treatment was small and sporadic, occurring only after moderate rainfall. Shoot water potential (psi(T)) Was measured at weekly intervals through the middle of the growing season. There were no differences in predawn or dusk psi(T) values between treatments, but midday psi(T) was generally lower in subirrigated plants. At the end of the growing season, electric conductivity of the medium was highest for subirrigation, intermediate for drip and pulse irrigation, and lowest for overhead irrigation. This pattern was repeated for foliar K levels. It appears that superior growth of subirrigated plants is due more to better nutrient retention in the medium than to any effect on plant water status.

   Neglected but vital contribution of the nongrowing season

AB The vast wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau are expected to be an important natural source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. The magnitude, patterns and environmental controls of CH4 emissions on different timescales, especially during the nongrowing season, remain poorly understood, because of technical limitations and the harsh environments. We conducted the first study on year-round CH4 fluxes in an alpine wetland using the newly developed LI-COR LI-7700 open-path gas analyzer. We found that the total annual CH4 emissions were 26.4 and 33.8 g CH(4)m(-2) in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and the nongrowing season CH4 emissions accounted for 43.2-46.1% of the annual emissions, highlighting an indispensable contribution that was often overlooked by previous studies. A two-peak seasonal variation in CH4 fluxes was observed, with a small peak in the spring thawing period and a large one in the peak growing season. We detected a significant difference in the diurnal variation of CH4 fluxes between the two seasons, with two peaks in the growing season and one peak in the nongrowing season. We found that the CH4 fluxes during the growing season were well correlated with soil temperature, water table depth and gross primary production, whereas the CH4 fluxes during the nongrowing season were highly correlated with soil temperature. Our results suggested that the CH4 emission during the nongrowing season cannot be ignored and the vast wetlands on the Tibetan plateau will have the potential to exert a positive feedback on climate considering the increasing warming, particularly in the nongrowing season in this region.

AB Using both historic records and CORINE land cover maps, we assessed the impact of land cover change on the stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the Republic of Ireland from 1851 to 2000. We identified ten principal land cover classes: arable land, forest, grassland, heterogeneous agricultural areas/other, nonvegetated semi-natural areas, peatland, suburban, urban, water bodies, and wetland. For each land cover class, the SOC stock was estimated as the product of SOC density and land cover area. These were summed to calculate a national SOC budget for the Republic of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland's 6.94 million hectares of land have undergone considerable change over the past 150 years. The most striking feature is the decrease in arable land from 1.44 million ha in 1851 to 0.55 million ha in 2000. Over the same time period, forested land increased by 0.53 million ha. As of 2000, agricultural lands including arable land (7.85%), grassland (54.33%), and the heterogeneous agricultural areas/other class (7.91%) account for 70.09% of Irish land cover. We estimate that the SOC stock in the Republic of Ireland, to 1 m depth, has increased from 1,391 Tg in 1851 to 1,469 Tg in 2000 despite soil loss due to urbanization. This increase is largely due to the increase of forested land with its higher SOC stocks when compared to agricultural lands. Peatlands contain a disproportionate quantity of the SOC stock. Although peatlands only occupy 17.36% of the land area, as of 2000, they represented 36% of the SOC stock (to 1 m depth).

AB Boreal wetlands, primarily peatlands, are important global carbon (C) reservoirs and integral components of regional hydrological networks. This paper summarizes our current state of knowledge regarding components of water and nutrient budgets in northern wetlands, with a focus on Canada. Boreal wetland water budgets are strongly influenced by the following: seasonal weather patterns as they relate to the timing of precipitation and meltwater inputs and evapotranspiration (ET) losses; vegetation cover in the wetland and surrounding uplands as it relates to rain and snow interception and evapotranspiration; and connectivity of the wetland to the regional hydrological network. Key factors that influence boreal wetland phosphorus (P) budgets are: spatial and temporal variability in the water table as they relate to reduction-oxidation conditions and rewetting of highly decomposed peat; concentrations of metals and ions involved in P complexation and release; vegetation age and type (herbaceous versus woody); and seasonal weather patterns as they relate to water retention time. As with other components of the boreal forest, wetlands are often limited in bioavailable nitrogen (N), therefore bulk deposition and symbiotic fixation are key N sources. Within many wetlands, N is rapidly cycled through vegetation and microbial communities, and converted to gaseous N or exported as organic N in outflows. In terms of C budgets, boreal wetlands are important reservoirs, converting inorganic and organic C inputs to peat. Climate change and anthropogenic N loading threaten the water and C balance in boreal wetlands.

AB Numerous long-term, free-air plant growth facilities currently explore vegetation responses to the ongoing climate change in northern latitudes. Open top chamber (OTC) experiments as well as the experimental set-ups with active warming focus on many facets of plant growth and performance, but information on morphological alterations of plant cells is still scarce. Here we compare the effects of in-situ warming on leaf epidermal cell expansion in dwarf birch, Betula nana in Finland, Greenland, and Poland. The localities of the three in-situ warming experiments represent contrasting regions of B. nana distribution, with the sites in Finland and Greenland representing the current main distribution in low and high Arctic, respectively, and the continental site in Poland as a B. nana relict Holocene microrefugium. We quantified the epidermal cell lateral expansion by microscopic analysis of B. nana leaf cuticles. The leaves were produced in paired experimental treatment plots with either artificial warming or ambient temperature. At all localities, the leaves were collected in two years at the end of the growing season to facilitate between-site and within-site comparison. The measured parameters included the epidermal cell area and circumference, and using these, the degree of cell wall undulation was calculated as an Undulation Index (UI). We found enhanced leaf epidermal cell expansion under experimental warming, except for the extremely low temperature Greenland site where no significant difference occurred between the treatments. These results demonstrate a strong response of leaf growth at individual cell level to growing season temperature, but also suggest that in harsh conditions other environmental factors may limit this response. Our results provide evidence of the relevance of climate warming for plant leaf maturation and underpin the importance of studies covering large geographical scales.

AB Aims Poorly drained arctic ecosystems are potential large emitters of methane (CH4) due to their high soil organic carbon content and low oxygen availability. In wetlands, aerenchymatous plants transport CH4 from the soil to the atmosphere, but concurrently transport O-2 to the rhizosphere, which may lead to oxidation of CH4. The importance of the latter process is largely unknown for arctic plant species and ecosystems. Here, we aim to quantify the subsurface oxidation of CH4 in a waterlogged arctic ecosystem dominated by Carex aquatilis ssp. stans and Eriophorum angustifolium, and evaluate the overall effect of these plants on the CH4 budget.
   Methods A mesocosms study was established based on the upper 20 cm of an organic soil profile with intact plants retrieved from a peatland in West Greenland (69 degrees N). We measured dissolved concentrations and emissions of (CO2)-C-13 and (CH4)-C-13 from mesocosms during three weeks after addition of C-13-enriched CH4 below the mesocosm.
   Results Most of the recovered C-13 label (> 98 %) escaped the ecosystem as CH4, while less than 2 % was oxidized to (CO2)-C-13.
   Conclusions It is concluded that aerenchymatous plants control the overall CH4 emissions but, as a transport system for oxygen, are too inefficient to markedly reduce CH4 emissions.

AB The persistence and movement of methabenzthiazuron, metazachlor, trifluralin, iprodione, fenitrothion, fenvalerate and furathiocarb was studied in one growing season in cultivated clay, finesand and organic soils in southern Finland. Trifluralin was studied for two growing seasons.
   Methabenzthiazuron was the most mobile pesticide and metazachlor was almost as much mobile. They leached at least 15 cm in a month. Fenitrothion and fenvalerate were the most immobile.
   Trifluralin was the most and fenitrothion the least persistent. The concentrations of iprodione and fenvalerate in the top soils increased towards the autumn, presumably due to leaching of pesticides from plants. The residues of trifluralin measured in the surface layer of the mineral soils at the end of the growing season might have been harfmul to plants sensitive to trifluralin. The residues of trifluralin in the peat soil surface 1.5 years after the treatment were still high. Also methabenzthiazuron, iprodine and fenvalerate residues may in atl probability have been detected in the following spring. If the half-life of a pesticide is over 80 - 100 days. it is likely that residues of it may be found in the spring following the application in cultivated Finnish soils.

AB Oil sands mining is a major disturbance to boreal landscapes in north-eastern Alberta, Canada. Freshwater peatlands dominate the landscape prior to mining, but the post-mining reclamation landscape will have wetlands that span a salinity gradient. Little is known about the native Vegetation communities in subsaline and saline marshes in the boreal region, yet these communities offer the best potential for reclamation of wetlands after oil sands mining. The overall intent of this study is to provide information oil natural wetland communities along a gradient of salinities that can be used to enhance oil sands wetland reclamation. Our specific study objectives were to: (I) characterize environmental conditions of industrial and natural wetlands, (2) characterize vegetation communities (Composition and diversity) lit these wetlands, (3) and explore how vegetation communities (composition and diversity) may be influenced by environmental conditions. We Surveyed vegetation communities and environmental variables in 25 natural boreal wetlands along a salinity gradient and in 10 industrial marshes ill the oil sands mining region. We observed all electrical conductivity (EC) range of 0.5-28 mS cm(-1) in the wetlands, indicating that salinity similar to or higher than anticipated for oil sands reclamation is naturally present in some boreal wetlands. We observed low species richness in both industrial and natural wetlands. There were 101 plant species observed in all the wetlands, with 82 species recorded in the natural wetlands and 44 species in industrial wetlands. At the plot level, richness decreased with increasing EC and pH, but increased with soil organic matter. Using Cluster Analysis and indicator species analysis we defined 16 distinct vegetation community types, each dominated by one or two species of graminoid vegetation. In general these communities resembled those of boreal or prairie marshes. Electrical conductivity, pH, and water depth were important factors correlating with community composition Of the wetlands, however peat depth and soil organic content did not differ among community types. Not all community types were present in industrial wetlands, indicating that these communities may need to be planted to enhance overall diversity ill future reclaimed oil sands wetlands.

AB The partitioning of biomass between traps and leaves is a measure of the investment in carnivory of Utricularia vulgaris and is dependent on the relative values of three attributes: trap size, trap number and leaf size.
   Marked seasonal and individual variations in trap size, trap number and leaf size occur within a small Population of U. vulgaris at Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire, UK, with some plants consistently having fewer traps per leaf than others, and some smaller leaves than others, throughout the growing season. However, the three attributes vary independently, so that all combinations over the observed ranges of trap size, trap number and leaf size occur simultaneously in the population.
   In spite of the variation in the three constituent factors, the proportion of biomass invested in traps is close to 50 % in the majority of plants and throughout most of the growing season. The contribution of traps to total biomass cannot be predicted from the number of traps per leaf.
   Although the proportion of biomass represented by traps is the most useful measure of a plant's investment in carnivory, the precise way in which the biomass is partitioned between a variable number of traps of different sizes may also be an important consideration in cost-benefit analyses.

AB Regional uplift of structural highs took place in the greater North Sea region in early Middle Jurassic times, resulting in a change from marine shelf deposition in the Early Jurassic to widespread emergence, erosion and localized deposition in grabens The Middle Jurassic Bag A Formation exposed on the Island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea was deposited in the Ronne Graben, which forms a dog-leg pull-apart basin linking the northern and southern branches of the Tornquist Zone The studied succession is situated on the hanging wall immediately adjacent to the main eastern graben margin fault and the footwall consists of deeply weathered granite. It is the only locality along the northern branch of the Tornquist Zone where active tectonic influence on Middle Jurassic deposition can be demonstrated in outcrop
   Small alluvial fans composed of poorly sorted washout sands and muddy debris flows with weathered granite boulders fringed the footwall scarp Syn-depositional soft-sediment deformation and chaotic bedding structures interpreted as seismites caused by earthquake shocks are characteristic at several levels On the hanging wall further away from the active fault the depositional environment was dominated by shallow freshwater lakes with deposition of clay. Lake deposition outpaced subsidence and open, oxygen-deficient freshwater mires were formed during periods of no or only incremental fault-movement. The miles were only occasionally isolated from elastic input due to doming and dense vegetation, resulting in accumulation of pure peat beds The content of spores and pollen shows that the mires were covered by a vegetation of arborescent and herbaceous Filicopsida (ferns), Lycopsida (club mosses), Cycadales/Bennettitales, Ginkgoales, Caytontales. Taxodiaceae or Cupressaceae, and Araucariaceae. Wildfires were common in the mires and also on the footwall probably followed by episodes of increased run-off and erosion of the upland
   The presence of common washout sands, debntes, seismites and abundant lacustrine flooding surfaces indicating sudden drowning of the mires was caused by abrupt movements on the fault with associated earthquakes The succession thus provides an example of temporal changes in deposition in response to changes in tectonic conditions.
   The study illustrates how regional uplift of structural highs caused a restriction of deposition to narrow grabens like the Ronne Graben. Facies patterns changed dramatically from laterally extensive uniform packages controlled by sea-level changes in the Early Jurassic to strongly localized deposition with marked facies changes controlled by faulting and earthquakes in the Middle Jurassic. The succession thus serves as an excellent example of tectonically controlled deposition under humid conditions in a continental graben. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Sphagnum is an important peat-forming genus, which aids the carbon sequestration of peatlands. Sphagnum is sensitive to drought; however, and it is uncertain how well it can recover from long periods without rainfall. Spectral reflectance can be used to assess Sphagnum desiccation damage, and we also tested whether it can be used to detect recovery. Different rainfall simulations were applied to two species of Sphagnum to assess the impact of drought on carbon function. After 80 days all samples were rewetted to assess recovery. The rainfall simulations included inputs analogous to actual precipitation at the field site (Forsinard Flows reserve, Northern Scotland), potential future changes in rainfall, and extended total drought. During the experiment gross primary productivity and respiration were measured. Photosynthesis decreased after approximately 30 days of continuous drought (i.e., days without rain). Spectral reflectance was measured to assess Sphagnum bleaching. The spectral absorption feature of Sphagnum associated with red light (around 650 nm) was affected by drought and did not recover after rewetting during the experimental period. No significant difference was found between the two Sphagnum species studied with respect to their photosynthesis or respiration, but there was a significant difference in optimum water content and spectral reflectance between the two. The results from this study suggest that Sphagnum carbon function is resilient to quite long drought periods, but once damage has occurred recovery is likely to be difficult. The spectral reflectance of Sphagnum can give useful information in assessing whether significant desiccation damage has occurred.

AB Mangrove forests are among the world's most productive and carbon-rich ecosystems. Despite growing understanding of factors controlling mangrove forest soil carbon stocks, there is a need to advance understanding of the speed of peat development beneath maturing mangrove forests, especially in created and restored mangrove forests that are intended to compensate for ecosystem functions lost during mangrove forest conversion to other land uses. To better quantify the rate of soil organic matter development beneath created, maturing mangrove forests, we measured ecosystem changes across a 25-yr chronosequence. We compared ecosystem properties in created, maturing mangrove forests to adjacent natural mangrove forests. We also quantified site-specific changes that occurred between 2010 and 2016. Soil organic matter accumulated rapidly beneath maturing mangrove forests as sandy soils transitioned to organic-rich soils (peat). Within 25 yr, a 20-cm deep peat layer developed. The time required for created mangrove forests to reach equivalency with natural mangrove forests was estimated as (1) <15 yr for herbaceous and juvenile vegetation, (2) ~55 yr for adult trees, (3) ~25 yr for the upper soil layer (0-10 cm), and (4) ~45-80 yr for the lower soil layer (10-30 cm). For soil elevation change, the created mangrove forests were equivalent to or surpassed natural mangrove forests within the first 5 yr. A comparison to chronosequence studies from other ecosystems indicates that the rate of soil organic matter accumulation beneath maturing mangrove forests may be among the fastest globally. In most peatland ecosystems, soil organic matter formation occurs slowly (over centuries, millennia); however, these results show that mangrove peat formation can occur within decades. Peat development, primarily due to subsurface root accumulation, enables mangrove forests to sequester carbon, adjust their elevation relative to sea level, and adapt to changing conditions at the dynamic land-ocean interface. In the face of climate change and rising sea levels, coastal managers are increasingly concerned with the longevity and functionality of coastal restoration efforts. Our results advance understanding of the pace of ecosystem development in created, maturing mangrove forests, which can improve predictions of mangrove forest responses to global change and ecosystem restoration.

AB Substantive progress has been made in extracting germanium, gallium, rare earth elements (REEs), lithium, and other metals from coal. Coal deposits are becoming important sources of many strategic metal resources. However, ore deposit theory study for coal-metal resources has not been systematic. This paper summarizes the mineralization characteristics of germanium, gallium, lithium, and REEs in coal on the basis of previous research results and field investigations, including those on seven metallogenic zones of coal metal deposits in China.
   Coal-germanium deposits, products of magmatic hydrothermal activity, mainly occur in low rank coal in the areas of Erlian, the Hailaer Basin, Inner Mongolia, and the Sanjiang district in the Yunnan Province. Occasionally, rich-germanium-coal can be found in other areas. Coal-gallium deposits are mainly in the Permian coal of North China, Jurassic coal of Northwest China, and late-Permian coal of South China. The accumulation of gallium in coal is closely related to aluminum-containing minerals. Coal-lithium deposits mainly occur in the Zhungeer coal field, Inner Mongolia, the Pingshuo coal field, and the Jingcheng coal field in the Shanxi Province, and some coal fields in South China. Similarly to gallium, the accumulation of lithium in coal is also closely related to aluminum-containing minerals. Coal-REE deposits mainly occur in the Early Jurassic coal of the Erlian Basin and Inner Mongolia, and Late Permian coal in South China. REEs of Erlian basin coal likely entered in ionic forms in early stages of coal or peat bog formation. REEs of South China coal are likely associated with REE-rich trass volcanic ash which deposited synchronously with peat bog accumulation.
   Abundant abnormal metal elements in coal are important for classification of metallogenic zones. Regional tectonic background and evolution, characteristics of stratigraphic sedimentary environment, and coal quality are also important factors.
   (1) Delineation of germanium metallogenic zones in the coal follows the principles that: coal in the coal area should be low-metamorphic bituminous (long-flame) coal; the basement of the coal-bearing basin was broken and faults developed in the region; and there are obvious traces of hydrothermal intrusion in or around the coal measures in the zone.
   (2) Delineation of gallium metallogenic zones in coal is based on these traits: an obvious gallium source should exist in the region; the provenance area has favorable weathering and denudation conditions; and an aluminum-gallium formation under strong leaching is contained within.
   (3) Delineation of lithium metallogenic zones in coal requires: relatively clear sources of lithium in the zones; favorable weathering and denudation conditions in the provenance area; and aluminum-lithium containing rocks under strong leaching.
   (4) Delineation of rare earth mineralization zones in coal is based on: large scale volcanic eruptions in or near peat bogs during the accumulation period, with tuff in the coal-bearing strata; and hydrothermal intrusion into coal-measure strata during the peat bog period or early coal-forming period.
   According to the principles above, seven coal-metal metallogenic zones were identified, including: (1) the Erlian Basin-Hailaer Basin coal-germanium and REE deposit zone; (2) the Tianshan coal-gallium deposit zone; (3) the South-Yinshan coal-gallium-lithium deposit zone; (4) the East-Taihang Mountain coal-gallium deposit zone; (5) the Qilian-Qinling coal-gallium-lithium deposit zone; (6) the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guangxi coal-gallium-lithium and REE deposit zone; and (7) the Sanjiang (west Yunnan Province) germanium deposit zone.

AB Background: Successional paludification, a dynamic process that leads to the formation of peatlands, is influenced by climatic factors and site features such as surficial deposits and soil texture. In boreal regions, projected climate change and corresponding modifications in natural fire regimes are expected to influence the paludification process and forest development. The objective of this study was to forecast the development of boreal paludified forests in northeastern North America in relation to climate change and modifications in the natural fire regime for the period 2011-2100.
   Methods: A paludification index was built using static (e.g. surficial deposits and soil texture) and dynamic (e.g. moisture regime and soil organic layer thickness) stand scale factors available from forest maps. The index considered the effects of three temperature increase scenarios (i.e. + 1 degrees C, + 3 degrees C and + 6 degrees C) and progressively decreasing fire cycle (from 300 years for 2011-2041, to 200 years for 2071-2100) on peat accumulation rate and soil organic layer (SOL) thickness at the stand level, and paludification at the landscape level.
   Results: Our index show that in the context where in the absence of fire the landscape continues to paludify, the negative effect of climate change on peat accumulation resulted in little modification to SOL thickness at the stand level, and no change in the paludification level of the study area between 2011 and 2100. However, including decreasing fire cycle to the index resulted in declines in paludified area. Overall, the index predicts a slight to moderate decrease in the area covered by paludified forests in 2100, with slower rates of paludification.
   Conclusions: Slower paludification rates imply greater forest productivity and a greater potential for forest harvest, but also a gradual loss of open paludified stands, which could impact the carbon balance in paludified landscapes. Nonetheless, as the thick Sphagnum layer typical of paludified forests may protect soil organic layer from drought and deep burns, a significant proportion of the territory has high potential to remain a carbon sink.

AB Purpose The quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) in the wetlands and peatlands are important for evaluating of the effects of environmental changes. This study's aim was to evaluate the change in the chemical properties of SOM and dissolved organic matter (DOM) during a constant temperature incubation of high-moor peat soil under two types of vegetation. Materials and methods Incubation of high-moor peat soils collected from marsh vegetation and dwarf bamboo was conducted for 108 days at each temperature of 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The chemical properties of alkaline extract and DOM in soil samples during incubation were analyzed by tetramethylammonium hydroxide thermochemolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TMAH-GC/MS) and fluorescence analysis. Results and discussion The cumulative CO2 emission from peat under dwarf bamboo was higher than that of peat under marsh vegetation. During incubation at 35 degrees C, plant and microbial residues in DOM extracted from dwarf bamboo soil were increased significantly at the early stages of culture. On the other hand, the components of DOM in the marsh vegetation soil sample did not significantly change between incubation at each temperature. The fluorescence spectra showed that protein-like fluorescent DOM contained in dwarf bamboo soil is consumed by microorganisms, which promotes leaching of humic-like fluorescent DOM and carbon mineralization during the incubation period at a higher temperature. Conclusions Compared with marsh vegetation soil, the DOM in dwarf bamboo soil is susceptible to temperature rises and can be a larger source of CO2 emissions. This study shows that evaluation of DOM properties in soil could be useful to assess the effect of climate change on soil environment.

AB Strata of the Lower Cretaceous McMurray Formation in the McMurray Sub-Basin (MSB) of Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, comprise marginal marine, tidal-fluvial, fluvial and interfluve deposits. In the Firebag Tributary located in the northeastern portion of the sub-basin, a thick coal seam (up to > 20 m) forms a semi continuous bed at the top of the lowermost McMurray Fm deposits (herein referred to as Lower McMurray). In coastal plain settings, peat-forming mires are highly sensitive archives of base-level. We investigate the stratigraphic significance of coals in the Firebag Tributary by analyzing coal petrography (4 cores), coal geochemistry (2 cores), and coal distribution in similar to 4500 wells. Additionally, we record the first absolute age for the McMurray Fm through the dating of an ash layer within the coal seam.
   The petrographic character and distribution of coals in the northeastern part of the MSB suggest a complex history of base-level rise at the end of Lower McMurray deposition. Wetting-upward character coal seams record initial transgression of the Boreal Sea during a 4th order sea level rise (Milankovitch-scale) within lowstand to early transgressive systems tract conditions. Sea-level rise during Lower McMurray times was estimated based on temperate climate peat formation rates, as well as peat-to-coal compaction factors, and probably occurred on a scale of 0.5-3 mm a(-1). Seam-internal wetting-upward cycles suggest that base-level rise was punctuated. Locally, compound and drying-upward character coals represent zones of high accommodation, wherein peat accumulation in mires was influenced by phases of syn-depositional subsidence and karst collapse. The thickest coals in the study area form an arc on a coastal plain as the Boreal Sea inundated east- to southeastward into the Firebag Tributary. Within the arc of thick coals, a north-south decrease in coal thickness is interpreted to reflect the general southward inundation of the Boreal Sea across the MSB. Exceptionally thick coals (> 10 m) likely formed where basement processes (e.g., karsting in Devonian carbonates) provided preferential groundwater pathways.
   Chemical abrasion thermal ionization mass spectrometry dating of 5 sharply faceted zircons recovered from an ash bed within the coal provides the first absolute age (121.39 +/- 0.2 Ma - Aptian) to the southward transgression of the Boreal Sea. We hypothesize that initial inundation of the MSB was related to tectonic activity in the Canadian Cordillera and the onset of magmatic flow in the western Coast Plutonic Complex.

AB Drained organic soils are considered to be hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Arable lands and intensively used grasslands, in particular, have been regarded as the main producers of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, GHG balances of former peatlands and associated organic soils not considered to be peatland according to the definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have not been investigated so far. Therefore, our study addressed the question to what extent the soil organic carbon (SOC) content affects the GHG release of drained organic soils under two different landuse types (arable land and intensively used grassland). Both land-use types were established on a Mollic Gleysol (labeled C-medium) as well as on a Sapric Histosol (labeled C-high). The two soil types differed significantly in their SOC contents in the topsoil (C-medium: 9.4-10.9% SOC; Chigh: 16.117.2% SOC). We determined GHG fluxes over a period of 1 or 2 years in case of N2O or methane (CH4) and CO2, respectively. The daily and annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was determined by measuring NEE and the ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) with the closed dynamic chamber technique and by modeling the R-ECO and the gross primary production (GPP). N2O and CH4 were measured with the static closed chamber technique. Estimated NEE of CO2 differed significantly between the two land-use types, with lower NEE values (6 to 1707 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1)) at the arable sites and higher values (1354 to 1823 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)) at the grassland sites. No effect on NEE was found regarding the SOC content. Significantly higher annual N2O exchange rates were observed at the arable sites (0.23-0.86 g Nm(-2) yr(-1)) than at the grassland sites (0.12-0.31 g Nm(-2) yr(-1)). Furthermore, N2O fluxes from the Chigh sites significantly exceeded those of the C-medium sites. CH4 fluxes were found to be close to zero at all plots. Estimated global warming potential, calculated for a time horizon of 100 years (GWP(100)) revealed a very high release of GHGs from all plots ranging from 1837 to 7095 g CO2 (eq). m(-2) yr(-1). Calculated global warming potential (GWP) values did not differ between soil types and partly exceeded the IPCC default emission factors of the Tier 1 approach by far. However, despite being subject to high uncertainties, the results clearly highlight the importance of adjusting the IPCC guidelines for organic soils not falling under the definition in order to avoid a significant underestimation of GHG emissions in the corresponding sectors of the national climate reporting. Furthermore, the present results revealed that mainly the type of land-use, including the management type, and not the SOC content is responsible for the height of GHG exchange from intensive farming on drained organic soils.

AB Unravelling the role of structural and environmental drivers of gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R (eco)) in highly heterogeneous tundra is a major challenge for the upscaling of chamber-based CO2 fluxes in Arctic landscapes. In a mountain birch woodland-mire ecotone, we investigated the role of LAI (and NDVI), environmental factors (microclimate, soil moisture), and microsite type across tundra shrub plots (wet hummocks, dry hummocks, dry hollows) and lichen hummocks, in controlling net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). During a growing season, we measured NEE fluxes continuously, with closed dynamic chambers, and performed multiple fits (one for each 3-day period) of a simple light and temperature response model to hourly NEE data. Tundra shrub plots were largely CO2 sinks, as opposed to lichen plots, although fluxes were highly variable within microsite type. For tundra shrub plots, microsite type did not influence photosynthetic parameters but it affected basal (that is, temperature-normalized) ecosystem respiration (R (0)). PAR-normalized photosynthesis (P (600)) increased with air temperature and declined with increasing vapor pressure deficit. R (0) declined with soil moisture and showed an apparent increase with temperature, which may underlie a tight link between GPP and R (eco). NDVI was a good proxy for LAI, maximum P (600) and maximum R (0) of shrub plots. Cumulative CO2 fluxes were strongly correlated with LAI (NDVI) but we observed a comparatively low GPP/LAI in dry hummocks. Our results broadly agree with the reported functional convergence across tundra vegetation, but here we show that the role of decreased productivity in transition zones and the influence of temperature and water balance on seasonal CO2 fluxes in sub-Arctic forest-mire ecotones cannot be overlooked.

AB Anecdotal information has linked cool air temperatures before harvest with increased phenolic production in cranberry; however, there is little information available on the effect of temperature on phenolic production in cranberry fruit. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of air temperature throughout the growing season on the concentration of total anthocyanins, total flavonols, and total phenolics at harvest in fruit from seven 'Early Black' bogs in southeastern Massachusetts. Contrary to the anecdotal information available, correlations of temperature to fruit composition indicated that warmer temperatures early in the season (around bloom and fruit set) had the most positive impact on total anthocyanins and total flavonols. Total phenolic concentration in the harvested fruit was impacted by air temperature in the preharvest period; however, that relationship was positive.

AB In the Oberdorf trough at the northwestern margin of the Styrian Basin (Austria), an up to 36-m thick Lower Miocene (Ottnangian) lignite scam occurs within the fluvial Koflach-Voitsberg Formation. Previous results indicate that the lignite originated in a topogenous mire within a wet-forest swamp palacoenvironment. Differences in soluble organic matter (SOM) yield of borehole samples from the lignite seam are related to free lipids present in plant waxes or resins and the presence of thermally labile polymers indicated by the contents of liptinite macerals (i.e., resinite, suberinite, and liptodetrinite). The n-alkane distribution patterns are dominated by high-molecular weight lipids with marked odd over even predominance, originating from plant waxes. A contribution of algae to the even numbered short-chain lipids, observed in considerable amounts in the footwall sediments is proposed. Terpenoid biomarkers characteristic for conifers and angiosperm s were detected, consistent with palynomorphic spectra which are dominated by forest swamp pollen (Taxodiaccae-Cupressaceae) and pollen from plants living in a mixed mesophytic forest. Excellent relationships between higher plant biomarker composition and palynologic data indicate that the organic geochemical results reflect the varying inputs of coniferales vs. angiosperms. The data further imply that cuparene may be used for taxonomical differentiation of coniferales families. Organic geochemical data provide evidence that the content of land plant-derived biomarkers is controlled by the input of resin-rich conifers. Concentrations of hopanoids, dominated by hop-17(21)-ene, generally increase towards the top of the lignite, a section characterised by high extents of aromatisation of triterpenoid biomarkers. The results suggest that the aromatisation of angiosperm-derived biomarkers may be governed by the activity of anaerobic rather than by aerobic bacteria. However, changes in the depositional environment and palynologic facies during peat formation probably influenced the origin and fate of angiosperm-derived triterpenoids. The results indicate how biomarker composition may contribute to the evaluation of environmental changes. Cross-correlations of organic geochemical parameters with palynological data and petrography-based facies indicators will provide further insights in the peat-forming vegetation and biogeochemical activities in the mire.

ID SWEET-POTATO
AB Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) cultivars, Carver, Potojam, Jewel and Centennial were evaluated for slip production, using topsoil, sawdust, sand and a general-purpose peat-based commercial growing media as bed covers. Temperature measured 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the surface of the hot bed varied with covers and date measured. Sand maintained the highest bed temperature, 77 degreesF (25.0 degreesC) at 0800 HR and 79 degreesF (26.1 degreesC) at 1400 HR, throughout the growing season. Peat-covered roots produced the maximum number of slips/plot (111), while roots covered with topsoil and sawdust produced comparable yields, 55 and 45 slips/plot, respectively. Slip production varied according to harvest date, with the third harvest producing the most slips/plot (83 and 153, in year I and year 2, respectively), which, was likely related to increased temperatures. Cultivar significantly influenced number of slips, length of slips, and number of roots per slip. 'Potojam' was the most prolific slip producer for both early and mid season production under all bed covers.

AB indigenous soil macroinvertebrates (moth larvae, weevil larvae, earthworms) are cardinal agents of nutrient release from litter on sub-Antarctic Marion Island (47 degrees S, 38 degrees'E). Their populations are threatened through predation by introduced house mice, which do not prey on an introduced slug Deroceras panormitanum. A microcosm study was carried out to explore whether slugs affect rates of carbon and inorganic nutrient mineralisation from plant litter differently to an indigenous caterpillar (larva of a flightless moth Pringelophaga marioni). Caterpillars stimulated N, Ca, Mg and K mineralisation from plant litter two to five times more than slugs did, whereas the two invertebrate types stimulated C and P mineralisation to the same degree. Consequently, ratios of C:N and N:P released from the litter were different for slugs and caterpillars. Such differences might affect peat nutrient quality and ultimately the peat accumulation-decomposition balance, an important driver of ecological succession. This suggests that slugs cannot simply replace caterpillars without consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning on the island. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB At the southern margin of permafrost in North America, climate change causes widespread permafrost thaw. In boreal lowlands, thawing forested permafrost peat plateaus ('forest') lead to expansion of permafrost-free wetlands ('wetland'). Expanding wetland area with saturated and warmer organic soils is expected to increase landscape methane (CH4) emissions. Here, we quantify the thaw-induced increase in CH4 emissions for a boreal forest-wetland landscape in the southern Taiga Plains, Canada, and evaluate its impact on net radiative forcing relative to potential long-term net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange. Using nested wetland and landscape eddy covariance net CH4 flux measurements in combination with flux footprint modeling, we find that landscape CH4 emissions increase with increasing wetland-to-forest ratio. Landscape CH4 emissions are most sensitive to this ratio during peak emission periods, when wetland soils are up to 10 degrees C warmer than forest soils. The cumulative growing season (May-October) wetland CH4 emission of similar to 13 g CH4 m(-2) is the dominating contribution to the landscape CH4 emission of similar to 7 g CH4 m(-2). In contrast, forest contributions to landscape CH4 emissions appear to be negligible. The rapid wetland expansion of 0.26 +/- 0.05% yr(-1) in this region causes an estimated growing season increase of 0.034 +/- 0.007 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in landscape CH4 emissions. A long-term net CO2 uptake of >200 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) is required to offset the positive radiative forcing of increasing CH4 emissions until the end of the 21st century as indicated by an atmospheric CH4 and CO2 concentration model. However, long-term apparent carbon accumulation rates in similar boreal forest-wetland landscapes and eddy covariance landscape net CO2 flux measurements suggest a long-term net CO2 uptake between 49 and 157 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). Thus, thaw-induced CH4 emission increases likely exert a positive net radiative greenhouse gas forcing through the 21st century.

AB A multi-proxy reconstruction of water depth, temperature and precipitation inferred from Cladocera, Chironomidae and pollen assemblages has been obtained from Swierczyna paleo-oxbow (central Poland) during the Younger Dryas (YD) and Early Holocene. Results suggest that the YD was relatively cold and comprised two main phases. The first (ca. 12,500-12,000 cal. yrs BP) is characterized by a continental climatic regime and a decrease in winter temperatures and precipitation but an increase in spring/summer precipitation. The second phase (ca. 12,000-11,500 cal. yrs BP) was more mild with a variable continental climate, an increase in summer and winter temperature, a lengthening of the growing season and increased annual precipitation. The reconstructed water level generally follows changes in spring and summer precipitation and length of growing season. The frequency and timing of hydroclimatic oscillations at Swierczyna show strong similarities to records from other sites in Europe. This confirms that oxbows and valley mire ecosystems respond to rapid climate change during the YD and Early Holocene. This study therefore brings new insights into the effects of climate changes on river environments, especially during the YD. We also discuss the limitations of water depth, temperature and precipitation reconstructions inferred from the studied biotic assemblages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growing season requirement is an often overlooked part of the definition for hydric soils. The current technical definition for a hydric soil states that flooding or soil saturation must occur during the portion of the year when soil temperature at 50 cm is > 5 degrees C. In this study, we defined the portion of year when soils were > 5 degrees C at 50 cm as the microbial activity season and reserved the term growing season for plant activity. In the technical criteria for hydric soils, specific microbial activity season months have been assigned to each of the soil temperature regimes. Our objectives were to determine the portion of the year when southeastern U.S. hydric soils are < 5 degrees C at 50 cm and to estimate rates of microbial activity during winter flooding. We found that 34 bottomland hardwood forest soils in South Carolina, Louisiana, and Mississippi were never < 5 degrees C at 50 cm during a period of 2 to 3 yr. Also, winter rates of soil respiration and O-2 consumption (1.6 mL O-2 L(-1) air d(-1)) are apparently sufficient to cause anoxia in saturated soils. Based on the available data, we recommend a 12-mo microbial activity season for southeastern bottomland hardwood forests. Additional data will be necessary to determine the relationships between temperature, soil saturation, and development of redoximorphic features in southeastern soils.

TI REMOVAL OF TOTAL PHOSPHORUS AND PHOSPHATE BY PEAT SOILS OF THE FLORIDA
   EVERGLADES
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Traditional estimates of soil and sediment phosphorus retention are based on orthophosphate (PO4) removal from water by soil or sediment columns under saturated water flow.  These techniques may not reflect the P uptake of in situ soils accurately because the PO4 concentration of through-flowing water is often below detection limits in nonpolluted wetlands during the growing season.  We used peat soils from the Florida Everglades in saturated flow and equilibrium sorption experiments to show that the uptake of PO4 reaches saturation quickly, potentially underestimating soil P binding capacity when compared with total phosphorus (TP) retention.  The rate of TP uptake was constant for 2 d, while the rate of PO4 uptake slowed and followed saturation kinetics.  The majority of the TP removed was associated with particles within a 1-20-mu-m size range.  Experiments using both NaCl and nonionic detergent (Triton X-100) as well as batch equilibrium sorption studies indicate that the primary mechanism for TP removal by these soils is not straining.  Removal of TP by these soils appears to involve abiotic mechanisms that include both hydrophobic and ionic interactions.

AB A combination of stable isotope studies and C-14 dating were used to identify the main sources and processes controlling streamwater DOC and TIC in a temperate non-forested watershed. delta C-13 values for terrestrial (-24.9 to -29.1 parts per thousand) and aquatic (-30.5 to -33.5 parts per thousand) plants were similar to values reported in the literature for similar ecosystems. delta C-13 values for DOC in soil solution and streamwater were consistent with soil and terrestrial vegetation, indicating that the terrestrial ecosystem is the dominant source of aquatic DOC in this watershed. delta C-13 values of soil atmosphere CO2 (-17.2 to -25.2 parts per thousand) were slightly less negative than would be expected for production via aerobic soil microbial decomposition and root respiration. There was a close correspondence between delta C-13 values (-15.5 to -21.5 parts per thousand) for streamwater TIC and soil atmospheric CO2 in the central part of the catchment where the stream drains CO2-rich peats. C-14 dating showed that although peat has been accumulating in the watershed for at least 2700 years, DOC in soil pore water and streamwater contains carbon of predominantly recent origin (post-AD 1955).

ID ASSEMBLAGES; DEPOSITS
AB A record of polar Eocene forests is preserved as in situ tree-stump fields and leaf-litter mats in Buchanan Lake Formation sediments on Axel Heiberg Island, in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Stratigraphic examination at the centimetre to metre scale of peat-coal lithology and macrofossil floristics in two levels of these fossil forests reflects small-scale changes in forest composition and swamp hydrology horizontally and temporal variation vertically. Root system structure and tree base stratigraphy suggest that exposed tree stumps may not include only coeval individuals of a single forest stand, but rather also individuals representing different phases of the forest through one cycle of the hydrological development of this Eocene polar forest community. Earlier calculations of stand density and biomass, based upon the assumption that all stumps represent coeval trees, may therefore be greatly overestimated.

AB In Ireland, upland areas are becoming extensively planted with coniferous forest to which sheep are allowed access.  Such forest produces many more fruiting bodies of basidiomycetes than the blanket bog on which it was planted.  Faecal samples taken from hill and adjacent forest (Picea abies) grazing areas showed an autumnal increase in radiocaesium in the forest samples compared with the hill samples, and there was an indication of higher in vivo radiocaesium activity in the autumn, particularly in individual animals which are known to graze the forest.  The peak faecal and in vivo radiocaesium levels coincided with the fungal growing season.  A new method is presented using fungal spores, which proves the ingestion of fungi by sheep and permits the identification and quantification of the fungi consumed.

AB This study presents detailed lithostratigraphy and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic variations in a 520-cm-long sediment core from a cirque basin in the LabskA1/2 dA-l Valley, Krkonoe Mountains, Czech Republic. Detailed study of the core reveals five major periods of sedimentation during the last 7600 years: silt and sand deposition during similar to 7.6-5.1 ka cal BP, Sphagnum peat accumulation during similar to 5.1-4.0 ka cal BP, sandy silt and sand during similar to 4.0-2.8 ka cal BP, raised peat bog during similar to 2.8-2.0 ka cal BP (Sphagnum peat), and sedimentation of sandy silt since similar to 2.0 ka cal BP. The delta C-13 values of the organic matter in the core vary in the range typical for C3 plants, from -24.35 to -27.68aEuro degrees, whereas the delta N-15 values vary from -2.65 to +4.35aEuro degrees. Core sections having ash contents a parts per thousand yen70% have delta N-15 > 1aEuro degrees and delta C-13 < -26aEuro degrees, whereas those having a parts per thousand currency sign70% ash content have delta N-15 < 1aEuro degrees and delta C-13 > -26aEuro degrees. Strong linear correlations are observed between delta C-13 and delta N-15 values as well as between C:N ratios and delta N-15 values in the horizons with ash content > 10%, primarily for sand and silt horizons. On the other hand, poor correlations between delta C-13 and C:N ratio, as well as delta N-15 and C:N ratio, were observed in Sphagnum peat layers (45-125 and 185-265 cm). We conclude that the primary stable isotope variations are not preserved in the layers where significant correlation between delta N-15 and C:N ratio is observed. The relatively small delta C-13 variation in the uppermost Sphagnum peat layer suggests stable temperature during similar to 2.8-2.0 ka cal BP.

TI SELECTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF EXTRACTANTS USED TO RELEASE METALS
   ASSOCIATED WITH ORGANIC-MATTER
SO APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Partial extraction procedures can be used to release metals associated with organic matter in natural materials.  Reagents commonly employed for this purpose include hydrogen peroxide, Na hypochlorite and Na pyrophosphate.  This study tested the selectivity of these reagents by comparing the amount of Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu they released from sulfide and oxide minerals and determined the ability of these reagents to release the same metals from peat.  Sodium hypochlorite and Na pyrophosphate released between 0.2 and 8.7% of the total metal content of the Fe, Cu and Zn minerals.  In contrast, three commonly used hydrogen peroxide reagents released significantly more metals from the oxides and sulfides.  Percentages of Zn and Mn released from the peat samples were comparable for all extractions tested.  Per cent Cu released from peat by Na pyrophosphate was very low compared to that released by hydrogen peroxide/HNO3 or Na hypochlorite.  A smaller fraction of Fe was released from peat by Na hypochlorite than by the other reagents.  Iron release by Na hypochlorite correlates with the organic carbon content of the peat samples.  A universal extractant for metals associated with organic matter in all types of samples has not been identified.  Sodium hypochlorite and Na pyrophosphate are better than hydrogen peroxide in selectively releasing metals bound to organic matter because they do not release significant amounts of metals from oxide and sulfide minerals.

AB This study compared three estimates of carbon (C) contained both in the surface layer (0-30 cm) and the total soil pools at polygon and regional scales and the spatial distribution in the three prairie provinces of western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). The soil C estimates were based on data from (i) analysis of pedon data from both the Boreal Forest Transect Case Study (BFTCS) area and from a national-scale soil profile database; (ii) the Canadian Soil Organic Carbon Database (CSOCD), which uses expert estimation based on soil characteristics; and (iii) model simulations with the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS2). At the polygon scale, good agreement was found between the CSOCD and pedon (the first method) total soil carbon values. Slightly higher total soil carbon values obtained from BFTCS averaged pedon data (the first method), as indicated by the slope of the regression line, may be related to micro- and meso-scale geomorphic and microclimate influences that are not accounted for in the CSOCD. Regional estimates of organic C from these three approaches for upland forest soils ranged from 1.4 to 7.7 kg Cm(-2) for the surface layer and 6.2 to 27.4 kg Cm(-2) for the total soil. In general, the CBM-CFS2 simulated higher soil C content compared with the field observed and CSOCD soil C estimates, but showed similar patterns in the total soil C content for the different regions. The higher soil C content simulated with CBM-CFS2 arises in part because the modelled results include forest floor detritus pool components (such as coarse woody debris, which account for 4-12% of the total soil pool in the region) that are not included in the other estimates. The comparison between the simulated values (the third method) and the values obtained from the two empirical approaches (the first two methods) provided an independent test of CBM-CFS2 soil simulations for upland forests soils. The CSOCD yielded significantly higher C content for peatland soils than for upland soils, ranging from 14.6 to 28 kg Cm(-2) for the surface layer and 60 to 181 kg Cm(-2) for the total peat soil depth. All three approaches indicated higher soil carbon content in the boreal zone than in other regions (subarctic, grassland).

AB For soils with shallow groundwater and high organic carbon content, water table depth (WTD) is a key parameter to describe their hydrologic state and to estimate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Since the microwave backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)) is sensitive to soil moisture, the application of Sentinel-1 satellite data might support the monitoring of these climate-relevant soils at high spatial resolution (similar to 100 m) by detecting spatial and temporal changes in local field and water management. Despite the low penetration depth of the C-band, sigma(0) is influenced by shallow WTD fluctuations via the soil hydraulic connection between the water table and surface soil. Here, we analyzed sigma(0) at 60 monitoring wells in a drained temperate peatland with degraded organic soils used as extensive grassland. We evaluated temporal Spearman correlation coefficients between sigma(0) and WTD considering the soil and vegetation information. To account for the effects of seasonal vegetation changes, we used the cross-over (incidence) angle method. Climatologies of the slope of the incidence angle dependency derived from two years of Sentinel-1 data and their application to the cross-over angle method did improve correlations, though the effect was minor. Overall, averaged over all sites, a temporal Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.45 (+/- 0.17) was obtained. The loss of correlation during summer (higher vegetation, deeper WTD) and the effects of cuts and grazing are discussed. The site-specific general wetness level, described by the mean WTD of each site was shown to be a major factor controlling the strength of the correlation. Mean WTD deeper than about -0.60 m lowered the correlations across sites, which might indicate an important limit of the application.

AB Proxy records from recently accumulated peats provide valuable information about past environmental change, but they depend on high quality chronological information to calculate rates and timing of change. However, there is uncertainty in the accuracy and consistency of the methodologies used for dating recent peats. This study compares results from Spheroidal Carbonaceous Particles (SCPs) and natural and anthropogenic fallout radionuclides (Pb-210, Cs-137 and Am-241) used to date three replicate cores from three contrasting sites. Data are used to test the consistency of dating techniques within and between sites, and to assess the impact of local conditions on geochronological results.
   There is broad consistency in results, but there is also a significant disagreement between dates in a number of cores, both within and between sites. A relatively dry site that had been affected by past burning and erosion showed the greatest consistency between methods and replicate cores. Wetter, less degraded sites showed least consistency. Using patterns of (dis)agreement between dating techniques we assess the potential causes of dating inaccuracy. The data support previous suggestions that Pb-210 is mobile in wetter conditions, and suggests that Am-241 can be considered an increasingly valuable radionuclide. Finally, our data suggest the current estimates for SCP-based ages in the region maybe incorrect and require further regional calibration.
   Using several techniques on replicate cores from three sites in the same area has provided a more robust evaluation of the likely reliability of individual techniques and the processes that may adversely affect them. We conclude that until advances are made in understanding the processes behind the variable quality of SCP and fallout radionuclide dating, using two or more dating techniques will greatly improve understanding of the validity of a peatland chronology, especially in wetter locations.

AB Nursery irrigation regimes that recharged container capacity when target volumetric water content reached 72%, 58%, and 44% (by volume) influenced Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex Lawson & C. Lawson growth more than either a 1: 1 (by volume) Sphagnum peat - vermiculite (PV) or a 7: 3 (by volume) Sphagnum peat - sawdust (PS) medium. Exponential fertilization avoided confounding irrigation and fertilization. Temporary nitrogen (N) immobilization in PS caused transient allometric differences prior to hardening. Subsequent release of immobilized N during the onset of hardening, when daily N flux decreased from 4.2% to 1.6%, allowed PS seedlings to avoid foliar N dilution experienced by PV seedlings. Media yielded seedlings with similar final morphological characteristics, although PS seedlings had improved N status. At onset, particle density and volumetric water content were similar for both media, but PS held about 10% more water than PV at all water potentials at experiment conclusion. Exposure to the driest water content (44%) decreased seedling growth and root N status compared with cohorts that were provided ample moisture (72%). Despite maximum tissue heterogeneity within samples and regardless of irrigation regime, seedlings became 1.3% more depleted of C-13 as the growing season progressed. Refinement of sampling procedures, with focus on ontogenetics, may improve subsequent use of stable carbon isotopes in nursery research.

AB Many protected wetlands and (especially) fen peatlands in Poland require vegetation management to restore and maintain them as breeding areas for endangered bird species. The current practice of harvesting, baling and transporting grasses, reeds and other vegetation using tracked snow groomers and wheeled farm tractors can conflict with the nature conservation goals for these sites through disturbance of the ground surface and accidents leading to spillage of oil. To address these problems, the Industrial Institute of Agricultural Engineering (PIMR) is developing new-generation agricultural machinery that will also be applicable in formal paludiculture. This article describes an innovative method for towing large bales of harvested biomass across wetlands that minimises ground pressure using any vehicle, and the development of amphibian tracked (ATV) and hovercraft vehicles for biomass harvesting operations in wetlands.

AB We have studied biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions and their ambient concentrations at a sub-Arctic wetland (Lompolojankka, Finland), which is an open, nutrient-rich sedge fen and a part of the Pallas-Sodankyla Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station. Measurements were conducted during the growing season in 2018 using an in situ thermal-desorption-gaschromatograph-mass-spectrometer (TD-GC-MS).
   Earlier studies have shown that isoprene is emitted from boreal wetlands, and it also turned out to be the most abundant compound in the current study. Monoterpene (MT) emissions were generally less than 10 % of the isoprene emissions (mean isoprene emission over the growing season, 44 mu g M-2 h(-1)), but sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions were higher than MT emissions all the time. The main MTs emitted were alpha-pinene, 1,8-cineol, myrcene, limonene and 3 Delta-carene. Of SQTs cadinene, beta-cadinene and alpha-farnesene had the major contribution. During early growing season the SQT/MT emission rate ratio was similar to 10, but it became smaller as summer proceeded, being only similar to 3 in July. Isoprene, MT and SQT emissions were exponentially dependent on temperature (correlation coefficients (R-2) 0.75, 0.66 and 0.52, respectively). Isoprene emission rates were also found to be exponentially correlated with the gross primary production of CO2 (R-2 = 0.85 in July).
   Even with the higher emissions from the wetland, ambient air concentrations of isoprene were on average > 100, > 10 and > 6 times lower than MT concentrations in May, June and July, respectively. This indicates that wetland was not the only source affecting atmospheric concentrations at the site, but surrounding coniferous forests, which are high MT emitters, contribute as well. Daily mean MT concentrations had high negative exponential correlation (R-2 = 0.96) with daily mean ozone concentrations indicating that vegetation emissions can be a significant chemical sink of ozone in this sub-Arctic area.

ID BRITISH-COLUMBIA; MACERALS; BASIN; FTIR; PALYNOLOGY; SEQUENCE; EXAMPLE
AB This study focuses on variations in petrographic composition and chemistry of macerals from different coalfields in Colombia. The coal-bearing formations in Colombia occur in the age interval from the Maastrichtian in the Upper Cretaceous to the Paleogene and Neogene (Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, and Late Pliocene) up to Early Pleistocene. The coals range in rank from lignite to semianthracite. Petrographically, the coal is composed dominantly of macerals of the vitrinite group (> 50% by volume). The coals from the regions of Antioquia, Cordoba, and Caldas are characterized by relatively high proportions of liptinite (up to 30 vol%). The inertinite contents vary up to 30 vol%, and the coals from the regions of Boyaca and Guajira contain the highest quantities of this maceral group. The Colombian coals studied have low moisture, except for the coal from Caldas being lignite type A. The sulfur content ranges between 0.28 weigh % in coal from Guajira to slightly above 2% in coal from Cordoba and Cauca.
   The coal facies diagrams suggest that palaeomires developed mostly under limno-telmatic to wet forest mire conditions. The ratios of microlithotypes suggest that the original peat mires evolved under fluvial, upper deltaic and brackish settings. Overall coal petrography data suggest that peat-forming vegetation and water tables in palaeomires experienced significant variations between the Upper Maastrichtian to Pliocene - Early Pleistocene period.
   Variations in chemistry of coal macerals reflect to large extent the coal rank variations. Specifically, with the increase in vitrinite reflectance (R-o), the contents of aliphatic functional groups decrease whereas those of the aromatic groups increase. The values of CH2/CH3 ratios also decrease with increasing coal rank (2.24 in Boyaca and 0.97 in Cauca). Expectedly, spectral differences between individual macerals are most distinct in the low rank coals (0.48% R-o).

DE Northern white cedar; stand structure; site quality; volume growth
AB The structure and growth of northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) was studied in 16 stands on wet sites in Vermont. White cedar and associate species representing the range in diameter were felled for stem analysis. Height growth curves were constructed. Structure of white cedar stands oil wet sites in Vermont is often even-aged with a relatively uniform canopy due to restocking of former agricultural land, or two-aged, or multiaged, depending oil degree of harvesting and other disturbances. On bog and swamp sites, cedar may reach less than 25 ft in height in 50 years whereas oil upland sites wet only a portion of the growing season, they may reach 50 ft or greater in height. Oil well-drained upland sites. height growth may be greater, but cedar most likely may be displaced by other conifers and hardwoods. Basal area in pure and well-stocked maturing stands may exceed 300 ft(2), and volumes can exceed 12,000 ft(3)/ac. In high-density stands, there is usualy little understory. Very small amounts of cedar regeneration it-ere observed in the stands studied. Some of the stands had a distinct browse line, and deer are presumed to have a major impact oil cedar regeneration. All cedar stands are recognized as being of great importance as deer wintering areas. Oil the low-quality swamp, and bog sites, minimal and careful harvest of cedar should be done to maintain deer habitat, integrity of the tree canopy, and associated understory vegetation. Oil sites with less water restrictions than in swamps and bogs, harvesting practices to maintain wildlife habitat and assure regeneration and thinning and pruning to improve growth rate and value of harvested wood should be considered.

AB This article hypothesizes that production and preservation of source-rock type facies in deltaic systems, both landward and seaward of a coastline, is mutually exclusive, time-successive and related to the dynamics of relative sea level. Sedimentologic research in the Holocene Mississippi and Rhone delta complexes suggests that rheotrophic peats and associated organic-rich beds preferably accumulate in the accommodation space created behind landward stepping shorelines in a transgressive systems tract (TST). Such a setting also allows for a sufficient supply of recharging fresh nutrient-rich groundwater into the peat forming mires [Kosters, E.C., Suter, J.R., 1993. Facies relationships and systems tracts in the late Holocene Mississippi Delta Plain. Journal of Sedimentary Petrology 63 (4) 727-733.]. Independently carried-out quantitative paleoecological studies in the same delta systems (and in addition in the Orinoco and Po deltas) suggest that in a progradational setting (highstand systems tract/HST), seasonally discharged nutrient- and sediment-laden river waters on the shelf may give rise to anoxia or dysoxia. Subsequent overfertilization of the shelf leads to accumulation of organic-rich mud belts on the shelf [VanderZwaan, G.J., Jorissen, F.J., 1991. Biofacial patterns in river-induced anoxia. In: Tyson, R.V., Pearson, T.H. (Eds.), Modern and Ancient Continental Shelf Anoxia. Geological Society of London, Special Publication no. 58, pp. 65-82.]. Thus, production and preservation of source-rock type facies landward of a shoreline (as peats and related sediments) is preferred in a TST, when accommodation space and nutrient supply are landward of the shoreline. Vice versa, production and preservation of such facies seaward of a shoreline (as organic-rich shelf muds) occurs preferentially in a highstand systems tract. In that situation, accommodation space is on the shelf, where river-fed nutrients are supplied as well. This hypothesis suggests further potential for application of sequence stratigraphic concepts for improved understanding of the occurrence of source-rock type facies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Snow amount is expected to decline in the Northern hemisphere as an effect of climate warming. However, snow amount in alpine regions will probably undergo stronger interannual fluctuations than elsewhere. We set up a short-term (1 year) experiment in which we manipulated snow cover in an alpine bog, with the following protocol: snow removal at the end of winter; snow removal in spring; snow addition in spring; removal of all aboveground plant tissues with no snow manipulation; no manipulation at all. We measured, at different dates from late spring to early autumn: ecosystem respiration (ER), and concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the soil and in microbes. We hypothesized that longer duration of snow cover will lead to: i) higher ER rates associated with increased microbial biomass; and ii) decreased soil nutrient availability. Contrary to our first hypothesis, ER and microbial C content were unaffected by the snow cover manipulations, probably because ER was decoupled from microbial biomass especially in summer, when CO2 efflux was dominated by autotrophic respiration. Our second hypothesis also was partially contradicted because nutrient content in the soil and in plants did not vary in relation to snow cover. However, we observed unexpected effects of snow cover manipulations on the N : P ratio in the microbial biomass, which declined after increasing snow cover. This probably depended on stimulation of microbial activity, which enhanced absorption of P, rather than N, by microbes. This may eventually reduce P availability for plant uptake.

AB This study aims to determine the extent to which the accumulation rates of Cu, Ni, Co, Zn, and Cd in peat cores agree with established histories of atmospheric emission from local point sources. Metals accumulating in three Finnish peat cores with known metal deposition histories have been measured using inductively coupled plasma-sector field mass spectrometry. Samples were age-dated using both Pb-210 and C-14 (bomb pulse curve). At the Outokumpu (OUT) site as well as the low-background site Hietajarvi (HIJ), Pb-210 age dates are in excellent agreement with the C-14 bomb pulse curve method results, and the precision is between 1 and 10 years for most of the samples; at the Harjavalta (HAR) site, precision is > 6 years. Mean regional "background" concentrations have been calculated from deeper peat layers of the HIJ site (mu g g(-1)): Cu, 1.3 +/- 0.2 (n = 62); Co, 0.25 +/- 0.04 (n = 71); Cd, 0.08 +/- 0.01 (n = 23); and Zn, 4 +/- 2 (n = 40). For layers accumulated within the past 100 years, accumulation rates (ARs) have been calculated. At sites with < 0.06 g m(-2) cumulative Ni inventory (HIJ and OUT), ARs of Cu and Co trace the known metal deposition histories very well. At HAR, where metal inventories are much greater, Cu and Cc are mobile. AIRS of Zn were between 3 and 30 mg m(-2) year(-1) and those of Cd between 24 and 140 mu g m(-2) year(-1) at all sites and are independent of the chronology of their inputs from the atmosphere.

AB This paper describes a new bio-indicator method for assessing wetland ecosystem health: as such, the study is particularly relevant to current legislation such as the EU Water Framework Directive, which provides a baseline of the current status Of Surface waters. Seven wetland sites were monitored across northern Britain, with model construction data for predicting, eco-hydroloplical relationships collected from five sites during 1999, Two new sites and one repeat site were monitored during 2000 to provide model test data. The main growing season for the vegetation, and hence the sampling period, was May-August during both years. Seasonal mean concentrations of nitrate (NO3-) in surface and soil water samples during 1999 ranged from 0.01 to 14.07 mg N 1(-1), with a mean value of 1.01 mg N 1(-1). During 2000, concentrations ranged from trace level (<0.01 m- N 1(-1)) to 9.43 mg N 1(-1), with a mean of 2.73 mg N 1(.)(-1) Surface and soil-water nitrate concentrations did not influence plant species composition significantly across representative tall herb fen and mire communities. Predictive relationships were found between nitrate concentrations and structural characteristics of the wetland vegetation, and a model was developed which predicted nitrate concentrations from measures of plant diversity, canopy structure and density of reproductive structures. Two further models, which predicted stem density and density of reproductive structures respectively, utilised nitrate concentration as one of the independent predictor variables. Where appropriate, the models were tested using data collected during 2000. This approach is complementary to species-based monitoring, representing a useful and simple too] to assess ecological status in target wetland systems and has potential for bio-indication purposes.

AB To reduce the quantity of irrigation water used and the amount of mineral nutrients lost because of leaching, we used time domain reflectometry to monitor and maintain four irrigation regimes (15, 30, 45 and 60%, v/v) during the first growing season for 1+0 black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) seedlings. The seedlings were produced in air-slit containers (IPL 25-350A), filled with a peat substrate and were grown under a polyethylene tunnel at a forest nursery. Similar fertility levels were maintained in all four irrigation regimes even though the water content of the substrate could be very low (15 and 30%). Irrigation regime did not affect growth, root architecture or tissue nutrient contents at the end of the growing season. Monitoring water use over the course of the growing season clearly showed that the amount of irrigation water could be reduced by 62 to 76% without compromising seedling quality relative to the 60% irrigation regime. Leachate losses varied exponentially as a function of irrigation regime. The mean amount of water leached, relative to the quantity of water applied during the sampling period, was 10, 7.1, 28.4, and 62.2% for the 15, 30, 45, and 60% irrigation regimes, respectively. The losses of mineral nitrogen at the beginning of August were 49.7, 35.9, 55.2, and 88.2%, respectively, for the 15, 30, 45, and 60% irrigation regimes.. To optimize irrigation and decrease leaching, a dynamic model for irrigation management is proposed that accounts for the phenological development of black spruce seedlings grown under tunnel conditions in forest nurseries.

ID AMENDED MEDIA
AB Ornamental nurseries extensively utilize peat in commercial soilless potting media, but its use as an organic amendment with a superior water holding capacity is challenged by economic and environmental pressures so potential alternatives to peat need to be investigated. In our experiment, commercially available peat-based soilless mixes were amended with increasing composted green waste (CGW) percentages. Results on Photinia X fraseri and Viburnum tinus suggest that CGW could partially substitute peat in containerized nursery production, with a different effectiveness related to species behavior. Viburnum seemed to be less affected by CGW addition (only CGW-based media, T-100, showed a significant difference compared to peat-based media, used as control), which on the contrary hardly affected Photinia growth in terms of biomass production and quality. On the other hand, a higher CGW content (75% or 100%) also improved plant susceptibility to water shortage. Concluding, peat-based media partially amended with CGW may have positive agronomic and economic consequences for commercial ornamental nursery production.

AB The base-buffering properties of native and agrogenically transformed dark-humus gley soils of the Khanka Valley were studied using the method of equilibrium potentiometric titration. The major buffering systems of the soils under study were characterized. The highest base-buffering capacity was observed in the humus horizon of the dark-humus gley soil, where correlations between the buffer intensity, the exchangeable and total acidities, and the carbon content were revealed. In the agrogenically transformed soil, the base-buffering capacity decreased by an order of magnitude.

AB Plants play an important role in CH4 emissions from wetlands. Vascular plants transport CH4 from the anaerobic zone to the atmosphere through their aerenchyma, thereby bypassing the aerobic zone and strongly increasing CH4 emission rates. However, most studies of the effect of plants on wetland CH4 emissions are based on observations made during the growing seasons. The effects in non-growing seasons are still unclear. In this study, we conducted a clipping experiment to investigate the effects of plants on CH4 emissions from a temperate marsh in the growing and non-growing seasons. The results show that the influence of plants on CH4 emissions from the wetland varied among different seasons. Plant-mediated CH4 accounted for 38% of the total fluxes in the plant-growing season. After the growing season, whether the plants transported CH4 from the soil to the atmosphere in situ was determined by the involved environmental conditions. In autumn, the plants did not transport CH4. This is because the CH4 diffused easily in the soil and water, rather than via the plants' organs. In the surface soil freezing period, CH4 diffusion was blocked and accumulated under the frozen surface. The highly concentrated CH4 in the pore water was compelled to enter the organs of the plants and diffused by them. The 'passive diffusion' via plants transported 84% of the total CH4 emissions during this period. Nonetheless, the plants did not transport CH4 again in the deep soil freezing season. By synthesizing our data together with previous studies, we suggested that this is because the frozen soil layer was deep enough in this period to exceed the depth horizon of the plants' roots and the CH4 in free water could not enter the plants' organs.

AB Larch (Larix spp.) forests are predominantly distributed across high latitudes of Eurasia. They potentially have a strong influence on the terrestrial carbon and energy cycles, because of their vast area and the large carbon stocks in their peat soils in the permafrost. In this study, we elucidated intersite variation of ecosystem photosynthetic and respiratory parameters of eight larch forests in East Asia using the CarboEastAsia carbon flux and micrometeorology dataset. These parameters were determined using the empirical relationship between the carbon fluxes (photosynthesis and respiration) and micrometeorological variables (light and temperature). In addition, we examined leaf area index (LAI) determined by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data to explain the intersite variation. Linear or exponential relationships with annual mean temperature or seasonal maximum LAI at the study sites were found for the annual carbon fluxes (gross primary production [GPP] and total ecosystem respiration [RE]) as well as for four of the five seasonal maximum values of determined photosynthetic and respiratory parameters (maximum GPP at light saturation, initial slope of the light-response curve, daytime respiration, and RE at the reference temperature of 10 degrees C). Phenological indices, such as start day of the growing season, growing season length and growing season degree days explained much of the intersite variation of GPP and RE of the studied larch forests; however, the relationship between MODIS LAI and photosynthetic or respiratory parameters implies that the intersite variation in GPP and RE was caused not only by the temperature variation (abiotic factor), but also by the variation in the photosynthetic and respiration activity by vegetation (biotic factor) through the change in leaf (or whole vegetation) biomass. Our analysis shows that MODIS LAI serves as a good index to explain the variation of the ecosystem photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics of East Asian larch forests.

AB The effect of a spray-tank adjuvant on the persistence, distribution, and degradation of two pesticides, chlorothalonil and chlorpyrifos, was studied in a commercial cranberry bog. Pesticides were applied according to label instructions to cranberry plants in paired plot studies. Dislodgeable foliar and whole fruit residues of both pesticides and several degradation products were assessed over a growing season. Residues were also assessed in soil samples collected at fruit harvest. Adjuvant increased both fruit and foliar residues but did not significantly alter the dissipation rate or metabolism of either pesticide. The dissipation of dislodgeable foliar chlorothalonil and chlorpyrifos residues followed first-order kinetics, with estimated half-lives of 12.7 and 3.5 d, respectively. All residue levels on harvested fruit were well below the current U.S. EPA tolerances for fresh cranberries. Chlorothalonil (58%) was the major residue in fruit at harvest (76 d post-chlorothalonil application), with 4-hydroxy-2,5,6-trichloroisophthalonitrile and 1,3-dicarbamoyl-2,4,5,6-tetrachlorobenzene accounting for 26% and 6% of the total residues, respectively. Degradation products accounted for 88% of the total chlorothalonil residues in soil at fruit harvest. The products 1,3-dicarbamoyl-2,4,5,6-tetrachlorobenzene, 1-carbamoyl-3-cyano-4-hydroxy-2,5,6-trichlorobenzene, 2,5,6-trichloro-4-methylthioisophthalonitrile, and 2,4,5-trichloroisophthalonitrile have not been previously identified in cranberry bog environments. Chlorpyrifos was detected in fruit at harvest (62 d post-chlorpyrifos application), but no metabolites were found. Chlorpyrifos-oxon and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, however, were detected in earlier fruit samples and in foliage and soil samples.

AB Alpine wetlands play a sensitive function in global carbon cycle during the ongoing climate warming, yet the temporal patterns of carbon dynamics from in situ ground-based long-term observations remain unclear. Here, we analyzed the continuous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured with the eddy covariance technique over an alpine peatland on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2007 to 2016. The wetland acted as a net CO2 source with a positive NEE (120.4 +/- 34.8 gC m(-2) year(-1), Mean +/- SD), with the mean annual gross primary productivity (GPP) of 500.3 +/- 59.4 gC m(-2) year(-1) and annual ecosystem respiration (RES) of 620.7 +/- 74.2 gC m(-2) year(-1). At the seasonal scale, the classification and regression trees (CART) analysis showed that aggregated growing season degree days (GDDs) were the predominant determinant on variations in monthly NEE and monthly GPP. Variations in monthly RES were determined by soil temperature (Ts). Furthermore, nongrowing season Ts had a significant positive correlation with the following year annual GPP (p < 0.05). Nongrowing season RES only accounted for about 25% of annual RES but had significant correlation with annual RES and annual NEE (p < 0.05). The further partial correlation analysis showed that nongrowing season air temperature (Ta, p = 0.05), rather than precipitation (PPT, p = 0.25) was a predominant determinant on variations in annual NEE. Our results highlighted the importance in carbon dynamics of climate fluctuations and CO2 emission from the nongrowing season in alpine wetlands. We speculated that the vast peadlands would positively feedback to climate change on the Tibetan plateau where the nongrowing season warming was significant.

AB Samples from two coal seams of the Markushegy underground mine (Hungary) were investigated for variations in maceral composition, petrography-based facies indicators and various geochemical parameters, using three seam profiles. Both seams originate from a topogenous mire and evolved within a peneplaned coastal area covered with eutrophic swamps. The presence of foraminifera and marine algae in the marly layers is indicative of marine ingressions.
   Coal facies characterisation from these parameters is combined with the results from biomarker analyses of soluble organic matter in order to reconstruct the depositional environment and to relate petrography-based indicators to the molecular composition. The contents of macerals of the liptinite group are positively correlated with soluble organic matter (SOM) yields and Hydrogen Index (HI). Consistent with maceral composition and high HI values, enhanced proportions of n-alkanes of intermediate molecular weight (n-C21-25), which are predominantly found in macrophytes, are obtained from samples of the marly shales. The final drowning of the mire is reflected by decreasing pristane/phytane ratios, due to the rise of the (ground) water table and the establishment of anaerobic conditions. The observed positive correlation between pristane/phytane ratios and inertinite percentages suggests that, at least in the Markushegy deposit, both parameters reflect variations in redox conditions of the mire.
   The predominance of angiosperms in the peat-forming vegetation of the Markushegy coal is evidenced by the high relative proportions of angiosperm-derived triterpenoids. The influence of the relative proportion of fossil wood on tissue preservation (TPI) is indicated by the positive relationship of the concentration of land plant-derived terpenoid hydrocarbons and TPI. The degree of gelification of plant tissue (GI) is governed by the microbial activity in the mire, as indicated by a negative relationship between GI and the steroids/hopanoids concentration ratios. The variation of the delta C-13 values of coal is obviously governed by the relative contribution of plant lipids to the biomass. The obtained negative relationship between delta C-13 of the coal and GI is explained by the effect of cellulose decomposition and microbial activity on the isotopic composition of the organic matter.

AB Ecosystem services have become an important concept in policy-making. Carbon (C) sequestration into ecosystems is a significant ecosystem service, whereas C losses can be considered as an ecosystem disservice. Municipalities are in a position to make decisions that affect local emissions and therefore are important when considering greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Integrated estimations of fluxes at a regional level help local authorities to develop land use policies for minimising GHG emissions and maximising C sinks. In this study, the Finnish national GHG accounting system is modified and applied at the municipal level by combining emissions and sinks from agricultural land, forest areas, water bodies and mires (land use-related GHG emissions) with emissions from activities such as energy production and traffic (anthropogenic GHG emissions) into the LUONNIKAS calculation tool. The study area consists of 14 municipalities within the Vanajavesi catchment area located in Southern Finland. In these municipalities, croplands, peat extraction sites, water bodies and undrained mires are emission sources, whereas forests are large carbon sinks that turn the land use-related GHG budget negative, resulting in C sequestration into the ecosystem. The annual land use-related sink in the study area was 78 t CO2 eq km(-2) and 2.8 t CO2 eq per capita. Annual anthropogenic GHG emissions from the area amounted to 250 t CO2 eq km(-2) and 9.2 t CO2 eq per capita. Since forests are a significant carbon sink and the efficiency of this sink is heavily affected by forest management practices, forest management policy is a key contributing factor for mitigating municipal GHG emissions.

AB This work examined the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature and water regimes, alone and in interaction, on the leaf characteristics [leaf area (LA), specific leaf weight (SLW), leaf nitrogen content (N-L) based on LA], photosynthesis (light-saturated net carbon fixation rate, P-sat) and carbon storage in aboveground biomass of leaves (C-l) and stem (C-s) for a perennial reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L., Finnish local cultivar). For this purpose, plants were grown under different water regimes (ranging from high to low soil moisture) in climate-controlled growth chambers under the elevated CO2 and/or temperature (following a factorial design) over a whole growing season (May-September in 2009). The results showed that the elevated temperature increased the leaf growth, photosynthesis and carbon storage of aboveground biomass the most in the early growing periods, compared with ambient temperature. However, the plant growth declined rapidly thereafter with a lower carbon storage at the end of growing season. This was related to the accelerated phenology regulation and consequent earlier growth senescence. Consequently, the elevation of CO2 increased the P-sat, LA and SLW during the growing season, with a significant concurrent increase in the carbon storage in aboveground biomass. Low soil moisture decreased the P-sat, leaf stomatal conductance, LA and carbon storage in above ground biomass compared with high and normal soil moisture. This water stress effect was the largest under the elevated temperature. The elevated CO2 partially mitigated the adverse effects of high temperature and low soil moisture. However, the combination of elevated temperature and CO2 did not significantly increase the carbon storage in aboveground biomass of the plants.

AB Boreal wetlands hold vast stocks of soil carbon (C), which may be vulnerable to changes in climate. In southcentral Alaska, wetlands of the Kenai Lowlands have experienced a warming and drying trend that has led to woody vegetation encroachment into herbaceous wetlands. We examined whether predicted higher rates of gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) would be offset by higher rates of ecosystem respiration (ER) in woody wetland communities. We measured net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in four communities along a hydrologic and vegetation gradient during (1) a warm and dry growing season, (2) a more typical cool and wet growing season and (3) the intervening winter. We fit simple GEP and ER models to our data and estimated annual NEE for each community using hourly measurements of photosynthetically active radiation and air temperature. We found that woody communities exhibited greater GEP than herbaceous communities under cool and moist conditions, but more similar GEP under warm and dry conditions. Woody communities also showed greater ER than herbaceous communities during all seasons, outpacing GEP during the warm and dry growing season. On an annual basis, we estimated that herbaceous communities were either net sinks or approximately CO2 neutral, ranging from 132 center dot 8 to 4 center dot 7g CO2Cm2y1. In contrast, woody communities were sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, ranging from 78 center dot 8 to 181 center dot 7g CO2Cm2y1. Our results suggest that the initial encroachment of woody vegetation into herbaceous wetlands will lead to a substantial loss of C, particularly if conditions continue to become warmer and drier.

AB Tephra-dated palynological investigations of lowland peats which have accumulated over the last millennium, provide an excellent means of tracing recent landscape change. Pollen analytical investigations of lowland raised bogs in the northern and western counties of the province show past regional variations. At one extreme northern lowland site, the landscape has remained relatively unchanged over much of the last millennium, while in the western county agricultural expansion linked to the rise of the great estates in the 18th century is observed. These findings provide those concerned with conservation and landscape restoration with information on which to base woodland planting. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithostratigraphy, chronology and depositional environments of sixteen Holocene alluvial fill sediment cores from the southern part of the Conca of Rieti (central Italy) was established by sedimentological, palaeontological and C-14 analyses. The study area experienced a lacustrine (or palustrine) conditions and the water level was effectively controlled by a natural damming of the valley due to intermitted travertine deposition at Le Marmore site. Apart from cores S10, S13, S14 and S8 which, at their bottom, cored sediments referable to ?Upper Pliocene and Middle Pleistocene which are not the object of this paper, as a rule the drilled sediments can be referred, bottom to top, to the following four episodes: interval a, corresponding to freshwater lacustrine/palustrine environment affected by alluvial fan progradations from the edges of the valley and active by ?Middle/?Late Pleistocene to early Holocene, in this interval, several hiatuses are supposed but are not evidenced by the bad state of preservation of the sediment cores; interval b, from 361 to 371-376 m a.s,l,, recording a decrease of the water level, bracketed between the C-14 ages of 6000 and 2700 Sir B.P., which produced the formation of distinct shallow ponds/bogs, rich in aquatic vegetation; interval c, from 381 to 384 m a.s,l,, indicating a further rise of the water level, recorded by sediments containing abundant molluscs and ostracods; interval d, the upper part of the cores, records an almost continuous drying up the area as shown by abundant hydrophilic land molluscs; and interval e, the top of all sediment cores, representing the present-day soil. It has been found that the water level fluctuations occurring in the ancient Conca are chronologically consistent with the postglacial climate pattern. It is further noticed that the episodes of water highstand correspond to the Boreal-Atlantic and Subatlantic climatic ameliorations, respectively, and that the water level dropped during the global cooling episodes recurred from ca. 6000 to 2100 yr B.P. The resulting palaeoenvironmental history with that previously reported for the northern reach of the Conca of Rieti, thus suggesting a common setting for the area. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Peatlands are important sinks for atmospheric carbon (C), yet the role of plant functional types (PFTs) for C sequestration under climatic perturbations is still unclear. A plant-removal experiment was used to study the importance of vascular PFTs for the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) during (i.e., resistance) and after (i.e., recovery) an experimental drought. The removal of PFTs caused a decrease of NEE, but the rate differed between microhabitats (i.e., hummocks and lawns) and the type of PFTs. Ericoid removal had a large effect on NEE in hummocks, while the graminoids played a major role in the lawns. The removal of PFTs did not affect the resistance or the recovery after the experimental drought. We argue that the response of Sphagnum mosses (the only PFT present in all treatments) to drought is dominant over that of coexisting PFTs. However, we observed that the moment in time when the system switched from C sink to C source during the drought was controlled by the vascular PFTs. In the light of climate change, the shifts in species composition or even the loss of certain PFTs are expected to strongly affect the future C dynamics in response to environmental stress.

AB We reconstruct palaeoenvironmental conditions during the formation of the first Mid-Polish Lignite Seam (MPLS-1) of the Konin Basin of central Poland, which is of mid-Miocene age. In terms of macropetrography, the MPLS-1 comprises different lithotype associations, predominantly xylodetritic lignite, and represents the peat deposits of mires most likely inhabited by Myricaceae-Cyrillaceae shrubs. Palynological assemblages obtained from the MPLS-1 at the Adamow Lignite Opencast Mine indicate the existence of wetland/palustrine and mesophytic vegetation during the accumulation of the peat. Applying the Coexistence Approach to the palynological assemblages, climate is inferred to have been warm temperate and humid with a mean annual temperature (MAT) of 15.7-18.0 degrees C with plant communities similar to modern pocosins developed on coastal plains in southeastern USA. The palynological assemblages from the MPLS-1 at Jozwin IIB Lignite Opencast Mine show palaeofloristic cyclicality. In the studied section, five cycles were identified, dominated by swamp forests (Taxodium/Glyptostrobus-Nyssa) similar to modern forests in southeastern USA and China. The climate at that time was warm temperate and humid (MAT = 15.7-20.5 degrees C) based on CA application. This is consistent with the significant contribution of warm temperate plants, typical of mixed mesophilous forests, which grew in the vicinity of the swamp forests. The results of geochemical analyses are generally in agreement with palaeobotanical studies, indicating angiosperm dominated the peat-forming vegetation. However, the geochemically-derived average temperature ranges of ca. 24.2-25.0 degrees C, based on the carbon preference index (CPI), is significantly higher. These differences between palynologically- and geochemically-derived MATs can be explained by the influence of changes in vegetation on the CPI values. The periodic contribution of algae and microorganisms to the biomass while the water table was raised is indicated by elevated abundances of short-chain n-FAs. In contrast, under acidic conditions, bacterial activity was limited, as indicated by beta beta/(beta beta + alpha beta) hopane ratios and low sulfur content. Based on sedimentological data, the MPLS-1 was mainly formed either proximal (Jozwin IIB, Tomislawice) or more distal (Adamow) to the river channels as evidenced by the presence or absence of siliciclastic partings within the MPLS-1. In summary, the MPLS-1 accumulated mostly as low-lying mires under freshwater conditions, corresponding to the last peak of the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum and to the period thereafter when the climate showed a cooling trend. Our findings are placed in the context of palaeotectonics and palaeoclimates at regional and global scales.

AB The contents of lignin extracted by a mixture of dioxane, water, and hydrochloric acid was determined in peat-forming plants (moss, herbaceous, and woody) corresponding to types of peat, cultivated and virgin peat soils, and stubby barley residues. The balance experiments in the field and in the laboratory over 12-36 months showed that, upon the decomposition of the peat-forming plants, the part of lignin available for microorganisms was humified and mineralized, while the unavailable part accumulated in the peat. A close correlation was revealed between the lignin content in the peat-forming plants and the humic acid concentration in the peat. Upon agricultural use, the lignin content in the plow horizons of the peat soils did not change if the degree of the peat decomposition was identical to that in the virgin soils or if it was higher by 2-2.5% if the peat decomposition rate increased.

AB Ground-water seeps in the Catskill Mountains are important water sources for streams and often have different chemistry than nearby surface water. Many studies have shown correlations between water chemistry and plant species composition in wetlands, but there are no such studies in the Catskill Mountain ground-water seeps. The objective of this study was to identify the chemical and physical environmental variables that most strongly influence plant species composition in seeps. Environmental variables and plant species abundance were measured at 33 seeps. TWo-way INdicator SPecies ANalysis with analysis of variance and Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that plant species composition is determined primarily by water depth and alkalinity/acidity complex gradients. Growing season changes in water chemistry were not shown to influence the plant community.

AB Wetlands in the Western Boreal Plain (WBP) of North Central Alberta exist within a moisture-deficit regime where evapotranspiration (ET) is the dominant hydrologic flux. As such these systems are extremely susceptible to the slightest climatic variability that may upset the balance between precipitation (P) and ET. Wetland ET is predominantly controlled by vegetation composition but may also vary due to moisture regimes and microclimatic factors. To address this variability in moisture regimes, ET was examined in a typical moraine-wetland-pond system of the WBP during the 2005 and 2006 snow-free seasons. Closed dynamic chamber measurements were used to gather data on plant community-scale actual evapotranspiration (ET) in an undisturbed natural bog with varying degrees of canopy cover surrounding a shallow groundwater-fed pond. For the purposes of scaling plant community ET contributions to those of the wetland, potential ET (PETEQ) was measured using a Priestley-Taylor energy balance approach at three separate wetland sites with varying aspects surrounding the central pond, along with actual evapotranspiration using a roving eddy covariance (EC) tower. Growing season peak ET rates ranged from 0.2 mm/h to 0.6 mm/h depending on the location, vegetation composition and time period. Sphagnum contributions were the greatest early in the growing season, reaching peaks of 0.6 mm/h, while lichen sites exhibited the greatest late season rates at 0.4 mm/h. Thus, Sphagnum and other nonvascular wetland plant species control ET differently throughout the growing season and as such should be considered an integral part of the moisture and water balances within wetland environments at the sub-landscape unit scale.

AB Water depth (WD) influences wetland methane (CH4) emissions by affecting plant growth and the physical and chemical properties of soil. We studied the factors influencing CH4 emission dynamics at different WD in reclaimed reed wetland in Hangzhou Bay, China. The annual average WD was set as WD0 (0 cm), WD1 (10 cm), WD2 (20 cm), and WD3 (35 cm). The transparent chamber-gas chromatography method was used to determine CH4 fluxes during the growing season. Results showed that the average CH4 flux was 7.03 mg m(-2) h(-1), and that CH4 fluxes under all 4 WDs presented as a CH4 source. CH4 emissions of the reed wetland showed obvious seasonal changes; summer was the peak period for CH4 emissions. In a vigorous growth period of reeds, the CH4 flux gradually increased as WD increased. However, in early and late growth periods of reed, CH4 flux first increased (WD0 < WD1 < WD2) then decreased (WD2 > WD3) as WD increased. Correlation analysis showed that at the 4 WDs, CH4 flux was significantly, positively correlated with air temperature, soil temperature, and aboveground biomass of reeds, and were highly significantly positively correlated with water temperature. In addition, at WD0, CH4 flux also showed a significant, positive correlation with soil organic carbon content in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil layers, and was significantly negatively correlated with soil water content. Hence, WD significantly influenced wetland CH4 emissions. Temperature and biomass were major influencing factors of CH4 emission in reed wetland at different WDs.

AB Mass balances of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) based on stream and precipitation inputs and outflows were measured for seven unproductive lakes in central Ontario between 1981 and 1989. Net annual CO2 evasion occurred in six of the seven study lakes with minor net invasion in the seventh. Atmospheric invasion might have been significant at certain times of the year, particularly during the growing season. Net evasion rates were greater than DIC loading rates, indicating partial mineralization of the terrestrially-derive DOC in the lakes. A steady state mass balance model adequately described the variation in DOC retention between lakes. Net annual carbon accumulation of forest communities based on estimates of net ecosystem production may be overestimated because of significant export of carbon to lakes via streams and groundwater, particularly in catchments with extensive peatlands.

AB In this study, we describe the seasonal variation in (15)N abundance in the litter of two Sphagnum species and four vascular plant species during 3 years of field decomposition in an Italian Alpine bog. Litter bags were periodically retrieved at the end of summer and winter periods, and the delta(15)N in residual litter was related to mass loss, litter chemistry, and climatic conditions. In Sphagnum litter, higher rates of decomposition during summer months were associated with an increase of delta(15)N probably due to the incorporation of microbial organic compounds rich in (15)N. The litter of Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex rostrata was characterized by a decrease of delta(15)N, so that the final signature was significantly lower than in initial litter. On the other hand, the residual litter of Potentilla erecta and Calluna vulgaris was characterized by a final delta(15)N higher than in initial litter. Our data reported a seasonality of (15)N abundance in the residual litter of Sphagnum species, but not in that of vascular plant species, thus highlighting the role of differences in litter chemistry.

AB Tundra ecosystems store vast amounts of soil organic carbon, which may be sensitive to climatic change. Net ecosystem production, NEP, is the net exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between landscapes and the atmosphere, and represents the balance between CO2 uptake by photosynthesis and release by decomposition and autotrophic respiration. Here we examine CO2 exchange across seven sites in the Canadian low and high Arctic during the peak growing season (July) in summer 2008. All sites were net sinks for atmospheric CO2 (NEP ranged from 5 to 67 g C m(-2)), with low Arctic sites being substantially larger CO2 sinks. The spatial difference in NEP between low and high Arctic sites was determined more by CO2 uptake via gross ecosystem production than by CO2 release via ecosystem respiration. Maximum gross ecosystem production at the low Arctic sites (average 8.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was about 4 times larger than for high Arctic sites (average 2.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). NEP decreased with increasing temperature at all low Arctic sites, driven largely by the ecosystem respiration response. No consistent temperature response was found for the high Arctic sites. The results of this study clearly indicate there are large differences in tundra CO2 exchange between high and low Arctic environments and this difference should be a central consideration in studies of Arctic carbon balance and climate change.

AB Detailed study of a peat plateau near the southern boundary of the East European permafrost zone has been performed. The botanical and palynological compositions of the peat to the depth of 10 m, its radiocarbon dates (the AMS method), and its physical and chemical characteristics have been determined. The accumulation of peat in this area began about 8300 years ago at the end of the Boreal period. In the middle of the Atlantic period, the rate of peat accumulation reached 1.44 mm/yr. During the warming phase in the Middle Subboreal period, the peat plateau was subjected to active thermal erosion; part of the peat was eroded. The processes of thermal erosion are also active at present and destroy the edges of peat mounds. At the same time, the gradual accumulation of peat on the plateau continues. An increase in the degree of peat mineralization is expected upon the establishment of aerobic conditions against the background degradation of the permafrost. Peat plateaus and large peat mounds have been the sinks of atmospheric carbon for a larger part of their history. In this context, we do not expect their significant negative influence on the climate in the future.

AB Soil erosion exacerbates the reduction of soil organic matter (SOM) and destruction of soil physical structure in agricultural systems, which seriously threatens agricultural ecological environment and global sustainable agriculture development. Owing to rich SOM and nutrients of woody peat results in it's widely applied in degraded soil for improving land productivity. But how the impacted of woody peat addition on crop growth and soil organic matter (SOM) in different textured degenerated erodible soils are not well understood. Here, along the latitudinal gradient from north to south of China, four typical regional soils collected in Northeast (black soil), Northwest (loessial soil), Central (lou soil) and South (red soil) of China, where suffered strongly soil erosion. Soil clay content was 37.0%, 16.9%, 29.6%, and 38.5% for the black, loessial, lou, and red soils, respectively. We conducted a plot incubation experiment in a fully ventilated, rainproof outdoor greenhouse for planting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The study is aimed to investigate the response of different texture eroded soil to crop growth and physiology, soil evaporation and soil organic matter after woody peat addition. Eight treatments have been designed for four soils with two groups. (i) the control group with no woody peat addition, B0, H0, L0 and R0; (ii) woody peat addition group, BW, HW, LW and RW. Overall, the SOM concentration altered wheat growth characteristic and grain yield in the four typical erosion degraded soils. The highest grain yield of winter wheat is 6.5 +/- 1.3 g per plot in B0 and 6.5 +/- 1.1 g per plot in BW, and the lowest is 0.4 +/- 0.1 g per plot in R0 in red soil. But woody peat addition increased the wheat yield or yield variation, the wheat gain yield increased four times with woody peat addition (RW) than control (R0) in red soil. In addition, the results revealed that the SOM content were increased in black soil by 40.4%, in loessial soil by 40.0%, in lou soil by 101.3%, and in red soil by 94.6% when compared to the control treatments at harvest. From sowing to harvest, SOM decreased by 5.1 +/- 1.8 g kg-1 (black soil), 9.9 +/- 0.9 g kg-1 (loessial soil), 7.6 +/- 1.8 g kg-1 (lou soil), and 6.2 +/- 1.0 g kg-1 (red soil) in the soils with woody peat addition. Without woody peat addition, SOM decreased by 5.6 g kg-1 (black soil), 4.7 g kg-1 (lou soil), and 0.6 g kg-1 (red soil), but increased by 0.4 g kg-1 in loessial soil. In conclusion, woody peat addition resulted in wheat yield increasing in the degenerated soils, but it's significant in the red soil with adequate nutrient supply and increased soil acid buffering capacity. Woody peat addition increased the SOM concentration in the four degenerated soils, but a faster decreasing rate of the Delta SOM in coarse-textured loessial soil than others medium-fine texture soils. Therefore, appropriate woody peat application and clay content is more conducive to the protection of SOM. More deeply research should have been focused on the impact of woody peat addition in coarse-textured soil on the soil environment (such as the clay type, content, and soil priming effect, etc.).

TI Subsurface drainage from hummock-covered hillslopes in the Arctic tundra
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE subsurface runoff; peat; arctic tundra; permafrost; modelling
ID PERMAFROST
AB In the Arctic tundra, subsurface drainage occurs predominantly through the saturated zone within the layer of peat that mantles the hillslopes. In plan view, the peat cover is fragmented into a network of channels due to the presence of mineral earth hummocks. In cross section, the physical and hydraulic properties of the peat vary with depth and the water transmission characteristics (e.g. hydraulic conductivity) of the upper profile differ distinctly from those of the lower. Water flow through the peat is laminar, therefore the friction factor (f) and the Reynolds number (N-R) are inversely related. Average values for the coefficient C of the relation f = C/N-R, vary from similar to 300 near the surface to similar to 14,500 at depth. This large difference in C confirms that the larger-diameter soil pores of the living vegetation and lightly decomposed peat near the surface offer much less resistance to water motion than the finer-grained peat deeper in the profile. Also, the variability suggests that subsurface drainage is strongly affected by the position and thickness of the saturated zone within the peat matrix. A first approximation for a model or simulation of the how regime may consider a peat profile with depth-varying, resistance properties in respect to subsurface flow. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Arctic tundra is a globally important store for carbon (C). However, there is a lack of reference sites characterising C exchange dynamics across annual cycles. Based on the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM) programme, here we present 9-11 years of flux and ecosystem data across the period 2008-2018 from two wetland sites in Greenland: Zackenberg (74 degrees N) and Kobbefjord (64 degrees N). The Zackenberg fen was a strong C sink despite its higher latitude and shorter growing seasons compared to the Kobbefjord fen. On average the ecosystem in Zackenberg took up similar to-50 g C m(-2)yr(-1)(range of +21 to -90 g C m(-2)yr(-1)), more than twice that of Kobbefjord (mean similar to-18 g C m(-2)yr(-1), and range of +41 to - 41 g C m(-2)yr(-1)). The larger net carbon sequestration in Zackenberg fen was associated with higher leaf nitrogen (71%), leaf area index (140%), and plant quality (i.e. C:N ratio; 36%). Additional evidence fromin-situmeasurements includes 3 times higher levels of dissolved organic carbon in soils and 5 times more available plant nutrients, including dissolved organic nitrogen (N) and nitrates, in Zackenberg. Simulations using the soil-plant-atmosphere ecosystem model showed that Zackenberg's stronger CO(2)sink could be related to measured differences in plant nutrients, and their effects on photosynthesis and respiration. The model explained 69% of the variability of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, 80% for photosynthesis and 71% for respiration over 11 years at Zackenberg, similar to previous results at Kobbefjord (73%, 73%, and 50%, respectively, over 8 years). We conclude that growing season limitations of plant phenology on net C uptake have been more than counterbalanced by the increased leaf nutrient content at the Zackenberg site.

AB Soil contamination with copper is a global issue, in particular in soils with a history of fertilizers, fungicides or municipal waste amendment. Several remediation techniques have been investigated to reduce the environmental impact of Cu-contaminated soil, including the use of organic amendments such as composts and biochars, which can bound part of the soluble fraction of the metal. The objective of this work is to study the effect of biochar and biochar plus compost addition on copper mobility, soil microbial biomass and growth of different plant species following remediation of a soil spiked with copper (1000 mg Cu kg(-1)). The contaminated soil was treated with 10 wt% of biochar or biochar plus compost. Different plant species (mustard, cress and ryegrass) were grown in the soil during 4 weeks. A significant reduction on the mobile form of Cu was observed in soils treated with biochar and biochar plus compost. The highest microbial biomass values were obtained in samples treated with biochar plus compost. After cress growth, the microbial biomass of soil treated with biochar plus compost was similar to that of non-polluted soil. The germination test showed increased root length in the amended soils compared to the contaminated soils. With respect to biomass growth of vegetable species in copper polluted soil, only ryegrass presented a satisfactory growth in the contaminated soil without the biochar treatment. For mustard and cress, biomass growth was only observed following biochar addition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The methane produced in pear soils can vary over the growing season due to variations in the supply of available substrate, the activity of the microbial community or changes in temperature. Our aim was to study how these factors regulate the methane production over the season from five different peat types of different botanical origin. Feat samples were collected on seven occasions between June and September. After each sampling, the peat soils were incubated at five different temperatures (7, 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C) without added substrate, or at 20 degrees C with added substrate (glucose, or H-2/CO2, or starch). Rates of methane production averaged over the season differed significantly (P < 0.05, R-2 = 0.76) among the five peat types, the minerotrophic lawn producing the highest rates, and the hummock peat producing the lowest. The seasonal average Q(10) values for each plant community varied between 4.6 and 9.2, the highest value being associated with the ombrotrophic lawn and the lowest value with the mud-bottom plant community. For the unamended pear samples, the rates of methane production from each plant community varied significantly (P < 0.05) over the season. This implies that the quality of organic matter, in combination with changes in temperature, explains the seasonal variation in methane production. However, addition of saturating amounts of glucose, H-2/CO2 or starch at 20 degrees C significantly reduced the seasonal variation (P < 0.05) in methane production in peat from the minerotrophic lawn, wet carpet and mud-bottom plant communities. This suggests that substrate supply (e.g. root exudates) for the micro-organisms also varied over the season at these sites. Seasonal variation in methane production rates was apparent in pear from the hummock and ombrotrophic lawn plant communities even after addition of substrates, suggesting that the active biomass of the anaerobic microbial populations at these sites was regulated by other factors than the ones studied.

AB Permafrost covers 25% of the land surface in the northern hemisphere, where mean annual ground temperature is less than 0degreesC. A 1.4-5.8 degreesC warming by 2100 will likely change the sign of mean annual air and ground temperatures over much of the zones of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost in the northern hemisphere, causing widespread permafrost thaw. In this study, I examined rates of discontinuous permafrost thaw in the boreal peatlands of northern Manitoba, Canada, using a combination of tree-ring analyses to document thaw rates from 1941-1991 and direct measurements of permanent benchmarks established in 1995 and resurveyed in 2002. I used instrumented records of mean annual and seasonal air temperatures, mean winter snow depth, and duration of continuous snow pack from climate stations across northern Manitoba to analyze temporal and spatial trends in these variables and their potential impacts on thaw. Permafrost thaw in central Canadian peatlands has accelerated significantly since 1950, concurrent with a significant, late-20th-century average climate warming of +1.32 degreesC in this region. There were strong seasonal differences in warming in northern Manitoba, with highest rates of warming during winter (+1.39 degreesC to +1.66 degreesC) and spring (+0.56 degreesC to +0.78 degreesC) at southern climate stations where permafrost thaw was most rapid. Projecting current warming trends to year 2100, I show that trends for north-central Canada are in good agreement with general circulation models, which suggest a 4-8 degreesC warming at high latitudes. This magnitude of warming will begin to eliminate most of the present range of sporadic and discontinuous permafrost in central Canada by 2100.

AB Wetlands cover more than 6% of the global ice-free land area, and have been recognized as important sinks for arsenic. Wetland soils and sediments are subject to frequent changes in redox conditions, driven by fluctuations in the water table and shifts in biological activity. Under oxic conditions, natural organic matter promotes arsenic release from metal-(hydr)oxides, thereby enhancing arsenic mobility. Under strongly reducing conditions, however, organic matter triggers the formation of arsenic-sequestering sulphides, leading to a reduction in arsenic mobility. Furthermore, the sorption of arsenic to natural organic matter is increasingly thought to suppress arsenic mobility, but the binding mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we use X-ray absorption spectroscopy to analyse the speciation of solid-phase arsenic in peat samples collected from a naturally arsenic-enriched peatland in Switzerland. We show that natural organic matter can completely sequester arsenic through the formation of covalent bonds between trivalent arsenic and organic sulphur groups, which have an average arsenic-sulphur bond distance of 2.26 angstrom. We suggest that by binding arsenic in this way, natural organic matter plays an active role in arsenic immobilization in sulphur-enriched, anoxic wetlands.

AB A novel occurrence of an Eemian interglacial peat was identified in 2011 in a short-lived outcrop of the NEL-pipeline trench, near the village of Banzin, Germany. The profiles are situated in a shallow kettle hole within the undulated landscape of the Saalian glaciation. The distribution of dominantly till lithofacies in the Banzin area confirms the regional trend of Saalian tills with a locally higher abundance of Cretaceous clasts. In the Banzin kettle, at a depth of 2.2 m, lies a 0.5-m thick, strongly compressed Eemian peat layer. The buried Eemian peat layer is deformed by ice-wedge pseudo-morphological and mega crack structures, indicating a strong periglacial influence during Weichselian stadial phases. The postEemian sequence is subdivided into three units, beginning with a mixture of aeolian and gelifluction deposits, which are also modified by cryostructures. The top of the Banzin sequence is covered by a 0.5-m thick colluvisol layer of redeposited humic loam from the Late Weichselian/Holocene. The uppermost unit suggests that solifluction processes occurred in the last few hundred years, likely driven by intensive anthropogenic influence.
   Limnic sedimentation began during the Late Saalian period in a landscape characterized by herbaceous vegetation and heliophytes. During the latest interval of Saalian deglaciation, shallow waters of the basin most likely attained a depth below 3 m and were abundant in calcium carbonate. The beginning of Eemian interglacial peat accumulation (MIS 5e) is characterized by a dominance of light birch forests followed by pine. The ensuing optimum climate was dominated by the encroachment of oak forests and then hazel-oak forest, and sedimentation ceased in the basin during this phase. At the climatic optimum (PZ III/IV), the Eemian peat included remains of Ceratophyllum submersum and species of higher temperature requirements. The Banzin basin gradually became shallower and overgrown until the closing of its open water at the end of phase III/IVa. The lack of Cladocera species composition in the Eemian sequence proves isolated conditions of a shallow reservoir. We present the first results from NE-Germany for Eemian peat bog samples dated by the U-Th disequilibrium method (Th-230/U), using leachate alone (L/L) and total sample dissolution (TSD) analytical techniques. Isochron-corrected Th-230/U ages of 118 +/- 8/10 ka (L/L) and 121 +/- 9/13 ka (TSD) were obtained. Both Th-230/U dates similar to 118-121 ka, obtained using two different techniques, confirm the biostratigraphical classification into the Eemian interglacial. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB Wetlands, including peatlands, supply crucial ecosystem services such as water purification, carbon sequestration and regulation of hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. Peatlands are especially important as carbon sinks and stores because of the incomplete decomposition of vegetation within the peat. Good knowledge of individual wetlands exists locally, but information on how different wetland systems interact with their surroundings is lacking. In this study, the ability to use a depression-based digital elevation model (DEM) method to inventory wetlands in northern landscapes and assess their hydrological connectivity was investigated. The method consisted of three steps: (1) identification and mapping of wetlands, (2) identification of threshold values of minimum wetland size and depth, and (3) delineation of a defined coherent area of multiple wetlands with hydrological connectivity, called wetlandscape. The results showed that 64% of identified wetlands corresponded with an existing wetland map in the study area, but only 10% of the wetlands in the existing map were identified, with the F1 score being 17%. Therefore, the methodology cannot independently map wetlands and future research should be conducted in which additional data sources and mapping techniques are integrated. However, wetland connectivity could be mapped with the depression-based DEM methodology by utilising information on upstream and downstream wetland depressions, catchment boundaries and drainage flow paths. Knowledge about wetland connectivity is crucial for understanding how physical, biological and chemical materials are transported and distributed in the landscape, and thus also for resilience, management and protection of wetlandscapes.

AB Catchment storage sustains ecologically important low flows in headwater systems. Understanding the factors controlling storage is essential in analysis of catchment vulnerability to global change. We calculated catchment storage and storage sensitivity of streamflow for 61 boreal headwater catchments in Finland. We also explored the connection between computed storage indices and low flow conditions. The relationships between selected climate, snow, and catchment characteristics and calculated storage properties and low flows were investigated, in order to assess the importance of different factors that render catchments vulnerable to climate and environmental change. We found that the most sensitive areas to climate change were located in the southern boreal coastal zone, with fine-grained soils and agricultural areas. In contrast, catchments in the middle and northern boreal zone, with till and peatland soils and higher snow water equivalent values, were less sensitive under current conditions. In addition, we found a threshold at a snow to precipitation ratio of 0.35. Above that threshold, summer low flows were generally sensitive to changes in snow conditions, whereas below that threshold catchment characteristics gained importance and the sensitivity was more directly related to changes in temperature and timing of rainfall. These findings suggest that a warming climate will have pronounced impacts on hydrology and catchment sensitivity related to snow quantity and snow cover duration in certain snow to precipitation ratio zones. Moreover, land use activities had an impact on storage properties in agricultural and drained peatland areas, resulting in a negative effect on low flows.

AB The closed chamber technique has been widely employed to detect methane emissions, despite little being known about whether the absence or presence of light will impact the flux estimation. Here, we employed a laser greenhouse gas analyzer with an opaque-transparent chamber pair to measure the methane emission rate in a boreal peatland complex. Microtopography (i.e., hummocks and hollows) in natural and drained peatlands, and plant communities (i.e., grasses and shrubs) in a pasture converted from natural peatlands, were considered to cover the local heterogeneity. Our results indicated that opaque chambers (0.58-0.78 g CH4 m(-2) during the growing season) measured a significantly higher (similar to 2-3 times) methane emission at the hummocks than transparent chambers (similar to 0.24 g CH4 m(-2)); however, a similar phenomenon was not found at the hollows or at other measurement plots. Gross photosynthesis explained 44%-47% of the temporal variation of the 'artificial bias' (the difference in methane flux obtained by the opaque versus transparent chambers) at the hummocks. Additionally, both water table depth and surface soil moisture significantly explained spatial variations of methane emissions. Our study suggests that microtopography has a significant influence on the artificial bias in methane emission estimation and the artificial properties of a chamber (transparency/opacity) method can be vitally important in some cases (i.e., hummocks), and negligible in others (i.e., hollows). The observed connection between the photosynthesis process and the 'artificial bias' of closed chambers (opaque versus transparent) can be used to improve methane flux modeling. Separate parameterization schemes are needed for methane transportation under the presence or absence of light.

AB This paper presents a review of the advances in the variable penetration rate testing methods on inorganic soils and its potentials to investigate the appropriate penetration rate and resistance factors for penetrometer testing of peat. A partially drained condition, which often leads to misinterpretation of test results, has been observed in peat penetration testing when the standard rate of 20 mm/s is used. Although the impact of rate-effects on penetration resistance measured with CPTu, T-bar and ball penetrometer have been investigated extensively in various intermediate soils, research is limited on how penetration rate controls drainage conditions and affects consolidation behaviour in peat. This review synthesises research developments in using variable penetration rate tests. The objective is to evaluate the transition of drainage conditions and consolidation behaviour of inorganic soils while focusing on its adaptability for peat. The review provides guidance on the investigation of the penetration rate testing in peat.

AB A reciprocal experiment was analyzed to determine whether 30 open-pollinated families of peatland and upland populations of black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] sampled from a single area in north-central Alberta, Canada, performed consistently when grown in either flooded or well-drained soils (i.e., if there is a family x soil interaction or generally called genotype x environment interaction (GEI)). The data for the analysis consisted of five traits (height, root dry weight, shoot dry weight, root/shoot dry weight ratio and number of braches) describing growth and rooting performance of tree seedlings in flooded and drained soils (root environments) in a greenhouse for 16 weeks. A mixed-model analysis was used to characterize GEL The analysis revealed an interesting contrast of GEI patterns between the peatland vs. upland populations: GEI was absent (as indicated by a perfect correlation between flooded and drained soils) in peatland population but present in the upland population. Our results from the characterization of GEI are also consistent with the well-known theory about selection in different environments that correlated responses due to indirect selection are in general less than direct responses. The contrasting patterns of GEI in peatland vs. upland populations may be reflective of different strategies of adaptation to the contrasting environmental conditions, with the peatland trees growing slowly but steadily and with the upland populations growing fast and very responsive to environmental changes.

TI Peat-based emissions in Finland's national greenhouse gas inventory
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Peat-based emissions are reported under three different reporting sectors in Finland's national greenhouse gas inventory: Agriculture, Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and Energy. Peat-based emissions comprise together around one third of the total reported net greenhouse gas emissions in Finland when also sinks and emissions from LULUCF sector are included. Most of the emissions come from the combustion of peat for energy but emissions from the agricultural use of peatlands and drained forest soils are also of importance. The IPCC (Intergovemmental Panel on Climate Change) provides the basic guidelines for the inventory calculations. However, the use of national methods and emission factors is encouraged. Introducing new country-specific methods or emission factors in the inventory calculations requires transparent documentation of the input parameters and the process how emission factors, parameters and models are derived. Here we describe the national system for estimating peat-based emissions for the greenhouse gas inventory, and the methods that are used in deriving the emission estimates, as well as possibilities to use new national emission factors for improving the estimates.

AB Assessing whether land use, from activities such as wind farm construction and tree-felling, impacts on terrestrial C delivery to rivers has focused on quantifying the loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and not the composition changes. Here we explore how land use influences DOC composition by considering fluvial DOC concentration, [DOC], and spectrophotometric composition of a river draining a peat-rich catchment. We find that in this 5.7 km(2) catchment differences occur in both the concentration and composition of the DOC in its sub-catchments. This is attributed to differences in how land was used: one tributary (D-WF) drains an area with wind farm construction and forestry in the headwaters, and one tributary (D-FF) drains an area with felled plantation trees. Generally, [DOC] in both streams showed similar seasonal variation, and autumn maxima. However, the felled catchment had greater mean [DOC] than the wind farm catchment. The SUVA254 and E4/E6 indicated DOC in both streams had similar aromaticity and fulvic: humic acid for most of the time, but SUVA410 and E2/E4 indicated less DOC humification in the felled catchment. This may be due to young DOC from the breakdown of residual branches and roots, or more humification in soils in the wind farm area. During the dry months, DOC composition showed more spatial variation: the D-WF DOC had smaller SUVA254 (less total aromatic material) and SUVA410 (fewer humic substances). The decreased E2/E4 in both streams indicated the total aromatic carbon decreased more than humic substances content. Moreover, the larger E4/E6 for D-WF in summer indicated that the humic substances were richer in fulvic acids than humic acids. Soil disturbance associated with forestry-felling likely contributed to the higher [DOC] and release of less-humified material in D-FF. This research indicates drivers of different DOC concentration and composition can exist even in small catchments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation patterns of subalpine gully-head mires were investigated in the flat-topped Lammerlaw and Lammermoor Ranges, South Island, New Zealand. Two intensively studied mires each consist of a series of peaty terraces and scarps. Terraces may contain pools, elongated downslope in the narrow, lower altitude mire, but across slope in the broader, upper mire. A crest occurs on some terrace lips, and marginal "spillways" (channel-like zones) occur down some scarps. Some mires have drained by subsurface pipes.
   Vegetation analysis distinguished between grassland or herbfield on gully sides, vegetation of mire margins, showing aspect differences on the steeper, lower mire, and the vegetation of gully floors, including oligotrophic mire centre vegetation and species-poor pools. The crests, though warmer, bore no special vegetation type.
   Mineral soil beneath the peat indicates a previous non-mire vegetation, which has subsequently paludified. Scarp slumps indicate downslope creep of organic material. Peat fissures, and mineral, vegetation, and erosion dams all appear to have initiated development of some pools.
   Mires are designated gully-head ribbon fens. Patterning appears to be accentuated because of the mires' gully-head location on broad-topped ranges, and drainage of soligenous water from upslope gully sides. These apparently unique fens give insight into patterning in aapa mires, and merit special conservation.

ID FIRING RANGES; EAR; INDOOR
AB Transmission losses (TL) to highly impulsive signals generated by three firearms have been measured for two ear muffs, using both a head and torso simulator and a miniature microphone located at the ear canal entrance (MIRE technique). Peak SPL TL have been found to be well approximated by 40 ms short-L eq TL. This has allowed the use of transmissibilities and correction factors for bone conduction and physiological masking appropriate for continuous noise, for the calculation of REAT-type peak insertion losses (IL). Results indicate that peak IL can be well predicted by estimates based on one-third octave band 40 ms short L eq and manufacturer-declared (nominal) IL measured for continuous noise according to test standards. Such predictions tend to be more accurate at the high end of the range, while they are less reliable when the attenuation is lower. A user-friendly simplified prediction algorithm has also been developed, which only requires nominal IL and one-third octave sound exposure level spectra. Separate predictions are possible for IL in direct and diffuse sound fields, albeit with higher uncertainties, due to the smaller number of experimental data comprising the two separate datasets on which such predictions are based.

AB Drainage can help restore hydrological conditions conducive to the growth of black spruce (Picea marlana) seedlings on logged forested peatlands. The impact of drainage was assessed by analysing the variation in stand density at stump height, black spruce seedling annual diameter growth and composition of plant communities on 20 of the oldest operationally drained sites in Quebec's James Bay region. These sites, each consisting of a drained, post-harvest area and a corresponding undrained, post-harvest control area, were classified into five ecosites based on soil characteristics and plant communities. The ecosites studied varied from those with rich mineral soils covered with a shallow organic layer to very poor, deep, organic soils. Results showed that the growth response of black spruce seedlings following drainage was strongly dependent on the ecosite. Ecosites RE37 and rich RE39 showed a substantial and steady growth response of black spruce to drainage over time. Therefore, drainage caused a significant increase in stand density and growth rate of black spruce seedlings in moderately rich ecosites. In the other ecosites studied, the peat layer was either too thick (poor RE39 and very poor RE39) or too shallow (RE26) for black spruce stand densities and individual stems growth to increase with drainage, compared to those of the control areas.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions were compared for an intensively and extensively managed agricultural area on peat soils in the Netherlands to evaluate the effect of reduced management on the CH4 balance. Chamber measurements (photoacoustic methods) for CH4 were performed for a period of three years in the contributing landscape elements in the research sites. Various factors influencing CH4 emissions were evaluated and temperature of water and soil was found to be the main driver in both sites. For upscaling of CH4 fluxes to landscape scale, regression models were used which were specific for each of the contributing landforms. Ditches and bordering edges were emission hotspots and emitted together between 60% and 70% of the total terrestrial CH4 emissions. Annual terrestrial CH4 fluxes were estimated to be 203 (+/- 48%), 162 (+/- 60%) and 146 (+/- 60%) kg CH4 ha(-1) and 157 (+/- 63%), 180 (+/- 54%) and 163 (+/- 59%) kg CH4 ha(-1) in the intensively managed site and extensively managed site, for 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively. About 70% of the CH4 was emitted in the summer period. Farm based emissions caused per year an additional 257 kg CH4 ha(-1) and 172 kg CH4 ha(-1) for the intensively managed site and extensively managed site, respectively. To further evaluate the effect of agricultural activity on the CH4 balance, the annual CH4 fluxes of the two managed sites were also compared to the emissions of a natural peat site with no management and high ground water levels. By comparing the terrestrial and additional farm based emissions of the three sites, we finally concluded that transformation of intensively managed agricultural land to nature development will lead to an increase in terrestrial CH4 emission, but will not by definition lead to a significant increase in CH4 emission when farm based emissions are included.

AB The effect of moorland management on the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from blanket peat is currently a topic of great interest in the UK. A recent paper by Chapman et al. (Biogeochemistry, doi:10.1007/s10533-010-9474-x, 2010) reports on changes in humic colour/DOC concentrations in surface waters draining 15 upland peat catchments in the North Pennines (UK) over two decades, and examines the possible underlying drivers of those changes. Chapman et al. identify significant variation in water colour between adjacent catchments and over time. One potential driver of changes in DOC is managed moorland burning, and Chapman et al. state that their study provides evidence that burning has no effect on colour in upland catchment drainage waters. This observation counters a recent series of papers showing strong links between new moorland burn management on blanket peat soils and colour/DOC in catchment drainage waters. We have reviewed the methodological approach and results presented by Chapman et al. that relate to the assessment of managed burning, and show significant errors in the data used in their analysis. This has resulted in conclusions being drawn about the role of managed burning in DOC release that are not supported by evidence.

AB Marginal organic soils, abundant in the boreal region, are being increasingly used for bioenergy crop cultivation. Using long-term field experimental data on greenhouse gas (GHG) balance from a perennial bioenergy crop [reed canary grass (RCG), Phalaris arundinaceae L.] cultivated on a drained organic soil as an example, we show here for the first time that, with a proper cultivation and land-use practice, environmentally sound bioenergy production is possible on these problematic soil types. We performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) for RCG on this organic soil. We found that, on an average, this system produces 40% less CO2-equivalents per MWh of energy in comparison with a conventional energy source such as coal. Climatic conditions regulating the RCG carbon exchange processes have a high impact on the benefits from this bioenergy production system. Under appropriate hydrological conditions, this system can even be carbon-negative. An LCA sensitivity analysis revealed that net ecosystem CO2 exchange and crop yield are the major LCA components, while non-CO2 GHG emissions and costs associated with crop production are the minor ones. Net bioenergy GHG emissions resulting from restricted net CO2 uptake and low crop yields, due to climatic and moisture stress during dry years, were comparable with coal emissions. However, net bioenergy emissions during wet years with high net uptake and crop yield were only a third of the coal emissions. As long-term experimental data on GHG balance of bioenergy production are scarce, scientific data stemming from field experiments are needed in shaping renewable energy source policies.

AB The carbon budget dynamics of peatlands plays a crucial role in both the response of peatland ecosystems to environmental change and the effect of environmental change on peatlands. Studies on northern peatlands have suggested that the reliable assessment of the carbon budget must include the carbon flux at the land-stream interface. But this argument has not been proved in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the world's largest alpine system. To address the knowledge gap, in the growing season (May to October) of 2016, we chose Riganqiao peatland, a typical peatland in the Zoige Basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau which has been intensely drained via ditches since the 1960s. The objective of this study was to measure the organic carbon export from ditches, and to estimate what proportion of the carbon budget can be attributed to this export. Results showed that, during the growing season in 2016, total organic carbon flux in ditches was 2,345 t (8.6 g m(-2)), of which particulate organic carbon accounted for 12% and dissolved organic carbon for 88%. This flux decreased the carbon budget of Riganqiao peatland by 11.2% (from +76.8 g m(-2) to +68.2 g m(-2)), making it a weakened carbon sink. This result revealed that organic carbon export from ditches plays an important role in the carbon balance in peatland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB We investigated relationships between phosphorus (P) availability and fractionation and growth of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) in the Athabasca oil sands region. The study sites had peat -mineral soil mix (PMM) as cover soil over a tailings sand substrate planted to pine or an overburden substrate planted to spruce. Available P was determined using a modified Kelowna extraction and sequentially extracted to obtain exchangeable, Fe-and Al-bound, Ca-and Mg-bound, organic, and residual P. The organic P content in PMM explained 83% and 65% of the variations in available P in the pine and spruce sites, respectively. Phosphorus bound to Fe and Al in PMM was also positively related to available P on pine sites (p < 0.001) but not on spruce sites. Available P in PMM was correlated with aboveground biomass increment of spruce (p < 0.05) and explained 78% of the variation in foliar P. Foliar P in both pine and spruce was lower than the adequate level for tree growth. Low foliar P and available P in PMM affect the successful establishment of pine and spruce trees on the reclaimed sites, and proper P nutrition management is important to overcome P limitation in reclaimed soils.

AB We studied concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the eutrophic Temmesjoki River and Estuary in the Liminganlahti Bay in 2003-2004 and evaluated the atmospheric fluxes of the gases based on measured concentrations, wind speeds and water current velocities. The Temmesjoki River was a source of CO2, CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere, whereas the Liminganlahti Bay was a minor source of CH4 and a minor source or a sink of CO2 and N2O. The results show that the fluxes of greenhouse gases in river ecosystems are highly related to the land use in its catchment areas. The most upstream river site, surrounded by forests and drained peatlands, released significant amounts of CO2 and CH4, with average fluxes of 5,400 mg CO2-C m(-2) d(-1) and 66 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1), and concentrations of 210 mu M and 345 nM, respectively, but N2O concentrations, at an average of 17 nM, were close to the atmospheric equilibrium concentration. The downstream river sites surrounded by agricultural soils released significant amounts of N2O (with an average emission of 650 mu g N2O-N m(-2) d(-1) and concentration of 22 nM), whereas the CO2 and CH4 concentrations were low compared to the upstream site (55 mu M and 350 nM). In boreal regions, rivers are partly ice-covered in wintertime (approximately 5 months). A large part of the gases, i.e. 58% of CO2, 55% of CH4 and 36% of N2O emissions, were found to be released during wintertime from unfrozen parts of the river.

AB Denitrification is well known being the most important nitrate-consuming process in water-logged peat soils, whereby the intermediate compound nitrous oxide (N2O) and the end product dinitrogen (N-2) are ultimately released. The present study was aimed at evaluating the release of these gases (due to denitrification) from a nutrient-poor transition bog ecosystem under drained and three differently rewetted conditions at the field scale using a N-15-tracer approach ([N-15]nitrate application, 30 kg N ha(-1)) and a common closed-chamber technique. The drained site is characterized by a constant water table (WT) of -30 cm (here referred to as D30), while rewetted sites represent a constant WT of -15 cm, a constant WT of 0 cm (i.e. waterlogged), and an initial WT of 0 cm (which decreased slightly during the experiment), respectively, (here referred to as R15, R0, and R0(d), respectively). The highest N2O emissions were observed at D30 (291 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)) as well as at R0(d) (665 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)). At the rewetted peat sites with a constant WT (i.e. R15 and R0), considerably lower N2O emissions were observed (maximal 37 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)). Concerning N-2 only at the initially water-logged peat site R0(d) considerable release rates (up to 3110 mu g N-2-N m(-2) h(-1)) were observed, while under drained conditions (D30) no N-2 emission and under rewetted conditions with a constant WT (R15 and R0) significantly lower N-2 release rates (maximal 668 mu g N-2-N m(-2) h(-1)) could be detected. In addition, it has been found that natural WT fluctuations at rewetted peat sites, in particular a rapid drop down of the WT, can induce high emission rates for both N2O and N-2.

AB To evaluate the coexistence of agricultural managements and wetland ecosystem conservation, the Bibai mire, an ombrotrophic mire in Hokkaido, Japan, was selected as an experimental site that had been affected by neighboring agricultural managements. Since the lowering of the level of the groundwater table in the peripheral area of the mire had threatened indigenous vegetations, keeping the groundwater table shallow by trench irrigation seemed to be an effective measure to recover the original vegetation. The objective of the present study was to quantify the amount of water and the effective area of trench irrigation required in a bamboo-invading area in a pristine mire. We constructed a trench 28 m long and irrigated at the rate of 2.22 m(3) d(-1) in a bamboo-invading area in the mire. And to analyze the hydro-meteorological conditions under the trench irrigation, we measured the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the peat layer (3.8 X 10(-3) cm S-1), the evapotranspiration rate (2.80 mm d(-1)), the depth of the non-irrigated groundwater table (0.15 m) and the surface gradient (0.00493). In addition, using the mass conservation equation and Darcy's law, we derived a steady state model of the level of the groundwater table formed by trench irrigation, which required the five parameters mentioned above. The irrigated water spread over a distance of only about 15 in to both sides of the trench. The model also estimated that the distance for the irrigated area was 14.6 m and we concluded that the irrigated area was limited within a distance of 20 m distances to both sides of the trench and that the irrigation rate per unit trench length did not exceed 0.12 M-2 d(-1) for realistic values of the evapotranspiration rate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity in peatland.

AB Primary production in large areas of the open ocean is limited by low iron concentrations. Rivers are potential sources of iron to the ocean, however, riverine iron is prone to intense flocculation and sedimentation in the estuarine mixing zone. Here we report the detection of iron-rich nanoparticles in a typical peatland-draining creek which are resistant against salt-induced flocculation i.e., their behavior is in sharp contrast to the well-known behavior of Fe colloids in river waters. Sample fractionation by AsFlFFF (Asymmetric Flow Field Flow Fractionation) revealed that these powerful iron carriers are in the size range of only 0.5-3.0 nm hydrodynamic diameter. They were isolated from the water phase using solid phase extraction/gel permeation chromatography, and analyzed by a CuO oxidation/GC-MS method. Our results suggest that the particles consist mainly of lignin catabolites and that gymnosperm as well as angiosperm tissues are contributors to the seawater-resistant iron-bearing DOM. Lignin phenols, which have no autochthonous source in the ocean, have been nevertheless found in low concentrations throughout the entire Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans. It is therefore tempting to speculate that peatland-derived iron-bearing lignin particles may have a sufficiently long half-life in ocean waters to sustain iron concentration in extended regions of the ocean.

AB Minerotrophic peatlands or fen mires are characterized by anaerobic conditions and subsequently by a delayed litter decomposition. Therefore, in spite of their relatively small global area proportion (approx. 3%), peatlands constitute important sinks for carbon and nitrogen compounds with approx. 30% of the world's terrestric reserves. Degraded by substantial drainage or cultivation peatlands with changing water tables convert from CIN sinks to C/N sources, because of strongly increased C and N mineralization processes. It was shown that such degraded peatlands release high rates of the radiatively active trace gas nitrous oxide. The groundwater table, mineral- N fertilization, and stage of degradation are major factors affecting the nitrous oxide release. To give reasons for measures reducing nitrous oxide emission from peatlands, further studies are needed focussing, on e.g., the influence of weather or vegetation or derivations to give evidence for large-scale areas, respectively.

AB Recognition of the importance of peatlands has led to increased efforts to protect and restore these environments but there are concerns about the impact of restoration on water quality, particularly in terms of sediment delivery, nutrient transport and carbon losses. In this study we present the results of almost 10 years of water quality monitoring in 3 catchments at a lowland raised bog that was afforested with conifers in the 1960s and 1970s and cleared over the 2010s.
   Phosphate concentrations increased after clear-felling with the main peaks seen in the summer after forest clearance; the use of low ground impact harvesting methods, removal of forest residues and especially phased felling tempered phosphate losses. Annual mean phosphate concentrations returned to pre-felling levels 3-5 years after felling finished. Nitrate concentrations increased slightly from baseline levels during and after felling. DOC concentrations increased at two sites with mean annual concentrations still elevated at one site after 4 years; little increase in DOC was recorded with phased felling. Colour levels increased and remain elevated at all sites relative to pre-felling. In only one stream, pH increased improving the WFD water body status from 'poor' to 'high' in the space of 3 years.
   Our results show that forest clearance for peatland restoration can impact negatively upon water quality due to phosphate, DOC, colour and suspended sediment releases. The mechanisms by which the releases occur require further investigation but are thought to be driven by nutrient leaching from forest residues, soil disturbance by machine trafficking and indirect effects of forest clearance, such as water table rise following cessation of forest water use. Climatic effects also play a significant role, particularly drying-rewetting cycles and periods of extended drought. To prevent negative impacts, phased felling and less intensive forest harvesting techniques should be employed. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Degradation of freshwater ecosystems has engendered legislative mandates for the protection and management of surface waters while groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) have received much less attention. This is so despite biodiversity and functioning of GDEs are currently threatened by several anthropogenic stressors, particularly intensified land use and groundwater contamination. We assessed the impacts of land drainage (increased input of dissolved organic carbon, DOC, from peatland drainage) and impaired groundwater chemical quality (NO3--N enrichment from agricultural or urban land use) on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in 20 southern Finnish cold-water springs using several taxonomic and functional measures. Groundwater contamination decreased macroinvertebrate and bacterial diversity and altered their community composition. Changes in macroinvertebrate and bacterial communities along the gradient of water-quality impairment were caused by the replacement of native with new taxa rather than by mere disappearance of some of the original taxa. Also species richness of habitat specialist (but not headwater generalist) bryophytes decreased due to impaired groundwater quality. Periphyton accrual rate showed a subsidy-stress response to elevated nitrate concentrations, with peak values at around 2500 mu g L-1, while drainage-induced spring water brownification (increased DOC) reduced both periphyton accrual and leaf decomposition rates already at very low concentrations. Our results highlight the underutilized potential of ecosystem-level functional measures in GDE bioassessment as they seem to respond to the first signs of spring ecosystem impairment, at least for the anthropogenic stressors studied by us.

AB Freshwater wetlands provide a range of ecosystem services, one of which is climate regulation. They are known to contain large pools of carbon (C) that can be affected by land-use change. In New Zealand, only 10 % of the original freshwater wetlands remain due to conversion into agriculture. This study presents the first national estimation of C stocks in freshwater wetlands based on the compilation of soil carbon data from 126 sites across the country. We estimated C stocks for two soil sample types (mineral and organic) in different classes of wetlands (fen, bog, swamp, marsh, pakihi and ephemeral), and extrapolated C stocks to national level using GIS. Bogs had high C content and low bulk densities, while ephemeral wetlands were the reverse. A regression between bulk density and C content showed a high influence of the soil type. Average C densities (average +/- A standard error) were 1,348 +/- A 184 t C ha(-1) at full peat depth (average of 3.9 m) and 102 +/- A 5 t C ha(-1) (0.3 m depth) for organic soils, and 121 +/- A 24 t C ha(-1) (0.3 m depth) for mineral soils. At national level, C stocks were estimated at 11 +/- A 1 Mt (0.3 m depth) and 144 +/- A 17 Mt (full peat depth) in organic soils, and 23 +/- A 1 Mt (0.3 m depth) in mineral soils. Since European settlement, 146,000 ha of organic soils have been converted to agriculture, which could release between 0.5 and 2 Mt CO2 year(-1), equivalent to 1-6 % of New Zealand's total agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

AB The combustion of peat for energy generation accounts for approximately 4.1% of Ireland's overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with current levels of combustion resulting in the emission of 2.8 Mt of CO2 per annum. The aim of this research is to evaluate the life cycle environmental impacts of peat use for energy generation in Ireland, from peatland drainage and industrial extraction, to transportation, combustion, and subsequent after-use of the cutaway area, utilising Irish-specific emission factors. The environmental impacts considered are global warming potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential. In addition, the cumulative energy demand of the system is evaluated. Previous studies on the environmental impact of peat for energy in Ireland relied on default Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors (EFs). This research utilises Irish-specific EFs and input data to reduce uncertainty associated with the use of default IPCC EFs, and finds that using default IPCC EFs overestimates the global warming potential when compared to Irish-specific EFs by approximately 2%. The greatest contribution to each of the environmental impacts considered arises from emissions generated during peat combustion, which accounts for approximately 95% of each of the environmental impact categories considered. Other stages of the life-cycle, such as impacts emanating from the peat extraction area, fossil fuel usage in harvesting and transportation machinery, and after-use of the cutaway area have much smaller effects on overall results. The transformation of cutaway peatlands to different after-use alternatives has the potential to mitigate some of the effects of peatland degradation and peat combustion.

AB Although studies have shown that peatland drainage and harvesting alter local hydrology, microclimate, and peat characteristics, little is known about the effects of these changes on CO2 production rates. This study examines the different factors affecting CO2 production from natural and cutover peatlands. Laboratory peat incubations were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to determine the influence of temperature, soil moisture, and peat depth on CO2 production rates from peat samples taken from: (1) a natural peatland; (2) a 2-year post-cutover peatland and; (3) a 7-year post-cutover peatland.
   CO2 production rates ranged from 0.21 to 4.87 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions, and from 0.37 to 15.69 mu mol g(-1) d(-1) in the aerobic trials. While no significant differences were found between the CO2 production rates of the two cutover sites, the natural site consistently displayed higher production values. The natural site was also the only site to exhibit strong depth dependent trends, thus indicating the importance of the upper peat layer with respect to substrate quality. Higher production rates were found under aerobic than anaerobic conditions, with the greatest response to oxygen observed at the natural site. Production rates increased with both temperature and soil moisture, with maximum production rates found at 20 degreesC and 92% moisture content. Temperature responses were generally greater at the cutover sites, while soil moisture had greater effects on the natural site peat.
   Results of this work agree with previous studies that suggest that it is essential to begin restoration once a cutover peatland is abandoned. Re-wetting a cutover peatland (through restoration practices) is necessary to prevent an increase in peat temperature and CO2 production since cutover peat has higher Q(10) values than natural peat. A decrease in overall peatland oxidation should reduce the persistent source of atmospheric CO2 from cutover peatlands and the irreversible changes in peat structure that impede Sphagnum re-establishment.

AB Demand for water from catchments dominated by upland peat as a source of drinking water supplies in the UK is likely to increase in the future as demand per capita continues to rise (Thomsen 1990) and/or summer droughts increase in frequency (Arnell 1992). Concern has been expressed in recent pears over rising colour levels (related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron (Fe)) from such catchments (e.g. Kay et al. 1989) causing reduced drinking water quality. One of the major causes of increased DOC concentrations is rewetting following periods of relative drought (Mitchell & McDonald 1992). Experimental rewetting of a naturally drained wetland in Mid-Wales over four years was found to substantially increase the concentrations of DOC, and Fe in the pore-water, with peak values of >60 mg dm(-3) (Fe) and >300 mg dm(-3) (DOC) after rewetting, compared with typical values of <1 mg dm(-3) (Fe) and <15 mg dm(-3) (DOC) under the drained conditions. Seasonal peak concentrations of Fe and DOC have since remained at these higher levels. Rewetting produced a selective enrichment of the >5000 to <90 000 apparent molecular weight (AMW) material and this fraction was found to yield peak Fe concentrations. Two additional peaks of DOC mere also found in the experimental wetland (not present in the control wetland), of >90 000 to <200 000 AMW and >200 000 AMW material. The AMW spectrum of DOC in the experimental wetland changed with season, and the >90 000 to <200 000 AMW fraction could only be seen in spring, representing a transient pool of carbon that is rapidly transformed in or transported from the wetland. These findings suggest that rewetting of peatland following drought (e.g, due to climate change) has the potential to reduce water quality. Moreover, recent interest in restoration (rewetting) of drained peatlands (Wheeler & Shaw 1995) could create an additional source of DOC rich water.

AB Many endangered plant species remain absent in rewetted, previously drained fens.
   We performed a 3-year introduction experiment with endangered fen species (9 Carex- and 6 bryophyte species) in 4 hydrologically restored fens to investigate which factors hamper establishment and survival. Carex species were introduced as adults and seedlings, mosses as gametophytes. Introductions were done on (initially) bare soil, which allowed us to exclude excessive competition for light during the first year.
   First year survival of the transplants was high in all fens (mean survival = 96%), indicating that there were no direct abiotic constraints on establishment. However, survival analysis revealed that a decrease in relative light intensity (RLI) at the soil surface during consecutive years (indicating an increase in biotic competition for light) drove high mortality rates in most species. As a result, overall final survival was lowest in the two most productive (low light) fens (mean survival = 38%), while most transplants persisted in the two less productive (high light) fens (mean survival = 79%). Taller and faster-growing Carex species were able to outgrow light limitation near the soil surface, and thus had a higher overall survivability than smaller and slower-growing species. Light limitation also drove the loss of 5 out of 6 bryophyte species.
   We conclude that both dispersal limitation and asymmetric competition for light may explain the lack and loss of small and endangered plant species in rewetted fens. A minimum empirical threshold of c. 30% relative light intensity near the soil surface is required for successful introduction.

AB The arsenic contamination of aquifers has been linked to the input of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In light of this suggestion, the aim of this study was to quantify chemical effects of DOM on desorption and redox transformations of arsenic bound to synthetic iron oxide and natural samples from different geochemical environments (soils, shallow aquifer, lake sediment). In batch experiments, solutions containing 25-50 mg/L of two different types of DOM (purified peat humic acid and DOM from a peat drainage) were used as extractants in comparison to inorganic solutions. DOM solution was able to mobilize arsenic from all solid phases. Mobilization from iron oxides (maximum: 53.3%) was larger than from natural samples (maximum: 2.9%). The mobilization effect of extractants decreased in the order HCl > NaH2PO4 > DOM > NaNO3. DOM solutions, therefore, mainly targeted weakly sorbed arsenic. Mobilization was complete within 24-36 h and DOM was sorbed during incubation indicating competition for sorption sites. The same patterns were observed for different DOM types and concentrations. Addition of DOM lead to (a) enhanced reduction (maximum 7.8%) and oxidation (6.4%) of arsenic in aqueous solution and (b) the appearance of arsenite in aqueous phase of soil samples (5.5%). As the primary mechanism for the arsenic release from solid phases we identified the competition between arsenic and organic anions for sorption sites, whereas redox reactions were probably of minor importance. The results of this study demonstrate that sorption of DOM has a strong potential to mobilize arsenic from soils and sediments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrochernical sampling of South Pennine (UK) headwater streams draining eroded upland peatlands demonstrates these systems are nitrogen saturated, with significant leaching of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), particularly ammonium, during both stormflow and baseflow conditions. DIN leaching at sub-catchment scale is controlled by geomorphological context; in catchments with low gully densities ammonium leaching dominates whereas highly gullied catchments leach ammonium and nitrate since lower water tables and increased aeration encourages nitrification. Stormflow flux calculations indicate that: approximately equivalent amounts of nitrate are deposited and exported; ammonium export significantly exceeds atmospheric inputs. This suggests two ammonium sources: high atmospheric loadings; and mineralisation of organic nitrogen stored in peat. Downstream trends indicate rapid transformation of leached ammonium into nitrate. It is important that low-order headwater streams are adequately considered when assessing impacts of atmospheric loads on the hydrochemistry of stream networks, especially with respect to erosion, climate change and reduced precipitation.

AB Peatlands act as CO(2) sinks that store more soil carbon per unit area than any other ecosystem. Increased aeration and subsequent oxidation following drainage causes peatlands to lose carbon and leads to a relative increase in the concentration of inorganic compounds. To infer carbon losses as a result of drainage, we studied four sites in Central Europe with different drainage states and land-use histories. We used differences in ash content of both catotelm peat and near-surface layers as well as the results of soil carbon inventories. The method yielded reasonable results, at least for two drained sites, where the mean loss rates varied between 0.14 and 0.49 kg C m(-2) a(-1). Comparison with a pristine bog showed that a relative increase of ash content is not unique to drained sites and that previous land management also affected natural peatlands with concomitant losses similar in magnitude to their drained counterparts. Rehabilitation of a previously drained site dissipated the original ash peak profile. In conclusion, the method is suitable for predicting carbon losses from ombrotrophic bogs under certain conditions but in countries with a long-lasting tradition of anthropogenic interference it is impossible to attribute drainage as the only factor governing relative increases in ash content in ombrotrophic peatlands.

AB The growing demand for agricultural products has been leading to an expansion and intensification of agriculture around the world. More and more unused land is currently reclaimed in the regions of the former Soviet Union. Driven by climate change, the Western Siberian grain belt might, in a long-term, even expand into the drained peatland areas to the North. It is crucial to study the consequences of this land-use change with respect to the carbon cycling as this is still a major knowledge gap.
   We present for the first time data on the atmosphere-ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide and methane of an arable field and a neighboring unused grassland on peat soil in Western Siberia. Eddy covariance measurements were performed over one vegetation period. No directed methane fluxes were found due to an effective drainage of the study sites. The carbon dioxide fluxes appeared to be of high relevance for the global carbon and greenhouse gas cycles. They showed very site-specific patterns resulting from the development of vegetation: the persistent plants of the grassland were able to start photosynthesizing soon after snow melt, while the absence of vegetation on the managed field lead to a phase of emissions until the oat plants started to grow in June. The uptake peak of the oat field is much later than that of the grassland, but larger due to a rapid plant growth. Budgeting the whole measurement period, the grassland served as a carbon sink, whereas the oat field was identified to be a carbon source. The conversion from non-used grasslands on peat soil to cultivated fields in Western Siberia is therefore considered to have a positive feedback on climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we quantify carbon sources and sinks in main ecosystems (forests, peatlands, mountains, agricultural areas, lakes) in Norway for 1990-2008, and compare riverine carbon transport with terrestrial carbon accumulation in Norway's four major discharge areas. Mean annual carbon accumulation (6.0 +/- A 0.9 Tg C; 19 g C m(-2)) in terrestrial ecosystems balanced 40 % of national greenhouse gas emissions. The area-normalized terrestrial sink strength declined in the following order (in g C m(-2) year(-1)): tree biomass (40 +/- A 3) > peatlands (19 +/- A 15) > forest soils (9 +/- A 1) a parts per thousand << lakes (2 +/- A 1) > mountains (0.5 +/- A 0.3), while agricultural soils were sources of carbon (-36 +/- A 74). The most precise estimate in the carbon balance was for tree biomass, because of the underlying forest inventory data. Poor data on land management and soil type in agricultural soils, and on (former) drainage and peatland type resulted in high uncertainty in carbon loss and uptake estimates in agricultural soils and peatlands, which impacted the uncertainty in total terrestrial carbon accumulation. Also, carbon losses from disturbance in organic soil types were poorly constrained. Riverine coastal inputs of land-derived organic carbon (OC) were 1.0 +/- A 0.1 Tg C year(-1) (3.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)), with highest area-specific riverine export in western (4.5 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and lowest (1.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)) in subarctic Norway. In west and middle Norway, river OC export was approximately equal to carbon accumulation in soils and wetlands, while it was 50 % of soil and wetland carbon accumulation in southeast and subarctic Norway. Lateral aquatic transport of carbon is not explicitly accounted for in forest soil carbon accumulation estimates, although aquatic fluxes represent a climate-dependent carbon loss from soil carbon pools. The lack of methods that adequately account for lateral fluxes in carbon balances adds considerable uncertainty to soil carbon sink estimates. Climate warming and associated changes in precipitation may result in substantial alterations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes, with uncertain implications for the terrestrial carbon sink of northern landscapes.

AB Endophytes are microorganisms living inside plant hosts and are known to be beneficial for the host plant vitality. In this study, we isolated three endophytic fungus species from the roots of Scots pine seedlings growing on Finnish drained peatland setting. The isolated fungi belonged to dark septate endophytes (DSE). The metabolic profiles of the hot water extracts of the fungi were investigated using Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detection and Electron Spray Ionization source Mass Spectrometry with Orbitrap analyzer (UPLC-DAD-ESI-MS-Orbitrap). Out of 318 metabolites, we were able to identify 220, of which a majority was amino acids and peptides. Additionally, opine amino acids, amino acid quinones, Amadori compounds, cholines, nucleobases, nucleosides, nucleotides, siderophores, sugars, sugar alcohols and disaccharides were found, as well as other previously reported metabolites from plants or endophytes. Some differences of the metabolic profiles, regarding the amount and identity of the found metabolites, were observed even though the fungi were isolated from the same host. Many of the discovered metabolites have been described possessing biological activities and properties, which may make a favorable contribution to the host plant nutrient availability or abiotic and biotic stress tolerance.

AB The effects of the application of wood ash and of fertilizer regimes including phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), with and without simultaneous addition of nitrogen (N), were investigated on a stand of Scots pine (Pinus. sylvestris L.) saplings growing on a drained oligotrophic peatland site in southern Sweden. A randomized block design was used. Tree growth and concentrations of various elements in the needles were measured. The addition of similar doses of P (approx. 40 kg P ha(-1)) from different sources resulted in similar growth responses, amounting to 1.6-1.9 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) of stem wood over the 26-year study. The P source was either wood ash (2500 kg d.w. ha(-1)) or PK-fertilizer (raw phosphate and potassium chloride). In response to several treatments there were both increased numbers of trees and increased growth of individual trees. The high PK-dose (40 kg P ha(-1) and 80 kg K ha(-1)) appeared to result in a larger growth increase than the low dose (20 kg P ha(-1) and 40 kg K ha(-1)). The N treatment had no additional effect on growth. In the control plots, tree growth was more or less negligible (0.04 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)). After almost 26 years, concentrations of P and K in the needles of treated plants were still higher than in the untreated control plants. Nevertheless, in spite of the elevated P concentration, P appears to limit the growth of Scots pine. In conclusion, after sufficient drainage of this type of peatland site, it is possible for a forest stand to develop to the pole stage if wood ash or PK-fertilizer is applied.

AB Peatland headwater streams are consistently supersaturated with respect to gaseous C and are known to degas CO2 and CH4 directly to the atmosphere. Using a combination of injection of a purposeful gas tracer (propane) and a soluble tracer (NaCl) we carried out 49 measurements of the gas transfer coefficient on 12 representative stream reaches to quantify the gas transfer rates of CO2 and CH4 in headwater (1st-3rd order) streams draining six UK peatlands. These were compared to measured stream reach physical variables, such as discharge and water travel time. Whilst we found that evasion rates were highly variable in space and time, (gas transfer coefficient of CO2) was positively related to discharge. Individual study sites showed a high degree of variability in gas transfer rates; at all 49 sites median/mean values for were 0.087/0.157 and 0.092/0.176 min(-1). Median/mean instantaneous CO2 and CH4 evasion rates were 133/367 and 0.22/1.45 mu g C m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Methane evasion rates were therefore more than two orders of magnitude lower than CO2, with CH4 invasion (rather than evasion) measured on 37 % of occasions. Our gas flux measurements from peatland headwater streams are higher than values previously used to estimate landscape scale fluxes and emphasise the importance of the evasion flux term in the overall carbon balance.

AB There is growing interest in the restoration of blanket bogs that were afforested during the 1960s to 1980s, to avoid further loss of carbon to the atmosphere and to regain and defragment important blanket bog habitat. This paper reports the findings from a ten-year experiment in the UK to test the effectiveness of restoration treatments on water table depth, peat bulk density and water content, ground surface height and vegetation development. Treatments used were the six combinations of damming or not damming plough furrows with leaving the trees alive, felling and leaving them on the ground or felling and removing them. Combining felling with damming furrows was most successful in raising the water table, whether or not the felled trees were removed. Only where felling was combined with damming did the water table continue to recover between Years 5 and 10. Over ten years, the water level in these treatments rose to slightly below that of non-afforested reference bog at the same sites. This occurred as a rapid initial rise, following which there was only very slight further improvement. Felling caused the species composition of the vegetation to change towards that of the reference bogs. The process was slow, with the vegetation becoming more dissimilar to non-forested reference bog in the first five years and then becoming more similar to the reference bog after Year 5. Surprisingly, damming plough furrows had little effect on the vegetation except that, in combination with felling, it increased differentiation between the plough furrows and other positions on the ploughed ground. Conifer seedlings established on the restored plots, most densely where they adjoined standing forest, and had similar density and growth in all the felled treatments. The restoration treatments resulted in a decrease in bulk density and increase in water content of the upper peat, probably due to an unloading effect caused by the raised water table buoying up the drained peat layer. In some treatments this was amplified by removal of the weight of the trees. Damming the plough furrows caused a 5-7 cm rise in ground surface height, suggesting that subsidence resulting from primary consolidation and secondary compression is at least partly reversible.

DE pine bog; peat; bulk density; chemical properties; fertilization
AB Bulk densities and chemical properties of surface peat (0-60 cm) of three ombrotrophic pine bogs were measured before and three growing seasons after fertilization. One site was located in each of the countries Norway, Sweden and Finland. Bulk density of peat ranged from 56 in Norway, 78 in Sweden to 130 g dm(-3) in Finland. Bulk density seems to vary along a sub-coastal to sub-continental gradient for the bog type. When compared to the biological demands of the tree stands, the surface peat stores of extractable K, P and B were low before fertilization. Depletion from the peat on fertilized plots (uptake and/or leaching) were rather high for K, B, Mn and Zn. Especially the sodium borate (borax fertilizer) was susceptible to leaching. Only minor changes occurred in pH and cation exchange capacity after fertilization, whereas base saturation was raised, especially in the upper layer (010 cm). A high proportion of total K, Ca, Mg, Mn and Zn were on exchangeable sites (63-92%), while P, S. B and Fe were mainly fixed (72-95%). Estimated net carbon loss from the peat at drainage was 100 g C m(-2) year(-1), while at additional fertilization the loss was only 6 g.

AB Peatlands can export large amounts of carbon in various forms, including surface gas emissions and the discharge of dissolved carbon under aerobic/anaerobic soil degradation. Therefore, an apparent imbalance can be expected between gaseous CO2 production and O-2 consumption in unsaturated peat layers. The present study monitored profiles of soil CO2 and O-2 in Bibai mire, Hokkaido, Japan, with the aim of examining the apparent imbalance between the two gases. The CO2 abundance to the atmospheric level did not exceed the O-2 deficit because the CO2 concentrations were 0.21, 0.75 and 2.92%, whereas the O-2 concentrations were 19.71, 18.05 and 9.51% at depths of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively. This shortage of CO2 abundance implied that a remarkable amount of CO2 dissolved into the liquid phase. The dissolved CO2 mass on the basis of Henry's law ranged from 1.72 to 159.3 mmol m(-2) (10 cm)(-1), and was 1.59-5.25-fold greater than the gaseous CO2 mass. The mass balance analyses showed that the CO2 production rate in the gaseous phase at a depth of 20 cm ranged from 6.52 to 23.11 mmol m(-2) (10 cm)(-1) day(-1), equivalent to 43% on average of the O-2 consumption rate. This CO2 production rate contributed to less than 10% of the gaseous CO2 produced in the unsaturated peat layer, which had a maximum thickness of 40 cm, implying the existence of a large CO2 source in the peat layer, including in the saturated zone. The mass balance analyses also showed that the residence time of CO2 in the gaseous phase alone was 0.351 day, whereas that in the whole peat soil matrix was 0.919 day at a depth of approximately 20 cm, suggesting that high water content serves as a tentative storage for gaseous CO2 in peatlands.

AB Despite the continuing interest in various plant and natural products, only a small portion of the biologically active compounds from nature has been discovered and exploited. In this study, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of aqueous fractions of three endophytic fungi isolated from the roots of 8-year-old Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) growing on a drained peatland were investigated. The endophytic fungi species were Acephala applanata, Phialocephala fortinii, and Humicolopsis cephalosporioides/Coniochaeta mutabilis. The bioactivities were examined using hydrogen peroxide scavenging and oxygen radical absorbance capacity tests as well as sensitive Escherichia coli-based biosensors, which produce a luminescent signal in the presence of substances with oxidative or genotoxic properties. In addition, cell models for Parkinson's disease, age-related macular degeneration, and osteoarthritis were used to evaluate the potential for pharmaceutical applications. The aqueous extracts of fungi and 19 out of 42 fractions were found to be active in one or more of the tests used. However, no activity was found in the age-related macular degeneration and osteoarthritis cell model tests. Additionally, bioactivity data was connected with metabolites putatively annotated, and out of 330 metabolites, 177 were interesting in view of the bioactivities investigated. A majority of these were peptides and all three fungal species shared a highly similar metabolome. We propose that Scots pine endophytic fungi are a rich source of interesting metabolites, and synergistic effects may cause the bioactivities, as they were found to vary after the fractionation process.

AB The power and heat production in Estonia is based over 90% on the combustion of a local solid fossil fuel-Estonian oil shale (OS), and at that 7-8 million tons of OS ash are formed annually. One promising possibility for large-scale utilization of cheap alkali ashes is the liming of acidic soils. In Estonia, there is 350,000 ha of agricultural land that needs permanent liming. To eliminate possible environmental contamination at liming of soils the oil shale ashes should be granulated. Thermal analysis was used for determination of the relationships between physico-mechanical and physico-chemical characteristics of granulated products and the post-granulation treatment conditions. For determination of leachability of ash components, the granulated products as well as the origin ashes were tested using laboratory lysimetries. Depending on OS ash and different post-granulation treatment used, it was possible to obtain granulated product with compressive strength between 5 and 15 N per granule. The leaching of Ca2+ decreased up to 26 and 34%, SO4 (2-) 70 and 53%, Mg2+ and K+ up to 7-12% for granulated CA and ESPA, respectively, comparing with original ashes. The results of soil analysis indicate that the use of OS ashes improved the pH level of soil significantly. pH increased equally with initial and granulated ash: from 4.7 up to 6.4 and 5.8, respectively, using for that CA and ESPA. Prolonged effect of soil neutralizing ability by granulated product (if compare with fine ashes) was proven by decrease in the content of leached ions in filtrate solutions as well as not mobile ions in soil.

AB Rewetting of drained industrial peatlands may reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promote recolonisation by peat forming plant species. We investigated carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics over a three-year period in a rewetted industrial peatland in Ireland. Sample plots were established in bare peat, Juncus effusus-Sphagnum cuspidatum, Sphagnum cuspidatum and Eriophorum angustifolium dominated microsites. The relationships between fluxes and environmental variables were examined and regression models were used to provide an estimate of the annual GHG balance for each microsite. All the vegetated microsites were carbon sinks for the duration of the study. Highest uptake occurred in the Eriophorum microsite (146-583 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by Juncus-Sphagnum (35-204 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and Sphagnum (5-140 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The bare peat microsite was a source of 37-82 g C m(-2) yr(-1). No N2O fluxes were detected. Strong inter-annual variation was observed in all microsites, driven by variation in precipitation and subsequent changes in the position of the water table. In terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP), the microsites had either a cooling effect (Eriophorum), a close to neutral effect (Juncus-Sphagnum, Sphagnum) or a warming effect (bare peat) on the climate.

AB The ecological status of water bodies in large protected areas (national park, biosphere reserve, natural park) has been markedly improved during the last decades. Active restoration measures, decrease of liquid and gaseous emissions and changes in land use led to an improvement and stabilization of water-quality. Acidification of metarhitral brook reaches in lower mountainous areas has decreased; canals and ditches in fens serve today also for maintenance of moor landscapes. Restored and re-connected oxbow lakes serve as optimal habitat for fauna and flora of the river and the floodplain. The very different water bodies of the large protected areas in the Harz Mountains, in the Elbe floodplain and in the Dromling fen represent today regional hotspots and refuges of aquatic biodiversity.

AB The results of 25 years of observations (1992-2017) on 20 permanent key plots (PKP), founded near Priladozhskaya educational-scientific field station of St. Petersburg University (150 km North of St. Petersburg) are analyzed. The PKP are located in the landscape of North-Western Ladoga Region, in the most typical landscape sites: on the tops and slopes of selga (ridges composed of Archean and lower Proterozoic granitoids and treated by glacier), terraces on lacustrine clays and loam, peat bogs of various types, etc. When locating the PKP, typical plant communities were chosen (pine, spruce, mixed and small-leaved forests, pine woodlands, overgrown meadows) and the most characteristic impacts (forest fires, selective cuttings, windfalls, recent use in agriculture, drainage, and others). The most dynamic landscape in the North-Western Ladoga Region are terraces on lacustrine clay and loam, for a long time used in agriculture. Currently, processes of overgrowing realized at a 7 landscape-dynamic trajectories are taking place. In other landscape sites, changes of a long-term state are initiated mainly by fires and windfall, and subsequent processes of forest regeneration. In addition, the change of tree species in forests can occur when small-leaved trees reach their maximal biological age. The landscape sites of upper slopes of ridges and drained peat bogs with a predominance of pine forests in the absence of catastrophic impacts are the most stable.

AB Peatland ecosystems are generally carbon (C) sinks. However, the role of dissolved organic C (DOC) relative to gaseous fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in the C balance of these ecosystems has not often been studied. Dissolved C fluxes are important for understanding C partitioning within the peatland and the potential C drainage from it. This research was conducted in Burns Bog, a heavily impacted ecosystem near Vancouver, Canada, undergoing ecological restoration efforts by rewetting. Here we present data on (i) ecosystem-scale fluxes of CO2 (net ecosystem exchange, NEE) and CH4 (FCH4) determined by eddy covariance, (ii) evasion fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from the water surface to estimate the role of open water in ecosystem-scale fluxes, and (iii) DOC flux (fDOC) in water draining from the peatland. Our results showed that open water areas inside the footprint were a continual C source, emitting 47.0 +/- 2.4 g C.m(-2).year(-1). DOC export (15.6 g C.m(-2).year(-1)) was significant to the net ecosystem C balance, decreasing the magnitude of the eddy covariance-determined C balance (i.e., NEE + FCH4) of -45.0 +/- 16.8 g C.m(-2).year(-1) by 35%, resulting in a net ecosystem C balance (i.e., NEE + FCH4 + fDOC) of-29.7 +/- 17.0 g C.m(-2).year(-1). Most of this offset occurred during the wetter nongrowing season when gross primary production was low and fDOC was relatively high.
   Plain Language Summary Healthy peatlands can store large amounts of carbon, but disturbance may turn a peatland into a carbon emitter. We studied the amount of carbon entering and leaving a disturbed peatland that has recently undergone ecological restoration by rewetting. We measured climate conditions and ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes in Burns Bog, a heavily impacted raised bog in the Fraser River Delta, BC, Canada. We also collected water samples and estimated evasion fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from the open water, as well as drainage fluxes of dissolved organic carbon. From these data, we estimated the amount of carbon entering and leaving the ecosystem. We found that open water areas continually emit carbon to the atmosphere, but the ecosystem as a whole is accumulating carbon on an annual basis. Accounting for the dissolved carbon exported by water reduces the estimates of carbon accumulation based on gas fluxes alone. These results have implications for restoration management of peatlands, which mainly consist of raising the water table level, and the role of peatland ecosystems within the context of global climate change.

TI REMOTE-SENSING OF WATER-QUALITY IN THE SINGAPORE-JOHOR-RIAU GROWTH
   TRIANGLE
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID COLOR
AB Remote sensing has not been used extensively in southeast Asia for resource development, partly for reasons of perennial cloud cover and low image availability. However, the low level of awareness of remote sensing among planning and environmental agencies is unjustified in view of the capabilities of high spatial and spectral resolution sensors such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), coupled with a general lack of physical resources data throughout the region. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the application of Landsat MT imagery to the survey and monitoring of water quality in coastal regions affected by land drainage from peat swamp catchments, which are common in southeast Asia, thus where dissolved organic matter (yellow substance) dominates the volume reflectance of coastal water. The Thematic mapper 0.45-0.52 mum waveband was found to be capable of differentiating water with high concentration of yellow substance from nonplume water, but the addition of the 0.63-0.69 mum waveband was required for differentiating lower concentrations of yellow substance. The higher temperature of yellow substance dominated river plumes observed on the 10.5-12.5 mum waveband confirmed field observations. These findings have implications for water resource management in the region, since image derived classes of water quality can be related to environmental standards for the main types of water use.

AB 1. Hydrological changes due to drainage and climate warming can have great impact on the ecosystem balance of boreal mires. The possibility of ombrotrophication, i.e. the development from fen to bog, in response to altered hydrology has not been previously tested. Here, recent changes in vegetation and surface peat are studied in an aapa mire, a typical boreal mire system dominated by fen vegetation. Drainage in the catchment from 1968 onwards led to the change from richly minerogenous to ombrogenous hydrology, thus providing a long-term ombrotrophication experiment.
   2. A sequence of aerial photographs (1941, 1953, 1965, 1974, 1984, 1995, 2005) revealed a dramatic shift from fen vegetation to the nearly complete dominance of peat mosses (Sphagnum) within two decades after the catchment disturbance.
   3. A distinct change from Carex peat to Sphagnum peat at the average depth of 23.3 cm (SE 0.8 cm) was found in 18 peat cores. All of the new Sphagnum peat had accumulated within the last four decades. This was verified by the relationship of age and rooting depth of 37 small pines (Pinus sylvestris) and by two pollen density profiles. The ratio Ca/Mg diminished towards the surface of peat profiles indicating change from minerogenous to ombrogenous hydrology. In accordance, extremely low pH (range 3.8-4.2) and conductivity (average 14.5 mu s cm(-1)) were measured in the surface pore water.
   4. The average total dry mass of new Sphagnum peat was 7042 g m(-2) (SE 442) and the recent apparent rate of carbon accumulation was 100.6 g m(-2) year(-1) (SE 6.3), as calculated for a 35-year period and 50% carbon content.
   5. Synthesis. Remarkable potential for vegetation change and increase of peat growth is demonstrated in boreal aapa mires. Ombrotrophication can be initiated within a few decades in response to reduced input of minerogenous water. Future changes in the hydrological cycle, as indicated by climate change models, are similar to the impact of catchment disturbance in aapa mires. Diminished total water budgets during the summer cause a decrease of minerogenous input and a drawdown of water level, both of which may promote the growth of Sphagnum over fen vegetation.

AB Sheep landraces are an invigorating element in terms of the biodiversity of the cultural landscape. The present study focused on the question of whether the Bentheimer Landschaf breed, which is a representative of a large sheep landrace, is equally as well-suited for the maintenance of extensively farmed fen grassland as the smaller, hardy Skudde breed of sheep. For each breed, two flocks with 10 ewes and their lambs were included in a 3-year grazing trial on long-standing, extensively used fen grassland paddocks. Our study revealed no major differences between Skudde and Bentheimer Landschaf regarding feed preference, endozoochorous dispersal potential and reproductive performance. The food intake of both breeds was not only limited to high-quality forage grasses, they also chose more crude fiber-rich plant species. Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) was preferably selected. A relevant problem under set stocking conditions with alternate hay cutting was the spread of creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) on the paddocks of both sheep breeds. The majority of the germinable seeds found in fecal samples were contributed by the small-seeded grass species Poa trivialis L. and Agrostis stolonifera L., which were the most abundant in the vegetation of the paddocks. Juncus spp. seeds were found at above-average levels in the fecal samples compared with the vegetation percentages of these species. Among the weed species, only stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.) showed a higher endozoochorous dispersal potential. The greater slaughter weight of Bentheimer Landschaf lambs has a positive effect on the efficiency of sheep farming. Considering all of the studied characteristics, we concluded that large landrace Bentheimer Landschaf sheep as well as Skudde sheep may be only recommended for the maintenance of drained fen grassland if additional control strategies against the spread of thistles accompany grazing management.

AB The National Butterfly Recording Scheme in Finland (NAFI) is based on data collected using a uniform questionnaire for the whole country. During the first decade of the scheme ( 1991 - 2000), a total of 432 voluntary amateur and professional lepidopterists participated by providing data on 1.5 million individuals representing 94 indigenous and 11 non- resident species. Although the 10-year period is not long enough to provide extensive conclusions about changes in the fauna, changes in either the geographical distributions or population densities exhibited a downward trend for 15 species and an upward trend for 11 species. The decreased species were dominated by those inhabiting bogs and fens ( 4) and open sandy or rocky habitats ( 5), whereas the increased species were mainly typical of forest verges and clearings ( 8). The results indicated in particular the effects of drainage of peatlands and overgrowth of meadows. On the other hand, the distribution maps published in the national bulletin revealed northward expansion for seven species, which, together with some increasing migrants, may indicate the effects of possible climatic warming. By providing quantitative knowledge of possible changes in the distribution and abundance of butterflies, NAFI may be used to protect the Finnish butterfly fauna.

AB The wetlands of the James Bay Lowland comprise one of largest wetland complexes in the world, in part due to the properties (thickness and hydraulic conductivity) of the marine sediment (MS) that underlay them. Dewatering of an open-pit diamond mine is depressurizing the surrounding Silurian bedrock below the MS. Prior to mining, it was assumed that these MS would largely isolate the overlying peatlands from the depressurized regional bedrock aquifer. To assess this isolation, we instrumented a 1.5km long transect of wells and piezometers located within the zone of the mine's influence that crossed a sequence of bogs, fens, and bedrock outcrops (bioherms). Results were differentiated between those areas with no MS (near bioherms) and those underlain by MS (non-bioherm) along the transect. Between 2007 and 2010 at near-bioherm and non-bioherm locations, average peat water tables declined 71 and 31cm, and hydraulic head declined 66 and 32cm, in bioherm and non-bioherm locations, respectively. Gradients varied from near zero (-0.001) at the start of dewatering to -0.03 (after 5years) in non-bioherm areas and from -0.20 to -0.45 in near-bioherm areas. These gradients corresponded to fluxes (groundwater recharge) of approximately -0.26mm/day and -2.1mm/day, in non- and near-bioherm areas, respectively. Specific discharge (recharge) determined using the known mine dewatering rate and drawdown cone heads and areas corresponded well with measured recharge determined in the non-bioherm transect locations. A simple rearrangement of Darcy's Law used to calculate the specific discharge highlighted how the ratio of hydraulic conductivity to the thickness of the MS can be used to assess vulnerable areas. Therefore, given the increasing development in Ontario's Far North, considerable attention must be given to both the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of MS.

AB This study compares seasonal and spatial variations in methane fluxes as sources of uncertainty in regional CH4 flux upscaling from the wetlands of West Siberia. The study examined variability in summertime CH4 emissions from boreal peatlands, with a focus on two subtaiga fen sites in the southern part of West Siberia (Novosibirskaya oblast). We measured CH4 flux, water table depth, air and peat temperature, pH and electric conductivity of peat water during three field campaigns in summer 2011 (9-12 July, 26-28 July and 20-21 August). Fluxes were measured with static chambers at sites chosen to represent two of the most widespread types of wetlands for this climatic zone: soligenous poor fens and topogenous fens. In both sites the water table level acts as the primary control on fluxes. For the poor fen site with good drainage, water table controls CH4 fluxes on the seasonal scale but not on a local spatial scale; for the fen site with weak drainage and microtopographic relief, the water table controls fluxes on the local spatial scale, but does not drive seasonal variations in the flux magnitude. This difference in hydrology shows the necessity of including detailed wetland type classification schemes into large-scale modeling efforts. From these three measurement periods, we estimated the relative seasonal variation in CH4 emissions as 8% for the fen site and 26% for the poor fen site. These results were compared to estimates of other sources of uncertainty (such as interannual variation and spatial heterogeneity) to show that quantifying seasonal variability is less critical than these other variations for an improved estimate of regional CH4 fluxes. This research demonstrates and ranks the challenges in upscaling measured wetland CH4 fluxes across West Siberia and can guide future field campaigns.

AB Bog pine is an endangered species in Europe as drainage of bogs permits colonisation by Norway spruce, resulting in severe bog pine habitat loss in marginal bog forests, and a habitat shift towards the bog centre where growing conditions are extreme. Thus, we investigated the physiological causes that limit bog pine regeneration at the bog margins and growth in the centre. We measured needle nitrogen concentration, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic capacity and the morphological traits of bog pine and spruce along transects from the centre to the margin of a bog in the Black Forest, Germany. Needle nitrogen and chlorophyll contents in the bog pine increased from the centre to the margin. However, photosynthesis was independent of chlorophyll content indicating that other factors, such as light rather than nutrients, may limit regeneration of bog pine. Vitality of bog pine was highest at the edge of the bog centre. This zone appears to be a compromise between nutrient limitation and shallow water levels on the one hand, and light limitation caused by spruce on the other. Therefore, in order to conserve bog pine, it is necessary to maintain wet and open bog forests that cannot be colonised by spruce.

AB The poor fens of the Laforge region, northeastern Canada, have developed under subarctic conditions. They are characterized by a microtopography of large pools and low, narrow strings. Paleorecords suggest some of these systems were once ombrotrophic and relatively dry. Taking account of their current bioclimatic position, we aimed to explore the possible pathways towards the current wet state, a process referred to as "aqualysis". We combined paleoecological methods applied to a peat core with conceptual modelling to identify factors that might plausibly explain aqualysis. Reconstructions showed the Abeille peatland became minerotrophic with high water tables between 2400 and 2100 cal yr BP. Conceptual modelling, supported by simulations using the numerical DigiBog model, allowed us to identify the effects of cooling and increased precipitation on productivity, decay, peat hydraulic conductivity and vertical peat accumulation. Both cooling and increased precipitation were required for aqualysis to occur and for wet surface conditions to persist to the present day. Increased recharge from the catchment, which also restricted drainage from the peatland center laterally, was likely critical for the development of minerotrophic conditions. The scenario of cooling and wetting in these peatlands is supported by available paleoclimate records for eastern Canada.

AB 1. Peat formation is a key carbon sequestration process in the terrestrial biosphere. In temperate fens, peat is mainly formed by below-ground biomass of vascular plants. Nutrient availability in temperate fens is naturally variable, and nowadays increasing due to atmospheric deposition, runoff from agriculture and mineralization of peat caused by drainage. To maintain or restore peat formation, it is important to understand how increased nutrient availability influences the main controls of peat formation, that is, below-ground biomass production and decomposition.
   2. We investigated above- and below-ground biomass production and decomposition of five fen sedges (Carex spp.) grown under 12 different nutrient levels (realized with nitrogen amounts increasing exponentially across levels, with addition of phosphorous and potassium to ensure nitrogen limitation in each nutrient level) in a mesocosm experiment, designed to resemble a gradient of very low to very high nutrient availabilities in temperate fens. In addition, we measured nutrient stoichiometry in the biomass and related this to possible growth limitations and to root decomposition.
   3. Our results indicate that higher biomass production at higher nutrient levels was not offset by an increase in decomposition. Increase of above- and below-ground biomass with higher nutrient levels was species-specific. Decomposition of standardized plant material in mesocosms was not dependent on the species growing in the mesocosms and showed only slight, if any, variation with differing nutrient levels. Decomposition of roots grown under different nutrient levels was mainly correlated with species identity and root lignin:cellulose ratio.
   4. Our study suggests that the Carex spp. potentially peat-forming root biomass, here defined as the root biomass which is not decomposed during one growing season, increases with increasing nutrient levels: higher root biomass production is not counteracted by increasing decomposition during the growing season. Based on this pattern of positive mass balance in five common sedge species with differing growth characteristics, we propose that sedge communities establishing after rewetting have the potential for renewed peat formation regardless of the prevailing trophic level.

AB A number of experiments have been established at the Finnish Forest Research Institute during the last few decades to study the effect of wood ash application on soil substrate, ground vegetation and stand growth on drained mires and mineral soil forests. In this study, the plots of 23 experiments were sampled to determine whether ash application significantly increases heavy metal accumulation in forest berries and mushrooms. Both short-term (between 2 months and 4 years) and long-term effects (between 10 and 52 years after application) were studied. The heavy metal concentrations (Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Cu, Cd, As, Ni, Pb, Ti, V and Mo) were measured using ICP-AES. No significant increase in heavy metal accumulation in the cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and bog whortleberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) or in the caps and stipes of russule (Russula paludosa), rufous milk-cap (Lactarius rufus), northern milk-cap (Lactarius trivialis), velvet bolete (Suillus variegatus) and in-rolled paxil (Paxillus involutus) was usually observed. In contrast, in the older experiments (13-52 years), the concentrations were often lower than those in the controls, except for As. Cd concentrations in cloudberry, bog whortleberry, in-rolled paxil and rufous milk-cap occasionally decreased significantly. The results indicated that this ash-induced decrease in heavy metal accumulation may be a long-term effect. The concentrations of Al, Fe, As, Ni and Ti in the mushrooms were occasionally very high in the younger ash experiments (2-14 months after application); probably it was a case of surface contamination by heavy metal-rich ash residue, rather than active metal uptake. It was concluded that the heavy metals brought into the ecosystem by ash application are unlikely to be accumulated in any considerable amounts in forest berries and mushrooms. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lowland areas are characterized by specific properties, such as flat topography, low hydraulic gradients, shallow groundwater, and high potential for water retention in peatland and lakes. These characteristics and their dominating hydrological processes have to be assessed and considered for the analysis and modelling of water balances in lowland catchments. The capabilities and challenges of modelling hydrological processes and water balances in mesoscale lowland river basins with the SWAT model are presented. The investigated catchments Stor, Treene and Kielstau are located in northern Germany within a lowland area. Covering areas from 50 to 517 km(2), these rural meso-catchments have sandy, loamy and peaty soils. Drainage, in terms of tile drainage and open ditches, has changed the natural water balance. The set-up and modifications of the model as applied in these case studies can be transferred to other similar catchments in lowland areas. The dominating hydrological processes were found to be mainly controlled by groundwater dynamics and storage, drainage, wetlands and ponds. Some groundwater parameters were found to be highly sensitive and they turned out to be the most influential factors for improving simulated water discharge.

AB We investigated the diversity of brachionid rotifers in Thailand. Rotifers were collected from a wide range of habitat types (294 sites, 508 samples) including canals, lakes, peat swamps, ponds, reservoirs, rice fields, rivers, swamps and temporary ponds from April 1998 to January 2004. Twenty-eight species including 11 infrasubspecific forms belonging to five genera were identified. The most frequently encountered species was Brachionus falcatus (50.7% of the sampling sites), followed by Keratella cochlearis (50%), B. angularis (49.7%), K. tropica (46.3%) and B. forficula (45.9%). Less frequently encountered species were B. caudatus, B. durgae and B. urceolaris. These species were found in low abundances and only in a single site. Two sites in the Northeast - Nong Changpeuak and Bueng Srithat - recorded the greatest richness with 15 taxa, whereas no brachionid rotifers were found in 31 sites. On average, the species richness was five taxa per sampling site. A key to the genera and species of Thai brachionid rotifers is provided.

AB Leaching of previously deposited metals from atmospherically contaminated peat moorlands to receiving surface waters is an area of concern. Headwater streams in the Peak District National Park were sampled during baseflow and stormflow conditions to investigate the spatial and temporal variability in dissolved metal concentrations, the source of dissolved metals and the rote of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the mobilisation and transport of dissolved metals. Under baseflow and stormflow conditions, Cu, Ni, Pb, Ti, V and Zn concentrations are highly variable. The results of this study reveal that Cu, Ni, Pb, V and Zn are leached from the contaminated peat soils into headwater streams. Ni and Zn are mobile within the peatland fluviat system due to poor sorption of these metals to organic matter. Elevated Zn concentrations in the headwater streams can be explained by the severely acidic nature of surface waters in this region. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis reveals that the most important variable in explaining stormflow Pb, Ti and V concentrations is DOC. Due to the strong complexation of these metals by DOC, the export of dissolved Pb, Ti and V in peatland systems is likely to be controlled by DOC availability. Elevated stormflow dissolved Pb concentrations are due to the large store of Pb within the peat soils and high stream water DOC concentrations in surface waters of this upland area. Contemporary dissolved metal export from peat moorlands in the Peak District National Park may provide an analogue for future dissolved metal export in other contaminated peatland systems.

AB Draining fen areas seriously impairs ecosystem services as carbon ( C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) accumulation. Fen restoration has become central in management efforts to recover these ecosystem services in the face of global climate change and water eutrophication challenges. However, restoration has resulted in the creation of shallow lakes, rather than former pristine fen conditions. A new sediment layer, where C, N, and P accumulate, forms at these novel ecosystems, and differs from peat accumulation occurring in natural fens. We performed an initial estimate of C, N, and P accumulation in water inundated fens, and their potential as C, N and P sinks within the temperate area is discussed. Furthermore, the roles of topsoil removal and ecosystem age were considered. A set of abandoned peat extraction sites (n = 6), and rewetted fens (n = 6) were selected. The effects of topsoil removal prior to restoration are represented by the former sites, which were created 20-86 years ago; and the absence of topsoil removal was represented by the latter, which were established 7-20 years ago. Sediment cores were obtained, and OC, N, and P accumulation rates estimated. Fossil diatoms in the sediment layer-peat interface were evaluated to ascertain trophic conditions in the initial lake formation stages. Surface water quality was analysed to describe current trophic conditions. Our results determined C, N, and P accumulation rates at inundated fens (133.89 +/- 7.23 g C m(-2) y(-1); 9.60 +/- 0.57 g N m-2 y-1; 0.88 +/- 0.08 g P m(-2) y(-1)) were within the range of natural fens, and other temperate aquatic ecosystems. Topsoil removal prevented eutrophication, and decreased C, N, and P accumulation (P < 0.01), although it remains questionable how rewetted sites lacking topsoil removal will function in the long-term. Results demonstrated OM mineralisation has been an ongoing process in the new sediment layer for several decades, what does not occur in water saturated peat at undisturbed pristine fens.(C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Leaves of bilberry (V myrtillus), bog bilberry (V uliginosum) and downy birch (B. pubescens) were collected five times during a growing season from 18 plots in a drainage area, and needles of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) once during the following winter from the same plots at Parkano, southern Finland. The aim was to study the potassium nutrition of the test plants and relationships between the foliar potassium concentrations of Scots pine and of the test plants. The estimation of the potassium nutrition of test plants was based on the accumulation of putrescine in foliage. Apart from single observations, elevated putrescine concentrations were found when the potassium concentrations were <5 mg g(-1) in bilberry, <4 mg g(-1) in bog bilberry and <6 mg g(-1) in downy birch, and the highest concentrations below the potassium levels of 3.0-3.5 mg g(-1). At the concentrations of 2-3 mg g(-1) the accumulation increased pronouncedly in bog bilberry but less in downy birch and only slightly in bilberry. The foliar potassium concentrations in test plants correlated closely with the concentrations in pine needles. The concentrations of all species in August were quite stable at the levels of the severe and slight potassium deficiency of pine (3.5 and 4.5 mg g(-1) respectively) indicating that August would be suitable for collecting foliage. The concentrations in bog bilberry were very close to the concentrations in pine at the severe and those in bilberry at the slight deficiency level of pine. All test plants could be used for predicting the potassium nutrition of Scots pine, but additional research is needed for the practical application of the method.

AB The deglaciation of Nova Scotia is reconstructed using the AMS-dated chronology of lake sediments and buried organic sections exposed in the basins of former glacial lakes. Ice cleared out of the Bay of Fundy around 13.5 ka, punctuated by a brief readvance ca. 13-12.5 ka (Ice Flow Phase 4). Glacial Lake Shubenacadie (1) formed in central Nova Scotia, impounded by a lobe of ice covering the northern Bay of Fundy outlet. Drainage was re-routed to the Atlantic Ocean until the Fundy outlet became ice free after 12 ka. When this lake drained, bogs and fens formed on the lake plain during climatic warming. Organic sediment (gyttja) began to accumulate in lake basins throughout Nova Scotia. Glacierization during the Younger Dryas period (ca. 10.8 ka) resulted in the inundation of lakes and lake plains with mineral sediment. The nature and intensity of this mineral sediment flux or "oscillation" varies from south to northern regions. Southern lakes simply record changes in total organic content whereas northern lakes, where most buried peat sections are found, feature a thick inorganic sediment layer. Glacial ice or permanent snow cover and seasonal melting are essential in the formation of this mineral sediment layer; both to provide the water source for erosion, and to prevent plant re-colonization and landscape stabilization. Some northern lakes do not appear to record the Younger Dryas event, with organic accumulation starting around 10 ka. During the Younger Dryas, fine and coarse-grained deposits were deposited in Glacial Lake Shubenacadie (2) and other lowland areas at elevations similar to former (12 ka) lake levels, impounded by re-invigorated residual ice caps and permanent snow/ aufeis.

AB Minerotrophic mires (fens) represent an important part of the Northern peatlands (5*10(5) km(2)) and act as one of the most important sinks for terrestrial bond carbon and nitrogen. We have tried to clear up the influence of different management practices on nitrous oxide fluxes of these ecosystems. For this purpose investigations were performed on representative sites of the highly disturbed (degraded), N rich fen sites in Northeast Germany (5*10(3) ha): Paulinenaue (Rhin-Havelluch/Brandenburg, shallow cultivated grassland), Heinrichswalde (Friedlander Grobe Wiese/Mecklenburg-Vorpommem, deeply cultivated grassland), Muncheberg (Gumnitz, partially drained alder swamp forest). The annual flux rates showed a broad range. Especially newly drained fen sites (up to 26,9 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*)a(-1)) and grassland with high amounts of mineral fertilizer (480 kg N ha(-1) a(-1), calcium ammonium nitrate) or cattle waste (371 kg N*ha(-1) as urine) represent significant sources of nitrous oxide (7,2-15,7 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*)a(-1)). Mowing and moderate N fertilization rates (two cuts and rates up to 120 kg N*ha(-1)) caused only a weak increase in nitrous oxide emission (1,2-5,4 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*a)a(-1)), Reflooding led to an additional strong reduction of nitrous oxide fluxes (0,1-0,8 kg N2O-N*ha(-1*)a(-1)). The considerable temporal and spatial variability of flux rates was obviously induced by complex interactions of many factors and processes like water table, management systems, weather (especially by frost periods), soil degradation, plant growth, C/N transformation, and matter output on the emission rates in fens. However, the disturbed fens represent a significant source of nitrous oxide in Germany.

AB Land use and climate change are driving widespread modifications to the biodiverse and functionally unique headwaters of rivers. In temperate and boreal regions, many headwaters drain peatlands where land management and climate change can cause significant soil erosion and peat deposition in rivers. However, effects of peat deposition in river ecosystems remain poorly understood. We provide two lines of evidence-derived from sediment deposition gradients in experimental mesocosms (0-7.5 g/m(2)) and headwaters (0.82-9.67 g/m(2))-for the adverse impact of peat deposition on invertebrate community biodiversity. We found a consistent negative effect of sediment deposition across both the experiment and survey; at the community level, decreases in density (1956 to 56 individuals per m(2) in headwaters; mean 823 +/- 129 (SE) to 288 +/- 115 individuals per m(2) in mesocosms) and richness (mean 12 +/- 1 to 6 +/- 2 taxa in mesocosms) were observed. Sedimentation increased beta diversity amongst experimental replicates and headwaters, reflecting increasing stochasticity amongst tolerant groups in sedimented habitats. With increasing sedimentation, the density of the most common species, Leuctra inermis, declined from 290 +/- 60 to 70 +/- 30 individuals/m(2) on average in mesocosms and >800 individuals/m(2) to 0 in the field survey. Traits analysis of mesocosm assemblages suggested biodiversity loss was driven by decreasing abundance of invertebrates with trait combinations sensitive to sedimentation (longer life cycles, active aquatic dispersal of larvae, fixed aquatic eggs, shredding feeding habit). Functional diversity metrics reinforced the idea of more stochastic community assembly under higher sedimentation rates. While mesocosm assemblages showed some compositional differences to surveyed headwaters, ecological responses were consistent across these spatial scales. Our results suggest short-term, small-scale stressor experiments can inform understanding of "real-world" peatland river ecosystems. As climate change and land-use change are expected to enhance peatland erosion, significant alterations to invertebrate biodiversity can be expected where these eroded soils are deposited in rivers.

AB Fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured during two to three years at four sites, located within an area of 9 km](2) in southern Sweden, using dark static chamber techniques. Three of the sites were drained coniferous forests on moist organic soils that differed in forest productivity and tree species. The fourth site was an undrained tall sedge mire. Although the drained sites were all moist, with average groundwater levels between 17 and 27 cm below the soil surface, the mean annual dark forest floor CO2 release rate was significantly higher at the drained sites, (0.9-1.9 kg m(-2) y(-1)) than at the undrained mire site (0.8 to 1.2 kg m(-2) y(-1)). CH4 emissions were significantly lower from the drained sites than from the undrained mire (0.0 to 1.6 g m(-2) y(-1), compared to 10.6 to 12.2 g m(-2) y(-1)), while NO emissions were significantly lower from the undrained site than from the drained sites (20 to 30 mg m(-2) y(-1), compared to 30 to 90 mg m(-2) y(-1)). There were no clear effects of site productivity or tree species on the soil fluxes of any of the gases. The annual pet primary production of the forests was modeled. All drained sites were net sinks, while the undrained mire was a net source of greenhouse gases. The estimated net greenhouse gas exchange of the drained sites was correlated with productivity: the most productive site was the largest net sink and the least productive the smallest net sink for greenhouse gases. The results indicate that, to mitigate the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases, drained forest sites, which have been unsuccessfully drained or rewetted due to subsidence, should be managed in a way that keeps the groundwater level at a steady state.

AB Two peatlands, a fen and a bog in southern Finland, were studied for peat and carbon accumulation rates, chemical and physical properties of the peat pro. le, and past vegetation, to assess what stage of succession these peatlands were at the time of human impacts, drainage and restoration. Paludification started at both sites soon after the glacial retreat around 9000 radiocarbon years BP. Peat accumulated at the fen site at an average rate of 0.28 mm yr(-1) (range 0.16-0.58 mm yr(-1)) during development. The peat was composed mostly of Carex with remains of Pinus sylvestris and Betula spp. The bog site had an average accumulation rate of 0.47 mm yr(-1) (range 0.25-1.19 mm yr(-1)), and a minerotrophic sedge stage of about 2000 years in its early development, after which the peat was composed mostly of Sphagna. The long-term rates of carbon accumulation (LORCA) varied from 6.6 to 15.3 g m(-2) yr(-1) (average 11.1 g m(-2) yr(-1)) for the fen and from 6.1 to 21.1 g m(-2) yr(-1) (average 13.2 g m(-2) yr(-1)) for the bog. The main trend in peat chemistry of both mires was the change from higher to lower nutrient levels with an increased acidity towards the surface peat. The main changes in peat chemistry occurred between 4600 and 4200 BP, simultaneously with the spread of Picea abies in the area. This period was preceded by a large-scale climatic change at the boundary between Atlantic and Subboreal chronozones. Drainage during the twentieth century caused compaction in the uppermost peat of the fen, whereas evidence of drainage was hardly noticeable in the bog stratigraphy.

AB The study involves a palaeoecological model for both the coals and associated sediments of the Lampertice Member of the Zacler Formation in the Intra-Sudetic Basin, Czech Republic is proposed. The study area was an intramontane valley drained by a braided to low-sinuosity meandering river with a well developed floodplain. The river probably flowed to the northeast. Taphonomic analysis of the fossil record of various lithologies revealed the existence of autochthonous, parautochthonous-autochthonous and allochthonous plant associations. These associations served as the basis for the restoration of the original phytocoenoses colonizing different areas of the valley: (1) channel banks dominated by pteridosperms with subdominant calamiteans and ferns: (2) clastic floodplains colonised either by pteridosperms, ferns and calamiteans in well-drained areas or by arborescent lycopsids and ferns in poorly-drained areas: (3) mire (peat-forming) forests composed of arborescent lycopsids, ferns and sphenophylls: and (4) valley margin and slopes dominated by cordaiteans and pteridosperms.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate how the biomass of extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia (EMM) is influenced by the addition of different phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and PK fertilizers in peatland forests with variable P and K availability. Four fertilizers were used: apatite, biotite, Rauta-PK (TM) (apatite and ferrosulphate) and a test fertilizer (50% apatite and 50% recycled iron phosphate). Forest plots with four different types of nutrient balance (deficient P and deficient K, deficient P and sufficient K, sufficient P and deficient K, and sufficient P and sufficient K) were studied. The effects on EMM biomass and ectomycorrhizal (EM) biomass in roots were estimated by ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis using in-growth mesh bags. Nutrients and rare-earth elements in EM roots surrounding the mesh bags were quantified and used as indicators of nutrient transport by the EMM in the mesh bags. The biomass of EMM was enhanced by P, K and PK deficiency of the trees, and EM fungal biomass in the roots was increased by P deficiency. The test fertilizer enhanced EMM biomass in all the plots studied, whereas the other fertilizers did not have any significant effect. No significant interactions between the P and K availability of host and mycelial fertilizer response could be detected. Deficiency of P or K or both in needles did not affect the concentrations of rare-earth elements in the tree roots. Earlier results from laboratory experiments have shown reduced carbon allocation to EM fungi under K deficiency, but this was not the case in these mature forests. Instead, we observed increased EMM biomass in response to both P and K deficiency.

AB Peat moss is the most used soilless substrate in the production of container plants in floriculture. Nevertheless, the drainage of peat bogs due to the peat extraction has increased the necessity of seeking products that could replace the peat that is used in plant production. Therefore, a comparative study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a biochar (B) - vermicompost (V) mixture, as a partial substitute for peat-based substrates, on the morpho-physiological characteristics of ornamental plants. Different blends containing B and V were compared to a baseline peat-based substrate (S) as control in the cultivation of two ornamental bedding plant species that are widely used in urban areas: geranium (Pelargonium peltatum) and petunia (Petunia hybrida). Plant growth and physiological parameters were assessed. Results showed that it is possible to grow container plants of these two species with commercial quality, using a peat-based substrate mixed with biochar and/or vermicompost (up to 30% V and 12% B). Plants in these substrates showed a similar or enhanced physiological response to those grown in the control using commercial peat-based substrate.

AB Wetlands perform functions that support the generation of ecologically, socially and economically important values. European legislation has increasingly recognised the importance of preserving wetland ecosystems. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) embodies many of the existing directives that have implications for wetlands. The EU funded EVALUWET project (European valuation and assessment tool supporting wetland ecosystem legislation) aims to develop and implement an operational wetland evaluation decision support system to support European policy objectives. A multidisciplinary approach is adopted combining expertise from natural and social scientists.
   The region of Noord-Hollands Midden is selected as the Dutch case study within EVALUWET. This region north of Amsterdam is a typical Dutch landscape with drained peat meadows in polders below sea level. Important stakeholders are: agricultural organisations, recreation, nature conservation organisations, and provincial/regional authorities. Water levels are controlled in the area. Changes in water regimes are proposed (National Policies, WFD) which will have an impact on the performance of functions such as agriculture, nature and residential and recreation opportunities. In this case study, three alternatives will be compared: (1) modern peat pasture (current), (2) historical peat pasture and (3) dynamic mire.
   Impacts of these alternatives on a number of criteria relevant to EU policy are assessed. Spatial evaluation techniques in combination with multicriteria methods are used to support evaluation.

AB Land-use is a major driver of global biodiversity loss. Despite much evidence of land-use impacts on freshwater biodiversity, long-term changes to groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and their post-disturbance recovery, remain largely milmown. We examined long-term changes of bryophyte communities in 34 boreal springs from 1987 to 2015. In 1987, all the study springs were in near-pristine condition, but 29 of them were disturbed by peatland drainage in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Five sites retained their natural status throughout the study and were used as reference sites. We aimed to assess whether bryophyte vegetation, particularly spring specialist bryophytes, showed gradual recovery toward near-pristine conditions or whether the drainage-induced habitat degradation had caused delayed extinctions of specialists, leading to dominance by generalist taxa. Bryophyte diversity showed no signs of recovery about 20 years since the initial disturbance. In disturbed springs, the abundance of specialists first decreased, then remained relatively stable. Specialist richness decreased steadily and their community composition shifted gradually from the pre-disturbance state. Abundance of habitat generalists did not change but generalist richness also decreased with a time lag. At the same time, both groups remained unaltered in undisturbed springs. We conclude that without restoration measures that improve groundwater hydrology the self-recovery potential of springs is very low. As little is currently known about the effectiveness of spring restoration in halting spring biodiversity loss, the safest management strategy is to refrain from land use within broad buffers around springs.

AB Subfossil bog oak material is an important palaeo-climate and hydrology proxy for the Holocene. A correct interpretation of the subfossil material in terms of growth and population dynamics requires understanding of the underlying processes. The catastrophic rewetting after dyke-failure of a drained peatland forest in NE-Germany provides a unique natural laboratory to calibrate bog oak growth pattern with a known event. Growth differences among groups of currently vital, damaged and dead oaks in the years before the flooding were used to estimate the adaptation potential in dependence on age, tree-size, competition class and groundwater table. Dendrochronological analysis of growth patterns and wood-anatomical parameters revealed changes in the wood in reaction to sharp hydrological shifts (drainage and rewetting). Group specific chronologies were contrasted against instrumental data to evaluate the influence of climate and hydrology on radial growth of oak. Groundwater table proved to be the overriding factor influencing oak growth at our site, already during times of intensive drainage. Results show an influence of micro-site conditions (elevation above soil-water level) along with a higher chance for slower growing and possibly former suppressed trees to survive the catastrophic rewetting. These trees display a typical ring-pattern with four to five years of depressed growth and a subsequent recovery, characterised by a significant increase in ring-width, especially in the earlywood. Trees that died or were damaged following the rewetting typically show strongly reduced latewood-width before they gradually die-off. Our findings are discussed with regard to the interpretation of subfossil bog oak material and a modified version of release detection analysis is proposed as a tool to sharpen the identification of hydrological shifts in bog oak material. The results of the study can contribute to a better understanding of ecophysiological mechanisms underlying growth reactions (and adaptation potential) of oaks to prevailing high water levels.

AB Lesotho is a landlocked country located in the south-eastern interior of South Africa. It is mountainous, with altitudes ranging from 1388 to 3482 m a.s.l. This article focuses mostly on mires occurring above 2750 m a.s.l. in the alpine region of Lesotho, that are characteristically devoid of trees due to the high altitude. Mountain mires in Lesotho are usually fed by groundwater and intermittent runoff from adjacent slopes. Few of them are in near-pristine condition and most have been severely degraded. Erosion has enhanced the drainage and desiccation of peat resulting in combustion of peat layers at several sites. The main threats to the mires include overgrazing and trampling by domestic animals on communal land, increased development as a result of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, and diamond prospecting and mining. Attempts at rehabilitation have met with varying degree of success.

AB Peatlands after drainage and extraction are large sources of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. Restoration, through re-wetting and revegetation, aims to return the C sink function by re-establishing conditions similar to that of an undrained peatland. However, the time needed to re-establish C sequestration is not well constrained due to the lack of multi-year measurements. We measured over 3 years the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), methane (FCH4), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at a restored post-extraction peatland (RES) in southeast Canada (restored 14 years prior to the start of the study) and compared our observations to the C balance of an intact reference peatland (REF) that has a long-term continuous flux record and is in the same climate zone. Small but significant differences in winter respiration driven by temperature were mainly responsible for differences in cumulative NEE between years. Low growing season inter-annual variability was linked to constancy of the initial spring water table position, controlled by the blocked drainage ditches and the presence of water storage structures (bunds and pools). Half-hour FCH4 at RES was small except when Typha latifolia-invaded drainage ditches were in the tower footprint; this effect at the ecosystem level was small as ditches represent a minor fraction of RES. The restored peatland was an annual sink for CO2 (-90 +/- 18 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a source of CH4 (4.4 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and a source of DOC (6.9 +/- 2.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)), resulting in mean net ecosystem uptake of 78 +/- 17 g C m(-2) year(-1). Annual NEE at RES was most similar to wetter, more productive years at REF. Integrating structures to increase water retention, alongside re-establishing key species, have been effective at re-establishing the net C sink rate to that of an intact peatland.

AB In this study we investigated the role of intensive and extensive dairy farm practices on CO2 exchange and the carbon balance of peatlands by means of eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Year long EC measurements were made in two adjacent farm sites on peat soil in the western part of the Netherlands. One site (Stein) is a new meadow bird reserve and is managed predominantly by mowing in June and August. The second site (Oukoop) is an intensive dairy farm. Maximum photosynthetic uptake of the grass sward (range 2 to 34 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) showed a close and similar linear relationship with Leaf Area Index (LAI; range 1 to 5) except in maturing hay meadows, where maximum photosynthetic uptake did not increase further. Apparent quantum yield varied between 0.02 and 0.08 (mean 0.045) mu mol CO2 mu mol(-1) photons at both sites and was significantly correlated with LAI during the growth season. Ecosystem Respiration at 10 degrees C (R-10) calculated from the year round data set was 3.35 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at Stein and 3.69 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at Oukoop. Both sites were a source of carbon in winter and a sink during summer with net ecosystem exchange varying between 50 to 100 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in winter to below -400 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in summer. Periodically, both sites became a source after mowing. Net annual ecosystem exchange (NEE) for Stein was -5.7 g C m(-2) a(-1) and for Oukoop 133.9 g C m(-2) a(-1). When biomass removal, manure applications and estimates of methane emissions ware taken into account, both eutrophic peat meadows are a strong source for C around 420 g C m(-2) a(-1).

AB Lake Hula and its neighbouring peatland in the upper Galilee, Israel were drained during the 1950s. For about 40 years after drainage most of the area was under continuous intensive cultivation with rain-fed winter crops and irrigated summer crops. In 1994 an area of about 110 ha of mainly peat soil was re-flooded and 350 ha surrounding it were partly taken out of intensive agricultural use. The surrounding area was still cultivated under rain-fed conditions in the cool winter season, but left fallow during the hot, dry summer. The summer vegetation was mowed periodically to promote the development of a continuous sward cover for recreation and control of wind erosion. The goal of this research was to study the relationship between dynamic changes in the soil and water conditions and the composition and species distribution of the spontaneous summer vegetation. During four consecutive years the vegetation dynamics were characterised by increasing dominance of Cynodon dactylon and Sorghum halepense. Cyperus rotundus, which was common under irrigated cultivation, partly disappeared under the new non-irrigated regime. The density and growth rate of the vegetation mainly reflected differences in the water table depth, which varied between 0.5 m and 3 m. Three years after re-flooding, soil salinity was high in areas where the water table was higher than 0.5 m and in dry patches where almost no cover of vegetation was found. In these sites the concentration of mineral nitrogen (N-NO3 and/or N-NH4) was especially high. A continuous vegetation cover developed on the peat soil in areas where the depth of the water table was between 1 m and 2 m. Mowing the vegetation periodically in summer suppressed the growth of tall, weedy species and promoted the dominance of Cynodon dactylon creating a dense, productive sward.

AB 1. Peatlands have suffered great losses following drainage for agriculture, forestry, urbanisation, or peat mining, near inhabited areas. We evaluated the faunal and vegetation patterns after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod occurrence patterns.
   2. Both avian species richness and peatland vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration. Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs, Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also differed between man-made and natural pools.
   3. Amphibian tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools. Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups.
   4. We conclude that our restoration efforts were partially successful. Peatland-wide vegetation patterns following restoration mimicked those of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for man-made pools to fully emulate the characteristics of natural bog pools.

AB This study focuses on the distribution of major anions and inorganic N species after the installation of a subsurface drainage system in loamy clay soils overlaying paleo-marsh peats and paleo-channel sediments. An agricultural field of 6 ha was chosen as the experimental site. Its stratigraphy was reconstructed thanks to a high resolution core sampling in 13 boreholes. In the lower undisturbed portion of the soil profile a large vertical and horizontal heterogeneity for nitrate and ammonium content was noticed, mainly due to the type of sediment underling the cultivated layer. On the contrary, the upper portion of the soil profile (0.5-0.6 m) displayed a homogeneous texture, organic matter content and permeability, most likely induced by tillage. The presence of the subsurface drainage system, reduces soil salinity and avoids soil waterlogged conditions guaranteeing an oxic/suboxic environment, where nitrate is the dominant N species. Underneath the subsurface drainage system, the elevated ammonium, chloride and bromide concentrations are directly related to the presence of non-drained peaty sediments, suggesting a natural origin of these species. Shallow groundwater samples displayed very similar content of anions with respect to the soils extractions, proving chemical equilibrium conditions between matrix/solution and confirming that advection is not dominant and that, the chemical fluxes are driven by diffusion.
   This paper shows that subsurface drainage systems are effective in ameliorating soil properties even in agricultural field consisting of low permeability materials with naturally high content of organic matter and salinity and that they can induce changes in redox conditions responsible for the large differences in N speciation found in soil profiles.

AB Sedimentation is a pervasive environmental pressure affecting rivers globally. Headwaters draining catchments rich in organic soils (i.e., peat) are particularly vulnerable to enhanced sedimentation caused by land management and environmental change, yet many of the ecological consequences of peat deposition are poorly understood. We conducted a before-after-control-impact experiment in two rivers draining blanket peatland in Northern England to test the effect of sediment inputs on water quality, macroinvertebrate drift, macroinvertebrate community structure, and ecosystem metabolism. Sediment addition increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, total oxidised nitrogen and suspended sediment concentration in rivers, and intensified the total drift of macroinvertebrates particularly at night. By contrast, the abundance and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates were unaffected, except for declines in Coleoptera abundance in one river. The gross primary production of both rivers was strongly suppressed as the benthos was smothered by sediment. Community respiration also declined, albeit by different extents in the two rivers. Our experiment revealed that short-term pulses of organic sediment in rivers can have broad effects on water quality and biota, from influences on the dispersal of individual organisms to the modification of ecosystem processes. Organic sediments therefore warrant further examination, to include longer observation periods and more sites. It is particularly important to clarify the extent to which impacts extend from peatland streams into larger rivers downstream. Such studies are necessary to inform global management efforts to restore the integrity of river ecosystems under a range of water and biodiversity policy mechanisms.

AB Question: How does restoration affect the hydrology and the understorey vegetation of managed pine fens?
   Location: Oligotrophic pine fens in Natura 2000 areas in Kainuu, eastern Finland.
   Methods: Eleven managed pine fens and eight pristine reference pine fens were chosen for the study in 2005. The managed fens, which had been drained for forestry during the 1970s and 1980s, were restored in 2007. The water table was monitored in all fens over four growing seasons during 2006 to 2009, and vegetation was surveyed from permanent sample plots in 2006 and 2009.
   Results: Before restoration in 2006, the water table was at a significantly lower level in the managed fens compared with the pristine fens. Immediately after restoration, the water table rose to the same level as in the pristine fens, and this change was permanent. Forest drainage had had little impact on the understorey vegetation of the managed fens in the three decades before restoration, with species typical of pristine fens still dominating the sites. Forest dwarf shrubs and feather mosses had started to increase in cover, but mire dwarf shrubs and Sphagnum mosses still dominated the managed fens. Only the typical hollow species Sphagnum majus, Sphagnum balticum and Scheuzeria palustris were missing from the managed fens. Two years after restoration, the changes in species composition were also marginal, with increased cover of mire dwarf shrubs and sedges being the only significant change.
   Conclusions: The success of restoration of oligotrophic pine fens seems likely, given that changes in hydrological functioning occurred rapidly, and since little change has occurred in the vegetation composition after draining. Speeding up the regeneration process in these peatland types by restoration may, therefore, be recommended, especially if the drainage effect extends to nearby pristine mires and influences their biodiversity.

AB Riverine peatlands are hydrological buffer zones between terrestrial. and aquatic ecosystems. Under natural conditions they fulfil. important ecological functions such as nutrient retention, flood mitigation and conservation of wetland biocoenoses. In Western Europe, most riverine peatlands have lost these functions due to increased drainage and land use intensity. Before starting restoration measures in degenerated areas an analysis of the local hydrological conditions is required to assess potentials for nutrient retention and re-establishment of characteristic biocoenoses. In this study, we carried out such an analysis in a degenerated riverine peatland of Northern Germany (Upper Eider valley). First, we characterized different water pathways according to their nutrient concentrations. The evaluation revealed three important pathways: (a) water of springs with high nitrate concentrations (medians between 4 and 21 mg l(-1) NO3-N) and both low ammonium and ortho-phosphate concentrations; (b) water of springs with tow nitrate concentrations; and (c) water of peat drains with tow nitrate concentrations but both high ammonium (medians between 0.6 and 1.4mg l(-1) NH4-N) and ortho-phosphate concentrations (medians between 0.07 and 0.17mg l(-1) PO4-P). A hydrochemical screening in two subareas pointed out, that the heavily drained subarea was characterized by a high density of drains and oxic, nitrate-polluted springs near the sandy slopes. In this subarea, potential for nutrient input to the river was higher than in the weakly drained subarea, in which drains were lacking and nitrate entering the peatland by shallow groundwater was denitrified. Spatial heterogeneity of water pathways was high in both subareas. We concluded, that a screening of all pathways is necessary to assess the restoration potentials of degenerated riverine peatlands. In some cases, pathways such as drains or ditches without contact to springs can be characterized in the area without measurements of their nutrient concentrations. In other cases, such measurements are indispensable to distinguish between different springs. However, our results have also shown, that a single measurement is sufficient to characterize also these water pathways. (c) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB We measured methane (CH4) exchange rates with automatic chambers at the forest floor of a nutrient-rich drained peatland in 2011-2013. The fen, located in southern Finland, was drained for forestry in 1969 and the tree stand is now a mixture of Scots pine, Norway spruce, and pubescent birch. Our measurement system consisted of six transparent chambers and stainless steel frames, positioned on a number of different field and moss layer compositions. Gas concentrations were measured with an online cavity ring-down spectroscopy gas analyzer. Fluxes were calculated with both linear and exponential regression. The use of linear regression resulted in systematically smaller CH4 fluxes by 10-45% as compared to exponential regression. However, the use of exponential regression with small fluxes (<2.5 mu gCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) typically resulted in anomalously large absolute fluxes and high hour-to-hour deviations. Therefore, we recommend that fluxes are initially calculated with linear regression to determine the threshold for "low" fluxes and that higher fluxes are then recalculated using exponential regression. The exponential flux was clearly affected by the length of the fitting period when this period was <190 s, but stabilized with longer periods. Thus, we also recommend the use of a fitting period of several minutes to stabilize the results and decrease the flux detection limit. There were clear seasonal dynamics in the CH4 flux: the forest floor acted as a CH4 sink particularly from early summer until the end of the year, while in late winter the flux was very small and fluctuated around zero. However, the magnitude of fluxes was relatively small throughout the year, ranging mainly from -130 to +100 mu gCH(4) m(-2) h(-1). CH4 emission peaks were observed occasionally, mostly in summer during heavy rainfall events. Diurnal variation, showing a lower CH4 uptake rate during the daytime, was observed in all of the chambers, mainly in the summer and late spring, particularly in dry conditions. It was attributed more to changes in wind speed than air or soil temperature, which suggest that physical rather than biological phenomena are responsible for the observed variation. The annual net CH4 exchange varied from -104 +/- 30 to -505 +/- 39 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) among the six chambers, with an average of -219 mg CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) over the 2-year measurement period.

AB Capsule Declines in the breeding populations of Snipe, Lapwing and Curlew were recorded between April and June 1999 and compared with previous estimates in 1987.
   Aims To compare populations of non-coastal breeding waders between 1987 and 1999.
   Methods In 106 2 km x 2 km square tetrads, observers recorded the number of breeding pairs of waders and habitat details on 1 :10 000 scale maps.
   Results A significant decline of c. 60% for Lapwinq and Curlew, and a non-significant decline of 30% for Snipe was recorded over 12 years. Concentrations of these species were found in County Tyrone, but Counties Antrim, Down and Armagh supported few breeding pairs of any species. Very few pairs of any species were recorded on improved grassland despite its widespread availability.
   Conclusion A successful conservation strategy for these species must address the wider countryside and not just key sites. Intensive pastoral forming in upland and lowland areas and activities such as drainage and peat extraction will further reduce the suitability of open habitats for these wader species.

AB In this study, a process-based model was developed for studying the climatic sensitivity of the soil moisture content (theta) in a cutaway peatland cultivated with a perennial crop (Phalaris arundinaceae, L, RCG). The model was parameterized based on the canopy development and the soil properties measured in Linnansuo peatland in Eastern Finland. The model was also calibrated and validated by continuous measurements of meteorology, soil temperature, soil moisture and energy fluxes (eddy covariance system) during a wet year (2009) and a dry year (2010). The results showed that the model captured well the seasonal trend of the latent heat flux during the two-year period. Moreover, the model explained the major seasonal variations of the moisture content in multiple peat layers in the soil profile. Sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the fluctuation of the water table (WT) had little impact on the seasonal dynamics of the peat moisture content in the Linnansuo site. These results indicated that anthropological disturbances, such as peat extraction, drainage and energy crop cultivation, critically weakened the theta-WT interaction in the Linnansuo peatland. Moreover, these changes indicated the high climatic sensitivity of the peat moisture content especially to the variations of the seasonal pattern of precipitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Methane (CH4) emissions from drained organic soils are generally low, but internal gas transport in aerenchymatous plants may result in local emission hotspots. In a paired-sample field study at three different sites we measured fluxes of CH4 with static chambers from adjacent sampling quadrats with and without Juncus effusus during four field campaigns. At all three sites, CH4 was observed in the soil at all sampling depths (5 to 100 cm), and in most cases both above and below the groundwater table. During spring, local maxima suggested methanogenesis also took place above the water table at all three sites. We found significant CH4 emissions at all three sites, but emission controls were clearly different. Across the three sites, average emission rates (+/- 1 SE) for sampling quadrats with and without J. effusus were 1.47 +/- 0.28 and 1.37 +/- 0.33 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), respectively, with no overall effect of J. effusus on CH4 emissions. However, a significant effect of J. effusus was seen at one of the three sites. At this site, local CH4 maxima were closer to the soil surface than at the other sites, and the upper soil layers were dryer. This could have affected both root CH4 accessibility and CH4 oxidation respectively, and together with limited gas diffusivity in the soil column, cause elevated CH4 emissions from J. effusus. We conclude that J. effusus has the potential to act as point sources of CH4 from drained peatlands, but more studies on the specific conditions under which there is an effect, are needed before the results can be used in modelling of CH4 emissions.

AB The amount and nutrient content of the above-ground litterfall was followed for 9 years in an unfertilized, PKMgB and NPKMgB fertilized Scots pine stand growing on a drained ombrotrophic bog in eastern Finland. The annual litterfall on unfertilized plots was 1995 kg ha(-1), of which needles accounted for 74%. The effective temperature sum (threshold value + 5 degrees C) explained 99% of the annual variation in the amount of needle litterfall when the data from one atypical year were excluded from the analysis. Nutrient concentrations were, except for Fe, higher in needle litter than in the other litterfall fractions. Nitrogen, P and K concentrations were low in autumn, and those of Ca and Mn high, possibly owing to variation in the mobility of elements during senescence. The annual litterfall input of N to the soil was 12.4 kg ha(-1), and the corresponding values for P and K were 0.08 kg ha(-1) and 1.81 kg ha(-1), respectively. Fertilization reduced needle litterfall in the first year after treatment, but had no effect thereafter. The amount of other litterfall fractions was not affected by fertilization in any of the 9 years of the study. Nitrogen, P, K and B concentrations increased in the needle litter after both fertilization treatments. The results indicate long-term cycling of fertilizer nutrients on the site.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations and evasion rates were measured in surface waters draining Mer Bleue peatland (Ontario, Canada) between spring and autumn 2005. All sites exhibit a consistent pattern of supersaturation throughout the year, which is broadly related to hydrological and temperature changes between spring snowmelt and autumn freezing. Both measurements and estimates of CO2 and CH4 evasion from open water to the atmosphere suggest that parts of the catchment (including beaver dams) are significant degassing hot spots. We present data showing how vertical gaseous carbon fluxes compare with lateral carbon fluxes and make an initial estimate of the importance to the overall carbon budget of CO2 and CH4 evasion to the atmosphere from water surfaces at Mer Bleue.

AB Drainage and cultivation of peat soils almost always result in rapid soil degradation and a loss of soil organic matter (SOM). Winter cover crop cultivation and subsequent incorporation and watertable elevation have been considered as potential strategies to improve soil quality and decrease nutrient loss in drained and cultivated peatlands. However, the combined effect of residue incorporation and watertable management on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in these highly productive fen peat soils remains unknown. In the present study, two winter cover crops with contrasting carbon/nitrogen ratios (vetch [Vicia sativa], 45-60; rye [Secale cereale], 13-14) were incorporated into peat soils as green manure (without extra synthetic/organic N addition) at two watertable depths (-50 and -30 cm). Our results showed that fast mineralization of incorporated residues can cause a large pulse of GHG release under favourable environmental conditions. Both vetch and rye incorporation increased CO2 emissions compared with the bare soil treatments due to labile C addition and removal of N constraints. However, the two cover crops had strongly contrasting effects on N2O emissions. Incorporation of low C/N ratio vetch stimulated N2O emissions (average 21.8 +/- 7.3 mg N m(-2) hr(-1)) compared with the bare soil treatments, whereas high C/N ratio rye decreased N2O emissions (average 0.09 +/- 0.03 mg N m(-2) hr(-1)). Raising the watertable slightly reduced CO2 emissions from an average of 1.3 +/- 0.4 (the bare soils) to 0.9 +/- 0.3 g C m(-2) hr(-1) by inhibiting SOM mineralization but significantly increased N2O emissions in the vetch treatments by stimulating denitrification. CH4 fluxes were not affected by watertable depth, and their contribution to total global warming potential was negligible. Therefore, we conclude that high C/N ratio cover crops (e.g., rye) in combination with a raised watertable may represent a viable management option to mitigate GHG fluxes in fen peat soils.

AB More than eighty years of mining at the Novo-Ursk Au-bearing sulfide field (Kemerovo region, Russia) have produced a mixed natural-industrial system "wastes-gold-bearing acid mine drainage (AMD) waters-peat". The behavior of Au, Ag and related elements in the system "wastes-AMD" is described in Part 1 of our study (Myagkaya et al. 2016) where we discuss interaction between the gold-bearing mine drainage waters and peat. This interaction leads to rapid accumulation of Ca, Fe, Mn, Ba, Cu, Zn, Se, Au, Ag, Hg, Pb to concentrations exceeding those in cyanidation wastes (especially, Cu, Zn, Se, Hg, and Pb). The contents of Au (about 5 ppm on average, locally as high as 155 ppm) and Ag (average about 11.2 ppm, locally up to 560 ppm) in peat are above the lowest economic values. These results provide clues to technologies for both generation of secondary gold (silver) deposits at existing or planned tailings and immobilization of toxic elements.
   Gold is accumulated in peat by a series of processes (reduction of ion gold to elemental form, sorption by complexation, biochemical reactions, etc.). This secondary gold is mostly chemically bound and invisible and a minor part is nanoparticulate (from tens of nm to 1.5-4 mu m particles; with 7.5-53 parts per thousand Cu); it coexists with barite, secondary pyrite, tiemannite, Hg and Zn sulfides. Silver becomes redeposited in peat as silver-bearing sulfides and selenides. The presence of fossil bacterial fragments points to microbially mediated physicochemical processes leading to sulfide and gold mineralization by sulfate reduction and biosorption. Formation of abundant gold and mercury minerals may be due primarily to microbial activity.
   Peat in the area of the Ursk tailings is actually a prototype of coalbeds. Therefore, the mineralogical and geochemical patterns of gold and silver reprecipitation on organic matter, and the respective Au and Ag enrichment, provide insights into the early history of gold mineralization in coal.

AB [1] We report on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measurements conducted with the eddy covariance method over agricultural peat soil in the 2-year period between October 2000 and October 2002. In 2001, spring barley and undersown grass were sown on the site. After the barley harvest, the perennial forage grass was left to grow, so that in 2002 the field was growing grass. A higher maximum net CO2 uptake was observed for barley than for grass during the height of the summer, peaking at about -1.0 and - 0.75 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. The maximum nighttime total ecosystem respiration was measured in July and was similar for both crops, about 0.35 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). During the growing season the field acted as a daily CO2 sink for only 40 days in barley versus 84 days in grass. In the winter the average carbon dioxide efflux varied from 15.6 to 16.5 mug CO2 m(-2) s(-1). The annual NEE of the agricultural peat soil growing barley and grass was 771 +/- 104 and 290 +/- 91 g CO2 m(-2), respectively. The longer net CO2 uptake period was the main reason for the lower annual NEE for grass; however, owing to the higher amount of grass biomass produced the net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated as the sum of NEE and removed biomass, was slightly larger for grass (452 g C m(-2)) than for barley (336 g C m(-2)). These results show that the organic peat is still undergoing rapid decomposition after more than 100 years of cultivation activity. In addition, switching from an annual to a perennial crop did not turn the field into a CO2 sink, at least during a 1-year period.

AB We studied methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (Hg-T) in impounded and natural surface waters in northwestern Minnesota, in settings ranging from agricultural to undeveloped. In a recently constructed (1995) permanent-pool impoundment, MeHg levels typically increased from inflow to outflow during 1997; this trend broke down from late 1998 to early 1999. MeHg levels in the outflow reached seasonal maxima in mid-summer (maximum of 1.0 ng L-1 in July 1997) and late-winter (maximum of 6.6 ng L-1 in February 1999), and are comparable to high levels observed in new hydroelectric reservoirs in Canada. Spring and autumn MeHg levels were typically about 0.1-0.2 ng L-1. Overall, MeHg levels in both the inflow (a ditch that drains peatlands) and outflow were significantly higher than in three nearby reference natural lakes. Eleven older permanent-pool impoundments and six natural lakes in northwestern Minnesota were sampled five times. The impoundments typically had higher MeHg levels (0.071-8.36 ng L-1) than natural lakes. Five of six lakes MeHg levels typical of uncontaminated lakes (0.014-1.04 ng L-1) with highest levels in late winter, whereas a hypereutrophic lake had high levels (0.37-3.67 ng L-1) with highest levels in mid-summer. Seven temporary-pool impoundments were sampled during summer high-flow events. Temporary-pool impoundments that retained water for about 10-15 days after innundation yielded pronounced increases in MeHg from inflow to outflow, in one case reaching 4.6 ng L-1, which was about 2 ng L-1 greater than the mean inflow concentration during the runoff event.

TI Late Holocene coastal-plain evolution of the Netherlands: the role of

AB This paper demonstrates the decisive role of natural preconditions on the formation of large late Holocene sea ingressions in peaty coastal plains along the North Sea's southern shores. Geological and archaeological evidence shows that these sea ingressions (expansion of new tidal systems) were mainly caused by land subsidence, which occurred due to intensified agricultural use of artificially drained peatlands since the Late Iron Age (250-12 BC). This made the coastal plain sensitive to storm-surge ingression through weak spots, e.g., at the location of existing creeks, in the coastline.
   Using The Netherlands as a case study, we show that natural preconditions (i.e., the geological setting at the time of ingression) played a key role in the pacing and extent of tidal area expansion. Ingressive tidal systems eventually reached most far inland in coastal segments with wide peaty back-barrier plains. In contrast, sea ingression formation was hampered in coastal segments with well-developed natural ingression-protecting geomorphic features (e.g., beach-barriers, supratidal levees). Feedback mechanisms, such as additional peat subsidence by loading of sediment imported into the new tidal area, caused further tidal volume increase and created accommodation space for tidal deposits. These combined effects caused irreversible sea ingression over large areas that consequently became unsuitable for habitation for many centuries.
   Improved understanding of such sea-ingression mechanisms and their facilitating conditions are essential for the assessment of the sensitivity of many densely populated coastal plains, which experience major human-induced subsidence, eventually leading to coastal plain drowning.

AB This paper represents the first continuous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) record, measured in a stream draining an Atlantic blanket bog in South West Ireland for the calendar year 2007. At 30-min intervals, the DOC concentration was automatically measured using an in-stream spectroanalyser whose variation compared well with laboratory analysed samples taken by a 24-bottle auto-sampler. The concentration of DOC ranged from 2.7 to 11.5 mg L(-1) with higher values during the summer and lower values during the winter. A simple linear regression model of DOC concentration versus air temperature of the previous day was found, suggesting that temperature more than discharge was controlling the DOC concentration in the stream. The change in DOC concentration with storm events showed two patterns: (1) in the colder period: the DOC concentration seemed to be independent of changes in stream flow; (2) in the warmer period: the DOC concentration was found to rise with increases in stream flow on some occasions and to decrease with increasing stream flow on other occasions. The annual export of DOC for 2007 was 14.1 (+/- 1.5) g C m(-2). This value was calculated using stream discharge data that were determined by continuously recorded measurements of stream height. The flux of DOC calculated with the 30-min sampling was compared with that calculated based on lower sampling frequencies. We found that sampling frequency of weekly or monthly were adequate to calculate the annual flux of DOC in our study site in 2007.

AB We used national scenario analyses to examine the effects of fertilization, use of improved regeneration material and ditch network maintenance (DNM), both separately and simultaneously, on timber production of Finnish forests under the current climate. We also analyzed how the area of artificial regeneration, forest fertilization, and DNM developed in different management and harvesting intensity scenarios. The initial data were obtained from the 11th National Forest Inventory of Finland, excluding protected forests. Four sets of even-flow harvesting scenarios with annual timber harvest targets of 60, 70, 80, and 90 million m(3) were developed for 90-year simulation period. Use of improved material in artificial forest regeneration was assumed to result in 10% higher diameter and height increment compared to naturally regenerated seedlings. Sub-xeric pine-dominated and mesic spruce-dominated sites were fertilized, and 40% of drained peatlands were maintenance-ditched when they fulfilled a set of predetermined criteria for temperature sum, stand basal area, and mean tree diameter. As a result, when fertilization, improved regeneration material, and DNM were all used, the mean annual volume increment over the 90-year simulation period increased by 3.4-5.4 million m(3) depending on harvesting intensity. The maximum sustainable harvest of timber would be almost 80 million m(3) yr(-1). The simulated fertilization area was about four times larger than the presently fertilized area, and the simulated DNM area was about the same as the current. Fertilization gave the largest additional 90-year volume increment and the DNM the smallest when they were used separately. The use of improved regeneration material gave the largest additional volume increment in southern Finland and fertilization in central and northern Finland.

AB 1. Simulation of climate change (summer drought) stimulated autotrophy in a stream draining a Welsh peatland. Biofilm autotrophic biomass (chlorophyll) increased by 145% and was correlated with an increased overall metabolic activity (r = 0.75, P < 0.05). Bacterial population densities were not significantly affected.
   2. The increased autotrophy was probably related to a decrease in the organic:inorganic ratio of nutrients released from the wetland to the stream.
   3. Bacterial reserves of poly-beta-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) fell by 51%. Increased nitrate concentrations were inversely correlated with autotrophic diversity (r = -0.88, P < 0.001).
   4. The increased autotrophic biomass represents an increased nutrient supply for the higher trophic levels which could promote higher productivity within the stream ecosystem as a whole.
   5. The simulation also caused a cooler (11%, P < 0.01) streamflow from the drought-impacted wetland, which could mitigate against any adverse temperature-dependent effects of future climatic change.

AB Denitrification is an important process in the nitrogen (N) balance of intensively managed grassland, especially on poorly drained peat soils. Aim of this study was to quantify the N loss through denitrification in the top and sub soil of grassland on peat soils. Sampling took place at 2 sites with both control (0 N) and N fertilised (+ N) treatments. Main difference between the sites was the ground water level. Denitrification was measured on a weekly basis for 2 years with a soil core incubation technique using acetylene (C2H2) inhibition. Soil cores were taken from the top soil (0-20 cm depth) and the sub soil (20-40 cm depth) and incubated in containers or 24 hours. The denitrification rate was calculated from the nitrous oxide production between 4 and 24 hours of incubation. Denitrification capacities of the soils and the soil layers were also determined.
   The top soil was the major layer for denitrification with losses ranging from 9 to 26 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) from the 0 N treatment. Losses from the top soil of the + N treatment ranged from 13 to 49 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The sub soil contributed, on average, 20% of the total denitrification losses from the 0-40 layer. Losses from the 0-40 cm layer were 2 times higher on the +N treatment than on the 0 N treatment and totalled up to 70 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Significant correlation coefficients were found between denitrification activity on the one hand, and ground water level, water filled pore space and nitrate content on the other, in the top soil but not in the sub soil. The denitrification capacity experiment showed that the availability of easily decomposable organic carbon was an important limiting factor for the denitrification activity in the sub soil of these pear soils.

AB A large wetland drainage project was initiated in 1912 near the town of Seney, Michigan, U.S.A. This project included the construction of a series of ditches through a large peatland to drain the land for agricultural use. The largest of these ditches was the 35 km long Walsh Ditch. Much of the drained wetland affected by the Walsh Ditch is now managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of Seney National Wildlife Refuge. Between 2002-2003, nine large earthen ditch plugs were installed along a 4.5 km section of the ditch in an attempt to restore the hydrological and ecological integrity of the approximately 1400 ha of wetlands and streams. This study explores the effects that the ditch plugs had on the hydrology and vegetation structure of the adjacent landscape 8y later. Plot level measurements (707 m(2) plots) of hydrology and vegetation, combined with an analysis of land cover change using aerial imagery, indicated that the ditch plugs had been successful in altering the hydrology and vegetation over portions of the area. Mortality of upland tree species more typical of xeric conditions and colonization by typical wetland species indicated that these sites should continue to develop into wetland ecosystems. Land cover change analysis showed an increase in wetland area of 152 ha. The areas of change were concentrated near the plugged ditch and near a large anthropogenic pool.

AB Upland ecosystems are recognized for their importance in providing valuable ecosystem services including water storage, water supply and flood attenuation alongside carbon storage and biodiversity. The UK contains 10-15% of the global resource of upland blanket peatlands, the hydrology and ecology of which are highly sensitive to external anthropogenic and climatic forcing. In particular, drainage of these landscapes for agricultural intensification and peat extraction has resulted in often unquantified damage to the peatland hydrology, and little is understood about the spatially distributed impacts of these practices on near-surface wetness. This paper develops new techniques to extract spatial data describing the near-surface wetness and hydrological behaviour of drained blanket peatlands using airborne thermal imaging data and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The relative thermal emissivity (?(r)) of the ground surface is mapped and used as a proxy for near-surface wetness. The results show how moorland drainage and land surface structure have an impact on airborne measurements of thermal emissivity. Specifically, we show that information on land surface structure derived from LiDAR can help normalize signals in thermal emissivity data to improve description of hydrological condition across a test catchment in Exmoor, UK. An in situ field hydrological survey was used to validate these findings. We discuss how such data could be used to describe the spatially distributed nature of near-surface water resources, to optimize catchment management schemes and to deliver improved understanding of the drivers of hydrological change in analogous ecosystems.

AB This study was focussed on regeneration of Norway spruce (Picea abies)-dominated forests on fertile, drained peatlands located along a north-south gradient in Sweden. Naturally established seedlings of mainly spruce and pubescent birch were inventoried with respect to numbers and height, and planted (large, bare-root) spruce seedlings in 10-year-old shelterwoods and clearcuts with respect to survival, damage and height development. Two shelterwood densities were studied, 140 and 200 trees ha(-1). The planting treatment also included site preparation (mounding in shelterwoods, mounding and no mounding in clearcuts). The planted seedlings and the natural regeneration were inventoried 9 and 11 growing seasons after cut, respectively.
   Large numbers of naturally established spruce and birch (Betula sp.) seedlings were obtained without soil preparation in the shelterwoods. The height development of these spruce seedlings was, however, much slower than that of the planted shelterwood seedlings, indicating 2-3 times longer regeneration period (up to 20 years) for the natural regeneration alternative. In the clearcuts, only birch seedlings established naturally. In all the study areas, planting in mounds was equally or more successful (survival, height, damage) in shelterwoods than in clearcuts. Planting without mounding in the clearcuts was nor successful (low survival rate and height, extensive damage). In general, the number of naturally established seedlings in shelterwoods, and the survival rate of planted seedlings in clearcuts and shelterwoods, were much lower in the study areas in central Sweden than in the areas in the north and south. The results from the study suggest that shelterwood methods (by natural establishment or planting) used in highly productive spruce forests yield acceptable or desirable levels of regeneration.

AB Suspended sediments have a clear impact on fluvial water quality and aquatic habitats. As the concentrations are highly variable, continuous measurement offers a good way to provide accurate and precise values of sediment concentration and yield. However, there is a lack of information regarding the effect of organic peat particles, which typically appear in boreal fluvial systems. In the present study, the effect of different types of suspended sediments on calibration of a turbidity meter and an acoustic Doppler velocimetry (Triton-ADV) was studied in laboratory conditions. The measurements were performed using particulate organic peat, clay and silt with several concentrations ranging from clear water to 3500 mg L(-1). The present study primarily provides organic peat sediment calibration data for used sensors. Regression equations were developed for the different sediment. The results indicate that particle size, shape, concentration and sediment type have an effect on calibration. When the turbidity and the ADV calibration were performed for different particle size groups, sediment types and concentrations, the calibration and suspended solids calculation error was reduced. For the turbidity sensor used, the reliable upper continuous measurement limit for clay, peat and silt sediments was found to be at 1000, 2500 and 3500 mg L(-1), respectively. The ADV-sensor was noticed to be reliable only with fine particles. The results enable easy and first step calibration and error assessment for automatic turbidity and acoustic monitoring of the suspended sediment quality typically present in headwater fluvial systems. This study can be used to evaluate the effect of different sediments on turbidity and ADV-measuring error and reliability during changing particles size distributions, characteristics and concentrations. The laboratory-based approach used in this study indicates that the shape of organic peat particles has an influence on sensor calibration, especially when suspended sediment concentrations are high.

AB 1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Epipactis palustris (L.) Crantz that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation.
   2. Epipactis palustris is native to Britain, being widely distributed throughout England and Wales, but is less common in the north. Although absent from most of Scotland, it occurs as far north as Perthshire. It is widely distributed in Ireland. The species extends throughout most of Europe, occurring as far east as Mongolia and the north of Turkey, but it is absent from the southern Mediterranean region.
   3. Epipactis palustris grows mainly in full sunlight, rarely under shade, and on calcareous, but nutrient-poor, moist to wet substrates. It favours flushed or seasonally inundated areas in which the intensity of competition from other vegetation is low. It is most commonly found in wet dune slacks, calcareous fens and on peat, but it also occurs on sandy substrates overlying heavy clay or loamy soils. Occasionally, it can also be found near the top of slopes in chalk downland.
   4. Epipactis palustris multiplies both by vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction. Vegetative propagation involves the production of regularly branched rhizomes. It flowers in Britain from the end of June until the beginning of September. The flowers produce nectar, which is often colonized by bacteria and to a lesser extent by yeasts. The species is pollinated by a wide range of insects, including honeybees, flies, wasps, beetles, bumblebees and ants, but is also capable of limited spontaneous autogamy. The most efficient pollinators are small bees and solitary wasps. Fruit production is generally high (>80% of the flowers produce capsules).
   5. Epipactis palustris is vulnerable to changes in soil water level and to substrate nutrient enrichment. It has suffered a strong decline in its distribution range in Britain, with most losses of local populations occurring before 1930. Habitat destruction and drainage of marshes and fens appear to be the most common causes for the decline of the species. Restoration of old wet dune slacks by topsoil removal and addition of hay from neighbouring vegetation has been successful in encouraging colonization and establishment of populations of the species within a few years. Cessation of draining of mires may also promote the long-term survival of populations of the species.

AB 1 The recent vegetation dynamics of 16 ombrotrophic mires in southern Quebec (Canada) was studied through palaeoecological (dendrochronology, plant macrofossil and pollen analyses) and historical (aerial photograph analyses) techniques.
   2 Plant macrofossil analyses show that prior to European colonization (c. 1800), mires were predominately open environments dominated by Sphagnum mosses. Many sites subsequently became forested with little or no Sphagnum.
   3 Aerial photograph analyses indicate that widespread forest expansion occurred in all mires between 1948 and 1995. The percentage of the total mire area occupied by forest increased from 22.5 to 56.5%, an overall gain of 137 ha of forest habitat.
   4 A dry climatic period during the first part of the 20th century, drainage resulting from human activities, and fire events, seem to be the main causal factors of vegetation changes.
   5 Forest expansion is expected to cause profound changes in bog ecosystems, such as altering hydrological conditions and organic accumulation processes, and to be detrimental to regional biodiversity and the carbon balance.
   6 Overall, this study highlights the need to incorporate multiple approaches in reconstructing the vegetation dynamics of an ecosystem, and in determining causal factors of vegetation change.

AB To assess the biogeochemical effects of tidal restrictions on salt-marsh sulfur cycling and plant growth, cores of short-form Spartina alterniflora peat were desalinated and kept either waterlogged or drained in greenhouse microcosms, Changes in net Spartina production, and porewater and solid phase chemistry of treated cores were compared to natural conditions in the field collection site over a 21-mo period. Net production among treatments increased significantly in drained and waterlogged peat compared to field conditions during the first growing season. Constantly high sulfide in waterlogged cores accompanied reduced plant growth. Aeration invigorated growth in drained cores but led to oxidization of sulfide minerals and to lowered pH. During the second growing season, growth declined in the drained treatment, probably because of acidification and decreased dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Results are pertinent to the success of current wetland protection and restoration activities in the coastal zone.

AB Drained peat soils are a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. Rewetting these soils is considered an important climate change mitigation tool to reduce emissions and create suitable conditions for carbon sequestration. Long-term monitoring is essential to capture interannual variations in GHG emissions and associated environmental variables and to reduce the uncertainty linked with GHG emission factor calculations. In this study, we present GHG balances: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) calculated for a 5-year period at a rewetted industrial cutaway peatland in Ireland (rewetted 7years prior to the start of the study); and compare the results with an adjacent drained area (2-year data set), and with ten long-term data sets from intact (i.e. undrained) peatlands in temperate and boreal regions. In the rewetted site, CO2 exchange (or net ecosystem exchange (NEE)) was strongly influenced by ecosystem respiration (R-eco) rather than gross primary production (GPP). CH4 emissions were related to soil temperature and either water table level or plant biomass. N2O emissions were not detected in either drained or rewetted sites. Rewetting reduced CO2 emissions in unvegetated areas by approximately 50%. When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the emission factors (calculated as 5-year mean of annual balances) for the rewetted site were (+/- SD) -104 +/- 80g CO2-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CO2 sink) and 9 +/- 2g CH4-C m(-2)yr(-1) (i.e. CH4 source). Nearly a decade after rewetting, the GHG balance (100-year global warming potential) had reduced noticeably (i.e. less warming) in comparison with the drained site but was still higher than comparative intact sites. Our results indicate that rewetted sites may be more sensitive to interannual changes in weather conditions than their more resilient intact counterparts and may switch from an annual CO2 sink to a source if triggered by slightly drier conditions.

AB Abandoned drained peatlands pose the greatest danger in terms of peat fires. This is especially true of abandoned, unrestored peat milling fields, the maximum areas of which are located in Moscow Oblast. The most effective way to reduce the fire hazard and improve the ecological condition of such lands in the absence of economic reasons for their use is rewetting and peatland restoration. It is necessary to prioritize objects for rewetting and to monitor the effectiveness of measures taken. Such objects can be of considerable size, difficult to pass and not amenable to ground mapping. Fires and rewetting contribute to rapid changes in vegetation cover. Their monitoring requires remote sensing data and, above all, multispectral satellite data. The large number of objects, their spatial distribution and the need for multi-year observations require a combination of data from different satellites. We present the experience of monitoring more than 73 thousand hectares of peatlands in Moscow Oblast rewetted in 2010-2013 after the fires of 2010. Current results show a reduction in the areas of open peat and dry grass vegetation, insignificant changes in the areas occupied by coniferous trees and progressive expansion of the area occupied by deciduous trees and shrubs, as well as an increase of hydrophilic communities and open water after rewetting and subsequent maintenance of the area. The developed and tested methodology makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of peatland rewetting to reduce the risk of peat fires, as well as to identify areas requiring additional measures. The proposed algorithm ensures reliable allocation in semi-automatic mode of 6 classes of vegetation/land cover, different in fire hazard and basic environmental characteristics that determine the fluxes of greenhouse gases, biodiversity and other ecosystem functions.

TI A rational design approach to peat ground improvement by vertical drains
SO SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Peat; Vertical drain method; Coefficient of consolidation; Settlement;
   Stability
AB Use of the vertical drain method (hereinafter called "VD") in peat ground is spreading to reduce residual settlement and increase strength by accelerating consolidation. In recent years, high embankments of nearly 10 m have been constructed on peat ground by using a combination of VDs, or plastic-board drains (PBDs) in particular, and various ground stabilization techniques. However, the conventional design methods include a number of unclear points. This paper focuses on the significant stress-dependency of coefficient of consolidation in peat, and describes a rational design approach to evaluating the long-term settlement and stability of foundation ground of VD-improved peat ground by modifying conventional design methods. The effect of VDs was evaluated from field observations on the settlement of test embankments constructed in Hokkaido, Japan, and simulations using the finite-element method were performed to interpret the behavior of the ground. A systematic series of parametric analyses demonstrated that, in peat ground with a high natural water content, the permeability decreases drastically as the load increases, and hence the residual settlement increases significantly and the stability is greatly reduced. Therefore, drain pitch needs to be considerably small under such conditions. Despite its common use in the conventional design of vertical drains, the accuracy of Barron's solution is naturally limited in peat ground with high natural water contents since it assumes a constant value for the coefficient of consolidation.

AB Species-environment relationships were studied between the occurrence of 13 fish and lamprey species and 9 mainly map-based environmental variables of Finnish boreal small streams. A self-organizing map (SOM) analysis showed strong relationships between the fish species and environmental variables in a single model (explained variance 55.9%). Besides basic environmental variables such as altitude, catchment size, and mean temperature, land cover variables were also explored. A logistic regression analysis indicated that the occurrence probability of brown trout, Salmo trutta L., decreased with an increasing percentage of peatland ditch drainage in the upper catchment. Ninespine stickleback, Pungitius pungitius (L.), and three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus L., seemed to benefit from urban areas in the upper catchment. Discovered relationships between fish species occurrence and land-use attributes are encouraging for the development of fish-based bioassessment for small streams. The presented ordination of the fish species in the mean temperature gradient will help in predicting fish community responses to climate change.

AB . Bogs, economically valuable wetlands, are subjected to exploitation in southern Canada. We addressed plant conservation within bogs mined for peat, in which small undisturbed remnants are left, mostly at the margins of the mined areas. The main goal of the study was to test whether these remnants act as refuges for plants which could recolonize areas that are planned for restoration after mining is completed. Mosses, lichens and vascular plants were sampled in remnants of 24 mined bogs in southeastern Canada during the summer of 1997. The vegetation was also sampled at the margins and centres of 24 nearby natural bogs in plots similar in size to these remnants. Using similarity analysis and ordination techniques, we found that plant species assemblages in remnants of mined bogs differ from those near the margins of natural bogs, and that certain species are associated with the centre of natural bogs, due to the presence of pools. We also showed that water conditions of remnants are affected by drainage due to peat mining. Sphagnum moss showed itself to be a key indicator of mining effects on vegetation. Implications for peat resource management and bog conservation are discussed.

DT Article
DE CALCIPHILOUS; DRAINAGE; GROUNDWATER COMPOSITION; MIRE REGENERATION;
   VEGETATION RECONSTRUCTION
AB The Lieper Posse is a calcareous, ground water-fed fen system, situated in the end-moraine area of northeastern Germany.  Nowadays the fen is partly drained and the vegetation adversely affected; hence regeneration measures are considered.  Here we report a pilot survey of the actual vegetation cover in relation to the hydrological conditions of the system.
   The vegetation in the central part of the fen system can be assigned to the Caricetum lasiocarpae, with small areas of Eleocharitetum quinqueflorae.  The southern part of the system includes a Ledo-Pinetum sylvestris bog.  Along the edges eutrophic forest types are present.
   Peat analysis revealed that the system started as an open lake and subsequently changed into a rheophilous mire, 'percolating mire'.  The southern bog has only recently come into being.  Hydrological investigations showed that the original mineral-rich ground water had to a large extent been replaced by acid rainwater; this is likely due to the construction of a ditch before 1850.  The effects of this drainage on hydrological conditions and some aspects of soil fertility are discussed.  Possible consequences for the restoration of calciphilous vegetation types are being considered.  It is concluded that the vegetation development is predictable only to a limited extent, which is mainly due to a lack of knowledge on hysteresis effects in both vegetation and soil.

AB Nitrate removal from runoff from agricultural land is in general required to reach a "good chemical status" of surface and groundwater bodies according to the European Water Framework Directive. Removing nitrates via heterotrophic denitrification is highly effective but requires stable anoxic environmental conditions as well as available organic carbon as electron donator. Constructed wetlands (CWs), established on peat soils, through which the nitrate-loaded water is routed, may provide denitrification favorable conditions. To study nitrate turnover, hydraulic properties and possible negative side effects of CWs on formerly drained fens, we developed a mesocosm experiment with vertical flow and an open water surface. The first flushing of nitrate during the exchange of the initial pore volume was quantified with 0.58 g NO3-N kg(-1) organic substance. Both nitrate and sulfate were released faster and in higher concentrations than DOC and with a ratio corresponding to the composition of the peat. Redox potential measurements revealed that denitrifying conditions established in certain soil depths after roughly 40 days of continuous flux. Transport properties were obtained from analyzing tracer breakthrough curves. It could be demonstrated that the degraded peat had a dual porosity structure. Subjected to nitrate enriched water for two years, the immobile pore water fraction increased from 40 to 80% probably because of physical consolidation processes and microbial activity and subsequent clogging of pores. This was not considered as negative since denitrification processes are believed to preferably operate in immobile, oxygen depleted water regions. We concluded that the first flushing of mineralized nitrate upon rewetting after onset of flux may compromise any positive clean up and nitrate removal effects occurring during long-term operation of peat-wetlands. It is thus advisable to recycle the water during early stages of the establishment of constructed wetlands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a process-based model (RCG-C) was developed, parameterized and calibrated for studying the annual and seasonal dynamics of the ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a cutaway peatland (Linnansuo, eastern Finland) cultivated with a perennial bioenergy crop (Phalaris arundinaceae, L., RCG). Based on a number of prior studies and an environmentally controlled experiment, RCG-C emphasized several key processes beyond the generality of previous diplotelmic models for pristine peatlands. These processes included the effects of management (e.g., drainage, peat extraction, tilling, harvesting and fertilization) on the soil hydrology and the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, the influence of climatic factors on photosynthesis and the phenological cycle and phenological and soil-moisture controls on biomass production and canopy development. The model was validated based on continuous measurements of meteorological parameters, energy and CO2 fluxes (eddy covariance system) performed at the site from 2005 to 2010, including variation associated with both wet and dry years. The results showed that the model captured the seasonal and annual trends of the latent heat flux and NEE during the six-year period. Moreover, the simulated values for the total C sink capacity, accumulation of rhizome biomass and peat formation from RCG obtained during the six-year period also agreed well with the field measurements. Based on the FINADAPT climate scenarios, a sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the potential increases in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) and air temperature (Ta) could be the main forces driving the changes in NEE. The model simulation suggested that the effects of Ta tend to offset those of Ca and lead to a decrease in the total C sink capacity of the site during the main rotation period (4-15th year of cultivation). This decrease tends to become more intensive toward the end of the 21st century. During the period from 2060 to 2099, the total CO2 sink capacity could decrease by 79% during the main rotation period at the Linnansuo site. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A drainage and fertilization experiment was established in 1989 in a tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) mixed natural stand growing on a minerotrophic peatland. The drained site was ditched in fall 1987. Fertilization treatments of N-P-K at 0:0:0, 0:80:120, 200:80:120, and 400:80:120 kg.ha-1 (N as urea) were applied in late May 1989. Tamarack short-shoot needles and black spruce current-year needles, sampled on 31 August 1989 and 2 September 1990, were analysed for unit needle mass and N, P, and K. Drainage without fertilization increased foliar N, P, and K concentration of tamarack and black spruce, with larger responses occurring in tamarack. However, drainage decreased needle mass of unfertilized black spruce, although net assimilation rate increased, suggesting that an increased proportion of photosynthate was allocated to root development. Needle mass of tamarack was not affected in 1989 but was increased in 1990 by drainage, indicating different acclimation mechanisms to drainage by the two species. Responses in unit needle mass and foliar N and P concentration of both species to P-K alone, and (or) N-P-K fertilization, were higher on the drained than on the undrained site. Increased availability and uptake of N and P with a lowered water table were a likely consequence of increased near-surface soil temperature, improved soil water - soil aeration relations, and accelerated N and P mineralization and uptake rates. Foliar N, P, and K of tamarack were more responsive to fertilization than those of black spruce. N-P-K elevated foliar N concentrations of tamarack and black spruce and resulted in concomitant increases in needle mass, suggesting that N was limiting both species. Addition of P-K alone increased foliar P concentration and foliar mass of tamarack, indicating a P limitation to tamarack growth.

AB The poor reputation of birch in Ireland is gradually changing, and the interest shown in it by foresters is growing, as is the recognition of the many advantages that this genus offers, especially from an afforestation and ecosystem development point of view. The potential of native birch species was investigated on industrial cutaway peatlands in the Irish midlands. Field experiments were established to evaluate differences (in terms of survival, growth attributes and form) between B. pendula and B. pubescens, between bare-root and container planting, and between small and medium size seedlings. After five growing seasons, B. pendula was found to be the superior species especially on well drained and shallow peat sites. Bare-root B. pendula will grow faster with reasonable form but containerised birch may be favoured on more difficult sites (with deeper and wetter peat). Larger seedlings performed better, regardless of species. This study demonstrated good growth potential for planted birch on cutaway peatlands and that this species should be integrated in further planting programmes.

AB A description of the bog-pine (Pinus uncinata var. rotundata) dominated vegetation of uncut oligotrophic mires affected by drainage is given. Surveys were carried out at 17 sites along the Jura Mountains (Switzerland and France) in 1993, 1994, and 1995. Raised bogs of the Jura are generally of small size, and most vegetation changes in them have occurred as a result of the indirect impact of peat cutting. This activity led to the peat drying out and to colonization by trees, in particular by bog-pines.
   Integrated synusial phytosociology was used to describe the vegetation where bog-pine, spruce, and birch occur. Two spatio-temporal levels of organization were considered: the synusia and the phytocoenosis. At the phytocoenosis level, four vegetation types representing bog-pine stands of uncut and deep oligotrophic peats are described with their constitutive synusial composition. They represent: (1) phytocoenoses developing in the open, wet central parts of the bogs, where trees are scattered and of small size, (2) phytocoenoses with layered tree stands of medium size and with a higher density, and (3) phytocoenoses with tall trees, developing generally near the edge of the bogs or close to peat cuttings. A generalized qualitative dynamic model of the vegetation in relation to the development of bog-pine trees was developed. It shows the spatial and temporal organization of the constituent synusiae, as well as other underlying hypothetical functional relations.
   The different bog-pine-dominated vegetation types described in this study appear to have coexisted since the origin of the Jura bogs as a result of local polyclimaxes induced by differential waterlogged situations. They probably all belong to the same (primary) successional series, but have been affected by both autogenic and allogenic processes. During the development of the bogs the balance between the different communities changed. In particular, the vegetation types with dense and tall pine trees have undergone a drastic expansion since the Jura bogs were first affected by drainage.

AB As soon as peat soil is drained for agricultural production, the peat starts to degrade, which causes emissions to the atmosphere. In countries with large peatland areas, the GHG mitigation potential related to management of these soils is often estimated as the highest amongst the measures available in agriculture. Although the facts are well known, the policies leading to diminished emissions are often difficult to implement. We have analysed the reasons why the mitigation potential is not fully utilized and what could be done better in national implementation of climate policies. Four cases are used to illustrate the necessary steps to reach mitigation targets: determining the amount and properties of peat soils, estimating the potential, costs and feasibility of the mitigation measures, and selecting and implementing the best measures. A common feature for all of the cases was that national and international climate policies have increased the public interest in GHG emissions from peat soils and increased the pressure for mitigation. Basically the same factors restrict the implementation of mitigation measures in all countries with significant peat soil areas. The most important of these is lack of policy coherence, e.g. ignoring climate policies when planning land use or agricultural policies. We conclude that GHG mitigation is achieved only if other policies, especially national regulations and strategies, are in line with climate policies.
   Policy relevance
   Agricultural peat soils could be used to help reach GHG mitigation goals in many countries, but the full potential of mitigation of peat soils is not used. Although peatland cultivation inevitably leads to loss of the whole peat layer and high emissions, there are few incentives or regulation to effectively minimize these losses. This article discusses the possibilities to reduce GHG emissions from agricultural peat soils, with specific emphasis on the barriers of implementing mitigation measures nationally. The lessons learned from the selected cases emphasize the role of all policy makers and their cooperation in planning coherent policies for achieving the goals determined by climate policies.

AB Studies were carried out during 1989-1992 at an experimental site in Rumster, Caithness to determine the initial effects, particularly on hydrochemistry, of the establishment of trees on deep peats. Inputs were measured to determine seasonal and between-year variability. Increases in potential interception due to the filtering effect of the maturing forest canopy were assessed. Results indicate that air quality improved during the study, particularly sulphate inputs, and suggest that loadings of marine-derived materials to the soil may be greatly increased in the future by canopy capture. Site disturbances by ploughing and draining have affected nutrient cycles, especially N and S, in both control and forested plots, leading to losses into drainage waters. After a delay of around a year, there were fertilizer losses of applied phosphorus (1-2 kgP ha(-1)) and potassium (25-35 kgK ha(-1)) over the period.

AB Nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) as well as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations and losses were studied for three and two years, respectively, in a small catchment dominated by a degraded peatland used as intensive grassland. Concentrations in the shallow groundwater were spatially and temporally very variable, with NO3-N being the most dynamic component (7.3 +/- 12.5 mg L-1) and ranging from 0 to 79.4 mg L-1. Average NO3-N concentrations of 10.3 +/- 5.4 mg L-1 (0 to 25.5 mg L-1) in the ditch draining the catchment and annual NO3-N losses of 19, 35 and 26 kg ha(-1) confirmed drained peatlands as an important source of diffuse N pollution. The highest NO3-N losses occurred during the wettest year. Resulting from concentration of 2.4 +/- 0.8 mg L-1 (0.7 to 6.2 mg L-1), DON added a further 4.5 to 6.4 kg ha(-1) to the N losses and thus formed a relevant (15 %) component of the total N losses. Ditch DOC concentrations of 24.9 +/- 5.9 mg L-1 (13.1 to 47.7 mg L-1) resulted in DOC losses of 66 kg ha(-1) in the wet year of 2006/2007 and 39 kg ha(-1) in the dry year of 2007/2008. Ditch DOC concentration were lower than the groundwater DOC concentration of 50.6 +/- 15.2 mg L-1 (14.9 to 88.5 mg L-1). Both DOC and N concentrations were governed by hydrological conditions, but NO3-N reacted much faster and clearer on rising discharge rates than DOC, which tended to be higher under drier conditions. In the third year of the study, the superposition of a very wet summer and land use changes from grassland to arable land in a part of the catchment suggests that, under re-wetting conditions with a high groundwater table in summer, NO3-N would diminish quickly, while DOC would remain on a similar level. Further intensification of the land use, on the other hand, would increase N losses to receiving water bodies.

AB The surface biomass of moss dominated by Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr. (Rusty Bog-moss) was harvested from a sparsely drained raised bog. Physical properties of the Sphagnum moss were determined and compared with those of weakly and moderately decomposed peats. Water retention curves (WRC) and saturated hydraulic conductivities (K-s) are reported for samples of Sphagnum moss with natural structure, as well as for samples that were cut to selected fibre lengths or compacted to different bulk densities. The gravimetric water retention results indicate that, on a dry mass basis, Sphagnum moss can hold more water than both types of peat under equal matric potentials. On a volumetric basis, the water retention of Sphagnum moss can be linearly increased by compacting at a gravimetric water content of 2 (g water / g dry mass). The bimodal water retention curve of Sphagnum moss appears to be a consequence of the natural double porosity of the moss matrix. The 6-parameter form of the double-porosity van Genuchten equation is used to describe the volumetric water retention of the moss as its bulk density increases. Our results provide considerable insight into the physical growing media properties of Sphagnum moss biomass.

AB Peatlands occupy 20% of the land area of Ireland and store over half of soil carbon stocks. Over 80% of these peatlands have been disturbed by human activity such as drainage for peat extraction, afforestation and agriculture. In this study, peat samples were collected from 12 horticultural peat extraction sites in the Irish midlands. The carbon (C), nitrogen (N), hydrogen and sulphur content were determined, and from these, the carbon oxidation state (C-ox) and oxidative ratio (OR) were calculated. The carbon oxidation ratio reflects organic matter synthesis and degradation, and is thus an important parameter in understanding terrestrial carbon cycling, whilst OR represents the molar ratio of oxygen (O-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes associated with net ecosystem exchange. Elemental concentrations and ratios were typical for Irish horticultural peat (e.g. carbon concentrations 54%-57%), though showed site to site variability. C(ox)and OR values varied between -0.22 and -0.11, and 1.04 and 1.07, respectively, and were comparable to United Kingdom peat soils. All values for OR were lower than 1.1, the value commonly used in global CO(2)partitioning studies. Further research should investigate OR values in peatland which has not been studied to date. Across all sites, measures of increased decomposition (i.e. C/N ratios) significantly correlated with increasing OR reflecting more reduced organic matter. This study provides data in temperate peat soils that increases the coverage of C(ox)and OR values and will inform global CO(2)partitioning studies.

AB Stability was tested on 46-year-old Sitka spruce trees (over 20 m tall) growing on gleyed soils. Trees with a range of root depths on peaty gley and surface-water gley soils were selected by studying their water regime. Trees were pulled over horizontally with a winch and the vertical displacement of the soil-root plate was measured as the load was applied. The resistive turning moment at the point of soil failure and the maximum resistive turning moment were measured. Thin plates, which developed over a shallow water table, had a greater surface area than thick plates that developed over deeper water tables. However, they also had a smaller soil mass and tended to shear in soil material of lower shear strength and were particularly flexible. Thicker plates sheared in stronger soil and were more rigid. Soil-root plate rigidity was shown to be a major factor affecting the contribution of soil resistance to overturning. Regression analysis revealed that the more rigid the plate the greater the applied turning moment at soil failure. Trees that develop rigid soil-root plates through adaptive growth of their structural roots will therefore also have improved stability. The results indicate that intensive drainage of peaty gleys will increase rooting depth and the resistance to overturning.

AB The majority of lochs and water courses in an area of northern Scotland were visited during July 1988. Breeding waterfowl and details of environmental variables were recorded for each site and subjected to multivariate classification techniques. Non-hierarchical classification identified seven habitat types on the basis of environmental parameters. These corresponded well with, and further sub-divided, categorisation using conventional trophic-level habitat type classifications. A hierarchical approach, using TWIN-SPAN, classified twelve waterfowl groupings based on the presence of indicator species. This approach identified characteristic community types and groupings with high diversity and hence conservation importance. Correspondence between habitat classifications and waterfowl communities was reasonable, but failure to identify key features of wetland complexity was probably the reason for the inability to identify clear relationships. Induction analysis was used to show that waterfowl species with the most restricted distributions characterised the main groupings, with Black-throated Diver and Common Scoter showing preferences for mesotrophic/eutrophic waters with islands, where peaty waters drain onto base-rich sandy substrates. Greylag Geese occurred on large acidic oligotrophic lochs and Wigeon on base-rich streams. The need for catchment-wide site-safeguard and management programmes to safeguard the wetlands of greatest significance is discussed.

AB In Europe peatlands are wetlands of postglacial origin. Because of climatic changes and agricultural activities (i.e. drainage and peat extraction), they are one of the most endangered ecosystems worldwide. Water mites are well known as indicators of changing environments in other ecosystems such as springs and lakes. For our study we selected seven peatlands located in North-Western Poland and focused on water mite distribution and associated habitat and water quality variables. We described water mite fauna in various microhabitats (aquatic and semiaquatic) along the mineral-richness gradient to test whether this gradient is reflected in the composition of water mite assemblages. We selected conductivity, pH and vegetation as variables reflecting the poor-rich gradient. Additionally, we measured water depth, temperature and dissolved oxygen, which are often important parameters for water mites. We also noted presence of prey and host taxa of particular water mite species. Based on physicochemical parameters we identified three types of habitats harbouring three distinctive species groups of water mites. We were able to distinguish species that appear to be typical of spring fens (e.g. Hygrobates norvegicus, Lebertia separata), connected with acidic, nutrient poor pools (e.g. Arrenurus neumani, A. pustulator) and species seemingly typical of temporary habitats dominated by Sphagnum mosses (e.g. Piersigia intermedia, Zschokkea oblonga, A. stecki). The poor-rich gradient is strongly reflected in the composition of water mite assemblages. We also found strong correlations between the water mite fauna and both conductivity and pH gradient. Our results show that water conductivity is the most important of the examined factors, driving mite-species distribution in peatlands.

AB Our understanding of hydraulic properties of peat soils is limited compared with that of mineral substrates. In this study, we aimed to deduce possible alterations of hydraulic properties of peat soils following degradation resulting from peat drainage and aeration. A data set of peat hydraulic properties (188 soil water retention curves [SWRCs], 71 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves [UHCs], and 256 saturated hydraulic conductivity [K-s] values) was assembled from the literature; the obtained data originated from peat samples with an organic matter (OM) content ranging from 23 to 97 wt% (weight percent; and according variation in bulk density) representing various degrees of peat degradation. The Mualem-van Genuchten model was employed to describe the SWRCs and UHCs. The results show that the hydraulic parameters of peat soils vary over a wide range confirming the pronounced diversity of peat. Peat decomposition significantly modifies all hydraulic parameters. A bulk density of approximately 0.2 g cm(-3) was identified as a critical threshold point; above and below this value, macroporosity and hydraulic parameters follow different functions with bulk density. Pedotransfer functions based on physical peat properties (e.g., bulk density and soil depth) separately computed for bog and fen peat have significantly lower mean square errors than functions obtained from the complete data set, which indicates that not only the status of peat decomposition but also the peat-forming plants have a large effect on hydraulic properties. The SWRCs of samples with a bulk density of less than 0.2 g cm(-3) could be grouped into two to five classes for each peat type (botanical composition). The remaining SWRCs originating from samples with a bulk density of larger than 0.2 g cm(-3) could be classified into one group. The Mualem-van Genuchten parameter values of alpha can be used to estimate K-s if no K-s data are available. In conclusion, the derived pedotransfer functions provide a solid instrument to derive hydraulic parameter values from easily measurable quantities; however, additional research is required to reduce uncertainty.

AB Degradation by drainage threatens biodiversity and globally important peatland ecosystem functions such as long-term carbon sequestration in peat. Restoration aims at safeguarding peatland values by recovering natural hydrology. Long-term effects of drainage and subsequent restoration, especially related to within-site variation of water table level and pore water chemistry, are poorly known. We studied hydrological variation at 38 boreal Sphagnum peatland sites (pristine, drained and restored) in Finland. The average water table level was significantly lower at Drained than Pristine sites especially near the ditches. We also observed large pore water chemical differences between Drained and Pristine sites, such as higher DOC concentration at the sites drained several decades earlier. Furthermore, there were large differences in water chemistry between the samples collected from ditches and from the peat strips between the ditches. For example, the ditch water had apparently higher minerogenic influence, while DOC concentrations were highest in peat strips. The water table level was, on average, at the targeted level of Pristine sites at 5 years ago restored (Res 5) and 10 years ago restored (Res 10) sites. The Res 10 sites were more similar to the Pristine sites in water chemical composition than were the Drained sites. Water chemical differences between ditches and peat strips were smaller at the Res 5 and Res 10 than at Drained sites indicating, on average, successful decrease of drainage-induced within-site variation in water chemistry. Our results suggest more pronounced water table inclination towards the old ditches at Res 10 than at Res 5 sites. While this pattern may be an early warning sign for incomplete recovery of hydrology in long-term, we found no chemical evidence supporting this assumption yet. Our study suggests that restoration can result in significant recovery of peatland hydrology within 10 years, while some deviation from pristine hydrology is still typical. Restoration appears to have potential to reduce leaching of nutrients and DOC to downstream waters in the long term, but practitioners should be prepared for temporary increase of leaching of N and P for at least 5 years after restoration of boreal Sphagnum peatlands.

AB Rewetting of long-term drained fens often results in the formation of eutrophic shallow lakes with an average water depth of less than 1 m. This is accompanied by a fast vegetation shift from cultivated grasses via submerged hydrophytes to helophytes. As a result of rapid plant dying and decomposition, these systems are highly dynamic wetlands characterised by a high mobilisation of nutrients and elevated emissions of CO2 and CH4. However, the impact of specific plant species on these phenomena is not clear. Therefore we investigated the CO2 and CH4 production due to the subaqueous decomposition of shoot biomass of five selected plant species which represent different rewetting stages (Phalaris arundinacea, Ceratophyllum demersum, Typha latifolia, Phragmites australis and Carex riparia) during a 154 day mesocosm study. Beside continuous gas flux measurements, we performed bulk chemical analysis of plant tissue, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and plant polymer dynamics. Plant-specific mass losses after 154 days ranged from 25 % (P. australis) to 64% (C. demersum). Substantial differences were found for the CH4 production with highest values from decomposing C. demersum (0.4 g CH4 kg(-1) dry mass day) that were about 70 times higher than CH4 production from C. riparia. Thus, we found a strong divergence between mass loss of the litter and methane production during decomposition. If C. demersum as a hydrophyte is included in the statistical analysis solely nutrient contents (nitrogen and phosphorus) explain varying greenhouse gas production of the different plant species while lignin and polyphenols demonstrate no significant impact at all. Taking data of annual biomass production as important carbon source for methanogens into account, high CH4 emissions can be expected to last several decades as long as inundated and nutrient-rich conditions prevail. Different restoration measures like water level control, biomass extraction and top soil removal are discussed in the context of mitigation of CH4 emissions from rewetted fens.

AB 1. Water-filled ditches are an important ecological feature of lowland Britain. Originally dug to facilitate wetland drainage, ditches often provide refuges for aquatic flora and fauna of high conservation value.
   2. The ditches, ponds and major waterways of a traditionally managed undrained fen and the ditches of a previously drained cattle-grazed fen meadow were sampled at Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve for Coleoptera, Mollusca and Odonata, and for physical, chemical and biological variables.
   3. Multivariate analysis showed a clear division between ditches on the two fens, and between larger and smaller waterbodies.
   4. Individual ditches possessed distinctive faunas. Ditch age and bank profile were important factors influencing faunal species composition.
   5. Invertebrate distributions were shown to be significantly correlated with macrophyte distribution.
   6. Waterbodies were ranked in terms of their species quality, using a point-scoring system; there was no correlation between rankings for the three invertebrate groups; only ditch age and detritus levels were correlated with species quality score (for Coleoptera).
   7. Ditch management recommendations are discussed in the light of these results.

AB Harvested sites rarely return to functional ecosystems after abandonment because drainage and peat extraction lower the water table and expose relatively decomposed peat, which is hydrologically unsuitable for Sphagnum moss reestablishment. Some natural regeneration of Sphagnum has occurred in isolated pockets on traditionally harvested (block-cut) sites, for reasons that are poorly understood, but are related to natural functions that regulate runoff and evaporation. This study evaluates the water balance of a naturally regenerated cutover bog and compares it with a nearby natural bog of similar size and origin, near Riviere du Loup, Quebec. Water balance results indicated that evapotranspiration was the major water loss from the harvested bog, comprising 92 and 84% of total outputs (2.9 mm day(-1)) during the 1997 and 1998 seasons, respectively. Despite denser tree cover at the harvested site, evapotranspiration from the natural bog was similar, although less spatially variable. At the harvested site, evaporative losses ranged from 1.9 mm day(-1) on raised baulks and roads to 3.6 mm day(-1) from moist surfaces with Sphagnum. Although about half of the ditches were:inactive or operating at only a fraction of their original efficiency, runoff was still significant at 12 and 24% of precipitation during the 1997 and 1998 study seasons, respectively. This compares with negligible rates of runoff at the natural bog. Thus the cutover bog, although abandoned over 25 years ago, has not regained its hydrological function. This is both a cause and effect of its inability to support renewed Sphagnum regeneration. Without suitable management (e.g. blocking ditches), this site is not likely to improve for a very long time. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Monitoring data over the period 1994-2007 were analysed for three streams (Cottage Hill Sike, CHS; Rough Sike, RS; Trout Beck, TB) draining blanket peat underlain by glacial clay and limestone-rich sub-strata at Moor House (Northern England). Dissolved organic carbon concentration, [DOC], showed complex relationships with both discharge and calcium concentration, [Ca]. A model based on [Ca] was constructed to simulate stream [DOC] by mixing dissolved organic matter (DOM) from shallow peat, quantified by measured [DOC] (15-30 mg l(-1)) in peat porewater, with DOM assumed to be present at a constant concentration (c. 5 mg l(-1)) in groundwater. A temperature-based adjustment to the measured porewater [DOC] was required to account for relatively low streamwater [DOC] during winter and spring. The fitted model reproduced short-term variation in streamwater [DOC] satisfactorily, in particular variability in RS and TB due to groundwater contributions. Streamwater DOM is largely derived from surface peat, which accounts for more than 96% of the total DOC flux in both RS and TB, and 100% in CHS. Model outputs were combined with streamwater and porewater (DOC)-C-14 data to estimate the C-14 contents, and thereby the ages, of DOM from peat and groundwater. The peat-derived DOM is 5 years old on average, with most of it very recently formed. The derived age of groundwater DOM (8,500 years) is comparable to the 4,000-7,000 years estimated from the (DOC)-C-14 of water extracts of clay underlying the peat, suggesting that the clay is the source of groundwater DOM.

AB Northern peatlands are globally significant soil carbon sinks but contribute a significant amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to streams. Climate change driven warming and drying will likely alter peatland DOC dynamics; however, few field studies have quantified the individual and interactive effects of temperature and moisture changes. Using a full factorial water table (control, drained 2 years [experimental], drained 12 years [drained]) x warming (ambient, open-top chamber warming) x microform (hummock, hollow) study design, we monitored DOC concentration and spectrophotometric properties (specific ultraviolet absorbance [SUVA], E2/E3, E4/E6) in a wooded boreal bog in Alberta, Canada. Ecohydrological conditions including water table (WT), soil temperature, plant cover, biomass, and productivity were also measured at each plot. We observed a significant interaction between WT treatment, warming and microform for explaining variation in DOC concentrations, with the highest values at drained, warmed hummocks. Overall, drainage resulted in higher DOC concentration. DOC concentration and E2/E3 increased, whereas SUVA decreased, in response to greater plant productivity (i.e., more negative values of gross ecosystem photosynthesis). For DOC concentration and SUVA, this correlation was largely driven by drained, warmed hummocks where shrub growth increased. Moreover, redundancy analysis indicated that shrub and lichen cover, along with WT and soil temperature, were important for explaining variation in DOC concentration and quality. The results indicate that, although DOC concentrations in peatlands are likely to increase under climate change, much of this increase may be from recent carbon fixation, suggesting more rapid carbon cycling as opposed to destabilization of existing carbon stocks.

AB Peatlands in Ireland have been subject to peat extraction and drainage for many years, with detrimental effects on the flora and fauna of the ecosystem. Blanket bog has been listed for protection under Annex 1. of the EU habitats directive, making the conservation of intact bogs as well as the restoration of degraded sites a priority. In order to assess how effective a restoration measure this has been it is important to look at the biodiversity within the site. This study compared the macroinvertebrate and microcrustacean communities ill open-water habitats of an intact and a. restored mountain blanket bog in County Wicklow over a number of seasons. It also examined the hydrochemistry of both treatments. Hydrochemically there was no difference between the restored and intact pools. Neither was there any significant difference between the two in terms of taxon richness, abundance, community composition or structure. Season was found to significantly affect the structure of the invertebrate communities in both areas. It is not known how long it takes a peatland to return to its natural state. However, we can conclude that the restoration measures implemented fifteen years ago have provided an aquatic habitat similar to that of the intact site.

Data were collected once a month from May till September 2012 and in May, July and September 2013 and 2014 in Shichengskoe and Alekseevskoe-1 mires (Vologda Region, Russia). Water samples were kept in a cooling bag and transported to the laboratory within a day. Prior to analyses, water samples were filtered (pore size 90 mm). Colour of water, pH, permanganate value, dry residues, and total iron, manganese, carbonate, phosphate, sulphate and nitrate ion concentrations were measured. Data were obtained by the atomic absorption spectrometry and spectrophotometric and titrimetric methods. The pH values varied from 3.7 in Sphagnum hollows to 6.9 in a bog stream and 7.2 in a primary intra-mire lake. The minimum permanganate value of 5.6 mg O/L was registered in a bog stream, the maximum of 150.4 mg O/L in a weakly waterlogged Sphagnum hollow. Dry residue values varied in a range of 35 mg/L in a large hollow-pool to 315 mg/L in a flow-through fen strip. The data are useful for investigating chemical composition of waters in different mire water bodies and the heterogeneity of these abiotic factors. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID ORGANIC-MATTER; FOREST-FIRES; DEGRADATION; SEDIMENTS
AB Amount, stability, and distribution of black carbon ( BC) were studied at four sites of a large peatland ("Witzwil") formerly used as a disposal for combustion residues from households to derive BC displacement rates in the profile. Possible artefacts from thermal oxidation with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) on BC quantification of C-rich deposits were inferred by choosing three sites from a second peatland with no historical record of waste disposal as a reference ("Seebodenalp"). All sites were under grassland at time of sampling, but were partially cropped in the past at Witzwil. Mean BC contents in topsoils of Witzwil ranged from 10.7 to 91.5 (0-30 cm) and from 0.44 to 51.3 (30-140 cm) mg BC g(-1) soil, corresponding to BC/OC ratios of 0.04 to 0.3 (topsoil) and 0.02 to 0.18 (deeper soil). At three sites of Seebodenalp, BC was below the detection limit of 0.4 mg g(-1) organic soil, indicating negligible formation of BC during thermal oxidation of peat. (13)C NMR spectra corroborated the high BC contents at Witzwil. The data support a considerable vertical transport of BC given that soils were ploughed not deeper than 30 cm since abandonment of waste application about 50 years ago. The total amount of BC in the Witzwil profiles ranged from 3.2 to 7.5 kg BC m(-2), with 21 to 69 percent of it stemming from below the former ploughing depth. Under the premise of negligible rates of BC consumption since abandonment of waste application, minimum BC transport rates in these peats are 0.6 to 1.2 cm a(-1). The high mobility of BC might be explained by high macropore volumes in combination with occasional water saturation. By means of DSC peak temperatures, different types of BC could be distinguished, with deeper horizons containing BC of higher thermal stability. Application of combustion residues likely involved a mixture of various BC types, of which thermally more stable ones, most likely soots, were preferentially transported downwards.

   CONCEPTUALIZATION
AB Riparian wetlands (RW) are important variable source areas for runoff generation. They are usually characterised by a combination of groundwater exfiltrationwhich maintains saturated conditions in low-lying organic-rich soilsand direct precipitation. Both processes interact to generate overland flow as a dominant runoff process. The small-scale details of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions are usually not well understood in RW. Here, we report the results of a study from an experimental catchment in the Scottish Highlands where spatio-temporal runoff processes in RW were investigated using isotopes, alkalinity and hydrometric measurements. We focused on perennial micro-catchments within the RW and ephemeral zero-order channels draining peatland hollows and hummocks to better understand the heterogeneity in GW-SW interactions. The 12-month study period was dominated by the wettest winter (December/January) period on record. Runoff generation in the RW was strongly controlled by the local groundwater response to direct rainfall, but also the exfiltration of groundwater from upslope. This groundwater drainage is focused in the hollows in ephemeral and perennial drainage channels, but in wet conditions, as exfiltration rates increase, can affect hummocks as well. The hollows provide the dominant areas for mixing groundwater, soil water and direct rainfall to deliver water to the stream network as hollows fill and spill to increase connectivity. They also provide wet areas for evaporation which is evident in enriched isotope signatures in summer. Although there is some degree of heterogeneity in the extent to which groundwater influences specific micro-catchments, particularly under low flows, the overall isotopic response is quite similar, especially when the catchment is wet and this responses can explain the isotope signatures observed in the stream. In the future, more longitudinal studies of micro-catchments are needed to better explain the heterogeneity observed.

AB Mapping peatland extent in Canada would contribute important information concerning carbon balance and hydrology. While such mapping, based on air photo interpretation and remote sensing data, has recently improved, maps have been limited to 1:1 million scale. We hypothesized that forest structure information from forest inventory plots could be used to predict the presence of forested and treed peat lands in boreal Canada at the ground plot-level, and that a resulting model could be used to predict the distribution of forested and treed peatlands across Canada. Inventory ground plots from the Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI) with organic soil depth measurements were used to create a model of the presence of treed to forested (canopy cover ranging from sparse to closed) peatlands (greater than 40 cm organic soil depth) in boreal Canada. The presence of black spruce (Picea mariana) or larch (Larix laricina), in combination with low stand height and stand age greater than 75 years, were the strongest predictors of the presence of peatlands. Bioclimatic variables related to high diurnal and annual temperature variation, consistent with a continental climate, also contributed to the increased predicted presence of treed peatlands. Both logistic and boosted regression tree models showed similar results, with similar to 87% accuracy in the discrimination of treed peatlands when validated against an independent set of ground plots. The boosted regression tree model was propagated across Canada using forest attribute raster data layers at 250 m resolution from the NFI along with bioclimatic layers. Estimates of treed peatland extent agreed with data points from peat cores with 85-95% accuracy in the Boreal Shield ecozone, although prediction was less accurate in the more southern boreal and Great Lakes forest areas. The resulting map can be used as an input to forest carbon modelling, and the improved knowledge of treed peatland extent will be useful in modelling wildfire or peatland drainage.

AB After the lapse of 48 years, a renewed study on species composition of desmids was carried out at the Bloto peat bog in the Niepolomice Forest. During this period, the peat bog underwent far-reaching changes caused by man. Out of 41 species recorded by Wasylik (1955), the occurrence of only 11 was confirmed. However, 14 species absent at the time of the earlier study were found. In all, 25 species of desmids were found. ne present state of the desmid flora was brought about by increase of pH, draining of the area, disappearance of peat mosses and probably by eutrophication of waters in the studied area.

AB Anthropogenic disturbance often causes changes in communities. However, the mechanistic basis of these changes remains elusive. As all patterns in community ecology can be understood as a result of four processes (speciation, selection, drift, and dispersal), the effect of disturbance should depend on how disturbance disrupt these processes. We studied the effects of disturbance and productivity on species richness, community composition, and community dispersion (i.e., variation in community composition) in the vegetation of 120 boreal peatlands using null-model approach to determine whether community assembly processes differ between pristine and disturbed sites. Sites represented three peatland ecosystem types, each with two levels of productivity. Half of the sites were disturbed by drainage and half are pristine. Pristine and disturbed sites showed similar species richness. However, their community composition differed indicating a directional selection due to disturbance, whereas dispersion of disturbed and pristine communities did not differ suggesting no change in the relative strength of selection and drift. Our results suggest that understanding the combination of landscape level community changes and local selection pressures is important when restoration of degraded ecosystems is undertaken.

AB Stable isotopes of water are one of the most widely used tools to track the pathways of precipitation inputs to streams. In the past, soils have often been treated as black-boxes through which precipitation is routed to streams without much consideration of how, when, and where water is transported along soil and groundwater flow paths. Here, we use time series of stable isotopes (O-18) in precipitation, soil/groundwater, and stream water to evaluate how landscape structure and heterogeneity influence seasonal hydrological patterns characteristic of boreal headwater catchments. To do this, we collected water throughout a full year at three adjacent catchments draining forest, mire, and mire/lake ecosystems within the Krycklan Experimental Catchment of northern Sweden. Isotope time series from forest and mire groundwater piezometers showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the dominant hydrologic flow pathways connecting precipitation to stream flow at different sites. The isotopic signature of stream water suggested strong connections to the dominant landscape elements within each catchment. These connections translated into greater temporal variability in the isotopic response of streams draining lake and wetland patches, and a much more attenuated pattern in the forest-dominated catchment. Overall, seasonal changes in the isotopic composition of streams and groundwater illustrate how differences in landscape structure result in variable hydrological patterns in the boreal landscape.

AB With the increase in the drainage and extraction of peat for horticultural, agricultural and energy purposes worldwide, there is an increased pressure to restore hydrological conditions essential to the re-establishment of Sphagnum mosses and, therefore, carbon sequestration. Measurements of ecosystem CO2 were conducted Lit a recently restored vacuum harvested bog in Eastern Quebec, Canada. The peatland was restored by blocking the drainage networks to return optimal water table positions for the growth of Sphagnum mosses and the spreading of a dense straw mulch layer to reduce evaporative losses and stabilize the surface for the moss re-growth. However, the return Of the moss species is a gradual process and previous studies have suggested that initially the carbon loss from the system actually increase as the mulch decomposes. We examined old and new mulch CO2 production in lab incubations and scaled these results to the ecosystem level in order to determine if mulch decomposition is impeding the net carbon sink function of this peatland. At mean growing season temperatures fresh mulch was observed to release 151.5 mumol CO2 g(-1) per day, while older mulch released 145 mumol CO2 g(-1) per day. Furthermore, under moist conditions the CO2 release increased for all mulches. However, contrary to most assumptions, Q(10) values for all mulches decreased with increasing temperatures and were greater for older mulch than for fresh. Thus, in the short term, the application of a surface straw mulch layer can have significant effects on the carbon balance of a restored peatland. Due to the decomposition of this mulch layer over the first several seasons of restoration, the peatland became a larger source of CO2, despite the increase in production of a re-emerging vegetation layer.

AB Proper understanding of the deviatoric behaviour of peats represents a challenge in soil mechanics. Exceptional high compressibility together with extremely high friction angles distinguishes peats from classical organic soils. Considerable amount of triaxial test data on peats can be found in the literature, mostly coming from standard undrained triaxial compression tests. However, only a minor part was intended to describe their prefailure behaviour. Also, limiting the investigation to the undrained response reduces the information on those ingredients of constitutive models, which are necessary to describe the deformational behaviour. This contribution aims to provide better insight into the prefailure deformational behaviour of peats, by analysing in detail the results of non-standard drained tests at various stress paths and undrained tests performed on reconstituted peat samples. Based on the experimental findings, an existing hypoplastic model, originally developed for fine-grained soils, has been adapted to capture the behaviour of peats. The model is directly calibrated on selected experimental results and validated on a variety of different stress path tests. The results reveal the merits of hypoplasticity in modelling the nonlinearity of the prefailure behaviour and the directional response of peats, which both are of great importance when assessing the serviceability limit states of geotechnical structures founded on peats.

AB Base cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) and metals (Al, Fe, Mn) were measured in peatlands of the northern and central Everglades to (i) determine the extent and degree of elemental enrichment of the peat caused by agricultural drainage and (ii) assess the relationship between cattail (Typha latifolia L.) encroachment into sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) communities and elemental (cations, metals, P) enrichment of the peat. Soil Ca, Mg, and Na (0-10 cm) decreased, and Al and Fe increased from north to south through the northern and central Everglades. Ln particular, nutrient-enriched (P) areas of northern WCA 2A had higher concentrations and accumulation rates of Ca, Mg, and Na than areas to the south. A detailed investigation along a P enrichment gradient in northern WCA 2A revealed a gradient of Ca and Na enrichment extending 1.6 to 3.4 km downstream of the Hillsboro canal, the source of agricultural drainage to WCA 2A. Rates of Ca (35 g/m(2) per yr) and Na (1.5-3.2 g/m(2) per yr) accumulation were 2 to 10 times greater 1.6 km below the Hillsboro canal than in areas 3.4 to 10.7 km downstream. Correlation analysis revealed that macrophyte species composition along the enrichment gradient was highly correlated with soil P (0-24 cm) but not with soil Na or Ca. The percent frequency of cattail (r = 0.74) and other species (r = 0.66) was positively correlated while sawgrass (r = -0.83) was inversely correlated with soil P content. These findings suggest that cattail encroachment into sawgrass communities Is favored by enrichment of the peat with P loadings from agricultural drainage pumped into northern WCA 2A.

AB Intensively managed grasslands on organic soils are a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) therefore has set the default emission factor at 8 kg N-N2O ha(-1) year(-1) for cultivation and management of organic soils. Also, the Dutch national reporting methodology for greenhouse gases uses a relatively high calculated emission factor of 4.7 kg N-N2O ha(-1) year(-1). In addition to cultivation, the IPCC methodology and the Dutch national methodology account for N2O emissions from N inputs through fertilizer applications and animal urine and faeces deposition to estimate annual N2O emissions from cultivated and managed organic soils. However, neither approach accounts for other soil parameters that might control N2O emissions such as groundwater level. In this paper we report on the relations between N2O emissions, N inputs and groundwater level dynamics for a fertilized and grazed grassland on drained peat soil. We measured N2O emissions from fields with different target groundwater levels of 40 cm ('wet') and 55 cm ('dry') below soil surface in the years 1992, 1993, 2002, 2006 and 2007. Average emissions equalled 29.5 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) and 11.6 kg N-N2O ha(-1) year(-1) for the dry and wet conditions, respectively. Especially under dry conditions, measured N2O emissions exceeded current official estimates using the IPCC methodology and the Dutch national reporting methodology. The N2O-N emissions equalled 8.2 and 3.2% of the total N inputs through fertilizers, manure and cattle droppings for the dry and wet field, respectively and were strongly related to average groundwater level (R (2) = 0.74). We argue that this relation should be explored for other sites and could be used to derive accurate emission data for fertilized and grazed grasslands on organic soils.

AB Extensive drainage of UK peatlands has been associated with dehydration of the peat, an increase in water colour and a loss of carbon storage. It has been considered that the blocking of these drainage channels represents a means of peat restoration and a way of reducing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) losses to surface waters. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of drain blocking at both an individual drain scale and at a larger catchment scale (up to 1 km(2)). A series of blocked and unblocked catchments were studied in Upper Teesdale, Northern England. A detailed sampling programme was undertaken in which a series of drains were studied in the 12 months prior to and post blocking in comparison to a set of drains that were left unblocked and a catchment of similar scale where there had never been drainage. These stream networks were monitored for both their DOC concentration and export (flux per unit area). The results show that:
   (i) For DOC concentrations, a significant decline due to drain-blocking was only found at the first order scale when considered relative to control and relative to a pre-blocking period;
   (ii) drain blocking significantly reduces DOC export by reducing water yield in the drain and that the size of this DOC export reduction declines with increasing scale from 9.2% on zero order drains to 2.2% on first order drains;
   (iii) a linear relationship exists between DOC export and water yield at the zero order scale but this relationship becomes more complex at the first order scale as the relationship takes on the characteristics of a mixing model reflecting the effect of changing water sources with scale and providing evidence of the existence of flow bypassing drain blocks.
   The results suggest that effects of drain blocking decrease with increasing scale and that the presence of bypass flow around zero order blockages may limit the success of drain blocking as a method of reducing DOC loss as scale increases. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental authorities require quantitative predications of the nitrogen retention ability of riparian peatlands to aid in the selection of effective water management strategies for restoration. To support this decision-making process, a matrix model connecting flow paths and nitrogen transformation was developed with a quasi-stationary mass balance approach. The model concept is based on the assumptions that wetlands (1) receive water and nitrogen along several hydrological pathways, and (2) transformation of nitrogen occurs inside the wetland with different efficiencies, depending on the transition pattern between inflow and outflow pathways. These assumptions are formalized in a set of vectors describing the amount of water and the nitrogen concentration for each inflow pathway, a water distribution matrix between the inflowing water and several outflow pathways, a nitrogen transformation coefficient matrix of each inflow and outflow combination and, finally, two outflow vectors with the amount of water flowing out and the calculated nitrogen concentrations of each outflow pathway. The matrix model is applied to a drained valley peatland in order to quantify the effect of different water management options on an increase in nitrogen retention.

AB In the boreal zone, large areas of natural mires have been drained and used for agriculture, resulting in net carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions and increased nitrous oxide emissions but decreased methane emissions. However, due to structural changes in agriculture, a substantial area of cropland on organic soil has been afforested. In order to estimate the carbon balance of afforested organic-soil cropland, we measured CO, and water vapour (H 20) fluxes during year above a Scots pine plantation (Pinus sylvestris) in the middle-boreal zone, using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method. We observed CO2 uptake by the Scots pine stand from late April to mid-October with a daily average net uptake from May to the beginning of October. However, there were also periods of daily net efflux. High ecosystem respiration rates continued throughout the winter (mean winter respiration 0.036 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). As an annual average, the 30-year-old pine stand was a small source of CO2 (+50 g m(-2) a(-1)) to the atmosphere, showing that the CO2 sequestration into the ecosystem was able to compensate for most of the carbon that was released by heterotrophic respiration from the drained soil.

AB The drainage of peatland areas for peat extraction, agriculture or bioenergy requires affordable, simple and reliable treatment methods that can purify waters rich in particulates and dissolved organic carbon. This work focused on the optimisation of chemical purification process for the direct dosage of solid metal salt coagulants. It investigated process requirements of solid coagulants and the influence of water quality, temperature and process parameters on their performance. This is the first attempt to provide information on specific process requirements of solid coagulants. Three solid inorganic coagulants were evaluated: aluminium sulphate, ferric sulphate and ferric aluminium sulphate. Pre-dissolved aluminium and ferric sulphate were also tested with the objective of identifying the effects of in-line coagulant dissolution on purification performance. It was determined that the pre-dissolution of the coagulants had a significant effect on coagulant performance and process requirements. Highest purification levels achieved by solid coagulants, even at 30% higher dosages, were generally lower (5%-30%) than those achieved by pre-dissolved coagulants. Furthermore, the mixing requirements of coagulants pre-dissolved prior to addition differed substantially from those of solid coagulants. The pH of the water samples being purified had a major influence on coagulant dosage and purification efficiency. Ferric sulphate (70 mg/L) was found to be the best performing solid coagulant achieving the following load removals: suspended solids (59%-88%), total organic carbon (56%-62%), total phosphorus (87%-90%), phosphate phosphorus (85%-92%) and total nitrogen (33%-44%). The results show that the use of solid coagulants is a viable option for the treatment of peatland-derived runoff water if solid coagulant-specific process requirements, such as mixing and settling time, are considered.

AB Loss of peatland vegetation is a global problem with negative consequences for the quality of catchment drainage waters. Vegetation can be lost through a combination of human and natural processes, leading to areas of exposed bare peat frequently accompanied by loss of surface moisture due to drainage or gullying. Waters draining such degraded peatlands are likely to have increased levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other nutrients, which can adversely impact the global climate, drinking water supplies and freshwater ecology. Consequently peatland revegetation efforts have become widespread.
   This paper presents results from a four-year study conducted to monitor the water quality impacts of a bare peat revegetation approach, which used landscape scale application of lime and fertiliser to encourage a grass nurse crop. This study considers an area of severely degraded blanket peat in the UK uplands, with large areas of bare peat prior to revegetation and provides the largest field dataset to date on the effects of this method on catchment run-off waters. Despite concerns that liming could increase DOC concentrations, the revegetation method is not shown to have this effect over the time period, and interestingly results in short term periods of suppression. The mechanism for this novel and unexpected finding merits further investigation and results in reduced DOC concentration, by up to 14 mg/l or 50% of control values, combined with periods of reduced colour carbon ratios. The data show that other nutrients were largely unaffected although rates of phosphate (PO43-) export were above recommended levels in the first year of application, suggesting initial phosphorus (P) application rates may require adjustment. Further investigation is required to consider the longer term effects of this restoration method as the vegetation matures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the effect of afforestation on soil CO2 emissions in blanket peat. The study sites were as follows: two undrained blanket peatland sites, six sites which had been drained and afforested 3, 19, 23, 27, 33 and 39 years previously, and two forest sites which were clearfelled in summer 1996. Soil CO2 emissions were measured using the soda-lime method during 13 sampling campaigns throughout 1997. Each campaign consisted of two consecutive 24-h measurements. Comparison of the average annual CO2 emission revealed no clear pattern in relation to soil type and suggests that afforestation does not always lead to an increase in soil CO2 emissions. In the most recently forested site, CO2 emissions were similar to 1.7 t C ha(-1) a(-1) and drainage had failed to lower the water-table sufficiently to cause a large increase in CO2 emissions. In the 19-, 23-, 27- and 33-year-old sites soil CO2 emissions were similar to 1.0-1.4 t C ha(-1) a(-1) and were similar to, or lower than, levels in the undrained sites. In the 39-year-old site average CO2 emissions were 2.6 t C ha(-1) a(-1). In the clearfelled sites CO2 emissions were lower at between 1.4 and 1.6 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Root respiration appears to account for a large proportion of CO2 emissions, and blanket peat, despite drainage, is resistant to decay. It is concluded that losses of soil C are compensated by C uptake by the trees.

AB Storms are the main abiotic disturbance in European forests, effects of which are expected to intensify in the future, hence the importance of forest stand stability is increasing. The predisposition of Norway spruce to wind damage appears to be enhanced by pathogens such as Heterobasidion spp., which reduce stability of individual trees. However, detailed information about the effects of the root rot on the stability of individual trees across diverse soil types is still lacking. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of root rot on the individual tree stability of Norway spruce growing on drained peat and mineral soils. In total, 77 Norway spruce trees (age 50-80 years) growing in four stands were tested under static loading. The presence of Heterobasidion spp. had a significant negative effect on the bending moment at primary and secondary failure of the tested trees irrespectively of soil type. This suggests increased legacy effects (e.g., susceptibility to pathogens and pests due to fractured roots and altered water uptake) of storms. Damaged trees act as weak spots increasing the susceptibility of stands to wind damage, thus forming a negative feedback loop and contributing to an ongoing decline in vitality of Norway spruce stands following storms in the study region in the future. Accordingly, the results support the importance of timely identification of the decayed trees, lowering stand density and/or shortening rotation period as the measures to counteract the increasing effects of storms on Norway spruce stands.

ID BOG
AB Exploitation of peatlands results in the degradation of hydrophysical conditions suitable for the re-establishment of peat-forming vegetation, notably Sphagnum mosses. Regeneration of peat-forming mosses necessitates a high and stable water table. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of open water reservoirs constructed to improve the hydrologic conditions required for growth of Sphagnum. A section of abandoned peatland, where former drainage ditches have been blocked, was treated by excavating reservoir ditches at 3-, 5-, and 8-m intervals to increase the local water storage. The colonization of Sphagnum fuscum and S. angustifolium diaspores scattered on the experimental baulks between the reservoir ditches was measured. Results indicate that water storage increased at the experimental site. The water table was higher and more stable, with an average maximum depth of 0.46 m at the rewetted site compared to 0.55 m at the control site. The volumetric moisture content of the surface peat was improved by rewetting, showing an average of 62% compared to 55% at the control site. Negative soil water tension at the -0.1 m depth was ameliorated at the experimental sites and nearly eliminated where 5-m experimental ditch-reservoir spacing was employed. Sphagnum establishment was successful on all experimental baulks, showing a higher percentage cover where soil moisture was more readily available.

AB In this paper we present a model of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and fluxes in mire water based on the convection-dispersion equation. The dynamics of sorbed, potentially soluble organic carbon (SPSOC) in the peat matrix are simulated in parallel with DOC. First, the model is applied solely to stagnant water conditions in order to interpret the results of laboratory peat incubations, with the focus on sorption processes. Some important model parameters are derived using literature data complemented by information from new incubation experiments. Second, the model is fully applied to simulate the DOC concentrations in the outlet of a steam draining a small headwater mire in northern Sweden during the period 1993-2001. A relatively good model fit (mean bias error (MBE) = -0.6-2.2 mg L-1, Willmott index of agreement d > 0.7 for the daily concentrations) was found for all the categories of stream discharge, except periods with very low flow (q < 0.3 mm d(-1)). When seeking explanations for the interannual variability in DOC concentrations, we, like previous authors, could find the influence of temperature, flow path, and intensity. However, the model has helped to demonstrate that the system also has a "memory'': the store of sorbed, potentially soluble organic carbon in a year affects the DOC concentrations and fluxes in the following year.

ID BOREAL SPRUCE FOREST; SWEDEN; PATTERNS; WOOD
AB The bryophyte vegetation of 3 pairs of unmanaged and managed forest stands, representing Oxalis drained peatland, Aegopodium and Oxalis forest site type, were compared. The total number of bryophyte species in unmanaged stands was 74 and that in managed stands 54. Out of the 20 species occurring only in unmanaged forests, 9 grow on decaying wood, and 3 on trunks or bases of big trees; 13 of them were hepatics. In unmanaged forests 11 hemerophobic species were recorded altogether. Although the difference in substrate and species diversity between unmanaged and managed stands is not statistically significant, in unmanaged forests more substrates characteristic for an old-growth stand are available, and the percentage of species preferring dryer habitats or prolonged humidity is a bit higher than in managed forests; the percentage of species associated with better illuminated habitats is higher in managed forests. Analysis of classification structure of the bryophyte layer synusia shows that the number of societies is also higher in unmanaged forests. This is associated with more numerous microhabitats; the average light and humidity indices calculated for every society, confirm this conclusion. The large discrepancy in bryophyte layer classification structure in old-growth and managed forests of the same forest site type is manifested not so much by species content in synusia as by their abundance proportions. The larger diversity of classification units in unmanaged forests is also seen at the synusia facies level; four of nine facies are confined exclusively to unmanaged stands. This is a strong argument for the informativeness of bryophyte layer classification structure for purposes of indication and monitoring as well.

AB Peatlands host a large number of highly specialised species and are important carbon storage and freshwater reservoirs, but are heavily threatened by, e.g., peat extraction and drainage. For improved protection of peatlands, the development of an ecological assessment system is necessary. Existing systems based, for instance, on peat formation and water level are rather coarse and differ between countries. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the predictive power of biodiversity indicators - particularly invertebrates (Oribatida, Araneae, Carabidae) and vegetation - for more finely reflecting environmental conditions in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in order to determine which taxonomic groups should be included in an ecological assessment system for peatlands. Therefore, we selected three plots in each of four peatland study sites in a German low mountain range and sampled the taxonomic groups using standard methods appropriate to represent assemblage structure and site diversity (Oribatida: Sphagnum samples; Araneae, Carabidae: pitfalls traps; vegetation: vegetation surveys). Our results indicate the necessity of implementing different taxonomic groups into an overall ecological assessment system, as all of them reacted differently to different ecological gradients. Oribatid mites were the best predictors of moisture, one of the most important factors in peatlands. Ground-dwelling spiders responded to several different factors; most remarkably, they strongly correlated with landscape area covered by peatland-related Natura 2000 habitat types, as a proxy for habitat quality. Carabidae most strongly correlated with the size of the Sphagnum plots, moss cover and moisture, but their species richness was very low. Vegetation, as the best established indicator group in peatlands, showed the weakest correlations to the tested environmental parameters, probably due to short-term changes in environmental conditions and a delayed response of the plant community. Hence, the set of most relevant environmental parameters can only be represented when multiple taxa are included in an assessment system. Also, overall biodiversity is not represented by a single taxon, because the correlation in assemblage similarity between the taxonomic groups was low. Considering ecological sensitivity, sampling effort (=number of samples and necessary site visits), taxonomic stability and state of knowledge on species' habitat requirements, we therefore suggest the inclusion of ground-dwelling spiders, oribatid mites and vegetation in an ecological assessment system for peatlands, complemented by a few sensitive, easy to recognize indicator species of other taxonomic groups.

AB Coastal plains are amongst the most densely populated areas in the world. Many coastal peatlands are drained to create arable land. This is not without consequences; physical compaction of peat and its degradation by oxidation lead to subsidence, and oxidation also leads to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study complements existing studies by quantifying total land subsidence and associated CO2 respiration over the past millennium in the Dutch coastal peatlands, to gain insight into the consequences of cultivating coastal peatlands over longer timescales. Results show that the peat volume loss was 19.8 km(3), which lowered the Dutch coastal plain by 1.9 m on average, bringing most of it below sea level. At least 66 % of the volume reduction is the result of drainage, and 34 % was caused by the excavation and subsequent combustion of peat. The associated CO2 respiration is equivalent to a global atmospheric CO2 concentration increase of similar to 0.39 ppmv. Cultivation of coastal peatlands can turn a carbon sink into a carbon source. If the path taken by the Dutch would be followed worldwide, there will be double trouble: globally significant carbon emissions and increased flood risk in a globally important human habitat. The effects would be larger than the historic ones because most of the cumulative Dutch subsidence and peat loss was accomplished with much less efficient techniques than those available now.

AB To evaluate the impact of environmental factors on the occurrence of environmental mycobacteria, viable counts of mycobacteria were measured in samples of brook water collected from 53 drainage areas located in a linear belt crossing Finland at 63-degrees north latitude. The numbers of mycobacteria were correlated with characteristics of the drainage area, climatic parameters, chemical and physical characteristics of the water, and counts of other heterotrophic bacteria in the water. The numbers of mycobacteria in the water ranged from 10 to 2,200 CFU/liter. The counts correlated positively (P < 0.001) with the presence of peatlands, precipitation data, chemical oxygen demand, water color, and concentrations of Fe, Al, Cu, Co, and Cr. The mycobacterial counts correlated negatively (P < 0.001) with water pH, whereas other heterotrophic bacterial counts lacked any correlation with pH. A linear regression model with four independent variables (i.e., peatlands in the drainage area, chemical oxygen demand, concentration of potassium, and pH) explained 83% of the variation in mycobacterial counts in brook waters. Our results suggest that acidification may enhance the growth of environmental mycobacteria.

AB Soil scarification is one of the main methods for enhancing natural regeneration and it is widely used before seeding and planting as well. The aim of this research was to assess the effect of soil scarification on natural regeneration in the 11-year-old forest regeneration areas in fertile mineral soil and peatland sites. After clear-cutting, these areas were disc-trenched with Donaren 190 and inventoried after the first growing season. The inventory was performed using rectangular sample plots ranging in size from 10x10 to 15x20 m. The number of all woody plants was determined by microsites untreated area, furrow, slope, and ridge. The same inventory was redone 11 growing seasons later.
   After 11 growth years, a large number of Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) was found in Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Oxalis site types and drained peatlands, with 2,600-5,300 trees per hectare. The number of pine plants on microsites on mineral soil was the greatest in furrows and on slopes (33.5% and 30.4%), and on peat soil on slopes and in untreated areas (38.3% and 52.1%). The number of naturally regenerated Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) trees was the largest in Oxalis-Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium myrtillus and Oxalis site types, with 2,000 3,000 plants per hectare. With regard to microsites, spruce plants were the most abundant in untreated areas and in furrows on mineral soil (23.2% and 34.6%) and in untreated areas and on slopes on peat soil (54.3% and 37.0%). Among deciduous trees, birches (Betula pendula Roth., Betula pubecens Ehrh.) and aspens (Populus tremula L.) as well as other deciduous trees (Salix sp. L., Tilia cordata L., Alnus sp L.. Sorbus aucuparia L., Prunus padus L., Fraxinus excelsior L.) were mostly growing in untreated areas on both mineral and peat soil. Soil scarification increased consistently the number of conifer seedlings in the sites typical of Norway spruce and Scots pine (p<0.05), where no effect was detected in the number of deciduous saplings.

AB A paleolimnological record from the central Messenian plain (southwestern Peloponnese, southern Greece) indicates rapid changes in the water level and chemistry of a transient lake on the flanks of the Taygetos Mountains during the last c. 6000years. The analyses are based on diatoms as well as carbon and nitrogen isotopes from bulk sediments in a 7.5-m-long sediment core retrieved from the drained fen of Agios Floros, at the northern banks of the ancient River Pamisos. The sequence consists of fen peat in the uppermost section underlain by lacustrine sediments, which are punctuated by two layers of clay with diatomaceous silt bands. High accumulation rate is recorded in the oldest part of the section (up to 23mm/yr), particularly during two decadal-long periods centered at c. 5700 and c. 5300 cal. BP. The diatom record reveals pronounced peaks in the planktonic taxon Cyclotella distinguenda, which correspond to the laminated sequences, reflecting the rapid development of a deep lake with an open water environment during these two time periods. Another two events with intermediate water levels are inferred at c. 5200 and c. 4600 cal. BP. These short-lived phases were probably, to a large extent, caused by local tectonic processes and the consequent hydrological anomalies of the nearby karst springs, although abrupt climatic changes with enhanced precipitation might have also played a role. At c. 4500 cal. BP, our data suggest the development of terrestrial conditions in this area, which can be attributed to the decreasing activity/dry up of springs, probably associated with more arid climate. After c. 2500 cal. BP, the diatom record infers a return to wetter conditions, probably as a response to more humid climate with marked seasonality and human activities, developing the present-day environment with cultivated and seasonally semi-flooded fields.

DT Article
AB The onset of peat accumulation in the Hot Weather Creek area (79-degrees-58'N-84-degrees-28'W) followed the postglacial marine emergence of the region. The physiographic context of the studied Holocene deposit suggests that peat initially accumulated in a depression south of early Ridge Lake. Polygons subsequently formed in that peat deposit. The draining of the lake took place as a result of downcutting of the deposit by the lake spillway. At the base of the 2.85 m sequence, macrofossil analysis reveals an open meadow dominated by grasses and sedges recording a pioneer stage that followed emersion. The physionomy of this meadow was subsequently modified by the formation of a low-centred polygon. Bryophytes colonized the resulting wet depression and a peat deposit developed. A series of mineral horizons occur throughout the deposit, indicating recurrent aeolian or alluvial activity during peat accumulation. These layers are associated with higher rates of peat decomposition.

AB The mapping and monitoring of Swiss mires has so far relied on a classification system based on expert judgement, which was not supported by a quantitative vegetation analysis and which did not include all wetland vegetation types described in the country. Based on a spatially representative sample of 17,608 relev,s from 112 Swiss mires, we address the following questions: (1) How abundant are wetland vegetation types (phytosociological alliances) in Swiss mires? (2) How are they distributed across the country--is there a regional pattern? (3) How clearly are they separated from each other? (4) How clear and reliable is their ecological interpretation? Using published wetland vegetation relev,s and lists of diagnostic species for phytosociological units (associations and alliances) established by experts, we developed a numerical method for assigning relev,s to units through the calculation of similarity indices. We applied this method to our sample of 17,608 relev,s and estimated the total area covered by each vegetation type in Switzerland. We found that vegetation types not included in previous mapping were either rare in Switzerland (partly due to mire drainage) or poorly distinguished from other vegetation units. In an ordination, the Swiss mire vegetation formed a triangular gradient system with the Sphagnion medii, the Caricion davallianae and the Phragmition australis as extreme types. Phytosociological alliances were clearly separated in a subset of 2,265 relev,s, which had a strong similarity to one particular association, but poorly separated across all relev,s, of which many could not be unequivocally assigned to one association. However, ecological gradients were reflected equally well by the vegetation types in either case. Overall, phytosociological alliances distinguished until now proved suitable schemes to describe and interpret vegetation gradients. Nevertheless, we see the urgent need to establish a data base of Swiss wetland relev,s for a more reliable definition of some vegetation units.

TI Angling for the "Powte": a Jacobean Environmental Protest Poem
SO ENGLISH LITERARY RENAISSANCE
LA English
DT Article
AB In his monumental 1662 history of the drainage of the fens, the antiquarian William Dugdale reports that outraged locals composed libellous songs to protest the theft of their commons. Preserving a rare specimen of this genre, Dugdale printed an anonymous ballad entitled The Powtes Complaint. The song adopts a non-human point of view to bewail the destruction of both the wetlands ecology and the fen-dwellers' economy. This essay examines four different manuscripts of the ballad in the British Library, documenting their variants and commenting on their significance. It also seeks for answers to some pressing questions: when was the song written and where? What did it sound like? What socio-historical and environmental circumstances prompted its composition? How does the ballad portray the fenland ecology, and how does it compare with other seventeenth-century literary representations of the fens? What exactly is a pout? What is the nature of its complaint? And who was the person behind the song? [T.A.B. and C.E.]

AB Post-mining peaty lands were formed as a result of peat extraction on drainage wetlands areas. After peat extraction has finished, the biggest problem is to use these lands for other purposes. This type of soil is very heterogenic, poorly drained, with massive structure and poor contents of nutrients. Thus it is very problematic to grow traditional agricultural crops that have special requirements for soil fertility on those areas. The area of post-mining peaty lands in Belarus alone is about 200 000 hectares. One of the perspective directions of post-mining peaty land use is re-wetting and production of biomass for energy purposes. The goal of our research was to estimate cost of biomass of natural grass and willow wood from short rotation coppice (SRC) plantations which may be used as feedstock for pellet production. The dominant wetland species were common reed, cattail and sedges. SRC plantation was planted on degraded soils. The prime cost of biomass which was produced on the base of natural grass was from 10.4 euro per ton to 13.2 euro per ton, depending on technology. The prime cost of willow biomass was 24.1 euro per ton. Introduction of taxes will increase cost of biomass by approximately 60 %. The calculation of economic efficiency identified that biomass as a feedstock for pellet production on post-peat mining areas may be a profitable direction for peat factory function and providing the sustainable development of local communities. Additional profit may be obtained as a result of saving carbon quotas. The share of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel for grass biomass production is about 2 % from the total volume of CO2 during renewable biomass utilization for energy and for chips production from willow wood - 6 %. The diversification of biomass sources enables to use feedstock for a pellet line in the winter and spring which is in the heating season.

AB Bioenergy crop cultivation on former peat extraction areas is a potential after-use option that provides a source of renewable energy while mitigating climate change through enhanced carbon (C) sequestration. This study investigated the full C and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of fertilized (RCG-F) and nonfertilized (RCG-C) reed canary grass (RCG; Phalaris arundinacea) cultivation compared to bare peat (BP) soil within an abandoned peat extraction area in western Estonia during a dry year. Vegetation sampling, static chamber and lysimeter measurements were carried out to estimate above- and belowground biomass production and allocation, fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in cultivated strips and drainage ditches as well as the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export, respectively. Heterotrophic respiration was determined from vegetation-free trenched plots. Fertilization increased the above- to belowground biomass production ratio and the autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration ratio. The full C balance (incl. CO2, CH4 and DOC fluxes from strips and ditches) was 96, 215 and 180g Cm(-2)yr(-1) in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively, suggesting that all treatments acted as C sources during the dry year. The C balance was driven by variations in the net CO2 exchange, whereas the combined contribution of CH4 and DOC fluxes was <5%. The GHG balances were 3.6, 7.9 and 6.6t CO2 eqha(-1)yr(-1) in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively. The CO2 exchange was also the dominant component of the GHG balance, while the contributions of CH4 and N2O were <1% and 1-6%, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that maximizing plant growth and the associated CO2 uptake through adequate water and nutrient supply is a key prerequisite for ensuring sustainable high yields and climate benefits in RCG cultivations established on organic soils following drainage and peat extraction.

AB Most wetlands in the central European lowlands have been severely altered by cultivation. As a consequence they no longer fulfil their function as habitats for specialised species and communities, nor as retention areas for water and solid materials. Therefore, a number of renaturation experiments are in progress, which intend to develop and test strategies and measures to improve this defect in landscape diversity. For this purpose experiments on re-wetting, nutrient depletion of eutrophicated areas and re-establishment of typical wetland plant species and phytocoenoses have been performed. An ecological development concept defining the aims and describing their feasibility precedes such experiments. Preliminary results indicate that the reconstruction of the former state (regeneration) is impossible within reasonable time spans. In drained raised bogs overgrown with heather, as well as in those which have been industrially exploited, the primary aim must always be to restore efficient peat formation as far as possible; as a rule one succeeds only with well-growing and nutrient-demanding fen and transitional bog species. In cultivated fens the aim is to reduce peat loss. As a first step this is accomplished by converting arable fields and sown meadows into permanent grassland, if possible with reduced fertilization and low mowing or grazing frequencies, and accompanied by rewetting during winter. Many experiments have sought to impoverish eutrophicated fen soils and introduce typical fen species by sowing or planting, so well tested techniques are available. However, the total prevention of peat loss is only possible by permanent rewetting throughout the year, so that peat accumulation can start again. Only in this way could fens regain their former function as sinks in landscape processes.

AB Year-round flooding can be a cost-effective measure for rewetting highly degraded fens, and is gaining popularity for lowland fen restoration in Europe. We investigated the short-term effects of such permanent inundation on species composition and spatial distribution of the vegetation of a formerly drained coastal fen, and addressed the question of whether re-establishment of peat-forming reed vegetation is foreseeable. For vegetation mapping and monitoring we combined permanent plot data acquired during four years following shallow flooding, high-resolution aerial imagery and an elevation model. Five vegetation types were distinguished, and we analysed their spatial distribution and succession patterns throughout the years. Preexisting vegetation, its spatial arrangement and the water level played major roles in secondary succession. Existing patches of Phragmites australis showed high stability, but their growth was not consistent through the years and at all inundation depths. Existing stands of Bolboschoenus maritimus were outcompeted by Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani or vanished and formed relatively stable ponds of open water with hydrophytic species. We concluded that the expansion of reed as peat-forming vegetation is likely to proceed slowly, but fluctuations in water level and edge effects will probably maintain a persistent mosaic of vegetation and open water in the near future.

AB Pine tree substrates (PTSs) may provide growers with sustainable substrate component options. Improved processing of PTS components has provided new materials with little scientific evaluation or understanding of their hydrophysical behavior and properties. Moisture retention characteristics were developed for two PTSs and four traditional greenhouse components: sphagnum peat, coconut coir, perlite, pine bark, shredded-pine-wood (SPW), and pine-wood-chips (PWC). Mixtures of peat containing 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of perlite, SPW, or PWC were also characterized. Hydrophysical properties were measured, allowing for comparison of the PTS components to the more traditional substrate components (peat, coir, perlite, and pine bark). The SPW was constructed to retain water similarly to peat and pine bark, whereas the PWC was made to increase drainage like perlite. Shredded pine wood had higher total porosity and more easily available water than did PWC components. Total porosities of SPW and PWC were similar to pine bark and coir; air space and drainage were higher than peat and coir because of the lower percentage of fine particles in the PTS components. The two PTS components had a greater influence on water drainage and retention dynamics than did perlite when amended with peat as an aggregate. Water release patterns of SPW or PWC components at low tensions were lower than peat and greater than pine bark; drainage was similar to perlite at higher tensions. Equilibrium capacity variable models predicted similar physical properties (and trends) across multiple container sizes for peat mixes amended with perlite, SPW, or PWC. The impact of PWC on drainage and aeration was similar to perlite in all containers, but these effects were greater in smaller containers.

AB Fire has considerable impact on vegetation and organic soils properties. As we observed that the differences between vegetation of burnt and unburnt areas on the rich fen are visible 11 years after the fire, we assumed that the post-fire changes are long lasting, yet limited exclusively to the burnt areas. In order to check this hypothesis we studied spatial differentiation of physical and chemical properties of soils, and productivity capacities of burnt and unburnt areas in the fen in Biebrza National Park. We took soil samples from the neighboring burnt and unburnt areas, from the depth of 0-30 cm and 30-50 cm. We analyzed 21 parameters of the soils including: pH, ash content, moisture, bulk density, exchangeable K,Na, Ca, available P, N-NH4+, N-NO3-, total N, C, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, P; and calculated C: N, C: P ratios. Surface layer of the burnt soils differed significantly from the unburnt soils in respect of 17 out of 21 parameters. The most pronounced difference was observed for available phosphorous (on average 6 times higher for the burnt soils). The differences in the deeper layer were mostly insignificant. The burnt areas were also characterized by twofold higher plant productivity than recorded for the unburnt areas. The influence of fire on peaty soils was long lasting but mostly limited to the surface layer of the soils. In the case of particular soil features, the post-fire differences were modified by advanced muck formation (moorshing) processes in the unburnt areas. Since the fire led to long lasting increase of fertility, the recovery of fen vegetation is unlikely.

DE Beaver (Castor fiber); mire ontogenesis; prehistoric clearance;

ID HOLOCENE
AB Excavation of the relict stratigraphy of a drained, agriculturally reclaimed mire in Lancashire, northwest England, has revealed evidence for prehistoric (i.e., c. 820-520 cal. sc) beaver activity in the form of gnawed timber stratified in the, basal sediments. The lowest horizons of the peat deposits contained the intact root systems of a dense hazel wood, indicating that the mire probably owed its origins to the rapid flooding of a relatively dry landscape. The exact cause of this inundation remains uncertain, although beaver damming is a strong candidate. The possibility that beaver activity is implicated in the flooding of the site is potentially of great significance both pataeoecologically and archaeologically. The site may represent the first recorded example in British prehistory of a non-human animal playing a role in inducing mire development. It also adds weight to the possibility that some small-scale woodland clearances identified in British pollen diagrams (which have been attributed to anthropogenic activity) may be due to the effects of beaver.

In the Canadian System of Soil Classification, the Organic order represents those soils that have developed from materials that are comprised primarily of plant tissue remains and includes both wetland Organic soils and upland Organic soils. This review focuses on the first group; the latter group is discussed in Fox and Tarnocai (2011). Wetland Organic soils can be subdivided into three great groups: Fibrisol, Mesisol, and Humisol, reflecting the degree of decomposition of organic material and the vertical arrangement of different organic horizons and other horizons. Wetland Organic soils are present in all regions of Canada and are commonly referred to as (unfrozen) peatland soils. Unfrozen peatlands with Organic soils cover approximately 75 5568 km(2) (8.4%) of the land area of Canada. The two primary processes of formation of wetland Organic soils are paludification and terrestrialization. The major taxonomic issues identified for the wetland Organic soils concerns the lack of taxonomic protocols for limnic materials within the soil control section. This is an issue for those soil profiles in which the middle tier is dominated by, if not entirely composed of, deposited limnic materials. Further work is required to determine if these issues should be expressed at the great group or subgroup level of classification. Our understanding of the effects of management practices such as cultivation, tree removal, drainage, and peat extraction on soil properties needs to be translated into models of soil development.

AB Peatlands and peaty riparian zones are major sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM), but are poorly understood in terms of export dynamics and controls thereof. Thereby quality of DOM affects function and behavior of DOM in aquatic ecosystems, but DOM quality can also help to track DOM sources and their export dynamics under specific hydrologic preconditions. The objective of this study was to elucidate controls on temporal variability in DOM concentration and quality in stream water draining a bog and a forested peaty riparian zone, particularly considering drought and storm flow events. DOM quality was monitored using spectrofluorometric indices for aromaticity (SUVA(254)), apparent molecular size (S-R) and precursor organic material (FI), as well as PARAFAC modeling of excitation emission matrices (EEMs).
   Indices for DOM quality exhibited major changes due to different hydrologic conditions, but patterns were also dependent on season. Stream water at the forested site with mineral, peaty soils generally exhibited higher variability in DOM concentrations and quality compared to the outflow of an ombrotrophic bog, where DOM was less susceptible to changes in hydrologic conditions. During snowmelt and spring events, near-surface protein-like DOM pools were exported. A microbial DOM fraction originating from ground-water and deep peat layers was increasing during drought, while a strongly microbially altered DOM fraction was also exported by discharge events with dry preconditions at the forested site. This might be due to accelerated microbial activity in the peaty riparian zone of the forested site under these preconditions. Our study demonstrated that DOM ex-port dynamics are not only a passive mixing of different hydrological sources, but monitoring studies have to consider that DOM quality depends on hydrologic preconditions and season. Moreover, the forested peaty riparian zone generated the most variability in headwater DOM quantity and quality, as could be tracked by the used spectrofluorometric indices.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), a major greenhouse gas and ozone depleter, is emitted from drained organic soils typically developed in floodplains. We investigated the effect of the water table depth and soil oxygen (O-2) content on N2O fluxes and their nitrogen isotope composition in a drained floodplain fen in Estonia. Measurements were done at natural water table depth, and we created a temporary anoxic environment by experimental flooding. From the suboxic peat (0.5-6 mg O-2/L) N2O emissions peaked at 6 mg O-2/L and afterwards decreased with decreasing O-2. From the anoxic and oxic peat (0 and >6 mg O-2/L, respectively) N2O emissions were low. Under anoxic conditions the delta N-15/delta N-14 ratio of the top 10 cm peat layer was low, gradually decreasing to 30 cm. In the suboxic peat, delta N-15/delta N-14 ratios increased with depth. In samples of peat fluctuating between suboxic and anoxic, the elevated N-15/N-14 ratios (delta N-15 = 7-9 parts per thousand. ambient N-2) indicated intensive microbial processing of nitrogen. Low values of site preference (SP; difference between the central and peripheral N-15 atoms) and delta O-18-N2O in the captured gas samples indicate nitrifier denitrification in the floodplain fen.

AB Regional variations in the concentrations of DOM were studied in running waters in central-northern Sweden. The highest concentrations occurred in the coastal areas, and there was a marked trend with decreasing concentrations towards the inland and the mountain range further west. Explanation of these differences are regional differences in forestland productivity, the occurrence and type of peatlands, annual runoff patterns and soil drainage conditions. Anthropogenic factors, such as atmospheric deposition of acids and forestry, have probably not contributed to the regional differences.

AB Woodland key habitats (WKHs) form a network of local biodiversity hotspots in human-dominated landscapes of northern Europe. They have been designated based on the presence of old-growth species and structures, and are considered to indicate long-term forest cover. To test whether WKHs do particularly occur in continuous forest land and to explore the scale dependence of relationships between WKH presence and their historical and environmental properties, we analysed them at five spatial scales (from stand to landscape: 80-2500 m) and referring to four reference years (1790, 1860, 1910, and 2010) using univariate and multivariate analyses. We upscaled the georeferenced data using a moving window approach. The study area encompassed 94,886 contiguous forest stands in a boreo-nemoral region of southern Latvia (5178 km(2)) with a relatively short history of intensive land use. At the scale of stands, the presence of WKHs, ranging from 0.1 to 59 ha in size, best corresponded to highly variable land-use histories 100-220 years ago such as natural succession on abandoned land, drained bogs and wetlands, and only partly to continuous forest cover for more than 220 years. We identified short-term (50-70 years) and small-scale (up to 250 m) gaps in past forest cover as significant positive predictors of WKH presence, which resemble patterns caused by natural disturbances. At broader scales (800-2500 m), best explanatory variables were the presence of old forest fragments throughout the landscape, at least 100 years of continuous forest cover, changes in forest cover, i.e., afforestation, between 1790 and 1860, and the proximity to bogs and rivers. We also found that correlations between WKH presence and forest patch density converted from negative coefficients at small spatio-temporal scales to positive ones at broader spatio-temporal scales. Our results highlight the importance of using multi-scale information on land-use history to improve both the understanding and the management of biodiversity in cultural landscapes. In brief, instead of long-term continuous forest cover, we found a surprisingly diverse and dynamic land-use history in places that have been designated as WKHs.

AB Iron is a restrictive element for primary productivity in the oceans. The influence of dissolved organic matters as metal chelators on the bio-available iron input to the ocean has been widely reported. However, natural dissolved organic matters, especially the phenolics originated from peatlands and geochemical interactions with iron remains poorly understood. In this study, solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography experiments were conducted to determine the vertical distributions of phenolic acids in different peat layers in Hani Peatland, China. Ten phenolic acids, including protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, gentisic acid, caffeic acid, etc. were detected. Simulation experiments of phenolics-Fe interactions under alkaline conditions (pH = 8.0 +/- 0.1) indicated phenolic acids bearing either catechol or galloyl groups (such as protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid and gallic acid) could chelate iron to produce relatively stable phenolics-Fe complexes and therefore help to weaken its precipitation in the oxidative condition. In addition, the simulation experiments with artificial coastal waters demonstrated that this complexation could ensure that at least 25 % of the initial Fe load dissolve in coastal water, implying large part of dissolved iron in rivers draining from peatlands could be transported through the estuarine zones. Considering the wide distribution of peatlands globally, the higher concentration of Fe in peatlands, and the enhancement of marine organisms by Fe, the geochemical interactions between iron and phenolics originated from peatlands are of important significance to transport bio-available iron from terrestrial system to oceans.

AB Water passing through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta contains elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and trihalomethane (THM) precursor relative to upstream waters from the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River. Drainage from agricultural peat soils has been identified as one of the major sources of DOC and THM precursor. A series of controlled laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate abiotic and biotic effects on the quantity and the nature of DOC and THM precursors produced from oxidized surface and reduced subsurface soils in the Delta. For abiotic effects, DOC was extracted from both soils with synthetic solutions containing a range of salinity (0-4dS/m) and sodicity (0 to infinity). The results showed that an increase in salinity significantly decreased the concentration of DOC in the soil-water from both soils but increased its aromaticity, as indicated by specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA). For biotic effects, peat soils were incubated over a range of temperatures (10degreesC, 20degreesC and 30degreesC) and soil moisture contents (0.3-10g water/g soil). After 8 weeks of incubation, only extracted DOC from flooded conditions and flooded and non-flooded cycles showed an increase in DOC. These findings indicate that neither salinity nor sodicity is the major factor for DOC production, but both can affect the solubility and mobility of DOC in the Delta soils. We believe wetting processes in oxidized peat soils produce significant amounts of DOC found in agricultural drainage discharged into the Delta waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE drainage; golf green construction; soil modification
AB Where coarse-textured materials, such as gravel, underlie the root-zone layer of sports turf soil profiles, mater retention in the root-zone layer is increased. The objective of this research was to determine the water retention characteristics in sand and sand : peat mixtures placed over coarse-textured layers and to determine how sand particle size and type of peat in the mixtures influenced water distribution after drainage. Soil profiles consisted of 30 cm of sand or sand : peat mixtures over 5 cm of predominantly coarse and very coarse sand, which in turn was over 10 cm of gravel. Excess water was added to the profile and allowed to drain for 24 or 48 h, following which water content and air-filled porosity (AFP) in the mixtures were evaluated. Regardless of the root-zone mixture, the coarse-textured sublayers resulted in a wet zone in the lower portion of the root-zone mixture. An unamended, predominantly medium and coarse sand, when used in the 30-cm root-zone layer, maintained approximate to 10% AFP in the lower 6 cm after drainage. Sand : peat mixtures using this sand generally maintained 3% to 8% AFP in the lower 12 cm of the root-zone layer. An unamended, predominantly fine and medium sand root-zone layer had approximate to 6% AFP in the lower 9 cm and sand : peat mixtures using this sand had <5% AFP in the lower 12 to 18 cm of the root-zone layer, with significant portions remaining at or near saturation after 24 or 48 h of drainage.

AB Sphagnum biomass is a promising material that could be used as a substitute for peat in growing media and can be sustainably produced by converting existing drainage-based peatland agriculture into wet, climate-friendly agriculture (paludiculture). Our study focuses on yield maximization of Sphagnum as a crop.
   We tested the effects of three water level regimes and of phosphorus or potassium fertilization on the growth of four Sphagnum species (S. papillosum, S. palustre, S. fimbriatum, S. fallax). To simulate field conditions in Central and Western Europe we carried out a glasshouse experiment under nitrogen-saturated conditions.
   A constant high water table (remaining at 2 cm below capitulum during growth) led to highest productivity for all tested species. Water table fluctuations between 2 and 9 cm below capitulum during growth and a water level 2 cm below capitulum at the start but falling relatively during plant growth led to significantly lower productivity. Fertilization had no effect on Sphagnum growth under conditions with high atmospheric deposition such as in NW Germany (38 kg N, 0.3 kg P, 7.6 kg K center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1)).
   Large-scale maximization of Sphagnum yields requires precise water management, with water tables just below the capitula and rising with Sphagnum growth. The nutrient load in large areas of Central and Western Europe from atmospheric deposition and irrigation water is high but, with an optimal water supply, does not hamper Sphagnum growth, at least not of regional provenances of Sphagnum.

AB Headwater stream ecosystems draining blanket peat-dominated catchments occur in many high-latitude river systems. These systems are thought to be very sensitive to threats from climate change, and land-use modification including artificial drainage, overgrazing, afforestation and vegetation burning. This study examined ten peatland streams in the headwaters of the River Tees to examine spatial and seasonal patterns of instream physicochemical variables and benthic macroinvertebrate communities across the stream network. Principle component analysis revealed significant positive relationships between catchment size and electrical conductivity, sulfate concentration, pH and median bed sediment size, and negative relationships with suspended sediment and aluminium concentrations. Seasonal variability was particularly evident in stream water temperature, benthic particulate organic matter and nitrate and chloride concentrations. Macroinvertebrate community abundance and diversity were typically similar across streams, but redundancy analysis demonstrated turnover of macroinvertebrate assemblages with increases in stream size. In particular, first-and second-order streams hosted small-sized stoneflies such as Amphinemura standfussi and Nemoura cambrica, while larger streams (third-and fourth-order) supported more mayflies and larger predatory stoneflies (e. g. Dinocras cephalotes and Perla bipunctata). Many environmental drivers of ecological patterns appear to work in synergy in peatland headwater streams, and controlled experiments may be necessary to disentangle some of the variables to guide effective conservation and management strategies in impacted peatland river systems.

   REINTRODUCTION
AB The moss layer transfer technique has been used since the 1990s to restore bogs in North America after peat extraction. This article assesses the influence of drainage-related, peat physicochemical, meteorological, management and landscape factors on the vegetation of extracted peatlands that have been restored in this manner. It draws upon data from a unique long-term monitoring programme covering 53 restoration projects spanning 600 km across eastern Canada. The time since restoration ranged from 3 to 15 years, and the rehabilitated peatlands had on average three permanent plots where vegetation was recorded every two years. Overall, the study included 246 permanent plots and 946 observations (plots*year of survey). Redundancy and cluster analyses showed that successful restoration, defined by the dominance of a Sphagnum carpet (54% of all plots at the most recent observation), was mainly associated with effective blocking of the former secondary drainage network within the restored sector, while plots dominated by bare peat (24% of all plots) occurred more often if a hot summer followed restoration works and where higher proportions of the surrounding land were subject to peat extraction. Management decisions, such as the season when restoration work was carried out, also substantially influenced restoration outcomes. For example, restoring in spring increased the likelihood of initiating an alternative successional trajectory characterised by dominance of the pioneer moss Polytrichum strictum (22% of all plots). However, a tendency towards Sphagnum colonisation and the development of Sphagnum carpets was observed over time in practically all plots. These results will inform future restoration efforts using the moss layer transfer as a peatland restoration method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Replicate intact peat turf microcosms from nine sites along a nitrogen (N) pollution gradient in Great Britain, from Strathvaich in North-West Scotland to Hatfield Moor in the English Midlands, have been subjected to simulated precipitation for 18 months in an unheated glasshouse in Aberdeen. The rainfall applied to each turf had a composition based upon that of rainfall at the UK Department of the Environment(DOE) monitoring sites adjacent to the locations from which the turfs were collected. After an initial 6-month equilibration, drainage water was calculated by difference. Annual N fluxes in the three forms were then calculated. At low to moderate NO3- inputs, NO3- was largely retained in the plant soil system, but at higher NO3- inputs, NO3- leaching occurred. Except at the two most polluted sites, NH4+ leaching exceeded NH4+ input. To a first approximation, leached organic N increased linearly with N input, although at higher N inputs, organic N accumulation apparently became relatively more important. Only at very high N deposition rates do the peats appear to be acidifying as a consequence of N deposition.

AB The globally widespread drainage of peatlands has often been shown to lead to increased concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streams and rivers. Elevated DOC concentrations have implications for carbon cycling, ecosystem functioning, and potable water treatment. Peatland rewetting, principally through ditch blocking, is often carried out with the expectation that this will reduce DOC concentrations. Uncertainty still remains as to whether drainage, or its reversal via ditch blocking, will also lead to changes in the molecular composition of DOC/dissolved organic matter (DOM), which have the potential to affect downstream processing and treatability of U.K. drinking water supplies. To investigate this question, we used a replicated experiment consisting of 12 parallel ditches on an upland bog and took samples of ditch water, pore water, and overland flow water for 4 years. After a brief preblocking baseline period, eight ditches were blocked using two methods. A complementary suite of optical metrics, chemical measurements, and analytical techniques revealed that ditch blocking had no consistent effect on DOM quality, up to 4 years after blocking. Where significant differences were found, effect size calculations demonstrated that these differences were small and would therefore have minimal impact upon water treatability. Furthermore, some differences between ditches were evident before blocking took place, highlighting the need for robust baseline monitoring before intervention. Based on our results from a hillslope-scale experiment, we were unable to identify clear evidence that peatland ditch blocking will deliver benefits in terms of DOM treatability in potable water supplies, although we also did not find any evidence of short-term deterioration in water quality during the restoration period. We conclude that, although peatland restoration can be expected to deliver other benefits such as reduced carbon loss and enhanced biodiversity, it is doubtful whether it will lead to improvements in drinking water treatability.

AB In Finland, ditch network maintenance (DNM) is carried out annually on 60-70,000 ha of drained peatland to promote tree growth for forestry purposes. However, it is important to avoid ditching that contributes little to the stand growth and productivity, both to improve the economical profitability of forestry and to mitigate DNM-induced nutrient release to watercourses.
   We hypothesised that mature forest stands with substantial evapotranspiration potential do not necessarily need DNM, even if the ditch networks are in poor condition. We estimated evapotranspiration (EVT) of forest vegetation during the growing seasons (June-September) of 2007-2011 in four forested artificial peatland catchments dominated by Scots pine stands (Pinus sylvestris L.) (stand volume 93-151 m(3) ha(-1)) located in southern, western, central and northern Finland. Precipitation (P), runoff (R) and water table level (WTL) were monitored continuously in the field. The water storage change (Delta S) was estimated on the basis of WTL measurements and peat pF curves determined from in situ peat samples. In addition, tree stand transpiration (T) was estimated in two of the catchments using the sap flow method. EVT was estimated as the residual term of the water balance equation.
   During the growing season, EVT (153-295 mm) was 49-161 % of the total accumulated P (155-368 mm), and decreased from south to north. Within each growing season, EVT was always largest in July or August. Tree transpiration was about 50 % of the total forest EVT in the two sites where it was measured directly. The mean WTL was at depth 36-63 cm during the growing seasons. Clear-cutting of a 100m(3) ha(-1) stand on one site resulted in an average rise of WTL by 18 cm.
   The results suggested that, in the southernmost site in particular, no drainage network management would be necessary to sustain satisfactory drainage conditions for tree growth because growing-season precipitation is transferred back to the atmosphere by forest EVT. In the northernmost site, ditch networks were considered important in controlling drainage conditions because of the low EVT potential of <100 m(3) ha(-1) tree stands. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind forest EVT potential, as one site with high tree stand volume had surprisingly low EVT potential.

AB This study investigated the physicochemical forms of dissolved iron in the coastal plume (salinity = 28-35) of a small river draining a peat-rich catchment. Speciation information was obtained through a combination of fractionation by crossflow filtration (CFF) along with voltammetric detection of either naturally occurring iron-humic complexes (July survey) or known, synthetic complexes (September survey) formed by titrating the samples with the competing ligand 2-(2-thiazolylazo)-p-cresol (TAC). The majority of colloidal iron (>5000 Da) was present as iron-humic complexes supplied by the river and showing uniform conditional stability constants throughout the plume (log K'(Fe'HS) 11.3 +/- 0.1, i.e. log KFe3+HS = 21.3 +/- 0.1). Noncolloidal or soluble iron was strongly complexed to ligands of marine origin with log K'(Fe'HS) = 11.9 +/- 0.1. Equilibrium of the total iron pool with the added TAC ligand was achieved in all but the highest salinity sample, albeit more slowly for colloidal than for soluble iron. In addition, measurements of humiclike fluorescence suggested that the conformation of colloids could change over time as a result of dissociation of the iron-humic associations. These results are consistent with the concept that iron in coastal waters is strongly but reversibly bound to humic substances and therefore may be available for complexation by siderophore-type ligands released by microorganisms.

AB Land use change and land management practices affect the net emissions of the trace gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon sources and sinks. Changes in CH4 and N2O emissions can substantially alter the overall greenhouse gas balance of a system. Drainage of peatlands for agriculture or forestry generally increases N2O emission as well as that of CO2, but also decreases CH4 emission. Intermittent drainage. or late flooding of rice paddies can greatly diminish the seasonal emission of CH4 compared with continuous flooding. Changes in N2O emissions following land use change from forest or grassland to agriculture vary between climatic zones, and the net impact varies with time. In many soils, the increase in carbon sequestration by adopting no-till systems may be largely negated by associated increases in N2O emission. The promotion of carbon credits for the no-till system before we have better quantification of its net greenhouse gas balance is naive. Applying nitrogen fertilizers to forests could increase the forest carbon sink, but may be accompanied by a net increase in N2O; conversely, adding lime to acid forest soils can decrease the N2O emission.

AB Peatlands in Australia and New Zealand are composed mainly of Restionaceous and Cyperaceous peats, although Sphagnum peat is common in wetter climates (Mean Annual Precipitation > 1,000mm) and at higher altitudes (> 1,000m). Experimental trials in two contrasting peatland typesfire-damaged Sphagnum peatlands in the Australian Alps and cutover restiad bogs in lowland New Zealandrevealed similar approaches to peatland restoration. Hydrological restoration and rehydration of drying peats involved blocking drainage ditches to raise water tables or, additionally in burnt Sphagnum peatlands, peat-trenching, and the use of sterilized straw bales to form semipermanent dam walls and barriers to spread and slow surface water movement. Recovery to the predisturbance vegetation community was most successful once protective microclimates had been established, either artificially or naturally. Specifically, horizontally laid shadecloth resulted in Sphagnum cristatum regeneration rates and biomass production 3-4 times that of unshaded vegetation (Australia), and early successional nurse shrubs facilitated establishment of Sporadanthus ferrugineus (New Zealand) within 2-3 years. On severely burnt or cutover sites, a patch dynamic approach using transplants of Sphagnum or creation of restiad peat islands markedly improved vegetation recovery. In New Zealand, this approach has been scaled up to whole mine-site restoration, in which the newly vegetated islands provide habitat and seed sources for plants and invertebrates to spread onto surrounding areas. Although a vegetation cover can be established relatively rapidly in both peatland types, restoration of invertebrate communities, ecosystem processes, and peat hydrological function and accumulation may take many decades.

AB The article provides data on distribution, biological features, long-term population dynamics and modern conditions of the heath butterfly Coenonympha oedippus (Fabricius, 1787) on the territory of Belorussia. In the Belorussian Polesie region, there is quite dense network of large settlements of this species on large bog massifs. The species is very sensitive to overgrowing of the habitats by bushes and reeds caused by the drop of the groundwater level in the bogs due to the water drainage by land reclamation systems and the climate warming. The overgrowing of the bogs has significantly accelerated in the last decades when they have been no longer used for mowing. In the same time, the fight against bogs bushing by burning vegetation and mechanized mowing is a concern for the well-being of the settlements of C. oedippus.

AB Fluvial organic carbon (OC) transformations are an important component of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas production in inland waters resulting in considerable recent interest in the fate of fluvial OC exported from carbon rich soils such as peatlands. Additionally, peatland catchments are important drinking water collection areas, where high OC concentrations in runoff have water treatment implications. This analysis presents the results from a year-round intensive study within a water treatment catchment draining an area of peatland, considering carbon transformations along a continuum from headwater river, through a storage reservoir and pipe, to a water treatment works. The study uses a unique combination of methods (colourmetric, ultrafiltration, and C-14 radiocarbon dating) to assess catchment wide changes in fluvial carbon composition (colour, size, and age) alongside concentration measures. The results indicate clear patterns of carbon transformations in the river and reservoir and dissolved low molecular weight coloured carbon to be most subject to change, with both loss and replacement within the catchment residence time. Although the evidence suggests dissolved OC (DOC) gains are from particulate OC breakdown, the mechanisms of DOC loss are less certain and may represent greenhouse gas losses or conversions to particulate OC. The transformations presented here appear to have minimal impact on the amount of harder to treat (<10kDa) dissolved carbon, although they do have implications for total DOC loading to water treatment works. This paper shows that peatland fluvial systems are not passive receptors of particulate and dissolved organic carbon but locations where carbon is actively cycled, with implications for the understanding of carbon cycling and water treatment in peatland catchments.

AB Peats have the unique ability of effectively storing water and carbon. Unfortunately, this ability has been undermined by worldwide peatland degradation. In the Zoige Basin, located in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, peatland degradation is particularly severe. Although climate change and (natural and artificial) drainage systems have been well-recognized as the main factors catalyzing this problem, little is known about the impact of the latter on peatland hydrology at larger spatial scales. To fill this gap, we examined the hydrological connectivity of artificial ditch networks using Google Earth imagery and recorded hydrological data in the Zoige Basin. After delineating from the images of 1392 ditches and 160 peatland patches in which these ditches were clustered, we calculated their lengths, widths, areas, and slopes, as well as two morphological parameters, ditch density (D-d) and drainage ability (P-a). The subsequent statistical analysis and examination of an index defined as the product Dd and Pa showed that structural hydrological connectivity, which was quantitatively represented by the value of this index, decreased when peatland patch areas increased, suggesting that ditches in small patches have higher degrees of hydrological connectivity. Using daily discharge data from three local gauging stations and Manning's equation, we back-calculated the mean ditch water depths (D-m) during raining days of a year and estimated based on D-m the total water volume drained from ditches in each patch (V) during annual raining days. We then demonstrated that functional hydrological connectivity, which may be represented by V, generally decreased when patch areas increased, more sensitive to changes of ditch number and length in larger peatland patches. Furthermore, we found that the total water volume drained from all ditches during annual raining days only took a very small proportion of the total volume of stream flow out of the entire watershed (0.0012%) and this nature remained similar for the past 30 years, suggesting that during annual rainfall events, water drained from connected ditches is negligible. This revealed that the role of connected artificial ditches in draining peatland water mainly takes effect during the prolonged dry season of a year in the Zoige Basin.

AB The characteristics of habitats, individuals and populations of four submerged macrophytes, Lobelia dortmanna L., Isoetes lacustris L., Sphagnum denticulatum Brid. and Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw., were studied in 12 soft water oligohumic lakes which had no inflow of allochtonic DOM and the DOC concentration in the water was <4.0 mg C dm(-3) and 13 humic lakes enriched with allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) from drained peat bogs and ranging in DOC water concentration from 4.1 to 44.0 mg C dm(-3). The analyses of population disintegration were conducted basing on characteristics of individuals (size, habitat, fertility) and populations (aggregation density index, settlement index of the population area). The settlement index of the population area for Lobelia, Fontinalis, Isoetes, Sphagnum decreased from 8.4 to 6.2 g d.w. m(-2), 4.6 to 0.01 g d.w. m(-2), 85.4 to <0.001 g d.w. m(-2) and 39.3 to 7.2 g d.w. m(-2), respectively. Similar trends were observed in aggregation density. The general pattern of the disintegration of populations of these species was always similar. It was independent of the source macrophytes drew resources from or their susceptibility to environmental changes. Individuals began to be eliminated from the deep and central parts of the population area. The remainder of the populations, which persist in the shallowest, best-illuminated part of the area, are themselves endangered by disturbances caused by wavy motion. The only populations of submerged macrophytes which can survive in polyhumic lakes under such conditions are those which are resistant to disturbances common in the shallow littoral (Lobelia dortmanna, Fontinalis antipyretica).

AB The area under the cultivation of perennial bioenergy crops on organic soils in the northern countries is fast increasing. To understand the impact of reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinaceae L.) cultivation on the carbon dioxide (CO2) balance of an organic soil, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured for four years in a RCG cultivated cutover peatland in eastern Finland using the eddy covariance technique. There were striking differences among the years in the annual precipitation. The annual precipitation was higher during 2004 and 2007 and lower during 2005 and 2006 than the 1971-2000 regional mean. During wet growing seasons, moderate temperatures, high surface soil moisture and low evaporative demand favoured high CO2 uptake. During dry seasons, owing to soil moisture and atmospheric stress, photosynthetic activity was severely restricted. The CO2 uptake [gross primary productivity (GPP)] was positively correlated with soil moisture, air temperature and inversely with vapour pressure deficit. Total ecosystem respiration (TER) increased with increasing soil temperature but decreased with increasing soil moisture. The relative responses of GPP and TER to moisture stress were different. While changes in TER for a given change in soil moisture were moderate, variations in GPP were drastic. Also, the seasonal variations in TER were not as conspicuous as those in GPP implying that GPP is the primary regulator of the interannual variability in NEE in this ecosystem. The ecosystem accumulated a total of 398 g Cm-2 from the beginning of 2004 until the end of 2007. It retained some carbon during a wet year such as 2004 even after accounting for the loss of carbon in the form of harvested biomass. Based on this CO2 balance analysis, RCG cultivation is found to be a promising after-use option on an organic soil.

AB Bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) concentrations were determined nine times between April and October 2010 in two humic boreal headwater streams draining forest-and mire-dominated catchments. BAP was analyzed in a bioassay in which natural P-limited bacterioplankton grew with natural P as the sole P source. In both streams, approximately 90% of the BAP occurred as dissolved species (passing a 0.2-mu m filter), consisting partly of low-molecular-weight forms (passing a filter with nominal cutoff at 1 kDa) and partly of high-molecular-weight forms (passing a 0.2-mu m filter but not a 1-kDa filter). Concentrations of total dissolved BAP varied between 1 mu g L-1 and 14 mu g L-1, with the highest values in the middle of the summer. Compared to the forest stream, BAP concentrations were generally higher in the mire stream, where it occasionally amounted to nearly 50% of total P. Molybdate reactive phosphorus overestimated BAP considerably. Most of the BAP was in forms other than free orthophosphate. Temporal BAP variations showed no relationships with dissolved organic carbon (C) or iron but were positively related to air temperature and negatively related to the absorbance ratio (a254 : a365) of organic compounds in the water, indicating connections between terrestrial export of BAP and temperature-dependent terrestrial C metabolism. Concentrations of BAP can relieve stream bacteria from P limitation, and a significant share of BAP exported to streams can reach and be used in downstream lakes.

AB Many peatlands have been drained and harvested for peat mining, agriculture, and other purposes, which has turned them from carbon (C) sinks into C emitters. Rewetting of disturbed peatlands facilitates their ecological recovery and may help them revert to carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks. However, rewetting may also cause substantial emissions of the more potent greenhouse gas (GHG) methane (CH4). Our knowledge of the exchange of CO2 and CH4 following rewetting during restoration of disturbed peatlands is currently limited. This study quantifies annual fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in a disturbed and rewetted area located in the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area in Delta, BC, Canada. Burns Bog is recognized as the largest raised bog ecosystem on North America's west coast. Burns Bog was substantially reduced in size and degraded by peat mining and agriculture. Since 2005, the bog has been declared a conservancy area, with restoration efforts focusing on rewetting disturbed ecosystems to recover Sphagnum and suppress fires. Using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, we measured year-round (16 June 2015 to 15 June 2016) turbulent fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from a tower platform in an area rewetted for the last 8 years. The study area, dominated by sedges and Sphagnum, experienced a varying water table position that ranged between 7.7 (inundation) and -26.5 cm from the surface during the study year. The annual CO2 budget of the rewetted area was -179 +/- 26.2 gCO(2)-Cm-2 yr(-1) (CO2 sink) and the annual CH4 budget was 17 +/- 1.0 gCH(4-)Cm(-2) yr(-1) (CH4 source). Gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) exceeded ecosystem respiration (R-e) during summer months (June-August), causing a net CO2 uptake. In summer, high CH4 emissions (121 mgCH(4)-Cm-2 day(-1)) were measured. In winter (December-February), while roughly equal magnitudes of GEP and R-e made the study area CO2 neutral, very low CH4 emissions (9 mgCH(4)-Cm-2 day(-1)) were observed. The key environmental factors controlling the seasonality of these exchanges were downwelling photosynthetically active radiation and 5 cm soil temperature. It appears that the high water table caused by ditch blocking suppressed R-e. With low temperatures in winter, CH4 emissions were more suppressed than R-e. Annual net GHG flux from CO2 and CH4 expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents (CO2 eq.) during the study period totalled -22 +/- 103.1 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) y(-1) (net CO2 eq. sink) and 1248 +/- 147.6 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) yr(-1) (net CO2 eq. source) by using 100- and 20-year global warming potential values, respectively. Consequently, the ecosystem was almost CO2 eq. neutral during the study period expressed on a 100-year time horizon but was a significant CO2 eq. source on a 20-year time horizon.

AB Question: What are the relative influences of environment and space in structuring the plant composition in a peatland complex?
   Location: Lakkasuo, southern boreal zone, Finland.
   Method: We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) to model spatial structures in the plant composition of a peatland complex comprising ombrotrophic and minerotrophic, open and forested areas. We used redundancy analyses (RDA) and variation partitioning to assess the relative influences of chemical variables (peat and water characteristics), physical variables (hydrology, soil properties, shade), as well as broad-scale (4350 m) and medium-scale (100-350 m) spatial structures on vegetation assemblages.
   Results: We identified five different significant spatial patterns circumscribing (1) the minerotrophic-ombrotrophic gradient; (2) dry ombrotrophic and wet minerotrophic areas; (3) open and shaded areas; (4) dry open/shaded and wet patches within the ombrotrophic areas; and (5) dry open patches and dry forested patches. With spatial structures and environmental variables, we were able to model 30% of the variability in plant composition in the peatland complex, 13% of which was attributable to spatial structures alone.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that in the peatland complex, the spatial dependence processes were more important at the broadest scale, and found that patterns at a medium scale might reflect finer-scale patterns that were not investigated here. Spatial autocorrelation in vegetation composition in the peatland complex appeared to be driven by Sphagnum species. Our results emphasize that spatial modelling should be routinely implemented in studies looking at species composition, since they significantly increase the explained proportion of variance.

AB Re-wetting minerotrophic fens has become an important strategy to mitigate climate change in Germany. However, recent studies report raised methane (CH4) effluxes during the first years after flooding. A minerotrophic fen in north-east Germany that was re-wetted 15 years ago was exposed to exceptionally heavy rainfall and freshwater flooding in August 2011. We measured CH4 effluxes from wetland vegetation stands dominated by Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud., Typha latifolia L. and Carex acutiformis Ehrh., using the closed-chamber method, fortnightly from March 2011 to March 2012 with extra sampling during the flooding. The respective annual effluxes of CH4 (mean +/- 1 standard error) from the three vegetation types were 18.5 +/- 1.3, 21.1 +/- 1.2 and 47.5 +/- 5.0 g m(-2) a(-1), with the August effluxes contributing 40 %, 50 % and 10 % of the annual effluxes. Despite the freshwater flooding in August, annual CH4 effluxes from the 15-year re-wetted fen are similar to those reported from pristine fens. These results are promising because they indicate that, although CH4 effluxes are elevated after re-wetting, they may return to values typical for pristine fens after 15 years. Hence, re-wetting can achieve the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas effluxes from drained minerotrophic fens.

ID WATER STORAGE; SUBSIDENCE; SHRINKAGE; DYNAMICS; FLOW; DEFORMATION;
   BEHAVIOR
AB [ 1] Peatlands respond to natural hydrologic cycles of precipitation and evapotranspiration with reversible deformations due to variations of water content in both the unsaturated and saturated zone. This phenomenon results in short-term vertical displacements of the soil surface that superimpose to the irreversible long-term subsidence naturally occurring in drained cropped peatlands because of bio-oxidation of the organic matter. These processes cause changes in the peat structure, in particular, soil density and void ratio. The consequential changes in the hydrological parameters need to be incorporated in water flow dynamical models. In this paper, we present a new constitutive relationship for the soil shrinkage characteristic (SSC) in peats by describing the variation of porosity with moisture content. This model, based on simple physical considerations, is valid for both anisotropic and isotropic three-dimensional peat deformations. The capability of the proposed SSC to accurately describe the deformation dynamics has been assessed by comparison against a set of laboratory experimental results recently published. The constitutive relationship has been implemented into a Richards' equation - based numerical code and applied for the simulation of the peat soil dynamics as observed in a peatland south of the Venice Lagoon, Italy, in an ad hoc field experiment where the relevant parameters are continuously measured. The modeling results match well a large set of field data encompassing a period of more than 50 days and demonstrate that the proposed approach allows for a reliable reproduction of the soil vertical displacement dynamics as well as the hydrological behavior in terms of, for example, water flow, moisture content, and suction.

AB Over the past century, mires and peatlands have faced a wide range of degradation by artificial drainage, making them one of the most threatened ecosystems in Europe. However, restoration of drained peatlands has gained much importance over the last three decades, mostly due to the multiple ecosystem services they provide such as carbon storage, habitat provision and water flow regulation. Although there has been an increased focus on such ecosystems, spatial research on hydrophysical soil properties following rewetting in coastal mires is lacking. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to understand the spatial structures of hydrophysical properties of organic soils and spatial patterns of organic matter accumulation in relation to soil surface microtopography. Soil organic matter content (SOM) and hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of topsoils (0-28 cm), along with soil textures of the underlying mineral substrate, were investigated in a rewetted non-tidal coastal flood mire (Baltic Sea). The results indicate that the organic horizon with its relatively low K-s acts as a hydrological barrier to infiltration. Soil organic matter content (SOM), K-s and soil surface microtopography are all spatially auto-correlated within 100, 87 and 53 m, respectively. Bivariate Moran's I revealed a positive but weak spatial correlation between SOM and K-s and a moderately strong negative spatial correlation between SOM and soil surface microtopography. A map of SOM was generated using simple kriging, which predicts higher SOM in the centre of the ecosystem, at lower elevations; and lower SOM at the edges of the study area, at higher elevations. Local depressions in the centre of the ecosystem provide a wetter and therefore more anaerobic environment, thereby decreasing carbon mineralisation rates and enabling peat accumulation. The low hydraulic conductivity of the degraded peat in the presence of lower micro-elevations in the centre of the ecosystem is likely to increase the residence time of floodwater and thus may enhance (new) peat accumulation. Thus, we conclude that, for the restoration of non-tidal coastal mires where flooding events are not as frequent, K-s and soil surface microtopography are even more important factors to consider than for tidal systems.

AB Denitrification was measured by the C2H2 inhibition technique in a riparian fen irrigated with agricultural drainage water. 16 h after C2H2 treatment 88 +/- 14% of the total N2O contained in water-saturated cores could be accounted for by assuming equilibrium between the gas phase and the liquid phase. The denitrification activity averaged 2.8 and 8.8 mg N2O-N m-2 day-1 in the control plot and 1.6 and 21.9mg N2O-N m-2 day-1 in the irrigated plot during the dry and the runoff periods respectively. Four percent of the incoming NO3- was reduced to gaseous N. The spatial variability was often high, with coefficients of variation > 100% and was independent of seasonal changes in soil anaerobiosis. Soil NO3- and denitrification were poorly related, and bulk concentrations of NO3- below 200 mum suggested that the process was strongly limited by diffusion of NO3- into the soil during periods of flooding. Mean denitrification and water-filled pores correlated positively, r = 0.71*** for the control and r = 0.68*** for the irrigated plots. Water-soluble C was not related to denitrification. Multiple regression models including soil water, NO3, soluble C and temperature as independent variables, predicted between 21 and 55% of the denitrification, the highest value found when only mean data was considered. Water-filled pores was the most important variable. The observations on which 2 variables controlled denitrification were supported by laboratory experiments with manipulated cores. Water additions increased denitrification only in samples collected during the dry period. Anaerobic incubation of saturated cores did not affect the process. Restricted NO3- availability was clearly illustrated by the 25-41-fold increase obtained when NO3- was injected into cores at ambient and high carbon respectively. A response of up to 13-fold was observed when substrate-amended cores were made into slurries. Glucose did not increase denitrification by more than a factor of three.

AB Carrying out wildlife conservation in a changing climate requires planning on long timescales at both a site and network level, while also having the flexibility to adapt actions at sites over short timescales in response to changing conditions and new information. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), a land-owning wildlife conservation charity in the UK, achieves this on its nature reserves through its system of management planning. This involves setting network-wide objectives which inform the 25-year vision and 5-year conservation objectives for each site. Progress toward achieving each site's conservation objectives is reviewed annually, to identify any adjustments which might be needed to the site's management. The conservation objectives and 25-year vision of each site are reviewed every 5 years. Significant long-term impacts of climate change most frequently identified at RSPB reserves are: loss of intertidal habitat through coastal squeeze, loss of low-lying islands due to higher sea levels and coastal erosion, loss of coastal freshwater and brackish wetlands due to increased coastal flooding, and changes in the hydrology of wetlands. The main types of adaptation measures in place on RSPB reserves to address climate change-related impacts are: re-creation of intertidal habitat, re-creation and restoration of freshwater wetlands away from vulnerable coastal areas, blocking artificial drainage on peatlands, and addressing pressures on freshwater supply for lowland wet grasslands in eastern and southeastern England. Developing partnerships between organizations has been crucial in delivering large-scale adaptation projects.

AB Peatland biological, physical and chemical properties change over time in response to alterations in long-term water table position. Such changes complicate our ability to predict the response of peatland carbon stocks to sustained drying. In order to better understand the effect of sustained lowering of the water table on peatland carbon dynamics, we re-visited a drainage-affected bog, repeating eddy covariance measurements of CO2 flux after a 16-year interval. We found the ecosystem CO2 sink to have strengthened across the intervening period, despite a deep and fluctuating water table. This was mostly due to an increase in CO2 uptake through photosynthesis associated with increased shrub growth. We also observed a decline in CO2 loss through ecosystem respiration. These changes could not be attributed to environmental conditions. Air temperature was the only significant contemporaneous driver of monthly anomalies in CO2 fluxes, with higher temperatures decreasing the net CO2 sink via increased ecosystem respiration. However, the effect of air temperature was weak in comparison to the underlying differences between time periods. Therefore, we demonstrate that for drying peatlands, long-term changes within the ecosystem can be of primary importance as drivers of CO2 exchange. In this peatland, the ecosystem carbon sink has shown resilience to water table drawdown, with internal feedbacks leading to a recovery of the CO2 sink after a 16-year interval.

AB Changes in the structure of plant communities may have much more impact on ecosystem carbon (C) cycling than any phenotypic responses to environmental changes. We studied these impacts via the response of plant litter quality, at the level of species and community, to persistent water-level (WL) drawdown in peatlands. We studied three sites with different nutrient regimes, and water-level manipulations at two time scales. The parameters used to characterize litter quality included extractable substances, cellulose, holocellulose, composition of hemicellulose (neutral sugars, uronic acids), Klason lignin, CuO oxidation phenolic products, and concentrations of C and several nutrients. The litters formed four chemically distinct groups: non-graminoid foliar litters, graminoids, mosses and woody litters. Direct effects of WL drawdown on litter quality at the species level were overruled by indirect effects via changes in litter type composition. The pristine conditions were characterized by Sphagnum moss and graminoid litters. Short-term (years) responses of the litter inputs to WL drawdown were small. In long-term (decades), total litter inputs increased, due to increased tree litter inputs. Simultaneously, the litter type composition and its chemical quality at the community level greatly changed. The changes that we documented will strongly affect soil properties and C cycle of peatlands.

DT Article
ID BLANKET PEAT; WATER; WETLANDS; DYNAMICS; DRAINAGE; CHINA
AB Zoige Peatland in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the largest alpine peatland in China, was widely ditched in 1970s for pasture expansion. The ditching is believed to have caused peatland degradation, but there is still no widespread agreement on this due to the absence of essential regional and temporal information about ditch drainage. Therefore, this study used both remote-sensing observations and field surveys to examine the ecological influences of ditching for this alpine peatland. In the study, ditch distribution was interpreted with remote-sensing imagery and the ecological responses were investigated with temporal observation by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and field surveys. The results showed that there were similar to 1200 km ditches interpreted, mainly in three spatial patterns depending on hydro-geomorphologies. The MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was more sensitive to peatland surface water depth (R-2 = 0.678, P < 0.001) than the normalized difference water index (NDWI) (R-2 = 0.583, P < 0.001), because the latter would become saturated at a certain surface water depth (similar to 50 cm in Zoige). The temporal MODIS imagery reflected the ecological responses of ditched peatland to drainage in terms of vegetation density and water conditions. This study indicated that ditching depressed the surface water depth of the Zoige Peatland in summer, but not to the extent of completely transforming peatland into steppe due to the recharging of local beneficial hydro-geomorphologies. The MODIS indices investigated in the study could be used to monitor the annual regional status of vegetation cover and surface water for Zoige peatland.

AB We experimentally tested two geochemical models which have been proposed as potential mechanisms leading to the catastrophic dieback of Typha domingensis in constructed Lake Agmon within the drained Hula peatland, northern Israel. An elaborate lysimeter station simulating the conditions imposed by sulphide toxicity and P deficiency models was used to test them experimentally. Rhizosphere pH and redox potential were monitored in situ in real time throughout the summers of 2007 and 2008. A comparative study of redox-reduction simulation was coupled with periodic sampling and analysis of sulphide and other reducing species. N and P were determined in the plant tissues to compute the N:P nutrient limitation index and evaluate nutrient deficiencies. The sulphide toxicity model was not accepted as a viable mechanism because Typha domingensis stands did not show any signs of stress, even when growing in rhizosphere with a sulphide concentration three times that during the actual dieback in 1996. The P limitation model was not supported by the N:P index, which indicated N (<14) rather than P (>16) limitation. Since Typha has now returned and is thriving in Lake Agmon and adjacent drainage canals, we suggest a self-thinning mechanism followed by normal succession of macrophytes in this relatively young constructed wetland as the most logical mechanism to explain the observed dieback.

AB Nitrate labelled with N-15 was added for 2 years to a small Boreal Shield forested catchment to evaluate where new nitrogen (N) inputs are stored in this system in the short term. The landscape in the study catchment is a mosaic of Pinus banksiana Lamb. - Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP "forest islands" surrounded by "pillows" of lichens, mosses, and grasses on exposed bedrock surfaces. After the second year of N addition, 10% of the added N-15 was found in aboveground biomass, 27% in organic horizons, 6% in forest island mineral soil, 3% in "soil" underneath pillows, and 16% was lost through runoff. Despite covering a smaller proportion of the catchment and having only slightly larger N stocks, forest islands stored more N-15 (31%) than pillows (15%). Preferential routing of water towards forest islands and a greater potential for biotic and abiotic N immobilization are hypothesized to favor N retention in forest islands. Thirty-eight percent of the N-15 could not be accounted for. The comparison of a mass-balance analysis with the N-15 recovery suggests a missing sink for the N-15 in forest islands, possibly woody detritus. In the short term (similar to 2 years), organic horizons are the main sinks for elevated N inputs in the boreal forest.

AB Mires in the Danubian Lowland (Northern part of the Pannonian Basin) are typically overgrown with common alder (Alnus glutinosa). Similar stands at this location are unfortunately very rare, what is caused by continuous human intervention in landscape and its natural pattern from Early Holocene. Peatland degradation near Puste Ulany village started in the mid - eighteenth century, what is supported by historical maps. In the previous century a huge peat extraction took place at this specific mire. Despite these anthropogenic changes, there are still some remnants of natural habitats present, mostly dependant on ground water level. Methodology includes historical map's analysis, digital terrain model and vegetation cover mapping. Actual map of biotopes was completed for the current state of the vegetation cover acquaintance. Historical map's analysis revealed changes and development in the vegetation cover as well as the further relevant landscape changes in the mire during drainage system building. The first artificial drainage channel was built in the second half of the eighteenth century. Subsequently, dense system of the drainage channels was built near Tovarniky settlement, continuing the drainage of this area for meadows, pastures and arable land acquisition. This wetland habitat was probably one of the largest mires in Slovakia during Holocene. Its area used to be markedly larger and its sedimentary basin presented much more important influence on landscape development. However, the historical sources revealed higher occurrence of common alder in the past, as well as typical xerothermic oak forest in this area. 27 biotopes were identified, from which 13 biotopes was purely human induced. Most of the area is currently abandoned for its own vegetation succession.

AB 1. This account reviews information on all aspects of the biology of Juniperus communis that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.
   2. Juniperus communis (juniper) is an evergreen dioecious gymnosperm shrub with two main population centres in Britain, one on chalk downlands of southern England and the other in northern England and Scotland. British populations are divided into two main subspecies although there is overlap in genetic and morphological features. Subspecies communis varies from a spreading shrub to an erect tree characteristic of calcareous soils in southern England, various soils in the Scottish highlands, while ssp. nana is a small procumbent shrub, restricted to well-drained bogs and, more usually, rocky outcrops, generally as a minor component of upland heaths and montane scrub. Both subspecies are drought and frost tolerant, although sensitive to fire. A third subspecies, hemisphaerica, primarily found in mountains of southern Europe has two small populations on maritime cliffs in the UK.
   3. Although not very palatable, J. communis is grazed by small and large mammals when food is short, particularly in winter. Its low palatability is derived from oils found in the needles, cones and wood, dominated by monoterpenes. These have been extensively used in folklore medicine and to flavour alcoholic drinks, and are being investigated for new medicinal uses.
   4. Juniperus communis ssp. communis is a characteristic light-demanding invader of pasture but has declined due to agricultural expansion, erosion, overgrazing, fire and poor regeneration, such that it is now rare and threatened across lowland/southern Europe. Although susceptible to overgrazing, some grazing can be beneficial to create the open sward necessary for seedling establishment. Other limits to regeneration are: progressively ageing stands in which male plants predominate; increasing fragmentation of stands that reduces pollination efficacy; and high seed dormancy with consequent variable germinability.

AB Wettability is one of the most important peculiarities of soil and it directly influences their physical, mechanical, chemical, properties biological and their fertility. Soil water repellency can lead to the development of unstable wetting and preferential flow paths. Water flow and solute transport patterns are complex under such conditions. The existence of the water repellent layer can have negative influence on soil moisture content because it reduces the amount of water supplied from ground water level by capillary rise, infiltration from the soil surface and also for retention and therefore acts as a constraint in the restoration of drained peatlands by rewetting. That means that repellency can have significant influence on restoration, conservation and management of the peat resources. The paper presents the result of the spatial variability of soil moisture in a small area in a hydrophobic peat-muck profile located within Kuwasy drainage-subirrigation system at the Biebrza River Valley. Soil moisture variability study was carried out on an area of 1 m(2) and 0.5 depth in the two measurement periods. The measurements were made in two versions: the first after artificial irrigation (60 mm) and the second after an intense rain. In both of measuring periods the study area was divided into a regular grid of squares. Spatial variability of the investigated traits was evaluated using parameters of the theoretical variogram and cross variogram models. The variability of soil moisture in the profile after intense rainfall was higher than after irrigation. The maximum range of the spatial correlation (189 cm) soil moisture was observed in the alder peat layer for measurements made after irrigation. The observed variability is associated with high hydrophobicity of studied soil. The observed variability may be important in the assessment of current water resources of the soil profile. The relationship between water content and the surface of the sampling indicates that, following the increase of the sampling surface the dispersion of results gets smaller, and the distributions are symmetric. The relationship between the coefficient of variation CV and the surface sampling shows that most of the variability occurred in the top moorsh layer of soil tested (CV = 40%). To check the stationary conditions for soil moisture measurements, the analysis of the trend were made. Elimination of the trend also provided a normal distribution of residual moisture values. Semivariance and cross variance for residual moisture values were calculated, and then were leveled with spherical or linear model. From the presented data results that after irrigation as well as heavy rain falls there exists the relationship between the distribution of moisture muck individual layers (up to 30 cm) and can be described using a spherical model. The results show large spatial variability of the total variance of soil moisture and poor soil moisture spatial correlation between the different layers of the soil profile.

AB The carbon sink function of peatlands is the result of a relatively small imbalance between biomass production and decay and proposed to be sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Thus, peat decomposition plays a decisive role in determining the future carbon balances of peatlands under changing climatic conditions and increasing human pressure. To evaluate the effects of peatland degradation on the degree of decomposition in light of deviating site histories and to reveal interrelations between different indicators, we analysed peat depth profiles of physicochemical peat decomposition proxies across nine study sites in two valley bogs in the Eastern Alps, Austria. For this purpose, we divided 1 m peat cores sampled at the nine sites into 4 cm sections and analysed these peat samples for bulk density, loss on ignition, pH value, carbon and nitrogen content and ratio, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures, and five humification indices based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Besides, we regularly measured water levels and incubated litter bags over two years. Peat characteristics were found to be relatively homogenous across the treeless and only slightly degraded sites. At these sites, depth profiles followed similar patterns with strongly increasing decomposition in the uppermost layers and the highest degree of peat decomposition at 40-56 cm depths for most proxies. Thus, our findings suggest that even apparently only slightly degraded sites were distinctly affected by past drainages. In contrast to the open peat bog sites, the degree in peat decomposition was distinctly higher at tree-encroached sites and at long-term drained former peat-cutting sites. Both, the distinct difference in the degree of decomposition between the two peatlands and the inverse decomposition depth trends, i.e., more decomposed peat overlying less decomposed layers, highlight the importance of secondary decomposition on the depth profiles and the strong effects of site histories on the current degree of peat decomposition. The results of two-year litter bag incubations of four vascular plant species revealed distinct differences in species-specific litter decomposition rates and considerable differences for same species between the two investigated bogs. The strong interrelations between different humification indices underline the simultaneous effects of proceeding decay on the different chemical properties of the peat. Besides, humification indices were strongly related with other physical and chemical properties of peats and highest loadings on the principal component 1 that accounted for 41% of the total variance of the dataset were found for four different humification indices, bulk density and nitrogen contents. We conclude that the selective preservation of aliphatic, acid and aromatic groups during peat decomposition are well suited to elucidate small-scale differences in the degree of decomposition and to strongly interrelate with established indicators as bulk densities.

AB Climate change and associated sea level rise will likely affect coastal ecosystems and lead to more frequent inundations. Plants are an important control for methane (CH4) emissions in peatlands because the metabolism of the living plant can either enhance or attenuate CH4 emissions and plant litter supplies an easily available carbon source for methanogenesis. Here we compare the contribution of various dominant plant species to methane emissions in a degraded, rewetted coastal brackish fen at the southern Baltic Sea coast in Northeast Germany. We analyse one year of bi-weekly static closed chamber data gathered at measurement spots that were located in different mono-dominant vegetation stands (Bolboschoenus maritimus (L.) Palla, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (C.C.Gmel.) Palla, Carex acutiformis Ehrh.). Furthermore, data on water level, water temperature, conductivity (sulphate), and several peat characteristics were recorded. Generally, the annual methane emissions were low with an average across vegetation stands of 14 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), which we related to high decomposition of peat after drainage and to relatively low water levels in summer. Nevertheless, methane emissions varied between different vegetation types with significantly higher methane fluxes (31.8 +/- A 5.7 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1)) from Bolboschoenus maritimus stands compared to Carex acutiformis and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani stands (4.3 +/- A 1.2 and 5.7 +/- A 2.4 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1), respectively). None of the environmental variables that have been recorded can explain this difference. Thus, vegetation composition seems to be an important driver for methane emissions in coastal brackish fens and may therefore be crucial with regard to recreation measures.

AB Large agricultural areas reclaimed in the past century, south of the Venice Lagoon, have experienced significant land subsidence due to oxidation of peat organic soils. This has exposed the region to flood hazard particularly during severe storms and has contributed to increase the marginal management cost of the infrastructures (ditches, levees, pumping stations) designed to operate the drainage system. Direct measurements and indirect evidence from the channel network suggest a land settlement between 1.5 and 2 m over the past 70 years. This paper provides an overview of the problem with important information on its most recent evolution.

AB Peat wetlands are of major importance for ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water regulation and maintenance of biodiversity. However, peat drainage for farming leads to CO2 emission, soil subsidence and biodiversity losses. In the peat areas in the Netherlands, solutions are sought in reducing drainage, adapting farming to wetter soils, and converting productive dairy grasslands to less intensively managed semi-natural grasslands. Our objective was to compare the soil ecology and related ecosystem services of dairy and semi-natural grasslands on peat soils (Terric Histosols). Soil biotic and abiotic parameters were measured in twenty dairy and twenty semi-natural sites, with particular focus on (i) soil faunal diversity (ecosystem service "maintenance of biodiversity"), (ii) CO2 emission ("climate regulation"), (iii) water infiltration ("water regulation") and (iv) soil fertility ("grass production"). Mean soil faunal taxonomic richness per site (alpha diversity) was higher in dairy grasslands compared to semi-natural grasslands. However, the total observed number of taxa (gamma diversity) in dairy grassland was 13% lower for soil fauna and 21% lower when including plant species. Potential C mineralization rate in the topsoil - used as a proxy for CO2 emission - was not influenced by land use but was limited by drought. Additionally, potential C mineralization depended on different C sources and microbial groups in the two grassland types. Water infiltration rate differed by a factor of five between land use types (dairy > semi-natural), and correlated with soil porosity. As expected, soil fertility was higher in dairy than in semi-natural grasslands. However, potential N mineralization was similar in dairy and semi-natural grasslands and was correlated negatively with bacterial biomass apparently indicating N immobilization, and positively with bacterial growth that depended on labile C and N in soil. Our study on peat soils shows that dairy versus semi-natural grassland use influences biodiversity, climate regulation, water regulation and (potential for) grassland production. We conclude with recommendations for land management to optimize the delivery of those ecosystem services.

AB The study was conducted in a small (7.4 ha) peatland system with a humic lake concentrically surrounded by Sphagnum mat (Caricetum limosae) and Sphagnum bog (Ledo-Sphagnetum) in the Mazurian Lakeland in North-Eastern Poland. The peatland was situated in a forested catchment with a total area of 16.25 ha, and was influenced by surface drainage, artificially designed for forestry purposes. The content of zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and hydrogen (H) ions was analysed in waters from precipitation, humic lake, mat, bog and surface outflow. The yearly budget of these ions, expressed as difference between atmospheric inflow and surface outflow, for the whole catchment was presented. The drainage of the peatland system over three years was accompanied by an increase in pH of lake, mat and bog waters. The whole catchment retention of H+ and trace metals studied decreased yearly in absolute values under these conditions. The peatland system began to leach Pb into surface waters and lost its ability to intercept Cd. These effects could be caused by intensity of outflow of water and sulphates and lowering of water storage. However, the potential to retain Zn and Cu ions was preserved.

AB We report on methane (CH4) concentrations and efflux densities that were measured over a drained and grazed, peatland pasture in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta of California over a three year period. The site was ideal for micrometeorological flux measurements due to its very flat topography, its exposure to vigorous winds and its extended fetch along the predominant wind direction. Nevertheless, the interpretation of methane fluxes with eddy covariance proved to be extremely complicated by a number of geographical, biophysical, biogeochemical and site management factors.
   Initial inspection of the data revealed unexpected results methane concentrations and efflux densities were greatest during the night rather than during the day. To explain this odd diurnal behavior in methane efflux densities and concentration, we tested two hypotheses. The prime hypothesis presupposed that the stable stratification of the nocturnal boundary layer elongated the flux footprint and enabled the flux tower to sense wetter fields at the western edge of the pasture, flooded drainage ditches, and/or a tidal marsh upwind of the pasture these land forms emitted methane at rates 10-100 times greater than the drained portion of the peatland. And, this methane was emitted into a shallower volume of the atmosphere due to the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer, causing methane concentrations to rise faster. The alternative hypothesis attributed the higher nocturnal methane fluxes to cattle, as they may have congregated near the tower at night.
   We investigated these hypotheses with: (1) a series of micrometeorological field measurements at companion sites upwind and downwind of the pasture; (2) a series of chamber-based flux measurements on the representative land classes; (3) through the lens of a one-dimensional planetary boundary layer (pbl), box model; and (4) via inspection of digital camera images for the presence or absence of cattle. Together, these pieces of data suggest that elevated methane fluxes and concentrations at night were due to the combined correlation between: (1) the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer; (2) the elongation of the flux and concentration footprints; and (3) the preferential sampling of an elevated methane source, be it the cattle, wet proportions of the field or some combination. On the other hand, our flux measurements were not perturbed by methane emanating from the tidal marsh that was several kilometers upwind of the peatland pasture site. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrological behavior of an ombrogenous raised peat bog has been observed and described in many studies; however, not in complexity with other soils. This research deals with the hydrological function of peat bog in a catchment where peat bog (formed by Histosol or other hydromorphic soils) covers only a part of the area (40-60%). Two soil types, creating two main hillslopes of the experimental catchment in this study, form the dominant soil types (Podzol and Histosol) in the Sumava Mountains, Czechia. A modified HBV model was used to estimate the contribution of each soil type to common outflow and for the estimation of the water balance. According to previous research and field observations, dominant hydrological processes were described for each hillslope (soil). The HBV model was used for the quantification of a ratio between fast and slow flow at Peat bog hillslope and Podzol hillslope. At Peat bog hillslope, the majority of outflow (67%) was formed from the upper soil layer (Acrotelm). In the mineral soil hillslope, a larger portion of runoff was generated from the lower soil layers or bedrock interface (61%). Peat bog contributes to a stream mainly during rainfall events; however, the model showed also significant deep percolation at the Peat bog hillslope and considerable contribution to baseflow during a year. Generally, more precipitation water was turned by the model into runoff at the Peat bog hillslope, which was also exhibited by a lower rate of actual evapotranspiration (21% of precipitation), compared to 29% in the case of Podzol hillslope. If we consider land-use changes in this locality in terms of expanding or reducing peat areas (draining, drains damming, droughts, etc.), this model could sufficiently estimate the hydrological behavior of local streams and thus can be potentially used in hydrological planning by local authorities.

AB Northern peatland ecosystems represent large carbon (C) stocks that are susceptible to changes such as accelerated mineralization due to water table lowering expected under a climate change scenario. During the growing seasons (1 May to 31 October) of 2011 and 2012 we monitored CO2 fluxes and plant biomass along a microtopographic gradient (hummocks- hollows) in an undisturbed dry continental boreal treed bog (control) and a nearby site that was drained (drained) in 2001. Ten years of drainage in the bog significantly increased coverage of shrubs at hummocks and lichens at hollows. Considering measured hummock coverage and including tree incremental growth, we estimate that the control site was a sink of -92 in 2011 and -70 g C m(-2) in 2012, while the drained site was a source of 27 and 23 g C m-2 over the same years. We infer that, drainage-induced changes in vegetation growth led to increased biomass to counteract a portion of soil carbon losses. These results suggest that spatial variability (microtopography) and changes in vegetation community in boreal peatlands will affect how these ecosystems respond to lowered water table potentially induced by climate change.

AB Extensive patterned mires in valley heads and on glacial benches in southern New Zealand: (45 degrees 22'S; 1250-1400 m.a.s.l.), and valley floors in Tierra del Fuego (54 degrees 53'S; 60-100 m.a.s.l.) have developed under cool, moist climatic conditions favourable for peat accumulation.
   In southern New Zealand's tussock grassland landscape, aapa mire pools (often with peat islands) and ridges, are elongated (pools: mean 24.5 +/- 2.4 m x 7.5 +/- 1.0 m) and aligned 90 degrees to gentle slopes. Feat depths (0.3-2.5 m) are greatest on downslope margins of pools and sometimes associated with basement profile concavities. Pools up to 1.3 m deep have peat bases, are generally not fed by nor linked to surface streams, and have steep downslope, with more gentle upslope, margins. Pools may be incipient (occupying small pear depressions), fluctuating or permanent. In steeper headwater sections, surface and underground channels link small stream pools. On glacial benches, pools (to 1 ha) occupy basement rock depressions with up to 1.5 m of underlying peat.
   Vegetation displays a repeating basic pattern. On pool rims aquatic mosses (Acrocladium samzentosum and/or Sphagnum falcatulum) cover steep pool edges; S. squarrosum inner faces of rims; S. cristatum, Carex galldichaudiana and C. lachenalii on rims and declines. The tall, vertical peat pedestals support a similar vegetation pattern. Carer gaudichaudiana occupies shore margins prone to intermittent flooding with peat-forming Sphagnum mosses absent. Islands are produced from elongated peninsulas or sinuate mainland shores. These persist if peat formation exceeds water level rise. Snow tussocks of Chionochloa macra grow on localised elevated areas unrelated to subsurface topography.
   In Tierra del Fuego, raised (4-6 m) rain-fed aapa mires, bordered by intermittent lagg streams, develop amongst partially cleared Nothofagus pumilio forest. Elongated (3-60 m length), steep-sided and island (circular: c. 2 m diameter)- studded pools, form generally parallel crescentic lines with regular to sinuate margins associated with incipient islands. Occasional islands are either decadent, or submerged and moribund. Sphagnum magellanicum and Empetrum rubrum dominate above water level, amongst pure stands of Marsippospermum grandiflorum on higher ground. Sphagnum fimbriatum characterises a narrow zone at water line.
   Vegetation/peat development reinforces pool-vegetation boundaries. Until drained, vegetation/firm peat development is prevented in pools greater than or equal to 20 cm deep. Following localised subterranean drainage, non-wetland species may colonise.
   Underlying topography, differential peat formation, hydrological and drainage properties, plus vegetation development all influence patterning in the mires. Biotic factors are emphasised over physical processes in the origin and maintenance of the patterned wetland systems but are not mutually exclusive.

AB The drainage of peatlands for their agricultural use leads to huge emissions of greenhouse gases. One sustainable alternative is the cultivation of peat mosses after rewetting ('Sphagnum farming'). Environmental parameters of such artificial systems may differ from those of natural Sphagnum ecosystems which host a rich fungal community. We studied the fungal community at a 4 ha Sphagnum fanning field site in Northwestern Germany and compared it with that of natural Sphagnum ecosystems. Additionally, we asked if any fungi occur with potentially negative consequences for the commercial production and/or use of Sphagnum biomass. Samples were collected every 3 months within 1 year. High-throughput sequencing of the fungal ITS2 barcode was used to obtain a comprehensive community profile of the fungi. The dominant taxa in the fungal community of the Sphagnum farming field site were all commonly reported from natural Sphagnum ecosystems. While the taxonomic composition showed clear differences between seasons, a stable functional community profile was identified across seasons. Additionally, nutrient supply seems to affect composition of fungal community. Despite a rather high abundance of bryophyte parasites, and the occurrence of both Sphagnum-species-specific and general plant pathogens, their impact on the productivity and usage of Sphagnum biomass as raw material for growing media was considered to be low.

AB Pollen records across parts of Ireland, England and northern Scotland show a dramatic collapse in Pinus pollen percentages at approximately 4000 radiocarbon years BP. This phenomenon has attracted much palaeoecological interest and several hypotheses have been put forward to account for this often synchronous and rapid reduction in pine from mid-Holocene woodland. Explanations for the 'pine decline' include prehistoric human activity, climatic change, in particular a substantial increase in precipitation resulting in increased mire wetness, and airborne pollution associated with the deposition of tephra. Hitherto, one largely untested hypothesis is that mineral deficiency could adversely affect pine growth and regeneration on mire surfaces. The discovery of pine-tree remains (wood pieces, stumps and trunks) within a peat located at Cadogan's Bog on the Mizen Peninsula, southwest Ireland, provided an opportunity to investigate the history of Pinus sylvestris and also to assess the importance of mineral nutrition in maintaining pine growth on mires. Pollen, plant macrofossils, microscopic charcoal and geochemical data are presented from a radiocarbon dated monolith extracted from this peat together with tree ring-width data and radiocarbon dated age estimates from subfossil wood. Analyses of these data suggest that peat accumulation commenced at the site around 6000 years BP when pine was the dominant local tree. Thereafter Pinus pollen percentages diminish in two stages, with the second decline taking place around 4160 +/- 50 years BP. Concomitant with this decline in Pinus pollen, there is a noticeable, short-lived increase in wet-loving mire taxa and a decrease in the concentration of phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, iron and zinc. These results suggest that increased mire surface wetness, possibly the result of a change in climate, created conditions unsuitable for pine growth c. 4000 years BP. Mire surface wetness, coupled with a period of associated nutrient deficiency, appears to be a possible explanation for a lack of subsequent pine-seedling establishment for most of the later Holocene.

AB Throughout the last two centuries peatlands have been subject to extensive drainage, typically through the digging of ditches. Ecosystem restoration now focusses on damming or infilling these ditches to increase biodiversity and to provide a range of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water provision. We surveyed 60 bog pools created following ditch blocking (alone) on a blanket bog in north Wales. Eighteen months after restoration the mean total pool vegetation cover was 76%. There was a strong negative relationship between pool depth and Eriophorum cover (r(2) = 0.74), and a weaker positive relationship between depth and Sphagnum cover (r(2) = 0.35). Observations showed that pools had been colonised by various invertebrate species. Pool dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were not connected to pool vegetation, suggesting that catchment-scale processes drive DOC. Other studies have shown that Eriophorum generates large methane fluxes, and that Sphagnum can act as a methane sink. Therefore we recommend that pools should be deeper than 0.5 m to give the greatest carbon benefit, whilst noting that this is unlikely to significantly affect DOC fluxes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

AB Drained peat soils in Belarus occupy 11.3 % of agricultural land. These soils lost their genetic traits on the area of almost 260 thousand hectares, and moved into the category of anthropogenically transformed, over 190 thousand hectares of those - into the category of degraded. The most important condition for improving the properties of low-ash peat soils is an increase of ash elements level - up to 50-70 % in the plowing layer. The anthropogenically formed layer-mixed culture of soil profile with deep reclamation plowing method corresponds to this to the fullest extent. Its use is important on shallow peatlands that quickly lose their organic layer. It has been determined that the depth of such plowing is determined both by the thickness of peat bog and by the thickness of plowed mineral soil (sand or sandy loam). Based on the obtained analytical expressions, analysis of process layouts for formation of new soil profile by the plow, taking into account availability of peat soil areas according to deposit capacity, feasibility of using two types of special plows is substantiated: double-cut mounted type with plowing depth of 50-100 cm and single-cut trailed type with plowing depth of 90-150 cm. Technologically rational is plow operation according to layout with undercut equal to the width of sandy layer in sub-plowing horizon. At the same time, the interval of rational values of structural width of double-cut plow grip (on the II cut body) b k = 50-67 cm, and the width of plow grip shall not exceed 100 cm. Ratio of its actual value to the accepted design width of the bodies is in the range of (5 : 4)-(2 : 1) depending on agrotechnical requirements. The designed PTN-0.9 double-cut plow for deep amelioratory plowing has passed acceptance tests and is recommended for serial production. The result of the study is theory of dump plowing. The results allow for development of special double-cut plows for deep amelioratory treatment of shallow peat bogs, which ensures their preservation during agricultural use.

AB The authors determined the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and electrical conductivity, as well as the colour and pH in the ground waters of 26 peat-bogs in Pomerania (NW Poland). Three kinds of peat-bogs have been taken into account - forestless - sphagnum - cover bogs, bog coniferous forests and birch swamps. The condition of bogs was classified as good, moderate or poor as regards their natural qualities. In good natural-status peat-bogs the lowest amounts of DOC (about 30 mg C dm(-3)) and conductivity (< 100 muS cm(-1)) were found in the water of the peat of sphagnum-cover bogs, higher levels were recorded in forest peat-bog water (DOC - 50 mg C dm(-3), conductivity - 100 muS cm(-1)). Drainage of all the kinds of peat-bog under study leads to an increase in the concentration of DOC (>70 mg C dm(-3)) and conductivity (up to 90 AS cm(-1) in degraded sphagnum-cover bogs and 140-150 muS cm(-1) in degraded forest bogs); there also occurs an increase in acidity (from pH 4.0-3.7 to 3.7-3.4) and coloration (from 300 to 1000 mg Pt dm(-3) in forestless peat-bogs and from 600-800 to 1400-1600 mg Pt dm(-3) in forest bogs).

AB A mixed provenance Sitka spruce plantation, planted in 1986 on a drained deep peat, has been exposed to 6 different simulated mist treatments in 4 replicated blocks since 1996. Treatments provided N and/or S at a concentration of 1.6 mol m(-3), supplying ca. 50 k g S and/or N ha(-1)yr(-1) as N (NH4NO3), S (Na2SO4), NS Acid (NH4NO3 + H2SO4 at pH 2.5), 2NS Acid (double dose by application at twice frequency), a control treatment supplied with additional rainwater only and a 'no treatment' set of plots. Throughfall, preserved with thymol in the field, was collected using gutters with a surface area of 1m(2) in all the replicate plots, and was analysed for all major ions. Prior to treatment in 1999, S deposition in throughfall exceeded that in rain because of dry deposition of SO2 and SO42- to the canopy; NH4+ and NO3- ions were both retained in the canopy. During treatment, only 20-40% of the applied N in the high-N treatments was retained in the canopy. Acidity in the applied mist was partly neutralised by the canopy, but not primarily through exchange of base cations, leading to the conclusion that weak organic acids, in solution or in situ in the canopy, contributed to the buffering of the H+ ion deposition in the acid treatments.

AB Large areas of northern peatlands have been drained and afforested with conifers in the 20th century. This has led to changes in the hydrology of the peatlands, the quality and quantity of organic matter inputs and soil microbial communities, which are all likely to impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Considerable areas of these forest plantations are undergoing restoration, and our aim was to assess whether contrasting compositions of peat, in conjunction with hydrological changes in a controlled lab experiment, impact on GHG fluxes. We incubated vegetation free cores (at 8 degrees C) from a near-natural bog, restoration sites felled in 1998, 2006, 2012 and a current forest plantation at (a) low water tables, (b) high tables or (c) water tables that were changed from low to high. Results show that peat quality and nutrient availability in the pore water have been altered by the forest plantations, which resulted in dissimilar carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the sites under the same temperature and water table conditions. Higher CO2 fluxes were found in the peat cores from the forest plantations than from sites that have undergone restoration and from the near-natural bog. However, there were few differences in methane (CH4) fluxes from the different sites, indicating that on its own (i.e., in the absence of biotic interactions under field conditions) the effects of forestry on CH4 flux are limited.

TI Draining the coastal marshes of north-west Norfolk: the contribution of
   the Le Stranges at Hunstanton, 1605 to 1724
SO AGRICULTURAL HISTORY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Wetland reclamation in early modern England is generally associated with the Fens and the large drainage projects initiated by James I in the 1620s. In these schemes, syndicates of landowners ventured their capital in risky projects in return for grants of land. Vast fortunes were made and huge losses incurred while local inhabitants struggled to protect their rights. These 'adventures' have dominated the drainage literature since H. C. Darby's pioneering work on the Fen land in the 1940s, but little attention has been paid to the piecemeal reclamation of the coastal marshes of north and north-west Norfolk undertaken mostly by the local gentry throughout this period. Using the memoranda and farming notebooks kept by four generations of the Le Strange family of Hunstanton from 1605 to 1724, this article casts light on their drainage projects and assesses what distinguishes them from the more spectacular and familiar schemes elsewhere.

AB Drainage and intensive use of fens lead to alterations in the physical characteristics of peat soils. This was demonstrated using parameters of water balance (available water capacity) and the evaluated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Deriving the distribution of the pore sizes from the water retention curve was flawed because of shrinkage due to drainage, especially at high soil water potentials. These errors became greater as the peat was less influenced by soil-genetic processes. The water retention curves (desorption) evaluated is the field and the laboratory satisfactorily corresponded. However, the wetting- and drainage-curves obtained in the field differed up to 30 vol.-% water content at same soil water potentials. These differences were largely due to a wetting inhibition.

AB Peat soils represent an important global carbon (C) sink, but can also provide a highly fertile medium for growing horticultural crops. Sustainable crop production on peat soils involves a trade-off between ensuring food security and mitigating typically high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and rates of soil C loss. An alternative approach to resource intensive field-based monitoring of GHG fluxes for all potential management scenarios is to use a process-based model driven by existing field data to estimate emissions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model for estimating emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 from horticultural peat soils. The model was parameterised using climatic, soil, and crop management data from two intensively cultivated sites on soils of contrasting soil organic matter (SOM) contents ( similar to 35% and similar to 70% SOM content). Simulated emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4, and simulated soil physical and crop output values, were compared to actual GHG, soil and crop measurements. Model performance was assessed using baseline parameterisation (i.e. model defaults), then calibrated using pre-simulation and sensitivity analysis processes. Under baseline parameterisation conditions, DNDC proved poor at predicting GHG emissions and soil/crop variables. Calibration and validation improved DNDC performance in estimating the annual magnitude of emissions, but model refinement is still required for reproducing seasonal GHG patterns in particular. Key constraints on model functioning appear to be its ability to reliably model soil moisture and some aspects of C and nitrogen dynamics, as well as the quality of input data relating to water table dynamics. In conclusion, our results suggest that the DNDC (v. 9.5) model cannot accurately reproduce or be used to replace actual field measurements for estimation of GHG emission factors under different management scenarios for horticultural peat soils, but may be able to do so with further modification.

AB The authors previously extended the macro-element method proposed by Sekiguchi to include water absorption and discharge functions and incorporated this into a soil water coupled finite deformation analysis code capable of accounting for inertial forces. The primary objective of this study is to validate the ability of the proposed method to simulate actual ground behavior by comparing the simulation results with the actual measurements of the embankment loading of a soft peat ground improved with vertical drains and vacuum consolidation. It was found that the proposed method is capable of comprehensively and closely simulating not only the magnitude of settlement, but also various ground behaviors, including the deformation of the surrounding ground and pore water pressure distributions. Furthermore, additional simulations were performed to elucidate the effect of a continuous middle sand layer found to exist and to span the entire improved area at an actual embankment site.
   The next objective of this study is to investigate the impact of ground improvement, using vertical drains and vacuum consolidation with embankment loading on a soft ground, placing a particular focus on the effect of drain spacing. In this case, an ultra-soft ground with alternating peat and clay layers was modeled to represent a typical ground to which vacuum consolidation would be applied. Based on a series of simulations, it was found that, although the use of vacuum consolidation in combination with vertical drains is effective in cases where it is necessary to limit the deformation of the surrounding ground, the same reduction in residual settlement can be achieved using vertical drains alone, provided that the drains are deployed at a sufficient frequency.

AB In north-west Europe, large areas of open peatland have been drained and planted with spatially homogenous stands of non-native conifers. The detrimental impact of afforestation on peatland carbon and biodiversity have led to large-scale attempts to restore these landscapes back to their open, tree-less form. The responses of dominant microbial consumers testate amoebae to peatland forest-to-bog restoration are largely unexplored. We studied changes in testate amoebae with forest-to-bog restoration in the largest expanse of blanket bog in the UK and compared testate amoeba communities in relatively undisturbed open bog with forested and forest-to-bog restoration sites. Forested areas contained testate amoeba communities which were functionally different from open bog, characterised by a lack of mixotrophic taxa known to contribute to primary production. Seventeen years after restoration management, the microbial communities in the forest-to-bog sites remained more similar to forested areas than to the open bog community. Our results suggest that afforestation has reduced the trophic level of testate amoeba communities, which are only beginning to recover post-restoration in the wettest areas where Sphagnum has re-colonized. This study also highlights the need to consider a wide-range of reference sites to encompass the natural variability within ombrotrophic blanket bog. We conclude that testate amoebae have the potential to act as functionally-significant bio-indicators in peatlands undergoing forest-to bog restoration.

AB We studied the effect of long-term water table drawdown on the vascular plant community in an ombrotrophic bog in central Finland by measuring aboveground biomass and belowground production (by in-growth cores) across plant functional groups including herbs, shrubs, and trees. We compared drained and undrained portions 45 years after the installation of a drainage ditch network, which has lowered water levels of 15-20 cm on average in the drained part of the site. Although shrub fine root production did not differ significantly between sites, water table drawdown increased belowground tree fine root production by 740% (3.8 +/- A 5.4 SD and 28.1 +/- A 24.1 g m(-2) y(-1) in undrained and drained sites, respectively) at the expense of herb root production, which declined 38% (27.62 +/- A 16.40 and 10.58 +/- A 15.7 g m(-2) y(-1) in undrained and drained sites, respectively) yielding no significant overall change in total fine root production. Drainage effects on aboveground biomass showed a similar pattern among plant types, as aboveground tree biomass increased dramatically with drainage (79 +/- A 135 and 2546 +/- A 1551 g m(-2) in drained and undrained sites, respectively). Although total shrub biomass was not significantly different between sites, shrubs allocated more biomass to stems than leaves in the drained site. Drainage also caused a significant shift in shrub species composition. Although trees dominated the aboveground biomass following water table drawdown, understorey vegetation, mainly shrubs, continued to dominate belowground fine root production, comprising 64% of total root production at the drained site. Aboveground biomass proved to be a good predictor of belowground production, suggesting that allometric relationships can be developed to estimate belowground production in these systems. Increase in tree root production can counteract decrease in herb fine root production following water table drawdown, emphasizing the importance of plant functional type responses to water table drawdown. Whether these changes will offset ecosystem C loss via increased plant C storage or stimulate soil organic matter decomposition via increased above- and belowground litter inputs requires further study.

AB Saxifraga hirculus is a postglacial relict in Central Europe, whose populations suffered a dramatic decrease in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, few researchers have been interested in its ecological requirements in Central Europe. This article synthesizes previous knowledge supplemented by original data from the last large population (Switzerland).
   S. hirculus is a weak competitor which needs precise ecological conditions. It grows on bryophyte carpets in neutral to slightly acid wetlands, with stable water table close to the soil surface (optimum between 8 and 14 cm) but does not stand long flooding. However, it requires a good oxygen supply, with roots 2-3 cm under the soil surface, generally not reached by water, with running, cold water through loose, fibric peat. Its optimal conditions are in spring fens, but it grows in other types of wetlands as well. However, overgrowing by shrubs, sedges or Sphagnum in natural successions may threaten the species with extinction, as did drainage and peat extraction previously. Now, its survival in Central Europe depends on an adequate management of the ecosystems. Moderate grazing (cattle or sheep) or mowing help to limit competition with taller Carex species. Reintroduction of disappeared populations or creation of new ones from cultivation in botanical garden is possible, but appropriate sites are rare. in some cases, substrate management could improve the conditions in somewhat inadequate situations. This management in four directions can be flexibly applied in different situations to progress to optimal conditions for the conservation of this valuable species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Boreal and subarctic peatlands comprise a carbon pool of 455 Pg that has accumulated during the postglacial period at an average net rate of 0.096 Pg/yr (1 Pg = 10(15) g).  Using Clymo's (1984) model, the current rate is estimated at 0.076 Pg/yr.  Long-term drainage of these peatlands is estimated to be causing the oxidation to CO2 of a little more than 0.0085 Pg/yr, with combustion of fuel peat adding almost-equal-to 0.026 Pg/yr.  Emissions of CH4 are estimated to release almost-equal-to 0.046 Pg of carbon annually.
   Uncertainties beset estimates of both stocks and fluxes, particularly with regard to Soviet peatlands.  The influence of water table alterations upon fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 is in great need of investigation over a wide range of peatland environments, especially in regions where permafrost melting, thermokarst erosion, and the development of thaw lakes are likely results of climatic warming.  The role of fire in the carbon cycle of peatlands also deserves increased attention.  Finally, satellite-monitoring of the abundance of open water in the peatlands of the West Siberian Plain and the Hudson/James Bay Lowland is suggested as a likely method of detecting early effects of climatic warming upon boreal and subarctic peatlands.

AB For soils with shallow groundwater and high organic carbon content, water table depth (WTD) is a key parameter to describe their hydrologic state and to estimate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Since the microwave backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)) is sensitive to soil moisture, the application of Sentinel-1 satellite data might support the monitoring of these climate-relevant soils at high spatial resolution (similar to 100 m) by detecting spatial and temporal changes in local field and water management. Despite the low penetration depth of the C-band, sigma(0) is influenced by shallow WTD fluctuations via the soil hydraulic connection between the water table and surface soil. Here, we analyzed sigma(0) at 60 monitoring wells in a drained temperate peatland with degraded organic soils used as extensive grassland. We evaluated temporal Spearman correlation coefficients between sigma(0) and WTD considering the soil and vegetation information. To account for the effects of seasonal vegetation changes, we used the cross-over (incidence) angle method. Climatologies of the slope of the incidence angle dependency derived from two years of Sentinel-1 data and their application to the cross-over angle method did improve correlations, though the effect was minor. Overall, averaged over all sites, a temporal Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.45 (+/- 0.17) was obtained. The loss of correlation during summer (higher vegetation, deeper WTD) and the effects of cuts and grazing are discussed. The site-specific general wetness level, described by the mean WTD of each site was shown to be a major factor controlling the strength of the correlation. Mean WTD deeper than about -0.60 m lowered the correlations across sites, which might indicate an important limit of the application.

AB The temperate peatlands are extensive, covering around 3.5 million km(2) of land. They contain about 455 Gt of carbon, almost equivalent to the carbon stored in all of the living things on the surface of the planet, and representing around 25% of all the soil carbon on earth. These bogs are a sink for atmospheric carbon and their carbon uptake accounts for about 12% of current human emissions. They vary considerably in their form and structure and are an important resource for scientific research, including the study of past environments and climate change, and they are also valuable in environmental education. They are low in biodiversity, but their fauna and flora are distinctive and many groups are confined to this habitat. For all these reasons, the future conservation of peatlands is a matter for concern. Threats to peatlands come from direct human exploitation in the form of peat harvesting for energy and horticulture, and drainage for forestry. Rising environmental awareness should control both of these processes in the western world, but continued northern peatland losses are likely locally, especially in Asia. Peatland drainage for forestry or agriculture will result in losses of carbon to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. Human population pressures, industrialization and urbanization are unlikely to have an important direct and immediate influence in the boreal zone. Fragmentation of the habitat is not an important consideration because bogs are by their very nature 'island' habitats. Acidification by aerial pollution may be a local problem close to sources, but the habitat is naturally acid and should not be severely affected, The input of aerial nutrients, however, particularly nitrogen, could have widespread impact on bogs, enhancing their productivity and altering their vegetation composition. The physical rehabilitation of bogs damaged by human activities presents many problems, particularly relating to the re-establishment of peat structure and vegetation, but the process can result in the re-formation of a carbon sink so it is worth the effort. Climate change is the most important consideration in its impact on bogs. Higher temperature (especially if accompanied by raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and increased nitrate deposition) will enhance productivity, but will also result in faster decomposition rates. The outcome of these opposing factors for peat formation will ultimately depend on the future pattern of precipitation. If, as seems most likely, summer conditions become warmer and drier in continental regions and winters become milder and wetter, the summer drought could cause peat loss and bog contraction. An excess of decomposition will lead to bogs becoming a carbon source and thus a positive feedback in global warming. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide would add to the greenhouse gas problem, but likely oxidation of methane and low N(2)O production may well mean that this impact will not prove to be significant. Tree invasion of bogs as a consequence of summer drought could locally lead to increased water loss through transpiration, and higher heat absorption through albedo change. This will enhance the drying effect on the bog surface. Oceanic mires will be less severely affected if the expected increase in precipitation takes place in these regions. The most important overall factor in determining the future of the northern bogs is likely to be the quantity and pattern (both spatially and temporally) of future precipitation in the zone.

AB In this study, we present a record spanning the last 4000 years from a Baltic bog (Kusowskie Bagno) in northern Poland. Using numerous biotic and abiotic proxies, such as testate amoebae (depth to water table reconstructions), stable carbon isotopes (C-13), plant macrofossils (proxies for local vegetation and mire surface wetness), pollen and spores (proxies for regional vegetation and human impact), we reconstructed and identified the regional hydro-climatic signal of Kusowskie Bagno bog and compared it to other bog records around the Baltic Sea. Our aims were to: 1) combine the species traits of bryophytes and testate amoebae, and more common proxies (isotopes, plant micro-and macro-remains) to infer past peatland development, 2) compare the hydroclimatic signal of Kusowskie Bagno bog to existing records around the Baltic Sea. We found that Kusowskie Bagno bog was very wet during the last 4000 years, and even drainage and peat exploitation had not disturbed its hydrology in northern part in the last 200 years. Carbon isotopes and plant macrofossils were significantly related to specific traits of testate amoebae, which in turn reflected the water table changes over the last 4000 years. Kusowskie Bagno recorded at least the following wet shifts: AD 250, 550, 850, 1250 and 1700, while wet conditions occurred during the Migration period at ca AD 550. Furthermore, the testate amoeba-based quantitative wetness reconstruction in Kusowskie Bagno bog resembles the pattern observed in other sites around the Baltic, i.e., Estonia, Finland, Ireland, northern Britain and the 7500-year record from the Stazki bog, northern Poland. Our results provided statistically validated evidence that interactions between plant and microbe need to be more considered further to reconstruct past hydrological. This is the first study of past hydro-climatic changes in peatlands based upon a trait-based approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Natural peatlands represent a long-term sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), however, drained and extracted peatlands can represent a source of atmospheric CO2. The restoration of Sphagnum mosses on abandoned milled peatlands has the potential to sequester atmospheric CO2 thereby returning the peatland to a peat accumulating system. Micrometeorological and chamber measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange are proven methods for investigating production and decomposition processes in both natural, extracted, and restored peatlands. However, this approach is relatively expensive because of infrastructure and human resources that not only limits potential use for ecological managers but it limits the number of sites that can be monitored due to high spatial variability. Here we present crank wire and destructive sampling production measurements, litter bag decomposition measurements and measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange made in a restored peatland and natural peatland sites nearby. The objectives were to assess production and decomposition rates in the two systems as well as to compare the different measurements techniques.
   Estimates of Sphagnum fuscum production at a restored peatland, using the different methods, followed the trend: crank wire < destructive sampling < gas exchange, with the two last methods providing comparable estimates. Production estimates using crank wires in cutover peat surfaces with a thin newly formed Sphagnum mat were shown unreliable due to peat subsidence. Results using the destructive sampling method suggest that Sphagnum production varies between species (S. fuscum > S. capillifolium) according to their ability to withstand harsh conditions on restored peat surfaces. Decomposition rate was also significantly greater (p < 0.05) for S. capillifolium than S. fuscum, resulting in an overall plant accumulation greater for S. fuscum. Although the restored surfaces were fairly young, production rates estimated on cutover surfaces that were fully covered with a thin Sphagnum mat compared with production rates observed in natural sites nearby.

AB Provision of broadly accessible and spatially referenced visualizations of the nature and rate of change in the Anthropocene is an essential tool in communicating to policy makers and to the wider public, who generally have little or no contact with academic publications and often rely on media-based information, to form and guide opinion. Three examples are used to demonstrate the use of geo-referenced data and GIS-based map compilations to provide accurate and widely accessible visual portrayals of historical processes. The first example shows the spread of Neolithic agriculture from Mesopotamia west and north across Europe over several millennia. The second plots the history of the drainage of the Fens (wetlands) in eastern England from the early seventeenth century onward. A third example illustrates one way in which releasing data in the public domain can lead to the enhancement of public data holdings. A concluding discussion outlines ways in which the methodology illustrated may be applied to processes key to understanding the Anthropocene.

AB This paper presents the results of the size of settlement in two stratigraphic sections and changes in morphology in four soil profiles between 1974 and 2012 in Polesie Lubelskie. The bed of peatlands classified as a low type, built reed peat with an mean depth of 3 m Sosnowica and 0.64 m Uhnin. The size of organic soil settlement measured surveying, is in the range of 9 cm to 33 cm, while mineral soils from 0 to 4 cm. The average size of settlement bog in Sosnowica was 24 cm in a period of 38 years, giving a reduction of 0.6 cm . year(-1), or peat weight loss of 11.5% of total resources. The situation is even worse in the case of peatland in Uhnin, where mineralization and fire peat bog area resulted in a decrease of 36%. Peat mass loss, due to fire, there was 53% of total resources, which corresponds to the reduction of 0.35 cm . year(-1). In period 50 years after dehydration is dominated by peat-muck soil a complex medium dry. The values of the correlation coefficient and the error rate indicates the inapplicability of empirical formulas for determining the size of the settlement.

ID IRON-MANGANESE CONCRETIONS; HEAVY-METALS; SOILS; SORPTION; NODULES
AB Based on the original and published data, the results of studying the properties, composition, genesis, and information significance of ferromanganese concretions in the soils of the taiga, broadleaved forest, and forest-steppe zones are summarized. The role of these neoformations in the field and analytical diagnostics of soils is analyzed. Some regularities of the changes in the chemical composition of ferromanganese concretions as related to the degree of the soil bogging or profile drainage were revealed. Under the regular increase in hydromorphism of the soils, the content of iron increases and that of manganese decreases. In this case, the ratio between the iron and manganese contents extracted by 1 N H(2)SO(4) also increases. This ratio was named the coefficient of bogging. This coefficient is used in practice to assess the expediency of drainage of mineral soils. The participation of ferromanganic concretions in the accumulation of macro- and micro-elements is shown. A model experiment has revealed that ferromanganese nodules can be formed during a rather short time (1-2 years).

AB 1. Peatlands are complex ecohydrological systems. In a theoretical modelling study we identify three ecohydrological links - commonly omitted from existing models - as potentially important to long-term peatland development, namely those between: I oxic-zone thickness and the rates of litter addition and depth-integrated decay; II time-integrated decay and hydraulic conductivity; and III drainage and peatland lateral expansion via paludification.
   2. In a simple model that includes none of these links, total peat thickness increases monotonically with annual rainfall, while oxic-zone thickness is controlled by the rates of litter addition and depth integrated decay.
   3. In an intermediate model that includes Link I, bi-stable behaviour occurs, with both 'dry' and 'wet' peatland forms possible at low rainfall, but only 'wet' peatland forms possible above a threshold value of rainfall. This finding agrees with those from a similar published model.
   4. In a more complicated model that includes both Link I and Link II, the bi-stability of the intermediate model is lost. Increases in net rainfall lead to little change in oxic-zone thickness because the model's feedbacks confer self-dampening (stabilizing) behaviour. Bog height after 5000 years is maximal at an intermediate anoxic decay rate, an initially counter-intuitive finding that reflects complex behaviour arising from the interacting feedbacks represented within the model.
   5. In a final model that includes Links I, II and a partial representation of Link III, the mode of peatland lateral expansion (i.e. linear, logarithmic or step-wise expansion) has a strong effect on patterns and rates of peat accumulation.
   6. Synthesis. Understanding long-term peatland development requires consideration of ecohydrological feedbacks; models without such feedbacks are likely to misrepresent peatland behaviour. Down-profile changes in peat properties, commonly taken to indicate external (climatic) influences in palaeoclimatic studies, may in some cases be consequences of internal peatland dynamics under a steady climate.

AB This article presents a reconstruction of the development of the ombrotrophic Gazwa peatland based on a high-resolution macrofossil analysis and AMS dating. Successional changes in the plant assemblages dominated by Sphagnum were influenced mainly by climate changes. Local fires occurred in the peatland, but did not have a substantial impact on the Sphagnum succession. The disappearance of the first stage of the ombrotrophic peatland, which was dominated by Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum angustifolium, resulted from a decrease in the water level that was also recorded at a number of sites in Europe in approximately 3750 BC. The development of Sphagnum fuscum/rubellum assemblages in approximately 350 BC corresponds with a climate cooling that resulted from low solar activity. The re-appearance of Sphagnum magellanicum in approximately AD 1650 corresponds with the Maunder Minimum of the Little Ice Age. The recent dominance of Sphagnum fallax is a result of the drainage of the peatland and of changes in the nearby vegetation. The paleoecology of Sphagnum contortum is also discussed. In the Gawa peatland, S. contortum occurred during two periods, 3700-3300 BC and 2850-2000 BC. The fossil occurrence of S. contortum in the Gazwa peatland corresponds with its modern ecological requirements in the northern hemisphere. S. contortum occurred in the rich fen phase with Carex lasiocarpa, Comarum palustre, Menyanthes trifoliata and Meesia triquetra. The disappearance of S. contortum is assumed to have been caused by a trophic shift and the succession of a more acidophilic species, Sphagnum obtusum.

AB Cultivated organic soils, which are a large source of CO2 emissions, are of particular interest in the Republic of Ireland where peatlands cover 20 % of the landscape. For accurate accounting and national reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there is a need to calculate the total land area used for cultivation activity on drained organic soils. Peatlands (organic soils) in Ireland are also used for arable farming, which results in particularly high greenhouse gas emissions per unit area. However, the Irish National Inventory Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change lacks mention of this type of land use. The actual area of organic soils under arable land use (cropland) in Ireland has, thus far, not been quantified. Here we provide a first estimate of the area of organic soil that is used for arable farming in Ireland. Through map overlay analysis using GIS in combination with probability sampling and ground truthing, we estimate the area of organic soils under arable cropping at 1,235 ha, which is considerably lower than the estimate of 3,688 ha based on map overlays alone. This research provides information to support improved accounting of organic soils under cultivation and may contribute to reducing uncertainty in national reporting of GHG emissions, thus providing a more reliable basis for strategies aimed at reducing GHG emissions in Ireland in the future.

AB Lycopodiella inundata expands its areal on the European North-East of Russia. In the subzone of the middle taiga of the Komi Republic in 2017-2018, four local populations of this species were found, associated with anthropogenic ecotopes, poor and acidic sands, or peat, varying in moisture regime. Obligatory satellites of L. inundata in plant communities are Drosera rotundifolia L. and Juncus filiformis L., mosses of the genera Sphagnum L. and Polytrichum Hedw. Its local populations are small, beyond protection areas of the Komi Republic and so are endangered. The life-form of the Lycopodiella inundata sporophyte is a spore variance of perennial plant with annual shoot system. This species prefers vegetative multiplication through natural winter morphological disintegration. For determine the population in the beginning of shoots growth, ramets are recommended to be counted. The paleo-geographic analysis makes it possible to exclude the relic nature of the present locations of L. inundata in the European North and allows one to classify the species as an allochthonous element of the flora. In view of the fact that the species is rare and tends to decrease its habitats worldwide, we included L. inundata into new edition of the Red Data Book of the Komi Republic with protection status category 3 (Rare). All habitation places of the species are out of specially protected areas of the republic and so are threatened. Limiting factors for this stenotopic species in the Komi Republic are its narrow ecological amplitude, low competitiveness, instability to violations of the hydrological regime (bogging or draining) and overgrowth of biotopes due to natural succession processes.

AB The effects of granulated and self-hardened wood ash on the nutrient status and stem growth of middle-aged Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands were studied at two upland and two peatland sites 13 years after ash application. The study sites were located in central Finland and represented different site fertility classes. The treatments consisted of an unfertilized control and two different doses of ash, 3 and 9 Mg ha(-1) (upland sites) or 5 and 15 Mg ha(-1) (peatland sites) on fresh weight basis, with both types of wood ash. All four sites had a similar experimental design following the principles of randomized blocks with four replications.
   The effect of ash treatments on the stand growth depended on the site type and ash dose. At the nutrient-poor upland site, the ash-induced response in the basal area growth was slightly positive and at the more fertile site slightly negative. However, in all cases the growth response at the upland sites was nonsignificant. At peatland sites, the ash applications increased stand growth remarkably, and the ash-induced basal area response strengthened with time, especially at the more fertile site. The high application rates resulted in stronger responses than the lower doses at the peatland sites. At the end of the study period, the annual basal area increment on the plots treated with the higher application rate of ash was 1.7-1.8-fold at the nutrient-poor site and 4-5-fold at the more fertile site compared with the control.
   While the trees in unfertilized control plots of peatland sites had sufficient (Site 3) or even an abundance of (Site 4) available N, they were suffering from severe P and K deficiencies (Site 4) or moderate K deficiency (Site 3). Higher dose of both ash types increased needle K concentrations at both peatland sites and that of P at Site 4 above the deficiency limit. At upland sites no nutrient deficiencies were found. All ash treatments increased needle B concentrations both at upland and peatland sites. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen dynamics were quantified for two years using N-15 (as NH,CI at 3 g N m(-2) year(-1)) in a bog and a rich fen in continental western Canada. After two years, 81-88% of the applied nitrogen was recovered; 98.4-98.7% of the recovered nitrogen occurred in the top 45 cm of the moss-peat layer and 1.3-1.6% occurred in the above ground shrub component In the bog, 29% was recovered from the top 0-5 cm of Sphagnum fuscum, while in the fen 19% was recovered from this zone in Tomenthypnum nitens. Sphagnum sequestered the applied nitrogen more efficiently than did Tomenthypnum. However, over time Tomenthypnum retained it better in the upper moss layers. Overall, after two years Sphagnum retained 42% and Tomenthypnum 48% in the top 12 cm of the ground layer. The nitrogen of the current year's moss growth contained 26-28% applied nitrogen (% NDFF) after one season and 19-20% after two seasons. Moss production increased from 4-30% annually over the two year period, while production for Betula pumila in the fen and Ledum groenlandicum in the bog did not increase significantly. Decomposition of S. fuscum in the bag was significantly less than T. nitens in the fen after two years, but no differences were evident after nitrogen additions in either peatlands. We conclude that I) nearly all nitrogen is immediately sequestered by the mass layer; 2) much of this new nitrogen is found in the actively growing region and mass production increases; 3) shrubs are little affected by the additional nitrogen during the first two years and direct absorption of nitrogen through leaves is unimportant and 4) newly deposited nitrogen is tightly controlled by the moss layer in both bogs and fens. However retention patterns are different. Subsequent use of nitrogen by vascular plants is determined by nutrient release through decompositional processes deeper in the moss layer.

AB In the near future, climate change will increasingly affect export of carbon (C) from peatlands. Terminal mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a source of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, CO2, and methane, CH4) for the atmosphere, and may contribute to climatic warming. Quantitative understanding of sources, dispersion pathways, and degradation of DOC produced in peat bogs is important for predictions of global change dynamics. Here we explore the potential of combining C isotope ratios of isotopically stratified, Pb-210-dated peat deposits and C isotope ratios of DOC exported via runoff to determine the depth and age of the predominant DOC source. In a poorly drained, Sphagnum-derived peat bog in the Czech Republic, delta C-13 values of bulk peat increased downcore to a depth of 10 cm. The C isotope signatures of fresh DOC and bulk peat differ only insignificantly, because C isotope changes in maturating peat require multiple microbial modifications of the organic matter taking place over relatively long time periods. Based on 41 samplings of runoff, 70% of exported DOC originated from peat substrate 1 to 10 years old, 2-10 cm deep. Recently photosynthesized DOC (< 1 year old) contributed about 5% to runoff DOC, whereas approximately 25% of exported DOC was derived from peat layers older than 10 years. Because biogenic methane at the study site contained isotopically extremely light C (delta C-13 values of -64.2 to -53.2 parts per thousand), it would seem reasonable to expect residual DOC following partial decomposition to become isotopically heavier. A short-term laboratory incubation of wet peat samples from four depths at mid-summer temperatures indicated more complicated delta C-13 systematics. The initial limited amount of DOC in the leachate was isotopically heavy, compared to bulk peat, but after 18 days delta C-13(DOC) became lower, converging to the C isotope signature of bulk peat. Such delta C-13 systematics can be explained by multi-step isotope effects associated with different reaction rates during substrate decomposition. Limitations of using the combination of within-bog delta C-13 systematics and Pb-210 dating of recent peat accretion are discussed. Horizontal heterogeneity in substrate C isotope signatures is one of the main sources of uncertainty of this approach to DOC source apportionment in peaty soils.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are highly variable in time, with high peak emissions lasting a few days to several weeks and low background emissions. This temporal variability is poorly understood which hampers the simulation of daily N2O emissions. In structured soils, like clay and peat, aggregates hamper the diffusion of oxygen, which leads to anaerobic microsites in the soil, favourable for denitrification. Diffusion of N2O out of the aggregates is also hampered, which leads to delayed emissions and increased reduction of N2O to N-2. In this model simulation study we investigate the effect of aggregates in soils on the N2O emissions. We present a parameterization to simulate the effects of aggregates on N2O production by denitrification and on N2O reduction. The parameterization is based on the mobile-immobile model concept. It was implemented in a field-scale hydrological-biogeochemical model combination. We compared the simulated fluxes with observed fluxes from a fertilized and drained peat soil under grass.
   The results of this study show that aggregates strongly affect the simulated N2O emissions: peak emissions are lower, whereas the background emissions are slightly higher. Including the effect of aggregates caused a 40% decrease in the simulated annual emissions relative to the simulations without accounting for the effects of aggregates. The new parameterization significantly improved the model performance regarding simulation of observed daily N2O fluxes; r(2) and RMSE improved from 0.11 and 198 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) to 0.41 and 40 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1), respectively. Our analyses of the model results show that aggregates have a larger impact on the reduction than on the production of N2O. Reduction of N2O is more sensitive to changes in the drivers than production of N2O and is in that sense the key to understanding N2O emissions from denitrification. The effects of changing environmental conditions on reduction of N2O relative to N2O production strongly depend on the NO3 content of the soil. More anaerobic conditions have hardly any effect on the ratio of production to reduction if NO3 is abundant, but will decrease this ratio if NO3 is limiting. In the first case the emissions will increase, whereas in the second case the emissions will decrease. This study suggests that the current knowledge of the hydrological, biogeochemical and physical processes may be sufficient to understand the observed N2O fluxes from a fertilized clayey peatland. Further research is needed to test how aggregates affect the N2O fluxes from other soils or soils with different fertilization regimes.

AB Obtainable woody biomass, stand density, and tree diameters were compared for a period of 13 years between grey alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench.) plantations where thinning was the treatment variable. The stands were growing on a drained sphagnum bog in east central Sweden and irrigated and fertilized during the growing seasons, except for the last 3 years. The thinning intensity was 44% and 13% of standing mass in the first and second thinning, respectively, in the stands concerned. About the same amount of obtainable biomass was produced in the thinned (T) and unthinned control (C) stands during the 13-year period, with MAI (mean annual increment derived from totally obtained biomass) above 0.40 kg woody dry matter m(-2) year(-1). A proper thinning regime striving at minimizing growth losses caused by either unutilized light or mortality was the main reason for the high biomass output from the T stands. The amount of standing biomass at the end of the study period was, however, larger in C than in T stands, whereas T stands had fewer but larger stems and less mortality. From this study it seemed possible that a thinning alternative for short rotation forests could give at least the same amount of obtainable biomass as unthinned stands, and this was most probably the combined result of a more efficient utilization of the biomass produced but a lower light interception by the canopy in T stands compared with C stands. Nevertheless, the increased value of the final harvest product must compensate for the costs of thinning if a thinning alternative should be of economic interest.

AB Manual closed-chamber measurements are commonly used to quantify annual net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE) in a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. However, differences in both the acquisition and gap filling of manual closed-chamber data are large in the existing literature, complicating inter-study comparisons and meta analyses. The aim of this study was to compare common approaches for quantifying CO2 exchange at three methodological levels. (1) The first level included two different CO2 flux measurement methods: one via measurements during mid-day applying net coverages (mid-day approach) and one via measurements from sunrise to noon (sunrise approach) to capture a span of light conditions for measurements of NEE with transparent chambers. (2) The second level included three different methods of pooling measured ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) fluxes for empirical modeling of R-ECO: campaign-wise (19 single-measurement-day R-ECO models), season-wise (one R-ECO model for the entire study period), and cluster-wise (two R-ECO models representing a low and a high vegetation status). (3) The third level included two different methods of deriving fluxes of gross primary production (GPP): by subtracting either proximately measured R-ECO fluxes (direct GPP modeling) or empirically modeled R-ECO fluxes from measured NEE fluxes (indirect GPP modeling). Measurements were made during 2013-2014 in a lucerne-clover-grass field in NE Germany. Across the different combinations of measurement and gap-filling options, the NEE balances of the agricultural field diverged strongly (-200 to 425gCO(2)-Cm-2). NEE balances were most similar to previous studies when derived from sunrise measurements and indirect GPP modeling. Overall, the large variation in NEE balances resulting from different data-acquisition or gap-filling strategies indicates that these methodological decisions should be made very carefully and that they likely add to the overall uncertainty of greenhouse gas emission factors. Preferably, a standard approach should be developed to reduce the uncertainty of upscaled estimates.

AB 1 Blanket mire in Northern Ireland is an ecologically threatened habitat in which land use for hand peat-cutting, forestry and agriculture has had a major influence. A recent land use change is the introduction of tractor-powered peat-harvesting. In this paper, the effect of machine peat-cutting on ombrotrophic blanket mire vegetation is assessed from a regional sample of cut and uncut plots.
   2 Principal components analysis identified watertable depth and grazing intensity as major factors influencing the species composition of uncut mire. A key variable affecting the composition of machine-cut mire across the drainage gradient was the number of times cut, with multiple annual cutting causing progressive decreases in acrotelm depth, catotelm bulk density and plant cover. Ericaceous species and Sphagnum spp. were particularly sensitive to cutting, with Eriophorum angustifolium and Campylopus introflexus characteristic of multiple-cut sites.
   3 Redundancy analysis, with number of times cut partialled out, showed that recovery time accounted for a significant amount of variance in vegetation composition. Species that significantly increased in abundance with recovery time were Sphagnum spp., Odontoschisma sphagni, Erica tetralix and Drosera rotundifolia.
   4 Sites cut frequently, or which were grazed, recovered more slowly. Recovery from cutting was partly dependent on the post-cutting structure of the mire surface and the species that survive cutting. The rate of recovery on sites cut once, then abandoned, is relatively rapid compared with multiple-cut sites where species colonization is constrained by bare compacted peat.

AB Although recent studies have recognized peatlands as a sink for atmospheric CO2, little is known about the role of Siberian peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We have estimated the Holocene peat and carbon accumulation rate in the peatlands of the southern taiga and subtaiga zones of western Siberia. We explain the accumulation rates by calculating the average peat accumulation rate and the long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) and by using the model of Clymo (1984, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B 303, 605-654). At three key areas in the southern taiga and subtaiga zones we studied eight sites, at which the dry bulk density, ash content, and carbon content were measured every 10 cm. Age was established by radiocarbon dating. The average peat accumulation rate at the eight sites varied from 0.35 +/- 0.03 to 1.13 +/- 0.02 mm yr(-1) and the LORCA values of bogs and fens varied from 19.0 +/- 1.1 to 69.0 +/- 4.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The accumulation rates had different trends especially during the early Holocene, caused by variations in vegetation succession resulting in differences in peat and carbon accumulation rates. The indirect effects of climate change through local hydrology appeared to be more important than direct influences of changes in precipitation and temperature. River valley fens were more drained during wetter periods as a result of deeper river incision, while bogs became wetter. From our dry bulk density results and our age-depth profiles we conclude that compaction is negligible and decay was not a relevant factor for undrained peatlands. These results contribute to our understanding of the influence of peatlands on the global carbon cycle and their potential impact on global change. (C) 2003 University of Washington.

AB A tundra vegetation consisting of at least 18 plant species is described from the Meyer Desert Formation which outcrops along the Beardmore Glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains, about 500 km from the South Pole. The fossils include pollen, seeds, fruits, flowers, leaves, wood, and in situ plants, of which wood and leaves of Nothofagus and a pollen assemblage had been previously reported. The plants include a cryptogamic flora of mosses and liverworts, conifers, and angiosperms in the families Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Nothofagaceae, Ranunculaceae, Hippuridaccae, ?Caryophyllaceae, and ?Chenopodiaceae or ?Myrtaceae. The plants grew in a weakly-developed soil formed within a complex periglacial environment that included moraines, glacial outwash streams, well-drained gravel ridges, and poorly drained depressions in which peat and marl were being deposited.

AB Energy pathways in stream food webs are often driven by allochthonous basal resources. However, allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is generally viewed as a minor if not insignificant basal resource because much of the DOC pool comprises high molecular weight, recalcitrant compounds and is inefficiently incorporated into biomass. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that the relatively small, labile fraction of DOC may indeed fuel microbial activity to a level that stimulates productivity across multiple trophic levels, resulting in a trophic upsurge. Here, we tested the trophic upsurge hypothesis by subsidising the labile DOC pool of an Alaskan boreal stream that had relatively high nutrient availability but low levels of naturally occurring DOC. We continuously added ecologically relevant (0.250 mg C/L, c. 10% increase above ambient bulk DOC) concentrations of labile DOC (acetate-C) for 62 days to a treatment reach that was statistically indistinguishable in its channel form and chemistry from an upstream reference reach. We measured responses of periphyton production and biomass, whole reach metabolism and nutrient uptake, benthic invertebrate abundances, and juvenile salmonid (Dolly Varden, Salvelinus malma) abundance and growth. Measurements of basal ecosystem responses collectively indicated increased energy mobilization at the base of the food web in response to labile DOC addition. Periphyton bacterial production in the treatment reach was generally >1.5x reference reach values, and periphyton ash-free dry mass, chlorophyll-a, and chlorophyll-a:ash-free dry mass were all greater in the treatment reach by the end of the study. Throughout dosing, ecosystem respiration was 1.3x greater in the treatment reach and dissolved inorganic nitrogen uptake was greater in the treatment reach on eight out of nine measurements. Benthic invertebrate counts, dominated by Baetis spp. and Chironomidae, were c. 4x greater after 28 dosing days and c. 8x greater after 56 days in the upstream portion of the treatment reach. Abundance generally declined with increasing distance from the dosing station. Dolly Varden fry and parr age classes were nearly 2x more abundant in the upstream portion of the treatment reach than in any section of the reference reach and also declined with increasing distance from the dosing station. Further, Dolly Varden tagged with passive integrated transponders prior to the experiment had significantly higher instantaneous growth rates in the treatment reach than those recaptured in the reference reach. The strong consumer responses to small quantities of labile DOC mirrored significant treatment reach increases in basal ecosystem function and therefore demonstrated a response consistent with a trophic upsurge. Terrestrial DOC has historically been viewed as contributing little to metazoan consumers, instead modulating the influence of nutrients and being respired out of a disconnected microbial loop. Because we dosed the treatment reach with a relevant concentration of labile DOC, based on measurements in nearby peatland-draining streams, we suggest that terrestrial DOC deserves more attention as a basal resource for whole food webs, akin to nutrients fuelling green (autochthonous) pathways.

AB Capsule: In the Scottish Highlands, Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix females with young broods selected areas rich in wet flushes, grasses and Sphagnum mosses.
   Aims: To identify associations between young Black Grouse broods and habitat characteristics.
   Methods: We located brood-rearing Black Grouse females in four areas of moorland-forest mosaic in the Scottish Highlands. Each brood was paired with a random reference location 100 m away. We recorded cover of different habitats and fine-scale vegetation and structure within squares of 1 and 0.25 ha, respectively. Associations between brood occurrence and habitat and vegetation variables were examined at the two scales.
   Results: Black Grouse broods were positively associated with wet flushes (1 ha), and with Heather Calluna vulgaris, sedges Carex spp., grasses, Sphagnum mosses and taller vegetation with intermediate levels of height variability (0.25 ha).
   Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of wet habitats for young Black Grouse chicks. In addition, relatively tall field-layer vegetation comprising Heather, sedges, grasses over a layer of Sphagnum mosses attracted brood-rearing Black Grouse females. Many management practices associated with peatland restoration, including drain-blocking, Sphagnum re-establishment and the avoidance of burning on deep peat soils, are therefore consistent with favourable habitat management for Black Grouse.

AB Pristine peatlands are carbon (C)-accumulating wetland ecosystems sustained by a high water table (WT) and consequent anoxia that slows down decomposition. Persistent WT drawdown as a response to climate and/or land-use change affects decomposition either directly through environmental factors such as increased oxygenation, or indirectly through changes in plant community composition. This study attempts to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of WT drawdown by measuring the relative importance of environmental parameters (WT depth, temperature, soil chemistry) and litter type and/or litter chemical quality on the 2-year decomposition rates of above- and belowground litter (altogether 39 litter types). Consequences for organic matter accumulation were estimated based on the annual litter production. The study sites were chosen to form a three-stage chronosequence from pristine (undrained) to short-term (years) and long-term (decades) WT drawdown conditions at three nutrient regimes. The direct effects of WT drawdown were overruled by the indirect effects through changes in litter type composition and production. Short-term responses to WT drawdown were small. In long-term, dramatically increased litter inputs resulted in large accumulation of organic matter in spite of increased decomposition rates. Furthermore, the quality of the accumulated matter greatly changed from that accumulated in pristine conditions. Our results show that the shift in vegetation composition as a response to climate and/or land-use change is the main factor affecting peatland ecosystem C cycle, and thus dynamic vegetation is a necessity in any model applied for estimating responses of C fluxes to changing environment. We provide possible grouping of litter types into plant functional types that the models could utilize. Furthermore, our results clearly show a drop in soil summer temperature as a response to WT drawdown when an initially open peatland converts into a forest ecosystem, which has not yet been considered in the existing models.

AB The pollen diagram from the Kobyle Jezioro raised bog, situated in the source area of the Tanew River in the Roztocze region, covers the whole Neoholocene. The deposit thickness ( about 3.5 m) has permitted high resolution pollen, peat (including macrofossils) and lithology analyses. Vegetational and palaeoenvironmental changes in this part of the Roztocze were recorded in pollen spectra and organic deposits. Palynological evidence shows the typical Neoholocene succession, which corresponds with the phenomena described from central Europe: from mixed deciduous forests at the decline of the climatic optimum, through hornbeam- and beech-dominated forests to pine forests. Peat accumulation in the Kobyle Jezioro peat-bog started during increased climatic humidity at the beginning of the Subboreal, and originally a fen peat was formed. Raised bog peat layers make up the uppermost 80 cm of the deposit. Within the fen deposits can be found layers of transitional peat, indicating short-term episodes of water deficiency in the early Subboreal phase (short-term climatic dryness) and towards its end (drainage of the bog resulting from the lowering of the groundwater table in the source area of the Tanew River). The growth of the raised bog started at the beginning of the climate deterioration in the Little Ice Age, and the unstable climatic conditions are reflected in the numerous periodical mineral (aeolian) material supplies in the developing ombrogenic bog. The accumulation of the younger section of transitional and raised peats during the Little Ice Age reflects the local hydrological changes in the source area of the Tanew River.

AB Rising levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition have been found to affect the primary productivity and species composition of most terrestrial ecosystems. Highly vulnerable ecosystems such as nutrient-poor bogs are expected to respond to increasing N input rates with a decrease in plant species diversity. Our study site - a moderately drained raised bog and one of only very few remaining protected peatland areas in Northwestern Germany - is surrounded by highly fertilised agricultural land and intensive livestock production. We quantified the annual deposition of atmospheric N over a period of two years. Dry deposition rates of different N species and their reactants were calculated from day and night-time concentrations measured by a RAPS denuder filter system. Dry N deposition amounted to 10.9 +/- 1.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (year 1) and 10.5 +/- 1.0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (year 2). More than 80% of total deposited N was attributed to ammonia (NH3). A strong seasonality in NH3 concentrations and depositions could be observed. Day and night-time concentrations and depositions, however, did not differ significantly. Total N deposition including bulk N deposition resulted in about 25 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Our results suggest that the intensive agricultural land management of surrounding areas and strongly emitting animal husbandry lead to N inputs into the protected peatland area that exceed the ecosystem's specific critical load up to fivefold. This gives rise to the assumption that a further shift in plant species composition with a subsequent alteration of the local hydrological regime can be expected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Numerous studies noted that the seed banks of drained former wet-meadows did not have enough residual seed potential for the successful restoration of species-rich fen-meadows. However, it is unclear whether a decline in groundwater level exerts a negative effect on the seed survival of wet-meadow plant species in the soil. This paper assessed the dependence of soil seed survival on different groundwater levels.
   We tested the influence of the groundwater level on the seed survival rate of 8 wet-meadow plant species in fen lysimeters with constant groundwater levels of 5, 30 and 70 cm. Seeds were buried in nylon mesh bags at 2 depths (5 and 25 cm), exhumed after 1, 3 and 5 years in the spring and tested in a climate chamber for germinable seeds under conditions of different day-night rhythms and fluctuating temperatures.
   At both burial depths, more viable seeds survived at lower groundwater levels compared with groundwater levels near the surface. Waterlogged conditions resulted in a significant reduction in the number of germinable seeds for most of the studied plant species. A cluster analysis divided the eight plant species into three groups which differed in soil seed bank persistence and tolerance towards soil wetness.
   The decline of the groundwater level due to fen-meadow drainage does not negatively affect the seeds of wet-meadow plant species. Our results also suggest that for some species, the classification of soil seed bank type may vary according to the groundwater level dynamic of the location.

AB An unusual cluster of 41 kettle holes occupies 3 km(2) on the surface of the Wrexham delta terrace, a glacial platform underlain by the Singret Member of the Wrexham Formation of Pleistocene (Late Devensian) age. Two coalescent kettle holes at Borras Bog constitute a natural obstacle on the route of the A5156 Llanypwll Link Road and posed difficulties for highway design and construction. Localised deposits of pear infill the kettle holes at Borras Bog and prompted concern about a potential subsidence problem within the area of highway construction. The method adopted to cross the kettle holes involved driving sheet piling along the boundaries of the construction corridor, excavating the pear from between the sheet pile walls and then infilling with granular material. Post-construction monitoring revealed two changes within the mire; first, the level of the bog has subsided at about 10 mm/y and secondly, birch woodland has invaded the central part of the mire. These changes indicate progressive dewatering of the kettle holes basin. Breaching of the clay floor of the basin is suspected to have induced drainage of the bog through the core of granular material. A remedial strategy is recommended to encourage the bog to recover. The main plank of the strategy entails grouting of the granular fill with bentonite slurry to seal the leakage points. In addition, the birch woodland growth should be cleared. However, the local community prefer the visual appearance of the flourishing new woodland and vigorously oppose the conservation measures. Deliberations continue on the optimum way forward.

AB Environmental and biological variables fluctuate over different time scales. On the basis of power spectral analysis of 14 time series at four sites from northern peatlands (fens and raised bogs), the temporal variability of physical environment (temperatures, water tables) and biological variables (CO2 flux) shows power-law behaviour, with a scaling exponent ranging from about 0.5 to 1.5. The scaling exponents of air temperatures change from 1.5 at high frequency to 0.5 at low frequency, with a break point at diurnal period. Comparison with similar analysis of temperature data from climate stations suggests that the atmosphere above peatlands has more active heat exchange with waterlogged peatlands than with upland terrestrial ecosystems. Water tables from different peatlands show almost identical power spectra, with a scaling exponent of 1.0 over all time scales. CO2 exchange has more complex spectral structure, with two break points at daily and monthly periods. This spectral structure suggests scale-dependent influence of climatic and hydrological fluctuations on CO2 fluxes. CO2 flux responds to air temperature with a distinct diurnal spectral peak. These results indicate that time scales are important in discussing hydrology and carbon dynamics in peatlands, and that scaling up of short-term experimental results may be inadvisable. Further statistical analysis on drained and harvested peatlands would provide insights into understanding shift in peatland dynamics due to human disturbance. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Anthropogenic activity is affecting the global climate through the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) e.g. CO2 and CH4. About a third of anthropogenic GHGs are produced from agriculture, including livestock farming and horticulture. A large proportion of the UK's horticultural farming takes place on drained lowland peatlands, which are a source of significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. This study set out to establish whether taising the water table from the currently used 50 cm to 30 cm could reduce GHGs emissions from agricultural peatlands, while simultaneously maintaining the current levels of horticultural productivity. A factorial design experiment used agricultural peat soil collected from the Norfolk Fens (among the largest of the UK's lowland peatlands under intensive cultivation) to assess the effects of water table levels, elevated CO2, and agricultural production on GHG fluxes and crop productivity of radish, one of the most economically important fenland crops. The results of this study show that a water table of 30 cm can increase the productivity of the radish crop while also reducing soil CO2 emissions but without a resultant loss of CH4 to the atmosphere, under both ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations. Elevated CO2 increased dry shoot biomass, but not bulb biomass nor root biomass, suggesting no immediate advantage of future CO2 levels to horticultural farming on peat soils. Overall, increasing the water table could make an important contribution to global warming mitigation while not having a detrimental impact on crop yield. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB In a small, extensively artificially drained lowland catchment (15.5 km(2)) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (North-Eastern Germany), the dynamics and the extent of P-t and PO4-P losses as well as the discharge were monitored at different scales for three six-months winter seasons. Average phosphorus concentrations in the discharge of a collector drain, a ditch draining arable land and a small brook were with 0.036 to 0.044 mg/l P-t and 0.030 to 0.037 mg/l PO4-P low. Elevated concentrations occurred during intensive snowmelt events. Probably due to the re-mobilisation of phosphorus under anaerobic conditions, concentrations (0.137 mg/l P-t and 10,076 mg/l PO4-P) in a ditch draining grassland on degraded peat were significantly higher than at the other sites dominated by mineral soils. As expected, the phosphorus losses were with a maximum of 270 g/(ha . 6 month) Pt and 211 g/ (ha . 6 month) PO4-P low.

AB Top-soil removal followed by species introduction through hay transfer has appeared as a method to restore drained fens. This method addresses abiotic constraints by restoring hydrology and nutrient status, and biotic constraints by removing an unwanted seed bank and counteracting dispersal-limitation. Restoration works by altering environmental filters. Knowledge about the restoration actions effect on functional traits is necessary to understand which types of species may establish. In this study we analyse which factors in top-soil removal followed by hay transfer influence selection and composition of functional traits. Top-soil removal followed by hay transfer from reference sites was conducted at two sites in the Calowanie fen, 33 km SE of Warsaw, Poland. Species and abundance data were recorded for three consecutive years. These data, combined with data on functional traits were used to analyse the effect of the restoration actions on four functional diversity-indices and the community weighted mean of functional traits. Our results reveal a strong habitat filter in the restoration site that follows an elevation gradient. At low elevation this filter selects low values of autochory and specific leaf area and high values of clonal lateral spread, Ellenberg moisture values, and dispersal through hydrochory. The transferred hay differs in trait characteristics compared to the reference site vegetation by having species of higher specific leaf area, lower Ellenberg moisture value and lower dispersal by autochory and hydrochory. The result presented here has three important implications for fen restoration. First, the difference in trait-characteristics between the transferred hay and the reference site it was harvested from limits the restoration potential. Second, since for several fen species important functional traits are filtered along an elevation-gradient, careful planning regarding depth of top-soil removal is needed. Finally the results illustrate how a functional analysis can be used to detect environmental filters acting during ecological restoration. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The present study makes use of a detailed water balance to investigate the hydrological status of a peatland with a basal clay-rich layer overlying an aquifer exploited for drinking water. The aim is to determine the influence of climate and groundwater extraction on the water balance and water levels in the peatland. During the two-year period of monitoring, the hydrological functioning of the wetland showed a hydric deficit, associated with a permanent unsaturated layer and a deep water table. At the same time, a stream was observed serving as a recharge inflow instead of draining the peatland, as usually described in natural systems. Such conditions are not favourable for peat accumulation. Field investigations show that the clay layer has a high hydraulic conductivity (from 1.10(-7) to 3.10(-9) m.s(-1)) and does not form a hydraulic barrier. Moreover, the vertical hydraulic gradients are downward between the peat and the sand aquifer, leading to high flows of groundwater through the clay layer (20-48% of the precipitation). The observed hydric deficit of the peatland results from a combination of dry climatic conditions during the study period and groundwater extraction. The climatic effect is mainly expressed through drying out of the peatland, while the anthropogenic effect leads to an enhancement of the climatic effect on a global scale, and a modification of fluxes at a local scale. The drying out of the peatland can lead to its mineralisation, which thus gives rise to environmental impacts. The protection of such wetlands in the context of climate change should take account of anthropogenic pressures by considering the wetland-aquifer interaction.

AB For policy making and spatial planning, information is needed about the impacts of climate change on natural ecosystems. To provide this information, commonly hydrological and ecological models are used. We give arguments for our assessment that modelling only is insufficient for determining the impacts of climate changes on natural ecosystems at regional scales. Instead, we proposed a combination of hydrological simulations, a literature review and process-knowledge on climate-hydrology-vegetation interactions, to compile a sketch map that indicates climate change effects on a number of ecosystems in the Netherlands. Soon after a first version of our sketch map was published by a Dutch professional journal, copies appeared in policy documents, and also in a commercial and popular atlas of the Netherlands. Moreover, the map led to a question in the Dutch parliament about the sustainability of bog reserves under the future climate. Apparently, there was an urgent need for the information provided by the map.
   The map shows that climate change will presumably have the largest influence on ecosystems in the Netherlands that depend on precipitation as the major water source, like heathlands, dry grasslands, rain-fed moorland pools and raised bogs. Also highly susceptible are fens in reserves surrounded by deeply drained polders, because such fens depend on the inlet of surface water, of which quality is likely to deteriorate upon climate change. While the map is indicative for directions of change, in view of the uncertainties of our study, no conclusions should be drawn that may have far-reaching consequences, such as giving up certain nature targets that might no longer be feasible in the future climate. Instead, we advise to anticipate the potential threats from climate change by taking a number of adaptation measures that enhance the robustness of nature reserves.
   To improve climate change projections on hydrology and ecosystems, future research should especially focus on feedbacks of vegetation on the water balance, on processes that directly influence plant performance and on the ecological effects of weather extremes.

AB It is commonly assumed that agricultural peatlands are net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere because of lowered water tables and intensive land management altering the balance of plant productivity and respiration. Yet actual farm-scale fluxes of CO2 have been infrequently quantified. We measured net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) using a permanent and a mobile eddy covariance tower installed over dairy farms with year-round rotational grazing on deep peats in New Zealand. The permanent tower was in place for one year and the mobile tower was deployed for periods of 3-4 weeks at three other farms on peat between spring and autumn. At all sites, grazing cycles caused large variations in pasture biomass and consequent daytime NEE and we accounted for these variations using an index of photosynthesising biomass (phytomass index, Lohila et al., 2004) automatically derived from daily CO2 flux measurements. We estimated annual CO2 loss of 190 gC m(-2)yr(-1) for the permanent site, which is in broad agreement with other agricultural peatland studies. Including other farm-scale exports of C, overall net ecosystem carbon loss estimated for the permanent site was 294 gC m(-2) yr(-1). Accounting for changes in phytomass index, daytime NEE was similar for permanent-mobile site farm pairings, except when there were very large differences in water table depths between farms in autumn. In contrast, night-time respiration losses were almost identical between farms even when water tables were markedly different, suggesting that spatial differences in NEE in these agricultural peatlands are caused by reduced photosynthesis in dry periods, due to plant water stress, rather than increased respiration. Comparisons between permanent and mobile towers appeared a useful approach for determining spatial variability of CO2 fluxes from peat soils. Taken together, our results suggested that the CO2 losses measured at the permanent site were representative of CO2 losses for farmed peats in the Waikato region when the water table was within similar to 0.5 m of the surface. Where water tables were deeper net CO2 losses would be expected to be greater due to reduced pasture photosynthesis and production. Maintaining higher water tables might achieve dual benefits of increasing pasture productivity and reducing CO2 losses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ostracod diversity and abundance was studied in 10 different types of water bodies of Belarus (bogs, brooks, canals, oxbows, ponds, reservoirs, rivers, springs, shoal of lake and temporary pools). Hydrochemical variables, sediment, and vegetation were analyzed. In total 156 different localities were investigated. Habitat diversity was based mainly upon the closely correlated hydrochemical variables of mineralization (hardness total and carbonate, conductivity, total value of dissolved substances), although bottom, vegetation characteristics and other factors (pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients) were also significant. The ostracods found included 62 species in 27 genera comprising 8 cosmopolitan, 17 Holarctic, 13 Palearctic species; 21 of these species are known from central and southern Europe and adjacent areas, while 3 are characteristic for eastern Europe. The distribution of freshwater ostracod assemblages reflected the habitat and depended on water body type. Heterogeneous oxbows and temporary pools supported 37 species, while other types of pool maintained only 27-14 species. The population density of different species varied from 0.5 to more than 10 000 ind./m(2) Indices of local alpha diversity were significantly correlated with the number of species and temperature and were maximal in heterogeneous habitats. The variation of population density was not connected with habitat patterns but appeared to be regulated by the biotic interactions in the community. Habitat diversity, verified by the beta-diversity indices, enabled us to find localities with a similar heterogeneity level and species richness. Beta-diversity values were independent of species number as well as abundance but a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) was found with temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen. This index probably reflected the general patterns of different localities.

AB Many high-elevation wetlands have been degraded by activities related to the skiing industry. However, few studies exist on their restoration in this harsh environment. From 2010 to 2017, we set up an experiment on a degraded bog located at 2500 m within the ski resort of Val-Thorens (France). We tested (1) if transplanting two sedge species, Trichophorum cespitosum and Eriophorum scheuchzeri effectively helped to initiate the restoration of the bog vegetation and (2) if different planting combinations of the species under different mulch treatments affected transplant survival and cover. After stabilising the bare peat with wood fascines and installed weirs in the incised gully that drained the bog, we planted tussocks of T. cespitosum and ramets of E. scheuchzeri, each alone or in mixture. We used straw mulch or a "biomulch" made of live shoots of Polytrichum moss. After a slight increase the first 2 years, the number of E. scheuchzeri ramets decreased continuously in all treatments and reached zero in 2016. T. cespitosum had a low mortality in all treatments; its annual survival rate and cover were significantly higher with biomulch. Because of strong winds and snow action, all the straw was removed after 2 years while the biomulch cover remained between 10 and 25% from the third to the fifth year then was close to zero from 2016. Nevertheless, this low cover seemed sufficient to favour the survival and growth of T. cespitosum. In 2017, bare soil was lower in all treatments with biomulch and T. cespitosum. This treatment appears to be the best restoration option, but it is likely that more than 7 to 10 years will be required to establish adequate plant cover at degraded high-elevation sites.

AB The influence of forest stand age in a Picea sitchensis plantation on (1) soil fluxes of three greenhouse gases (GHGs - CO2, CH4 and N2O) and (2) overall net ecosystem global warming potential (GWP), was investigated in a 2-year study. The objective was to isolate the effect of forest stand age on soil edaphic characteristics (temperature, water table and volumetric moisture) and the consequent influence of these characteristics on the GHG fluxes. Fluxes were measured in a chronosequence in Harwood, England, with sites comprising 30- and 20-year-old second rotation forest and a site clearfelled (CF) some 18 months before measurement. Adjoining unforested grassland (UN) acted as a control. Comparisons were made between flux data, soil temperature and moisture data and, at the 30-year-old and CF sites, eddy covariance data for net ecosystem carbon (C) exchange (NEE). The main findings were: firstly, integrated CO2 efflux was the dominant influence on the GHG budget, contributing 93-94% of the total GHG flux across the chronosequence compared with 6-7% from CH4 and N2O combined. Secondly, there were clear links between the trends in edaphic factors as the forest matured, or after clearfelling, and the emission of GHGs. In the chronosequence sites, annual fluxes of CO2 were lower at the 20-year-old (20y) site than at the 30-year-old (30y) and CF sites, with soil temperature the dominant control. CH4 efflux was highest at the CF site, with peak flux 491 +/- 54.5 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and maximum annual flux 18.0 +/- 1.1 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1). No consistent uptake of CH4 was noted at any site. A linear relationship was found between log CH4 flux and the closeness of the water table to the soil surface across all sites. N2O efflux was highest in the 30y site, reaching 108 +/- 38.3 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) (171 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)) in midsummer and a maximum annual flux of 4.7 +/- 1.2 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2001. Automatic chamber data showed a positive exponential relationship between N2O flux and soil temperature at this site. The relationship between N2O emission and soil volumetric moisture indicated an optimum moisture content for N2O flux of 40-50% by volume. The relationship between C : N ratio data and integrated N2O flux was consistent with a pattern previously noted across temperate and boreal forest soils.

AB The initial question of any ecological restoration project should be whether the degraded ecosystem may recover spontaneously in a reasonable time period or active intervention is needed. We examined the successional trajectories of vegetation within peatlands exploited by the traditional block-cut technique in Eastern Canada, with the final purpose of identifying sites which need human intervention to ensure the return of a typical Sphagnum-dominated bog community that accumulates C. Ordinations showed that the development of vegetation was different between three block-cut peatland regions. Peatlands of one of the regions were initially colonized by tall, dense ericaceous shrubs. There, communities tended to become increasingly dominated by trees and understories were closing over time, therefore not being on a trajectory toward the recovery of a Sphagnum-dominated system that accumulates peat in the future. Intervention is therefore recommended, for example by blocking still active drainage ditches. In the peatlands of the other two regions, Sphagnum had a high initial cover and remained dominant ten years later. However, species typically found in hummocks gained relative importance vs. those associated to hollows. More time is needed to decide whether these sites could be left unmanaged as they have remained after their abandonment 35 years ago.

AB Hydrological response to climate change may alter the biogeochemical role that peatlands play in the global climate system, so an understanding of the nature and magnitude of this response is important. In 2002, the water table in a fen peatland near Quebec City was lowered by similar to 20 cm (Experimental site), and hydrological response was measured compared to Control (no manipulation) and Drained (previously drained c. 1994) sites. Because of the draw-down, the surface in the Experimental pool decreased 5, 15 and 20 cm in the ridge, lawn and mat, respectively, increasing bulk density by similar to 60% in the Experimental lawn. Hydraulic conductivity (K) generally decreased with depth and from Control (25-125 cm) 10(-1) to 10(-5) cm s(-1) to Experimental (25-125 cm) 10(-2) to 10-7 cm s(-1) and to Drained (25-75 cm) 10(-2) to 10(-6) cm(-6) s(-1). In similar topographic locations (ridge, lawn, mat), K trended Control > Experimental > Drained, usually by an order of magnitude at similar depths in similar topographic locations. Water table fluctuations in the Drained site averaged twice those of the Control site. The water table in the Control lawn remained at a stable depth relative to the surface (similar to - 1 cm) because the lawn peat floats with changes in water table position. However, the Drained lawn peat was more rigid because of the denser degraded peat, forcing the water to fluctuate relative to the surface and further enhancing peat decay and densification. This provides a positive feedback loop that could intensify further peat degradation, changing the carbon cycling dynamics. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Harvest residue decomposition can significantly contribute to nutrient and heavy metal exports to receiving water courses. This study monitors the nutrient and heavy metal dynamics in decaying Sitka spruce and lodgepole pine harvest residue needles on Atlantic blanket peat forests in the west of Ireland. Using the litterbag method, harvest residue was placed both within and between furrows in two uncut forest and two clear-cut sites. On the clear-cut sites, the litterbags were positioned outside the harvest residue piles (i.e. brash windrows). Over the 2-year monitoring period, the needles decomposed slower at the clear-cut sites than the uncut forest sites, with mass losses of 46-55 and 58-77 %, respectively. Approximately 20 % less phosphorous (P) was released from the decaying needles at the clear-cut sites, while nitrogen (N) was released only at the uncut sites. Tree species was a significant factor contributing to nutrient and heavy metal release and accumulation patterns, with higher concentrations of aluminium (Al), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in the decaying spruce needles than in pine. Conversely, the spruce needles showed accelerated depletion of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) relative to the pine. The harvest residue needle positioning (inside furrow/between furrows) and the site soil characteristics contributed significantly to Al transformations in spruce needles and iron (Fe) in both spruce and pine needles, with more accumulation occurring inside the furrows where Al and Fe contents of the peat were high. Manganese (Mn) was released from the needles in three of the four sites with a total release of over 90 % within 2 years. In the remaining site, where the Mn content of the peat was high, an accumulation of Mn in the needles was observed. The decomposition of needles on blanket peat catchments may be a significant source of P to receiving water courses, owing to their fast release of P, but not a likely source for N export.

AB The preferential movement of water and transport of substances play an important role in soil, but they are not yet fully understood, especially in degraded peat soil. In this study, we aimed to deduce changes in flow and transport patterns with titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a dye tracer during the course of soil degradation resulting from peat drainage. The dye tracer experiments were carried out on columns of eight types of differently degraded peat soil from three sites taken in both vertical and horizontal directions. The titanium dioxide suspension (average particle size of 0.3 mu m; 10gl(-1)) was applied in a pulse of 40mm to each soil core. The cores were subsequently cut into six slices, photographed and the images were analysed for the extent of dye cover and number of pores. In addition, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) was determined. Preferential flow occurred in all of the peat types investigated. From the stained soil structural elements, we concluded that undecomposed plant remains are the major preferential flow pathways in less degraded peat. For more strongly degraded peat, bio-pores, such as root and earthworm channels, operated as the major transport network. Results show that K-s and the effective pore network in less degraded peat soil are anisotropic. With increasing peat degradation, K-s and the cross-section of effective pores decreased in the predominant direction only and the anisotropy of both properties decreased. The K-s was closely related to the number of macropores and pore continuity. Therefore, we conclude that changes in flow and transport pathways and K-s with increasing peat degradation result from the disintegration of the peat-forming plant material and the decrease in number and continuity of macropores.
   We aimed to deduce changes in flow and transport patterns during peat degradation.
   TiO2 (dye tracer) was used to visualize the flow and transport patterns in degraded peat soil.
   The preferential flow paths, K-s and pore structures changed with peat degradation.
   Changes in flow and transport paths and K-s relate to peat-forming plant materials and pore structure.

AB Afforested peatlands account for about 25 % of human-affected peatlands worldwide. In some regions, particularly the British Isles, forest-to-bog conversions are now underway in the hope of increasing carbon storage and restoring original ecosystem functions. In this study, the effects on surface water quality of forest-to-bog restoration in the Flow Country peatlands of northern Scotland were monitored during 15 months. The hydrochemistry of rainwater, resurgence ground water, forestry drainage ditch water, open bog surface water, forestry-influenced loch water and stream water was examined before, during and after felling. The seasonal cycles of biologically active (C, Si, P) and organically complexed (Fe, Al) elements were characterised by major changes in concentration. The felling operations amplified these effects due to (i) the decomposition of felling residues (leaching K and C) and (ii) the disturbance and partial mineralisation of shallow peat soils (releasing P, Fe and Al). Shorter term changes (1-10 days) produced by rainfall events and associated changes in hydrological flow paths controlled the concentrations of Na, Ca, Mg, Mn, and to a lesser extent K and Al. There were significant negative correlations with flow of [K], [Ca] and [Mg] but a positive correlation between stream flow and [Al]. Concentration-flow relationships were not significantly altered by the felling operations because of the relatively low volume of water released from the felled area. Fluctuations in the water table represented another important control of surface water composition. Resurgence waters produced high [Fe] and [Si] values when water table levels were low. These contributions were diluted with runoff and surface soil waters enriched in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) when levels rose. Sequential ultrafiltration revealed that Fe, C and P co-occurred in the > 30 kDa molecular weight fraction in constant relative concentrations. Since forest-to-bog restoration raises the water table, it can be anticipated to result initially in more intense flushing of DOC, including the > 30 kDa molecular weight fraction where Fe and P co-occur.

AB Peatlands are globally important areas for carbon preservation; although covering only 3% of global land area, they store 30% of total soil carbon. Lowland peat soils can also be very productive for agriculture, but their cultivation requires drainage as most crops are intolerant of root-zone anoxia. This leads to the creation of oxic conditions in which organic matter becomes vulnerable to mineralisation. Given the demand for high quality agricultural land. 40% of the UK's peatlands have been drained for agricultural use.
   In this study we present the outcomes of a controlled environment experiment conducted on agricultural fen peat to examine possible trade-offs between celery growth (an economically important crop on the agricultural peatlands of eastern England) and emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) at different temperatures (ambient and ambient +5 degrees C), water table levels (-30 cm, and -50 cm below the surface), and fertiliser use.
   Raising the water table from -50 cm to -30 cm depressed yields of celery, and at the same time decreased the entire ecosystem CO2 loss by 31%. A 5 degrees C temperature increase enhanced ecosystem emissions of CO2 by 25% and increased celery dry shoot weight by 23% while not affecting the shoot fresh weight. Fertiliser addition increased both celery yields and soil respiration by 22%. Methane emissions were generally very low and not significantly different from zero.
   Our results suggest that increasing the water table can lower emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce the rate of peat wastage, but reduces the productivity of celery. If possible, the water table should be raised to -30 cm before and after cultivation, and only decreased during the growing season, as this would reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions and peat loss, potentially not affecting the production of vegetable crops.

AB Globally 15%, and in Europe over 50%, of all peatlands have been drained for agricultural use leading to high carbon (C) losses, severe land subsidence and increased flooding risks. For the restoration of C sequestration and peat formation, abandoned peatlands are being rewetted at a large scale, but this transforms them into strong methane (CH4) sources. Furthermore, due to the high topsoil nutrient contents and/or high buffering capacities of water used for rewetting, this will inevitably result in eutrophication of restored peatlands and downstream areas, which may compromise the regrowth of peat forming vegetation including Sphagnum spp.
   To experimentally determine the extent of these negative side effects in relation to water quality, and to test topsoil removal as an abatement strategy, we used a controlled laboratory approach in which topsoil and subsoil monoliths of a former agricultural peatland were rewetted with water of different qualities (+P, +HCO3-, +P/+HCO3- and Control), mimicking rainwater vs. surface water storage. In addition, two different Sphagnum moss species (S. squarrosum and S. palustre) were compared.
   Without topsoil removal, rewetting led to high P and N mobilisation, algal blooms, and high CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) emissions. P-rich water resulted in further eutrophication. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) enrichment by surface water not only stimulated P release and CO2 emission, but also strongly reduced Sphagnum vitality.
   We conclude that topsoil removal will, at least in initial stages of rewetting, strongly reduce eutrophication problems (by 80-90%), CH4 emission (99%), DOC loss (60%) and global warming potential (50-70%) of rewetted former agricultural peatlands. Furthermore, to reduce mineralisation rates and enable Sphagnum growth, storage of rainwater rather than surface water is preferred. Finally, removed topsoils can be reused in adjacent subsiding agricultural areas, and thereby optimise the overall C balance and allow higher water levels in rewetted peatlands.

AB Peatlands are important contributors of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to downstream aquatic systems. We investigated the effects of storm events on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM quality in a stream draining a Welsh peatland catchment. Intensive stream samples were collected and analysed for pH, DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), absorbance and fluorescence. Soil water samples and samples of sphagnum pore water were also collected, and a simple end-member mixing model was applied to account for changes occurring during the events. Fluorescence data were interpreted using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). DOC concentrations increased and pH decreased during the storm events. The soil water data and the mixing model indicated that this was due to a change of flow paths and draining of the DOC-rich acrotelm. Absorbance indices and the DOC/DON ratio suggested that the DOM released during events was less degraded. There was a striking, inversely related diurnal pattern in absorbance and fluorescence after the discharge peak. The diurnal pattern and a lack of fit with the mixing model suggested that fluorescing DOM was mainly produced in-stream. Fluorescence has been found to peak in the morning and decline during day-time due to photo-bleaching. We hypothesise that the input of additional DOM during events causes a change in the diurnal pattern, giving a peak at mid-day, when the processing of the additional DOM is highest.

AB Internal water storage and water exchanges that sustain hydration are critical for the physiological function of Sphagnum mosses that have recolonized cutover peatlands characterized by low soil-water pressures. The relative importance of water gains and losses for spontaneously regenerated Sphagnum moss cushions was addressed through investigation of the sensitivity of moss moisture dynamics to a range of environmental variables. Precipitation waters are poorly retained within the cushions, which indicated that rain event water can only be relied upon by the mosses for a short period. The relationship between water table depth and moisture content within moss cushions was strong when the water table was within 30cm of the surface of the cutover peat but weakened as conditions became drier, as reflected by weakened upward hydraulic gradients in the unsaturated zone below the moss cushions. Calculation of a water budget between 19 May and 16 August 2006 for relatively wet and dry cushions, respectively, identified a water deficit of 28 and 44mm. It is hypothesized that additional (small) sources of water during deficit conditions may be critical for maintaining physiological processes. Rewetting of the peatland by blocking drainage ditches created conditions more favourable for Sphagnum survival through increasing the moisture content and soil-water pressures within the remnant peat deposit although restoration efforts should aim to constrain the water table position to within the upper 30cm.

AB This study was conducted to assess the nitrogen removal potential of a minerotrophic peatland in Northern Germany, where hydrological conditions were partly restored in the beginning of the 1990s. Actual denitrification and the effect of nitrate (NO3-) and glucose additions on denitrification rates were determined in two flooded and one drained histosols in spring and summer 1998. In the flooded soils, denitrification was insignificant, but the drained field emitted significant rates. Additions of NO3- stimulated denitrification at all sites in spring and summer, whereas glucose additions had no effect. Low NO3- concentration in floodwater was obviously limiting denitrification in the flooded soils. In the drained soil, a coupled nitrification/denitrification might explain the low, but significant denitrification rates. No spontaneous production of nitrous oxide occurred in the flooded soils, whereas at the drained site an increase in spontaneous nitrous oxide concentration was measured during incubation in the summer samples. The suggested introduction of NO3- rich water from a stream flowing through the area would apparently induce denitrification in the flooded fields.

DE avifauna; formation; Abkhazia; Colchis
AB The avifauna of Colchis landscapes of (Abkhazia) nearby Pitsunda cape serves as a convenient model for studying the features and regularities of the transformation of the biota on the Black Sea coast during the historical period. In this region, 232 bird species, including 98 nesting species, were registered. Among the breeding birds, dendrophilous ones amount to 61.2%; limnophilous, 21.4; sklerophilous 13.3; and kampophilous birds, only 4.1%. The predominance of dendrophilous birds is characteristic for all the Colchis districts and appears to be primary for this region. This fact determined the very low diversity of its fauna in the past. Representatives of other ecological groups gradually colonized the Colchis in the process of its development by people, cutting of dense moist forests, drainage of bogs and emergence of pastures, hayfields, fields, and building constructions on the Black Seacoast. During the twentieth century the beginning of the twenty-first century, 33 new bird species were identified in Pitsunda, and the average rate of their immigration accounted for 3.1 species per 10 years. The rate of disappearance of nesting birds for this period was determined as 0.8 species per 10 years. As the current colonization fund is 32 species, the final settling of Pitsunda will require about 100 years more. At the beginning of the twenty-second century, the total breeding fauna in this region will consist of about 125 species. The author discusses the influence of various anthropogenous and natural factors on the immigration and disappearance of birds and adaptation processes in bird populations.

AB In the organic-rich environments of peatlands and peaty riparian zones, dissolved organic matter (DOM) can act as a carrier for major and trace elements. However, the mobilization and export patterns of elements from these systems are largely unknown. This study elucidates the annual and short-term event-based dynamics of major and trace element concentrations in a headwater stream draining an ombrotrophic peatland and a peaty riparian zone. Elements are expected to exhibit specific export patterns depending on their biogeochemical reactivity and source area. We hypothesize that most elements are released during organic matter decomposition and are co-transported with DOM in the bog catchment, whereas in the riparian zone, other element pools, such as shallow groundwater, also play a major role.
   Most of the variance in the data, as revealed by Principal Component Analysis, integrated the DOM concentration pattern (element loadings > 0.8: Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn, Li, Co, As, Sr, Cd, Pb, and DOC). Ca, Mg and Sr were also found to load on this principal component, suggesting that the main control on element mobilization is not DOM, but rather similar source areas and mobilization processes. The DOM-related export was driven by plant uptake, plant decomposition and the bog water level in terms of hydrologic connectivity. The differences between the bog and the riparian zone were mainly driven by different hydrologic conditions and additional elemental sources, such as mineral weathering. The export patterns of Rb, Cs, K, NO3- and SO42- were predominantly controlled by the season and plant uptake, and they were particularly exported by a surficial fast flow path. In addition to other elements, Ga, Y and Ba were enriched in the upper peat and organic soil layer, likely due to anthropogenic pollution. The specific export pattern of these latter elements indicates their predominant mobilization by the dissolution of dust particles and their subsequent mobilization by coupling to DOM.

AB Hyporheic exchange is important in increasing stream water transit time through basins and enhancing redox-sensitive biogeochemical reactions influencing downstream water quality. Such exchange may be enhanced by beaver dams which are common throughout low order streams including those originating in peatlands. To understand the influence of beaver dams on hyporheic flows and biogeochemical properties, nitrogen (N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC) and N cycling rates were observed along a beaver dammed, third-order stream draining Canadian Rocky Mountain peatland. Beaver dams enlarged the hyporheric zone from 1.5 to 7.5m. The looping hyporheic flow path created a zone of N and DOC depletion adjacent to the dams. As a result, nitrification rates were lowest in this zone. Where hyporheic flows exited the riparian area and flowed back to the stream channel downstream of a dam, the adjacent riparian area served as a source of N and DOC to the stream. Enhanced nutrient influx to streams owing to beaver dam modified hyporheic flow paths has implications for stream biogeochemical cycling and ecological integrity, which need further exploration.

AB Despite near-extinction in the nineteenth century, after efficient restoration measures the population of Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber L.) in Latvia currently is viable and growing. While the ecological effect of the species on water quality and biodiversity is generally positive, the high number of animals in production forests often creates challenges for management. Drainage ditches are among the most favoured habitats of beavers resulting in flooded stands, reduced tree growth and economical losses. The aim of the study was to evaluate the chemical properties of water in forest drainage ditches, affected by beaver activity, and their changes after the dam removal. Chemical composition of surface water in ditches was analysed in sampling points above dam, below dam and in the ditch itself after removal of the dam; results compared to pristine beaver site nearby on a small stream. Results did not show significant differences between concentrations above and below dams. After removal of the dams, significant increase in DOC, N-NO3 (-), N-NH4 (+) and TSS concentrations and significant decrease in TP concentrations were observed in some of the sites. Observed concentrations of all measured parameters were significantly lower in pristine beaver site than in beaver sites on drainage ditches.

AB In a small, extensively artificially drained lowland catchment (15.5 km(2)) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (North-Eastern Germany), the dynamics and the extent of total phosphorus (TP) and total reactive phosphorus (TRP) losses as well as the discharge were monitored at different scales for three winter seasons of 6 months each. Ranging from 0.036 to 0.044 mg TP l(-1) and from 0.030 to 0.037 mg TRP l(-1), average phosphorus concentrations in the discharge of a collector drain, a ditch draining arable land and a small brook were low, Elevated concentrations occurred during intensive snowmelt events. Probably due to the re-mobilisation of phosphorus under anaerobic conditions, concentrations (0.137 mg TP l(-1) and 0.076 mg TRP l(-1)) in a ditch draining grassland on degraded peat were significantly higher than at the other sites characterised by mineral soils. Generally, phosphorus concentrations increased with discharge at all sites except for the grassland, although not during each single discharge event. Surprisingly, a dependency on the fertilisation practices could not be found. The phosphorus losses per winter season were low, with a maximum of 270 g TP ha(-1) and 211 g TRP ha(-1). Using a two-component mixing model based on baseflow separation and parameter optimisation, it was estimated that around 53,60 and 56% of the TP losses from the collector drain, from the ditch and from the brook as well as 53, 68 and 45% of the TRP loads were exported via a fast flow component. This component accounted for 18-23% of the total discharge. At all measurement stations, there were large differences between the partitioning patterns of the single discharge events. Our study has not only shown the event-based behaviour of the P losses and the possible occurrence of high P concentrations due to preferential flow, but also that the highest potential of eutrophication in this lowland landscape originates from drained, degraded, and intensively used peatlands.

AB Drainage of peatlands affects the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Organic soils used for agriculture contribute a large proportion of anthropogenic GHG emissions, and on-farm mitigation options are important. This field study investigated whether choice of a cropping system can be used to mitigate emissions of N2O and influence CH4 fluxes from cultivated organic and carbon-rich soils during the growing season. Ten different sites in southern Sweden representing peat soils, peaty marl and gyttja clay, with a range of different soil properties, were used for on-site measurements of N2O and CH4 fluxes. The fluxes during the growing season from soils under two different crops grown in the same field and same environmental conditions were monitored. Crop intensities varied from grasslands to intensive potato cultivation. The results showed no difference in median seasonal N2O emissions between the two crops compared. Median seasonal emissions ranged from 0 to 919 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1), with peaks on individual sampling occasions of up to 3317 mu g N(2)Om(-2) h(-1). Nitrous oxide emissions differed widely between sites, indicating that soil properties are a regulating factor. However, pH was the only soil factor that correlated with N2O emissions (negative exponential correlation). The type of crop grown on the soil did not influence CH4 fluxes. Median seasonal CH4 flux from the different sites ranged from uptake of 36 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) to release of 4.5 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1). From our results, it was concluded that farmers cannot mitigate N2O emissions during the growing season or influence CH4 fluxes by changing the cropping system in the field.

AB Recent studies have shown the establishment of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) to be successful in small canopy gaps cut in drained spruce mire stands in northern Finland. The aim of this study was to quantify seedling height growth in gaps and compare it to that observed in other canopy cuttings and plantations. We sampled spruce crop seedlings (maximum density ca. 3000 ha(-1)) in the spring of 2013 in a field experiment in which canopy gaps of 10, 15 and 20 m in diameter had been cut in winter 2004. The total seedling height in 2013 and the length of annual shoots over the past five years (2012-2008) were recorded in the survey. Seedling height varied from 20 cm to 2.7 m, with an average of 65 cm. The average annual height growth was 7.1 cm. A mixed linear model analysis was carried out to investigate seedling height growth variation. Seedling height was linearly and positively related to growth. Height growth started to increase in the fifth growing season after cutting. Seedling height growth in the 20 m gap was slightly better than in the smaller ones. In the 15 m gap, both the centrally located seedlings and those located at the northern edge grew best. In the 20 m gap, southerly located seedlings grew more slowly than seedlings in all other locations. The average seedling height growth in this study was about 60% of that in peatland plantations, but comparable to that in mineral soil gaps, and 2-3 times higher than in uneven-age cut stands.

AB Changes in climate and land use pressures in the boreal region may influence peatland stream sediment organic carbon (C) dynamics. Fifteen to 50% of stream sediment organic C resides in recalcitrant pools, with the lipids accounting for up to 25% of the peatland C pool. Nevertheless, lipid mineralization within peatlands and their draining stream sediments is poorly understood. Potential esterase activity, which is known to be an important enzyme group in recalcitrant C decomposition, is presented as an indicator of lipid hydrolysis in three streams surrounding an intermediate fen peatland. Organic C concentration ranged from 5 to 250 g C kg(-1) sediment during the sampling period, with the recalcitrant C pool accounting for 15 to 20%. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were typical of humic-like substances, such as aliphatic compounds (including lipids), phenolic and other aromatic structures, carboxyl groups, and polysaccharide structures. Esterase activity was positively correlated with organic C and total nitrogen (N) concentrations, and sediment pH. Esterase was most active in the presence of high organic C fractions and recalcitrant C, supporting the hypothesis that lipid hydrolysis in the peatland stream sediments may be an important and underestimated component of peatland C sequestration dynamics.

ID LAND-USE; SOIL SUBSTRATE; FEN SOILS; BALANCE; CYCLE
AB Peatlands are becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change because they store large amounts of carbon, but information regarding the exact amount of carbon is scarce. In their natural state (as mires), they sequester and store organic carbon (C-org), but they emit CO2 when drained. In calculating C-org storage, little attention has been paid to the fact that many peatlands have been intensively drained and used for more than 200 years, such that their soil characteristics have changed. Recent estimates of peatland carbon storage are based on simplified data for peat thickness, bulk density and C-org content. This paper offers an alternative method for estimating the amount of carbon stored which takes into account peatland type and secondary soil development. Peatlands that originated as different hydrogenetic mire types (HGMTs) store different amounts of carbon due to stratigraphical differences. It is estimated that 430 Mt of C-org is stored in peatlands belonging to the three dominant HGMTs in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (north-east Germany), and that percolation-mire peatlands store up to ten times more C-org than water-risemire peatlands. It is also demonstrated that gyttja soils make a significant contribution to C-org storage in terrestrialisation-mire peatlands; thus, after peats, these are the next most important soils for C-org stocks.

AB Trace metals were measured in situ in a freshwater river draining a peat catchment (DOC = 15 mg L-1) using diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) devices with a range of gel layer thicknesses (0.16-2.0 mm). The reciprocal of the accumulated mass of each metal varied linearly with the thickness of the diffusive layer. These plots allowed calculation of the thickness of an apparent diffusive boundary layer (ADBL). A constant value was obtained from the plots of Cd, Pb, and Zn. The observed increase in the ADBL for the other metals (Mn < Co < Ni < Cu < Al < Fe) was consistent with increasing kinetic limitation of metal supplied from complexes with humic substances. The results could be presented as a kinetic signature, which reflects the nature of the binding ligands available in the water. A theoretical basis for deriving kinetic constants from the DGT measurements was developed. The derived association rate constants for Ni, Mn, and Cu were consistent with values calculated by assuming that the Eigen mechanism holds and that the mean stability constants of the complexes are related to the binding constants of each metal with fulvic acid. These first in situ measurements of dissociation rate constants provided larger values than those obtained by different techniques in the laboratory, suggesting that trace metal complexes in natural waters may be more labile than previously thought.

AB Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas that is both produced and consumed in soils by microbially mediated processes sensitive to soil redox. We evaluated the classical conceptual model of peatland CH4 dynamics-in which the water table position determines the vertical distribution of methanogenesis and methanotrophy-versus an emerging model in which methanogenesis and methanotrophy can both occur throughout the soil profile due to spatially heterogeneous redox and anaerobic CH4 oxidation. We simultaneously measured gross CH4 production and oxidation in situ across a microtopographical gradient in a drained temperate peatland and ex situ along the soil profile, giving us novel insight into the component fluxes of landscape-level net CH4 fluxes. Net CH4 fluxes varied among landforms (p < 0.001), ranging from 180.3 +/- 81.2 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in drainage ditches to -0.7 +/- 1.2 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the highest landform. Contrary to prediction by the classical conceptual model, variability in methanogenesis alone drove the landscape-level net CH4 flux patterns. Consistent with the emerging model, freshly collected soils from above the water table produced CH4 within anaerobic microsites. Even in soil from beneath the water table, gross CH4 production was best predicted by the methanogenic fraction of carbon mineralization, an index of highly reducing microsites. We measured low rates of anaerobic CH4 oxidation, which may have been limited by relatively low in situ CH4 concentrations in the hummock/hollow soil profile. Our study revealed complex CH4 dynamics better represented by the emerging heterogeneous conceptual model than the classical model based on redox strata.

AB Study region: This study is based on the rapidly developing Athabasca Oil Sands region, northeastern Alberta.
   Study focus: Hydrograph separation using stable isotopes of water is applied to partition streamflow sources in the Athabasca River and its tributaries. Distinct isotopic labelling of snow, rain, groundwater and surface water are applied to estimate the contribution of these sources to streamflow from analysis of multi-year records of isotopes in streamflow.
   New hydrological insights for the region: The results provide new insight into runoff generation mechanisms operating in six tributaries and at four stations along the Athabasca River. Groundwater, found to be an important flow source at all stations, is the dominant component of the hydrograph in three tributaries (Steepbank R., Muskeg R., Firebag R.), accounting for 39-50% of annual streamflow. Surface water, mainly drainage from peatlands, is also found to be widely important, and dominant in three tributaries (Clearwater R., Mackay R., Ells R.), accounting for 45-81% of annual streamflow. Fairly limited contributions from direct precipitation illustrate that most snow and rain events result in indirect displacement of pre-event water by fill and spill mechanisms. Systematic shifts in regional groundwater to surface-water ratios are expected to be an important control on spatial and temporal distribution of water quality parameters and useful for evaluating the susceptibility of rivers to climate and development impacts.

AB Intensive agriculture in lowland river catchments is unthinkable without artificial drainage, but these drainage installations represent also an important pathway for diffuse nutrient inputs to surface waters.
   Efficient tackling of eutrophication requires distributed nutrient modelling with special emphasis on phosphorus inputs, because of their limitative role in freshwater ecosystems. General decision-making aims at the regional scale, but usually only little information exists about the location of drainage installations within meso- and macro-scale river basins. This lead to the development of an approach, how artificially drained lands can be identified by interpreting aerial photographs, and how these findings can be extrapolated by combining land use and soil information in GIS. The approach results in a map of artificially drained areas, which is presented here for the River Ems basin (12,940 km(2)), located in north-western Germany. This map provides the basis for distributed modelling of drainage runoff and diffuse phosphorus inputs. From the model results, it can be found, that about 69% of all P-inputs into surface waters are discharged via artificial drainages.
   Just under 30% of the diffuse P-inputs arise from less than 4% of the catchment area. These subareas consist of drained raised bogs used as grassland. Due to the favourable ratio of input level to area they are now at the focus of mitigation measures. With respect to the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive, the importance of model-supported analyses of nutrient inputs is increasing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB After rewetting of peatlands, phosphorus (P) pore-water concentrations were up to three orders of magnitude greater than under pristine conditions. It was hypothesized that different mobilization processes such as ion-exchange reactions, biotic/abiotic redox reactions, acidification and ongoing anaerobic decomposition of particulate organic matter by hydrolytic cleavage and fermentation might be responsible. To identify P pools in peat samples of varying degrees of decomposition, we modified and improved a sequential chemical extraction method that allowed conclusions on potential mobilization mechanisms in rewetted peatlands. The results indicated that the earlier drainage of rewetted fens strongly increased the P mobilization potential in the upper decomposed peat layers. Accordingly, the amount of P bound to redox-sensitive (bicarbonate/dithionite soluble) compounds (BD-P) was, on average, one order of magnitude greater in decomposed peat of rewetted fens (5.4-14.3 mu mol P g(-1) dry matter or DM) than in underlying less-decomposed peat layers (0.2-1.9 mu mol P g(-1) DM) or slightly decomposed peat derived from pristine fens (0.4-2.0 mu mol P g(-1) DM). The BD-P fraction found in the upper very decomposed peat layers appears to be most important for P mobilization in rewetted fens and accounted for 85% of the variability of P mobilization rates. Despite uncertainties regarding P diagenetic processes in peat, as well as the development of microbial decomposition processes, in the long-term, high pore-water P concentrations can be expected in rewetted fens for decades to come.

AB Organic peat soils have been extensively drained and used for agricultural, horticultural and energy purposes. The management practices of organic soils accelerate decomposition processes resulting generally in loss of carbon. Microbes are the key players in soil carbon cycling. We studied the effects of cultivation of a perennial bioenergy plant (reed canary grass, Phalanx arundinacea) on microbial biomass carbon, microbial respiration and microbial communities in an old, previously uncultivated peat soil. The cultivation increased the amount of microbial biomass carbon and microbial respiration in peat mostly in the uppermost 5 cm layer where the impacts of roots and litter are most pronounced. As shown by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, the abundance of fungi and gram-negative bacteria increased with cultivation, while the abundance of gram-positive bacteria decreased. The implications of these changes on carbon cycling and carbon storage in peat under reed canary grass are discussed.

AB Drained and cutover peatlands represent a persistent source of atmospheric CO2. Contemporary, intermediate, and long-term rates of peat oxidation were measured in an abandoned cutover peatland to estimate the mass of C lost in order to determined if the oxidation rate has changed with time since abandonment. Contemporary rates were measured six times per week at 25 locations within the peatland using a portable infrared gas analyzer and an enclosure system. Mean daily peat oxidation was 7.7 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) or 4.8 mm yr(-1). Intermediate (2-13 yr) oxidation rates were estimated using dendrochronological techniques. Over 325 birch (Betula spp.) shrubs, an invasive group of species in abandoned cutover peatlands, were removed from the peatland after measuring the distance to the existing peat surface from the collar of the trunk. Dating the birches permitted the determination of the rate of peat oxidation and erosion since the establishment of individuals. Long-term oxidation (19 yr) was estimated with over 10 000 measurements on exposed stable tree stumps. The mean intermediate and long-term oxidation rates were 6.2 +/- 2.9 mm yr(-1) and 5.7 +/- 1.1 mm yr(-1), respectively. These results suggest that peat oxidation rates remain high even after two decades of post-extraction abandonment. Since oxidation is an irreversible process, these results carry important implications for restoration work as well as for the determination of the long-term source of atmospheric CO2.

AB Quantifying changes in thermokarst lake extent is of importance for understanding the permafrost-related carbon budget, including the potential release of carbon via lake expansion or sequestration as peat in drained lake basins. We used high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery from 1950/51, 1978, and 2006/07 to quantify changes in thermokarst lakes for a 700 km(2) area on the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. The number of water bodies larger than 0.1 ha increased over the entire observation period (666 to 737 or +10.7%); however, total surface area decreased (5,066 ha to 4,312 ha or -14.9%). This pattern can largely be explained by the formation of remnant ponds following partial drainage of larger water bodies. Thus, analysis of large lakes (>40 ha) shows a decrease of 24% and 26% in number and area, respectively, differing from lake changes reported from other continuous permafrost regions. Thermokarst lake expansion rates did not change substantially between 1950/51 and 1978 (0.35 m/yr) and 1978 and 2006/07 (0.39 m/yr). However, most lakes that drained did expand as a result of surface permafrost degradation before lateral drainage. Drainage rates over the observation period were stable (2.2 to 2.3 per year). Thus, analysis of decadal-scale, high spatial resolution imagery has shown that lake drainage in this region is triggered by lateral breaching and not subterranean infiltration. Future research should be directed toward better understanding thermokarst lake dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolution as these systems have implications for landscape-scale hydrology and carbon budgets in thermokarst lake-rich regions in the circum-Arctic.

AB The most common forest management method in Fennoscandia is rotation forestry, including clear-cutting and forest regeneration. In clear-cutting, stem wood is removed and the logging residues are either removed or left on site. Clear-cutting changes the microclimate and vegetation structure at the site, both of which affect the site's carbon balance. Peat soils with poor aeration and high carbon densities are especially prone to such changes, and significant changes in greenhouse gas exchange can be expected. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy fluxes with the eddy covariance method for 2 years (April 2016-March 2018) after clear-cutting a drained peatland forest. We observed a significant rise (23 cm) in the water table level and a large CO2 source (first year: 3086 +/- 148 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1); second year: 2072 +/- 124 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). These large CO2 emissions resulted from the very low gross primary production (GPP) following the removal of photosynthesizing trees and the decline of ground vegetation, unable to compensate for the decomposition of logging residues and peat. During the second summer (June-August) after the clear-cutting, GPP had already increased by 96% and total ecosystem respiration decreased by 14% from the previous summer. The mean daytime ratio of sensible to latent heat flux decreased after harvesting from 2.6 in May 2016 to 1.0 in August 2016, and in 2017 it varied mostly within 0.6-1.0. In April-September, the mean daytime sensible heat flux was 33% lower and latent heat flux 40% higher in 2017, probably due to the recovery of ground vegetation that increased evapotranspiration and albedo of the site. In addition to CO2 and energy fluxes, we measured methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes with manual chambers. After the clear-cutting, the site turned from a small CH4 sink into a small source and from N2O neutral to a significant N2O source. Compared to the large CO2 emissions, the 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) of the CH4 emissions was negligible. Also, the GWP100 due to increased N2O emissions was less than 10% of that of the CO2 emission change.

AB Diatoms and other siliceous microfossils were examined from a 386-cm-long pear core, covering the last ca. 7200 yr, from north-central Siberia to gain insights into peatland developmental history, and to explore the potential of diatoms as proxy indicators in arctic pears. Diatom analyses of arctic peatlands are rare, and so one aspect of this study was to examine the sensitivity of diatom taxa in relation to independent paleoindicators already described from this core. Changes in the relative abundances of diatom taxa divided the core into four zones that closely tracked the ontogeny of the peatland from an open water environment (Zone I: benthic, alkaliphilic taxa), followed by fen environments (Zones EI and In; epiphytic, acidophilic taxa), and finally to a better-drained, high-centered bog (Zone IV; aerophilic taxa). In addition to the diatom tars, observations were made on the relative abundances of siliceous protozoan plates, chrysophyte cysts, and phytoliths. Both the diatoms and these other siliceous microfossils appeared to respond to changes in hydrology and moisture, as well as to fire episodes likely triggered by climatic change. This study demonstrates that diatoms and other siliceous microfossils from arctic peat deposits provide an important source of paleoenvironmental information that can strengthen interpretations derived from other commonly used indicators.

AB Tree growth was measured before, and 9 years after draining a boreal fen that supported a 50- to 60-year-old stand of tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.). Treatments consisted of a series of ditches spaced 30, 40 or 50 m apart, and an undrained control. Nine years after drainage, the diameter, height, basal area, and volume growth of tamarack had increased by 2-5 times that on the control site. Black spruce growth on the drained site was 1.6-5 times that on the control. Tamarack average volume growth (1.20 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) on the drained site was superior to that of black spruce (0.21 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)). In general for both species, there were no significant differences in growth between trees on the different ditch spacings. This result was attributed to the water table being low enough that adequate aeration zones existed across the strips between ditches on all spacings. Regeneration after treatment was greater on the drained than on the control plots, particularly in the disturbed areas near the ditches where new tamarack seedlings reached densities between 9400 and 12,000 stems ha(-1). There was no relationship between increased tree growth and tree distance from the ditches for both species, probably because the water table had been lowered sufficiently so that inadequate substrate aeration was no longer a limiting factor.

ID DECAY; DEGRADATION; CHEMISTRY
AB Heavily degraded waterlogged archaeological wood samples were tested for their ability to provide a substrate for aerobic wood degrading fungi. White- and brown-rot fungi were inoculated on sterilised 1600 year old ash wood previously degraded by erosion bacteria to determine their ability to degrade the wood further. It was found that only white rot was able to utilise the degraded wood tissue. Attack was observed on a macroscopic level as localised holes after 8 months of incubation and confirmed by light microscopy. In contrast to degradation on fresh ash, development of mycelia was significantly repressed. Increase in oxygen levels during draining of waterlogged soils or peat could lead to severe decay of archaeological wooden remains well before any detrimental changes due to desiccation.

AB Fertilization experiments were carried out at four stands of mire vegetation in the Biebrza valley, Poland. The stands included two rich fen communities, a moderate-rich/poor fen vegetation and a floodplain fen. In each stand five replicate sets of treatment plots (50 x 50 cm) were selected randomly. Each set consisted of five plots: a control plot, three plots which were fertilized with N, P, K, respectively and one plot with all three elements together. Fertilizer was applied in April. Groundwater and soil were sampled and analysed twice (April, July). In July aboveground biomass was harvested and nutrient concentrations in plant material were examined. Nutrient release from peat to pore water was measured by incubation experiments. Vascular plants were N-limited in the non-flooded fen communities. The vegetation in the floodplain was not limited by nutrients. The results compare well with the hypotheses of Wassen et al. (1995) on expected nutrient limitation of fens in the Biebrza valley, based on nutrient concentrations in (non-fertilized) mire vegetation. However, the critical nutrient concentration and the P/N-quotient in plant material should be regarded as rough indicators only. We expect N to be the controlling factor for the non-flooded fen communities as long as the fens are not drained and N-input by groundwater inflow and atmospheric deposition remains low.

AB Extensive drainage of UK lowland peat soils for agricultural production is considered a major contribution to the rate of degradation and the loss of peat resources. Microbial oxidation resulting from drainage accelerates decay rates of organic matter and the release of CO2 to the atmosphere and contributes to severe subsidence. We examined the effect of soil moisture, temperature and nutrient amendment on soil CO2 respiration rates from a low-lying peat grassland and a low-lying peatland under intensive arable farming in the UK. Soil samples were obtained from three different depths and equilibrated at a range of moisture contents under four prescribed soil water potentials (-0.1 to -10 m). The samples were incubated in the laboratory and the influence of temperature (10, 22 and 30 degrees C) and N addition (C/N ratio of 10:1, 5:1 and 2.5:1) on peat respiration was measured. In addition, field soil samples were analysed to determine the microbial community structure using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis technique. Respiration ranged from 0.8 to 15.0 mu g CO2-C g(-1) h(-1) at 10 degrees C and from 4.0 to 9.9 mu g CO2-C g(-1) h(-1) at 30 degrees C for different peats. Q(10) value between 22 and 30 degrees C ranged from 0.9 to 8.2. In contrast, Q(10) value between 10 and 22 degrees C varied from 0.2 to 2.2 suggesting, in some cases, an increase in respiration rate with decreasing temperature. Generally, temperature had a greater effect on the soils respiratory activity than the moisture content in drier pears, however soil moisture was determined to be the dominant parameter at higher moisture content. At high moisture content, the respiration rates at 10 degrees C exceeded those at 22 and 30 degrees C in four of the soils. Respiration varied with the degree of peat degradation and soil moisture content. Variations in soil moisture content did not always have a significant effect on CO2 emission in the humified surface pears but at higher soil moisture the CO2-C mineralisation rate of deeper, more fibrous peat horizons was higher at 10 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. Metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) ranged from 3.6 to 10.2 mg CO2-C h(-1) g biomass-C-1 in surface horizons and from 5.6 to 12.3 mg CO2-C h(-1) g biomass-C-1 in more fibrous pears, suggesting less available organic carbon at depth. N additions increased CO2-C mineralisation, with the maximum rate of respiration occurring at pressure potentials between -0.5 and -1 m. Peat samples at field moisture content were also analysed to determine phenotypic microbial community structure using PLFA analysis. This indicated that, microbial community structure varied between drained surface and saturated subsurface horizons. However, there was no difference in the microbial community structure between horizons when subjected to greater drainage. The effects of temperature and moisture on respiration found in deeper horizons and the phenotypic microbial community structure suggest that psychrophilic microbes predominate and that minimal drainage optimises their oxidation of peat.

AB The English polymath Lewis Fry Richardson (1881-1953) made important contributions to many fields, including numerical weather prediction, finite difference solutions of partial differential equations, turbulent flow and diffusion, fractals, and the cause and evolution of conflicts. His first papers in 1908 concerned unconfined flow of water in saturated soil, arising in the design of required ditch spacing for draining peat. He developed and used a graphical method to solve this problem. This and other practical problems stimulated his interest in numerical methods and soon led him to the challenge of numerical weather prediction. In 1922 he published the book Weather Prediction by Numerical Process. He did the research for this book under difficult circumstances just before, during, and right after World War I. The book was received positively, but methods like those proposed in it were not successfully implemented until the invention of fast digital computers around 1950. Posthumously, most of Richardson's contributions in various fields received considerable attention. Important exceptions are his contributions to soil science and hydrology, on which we focus in this paper. In his 1922 book, Richardson formulated an elaborate model for transport processes in the atmosphere. For the lower boundary of his atmospheric model, he needed to understand the movement of liquid water, water vapor, and heat in the upper layer of the soil, and at the soil-atmosphere and plant-atmosphere interfaces. Finding little previous work on this, he first of all formulated the partial differential equation for transient, vertical flow of liquid water in soil. We argue that the resulting equation can rightly be called the Richardson-Richards equation. In addition he formulated equations for simultaneous transfer of liquid water and water vapor, for transfer of heat in soil, and for the balances of water and energy at the soil-atmosphere and plant-atmosphere interfaces. Finite difference versions of all the equations were incorporated in the numerical weather forecasting model. Unfortunately, his results were hardly noticed by soil physicists and hydrologists, likely because they were too effectively buried in an intimidating book on weather prediction.

AB A combination of stable isotope studies and C-14 dating were used to identify the main sources and processes controlling streamwater DOC and TIC in a temperate non-forested watershed. delta C-13 values for terrestrial (-24.9 to -29.1 parts per thousand) and aquatic (-30.5 to -33.5 parts per thousand) plants were similar to values reported in the literature for similar ecosystems. delta C-13 values for DOC in soil solution and streamwater were consistent with soil and terrestrial vegetation, indicating that the terrestrial ecosystem is the dominant source of aquatic DOC in this watershed. delta C-13 values of soil atmosphere CO2 (-17.2 to -25.2 parts per thousand) were slightly less negative than would be expected for production via aerobic soil microbial decomposition and root respiration. There was a close correspondence between delta C-13 values (-15.5 to -21.5 parts per thousand) for streamwater TIC and soil atmospheric CO2 in the central part of the catchment where the stream drains CO2-rich peats. C-14 dating showed that although peat has been accumulating in the watershed for at least 2700 years, DOC in soil pore water and streamwater contains carbon of predominantly recent origin (post-AD 1955).

AB The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its light-absorbing fraction (chromophoric dissolved organic matter; CDOM) in surface waters, particularly those draining organic-rich peatlands, have dramatically increased over the past decade due to climate change and human disturbance. To explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of DOC and CDOM in surface waters of the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we collected water samples from two rivers in the Zoige alpine wetland and from two rivers in its adjacent alpine-gorge region, during wet and dry seasons. DOC concentration ranged from 4.82 mg center dot L(-1)to 47.83 mg center dot L-1, with a mean value of 15.04 mg center dot L-1, 2.84 times higher than the global average. The Zoige rivers had higher DOC concentration and highly terrigenous CDOM. Significantly higher DOC concentration was observed for the Zoige rivers in the wet season compared to the dry season. In contrast, the alpine-gorge rivers had higher DOC levels in the dry season. No significant correlations were observed between DOC and CDOM at all rivers due to the influence of autochthonous sources on the alpine-gorge rivers and intensive photochemical degradation of terrigenous DOM in the Zoige rivers. Significant relationships between CDOM and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) and between CDOM/DOC and SUVA(254)were observed, indicating that the aromaticity of DOM in the rivers was mainly determined by CDOM. Moreover, the DOC/CDOM properties of the Hei River indicate critical human-induced water quality degradation. High DOC level and high browning degree were found in rivers in the Zoige alpine wetland, indicating that large amounts of terrigenous DOC were released to the aquatic systems of the region.

AB Establishment of target species of the Cirsio tuberosi-Molinietum after topsoil removal in drained former riverbed sites of the Neckar (Hesse)
   We studied whether target species of the Cirsio tuberosi-Mohnietum can establish themselves after restoration measurements in former riverbed sites of the Neckar (administration district Darmstadt-Dieburg, Hesse). These wetland sites (partly former fens) had been drained with subsequent mineralization of peat. We ran topsoil removal experiments to decrease nutrient values in the topsoil layer and to detect the optimal hydrological conditions for Cirso-Molinietum species. As target area we used the nature protection area "Monchbruch" (south of Frankfurt / Main) with extensive stands, e.g., of the Cirsio-Molinietum.
   In this pilot study we analysed germination, establishment, and vitality of four target species (Carex tomentosa, Cirsium tuberosum, Galium wirtgenii and Linum catharticum) from 2006 to 2009. We ran a field experiment with a gradient of soil removal between 25 cm and 100 cm depth with addition of seeds of these target species. Besides these species, we analysed the floristic structure of the spontaneous vegetation and the establishment of a seed bank. Additionally, we used a second site to study topsoil removal of 10 cm.
   While target-species germination and establishment rates were both low at a soil removal depth of 10 cm, they were high at 25-40 cm depth. Carex tomentosa was not able to germinate and establish in the dryer parts of the gradient, whereas too-wet conditions with long, persistent watering were not tolerated by Galium wirtgenii and Linum catharticum. Cirsium tuberosum occupied an intermediate position. An optimal establishment rate and vitality of the four target species was attained between 25 and 40 cm soil removal depth. In the course of our four-year study we documented the spread of the target species as well as the beginning of the establishment of a seed bank.
   Meanwhile many of the former riverbed stands are grazed (partly in a mixed grazing-/ mowing system). Therefore, we asked if an establishment after endozoochorous dispersal by sheep is possible. In this second experiment, sheep were fed seeds of three target species (Carex tomentosa, Galium wirtgenii, Linum catharticum). Only Galium wirtgenii clearly germinated and established successfully. For Linum catharticum we were not able to exclude secondary inoculation. At least for Galium, sheep may play a role as vectors for diaspore transport between the areas. Further investigations will analyse the possible establishment of the Cirsio-Molinietum after inoculation with mown material of this community.

AB Spatial patterning of ecosystems can be explained by several mechanisms. One approach to disentangling the influence of these mechanisms is to study a patterned ecosystem along a gradient of environmental conditions. This study focused on hummock-hollow patterning of peatlands. Previous models predicted that patterning in drainage-dominated peatlands is driven by a peat-accumulation mechanism, reflected by higher nutrient availability in hollows relative to hummocks. Alternatively, patterning in evapotranspiration (ET)-dominated peatlands may be driven by a nutrient-accumulation mechanism, reflected by reversed nutrient distribution, namely, higher nutrient availability in hummocks relative to hollows. Here, we tested these predictions by comparing nutrient distributions among patterned peatlands in maritime (Scotland), humid temperate (Sweden), and humid continental (Siberia) climates. The areas comprise a climatic gradient from very wet and drainage-dominated (Scotland) to less wet and ET-dominated (Siberia) peatlands. Nutrient distribution was quantified as resource contrast, a measure for hummock-hollow difference in nutrient availability. We tested the hypothesis that the climatic gradient shows a trend in the resource contrast; from negative (highest nutrient availability in hollows) in Scotland to positive (highest nutrient availability in hummocks) in Siberia. The resource contrasts as measured in vegetation indeed showed a trend along the climatic gradient: contrasts were negative to slightly positive in Scotland, positive in Sweden, and strongly positive in Siberia. This finding corroborates the main prediction of previous models. Our results, however, also provided indications for further model development. The low concentrations of nutrients in the water suggest that existing models could be improved by considering both the dissolved and adsorbed phase and explicit inclusion of both nutrient-uptake and nutrient-storage processes. Our study suggests that future climate change may affect the ecosystem functioning of patterned peatlands by altering the contribution of pattern-forming mechanisms to redistribution of water and nutrients within these systems.

AB Since the early 1990s, restoration techniques have been developed for milled and cutover peatlands in eastern Canada. These techniques are based on the active reintroduction of peatland plant diaspores, blocking drainage, and the use of straw mulch to improve surface conditions. This study examines the effectiveness of using shallow (20 cm deep) basins of various widths to improve the success of current peatland restoration techniques. It comprises three different experiments, each spanning three or four growing seasons and combining both small-scale manual and large-scale mechanized plant reintroductions. Cover data recorded in two of the experiments were regressed against a series of environmental factors to determine how Sphagnum establishment success was related to abiotic variables such as moisture, water ponding, surface roughness, and mulch cover. Results of these experiments demonstrate that shallow basins were generally effective at promoting Sphagnum establishment and that this effect extends beyond the positive impact that basins have on hydrological conditions. Basins of various widths were equally successful. Soil-moisture content (linear positive effect) and duration and severity of flooding events (quadratic effect) were shown to be determinant of plant recovery. Other factors such as the density of straw cover (positive effect) and surface roughness (negative effect) were also instrumental in explaining local variation in Sphagnum cover. Plant cover after three and four growing seasons averaged 20-25% in mechanical reintroductions and 40-60% in manual reintroductions, demonstrating the overall effectiveness of the restoration techniques used.

AB This paper presents the results of multiproxy research (pollen, charcoal, plant macrofossil and testate amoebae) on the biogenic deposits core from Gorodetsky Moch, an ombrotrophic peatland in western Russia (Western Dvina Lakeland). We reconstructed the impact of disturbance on peatland development in the last 300 years by using chronology of the records based on(14)C and(210)Pb data set. The multiproxy reconstruction was compared with changes in the land cover using historical maps and Corona images, which provides a unique spatial analysis of past ecological and land-use changes. We aimed to determine the effect of local disturbances (drainage) and land-use changes (landscape openness) on the development of the peatland during the last 300 years. Our study suggests that human activity had a crucial impact on the development of the peatland in the last centuries. The analysis of testate amoebae and plant macrofossils revealed a clear disturbed layer in the second half of the 20th century CE. Most probably, the drainage of the peatland triggered changes in the community of testate amoebae and plants, thereby causing a functional shift inSphagnumpeatland ecosystem. The hydrological stress and vegetation composition shift led to the collapse of mixotrophic testate amoebae. However, the peatland showed strong resilience and recovered toward the end of the 20th century CE and the beginning of the 21st century CE, despite the lower water table. Our study shows an example of the peatland ecosystem that experienced a considerable stress but finally sustained the former function.

AB The effect of wood ash on growth of Scots pine was studied in 64- to 75-year-old stands on three upland sites (Exps. 402,407 and 408) for 20 years and in a 30-year-old Scots pine stand on an oligotrophic peatland site (Exp. 251) for 25 years. In Experiments 407 and 251 the responses of soil chemical properties and soil microbiological processes related to C and N cycling were also studied. The upland experiments included a control and a treatment with 3 Mg ha(-1) of wood ash. In Exp. 407, 120 kg N ha(-1) was applied together with ash; this experiment also included a treatment with N alone. The peatland experiment included a control and a treatment with 4.8 Mg ha(-1) of wood ash. All experiments had 3 replications. Wood ash significantly decreased soil acidity on all sites. On the upland site, after 20 years, the concentration of K2SO4-extractable DOC and the rates of C mineralization (CO2-C production) and net N mineralization were all higher in the Ash + N treatment than in the control or N treatments. However, the treatments did not significantly affect the amounts of C or N in the microbial biomass or the concentration of NH4-N. On the peatland site, after 27 years, ash stimulated C mineralization and cellulose decomposition, but microbial biomass C or N, net N mineralization or the concentration of N were not affected significantly. On both the upland and peatland site, net nitrification was very low in all treatments. In Exp. 408, the volume growth in the control and Ash treatment was during the 20-year study period 60 and 64 m(3) ha(-1), respectively, and in Exp. 402 108 and 120 m(3) ha(-1), respectively, the latter difference being significant. In Exp. 407, the volume growth in the Ash + N treatment was during the 20-year study period significantly higher (92 m(3) ha(-1)) than in the N and control treatments (76 and 73 m(3) ha(-1), respectively). On the peatland site during the 25-year study period the growth was 145 and 169 m(3) ha(-1), in the control and Ash treatments, respectively. In conclusion, the long-term positive response of stem growth to wood ash on peatlands and N fertilized upland sites can be partly explained by changes in soil nutrient status and by microbial processes related to C and N cycling.

AB Northern peatlands are forecast to experience changes in surface temperatures and precipitation patterns in the next century, with implications for their long-term water table position. Because peatlands are a large global C sink, it is important to investigate how multidecadal changes to hydrology will influence peat quality and C cycling. We examined peat substrate quality along a gradient of long-term water table alterations (reference, wet, and dry) across a peatland complex in northern Michigan with Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, aerobic and anaerobic incubations, and elemental analyses. Peat substrate quality was determined by the intrinsic differences between hummock and lawn peat, in addition to being affected by changes in hydrology. These factors altered decomposition processes and created differences in vegetation communities and structure across the long-term water table gradient. Our data suggest that peat from inundated sites is the most labile and that long-term drainage results in degraded peat quality. There may be interactive effects of climate change for increased trace gas production if wet sites drain, particularly if lawn microforms are dominant. Wet hummocky peatlands might be more resistant to increased trace gas production if the depth to water table changes with climate. These results indicate that peatlands impacted by long-term water table changes will experience shifts in substrate quality with concurrent changes in greenhouse gas emissions and highlight the need to incorporate microtopography in assessing the sensitivity of mineralization processes.

AB High Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions have been identified in hemiboreal forests in association with draining organic soils. However, the specific controlling factors that regulate the emissions remain unclear. To examine the importance of different factors affecting N2O emissions in a spruce forest on drained organic soil, a process-based model, CoupModel, was calibrated using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method. The calibration also aims to estimate parameter density distributions, the covariance matrix of estimated parameters and the correlation between parameters and variables information, useful when applying the model on other peat soil sites and for further model improvements. The calibrated model reproduced most of the high resolution data (total net radiation, soil temperature, groundwater level, net ecosystem exchange, etc.) very well, as well as cumulative measured N2O emissions (simulated 8.7 +/- 1.1 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1) (n =97); measured 8.7 +/- 2.7 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1) (n = 6)), but did not capture every measured peak. Parameter uncertainties were reduced after calibration, in which 16 out of 20 parameters changed from uniform distributions into normal distributions or log normal distributions. Four parameters describing bypass water flow, oxygen diffusion and soil freezing changed significantly after calibration. Inter-connections and correlations between many calibrated parameters and variables reflect the complex and interrelated nature of pedosphere, biosphere and atmosphere interactions. This also highlights the need to calibrate a number of parameters simultaneously. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that N2O emissions during growing seasons are controlled by competition between plants and microbes for nitrogen, while during the winter season snow melt periods are important. Our results also indicate that N2O is mainly produced in the capillary fringe close to the groundwater table by denitrification in the anaerobic zone. We conclude that, in afforested drained peatlands, the plants and groundwater level have important influences on soil N availability, ultimately controlling N2O emissions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Methane and carbon dioxide emissions from two Scottish peat soils and two Japanese paddy soils were compared. During aerobic incubation, CH4 uptake occurred with the peat soils showing a slightly higher activity than the paddy soils. Temperature exerted a marked effect on CO2 production but had a negligible effect on CH, uptake rate except at 30 degrees C where two soils showed a slight emission of CH4. At 10 and 20 degrees C, the mean first order uptake rate constant for all soils was 0.19 d(-1). With anaerobic incubation, CO2 production decreased while CH4 emission was promoted. The highest production (ng CH4-C g(-1) fresh wt. soil over 7 d) originated from the indigenous bog peat (4,500) while that from the other peat soil (10), from an area of drained and forested bog, was less than the production from either paddy soils (290 and 140). The proportion of carbon emitted as CH4 reached 11% for the bog pear, 1% for the paddy soils but only 0.02% for the forest peat. Though organic matter levels played some role in CH4 emission, the population level of methanogens determined by previous land use was thought to be the major factor controlling this process. Hence, greater differences, particularly for CH4 emission, were found between the two peat soils as a result of previous flooding history than was found between the peat and paddy soils.

AB There is interest in quantifying phosphorus (P) loss from intensively grazed dairy landscapes to identify key pathways and target remediation methods. The Bog Burn drains a dairying catchment in Southland, New Zealand, and has been monitored at fortnightly intervals over a 12-mo period at four sites for suspended sediment (SS), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and total phosphorus (TP). Time-integrated samplers, deployed at 0.6 median water depth at each site (calculated from previous year's flow data), collected sediment samples, which were analyzed for SS, bioavailable phosphorus (BAP), and TP. Mean concentrations of DRP and TP in stream flow and BAP and TP in sediment were generally highest in summer or autumn (0.043 mg DRP L-1, 0.160 mg TP L-1, 173 mg BAP kg(-1), 2228 mg TP kg(-1)) and lowest in winter or spring (0.012 mg DRP L-1, 0.034 mg TIP L-1, 6 mg BAP kg(-1), 711 mg TP kg(-1)), while loads were highest in winter. Analysis of Cs-137 concentrations in trapped sediment, topsoil, subsoil, and stream bed and bank sediment indicated that trapped sediment was derived from topsoil and entered the stream either through tile drainage or, to a lesser extent, overland flow. Because concentrations of DRP and TP in stream flow are in excess of recommended limits for good water quality (>0.01 mg DRIP L-1, 0.033 mg TP L-1), management should focus on the topsoil and specifically on decreasing P loss via tile drainage. This is best achieved by decreasing soil Olsen P concentrations, especially because, on average, Olsen P concentrations in the catchment were above the agronomic optimum.

TI Carbon budget response of an agriculturally used fen to different soil

SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
LA English

AB The agricultural use of peatlands usually requires drainage, thereby transforming these organic soils from a net carbon sink into a net source. The Seeland region of Switzerland is characterised by fens that have been intensively used for agriculture for 150 years. Our site is a degraded fen with a remaining peat layer of 60 cm that had been used as cropland until 2009. In connection to a nature protection project it has been managed as extensive permanent grassland since then. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was determined for two years (2015-2016). For this purpose, the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CH4 fluxes were measured by eddy covariance, and the carbon removed by harvest was quantified. Our degraded fen site was found to be a net carbon source of 477 +/- 73g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 434 +/- 51 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Annual CH4 emissions were marginal in both years with 0.4 +/- 0.8 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) (2015) and 0.7 +/- 0.7 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) (2016). In contrast to NECB, the NEE was considerably higher in 2015 than in 2016 (308 +/- 71 g C m(-2) yr(-1) vs 117 +/- 39 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The year 2015 was characterised by partial flooding of the grassland, followed by a dry and hot summer leading to lower CO2 uptake due to reduced growth, which was reflected in lower harvest compared to 2016. Thus, the short-term plant-induced carbon fluxes were altered, whereas total soil carbon loss remained rather constant. This was verified by an intra site comparison between the flooded and non-flooded part in 2015. Our results indicate that the soil carbon loss of this highly degraded peatland with a shallow peat layer is relatively moderate and hardly influenced by interannual weather variations.

AB We studied phosphorous (P) export after clear-felling from eight Scots pine dominated, hydrologically isolated catchment areas located on a low-P sorptive peatland site in southern Finland, using the paired-catchments approach. Four of the catchment areas were clear-felled traditionally with stem-only harvesting, two areas were clear-felled using whole-tree harvesting, and the remaining two areas were treated with both whole-tree harvesting and stump harvesting. The effect of clear-felling on P loads varied considerably between the catchment areas from no increase to an increase of over 1.5 kg ha(-1) of P during the three-year-study period. The most significant factor explaining the variation in P loads and the variation in P concentrations in outflow water from clear-felled peatland catchments was the post-harvest water level position. At water table levels <20 cm below ground level (bgl), the P release from peat was greatly increased, and no influence was observed on P release at levels greater than 30 cm bgl. The water table depth explained about 50% of the variation in harvest induced P export, while the harvest method and the peat P sorption characteristics were not significant in explaining harvest-induced P loads or P concentrations after harvesting. The results of our study suggest that management of harvest residues may not be an efficient means of managing P export in operational forestry. In addition, forest management practices that do not lead to a rising of water table level near the soil surface in the entire harvest area, such as strip cutting and small-scale clear-cutting or harvesting small canopy openings, should be studied in order to reduce P export.

AB Two well-preserved fungal remains (basidiomes of polypores Fomes fomentarius and Fomitopsis pinicola) were found in a fossil peatbog in Podleze, near Krakow (S Poland), in the context of culture layers dated to the Early Iron Age (mid-1st millennium BCE). Their context, age, and the cause of their occurrence in peat, which is exceptional, are discussed. Due to the location on the outskirts of an inhabited prehistoric settlement and because of the traces of detachment of the upper part in the Fomes fomentarius basidiocarp, we argue for their deposition in the peat layer via a human action. The host trees, however, could have grown in situ, since a drainage episode enabled the peatbog to be overgrown by sparse riparian forest at the onset of the Subatlantic. The possible use of the F. fomentarius fragment as tinder is discussed against the limited evidence of such use from later European prehistory.

AB Bogs can store large amounts of lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) from atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic emissions. Pb and As are exported along with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from these organic-rich systems, but it is not yet clear which hydrological (pre) conditions favor their export. This study combines a 1-year monitoring of precipitation, bog water level and pore water concentration changes with bog discharge and DOC, iron, As and Pb stream concentrations. From these data, annual DOC, As, and Pb exports were calculated. Concentrations ranged from 5 to 30 mg L-1 for DOC, 0.2 to 1.9 mu g L-1 for As, and 1.3 to 12 mu g L-1 for Pb, with highest concentrations in late summer. As and Pb concentrations significantly correlated with DOC concentrations. Fluxes depended strongly on discharge, as 40% of As and 43% of Pb were exported during 10% of the time with the highest discharge, pointing out the over-proportional contribution of short-time, high-discharge events to annual As, Pb and DOC export. Exponential increase in element export from the bog is explained by connection of additional DOC, As and Pb pools in the acrotelm during water table rise, which is most pronounced after drought. Pb, As and DOC concentrations in pore water provide evidence of an increase in the soluble Pb pool as soon as the peat layer becomes hydrologically connected, while DOC and As peak concentrations in runoff lag behind in comparison to Pb. Our data indicate a distinct bog-specific discharge threshold of 8 L s(-1), which is thought to depend mainly on the bogs size and drainage conditions. Above this threshold, element concentrations do not further increase and discharge becomes diluted. Combining pore water and discharge data shows that As and Pb exports are dependent on not only the amount of precipitation and discharge but also on the frequency and depth of water table fluctuations. Comparing the annual bog As and Pb export with element inventories indicates that As is much more mobilized than Pb, with annual fluxes accounting for 0.85 and 0.27% of total As and Pb inventory, respectively.

ID WOOD-ASH; GROWTH; TREE
AB The nutrients removed from the forest when branches and tree tops are harvested for fuel can be returned to the site by bringing back the wood-ash from the burning. In Sweden, this compensation measure is not carried out to any appreciable extent, mostly because there is no economic incentive to the landowner. The ash contains all the elements required for tree growth except for nitrogen (N), the most important element limiting growth on mineral soils. Since ash, so far, is brought back only to mineral soils, increased forest growth cannot be expected. In contrast, for organic soils, N is often abundant whereas the amounts of other mineral nutrients in peat are small. This means that the peatland forests provide an opportunity for ash amendment in order to increase forest production. Old fertilization trials using wood-ash show that the growth increase can be very large. The aims of this study were (i) to calculate the area of peat-covered land that, with respect to stand growth responses, could be regarded as most suitable for biofuel ash (wood-ash and peat-ash) fertilization and (ii) to assess the amount of biofuel ash needed for fertilizing this area.
   Most of the area calculations were based on data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (SNFI) 1997-2001. Sites were selected using existing knowledge about ash fertilization effects on tree growth and with the aid of registrations made in SNFI regarding peat thickness, site productivity, drainage, condition of drains, dominating field vegetation, and stage of stand development. Additional calculations were made to estimate the area of abandoned peat harvesting fields ready for after-use by afforestation.
   According to the selection criteria used, the most suitable sites for biofuel ash fertilization are drained, mid-rotation or old peatland forests where the field vegetation is dominated by shrubs or low sedge plants indicative of medium-low site productivity. The selected area comprises 190,000 ha. Most are located in North and North Central Sweden (90,000 ha), whereas South Central and South Sweden accounted for 30,000 and 70,000 ha, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). To these areas, 2000-3000 ha of abandoned peat fields ready for afforestation should be available within a period of about 5 years.
   The present annual production of biofuel ash in Sweden, of acceptable quality for forest fertilization, is 250,000300,000 tonnes. If it were desired to fertilize all the sites (190,000 ha) identified in this study with 5000 kg per ha, it would require 3-4 years of the current annual production of bio-ash. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The importance of characterizing the ecohydrological interactions in natural, damaged/drained, and restored bogs is underscored by the importance of peatlands to global climate change and the growing need for peatland restoration. An understudied aspect of peatland ecohydrology is how shallow lateral flow impacts local hydrological conditions and water balance, which are critical for peatland restoration success. A novel method is presented using microcosms installed in the field to understand the dynamics of shallow lateral flow. Analysis of the difference in water table fluctuation inside and outside the microcosm experimental areas allowed the water balance to be constrained and the calculation of lateral flow and evapotranspiration. As an initial demonstration of this method, a series of four microcosm experiments were set up in locations with differing ecological quality and land management histories, on a raised bog complex in the midlands of Ireland. The timing and magnitude of the lateral flow differed considerably between locations with differing ecological conditions, indicating that shallow lateral flow is an important determining factor in the ecohydrological trajectory of a recovering bog system. For locations whereSphagnumspp. moss layer was present, a slow continuous net lateral input of water from the upstream catchment area supported the water table during drought periods, which was not observed in locations lackingSphagnum. Consistent with other studies, evapotranspiration was greater in locations with aSpaghnummoss layer than in locations with a surface of peat soil.

AB The impacts of blanket peatland management on water tables, near-surface macropore flow and saturated hydraulic conductivity were investigated using automated dipwells and mini-disc tension infiltrometers. Three neighbouring hillslopes which were undisturbed, drained and restored by drain blocking were studied. Mean water table depths at the undisturbed sites were slightly shallower than at the restored site and water tables at both sites were significantly shallower relative to the drained treatment. Through time, however, the water table at the restored treatment behaved in a markedly different way to that at the undisturbed site. Water tables reached the peat surface for only 2% of the time for the drained and restored treatments compared to 18% for the undisturbed treatment. The proportion of runoff flowing through macropores in the near-surface layers of the peat was found to be large (>= 60%) across all three treatments, yet functional macroporosity was found to be significantly greater in the undisturbed peat relative to the two other treatments. Meanwhile, saturated hydraulic conductivity was found to be significantly higher at the restored treatment relative to the two other treatments, with mean conductivities ca. 1.5 times greater, suggesting a form of heightened soil-water interaction. Combined, the results indicate that although restoration by ditch blocking may result in a relatively successful water table recovery, there may not be the full reinstatement of peatland hydrological processes.

AB Acid organic soils drained for agriculture are hotspots for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Previous studies have indicated that water table (WT) depth and nitrogen (N) availability are important environmental controls, however, little is known about pathways leading to N2O emission. We investigated a raised bog drained for agriculture (pH 4.6 to 5.5) with, respectively, rotational grass and a potato crop in the experimental year and subplots with and without N fertilisation. The emissions and isotopic composition of N2O were monitored during spring and autumn periods with significant changes in WT depth, and in the availability of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). Nitrous oxide emissions were determined at 6-h intervals using eight automated chambers interfaced with a laser instrument for N2O isotopomer analysis. A threshold of 600 ppb N2O (final concentration) was adopted to stabilise estimates of site preference (SP) and delta N-15(bulk) of emitted N2O against the background of N2O in ambient air. Nitrous oxide emissions varied consistently with land use, slope position and time of day and year, but with little effect of N fertilisation. Isotopic signatures of N2O from the grassland site could not be investigated due to generally low emissions. In the potato field, in total 255 and 266 flux measurements exceeded the 600 ppb threshold in unfertilised and fertilised subplots, respectively. Both N2O emissions and isotopic signatures responded to WT dynamics, individual rain events, and soil N availability. Across eight individual periods, the delta N-15(bulk) of N2O emitted from the soil varied between - 55 and + 18 parts per thousand, while site preference (SP) varied between - 4 and + 25 parts per thousand. The first and the last period (shoulder seasons) were both N limited, and here isotopic signatures of N2O were similar and distinctly different from signatures in mid-season periods with mineral N accumulation. Nitrifier denitrification and chemodenitrification were proposed as potential pathways to N2O production in shoulder seasons, whereas in mid-season periods the isotopic signatures could be associated with either ammonia oxidation or fungal denitrication (late spring), or with bacterial denitrification (early autumn). The interpretation of isotopic signatures of N2O was confounded by the possible effect of N2O reduction. The study provides evidence that both sources and pathways of N2O emissions from managed organic soil vary dynamically with WT changes and N availability.

AB Recent studies have shown that, owing to a lack of seed trees, the natural rate of recovery of fire-disturbed bog forests previously dominated by the endemic and endangered conifer Pilgerodendron uviferum (D. Don) Florin is extremely slow. Hence, increasing the number of seed trees in the landscape through restoration planting could remove the principal biotic filter, limiting recovery of these forests. Here, we analyzed how the success of restoration plantings may be improved through the choice or manipulation of microsites in P. uviferum forests on Chiloe Island in North Patagonia. For this purpose, we manipulated microtopography in water-logged sites in bogs (mounds, flat terrain, mineral soil) and changed canopy conditions (gaps, semi-open, closed canopy) in upland sites with better drainage. In bogs, there was no significant effect of microtopography on growth and survival of P. uviferum plantings. However, fluorescence measurements indicated lower stress in seedlings established on mounds. Seedlings in upland areas established beneath a nurse canopy had lower mortality and higher relative shoot growth, foliar nutrients, photosynthetic light use efficiency and chlorophyll fluorescence values than those planted in the open. This indicates that seedlings of the slow growing P. uviferum can tolerate extremely wet conditions, yet suffer from stress when grown in the open. Here, the removal of canopy appeared to have also removed or reduced mycorrhizal networks for seedlings, leading to poorer nutrition and growth. Based on these results, recommendations for restoration plantings in highly degraded P. uviferum forests are presented.

AB Polyporous fungi, a morphologically delineated group of Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota), are considered well studied in Europe and used as model group in ecological studies and for conservation. Such broad interest, including widespread sampling and DNA based taxonomic revisions, is rapidly transforming our basic understanding of polypore diversity and natural history. We integrated over 40,000 historical and modern records of polypores in Estonia (hemiboreal Europe), revealing 227 species, and including Polyporus submelanopus and P. ulleungus as novelties for Europe. Taxonomic and conservation problems were distinguished for 13 unresolved subgroups. The estimated species pool exceeds 260 species in Estonia, including at least 20 likely undescribed species (here documented as distinct DNA lineages related to accepted species in, e.g., Ceriporia, Coltricia, Physisporinus, Sidera and Sistotrema). Four broad ecological patterns are described: (1) polypore assemblage organization in natural forests follows major soil and tree-composition gradients; (2) landscape-scale polypore diversity homogenizes due to draining of peatland forests and reduction of nemoral broad-leaved trees (wooded meadows and parks buffer the latter); (3) species having parasitic or brown-rot life-strategies are more substrate-specific; and (4) assemblage differences among woody substrates reveal habitat management priorities. Our update reveals extensive overlap of polypore biota throughout North Europe. We estimate that in Estonia, the biota experienced ca. 3-5% species turnover during the twentieth century, but exotic species remain rare and have not attained key functions in natural ecosystems. We encourage new regional syntheses on long studied fungal groups to obtain landscape-scale understanding of species pools, and for elaborating fungal indicators for biodiversity assessments.

DT Article

   aquatic habitat
ID GROWTH
AB Forest drainage is recognized as a means of improving soil conditions for tree growth, but it may also have environmental impacts. This article presents the 5-y time trend of soil and surface water quality observed in a drainage experiment conducted in a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) peatland of eastern Quebec, Canada, using the paired watershed approach. Nutrient content of peat soil water was enhanced by drainage. The effect was generally proportional to ditch closeness for S and Mg, while increases of N, Na, K and Ca were mainly observed within 5 m of the ditches, even though high levels of K and Ca were occasionally observed at 15-m distance. Drainage increased and sustained summer low flows by 25% through a 80 m(3) d(-1) increase of base flow on the 8 ha basin. The concentration of suspended sediments significantly increased and exceeded acceptable limits For aquatic organisms only during ditching and during the peak Rows of the following weeks. No effect on suspended sediments was detected during the spring following ditching but an increase was observed during a storm 2 y after ditching. Drainage modified the basin outflow temperature fluctuations by lowering the average weekly minimum and increasing the maximum, by 2 degrees C and 7 degrees C, respectively. Water temperature increases to 25 degrees C or more at the outlet of the drained basin were above the preferred range for brook trout. The treatment significantly increased specific conductivity of surface water, which was clearly related to increases in mineral N (NH4 + NOx), Ca, Mg, Na and S concentrations. However, conductivity and the increased nutrient concentrations remained within the acceptable criteria for aquatic organisms. Drainage also produced a pH increase of one unit, a result attributed to increased runoff from the upland part of the treated watershed. No effect related to drainage was found for Zn, Fe and Al contents. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important component of aquatic food webs. We compare the uptake kinetics for NH4-N and different fractions of DOM during soil and salmon leachate additions by evaluating the uptake of organic forms of carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), and proteinaceous DOM, as measured by parallel factor (PARAFAC) modeling of DOM fluorescence. Seasonal DOM slug additions were conducted in three headwater streams draining a bog, forested wetland, and upland forest using DOM collected by leaching watershed soils. We also used DOM collected from bog soil and salmon carcasses to perform additions in the upland forest stream. DOC uptake velocity ranged from 0.010 to 0.063 mm s(-1) and DON uptake velocity ranged from 0.015 to 0.086 mm s(-1), which provides evidence for the whole-stream uptake of allochthonous DOM. These findings imply that wetlands could potentially be an important source of DOM to support stream heterotrophic production. There was no significant difference in the uptake of DOC and DON across the soil leachate additions (P > 0.05), although differential uptake of DOM fractions was observed as protein-like fluorescence was removed from the water column more efficiently than bulk DOC and DON (P < 0.05). Moreover, PARAFAC analysis of DOM fluorescence showed that protein-like fluorescence decreased downstream during all DOM additions, whereas humic-like fluorescence did not change. This differential processing in added DOM suggests slow and fast turnover pools exist for aquatic DOM. Taken together, our findings argue that DON could potentially fill a larger role in satisfying biotic N demand in oligotrophic headwater streams than previously thought.

AB Peat lands are the most efficient carbon stores of all terrestrial ecosystems, containing approximately 455 Pg of carbon, which is twice the amount found in the world's forest biomass. The majority of this carbon is stored in the saturated peat soil. Pristine peatlands are still sequestering carbon at a rate of 0.096 Pg carbon per year; however, anthropogenic degradation of peatlands through draining, fires and exploitation can increase the production of GHGs, switching peatlands from net sinks to net sources of carbon. Conservation of peatlands throughout the UK and the rest of the world is clearly essential for limiting GHG emissions and it is therefore surprising that accounting for emissions from peatlands does not feature prominently in the UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol. Discussions at Conference of the Parties (COP) COP-15 and COP-16 look set to make amends for this oversight in any post-2012 climate change legislation, with peatlands becoming important factors in national GHG inventories, the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector, and in the creation of internationally accredited carbon credits. Using figures from The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), the world's peatlands can be valued at up to US$18 billion. However, this sum does not take into account pending UNFCCC decisions. The detailed mandatory inclusion of peatlands in national GHG inventory schemes and in accredited carbon markets could see their value rise even further. This review looks at the current GHG emission-monitoring legislation regarding peatlands, with special focus given to those in the UK. It discusses the importance of peatlands in carbon sequestration, reviews how peatlands feature in current GHG emission-monitoring schemes, concentrating on those associated with the Kyoto Protocol, and considers how peatlands may feature in national GHG emission-monitoring schemes and carbon markets in the future.

AB Eight mechanical cores, 50 auger holes, 145 borehole logs, and 19 radiocarbon ages are used to identify the sedimentary facies and patterns of mid-to late-Holocene development of the French North Sea coastal plain near the Belgian border. Stratigraphic sections show a shallow Pleistocene basement that deepens towards the North Sea, overlain by up to 11 m of deposits comprising basal peat representative of freshwater marsh development, covered inland by essentially muddy tidal sediments, and by sandy tidal deposits near the present North Sea. The peat is conspicuously absent in a well-defined circular depression, 'Les Moeres', lying astride the border. A widespread layer of sandy silt up to 3 m thick, absent in Les Moeres, and commonly overlying peat elsewhere, generally forms the topmost stratigraphic unit in inland areas, while near the North Sea, a well-defined inland aeolian sand unit, the Ghyvelde dune, overlies tidal flat sediments. The radiocarbon ages, ranging from 5651 cal. BP to 1070 cal. BP (c. 4908 +/- 52 yr BP to 1270 +/- 48 yr BP), date the final 2-3 m of infill. The very slow sedimentation corresponding to this upper part of the overall infill appears to reflect a lower sediment accommodation space and very slow regional sea-level rise. The superposition of a layer of sandy silt over peat over much of the inner part of the plain highlights a dramatic change, probably associated with the tidal prism and tidal channel dynamics, from widespread freshwater marshes to renewed tidal sedimentation, as new sediment accommodation space was created through peat drainage and compaction. Further seaward, dominantly sand-flat sedimentation persisted throughout the Holocene, such sand flats forming the foundation for the Ghyvelde aeolian dune. This dune probably accumulated largely after c. 3500 yr BP, following the welding onto this sand-flat shore of one or more large nearshore sand banks that are the primary source of dune accretion on this southern North Sea coast. In this area, the persistence of the tidal Les Moeres depression may reflect a propensity for weaker sand supply from the sea to a coastal embayment that was being increasingly sheltered by such dune development, accompanied by increasingly underfit tidal inlets. These inlets were finally sealed off completely by the accretion of the modern aeolian dune barrier which also led to the isolation inland, within the tidal plain, of the Ghyvelde dune.

AB Questions: What vegetational changes does a boreal rich fen (alkaline fen) undergo during a time period of 24 years after drainage? How is plant species richness affected, and what are the changes in composition of ecological groups of species? Is it possible to recover parts of the original flora by rewetting the rich fen? Which are the initial vegetation changes in the flora after rewetting? What are the major challenges for restoration of rich fen flora after rewetting?
   Location: Eastern central Sweden, southern boreal vegetational zone. Previously rich fen site, drained for forestry purposes during 1978-1979. The site was hydrologically restored (rewetted) in 2002.
   Method: Annual vegetation survey in permanent plots during a period of 28 years.
   Results: There were three successional stages in the vegetational changes. In the first stage there was a rapid (< 5 years) loss of rich fen bryophytes. The second step was an increase of sedges and early successional bryophytes, which was followed by an increase of a few emerging dominants, such as Molinia caerulea, Betula pubescens and Sphagnum spp. After rewetting, there are indications of vegetation recovery, albeit at slow rates. Depending on, for instance, initial species composition different routes of vegetation change were observed in the flora after drainage, although after 24 years, species composition became more homogenous and dominated by a few species with high cover.
   Conclusion: Major changes have occurred after changes in the hydrology (drainage and rewetting) with a severe impact on the biodiversity among vascular plants and bryophytes. Several rich fen bryophytes respond quickly to the changes in water level (in contrast to vascular plants). The recovery after rewetting towards the original rich fen vegetation is slow, as delayed by substrate degradation, dispersal limitation and presence of dominant species.

AB The diversity of ecosystems across boreal landscapes, successional changes after disturbance and complicated permafrost histories, present enormous challenges for assessing how vegetation, water and soil carbon may respond to climate change in boreal regions. To address this complexity, we used a chronosequence approach to assess changes in vegetation composition, water storage and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks along successional gradients within four landscapes: (1) rocky uplands on ice-poor hillside colluvium, (2) silty uplands on extremely ice-rich loess, (3) gravelly-sandy lowlands on ice-poor eolian sand and (4) peaty-silty lowlands on thick ice-rich peat deposits over reworked lowland loess. In rocky uplands, after fire permafrost thawed rapidly due to low ice contents, soils became well drained and SOC stocks decreased slightly. In silty uplands, after fire permafrost persisted, soils remained saturated and SOC decreased slightly. In gravelly-sandy lowlands where permafrost persisted in drier forest soils, loss of deeper permafrost around lakes has allowed recent widespread drainage of lakes that has exposed limnic material with high SOC to aerobic decomposition. In peaty-silty lowlands, 2-4 m of thaw settlement led to fragmented drainage patterns in isolated thermokarst bogs and flooding of soils, and surface soils accumulated new bog peat. We were not able to detect SOC changes in deeper soils, however, due to high variability. Complicated soil stratigraphy revealed that permafrost has repeatedly aggraded and degraded in all landscapes during the Holocene, although in silty uplands only the upper permafrost was affected. Overall, permafrost thaw has led to the reorganization of vegetation, water storage and flow paths, and patterns of SOC accumulation. However, changes have occurred over different timescales among landscapes: over decades in rocky uplands and gravelly-sandy lowlands in response to fire and lake drainage, over decades to centuries in peaty-silty lowlands with a legacy of complicated Holocene changes, and over centuries in silty uplands where ice-rich soil and ecological recovery protect permafrost.

AB Siberian mires, especially the world's largest coherent bogs of the Great Vasyugan Mire (Tomsk Region, West Siberian Plain, Russia), play an important role in the regional hydrological cycle, global carbon balance and influence flow formation of the region's rivers. We revealed the role of natural mires in supplying water to a mire-dominated (80% of the river basin area) Siberian catchment of the Klyuch River that represents typical features of the headwater catchment of the Great Vasyugan Mire, the world's largest mire in natural and well-preserved conditions. Our research protocol involved an analysis of the electric conductivity of peat water along selected transects of the mire, analysis of groundwater levels and river discharge and electric conductivity of the river water. We used ground-penetrating radar to determine the structure of the peat. We revealed that the examined part of the mire depends solely on the rainwater supply and that minerotrophic groundwater is not present within the area of the research. Average groundwater levels within the mire in the period 2013-2018 reached 0.193 m b.g.l. We also revealed that the natural drainage of mire water does not sustain river discharge throughout the whole year. This means the Klyuch remains an intermittent river dependent on the natural outflow of the mire's waters, after exceeding the mire's critical water retention volume. Total retention volume of a mire depends on the peat's physical features and the mire's short-term response to excessive thaw and precipitation events. An analysis of river discharge duration curves demonstrated that river discharge can be sustained by the duration reaching from 0.39 up to 0.71 in a year, in dry and wet years, respectively. We concluded that in a specific hydrogeological setup of the mire-river system, natural ombrotrophic mires cannot be considered as systems with a continuous water supply and discharge stabilization. We concluded that the Hortonian vision of infiltration and discharge is not valid in bog dominated basins. In the face of climatic changes in Siberia, we foresee a decrease in the discharge volume from the headwaters of rivers and the increase of river intermittence which may affect total outflow volume, specifically in the upper Ob and Irtysh, by reducing the contribution of surface runoff.

AB Long-term increases in DOC concentration in rivers draining areas of upland peat are a ubiquitous phenomenon in the UK. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these increases, but one compelling explanation is the observed long-term increase in temperature in UK uplands causing increases in peat decomposition rates, and increasing the depth of oxidation as evaporation increases depth to the water table. The study constructed an empirical model for water table depth and decomposition rate calibrated against observations from the Environmental Change Network monitoring site at Moor House in the North Pennines, UK. The study shows: (i) Depth of the water table has not changed significantly over a 30-year period, reflecting the fact that blanket peat is well buffered against climate change. (ii) Increases in temperature are responsible for a 12% increase in DOC production while an approximate 78% increase in DOC production has been observed. (iii) Overall DOC production is predicted to rise by 6% but observation suggests increases on the scale of 97%. (iv) The model inadequately represents changes in production and supply of DOC during periods of severe drought. The study shows that temperature change alone is insufficient to explain observed increases in DOC production. Alternative explanations for large increases in DOC production could include changes in land management, but an enzymic latch mechanism, i.e. derepression of anaerobic degradation, causing increased decomposition rates in response to severe drought is preferred.

AB We assessed whether peat mining intensity influences the use of bog ponds by green frogs (Rana clamitans). We selected 21 ponds in three areas undergoing different levels of peat mining: 1) mined (vegetation completely removed exposing bare peat, presence of drainage ditches with little or no water), 2) in preparation to be mined (vegetation intact but presence of drainage ditches filled with water), and 3) natural (vegetation intact, absence of drainage ditches). We estimated green frog abundance and reproduction using a combination of sampling techniques. Green frogs were detected more often at ponds in the moderately disturbed section than at ponds in either the mined bog or natural sections. Furthermore, no green frogs called at ponds on mined surfaces, as opposed to ponds on either natural or moderately disturbed surfaces. Tadpoles occurred only in the moderately disturbed section. This suggests that ponds on mined surfaces provide suboptimal habitat for green frogs. Within the moderately disturbed section, drainage ditches may provide additional breeding habitat and facilitate movements between ponds. However, if this positive effect occurs, it is only temporary because moderately disturbed sections are inevitably mined. Although preserving vegetated corridors or buffer zones around bog ponds within mined surfaces may not necessarily increase pond use by amphibians in the short term, it will facilitate the restoration phase of mined sites by providing a source of dispersers of bog plants and wildlife, including amphibians.

AB Questions: Does restoration management of a formerly afforested blanket bog lead to the vegetation, and the environmental conditions it indicates, becoming similar to intact bog?
   Location: A 147-ha blanket bog in Scotland's Flow Country, afforested in the 1980s but undergoing restoration since 1998.
   Methods: Vegetation in the restoration area was surveyed in nine, 1.6-6.4-ha plots, in 1998, 2003 and 2011. Each plot was matched to nearby plots that were either intact bog or remained afforested. Principal Response Curves were used to highlight the main axes of vegetation variation and test whether plant community trajectories in the restoration area differed from intact bog. The following restoration outcomes were assessed: floristic similarity to bog vegetation; and moisture, fertility and acidity, as inferred from vegetation using Ellenberg indicator values.
   Results: In the 6 years after restoration began, vegetation developed towards bog-like conditions. In the subsequent 8 years, overall vegetation change stalled, and spatial variability increased, reflecting diverging trajectories in wetter and drier parts of the site. Ellenberg's F-values implied significant re-wetting in the restoration area, reaching moisture levels similar to intact bog. Other restoration outcomes progressed in wetter microsites and areas (furrows and flat ground), but stalled in drier locations (plough-ridges and steeper slopes).
   Conclusions: Overall moisture conditions, as indicated by plants, have recovered. However, restoration progress has stalled in drier areas, where additional management may be needed. Long-term vegetation monitoring has helped clarify barriers to recovery and the management needed to overcome them. The value of such monitoring schemes in guiding restoration should be reflected in their wider implementation, within an adaptive management framework.

AB Northern peatlands play an important role in the regulation of the atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, functioning as a net carbon sink with low rates of organic decomposition. However, perturbations such as drainage increase peat oxidation, which may lead to enhanced gaseous release of carbon. For this reason, the number of restoration projects that aim to rewet blanket bogs has increased in the last few years, but there is still a lack of understanding of the impact of restoration on emissions of greenhouse gases, such as methane, particularly in sites restored from forestry. In this paper, we investigate the seasonal greenhouse gas dynamics in a forest-to-bog restoration site in Scotland. We analyse the effects of restoration on both carbon dioxide and methane fluxes, and investigate which site factors (microtopography, vegetation type, soil moisture and temperature) drive the processes of gaseous exchange between the bog surface and the atmosphere. Our results show that the original surface is near greenhouse gase equilibrium at -0.28 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1) and that microtopographic features act as a net greenhouse gas sink (ridges = -0.94 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1) and furrows = -0.86 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1)), whereas the bog pool is a net source of greenhouse gases (0.98 gCO(2)eq m(2)center dot day(-1)). We found different vegetation species play a key role in greenhouse gas flux dynamics, especially in forestry-derived microtopographical features, and their presence and influence on greenhouse gas dynamics should be accounted for to provide a more comprehensive understanding of emissions associated with restoration management practices.
   Highlights
   GHG (CO2 and CH4) dynamics in a boreal peatland restored from forestry are mainly affected by microtopography and vegetation.
   Forestry-derived microforms (ridges and furrows) are better GHG sinks than pools (GHG emitters) and original surfaces (near GHG equilibrium).
   The presence of Trichophorum cespitosum leads to higher CH4 emissions.
   Restoration practices like terraforming may create a short-term pulse net GHG emission due to an increase of both CH4 and CO2 fluxes.

AB This study used a two-dimensional steady-state finite-element groundwater flow model to simulate groundwater flow in two Newfoundland blanket peat complexes and to examine flow system sensitivity to changes in water table recharge and aquifer properties. The modelling results were examined within the context of peat-forming processes in the two complexes. Modelled flow compared favourably with observed flow. The sensitivity analyses suggested that more highly decomposed bog peat along bog margins probably has/had a positive impact on net peat accumulation within bog interiors. Peat with lower hydraulic conductivity along bog margins effectively impedes lateral drainage, localizes water table drawdown to extreme bog margins, and elevates water tables along bog interiors. Peat formation and elevated water tables in adjacent poor fens/laggs currently rely on placic and ortstein horizons impeding vertical drainage and water flow inputs from adjacent bogs. Modest reductions in atmospheric recharge were found to govern bog-flow-system geometries in a way that would adversely affect paludification processes in adjacent fens/laggs.

AB Drained organic soils are considered to be hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Arable lands and intensively used grasslands, in particular, have been regarded as the main producers of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, GHG balances of former peatlands and associated organic soils not considered to be peatland according to the definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have not been investigated so far. Therefore, our study addressed the question to what extent the soil organic carbon (SOC) content affects the GHG release of drained organic soils under two different landuse types (arable land and intensively used grassland). Both land-use types were established on a Mollic Gleysol (labeled C-medium) as well as on a Sapric Histosol (labeled C-high). The two soil types differed significantly in their SOC contents in the topsoil (C-medium: 9.4-10.9% SOC; Chigh: 16.117.2% SOC). We determined GHG fluxes over a period of 1 or 2 years in case of N2O or methane (CH4) and CO2, respectively. The daily and annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was determined by measuring NEE and the ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) with the closed dynamic chamber technique and by modeling the R-ECO and the gross primary production (GPP). N2O and CH4 were measured with the static closed chamber technique. Estimated NEE of CO2 differed significantly between the two land-use types, with lower NEE values (6 to 1707 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1)) at the arable sites and higher values (1354 to 1823 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)) at the grassland sites. No effect on NEE was found regarding the SOC content. Significantly higher annual N2O exchange rates were observed at the arable sites (0.23-0.86 g Nm(-2) yr(-1)) than at the grassland sites (0.12-0.31 g Nm(-2) yr(-1)). Furthermore, N2O fluxes from the Chigh sites significantly exceeded those of the C-medium sites. CH4 fluxes were found to be close to zero at all plots. Estimated global warming potential, calculated for a time horizon of 100 years (GWP(100)) revealed a very high release of GHGs from all plots ranging from 1837 to 7095 g CO2 (eq). m(-2) yr(-1). Calculated global warming potential (GWP) values did not differ between soil types and partly exceeded the IPCC default emission factors of the Tier 1 approach by far. However, despite being subject to high uncertainties, the results clearly highlight the importance of adjusting the IPCC guidelines for organic soils not falling under the definition in order to avoid a significant underestimation of GHG emissions in the corresponding sectors of the national climate reporting. Furthermore, the present results revealed that mainly the type of land-use, including the management type, and not the SOC content is responsible for the height of GHG exchange from intensive farming on drained organic soils.

AB The South Pennines, an area of acid-sensitive geology at the centre of a major industrial region, have undergone perhaps the most severe historic exposure to sulphur and nitrogen deposition in the UK. This study addresses a lack of existing research on the region by presenting the findings of a survey of 62 surface waters sampled during a I-week period in April 1998. Results indicate that acidification in the region is acute; 27 of the sampled surface waters had a negative acid neutralising capacity (ANC) and 28 had a pH below 5.0. Minimum recorded pH values were below 4.0. Non-marine sulphate levels were extremely high (median 222 mu eq/l), and widespread high nitrate concentrations (median 41 mu eq/l) suggest that soils in the region as a whole may be at an advanced stage of nitrogen saturation. A consistent relationship was identified between site acidity and the balance between the major weathering-derived cations, calcium and magnesium, and sulphate. This could in turn be linked to catchment soil type and land use, with the most acidic conditions occurring in peat-dominated catchments, where weathering is minimal and the influence of atmospheric deposition most pronounced. Percentage of peat in each catchment was the single best predictor of surface water acidity. Nitrate concentrations, although not a dominant control on acidity, varied significantly according to land use. Elevated concentrations were observed in catchments containing forestry, due to enhanced deposition inputs, and in catchments containing improved land, linked to fertiliser use. Ammonium concentrations, although low at most catchments, were a significant component of the inorganic nitrogen total in a number of surface waters draining waterlogged peat catchments.

AB The alpine wetlands of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) contribute 30%-40% of China's natural wetlands, and they are experiencing changes in climate, i.e. warming of 0.26 degrees C 10 yr(-1) (since the 1950s), as well as considerable human impacts. Consequently, alpine wetland extent show strong response to these impacts in most part, a reduction since the 1970s, followed by a recovery since the 2000s. In the eastern TP, they suffered stronger human regulations in Zoige mires, i.e. decades' drainage and recent restoration. These alpine wetlands have long been considered as a vital CH4 source, while inventories and model simulations estimated these wetlands emit roughly 1 Tg CH4-C yr(-1) and predicted an increase due to increased temperature and recovery of wetland extent. The alpine wetlands are generally a CO2 sink of roughly 15.8 Tg CO2 yr(-1), mitigating half of their emitted CH4, and satellite-based observations of vegetation greening have observed that their plants took more CO2 from the atmosphere. Furthermore, the alpine wetlands provide a biophysical cooling effect, due to higher evaporative energy loss during early growing seasons. Variations in both climate changes and human influences have been well documented and indicate that these alpine wetlands provide vital feedbacks to the climate.

AB The need of the best utilization of water resources of catchments in Lubelszczyzna, results from the fact that region the water scarce areas of Poland. In addition this deficit is gradually deepening, when the annual sum of precipitation does not excess 550 mm. Improvement of water reserves in habitats is one of aims of so-called small retention.
   The object of study is to analyze the size of the components of the water balance in dreinage river valleys micro-catchments of peatland. The study used the results of research and field observations from the years 2010 - 14. Catchment ditch K-2 is located in the Sosnowica - Piwonia river basin. The catchment area of the ditch is 0.46 km2 and is 86% as a one-crop seminatural meadows land use. The soil cover is dominated by degraded soil muck-peat (MtIIbb). In the catchment area 75% of the habitat moorshed and moist with a high groundwater level.
   Carried out investigations indicate significant impact of meteorological conditions as well as habitats on runoff index and retention changes in analyzed hydrological years. The highest rates occurred in the summer half of the outflow year 2009/10, and have been associated with heavy rainfall in May and in August and September. They amounted to 90 mm and were almost three times higher than in an average year, similar to 2011/12. Water flow is composed equally of surface runoff and underground outflow. This balance is particularly true with regard to the flatness of the terrain and reduced absorbency of hindering drainage. Especially during the spring thaw the soil can not accumulate large amounts of water. Retention observed changes were low, because of the high capillary rise of organic soils. The observed mediocre in the year negative value retention demonstrates the need for irrigation of the land.
   Studies have confirmed the dominant role of surface evaporation in the water balance. This is evidenced by the lower outflows in the first half year compared to the first half of the winter and fall in the average retention. High evaporation mainly favors the occurrence of shallow water and the air temperature. Potential evapotranspiration of grassland areas sufficiently moisture exceed 500 mm.
   The resulting work results differ from the calculation for the Leczna-Wlodawa Lakeland. Indicator values for the period 1951-1995 are: rainfall 550 mm, 108 mm outflow, evaporation 442 mm, changing retention assumed 0 mm. While the similar results were achieved with research conducted in the catchment ditch the G-8, where in a normal water outflow amounted to 102 mm, and retention decreased by 33 mm.

AB In addition to the customary drivers of cost and timely project delivery, embodied energy (EE) and embodied carbon (EC) have come to prominence in recent years as major design considerations in all aspects of large-scale road construction projects. An assessment of road construction necessitating the excavation or alteration of peat should consider the impact on carbon stored within the peat and the greenhouse gases potentially released. A methodology for calculating the environmental impact of constructing roads on peat is presented in this paper. Furthermore, the paper describes the application of this methodology (focusing on EE and EC calculations) to a case study; a section of the M6 motorway in Ireland for which excavate-and-replace was the ground improvement method (Scenario ER). A range of peat-related factors impacting on EE and EC estimates were examined, including materials, transport and machinery, as well as more unfamiliar factors such as peat drainage, drainage systems, restoration, slope stability and clearance of vegetation/forest. Comparisons of total EC are investigated under various management practices and restoration techniques for peatlands, assessing their strength in terms of hydrology and carbon storage potential. The total EC and EE for road construction to the sub-base level (and implications thereof) of the 2.14 km section of the M6 discussed in this paper was 17,220 tCO(2)eq (8047 tCO(2)eq/km) and 54,541 GJ (25,487 Gl/km), respectively, with carbon loss from excavated peat accounting for 62% of the total EC. Two other ground improvement method scenarios for constructing this section of road were also considered: Scenario S, soil-mixing and Scenario ER + P, an appropriate combination of excavate-and-replace and piling. Scenario S gave rise to a total EC of 25,306 tCO(2)eq (11,825 tCO(2)eq/km) and a total EE of 164,364 GJ (76,806 GJ/km) while Scenario ER + P gave rise to a total EC of 17,048 tCO(2)eq (7966 tCO(2)eq/km) and a total EE of 92,706 GJ (43,320 GJ/km). In this study, Scenario ER was the preferred technique as it had EC comparable to Scenario ER + P and the lowest EE. On the other hand, Scenario S was the least favourable due to the high EC and EE of the binder. However, this paper shows that the EC and EE can be decreased dramatically by changing the binder proportions. Furthermore, the EC of Scenarios ER and ER + P can also be significantly reduced if alternative restoration techniques are employed for excavated peat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A large share of peatlands in northwestern Germany is drained for agricultural purposes, thereby emitting high amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In order to quantify the climatic impact of fen soils in dairy farming systems of northern Germany, GHG exchange and forage yield were determined on four experimental sites which differed in terms of management and drainage intensity: (a) rewetted and unutilized grassland (UG), (b) intensive and wet grassland (GW), (c) intensive and moist grassland (GM) and (d) arable forage cropping (AR). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and fluxes of CH4 and N2O were measured using closed manual chambers. CH4 fluxes were significantly affected by groundwater level (GWL) and soil temperature, whereas N2O fluxes showed a significant relation to the amount of nitrate in top soil. Annual balances of all three gases, as well as the global warming potential (GWP), were significantly correlated to mean annual GWL. A 2-year mean GWP, combined from CO2-C eq. of NEE, CH4 and N2O emissions, as well as C input (slurry) and C output (harvest), was 3.8, 11.7, 17.7 and 17.3MgCO(2)-C eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for sites UG, GW, GM and AR, respectively (standard error (SE) 2.8, 1.2, 1.8, 2.6). Yield-related emissions for the three agricultural sites were 201, 248 and 269 kgCO(2)-C eq. (GJ net energy lactation; NEL) 1 for sites GW, GM and AR, respectively (SE 17, 9, 19). The carbon footprint of agricultural commodities grown on fen soils depended on longterm drainage intensity rather than type of management, but management and climate strongly influenced interannual onsite variability. However, arable forage production revealed a high uncertainty of yield and therefore was an unsuitable land use option. Lowest yield-related GHG emissions were achieved by a three-cut system of productive grassland swards in combination with a high GWL (long-term mean <= 20 cm below the surface).

AB Even though large extents of boreal peatlands are still in a pristine condition, especially in North America, extensive areas have been affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances that change some of the systems from being sinks to sources of carbon dioxide and shift the methane production/consumption patterns through alterations of both above- and below-ground communities and functions. In order to fully assess the role of peatlands on global C balance, now and in the future, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of the relative contributions of various groups of microorganisms to organic matter transformations. Here, we review the drivers structuring fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in natural peatlands and the response of these microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, drainage, nutrient deposition, peat mining and climate change. The microbial diversity in peatlands is characterized by organisms that have developed physiological and metabolic adaptations to cope with the constraining conditions found in these ecosystems, such as low oxygen availability, cold temperature, acidity and oligotrophy. Furthermore, these unique organisms sometimes appear to be organized as repeat mosaics responding to vegetation, physicochemical and hydrological characteristics more than to geographical distance, in other words, similar to the much valued biodiversity aspects of the peatland vegetation itself and associated higher organisms. The response of microbial communities to disturbances is far from fully understood. In particular, whilst many studies have identified changes in microbial community composition or on microbially driven processes following a given disturbance, it remains unclear how the two components, diversity and function, relate with each other. Future challenges involve designing studies that will test whether ecological theories like species sorting, stress physiology, temporal niche or functional redundancy can be used to understand what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatlands, and studies that will allow us to predict more accurately how peatlands respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB The protection of ecological functions of forested swamps and peatlands is the subject of legal and regulatory measures. In Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, wood harvesting is carried out on swamps and peatlands of merchantable forests. What is the impact of forestry practices on these wetlands hydrological functions such as sediment retention, groundwater recharge, flood reduction and low flow augmentation? The answer to this question is complex as the contribution of wetlands to these hydrological functions vary with each wetland type as underlined by the experts. With the aim of ascertaining the contribution of wetlands, and to infer the effects of forest management on forested swamps and peatlands, we carried out a literature review. The existing literature reviews only partially cover the subject or in the case of peatlands, they mainly consider drained sites. In this review, the links between the hydrologic functions and forest harvesting are treated by category of wetlands to take into account their anticipated specific contribution.

TI Greenhouse gas exchange of rewetted bog peat extraction sites and a

AB During the last decades an increasing area of drained peatlands has been rewetted. Especially in Germany, rewetting is the principal treatment on cutover sites when peat extraction is finished. The objectives are bog restoration and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The first sites were rewetted in the 1980s. Thus, there is a good opportunity to study long-term effects of rewetting on greenhouse gas exchange, which has not been done so far on temperate cutover peatlands. Moreover, Sphagnum cultivating may become a new way to use cutover peatlands and agriculturally used peatlands as it permits the economical use of bogs under wet conditions. The climate impact of such measures has not been studied yet.
   We conducted a field study on the exchange of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide at three rewetted sites with a gradient from dry to wet conditions and at a Sphagnum cultivation site in NW Germany over the course of more than 2 years. Gas fluxes were measured using transparent and opaque closed chambers. The ecosystem respiration (CO2) and the net ecosystem exchange (CO2) were modelled at a high temporal resolution. Measured and modelled values fit very well together. Annually cumulated gas flux rates, net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) and global warming potential (GWP) balances were determined. The annual net ecosystem exchange (CO2) varied strongly at the rewetted sites (from -201.7 +/- 126.8 to 29.7 +/- 112.7 gCO(2)-C m(-2) a(-1)) due to differing weather conditions, water levels and vegetation. The Sphagnum cultivation site was a sink of CO2 (-118.8 +/- 48.1 and -78.6 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2) a(-1)). The annual CH4 balances ranged between 16.2 +/- 2.2 and 24.2 +/- 5.0 gCH(4)-C-2 a(-1) at two inundated sites, while one rewetted site with a comparatively low water level and the Sphagnum farming site show CH4 fluxes close to 0. The net N2O fluxes were low and not significantly different between the four sites.
   The annual NECB was between -185.5 +/- 126.9 and 49.9 +/- 112.8 gCO(2)-Cm(-2)a(-1) at the rewetted sites and -115.8 +/- 48.1 and -77 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1) at the Sphagnum cultivating site. The annual GWP100 balances ranged from -280.5 +/- 465.2 to 644.5 +/- 413.6 gCO(2)-eq.m(-2) a(-1) at the rewetted sites. In contrast, the Sphagnum farming site had a cooling impact on the climate in both years (-356.8 +/- 176.5 and -234.9 +/- 145.9 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1)). If the carbon exported through the harvest of the Sphagnum biomass and the additional CO2 emission from the decay of the organic material is considered, the NECB and GWP100 balances are near neutral.
   Peat mining sites are likely to become net carbon sinks and a peat accumulating ("growing") peatland within 30 years of rewetting, but the GWP100 balance may still be positive. A recommended measure for rewetting is to achieve a water level of a few centimetres below ground.
   Sphagnum farming is a climate-friendly alternative to conventional commercial use of bogs. A year-round constant water level of a few centimetres below ground level should be maintained.

AB The influence of natural metal chelators on the bio-available iron input to the ocean by river water was studied. Ferrous and ferric ions present as suspended colloidal particles maintaining the semblance of a dissolved load are coagulated and settled as their freshwater carrier is mixed with seawater at the continental boundary. However, we might argue that different iron-binding colloids become sequentially destabilized in meeting progressively increasing salinities. By use of a Fe-59 tracer method, the partitioning of the iron load from the suspended and dissolved mobile fraction to storage in the sediments was measured with high accuracy in mixtures of natural river water with artificial sea water. The results show a characteristic sequence of sedimentation. Various colloids of different stability are removed from a water of increasing salinity, such as it is the case in the transition from a river water to the open sea. However, the iron transport capacities of the investigated river waters differed greatly. A mountainous river in the Austrian Alps would add only about 5% of its dissolved Fe load, that is about 2.0 mu g L-1 Fe, to coastal waters. A small tributary draining a sphagnum peat-bog, which acts as a source of refractory low-molecular-weight fulvic acids to the river water, would add approximately 20% of its original Fe load, that is up to 480 mu g L-1 Fe to the ocean's bio-available iron pool. This points to a natural mechanism of ocean iron fertilization by terrigenous fulvic-iron complexes originating from weathering processes occurring in the soils upstream.

AB Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), including 19 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 15 PAH-derivatives (oxygenated and nitrogen heterocyclic PAHs), were measured in streams in a remote headwater catchment in northern Europe and in more urbanized, downstream areas. Sampling was conducted during 2014 to 2016 and included the main hydrological seasons (snow-free, snow-covered, and spring flood) at six sampling sites. Levels of the targeted PACs varied substantially over time and space and were up to 110-fold (on average 17-fold) and 7000-fold (on average 670-fold) higher for PAHs and PAH-derivatives, respectively, during spring flood compared with preceding snow-covered and snow-free seasons. Higher levels of Sigma PACs were generally found in a headwater stream draining a mire than at an adjacent forested site, with up to 20 times and 150 times higher levels for Sigma PAH and Sigma PAH-derivatives, respectively. The particle-bound PAC levels were positively correlated to surface runoff in the mire stream (Sigma PAHs: p = 0.032; Sigma PAH-derivatives: p = 0.040) but not in the corresponding forest stream, during snowmelt and winter base flow. In more urbanized downstream areas, particle-bound PACs were instead strongly associated with suspended particulate matter (p < 0.05; Sigma PAHs and Sigma PAH-derivatives except one site). Levels of Sigma PACs in the streamwater were on average 3-fold higher downstream of the most densely populated area than at the outlet of the headwater catchment. The higher PAC levels in the downstream water compared to the remote headwater were clearer when normalized to SPM amounts (instead of water volume), with a gradual downstream trend between the sites.

AB The aim of the study was to assess changes in the position of the groundwater table in selected catchments in the Zielonka forest. The paper presents the results of researches carried out at Hutka small catchment up to Huta Pusta cross section and Potaszka small catchment up to Potasze cross station. Analyzed catchments of investigated watercourses are located in the central part of the Wielkopolska region, approx. 20 km north-east of Poznan, in the Zielonka Forest, at a distance of approx. 7 km from each other. The catchment of the Hutka watercourse, with an area of 0.52 km(2), is forested in 89%, the other 11% being covered by swamps and wasteland. The predominant sites are fresh mixed coniferous forest (BMsw), fresh coniferous forest (Bsw) and alder swamp forest (Ol). The catchment of the Potaszka watercourse is over two times bigger, with an area of 1.33 km(2). Here forest cover only 14.7% catchment area, arable land (GO) occupies approx. 75%, while grassland (UZ) constitutes 10.3%. Landscape in both catchments is characterized by a large number of interior depressions, filled partly with rainwater or peat bogs, with poorly developed natural drainage
   During the research detailed analyses were made for the dynamics of the ground water level. The researches curried out in different habitat conditions in watercourses Hutka and Potaszka catchement indicated that the highest amplitudes oscillations ground-water levels, in winter and summer hydrological half-year, occurred in older swamp forest, whereas the smallest in fresh mixed coniferous forest.
   The research proved, that the dynamics of the soils humidity variation and ground water level in analyzed drainage catchment is described by similar cyclist and depends mostly on the course of meteorological conditions, especially on the distribution and dimension of rainfalls. It was confirmed that the low level of groundwater table in the vegetation season does not affect significantly the water reserves of the surface layer of soil. Additional elements affecting the level of ground water are also: the distance between measuring wells and the watercourse, site type and the layout of the land.

We hypothesized that the abundant presence of gray birch is a relatively recent phenomenon associated with human activities that are creating conditions favorable to the establishment of this species. We analyzed dendrochronological, plant-macrofossil, aerial photographs and climatic data for 10 sites. All of the peatlands recently experienced a major increase in forest cover. The first sign of gray birch establishment dates back to the 1950s, although at over half of sites, establishment took place after 1980. Abundant macroremains of the species were found only in the upper portion of peat deposits. Birch encroachment most often occurred after a fire had spread through the peatland. Increasing agricultural and draining activities on the periphery of the peatlands, that coincides with drier climatic conditions, likely induced a drying out of the peat, thereby creating conditions propitious for fire and subsequent germination and growth of birch seeds.

AB Nutrient availability is an important control on the vegetation distribution, productivity and functioning of peatland ecosystems and we examined spatial and temporal patterns of nutrient availability through ion exchange at Mer Bleue bog, southeast Ontario, Canada. We installed ion exchange probes at 5-15 cm for 4 weeks and determined nutrient sorption at undisturbed sites as well as those affected by nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) fertilization and drainage. Under undisturbed conditions, the bog had very small amount of available nutrients, especially N(ammonium > nitrate) and P, and exhibited small variations in nutrient availability during the growing season (May to October). The increase in NPK availability upon fertilization was short-lived over the season and the stoichiometry of available NPK captured by the probes was mismatched with the vegetation. The increase in nutrient availability with drainage was confounded by substantial changes in vegetation. We compare these results with data from other Canadian bogs and fens to provide baseline data on nutrient availability in peatlands. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The initiation and growth of boreal peatlands developed on well-drained, sandy landforms are closely associated with podzolic soil paludification processes. The origin of Sphagnum bogs extending on large deltaic plains was examined to test the hypothesis of the dual impact of indurated (ortstein) podzols and fire on forest soil paludification and concurrent peatland initiation and expansion. Mineral soil, basal organic matter and peat monoliths were sampled for soil and macrofossil analyses along an 800-m toposequence starting from a mixed-wood boreal forest to a Sphagnum bog (Lebel bog, eastern Quebec, Canada), and ending at a peat dome in the thickest section of the peatland. Mineral soils along the toposequence are ortstein humo-ferric podzols distributed in the forest environment and beneath Sphagnum peat in the bog, except at the peat dome. Initial peatland growth occurred c.6000cal. a BP. Soil paludification coincided with the cessation of fire occurrence as recorded in the organic and mineral layers preceding Sphagnum expansion. Unlike most temperate and boreal raised bogs, the Sphagnum bog developed directly from a forest environment without passing through a transitional fen stage. Conifer forests regenerated successively after several fires between 4200 and 1600cal. a BP before bog expansion. Pre-bog forests were composed of fire-prone black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) trees, and ericaceous species. Given the distribution and thickness of ortstein horizons progressively decreasing and disappearing towards the peatland dome, growth and expansion of the Sphagnum bog was not caused by soil induration processes, which could have potentially impeded vertical and horizontal drainage. The development of indurated podzols outside and several hundred metres inside the peatland preceded the initiation and expansion of the Sphagnum bog. Cessation of fire activity appears to be a key factor facilitating the lateral expansion of the Sphagnum bog under wet soil conditions.

AB Documents on historical floras provide unique opportunities to analyze past changes and to show trends in biodiversity. We studied the historical and recent flora of the city of Halle in Central Germany. Our earliest records date back to the year 1687; the youngest were sampled in 2008. More than 20 other floras provide information for time in-between, covering ca. 320 years in total. We checked all historical plant occurrences for plausibility. The species turnover of 22% that took place in the study period should also yield changes in the functional composition of the flora. We identified native species and archaeophytes that went extinct since 1689 and 1856, respectively, and all neophytes that were introduced since 1689 or 1856. This 'double' calculation minimized the influence of so-called possible pseudo-absences. Contingency tables assisted to identify trait states which were associated with extinction or introduction. Time-series analysis identified temporal trends in trait state ratio development after testing for temporal autocorrelation. Within the study period, species of bogs, nitrogen-poor habitats or plants with helomorphic leaves got extinct more often than expected by chance. Species dispersed by humans, plants preferring nitrogen-rich or warm habitats, shrubs and trees, and species with mesomorphic leaves were, amongst others, over-represented among introduced neophytes. Land-use changes such as the transformation from agriculture to urban land use or the drainage of bogs are discussed as main drivers of these developments. Additionally, climatic changes, contamination of habitats and gardeners' preferences for specific plants are presumed to having caused floristic changes. Our study shows the vast influence humans had and still have on biodiversity by intentionally or unintentionally selecting specific functional plant types and thus changing the composition of the flora.

TI Use of a novel camera trapping approach to measure small mammal

DE Blanket bog; Plantation forestry; Rodent; Shrew; Trail camera; Vole
AB Small mammals, such as small rodents (Rodentia: Muroidea) and shrews (Insectivora: Soricidae), present particular challenges in camera trap surveys. Their size is often insufficient to trigger infra-red sensors, whilst resultant images may be of inadequate quality for species identification. The conventional survey method for small mammals, live-trapping, can be both labour-intensive and detrimental to animal welfare. Here, we describe a method for using camera traps for monitoring small mammals. We show that by attaching the camera trap to a baited tunnel, fixing a close-focus lens over the camera trap lens, and reducing the flash intensity, pictures or videos can be obtained of sufficient quality for identifying species. We demonstrate the use of the method by comparing occurrences of small mammals in a peatland landscape containing (i) plantation forestry (planted on drained former blanket bog), (ii) ex-forestry areas undergoing bog restoration, and (iii) unmodified blanket bog habitat. Rodents were detected only in forestry and restoration areas, whilst shrews were detected across all habitat. The odds of detecting small mammals were 7.6 times higher on camera traps set in plantation forestry than in unmodified bog, and 3.7 times higher on camera traps in restoration areas than in bog. When absolute abundance estimates are not required, and camera traps are available, this technique provides a low-cost survey method that is labour-efficient and has minimal animal welfare implications.

AB The St-Charles Plain (Kent County, New Brunswick, Canada) commercial peat moss operation has been ongoing since 1983. To process the peat, a dry extraction method is used that requires extensive drainage of the peat bog. The water is directed toward sedimentation ponds, where it drains into a small brook, which feeds into a river affected by tidal salt water. Water discharge from the bog contains large amounts of peat particles that deposit in the surrounding watershed. As a result, the pH of the freshwater sites that receive the drainage water from the commercial operation, is fairly acidic (pH 3.9-4.7). Water samples from or near the peat moss operation have a higher concentration of total phosphorous and total organic carbon. The peat particles contain relatively high levels of total mercury, as reflected by analysis of peat sediments. However, the water samples contained low levels of dissolved mercury. Indigenous samples of biota-namely, sand shrimps (Crangon septemspinosa) and mummichogs (Fundulus heteroelitus)-did not contain mercury levels higher in the impacted sites than in the reference sites. Introduced blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) did not accumulate significant amounts of mercury during a 62-day exposure in the study area. Overall, the data suggest that although relatively large amounts of mercury-containing peat particles are discharged into the ecosystem, bioaccumulation of mercury in the biota does not occur.

AB Isotopic data are increasingly being used to quantify and understand the processes that control the release of carbon (C) from northern peatlands. We used delta C-13 and C-14 measurements to investigate the source and age of different forms of aquatic C (DOC, POC and evasion CO2) released from 2 contrasting (undrained v drained) forested peatland catchments at the end of the winter snowmelt period in boreal E Finland. The delta C-13(VPDB) values of DOC (range -28.3 to -28.8 aEuro degrees) were generally more C-13 depleted than evasion CO2 (range -22.7 to -31.5 aEuro degrees) and showed no clear differences between the pre-flood, flood and post-flood periods. Both forms of C had evidence of bomb-C-14 (i.e. > 100%modern), indicating that they contained substantial quantities of C fixed since the mid AD 1950s. However, DOC was C-14 enriched compared to evasion CO2, with C-14 concentrations suggesting that, on average, DOC-C was similar to 5-6 years younger than evasion CO2-C, with the most recently fixed C being released when temperatures were highest. POC was significantly depleted in C-14 with conventional (uncalibrated) radiocarbon ages of 805-1135 BP. In contrast to other studies, the isotopic compositions of DOC and evasion CO2 were very similar, suggesting a predominantly single and consistent C source (decomposition of soil organic matter; SOM) during the snowmelt period. Whilst we found no evidence to suggest that old (pre-bomb) C was being released at the end of the winter period, the drained site was associated with more C-14 depleted and C-13 enriched evasion CO2, suggesting a closer link to the atmospheric CO2 pool. Our isotopic data suggest that the various forms of C released to the aquatic system from these forested Finnish peatlands are closely related, largely unaffected by drainage and (at least in the case of evasion CO2 and DOC) indicate strong connectivity between C cycling in the soil-plant-water system.

AB The present study consisted of an evaluation of assemblages of epigeic carabid beetles (Col.

The observations were conducted on a drained, low bog area called Stary Dwor, which today is used as a cut meadow. This is an oblong depression, filled in with (partly mucky) rush peats and situated in the sandur landscape. It lies in the mesoregion called Pojezierze Olsztynskie (Olsztyn Lake District) near Olsztyn (UTM DE 65), about 3 km of the southern borders of the town. The field observations for determination of the soil type were conducted using soil catenas. A transect was established, which cut across different types and sub-types of bog and post-bog soils. In this paper, the authors have attempted to answer the question whether the sequence of hydrogenic soils and some parameters chosen to describe them have any influence on assemblages of epigeic carabid beetles dwelling in such habitats. Based on the results, it has been concluded that the soils present in the analyzed peat bog were characterized by the following sequence: muckous soils -> peat-muck soils -> peat soils. Their properties depended on the position in the soil relief, advancement of muck formation and content of organic carbon. It has been found out that the highest soil ash content in the surface horizons was in muckous soil (90.39%), and the lowest - in profile 3 of peat-muck soil (18.77%). The reaction of the analyzed soils ranged from slightly acidic to neutral and tended to decrease towards the centre of the depression, reaching the lowest value in peat soil. During the two years of our observations, a total of 673 individuals of Carabidae belonging to 29 species were captured. It has been determined that the type of soil as a factor significantly affected the number of captured carabid beetles, but did not influence the species abundance. The decreasing pH gradient as well as an increasing content of organic C were associated with a decreasing number of the species of carabid beeetles tolerant to moisture conditions (mesophilous species), which were being replaced by hygrophilous individuals. As the acidic reaction of soil increased and the soil content of organic matter rose, so did the abundance of mixophagous species at the expense of predatory individuals.

AB The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and methane (CH4) flux were measured by chamber measurements for five distinct ecotypes (areas with unique eco-hydrological characteristics) at Abbeyleix Bog in the Irish midlands over a 2-year period. The ecotypes ranged from those with high-quality peat-forming vegetation to communities indicative of degraded, drained conditions. Three of these ecotypes were located in an area where peat was extracted by hand and then abandoned and left to revegetate naturally at least 50 years prior to the start of the study. Two of the ecotypes were located on an adjacent raised bog, which although never mined for peat, was impacted by shallow drainage and then restored (by drain blocking) 6 years prior to the start of the study. Other major aspects of the carbon (C) balance, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and open-water CO2 evasion, were quantified for a catchment area at the study site over the same 2-year period. The ecotype average annual ecotype C balance ranged from a net C sink of -58 +/- 60 gCm(-2) yr(-1), comparable to studies of intact peatlands, to a substantial C source of C +205 +/- 80 gC m(-2) yr(-1), with NEE being the most variable component of the C balance among the five ecotypes. Ecotype annual CH4 flux ranged from 2.7 +/- 1.4 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) to 14.2 +/- 4.8 g C-CH4 m(-2)yr(-1). Average annual aquatic C losses were 14.4 gCm(-2) yr(-1) with DOC, DIC, and CO2 evasion of 10.4 g Cm(-2)yr(-1), 1.3 g Cm-2 yr(-1), and 2.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1), respectively. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the mean annual water table (MAWT) and the plot-scale NEE but not the global warming potential (GWP). However, a significant negative correlation was observed between the plot-scale percentage of Sphagnum moss cover and the GWP, highlighting the importance of regenerating this keystone genus as a climate change mitigation strategy in peatland restoration. The data from this study were then compared to the rapidly growing number of peatland C balance studies across boreal and temperate regions. The trend in NEE and CH4 flux with respect to MAWT was compared for the five ecotypes in this study and literature data from degraded/restored/recovering peatlands, intact peatlands, and bare peat sites.

AB One purpose of new land use concepts for degraded fens (organic soils with high N content) is the reduction of the mineralization process due to very high groundwater levels. However, knowledge of nitrogen mineralization process (net and gross) in degraded fen soils affected by reflooding is very small. Therefore, the objectives of our study were (a) to evaluate the suitability of N-15 pool dilution method for measurements of gross mineralization rates in degraded fen soils and (b) to investigate how the reflooding of a degraded fen affects the net and gross nitrogen mineralization in a shortterm incubation experiment. The usability of the N-15 pool dilution method was diminished by the low recovery of the applied (NH4+)-N-15 at time zero. The recovery of the added (NH4+)-N-15 in the extractable soil NH4+ pool was only 13.5% for the drained soil and 59.6% for the reflooded soil. However, the gross mineralization rates were similar for both soils and exceeded always the net rates substantially. The cumulative net mineralization rate was higher for the reflooded soil (1.58 mu g N*cm(-3)*d(-1)) than for the drained soil (-0.67 mu g N*cm(-3)*d(-1)). Differences between the two soils were also found in the nitrification intensity and the loss of N-15. This was probably one reason for the higher net mineralization rate in the reflooded soil.

AB The aquatic pathway is increasingly being recognized as an important component of catchment carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets, particularly in peatland systems due to their large carbon store and strong hydrological connectivity. In this study, we present a complete 5-year data set of all aquatic carbon and GHG species from an ombrotrophic Scottish peatland. Measured species include particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2, CH4 and N2O. We show that short-term variability in concentrations exists across all species and this is strongly linked to discharge. Seasonal cyclicity was only evident in DOC, CO2 and CH4 concentration; however, temperature correlated with monthly means in all species except DIC. Although the temperature correlation with monthly DOC and POC concentrations appeared to be related to biological productivity in the terrestrial system, we suggest the temperature correlation with CO2 and CH4 was primarily due to in-stream temperature-dependent solubility. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon concentration was strongly correlated with catchment gross primary productivity (GPP) indicating a strong potential terrestrial aquatic linkage. DOC represented the largest aquatic carbon flux term (19.3 +/- 4.59g Cm-2yr-1), followed by CO2 evasion (10.0g Cm-2yr-1). Despite an estimated contribution to the total aquatic carbon flux of between 8 and 48%, evasion estimates had the greatest uncertainty. Interannual variability in total aquatic carbon export was low in comparison with variability in terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere exchange, and could be explained primarily by temperature and precipitation. Our results therefore suggest that climatic change is likely to have a significant impact on annual carbon losses through the aquatic pathway, and as such, aquatic exports are fundamental to the understanding of whole catchment responses to climate change.

AB A suite of autogenic ecohydrological feedbacks and moss traits are important for protecting vast peatland carbon stocks following wildfire disturbance. Here, we examine how peat burn severity and water table depth (WTD) affect the strength of one such feedback-the hydrophobicity-evaporation feedback (HEF). The HEF is an evaporation-limiting feedback known to minimize water loss following wildfire. The peatland surface becomes hydrophobic creating an evaporative cap and thereby reducing post-fire evaporation; however, recent studies hypothesize that this is dependent on peat burn severity. To test this hypothesis, we studied plots along a peat burn severity gradient in a partially drained black spruce peatland that burned during the 2016 Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire. Evaporation rates were significantly lower in plots where hydrophobicity was present. Hydrophobicity was lowest in the severely burned area, and the average instantaneous evaporation rate (2.75 mm day(-1)) was significantly higher than moderately and typical-lightly burned areas (0.82 and 1.64 mm day(-1), respectively). Based on lab results, increasing WTD affected hydrophobicity within lightly burned (singed) feather moss samples but not in heavily burned feather moss, showing the importance of post-fire ground cover and in situ WTD. Our results provide evidence of a burn severity threshold where increased depth of burn removes the feather moss evaporative cap and causes the HEF to break down. We argue that this threshold has important implications for boreal peatlands, which are predicted to undergo climate-mediated pre-fire drying and increasing burn severities, potentially leading to further carbon losses due to enhanced post-fire drying and concomitant decomposition.

TI Population trends of Finnish lepidoptera during 1961-1996
SO ENTOMOLOGICA FENNICA

DT Article
ID SYNCHRONY; DYNAMICS
AB Based on a query and on a literature review, the population trends of Finnish Lepidoptera since Kaisila's (1962) thorough overview are analysed. Changes in the belt of three coastal biogeographical provinces (V-EK) show significant correlations with those in three inland provinces (St-ES). Furthermore, positive trends in these belts are reflected as new provincial finds north of them. The spatial synchrony is supposedly caused by spatially correlated climatic conditions. This is supported by evidence of synchronous trends in species grouped according to their overwintering stages (Marttila 1991, Bruun 1992). The increased migration rate, indicated by the new provincial finds, is probably a consequence of high population densities, and does not explain the synchrony itself. Kaisila's division into expansive and fluctuant species is considered to be a historical rather than a biological characterization. During the 19th century, the reporting of new lepidopteran species was delayed by about 50 years if they were night-active vs. day-active. The low numbers of observers and slow development of collecting methods have caused further analytical uncertainties. Some of Kaisila's expansive species may actually have been inhabitants of Finland for long periods of time. At present, drainage of peatlands and overgrowth of meadows are the most adverse environmental changes causing a decline of lepidopterans, particularly of the butterflies. Increase of bushiness and reeds appear to have positively affected many geometrid and noctuid species. The high incidence of new provincial finds and of species new to the country in the 1990s as well as positive trends in late-autumn and early-spring species supposedly reflect the ongoing climatic change. The Finnish lepidopteran fauna is undergoing a dynamic phase: around 30 recent invaders and 40 older expansive species are spreading, while fewer are retreating; the declining species are mainly habitat specialists while the expansive ones are generalists, mainly feeding on bushes and trees. Fewer expansions are evident among micro-than macrolepidopterans.

AB This study aimed to clarify the distribution trend of sapric peat soils in Japanese agricultural fields from the view point of drainage and landform conditions using the Geographic Information System (GIS). To this end, the environmental conditions in the distribution area of organic soils were divided by combining existing GIS databases of environmental factors that consist of groundwater level, drainage condition, landform classification, and grain size of sediment. In order to evaluate the contribution of these environmental factors to the distribution trend of sapric peat soils, we applied quantification method type II to construct the discrimination model that enables the differentiation of the distribution area of sapric and non-sapric peat soils. In the case of organic soils without mineral surface cover, our discrimination model clearly suggests that sapric peat soils tend to be distributed under good drainage condition on floodplains, and with coarse sediments. This indicates that the effect of drainage conditions on peat decomposition is determined by landform condition. On the other hand, in the case of the land covered with mineral soils on the surface, sapric peat soil distribution was not well estimated. Determining the relationships between the distribution trend of sapric peat soils and the environmental factors by analyzing the existing GIS database is a new application. This was achieved by the combination of GIS and quantification method type II, which contributes to the description of the peat decomposition process from the viewpoint of geographical conditions.

AB Canadian peatlands are subject to disturbance and destruction, and drainage for agriculture is responsible for 85% of this degradation Few studies have explicitly addressed the effects of habitat degradation on arthropod diversity in Nearctic peatlands Because higher Diptera (Brachycera) in peatlands are diverse, are an important component of food webs, and exhibit a wide range of ecological requirements, we examined species richness, abundance, and community composition of Brachycera across transects at 1, 6, and 11 m from a collector drainage ditch in Johnville Bog and Forest Park, Quebec In total, 1453 Brachycera were collected, representing 24 families and 166 species Species diversity (based on Simpson's diversity index) and rarefaction-estimated species richness were higher at 6 and 11 m than at 1 m from the ditch, probably because of the homogeneous moss cover and moister conditions at greater distance from the ditch. Species composition also differed between 1 m and other distances, based on cluster analysis, multiresponse permutation procedures analysis, and the presence of five predaceous species that were significant indicator species 1 m from the drainage ditch. Our results suggest that anthropogenic degradation of hydrological conditions may be responsible for the low species richness and high dominance of a few species currently seen at the ditch margin

AB Intensive seismic exploration in the Northwest Territories began in the late 1960s. Since that time, the legacy of seismic surveys - i.e. straight lines cutting through boreal forest and tundra - has remained visible throughout northern Canada and Alaska. The removal of trees and compaction of the ground surface alter the thermophysical properties of the active (i.e. seasonally thawed) layer to such an extent that the underlying permafrost seriously degrades or even disappears completely. Such a transformation along linear corridors that cut indiscriminately across different terrain types with contrasting hydrological functions has potentially serious implications to the redistribution of water and energy within and among landscape units with feedbacks to permafrost thaw, land cover change and run-off generation. This paper characterizes the flow and storage of water and energy along a seismic cut line in the high boreal zone of discontinuous permafrost in order to improve the understanding of these processes, their interactions and hydrological implications. As such, this paper lays a conceptual foundation for the development of numerical models needed to predict the hydrological and thermal impact of seismic lines in this sensitive region. We used ground-penetrating radar and multi-year ground temperatures and water levels along a seismic line to estimate the degree of permafrost degradation below it. The seismic line studied extends from a permafrost-free wetland (flat bog), over a permafrost body (peat plateau) and into another permafrost-free wetland (channel fen). It was found that once thaw had lowered the permafrost table below the ground surface elevation of the flat bog and channel fen, the seismic line forms a hydrological connection between them. It was also shown that during the permafrost thaw process, seismic lines develop a perennially thawed layer (talik) between the overlying active layer and underlying permafrost and that the talik conveys water as a conduit throughout the year. The implications of such drainage through seismic lines and networks on basin drainage in peatland-dominated regions with discontinuous permafrost are also discussed.

AB In a series of laboratory incubations using soils of two contrasting sites from a temperate marsh on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, potential methane (CH4) oxidation rates were measured to study the effects of inorganic N inputs on CH4 oxidation. For a drained site, subsurface peat (5-15 cm) at an initial 20 muL CH4 L-1 showed a significantly different (P < 0.05) CH4 oxidation rate compared to other soil depths, with a maximal rate of 20.9 ng CH4 gDW (dry weight)(-1) h(-1); the underlying mineral soil layers (15-30 and 30-50 cm) also had a strong CH4 oxidation capacity at about an initial 2000 muL CH4 L-1. With a waterlogged site, the CH4 oxidation rate in an aerobic incubation was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the surface soil layer (0-5 cm) compared to the 15-30 and 30-50 cm depths. There was generally no or a very weak effect from addition of NO3- on CH4 oxidation. In marked contrast, NH4+ salts, such as (NH4)(2)SO4, NH4Cl and NH4NO3, exhibited strong inhibitions, which varied as a function of the added salts and the initial CH4 level. Increasing NH4+ usually resulted in greater inhibition and increasing initial CH4 concentrations resulted in less. NH4+ inhibition on CH4 oxidation in natural high-altitude, low-latitude wetlands could be as important as has been reported for agricultural and forest soils. The NH4+ effects on the CH4 oxidation rate need to be further investigated in a wide range of natural wetland soil types.

AB Data from 24 544 pine-dominated plots of the Eighth National Forest Inventory (NFI) in southern Finland were used in this study. The most commonly identified cause of damage was Gremmeniella abietina (10.6% of the stands). Disease assessments by NFI groups were reliable at the stand level. The disease was spatially clustered, being almost twice as common on peatland as on mineral soil plots. However, there was no difference between undrained peatlands and mineral soils. The more the original peatland site type had changed after drainage, the more common was the disease. On mineral soil, disease frequencies were highest on alluviated plots or on the most fertile plots. Naturally regenerated stands were affected more than artificially regenerated stands, but the difference was significant only on the richer sites. The proportion of diseased plots increased with stand density up to 25-28 m(2) ha(-1). Elevation of the plot had only a weak effect on damage frequency.

AB We determined the lipid distributions (n-alkanes, n-alkan-2-ones, n-alkanoic acids), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), Ca/Mg and ash content in Las Conchas mire, a 3.2 m deep bryophyte-dominated mire in Northern Spain covering 8000 cal yr BP. Bog conditions developed in the bottom 20 cm of the profile, and good preservation of organic matter (OM) was inferred from n-alkanoic acid distribution, with the exception of the uppermost 20 cm (last ca. 200 yr). Microbial synthesis of long chain saturated fatty acids from primary OM likely produced a dominance of short chain n-alkanoic acids with a bimodal distribution, as well as the lack of correspondence between the n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid profiles in the upper 20 cm. This was accompanied by an increase in ash content, a decrease in TOC and variation in n-alkane ratios, thereby suggesting significant changes in the mire, namely drainage and transformation to a meadow, in the last ca. 200 yr. The distribution of n-alkan-2-ones indicated an increase in bacterial source from the bottom of the record to 94 cm, whereas their distribution in the upper part could be attributed mainly to plant input and/or the microbial oxidation of n-alkanes. The different n-alkane proxies showed variations, which we interpreted in terms of changes in vegetation (Sphagnum vs. non-Sphagnum dominated phases) during the last 8000 cal yr BP. C-23 was the most abundant homolog throughout most of the record, thereby suggesting dominant humid conditions alternating with short drier phases. However, such humid conditions were not linked to paleoclimatic variation but rather to geomorphological characteristics: Las Conchas mire, at the base of the Cuera Range, receives continuous runoff-even during drier periods-which is not necessarily accompanied by additional mineral input to peat, producing the development of Sphagnum moss typical of waterlogged ecotopes and damp habitats. Thus, although geochemical proxies indicated an ombrotrophic regime in the mire, geomorphological characteristics may make a considerable contribution to environmental conditions.

AB Following the 1654 elections, the first to be held after the imposition of the Instrument of Government, petitions of complaint were presented by voters from various constituencies to Cromwell and his council. Most of the petitions were investigated, some MPs being subsequently barred from taking their seats, but only one was excluded on the grounds of immorality: George Glapthorne, an MP for the Isle of Ely. This re-examination of his case indicates that Glapthorne, an unpopular local figure because of his involvement in drainage and enclosure, had been the subject of a successful smear campaign. The Instrument of Government had redefined the franchise, which, it has been argued, decreased the size of the electorate. Annexed to the petition presented by voters in the Isle was a list of 124 men who had been physically prevented from entering the polling hall. This list reveals the presence of Walloon settlers in the Isle; local records indicate that such men qualified for the new franchise because they were leasing fertile, drained land in the Fens, thus increasing the electorate in that area. By considering the local context of a disputed election, this study adds to the debate concerning the interpretation of the Instrument of Government in terms of the eligibility, not only of a parliamentary candidate, but also of voters.

AB To test the effects of altered hydrology on organic soil decomposition, we investigated CO2 and CH4 production potential of rich-fen peat (mean surface pH = 6.3) collected from a field water table manipulation experiment including control, raised and lowered water table treatments. Mean anaerobic CO2 production potential at 10 cm depth (14.1 +/- 0.9 mu mol C g(-1) d(-1)) was as high as aerobic CO2 production potential (10.6 +/- 1.5 mu mol C g(-1) d(-1)), while CH4 production was low (mean of 7.8 +/- 1.5 nmol C g(-1) d(-1)). Denitrification enzyme activity indicated a very high denitrification potential (197 +/- 23 mu g N g(-1) d(-1)), but net NO3- reduction suggested this was a relatively minor pathway for anaerobic CO2 production. Abundances of denitrifier genes (nirK and nosZ) did not change across water table treatments. SO42- reduction also did not appear to be an important pathway for anaerobic CO2 production. The net accumulation of acetate and formate as decomposition end products in the raised water table treatment suggested that fermentation was a significant pathway for carbon mineralization, even in the presence of NOT. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were the strongest predictors of potential anaerobic and aerobic CO2 production. Across all water table treatments, the CO2:CH4 ratio increased with initial DOC leachate concentrations. While the field water table treatment did not have a significant effect on mean CO2 or CH4 production potential, the CO2:CH4 ratio was highest in shallow peat incubations from the drained treatment. These data suggest that with continued drying or with a more variable water table, anaerobic CO2 production may be favored over CH4 production in this rich fen. Future research examining the potential for dissolved organic substances to facilitate anaerobic respiration, or alternative redox processes that limit the effectiveness of organic acids as substrates in anaerobic metabolism, would help explain additional uncertainty concerning carbon mineralization in this system.

AB Episodic surface water acidification is common in many regions worldwide; the driving processes are dependent on a variety of physicochemical and climatic characteristics, and acid deposition pressures, which have changed significantly over the last two decades. This study provided a unique opportunity to re-examine the drivers of acidity in an environment of low anthropogenic input. In three geologically distinct acid-sensitive regions of Ireland during 2009-2010, 34 headwater streams were evaluated in peat-dominated catchments draining moorlands without forest, 20-50% (low) forest cover and >50% (high) forest cover. Results indicated episodic acidity/alkalinity loss in headwater streams, despite significant reductions in acid deposition. Both the differences in pH between base and storm-flow (Delta pH) and the number of pH events <= 5.5 were higher in forested streams. Dissolved organic carbon and inorganic aluminium concentrations were also higher in forested catchments. The primary driver of acidity was strong organic anions, which generally increased with increasing forest cover. Base-cation dilution was also prominent in west and southern regions, while surprisingly chlorine anion acidity from sea-salts had little or no influence on stream acidity. The contributions of excess non-marine sulphate (xSO(4)) and nitrate (NO3) to storm-water were low, with no observed increases in xSO(4) with increasing forest cover, although contributions of NO3 were higher in forested catchments in the east. The results suggest that episodic acidification in Ireland is primarily driven by organic acids. However in peat dominant catchments, plantation forest, climate change and/or reductions in xSO(4) appear to also be having an effect on stream pH from increased DOC, with some forested streams previously unaffected by deposition now showing low pH (<5.5) during storm-flow. As quantified from this study, observed changes in stream acidification in Ireland may provide a better understanding of future chemical responses to declining acid deposition and climate change elsewhere.

TI THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PROTECTED AREAS FOR THE LAND BIRDS OF SOUTHERN
   FINLAND
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Protected areas (nature reserves) cover 0.7% of the land area in southern Finland (162,000 km2), which belongs to the south- and mid-boreal coniferous forest zones. The value of these areas in preserving land birds was studied on the basis of quantitative censuses. The numbers of bird pairs were estimated in nature reserves and in the whole of southern Finland, and the significance of the reserves was evaluated based on bow large a proportion of the total population in southern Finland was found in them. Forest habitat generalists and species of coniferous forests occurred in protected areas as expected by the proportion of these areas in southern Finland Specimens of these species groups comprise two thirds of all the country's land birds. Species of old-growth forests and open peatlands clearly preferred protected areas, whereas species of bushes, and lush and deciduous forest were scarcer in protected areas than elsewhere in southern Finland The latter fertile habitats are poorly represented in protected areas, even though due to their disappearance or alteration elsewhere several species confined to these habitats have declined and are even threatened. Drainage of open peatlands and clear cutting of old-growth forests has caused a decrease in the area of these habitats in southern Finland during the past decades. Therefore, protected areas have a high significance in preserving bird species preferring these habitats. Protected areas are particularly important for decreased species of old-growth forests, such as the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus and the Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus, as about 10% of their total population in southern Finland was estimated to breed in protected areas. The future protection of both old-growth and deciduous forests is important if we are to preserve biodiversity of land birds in Finland

AB Grasslands cover about 40% of the ice-free global terrestrial surface, but their quantitative importance in global carbon exchange with the atmosphere is still highly uncertain, and thus their potential for carbon sequestration remains speculative. Here, we report on CO2 exchange of an extensively used mountain hay meadow and pasture in the Swiss pre-Alps on high-organic soils (7-45% C by mass) over a 3-year period (18 May 2002-20 September 2005), including the European summer 2003 heat-wave period. During all 3 years, the ecosystem was a net source of CO2 (116-256 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Harvests and grazing cows (mostly via C export in milk) further increased these C losses, which were estimated at 355 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2003 (95% confidence interval 257-454 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Although annual carbon losses varied considerably among years, the CO2 budget during summer 2003 was not very different from the other two summers. However, and much more importantly, the winter that followed the warm summer of 2003 observed a significantly higher carbon loss when there was snow (133 +/- 6 g C m(-2)) than under comparable conditions during the other two winters (73 +/- 5 and 70 +/- 4 g C m(-2), respectively). The continued annual C losses can most likely be attributed to the long-term effects of drainage and peat exploitation that began 119 years ago, with the last significant drainage activities during the Second World War around 1940. The most realistic estimate based on depth profiles of ash content after combustion suggests that there is an 500-910 g C m(-2) yr(-1) loss associated with the decomposition of organic matter. Our results clearly suggest that putting efforts into preserving still existing carbon stocks may be more successful than attempts to increase sequestration rates in such high-organic mountain grassland soils.

AB Here, for the first time in SE Poland, we document the long-term development of a rich fen and assess its sensitivity to climate change and human impacts over the last ca. 3500 years. Our results are based on a high-resolution, continuous plant macrofossil remains, mollusc and pollen record, complemented by geochemical, mineral magnetic and physical characterisation, and radiocarbon dating from Bagno Serebryskie rich fen located in SE Poland. Based on the palaeoecological data we distinguished five stages of wet habitat conditions: 5000-3300, 2800-2150, 1600-1100, 750-230, 150-10 cal yr BP and five dry periods at ca. 3300-2800, 2150-1600, 1100-750, 230-150, 10 to 64 cal yr BP. The pollen and geochemistry records, particularly Pb, show that the first human activity in the study area occurred ca. 3200 cal yr BP and increased markedly from 500 cal yr BP affecting local plant development including the population size of Cladium mariscus. Our study has shown that despite human impact (drainage, fire), Bagno Serebryskie peatland has hosted rare, presently protected species, such as Cladium mariscus for hundreds of years. We conclude that, in common with ombrotrophic bogs, rich fen ecosystems can provide a reliable source of palaeoclimatic and palaeohydrological data. Our study also shows that a large peatland (376 ha) can be as sensitive a palaeohydrological archive as smaller mires. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID VEGETATION
AB Drainage of the 6,000 ha Hula Lake and peatland in northern Israel in the late 1950s caused the loss of a very diverse and rare ecosystem and an important phytogeographic meeting zone for Holarctic and Palaeotropical species. Draining the Hula peatland was only partially successful in creating a large fertile area for cultivation, and in 1994 this led the authorities to re-flood 100 ha of the valley-the Agamon (Agmon)-with the aim of rehabilitating the diverse wetland landscape, promoting ecotourism and creating a clear-water body that would contribute to the purification of Lake Kinneret. The vegetation of the restored wetland was monitored for ten years (1997-2006), recording the establishment and abundance of vascular plant species. More than 20 emergent, submerged and riparian species became established. Like a number of other shallow-water wetlands, the Agmon is characterised by considerable ecological fluctuations. This has been expressed in prominent floristic changes in the Agamon since it was created. An increased abundance of Ceratophyllum demersum and Najas minor and a decline in Potamogeton spp., Najas delilel and filamentous algae have been observed. A long-term decline in water level and sediment accumulation has brought about a significant rise in the incidence of Phragmites australis, Typha domingensis and Ludwigia stolonifera in the south-eastern area. A GIS analysis of changes in species dominance shows fluctuations over the years, with only a partial trend of succession towards a P. australis, T. domingensis and L. stolonifera community.

AB Carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios of zooplankton are potentially good indicators of energy and nutrient fluxes, and trophic interactions in lake food-webs, yet, are poorly understood. Based on a synoptic survey of 233 boreal lakes, we evaluated the relationships of water chemistry, hydromorphological, and land cover variables (lake/catchment-specific factors), and the spatial position of lakes in the landscape (representing potential regional factors) with the delta C-13 and delta N-15 of nine meso-zooplankton taxa. The delta C-13 variation of most taxa was negatively related to water chemistry variables associated with allochthonous inputs (colour/dissolved organic carbon), and positively correlated with nutrient concentrations (together explaining 12-69% of variation). Most of the delta C-13 variation explained by significant hydromorphological and land cover variables (% peat area, drainage basin area:lake area, shoreline development index, and lake area, explaining 26-47% of variation) was shared by significant water chemistry variables. Together, this suggests that delta C-13 variation of zooplankton reflects different environmental influences on delta C-13 of lake primary producers. The delta N-15 variation of most taxa was significantly related to pH, total phosphorous concentration (water chemistry variables, explaining 8-64% of variation), and water retention time (hydromorphological variable, explaining 13-87% of variation). These relationships are probably reflective of the association of zooplankton delta N-15 with terrestrial organic matter flux, environmentally-induced biogeochemical nitrogen transformations and phytoplankton N-15 fractionation. Specific water chemistry, hydromorphological, and land cover predictors of delta C-13 and delta N-15 and the direction of their effects (i.e. positive or negative) were largely similar among taxa. However, their degree of importance varied among taxa particularly for delta C-13, probably due to contrasting feeding selectivity and resulting differences in allochthony. This suggests that delta C-13 of different taxa may respond differently to changes in limnological gradients due to environmental perturbations affecting boreal regions. The lake/catchment-specific factors were more important than regional factors (lithology, soil properties and atmospheric nitrogen deposition; which are represented by the spatial position of lakes) in explaining delta C-13 and delta N-15 variation of zooplankton. Hence, before inferring regional effects in stable isotope studies, the influence of lake/catchment-specific factors needs to be explicitly quantified.

AB Fluxes of the three main greenhouse gases (GHG) CO2, CH4 and N2O from peat and other soils with high organic carbon contents are strongly controlled by water table depth. Information about the spatial distribution of water level is thus a crucial input parameter when upscaling GHG emissions to large scales. Here, we investigate the potential of statistical modeling for the regionalization of water levels in organic soils when data covers only a small fraction of the peatlands of the final map. Our study area is Germany. Phreatic water level data from 53 peatlands in Germany were compiled in a new data set comprising 1094 dip wells and 7155 years of data. For each dip well, numerous possible predictor variables were determined using nationally available data sources, which included information about land cover, ditch network, protected areas, topography, peatland characteristics and climatic boundary conditions. We applied boosted regression trees to identify dependencies between predictor variables and dip-well-specific long-term annual mean water level (WL) as well as a transformed form (WLt). The latter was obtained by assuming a hypothetical GHG transfer function and is linearly related to GHG emissions. Our results demonstrate that model calibration on WLt is superior. It increases the explained variance of the water level in the sensitive range for GHG emissions and avoids model bias in subsequent GHG upscaling. The final model explained 45% of WLt variance and was built on nine predictor variables that are based on information about land cover, peatland characteristics, drainage network, topography and climatic boundary conditions. Their individual effects on WLt and the observed parameter interactions provide insight into natural and anthropogenic boundary conditions that control water levels in organic soils. Our study also demonstrates that a large fraction of the observed WLt variance cannot be explained by nationally available predictor variables and that predictors with stronger WLt indication, relying, for example, on detailed water management maps and remote sensing products, are needed to substantially improve model predictive performance.

AB Climate change mediated drying of boreal peatlands is expected to enhance peatland afforestation and wildfire vulnerability. The water table depth-afforestation feedback represents a positive feedback that can enhance peat drying and consolidation and thereby increase peat burn severity; exacerbating the challenges and costs of wildfire suppression efforts and potentially shifting the peatland to a persistent source of atmospheric carbon. To address this wildfire management challenge, we examined burn severity across a gradient of drying in a black spruce dominated peatland that was partially drained in 1975-1980 and burned in the 2016 Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire. We found that post-drainage black spruce annual ring width increased substantially with intense drainage. Average (+/- SD) basal diameter was 2.6 +/- 1.2 cm, 3.2 +/- 2.0 cm and 7.9 +/- 4.7 cm in undrained (UD), moderately drained (MD) and heavily drained (HD) treatments, respectively. Depth of burn was significantly different between treatments (p < 0.001) and averaged (+/- SD) 2.5 +/- 3.5 cm, 6.4 +/- 5.0 cm and 36.9 +/- 29.6 cm for the UD, MD and HD treatments, respectively. The high burn severity in the HD treatment included 38% of the treatment that experienced combustion of the entire peat profile, and we estimate that overall 51% of the HD pre-burn peat carbon stock was lost. We argue that the HD treatment surpassed an ecohydrological tipping point to high severity peat burn that may be identified using black spruce stand characteristics in boreal plains bogs. While further studies are needed, we believe that quantifying this threshold will aid in developing effective adaptive management techniques and protecting boreal peatland carbon stocks.

AB The butterflies which complete their entire life cycle within peatland habitats were documented in the Lake Superior drainage basin of northwestern Wisconsin. Seventy peatlands were inventoried over the course of the 1996 growing season, and were classified as either muskeg, kettlehole, or coastal sites. Muskeg peatlands were of similar elevation to the surrounding uplands, possessed drier and more nutrient-poor substrates, and were typically larger than other peatland types. Kettlehole peatlands were wetter and had floating Sphagnum mats which fringed lake margins or were in depressions much lower than the surrounding uplands. Coastal peatlands were located in estuaries along the Lake Superior coast, and possessed relatively eutrophic, wet soils. Muskeg sites harbored the most diverse total fauna, and possessed the highest average number of taxa per site. a highly significant correlation between habitat size and butterfly richness was observed in both muskeg and kettlehole peatlands. The muskeg fauna included five taxa not found in other peatland habitats. These species have arctic-boreal affinities and reach their southern range limit in eastern North America an these sites.

AB Tephra-dated, high-resolution pollen profiles from Ketilsstaoir, southern Iceland, indicate a largely unwooded pre-settlement environment, a probable consequence of the exposed coastal location. The degree of change associated with the Norse landnam is more limited than in many Icelandic pollen diagrams. There are three main periods of change in the post-settlement vegetational development of the area. Firstly, Norse settlement affected the hydrology of the bog, resulting in the near-disappearance of Sphagnum and agricultural activity led to a reduction of some species (e.g. Angelica spp. and, Salix). Secondly, the establishment of probable permanent settlement in the mid-11th century AD initiated expansion of such apophytic taxa as Plantago spp. Lactuceae, Ranunculus spp. and Pteridophytes. Thirdly, the >= 10 cm thick Katla tephra, deposited in AD 1357, enhanced drainage of the bog surface, favouring dryland taxa (e.g. Poaceae, Galium and Lactuceae). The tephra deposit and the associated drainage probably caused or contributed to the local extinction of the wetland beetle Hydraena britteni. The study has enabled a series of natural and humanly-related issues to be addressed including tephra-vegetation relationships, the anthropogenic reduction in plant diversity, and comparisons between historical and environmental settlement records.

AB Winter roads provide an important transportation service in northern regions. The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR), traversing subarctic Canada, is the busiest heavy-haul road in the world with as many as 10,900 truckloads per season. In addition to lake-ice thickness, trafficability on the TCWR depends upon adequate freezeback of overland portages, which are primarily peatlands underlain by discontinuous permafrost. We investigate threshold requirements for the initiation of winter road operations in this region and assess the use of a recommended 305 degrees C-day air-freezing index (FDD305a) value as an operational predictor of ground freezing at 30 cm depth, the desired depth to allow winter road construction to commence. Snow compaction and flooding were found to enhance freezeback of portages with early winter overland flow having a similar effect. The majority of winter road portages were not adequately frozen to a depth of 30 cm by FDD305a. Our results indicate that for drained and wet peatlands in this discontinuous permafrost environment, an FDD a threshold of 1100 degrees Cdays is more appropriate than the 305 degrees C-day threshold. However, TCWR winter road operators presently plan the construction of the winter road by a calendar date rather than by evaluation of the air-freezing index. This practice results in a conservative approach to the start of the construction season, close to 1100 degrees C-days with a higher percentage of sites frozen to 30 cm depth than would be if the 305 degrees C-day air-freezing index was used as a guideline. In addition, the use of low-pressure vehicles for snow compaction during the start of the construction season is an effective adaptation practice to accelerate freezing penetration.

AB The occurrence of mycobacteria was studied in aerobic brook sediments from 39 drainage areas in Finland, The culturable counts of mycobacteria were related to climatic conditions, characteristics of the drainage area, chemical characteristics of the sediment and water, culturable counts of other heterotrophic bacteria, and microbial respiration rate in the sediment. The counts of mycobacteria varied from 1.1 x 10(2) to 15 x 10(4) cfu g(-1) dry weight of sediment. They correlated positively with the proportion of the drainage area consisting of peatland, total content of C, content of Pb, microbial respiration rate in the sediment, and chemical oxygen demand of the water. The correlations of the mycobacterial counts with pH of sediment and alkalinity of water were negative. The results of the present sediment study and of the forest soil study published earlier strongly suggest that an increase in acidity increases the counts of mycobacteria and decreases the counts and activity of other heterotrophic bacteria. Mycobacterial counts were more than 100 times higher (per dry weight) in forest soils with pH 3.5-4.3 than in sediments with pH 4.5-6.3.

AB Fluvial erosion of peat deposits occurs in many environmental settings: however, the erosion and transport of large peat blocks by river channels has received relatively little attention. This paper describes the sedimentary significance and potential palaeoenvironmental interpretation of peat blocks in alluvial river systems. Evidence is presented from a number of field studies of upland river systems in northern England that illustrate a range of peat block forms and sedimentary features that are briefly compared with examples of peat blocks preserved in gravel stratigraphy. We show that peat blocks are an important geomorphological and sedimentological component of upland rivers draining eroding peatland catchments. They are of widespread occurrence and contribute significantly to river channel roughness and channel sedimentation. A variety of common sedimentary features can be observed including, shadow, crescent, perched, armoured, drape, embedded (part buried), cluster, and step forms. Peat blocks tend to be deposited on channel margins and bar tops and can be used as "maximum" stage indicator for major floods. The role of peat blocks in controlling sedimentation varies with channel width. In narrow channels where the size of the peat block approximates the channel width, blocks become jammed in the channel and exert a primary control on channel sedimentation. In wider channels, blocks tend to occur in isolation or in small clusters and are of only secondary importance in controlling sedimentation. Residence times of peat blocks varies from short periods of temporary deposition (days to months) to much longer timescales (months to years) with some blocks becoming permanently incorporated into the sedimentary record. The sedimentary characteristics of contemporary buried peat blocks have much in common with blocks preserved in alluvial gravel stratigraphy. This offers the potential for using these features for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Peat blocks in many ways are analogous to other low density geological materials (ice blocks, woody debris, and some volcanic sediments), and recognising the special sedimentological characteristics of this suite of materials is important as they are not always adequately characterised using conventional hydraulic relationships.

AB Ladder fen peatlands have excellent potential for wastewater polishing as they naturally contain both open water (pools) and subsurface (peat) treatment landforms; however, there is a poor understanding of solute transport in ladder fens with and without the increased hydrological load imposed by wastewater discharge. To better understand solute transport in ladder fens under wastewater polishing conditions a continuous solute (NaCl) tracer experiment (38 m(3) day(-1) of water, chloride - 47.2 mg L-1, and sodium - 25.3 mg L-1) was conducted during the summer of 2014 (day of year 192-243) in a small ladder fen in the James Bay Lowland. The transmissivity distribution and effective porosity (average 0.5) of the peat ribs were determined through repeated bail tests and the drainable porosity of 18 peat cores at -100 mb, respectively. Water samples were taken at least every 7 days to capture the solute (sodium and chloride) plumes. Both solute plumes never reached the site outflow similar to 250 m downgradient) and displayed complex plume morphology, typically following the patterns of higher hydraulic conductivity within the upper 0.1 m of the saturated peat, rather than the microtopography. Based on the 50% breakthrough isotherms, sodium and chloride were transported at an average solute velocity of 1.9 and 1.1 m day(-1), respectively (average linear groundwater velocity = 2.1 m day(-1)); thus, the solutes were retarded by a factor of 2.1 and 1.2 for sodium and chloride, respectively. Due to the inherent retardation of solutes into inactive pores and relatively high solute residence times, this study demonstrates the potential for wastewater polishing in ladder fens.

AB Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), conventional analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM-GC MS) were applied to lyophilized dissolved organic matter (DOM) samples taken along a small river (Oder river, Harz Mountains, Germany) draining a peatland and an adjacent spruce forest to study sources and processes that determine DOM composition. The FTIR and Py-GC MS data show that the DOM is composed predominantly of lignin derivatives and microbial/degraded carbohydrates, and that the relative proportions of the former decrease relative to the latter as the stream advances from the peatland through the forest. This can be explained by a combination of leaching of more degraded/microbial DOM from the forest soils than from the peatland, and selective co-precipitation with mineral particulate matter from the forest soils, even though increased autochthonous DOM sources (from microbial activity in the stream, for example by algae) may be involved as well. Furthermore, Py-GC MS and THM-GC MS revealed that the DOM froth the peatland outlet inherited the fingerprint of Sphagnum moss (sphagnum acid) which was progressively outweighed by guaiacyl lignin as the Odersprung advances through the coniferous forest, and that the small proportion of suberin derivatives from root-and bark-derived forest vegetation increased downstream. Py-GC MS and FTIR spectroscopy provided comparable proportions of the main biomolecular components of the DOM, whereas the apparent insensitivity of THM-GC MS to microbial carbohydrates and microbial N-containing structures (including chitin) implied bias towards the lignin derivatives. Nevertheless, the structure-resolving capacity of THM-GC MS for the phenolic DOM exceeds that of Py-GC-MS indicating that a combination of both methods, supported by FTIR, allows differentiation of DOM sources and changes throughout the flow path.

AB Streams and drains in blanket-peatland forest in western Ireland were sampled weekly over 5 years, 1996-2000, using continuous, depth-proportional. passive sampling. Analysis was for pH, alkalinity by Gran titration, anions by IC, metals by ICP, aluminium speciation by loaded-resin exchange, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by absorbance at 320 nm.
   Effects of felling are identified graphically from two forest drains whose catchments (both about 1 ha) were clearfelled, and partial clearfelling of one larger catchment (somewhat over 1 km(2)), in summer 1999. Calcium concentrations and alkalinity were increased in the drain- and streamwater from the felled areas. The pH was increased in drains, while in the larger stream, pH range decreased while the mean increased. Phosphorus increased markedly with clearfell, in the absence of recent fertilising, and also increased with fertilising; these results are reported in an accompanying paper. Ammonium-nitrogen concentrations were increased in the two drains with felling, and temporarily decreased in the larger stream. Nitrate increased in some cases. Potassium and manganese concentrations also increased. Concentrations of DOC and organic monomeric aluminium increased gradually, subject to a continuing strong annual cycle. There were no clearfelling effects on concentrations of solphate, suspended solids or inorganic monomeric aluminium. In the two drains (fully clearfelled), concentrations of sodium, chloride and magnesium, and conductivity, were all reduced after felling. Fertilising effects other than for phosphorus were indistinct.
   Effects of the combined clearfell-reforestation treatment were testable statistically, using randomised intervention analysis, between two larger streams (1 km(2)) as a treatment-control comparison. There were statistically significant positive responses in streamwater concentrations of nitrate, potassium, calcium, DOC and aluminium fractions. The implications for management practice depend on whether the loss of nutrients is sustainable for future crop productivity, and whether critical limits and loads of receiving ecosystems are exceeded.

AB The Amstel river is located in the peat-covered coastal plain of the Netherlands and gives Amsterdam its name (Amstel dam). It is a small secondary branch of the repeatedly bifurcating Rhine delta system. Historically, the Amstel debouched into the peat-fringed former Oer-IJ estuary, which was connected to the North Sea, but after the closure of this inlet the estuary was transformed into an inland sea (IJ) due to erosion of the adjacent peat. The Amstel river was active between 3000 BP and 1122 AD after which time the supply water from the Rhine was stopped due to the construction of a dam far upstream near Wijk bij Duurstede. On the basis of borehole data from various sources, four cross-sections were constructed in the Amstel branch to study the unknown lithology and lithostratigraphy of the Amstel sediments in the Amsterdam area. The deposits show the Amstel was a low-energy river which carried mainly clay. The cross-sections reveal that the Amstel in its downstream part was flanked by two lithologically identical layers of overbank clay, intercalated by a peat layer. The lowermost overbank clay was deposited from 3000 BP to about 1000 AD. The intercalated peat layer is estimated to have developed between the 11th and 12th centuries AD, indicating a decreased sediment supply in the Amstel, and rise of water level in the downstream river caused by Zuiderzee influences such as storms and tide. The uppermost overbank clay was deposited during major storm surges such as those documented in 1164 and 1170 AD, and was derived from the brackish Zuiderzee; it has been traced upstream along the Amstel for over 10 km. Near the mouth of the Amstel channel in the Oer-IJ estuary its bottom has been scoured by estuarine processes to a lower level. On the basis of archaeological and geological data it is argued that the Amstel channel of medieval Amsterdam had a water depth of about 6 m before the construction of a dam in the 13th century. Soil scientists, historical geographers and historians have argued that the Amstel once consisted of two separate rivers: a northern Oer-IJ connected channel draining from the Amsterdam Stopera to the north, and a southern peat draining channel draining from the Amsterdam-Watergraafsmeer to the south. The relatively straight stretch of the present-day Amstel now positioned within the urban area has been hypothesised to be man-made between the 11th and 13th centuries AD. In this paper, on the basis of geological arguments such as channel depths, overbank clays, peat composition and other characteristics, it is concluded that the Amstel had a natural channel in the Amsterdam area.

DT Article
DE WATER COLOR; GLACIAL LAKES; PREDICTABILITY; MODEL; GEOLOGICAL FACTORS
AB This study is an attempt to quantitatively determine variables of significance for predicting colour in small glacial lakes. Lake colour is an important variable in many lake ecological contexts. The data emanate from two extensive data-sets from Sweden, one of which concerns 1456 lakes, and the other 91 more well-suited lakes. Four year average values of lake colour were compared to catchment and morphometric parameters to help identify the processes which influence variability in colour between lakes. Various hypotheses concerning the factors regulating colour in lakes were formulated and tested. Various statistical tests were used to separate random influences from causal influences. Those ''map parameters'' with the most significant influence on colour were the theoretical lake water retention time, the percent of rocks, lakes and mires of the drainage area, the ratio between lake area and drainage area and the lake mean depth. Each model parameter provides only a limited explanation (statistical) of the variability in colour between lakes. The predictability of colour by these models can not be markedly improved by accounting for the distribution of the characteristics in the drainage area. The stability of the final model, which gives an r2-value of 0.74, has been tested with positive results. The model allows lake colour to be estimated from knowledge of ''geological'' characteristics of the lake and its drainage area. The variability between lakes from other factors, such as temperature, precipitation and/or contamination of acidifying substances and nutrients, may then be quantitatively differentiated from the impact of these ''geological'' factors.

   Rhine-Meuse delta
AB The Rhine was formed in the Miocene. During the Pleistocene it dumped large amounts of glacial debris into the subsiding North Sea Basin, which resulted in a maximum thickness of Quaternary deposits of about 1000 m. During the Holocene the present deltaic plain was formed, far inland from the lowstand deltas. The deltaic plain, which still contains glacial features, can be subdivided into a fluvial area, an estuarine area, and a coastal dune area. Sea level rise played an important role in the Holocene evolution of the deltaic plain. The abandunce of sand in the shallow North Sea basin caused progradation of the coast, once the rate of sea level rise decreased (after 5000 BP). Human influence in the delta has been great since the Middle Ages: peat was dug, lakes were drained, and new land was gained by building new dikes and draining the enclosed areas, tidal inlets were closed by dams, thus profoundly influencing hydrology and ecology. This paper provides a review of these components of the Rhine-Meuse delta in addition to potential future developments along the coastal area.

TI Impact and Productivity of Harvesting while Retaining Young Understorey
   Spruces in Final Cutting of Downy Birch
SO SILVA FENNICA

DE Betula pubescens; harvesting; logging; Picea abies; spruce releasing
ID BETULA; STANDS
AB Quite often Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karsten) forms an understorey in birch dominated stands in Finland. Advantageous growth conditions for both storeys are present especially in downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) stands on drained fertile peatland. The most common way of regenerating mature Downy birch forest is clear cutting and replanting with Norway spruce, even if vital spruce seedlings or saplings was already growing under the birch. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of retaining young understorey spruces on the productivity of harvesting and on the quality of the remaining stands in downy birch dominated stands with modern cut-to-length (CTL) machinery. Retaining undergrowth spruces decreased productivity of cutting in managed stands (600 stems/ha) by 6-9 per cent and in unmanaged stands (1200 stems/ha) by 11-17 per cent compared with clear cutting, where the understorey is not considered. Compared with the case where no understorey was present, the decrease in productivity was 10-17 per cent and 21-30 per cent respectively. In forwarding, retaining the undergrowth decreased the productivity of loading phases by 7-14 per cent. Harvesting treatment where spruces were retained produced an adequate stand structure for the future growing stock. Using this method, 14-24 per cent of the original spruces were totally destroyed while 25-44 per cent of spruces were destroyed when they were not considered for harvesting. The spatial variation of the remaining spruces was much better in the treatment where spruces were retained. Our study results shows that in this kind of two storey birch-spruce forests, the harvesting treatment where spruces are retained while cutting is the most acceptable and profitable method. It allows for a vital spruce sapling to continue growing, and avoids regeneration and tending costs or other harmful effects of clear-cut areas such as the freezing of young spruce plants and an increase in the ground water table.

AB Concern has been raised about the potential formation of acid sulfate soils and associated environmental problems related to peat extraction and, thus, peat, sediment and till characteristics of 15 well drained peat extraction fields were investigated in northern and northwestern Finland. The aim was to identify and characterize the occurrence/abundance of potential acid (hypersulfidic) and actual acid sulfate soil materials as well as metals with regards to their depositional environment (marine/non-marine), black schists and soil material properties. Sulfide-bearing marine sediments were commonly found; the highest contents and thickness of sulfide sediments were found in areas 50 m above the current sea level (a.c.s.l.), while the sulfide contents were relatively low in the mineral soil materials (mainly till) in the non-marine areas (100 m a.c.s.l.). The highest content of sulfides in sediments was typically found just below the peat layer. The sulfides existed mostly as pyrite (up to 3.5 wt% S) but were occasionally also mixed with more reactive metastable sulfide (Fe:S ratio in the order of 1:1), which coincide with high Fe concentrations, indicating that an abundance of Fe2+ can diminish the rate of pyrite formation. Sediments contained very high amounts of potential acidity, but in-field oxidation of the sediments was very limited. Although the sulfur contents were much lower (max 0.3% S), several of the till samples still became acidic (pH < 4) upon oxidation, and contained, thus, some amounts of potential acidity due to a pore buffering capacity. Consequently, during peat extraction most of the acidity is still retained in sediments limiting environmental consequences and, thus, focus should be on appropriate management to prevent oxidation and leaching after peat extraction has been finished. Locally high Mn and Zn concentrations were found in the sediments in black schist areas, indicating that Zn and Mn have migrated with the ground water from the schists to the sediment layers. In several black schist areas, the peat layer contained high amounts of sulfides with a corresponding high potential acidity as well as elevated As, Pb and Zn. This indicates an upward transport of sulfur and some metals (As, Pb and Zn) through capillary rise and/or plant uptake and/or through lateral water transport from surrounding black schist affected soil material. Air pollution, i.e. atmospheric distribution, was most likely a source for high concentrations of Cd, Hg and Sr concentrations in the peat.

AB Vast amounts of carbon are bound in both active layer and permafrost soils in the Arctic. As a consequence of climate warming, the depth of the active layer is increasing in size and permafrost soils are thawing. We hypothesize that pulses of biogenic volatile organic compounds are released from the near-surface active layer during spring, and during late summer season from thawing permafrost, while the subsequent biogeochemical processes occurring in thawed soils also lead to emissions. Biogenic volatile organic compounds are reactive gases that have both negative and positive climate forcing impacts when introduced to the Arctic atmosphere, and the knowledge of their emission magnitude and pattern is necessary to construct reliable climate models. However, it is unclear how different ecosystems and environmental factors such as drainage conditions upon permafrost thaw affect the emission and compound composition. Here we show that incubations of frozen B horizon of the active layer and permafrost soils collected from a High Arctic heath and fen release a range of biogenic volatile organic compounds upon thaw and during subsequent incubation experiments at temperatures of 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Meltwater drainage in the fen soils increased emission rates nine times, while having no effect in the drier heath soils. Emissions generally increased with temperature, and emission profiles for the fen soils were dominated by benzenoids and alkanes, while benzenoids, ketones, and alcohols dominated in heath soils. Our results emphasize that future changes affecting the drainage conditions of the Arctic tundra will have a large influence on volatile emissions from thawing permafrost soils - particularly in wetland/fen areas.

AB Export of dissolved organic carbon from lakes and streams has increased throughout Europe and North America over the past several decades. One possible cause is altered deposition chemistry; specifically, decreasing sulfate inputs leading to changes in ionic strength and dissolved organic carbon solubility. To further investigate the relationship between deposition chemistry and dissolved organic carbon export in peatlands, a field experiment was conducted to compare the pore water chemistry and peat microbial enzyme activity of mesocosms receiving sulfate amendments to mesocosms receiving no additions. To consider how peatlands respond during recovery from increased inputs of sulfate, samples were also analyzed from an area of the same peatland that was previously amended with sulfate. Current additions of sulfate decreased dissolved organic carbon concentration and increased dissolved organic carbon aromaticity. Total dissolved phosphorus decreased in response to current sulfate amendments but was elevated in the area of the peatland recovering from sulfate amendment. The total dissolved phosphorus increase, which was reflected in microbial enzyme activity, may have shifted the system from P limitation to N limitation. This shift could have important consequences for ecosystem processes related to plant and microbial communities. It also suggests that the recovery from previous sulfate amendments may take longer than may be expected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Use of biofuel ashes for the afforestation of cutaway peatlands helps to balance the content of nutrients in peat substrate, which improves the survival of planted seedlings and increases significantly bio-production. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of fertilization with alkaline ashes on the above-and belowground biomass formation of four-year-old Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and five-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands on a cutaway peatland. Five treatments were established: three mixtures with different proportions of wood ash (10-15 t ha(-1)) and oil shale ash (10-15 t ha(-1)), pure oil shale ash (10 t ha(-1)) and control (unfertilized plot). Three years after fertilization with ashes the content of phosphorus was up to 150 times and that of potassium 23 times higher in the peat substrate treated with ashes than on the control plot. The growth and biomass formation varied among treatments and depends strongly on the content of P and K in the growth substrate. The best results were observed on plots of Silver birch treated with mixed ashes; there the seedlings annual height increment was 2-3 times (first year), 5-7 times (second year) and 8-9 times (third year) greater than on the control plot. The effect of mixed ashes on the annual height increment of Scots pine was weaker: the annual height increment was 1.4 times (first year), 3 times (second year) and 5 times (third year) greater than on the control plot. The effect of pure oil shale ash on the growth and biomass formation of trees was the smallest. The greatest root collar diameter increment of birch and pine was observed on the third vegetation period. Roots formed the largest part of the total Silver birch biomass, followed by stem, branches and leaves. At the end of the third year after treatment the largest part of the biomass of Scots pine was allocated to the needles, followed by roots, stem and branches. The biomass and biomass production were the greatest on the plots treated with mixed ashes, especially on the WA15+ OSA10 and WA15+ OSA10 treatments. The total bioproductivity of birch was until 4 times intense than in the case of pine. The average current annual biomass production of Silver birch and Scots pine stands were respectively 0.17-0.21 t ha(-1) and 0.3-0.56 t ha(-1) (mixed ashes), 0.04 t ha(-1) and 0.16 t ha(-1) (OSA10) and 0.02 t ha(-1) (control).

AB A brief review of the genesis of blanket peats is presented, together with detailed analyses of basal peats from northern Scotland. Particular attention is paid to local factors affecting peat growth and the problems of sampling and interpretation arising from them. Macrofossil and loss-on-ignition analyses of four peat mineral interfaces solve many of the terminological problems of such profiles and indicate that interpretations based on field stratigraphy alone are uncertain. Pollen analyses of two profiles from contrasting microtopographic situations show well-defined vegetational change associated with early peat development. Fully organic ombrotrophic peat is present from 6805 +/- 50 BP at one site, following anthropogenic burning from c. 7500 BP and partial recovery of the open birch woodland. A change from birch woodland to Calluna heath occurs at approximately the same time on a more freely drained site with much later peat development, following further burning from 4890 +/- 65 BP. Anthropogenic activity is clearly associated with changes in soil and vegetation preceding peat formation, and the role of climatic factors remains equivocal.

AB Wildfire in the boreal forests at the Experimental Lakes Area in Ontario caused significant losses of nitrogen and phosphorus in streams.  Both watershed type and fire intensity appear to determine the extent of losses.  The Northeast wetland basin lost more N and P, especially TDN, TDP, TN, and TP, than did terrestrial basins, although nitrate losses were higher from terrestrial basins.  Losses of nutrients after the second fire generally were not as high as after the first fire.  In the East basin, which burned twice with a high fire intensity, stream concentrations of NO3-, TDN, and TN were elevated for 6 yr between the fires and remained elevated for 9 yr after the second fire.  In contrast, the Northwest basin burned with a lower intensity and had no significant increase in annual concentrations of P or most forms of N in the first 3 yr after the fire; only NO3- concentrations increased during this period.  Despite the increases in export after wildfire, net retention of TN and TP over the 18-yr period was high.  In the Northeast, East, and Northwest basins, retention of TN averaged 77, 80, and 87% compared with TP retention of 51, 67, and 84%.

AB The large boreal peatland ecosystems sequester carbon and nitrogen from the atmosphere due to a low oxygen pressure in waterlogged peat. Consequently they are sinks for CO(2) and strong emitters of CH(4). Drainage and cultivation of peatlands allows oxygen to enter the soil, which initiates decomposition of the stored organic material, and in turn CO(2) and N(2)O emissions increase while CH(4) emissions decrease. Compared to undrained pear, draining of organic soils for agricultural purposes increases the emissions of greenhouse gases (CO(2), CH(4) and N(2)O) by roughly it CO(2) equivalents/ha per year. Although farmed organic soils in most European countries represent a minor part of the total agricultural area, these soils contribute significantly to national greenhouse gas budgets. Consequently, farmed organic soils are potential targets for policy makers in search of socially acceptable and economically cost-efficient measures to mitigate climate gas emissions from agriculture. Despite a scarcity of knowledge about greenhouse gas emissions from these soils, this paper addresses the emissions and possible control of the three greenhouse gases by different managements of organic soils. More precise information is needed regarding the present trace gas fluxes from these soils, as well as predictions of future emissions under alternative management regimes, before any definite policies can be devised.

AB The ASTM standard provides guidelines for the drained direct shear test (DST) and requires the samples to be sheared at rates estimated from time to failure, tf50t50 (where t50 is the time required to achieve 50% consolidation). This paper investigates the potential of estimating the undrained strength of peat in the DST owing to its ease of accessibility and simplicity over other laboratory tests. In this experimental study, peat samples were sheared at various displacement rates at tf/t50 values of 0.065-70. The samples tested at the ASTM specified rate of tf50t50 exhibit continuous increase and decrease in shear stress and volume respectively with increasing shear strain. Hence, determining the drained strength properties of peat in the DST apparatus is complicated. However, it is concluded that the shear stress ratio, /sigma v of the DST test samples sheared at rates corresponding to tf0.2t50, reasonably corresponds to that measured in undrained direct simple shear (DSS) tests on peat, found in the literature. Therefore, DST conducted at high displacement rates will be adequate for preliminary evaluation of the shear strength of peat at close to undrained conditions, when constant volume DSS apparatus is not available.

SO FRESHWATER BIOLOGY

DE arthropods; bog; detectability; restoration
AB 1.van Duinen et al. (Freshwater Biol., 2006) raise an interesting point regarding Mazerolle et al.'s (Freshwater Biol., 2006, 51, p. 333) conclusion on the ability of invertebrates, especially sedentary species, to colonise newly created bogs pools. We wish to clarify that Mazerolle et al. (2006) targeted large arthropods and the absence of smaller sedentary species was purely a result of sampling design.
   2. van Duinen et al. (2006) postulate that colonisation rates by bog specialists should be higher in Canada than in the Netherlands, given the extensive amount of intact peatlands in Canada. Here, we emphasise the importance of taking the regional context into account when assessing restoration success as our study site occurs in a landscape where most bog pools have been drained.
   3. An evaluation of restoration efforts should focus on both sedentary and vagile invertebrates, to resolve the importance of persistence and colonisation. Such patterns are difficult to interpret, however, when sampling designs and analyses do not account for the probability of detection: an absence may be due to non-detection or true absence. We strongly urge investigators to directly estimate detection probability in addition to the parameters of interest (e.g. presence, abundance) to provide the best information possible regarding restoration success.

AB Northwestern Canada's discontinuous permafrost landscape is transitioning rapidly due to permafrost thaw, with the conversion of elevated, forested peat plateaus to low-lying, treeless wetlands. Increasing hydrological connectivity leads to partial drainage of previously-isolated bogs, which have been observed to subsequently develop hummock microtopography. However, the role of microtopographic features in the future trajectory of the transitioning landscape is unclear, including their potential controls on tree re-establishment. In order to understand the role of hummocks in landscape change, research was conducted at the Scotty Creek Research Station, Northwest Territories, to measure hummock and black spruce tree physical characteristics, and assess tree and hummock spatial coverage in peat plateaus, collapse scar bogs and the advanced transitional feature known as treed bogs. Canopy coverage in all landforms and wetland hummock areal coverage was assessed using a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) canopy gap fraction model and multispectral imagery. Hummocks, which are not underlain by permafrost but contain seasonal ice, support the establishment of black spruce trees due to favourable soil moisture conditions. Hummock flank moisture in treed bogs is intermediate between those of dry peat plateaus and inundated collapse scar bogs. Black spruce trees on peat plateaus and in treed bogs are significantly taller and of greater circumference than those in collapse scar bogs. The spatial distribution of hummocks and canopy coverage of black spruce trees in treed bogs collectively suggest that these features may play an important role in the advanced stages of permafrost thaw-driven transition of the discontinuous permafrost landscape.

AB This paper presents the creep behaviour of intact and remoulded specimens of fibrous peat obtained from a field site near Anzac, Alberta, Canada. The creep behaviour was investigated by means of long-term drained and undrained triaxial tests. The development of volumetric, axial, and undrained axial strain and strain rate during drained and undrained creep tests under variable stress conditions is presented. The stress (-) strain (-) strain rate (p'-epsilon (v)-) relationship is found to be unique for different stress and loading durations. The p'-epsilon (v)- relationship is analysed and represented by creep isotaches. The applicability of different creep models developed for normally consolidated clay is discussed and applied to define the development of creep strain in fibrous peat under varying isotropic and deviator stresses. The secondary consolidation coefficient for evaluating the volumetric strain rate of peat is found to be applicable with some limits. The drained creep behaviour of remoulded peat specimens differs from the behaviour shown by Shelby tube specimens, whereas the undrained creep behaviour in remoulded and Shelby tube specimens is similar.

AB Chronosequences and associated space-for-time substitutions are an important and fruitful means for investigating the rates and directions of soil and ecosystem evolution across multiple time-scales ranging from decades to millions of years. This paper reviews the use of chronosequences for studying biogeochemistry of paddy soil evolution to improve our understanding of the fundamental processes, the dynamic changes in soil properties and the associated environmental thresholds at different stages of paddy soil evolution under the intensive anthropogenic managements. Rice paddy cultivation results in accumulations of various nutrients (e.g. organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) over a much longer time period than predicted by typical long-term (<50 years) field experiments, although it is not clear how long it takes paddy soils with different origins to reach a steady-state of these important nutrients. Extensive investigations of a 2000-year paddy soil chronosequence derived from calcareous marine sediments in the coastal region of Zhejiang Province (P.R. China) illustrate three phases of paddy soil evolution and the associated pedogenic thresholds: an initial phase during the first few decades dominated by rapid desalinization, loss of magnetic susceptibility, accumulation of topsoil organic matter and formation of a compacted plow pan due to extrinsic thresholds resulting from anthropogenic activities; the second phase lasts several centuries comprising Fe and clay enrichment in the illuvial horizon, and the loss of phosphorus and Mn coincident with the near complete removal of CaCO3 (recognized as the intrinsic threshold); in the third phase (>700 years), (trans-)formation and redistribution of metal oxides are accompanied by clearly visible hydromorphic patterns in paddy subsoils. We also note that after 2000-years, paddy soils still lack evidence of silicate weathering and neo-formation of pedogenic clay minerals. Paddy soil management is adjusted to match landscape positions (e.g. well-drained sloping uplands, alluvial plains with groundwater fluctuation, and poorly drained bog areas with near surface water table) and this influences the trajectory and magnitude of pedogenic changes with prolonged rice cultivation. However, the parent material effects on paddy soil evolution seem to diminish with the lapse of time and vary considerably among different soil properties or processes. Given our universal dependence on paddy soils for food production, their value as an excellent opportunity for investigating anthropedogenesis, and their critical roles in global biogeochemical cycling, we put forward several open questions that must be resolved to maintain the millennial-scale sustainability of these important wetlands.

AB Small boreal lakes emit large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Yet emissions of these greenhouse gases are variable in space and time, in part due to variable within-lake CO2 and CH4 concentrations. To determine the extent and the underlying drivers of this variation, we measured lake water CO2 and CH4 concentrations and estimated associated emissions using spatially discrete water samples collected every 2 weeks from a small boreal lake. On select dates, we also collected groundwater samples from the surrounding catchment. On average, groundwater draining a connected peat mire complex had significantly higher CO2 and CH4 concentrations compared to waters draining forest on mineral soils. However, within the lake, only CH4 concentrations nearshore from the mire complex were significantly elevated. We observed little spatial variability in surface water CO2; however, bottom water CO2 in the pelagic zone was significantly higher than bottom waters at nearshore locations. Overall, temperature, precipitation, and thermal stratification explained temporal patterns of CO2 concentration, whereas hydrology (discharge and precipitation) best predicted the variation in CH4 concentration. Consistent with these different controls, the highest CO2 emission was related to lake turnover at the end of August while the highest CH4 emission was associated with precipitation events at the end of June. These results suggest that annual carbon emissions from small boreal lakes are influenced by temporal variation in weather conditions that regulate thermal stratification and trigger hydrologic land-water connections that supply gases from catchment soils to the lake.

AB Boreal mire landscapes are rich in soil carbon and significantly contribute to the carbon input of aquatic ecosystems. They are composed of different mesoscale ecohydrological subunits, whose individual contributions to the water and carbon export of mire catchments are not well understood. The spring snowmelt period is the major hydrological event in the annual water cycle of the boreal regions and strongly influences the carbon flux between the terrestrial and aquatic systems. The aim of this study was (1) to provide a conceptual understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the surface water chemistry along a swamp forest-fen-bog gradient during the snowmelt period, (2) to quantify the exported dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in the runoff and (3) to identify the ecohydrological landscape unit that contributes most to DOC export during the snowmelt period in a heterogeneous mire complex in Northwest Russia. The highest DOC concentrations were detected in the swamp forest, and the lowest concentrations were observed at the treeless bog by the end of the snowmelt period (swamp forest: 37-43 mg l(-1), bog: 13-17 mg l(-1)). During the spring snowmelt period, a significant amount (similar to 1.7 g Cm-2) of DOC was transferred by the similar to 74 mm of runoff from the catchment into the river. Variability in the thawing periods led to differences in the relative contributions of each ecohydrological zone to the carbon export measured at a stream channel draining the studied part of the mire complex. An increased understanding of the variation in DOC concentrations and contributions from the mesoscale ecohydrological subunits to carbon export can help to predict the potential regional loss of DOC based on land cover type under climate change.

AB The analyses of 248 samples have revealed that the composition and distribution patterns of sediments within the Albemarle estuarine system (AES) represent a complex interaction between multiple sediment sources, basin morphology and evolution, and associated estuarine processes. Three sediment end-member types are dominant: sand, peat, and organic-rich mud (ORM). Throughout the AES, shallow perimeter platforms and associated sediment-bank shorelines are eroded into Pleistocene units. Shoreline recession supplies sand to the platforms and mud to the central basins; these sediments mix with suspended sediment from the fluvial drainages. Swamp forest-peat and marsh-peat shorelines are actively eroding and supply fine organic detritus to produce the dominant ORM sediment in the central basins. Perimeter platform sands grade into ORM on the platform slope. ORM constitutes about 70% of the benthic habitats within the AES and has an average composition of 76.2% inorganic mud, 13.1% sand, and 10.7% organic matter. The characteristics of ORM greatly affect the benthic community structure, chemical quality of the sediments, and the water quality of the estuary. ORM readily moves in and out of the water column in response to natural and anthropogenic activities, affecting water column turbidity and trace and major element geochemistry. Organic matter and clay minerals in ORM are chemically reactive and interact with the water column to adsorb or release contaminants, nutrients, and gases. Thus, ORM acts as both a sink and source for many different chemical constituents in the water column and plays important, but poorly understood, functions in the physical and chemical dynamics of estuarine ecosystems.

AB Floristic composition and vegetation succession were studied in relation to abiotic factors on secondarily developed young floating islands. These had formed after the reflooding of a drained wetland where mature floating fens had been present. We selected two floating fen Kis-Balaton Hungary complexes with similar physiognomy as references and performed stratified sampling with strata distinguished according to species dominance in all three sites. Species cover was estimated in 5 m x 5 m quadrats and the resulting data set was analysed with correspondence analysis. Interstitial (ground)water and soil parameters were measured and vegetation composition were recorded subsequently on the site in Kis-Balaton. Results were evaluated with canonical correspondence analysis including forward selection to test for significant abiotic variables: plots formed three main groups in the ordination space. One group contained ruderal vegetation, while the other ones were characterised by sedges and willows respectively. According to the forward selection, available nitrogen content of the soil was responsible for the segregation of the ruderal group from willow scrubs. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The U.K. has extensive databases on soils, land cover and historic land use change which have made it possible to construct a comprehensive inventory of the principal terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon for approximately the year 1990, using methods that are consistent with, and at least as accurate as, the revised 1996 guidelines recommended by IPCC where available - and including categories which are not currently considered under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This country inventory highlights issues concerning methodology, uncertainty, double counting, the importance of soils and the relative magnitude of sources and sinks which are reported to the UNFCCC relative to other sources and sinks.
   The carbon sinks (negative values in MtC a(-1)) for categories reported to the UNFCCC, based on the IPCC categories, were estimated to be: forest trees and litter (-2.1), U.K. forest products (-0.5, ignoring imports and exports), non-forest biomass (-0.3), forest soils (-0.1) and soils on set-aside land (-0.4). The carbon sources (positive values) reported under the UNFCCC were estimated to be: losses of soil organic carbon resulting from cultivation of semi-natural land (6.2) and from urbanization (1.6), drainage of peatlands (0.3) and fenlands (0.5), and peat extraction (0.2). A range of other sources and sinks not covered by the IPCC guidelines were also quantified, namely, the accumulation of carbon in undrained peatlands (-0.7, ignoring methane emission), sediment accretion in coastal marshes (-0.1), the possible U.K. share of the CO2 and N fertilization carbon sink (-2.0) and riverine organic and particulate carbon export to the sea (1.4, which may be assumed to be a source if most of this carbon is released as CO2 in the sea). All sinks totalled -6.2 and sources 10.2, giving a net flux to the atmosphere in 1990 of 4.0 MtC a(-)1. Uncertainties associated with categories, mostly based on best guesses, ranged from +/-15% for forest biomass and litter to +/-60% for CO2 and N fertilization.

TI Hydrogeomorphic and compositional variation among red maple (Acer
   rubrum) wetlands in southeastern Massachusetts
SO NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
AB Sixteen Acer rubrum (red maple)-dominated wetlands in three hydrogeomorphic settings (depressional, riverine, seepage slope) were sampled in southeastern Massachusetts. Quantitative data of vegetation from five strata were compared with soil-chemistry measurements using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to determine if hydrogeomorphic (HGM) setting was related to species composition. Although all sampled wetlands were dominated or co-dominated by red maple, DCA-differentiated stands according to HGM setting, i.e., riverine flood-plain wetlands separated from depressional (kettle) wetlands and slope wetlands on the DCA ordination. Further, species richness was lowest in depressional wetlands and highest in riverine wetlands, reflecting differences in soil chemistry and soil type, ultimately determined by hydrogeomorphic setting. Depressional swamps overwhelmingly dominated by red maple and those with Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic white cedar [AWC]) were very similar in understory composition, soil chemistry and type, and ordination position, suggesting that many of the red maple depressions were probably once AWC swamps. Post-colonial forest-management practices such as repeated cutting of stands, fire suppression, draining for conversion to cranberry bog, and subsequent abandonment have degraded and fragmented AWC swamps throughout southeastern Massachusetts and extensively reduced their areal extent. However, recent abandonments of cranberry bogs have provided opportunities for restoring AWC wetlands to a portion of their original habitat.

AB Questions: What vegetation changes occurred over three decades on two large temperate peatlands (1115 ha) isolated in an agricultural landscape and affected by a human-ignited fire?
   Location: Southwest Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: In 2012, we revisited 103 plots first sampled in 1984-85. Changes in species composition were evaluated using the Sorensen dissimilarity index, in species frequency with Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests, and in species cover using one-sample t-tests. Tree encroachment was evaluated using aerial photographs and satellite imagery. We used linear discriminant analyses (LDA) and ANOVA to evaluate the impact of tree encroachment on species composition.
   Results: We found a floristic dissimilarity of 35% between 1984 and 1985 and 2012. Most species whose frequency and mean cover increased were peatland species, while most species with lower frequency and mean cover in 2012 were non-peatland species. The total area occupied by forest increased from 26% to 51%, an overall gain of 280 ha of forest. The species composition of old and new forests as well as of open sectors was highly distinct, as shown by the LDA that correctly assigned 97% of the sampling plots to these groups. Non-peatland species were 15 and five timesmore abundant than peatland species in old and new forests than open habitats, respectively.
   Conclusions: Gradual drying of the peatland margins due to drainage of the surrounding catchment, as well as post-fire succession are likely the main drivers of the changes observed. Overall, our study showed that peatlands isolated in an anthropogenic landscape are dynamic ecosystems where vegetation communities can experience substantial changes in a short time frame. The broader implication is that peatland conservation in highly modified landscapes must be linked to restoration.

AB Many north-hemispherical mires seemingly untouched by drainage and cultivation are influenced by a diffuse sum of man-made environmental changes, such as atmospherical nitrogen deposition that mask general patterns in species richness and functional group responses along resource gradients. To obtain insights into natural diversity-environment relationships, we studied the vegetation and the peat chemistry of pristine bog ecosystems in southern Patagonia along a west-east transect across the Andes. The studied bog ecosystems covered a floristic gradient from hyperoceanic blanket bogs dominated by cushion building vascular plants via a transitional mixed type to Sphagnum-dominated raised bogs east of the mountain range. To test the influence of resource availability on diversity patterns, species richness and functional groups were related to environmental variables by calculating general regression models and generalized additive models. Species richness showed strong linear correlations to peat chemical features and the general regression model resulted in three major environmental variables (water level, total nitrogen, NH(4)Cl soluble calcium), altogether explaining 76% of variance. Functional group response illustrated a clear separation along environmental gradients. Mosses dominated at the low end of a nitrogen gradient, whereas cushion plants had their optimum at intermediate levels, and graminoids dominated at high nitrogen contents. Further shifts were related to NH(4)Cl soluble calcium and water level. The models documented partly non-linear relationships between functional group response and trophical peat properties. Within the three bog types, the calculated models differed remarkably illustrating the scale-dependency of the explanatory factors. Our findings confirmed several general patterns of species richness and functional shifts along resource gradients in a surprisingly clear way and underpin the significance of undisturbed peatlands as reference systems for testing of ecological theory and for conservation and ecological restoration in landscapes with strong human impact.

AB Ground- and surface-water-fed peatlands (i.e., fens) of temperate Europe face high anthropogenic nutrient loads from atmospheric deposition, agricultural catchment areas, and from peat decomposition, if drained. As a result, nitrogen loads may exceed a fen's natural nutrient removal capacity, leading to increased eutrophication of adjacent water bodies. Therefore, it is important to address possible means to decrease a fen's nutrient load, including nutrient uptake by fen plants. To assess how much fen plants can contribute to nutrient removal by uptake, nutrient stocks of above- and below-ground biomass need to be quantified. Therefore, we investigated nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium uptake capacities of sedges (Carex species), which are common dominants in fen plant communities. We grew specimens of five Carex species with varying preferences in nutrient availability under controlled, different nutrient levels. We show that Carex above-ground biomass harvest can remove up to one third of a system's total nitrogen even at high loads of about 40 g nitrogen m & minus;2. Species-specific differences in biomass production, rather than preferences in nutrient availability under natural conditions, were drivers of standing nutrient stocks: Highly productive species, i.e., C. acutiformis and C. rostrata, had highest nutrient standing stocks across all nutrient levels. Amounts of nutrients stored in shoots increased almost linearly with increasing nutrient levels, whereas below-ground nutrient stocks species-specifically increased, saturated, or decreased, with increasing nutrient levels. As a rough estimate, depending on the species, 6 & ndash;16 cycles of an-nual above-ground harvest would suffice to decrease nitrogen concentrations from the highest to the lowest level used in this study. Overall, our results indicate that Carex biomass harvest can be an efficient means to coun-teract anthropogenic nitrogen eutrophication in fens.

AB Relatively minor amounts of manganese (Mn) were lost in drainage waters from peat, ground Pinus radiata bark and eucalypt sawdust-based potting media, and Mn added via two oxides, two soils or MnSO4 under conditions typical of those in nurseries. Losses were more substantial from these media after they had been heated at 110-degrees-C for 1 hour. The 10 mg kg-1 of native Mn in a Pinus radiata bark medium was sufficient for normal growth of Hebe 'Inspiration' and New Zealand Cape oats for 16 months. However, the 4.6-5.8 mg kg-1 of native Mn in peat and sawdust-based media was insufficient for 12 months of symptom-free growth. Amendment of the peat and sawdust media with 20 mg kg-1 Mn, as MnSO4, allowed normal growth for 16 months. DTPA and EDTA were better able to assess plant-available Mn in the media than were Double Acid, 0.5 M NH4OAc (pH 4.65), 0.5 M Ca(NO3)2 or 0.5 M Mg(NO3)2. A 1:1.5 (v/v) 2 mM DTPA extract of these soil-less media at planting had to contain at least 1.6 mg l-1 Mn to ensure an adequate supply for 12 months of normal growth of the test plants. Caution is needed in extrapolating these data to other media and plants.

AB The results of studies on the improvement of technology for producing high-quality planting material of half-high blueberry and Arctic bramble by the method of clonal micropropagation are presented in the current paper. Creation of forest berry plantations in peat extraction areas allows reducing environmental damage and significantly increasing the efficiency of the timber industry. In recent decades, there has been an increasing interest in the creation of forest berry plantations on drained and cutover peatlands in Russia and other countries. It is necessary to use varietal planting material for the successful cultivation of forest berry plants on an industrial scale. Clonal micropropagation is the most effective of the vegetative methods for obtaining planting material, which allows receiving a huge amount of healthy planting material all year round in the conditions of a small laboratory area. Chloride-free ecosterilizer and bleaching agent based on sodium hypochlorite "Belizna" with an exposure of 15 and 20 min showed high efficiency in sterilization of explants of half-high blueberry and Arctic bramble. The highest viability of explants of the studied forest berry crops was observed when sterilized with a 0.1 % mercuric chloride solution and 15 min exposure, and its sharp decrease at 20 min exposure. At the stage of micropropagation, with an increase in the concentration of cytokinin 6-BAP from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L on the nutrient Woody Plant Medium the number of shoots in regenerated plants of half-high blueberry (Northcountry and Northblue cultivars) and Arctic bramble (Anna and Sofia cultivars) increased. The effect of the concentration of IBA-derived auxin on the number and length of roots of regenerated plants was observed at thein vitro rooting stage.

SO HYDROBIOLOGIA

DT Article
DE FEN VEGETATION; SUCCESSION; WATER CYCLE; BASE STATE; NUTRIENT STATE;
   CONSERVATION
AB A survey of base-rich wetlands in The Netherlands is presented. The main area of their occurrence is the low-lying Holocene part of the country, until some thousand years ago a large and coherent wetland landscape: the Holland wetland. The development of various parts of the Holland wetland into marshes, fens and bogs can be understood from hydrological relations in mire basins, as recognized in the distinction of primary, secondary and tertiary mire basin stages. Presently, the remnants of the Holland wetland are separate base-rich wetlands. The succession of their vegetation reflects various abiotic conditions and human influences. Three main developmental periods are distinguished as regards these factors. The first, geological period of mire development is seen as a post-glacial relaxation, with the inertia due to the considerable mass of wetland as a stabilizing factor. Biological ''grazing'' influences, as an aspect of utilization by humans, converted base-rich wetlands to whole new types in the second, historical period. Presently, mass and harvesting have decreased in importance, and actual successions in terrestrializing turbaries seem to reflect rapidly changing environmental conditions. Human control could well become the most important factor in the future development of wetland nature. The present value of open fen vegetation strongly depends on the continuation of the historical harvesting. The development of wooded fen may help to increase the mass of wetland in the future. Best results in terms of biodiversity are expected when their base state is maintained through water management.
   The vegetation and hydrology of floating fens in terrestrializing turbaries is treated in some more detail. Various lines and phases in the succession are distinguished. Open fen vegetation at base-rich, yet nutrient-poor sites is very rich in species threatened elsewhere. The fast acidification of certain such fens is attributed to hydrological and management factors. This acidification is illustrated in the profile of a floating raft sample. At the scale of these small fens, the elemental structure comprising base-rich fen, transitional fen and bog vegetation, is not as stable as it was in the large Holland wetland. A critical role seems to be played by the supply of bases with the water influx. The changing base state is supposed to change the nutrient cycling to such an extent that it would be correct to call this trophic excitation of the ecosystem, rather than just eutrophication. Eutrophication indicates a quantitative reaction to an increased nutrient supply, the internal system being unaltered. The drainage of fens, resulting in an increased productivity of the vegetation, provides another example of excitation, to the effect that the functional system is dramatically changed internally.

AB Sulphur forms were determined at two peatland sites in Scotland, each having both open bog vegetation and afforested areas. Afforestation activity (including initial ploughing and, in one case, active drainage) had a significant effect on peat physical characteristics, depending on the depth sampled, but had less influence on S chemistry. There was no significant difference in mean total S concentration (mean of 0.24% over the upper 100 cm peat) between the two sites or between the afforested and open areas. Organic S was dominant with approximately 64% of the total S being C-bonded S and 27% ester sulphate S. Reduced inorganic forms (acid volatile S, elemental S and Cr-reducible S) accounted for approximately 8% of the total S. On average, only half of the Cr-reducible S could be accounted for by pyrite S as determined by analysis of the Fe; the remainder was considered to be an organic S fraction. The presence of both S-oxidizing thiobacilli and sulphate-reducing bacteria were indicative of an active oxidation/reduction cycle that resulted in the accumulation of S at or below the mean water table. The results are discussed in terms of S retention and alkalinity generation in peatlands.

ID ATMOSPHERIC CO2; BALANCE; PEATLANDS; BOG
AB Boreal forests and wetlands are thought to be significant carbon sinks, and they could become net C sources as the Earth warms. Most of the C of boreal forest ecosystems is stored in the moss layer and in the soil. The objective of this study was to estimate soil C stocks (including moss layers) and rates of accumulation and loss for a 733 km(2) area of the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study site in northern Manitoba, using data from smaller-scale intensive field studies. A simple process-based model developed from measurements of soil C inventories and radiocarbon was used to relate soil C storage and dynamics to soil drainage and forest stand age. Soil C stocks covary with soil drainage class, with the largest C stocks occurring in poorly drained sites. Estimated rates of soil C accumulation or loss are sensitive to the estimated decomposition constants for the large pool of deep soil C, and improved understanding of deep soil C decomposition is needed. While the upper moss layers regrow and accumulate C after fires, the deep C dynamics vary across the landscape, from a small net sink to a significant source. Estimated net soil C accumulation, averaged for the entire 733 km(2) area, was 20 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (28 g C m(-2) yr(-1) accumulation in surface mosses offset by 8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) lost from deep C pools) in a year with no fire. Most of the C accumulated in poorly and very poorly drained soils (peatlands and wetlands). Burning of the moss layer in only 1% of uplands would offset the C stored in the remaining 99% of the area. Significant interannual variability in C storage is expected because of the irregular occurrence of fire in space and time. The effects of climate change and management on fire frequency and on decomposition of immense deep soil C stocks are key to understanding future C budgets in boreal forests.

AB In this paper, we assess the extent to which the export of terrestrially fixed carbon to aquatic systems and the aquatic metabolism of this carbon affect the overall accumulation of organic carbon in a boreal catchment. We estimated the contribution of stocks and processes in aquatic environments to the carbon balance of a boreal catchment in northern Sweden. We used published data concerning the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in terrestrial environments, and calculations of loss of terrestrial carbon to surface water and the turnover of terrestrial carbon in aquatic systems. The NEE of terrestrial environments was estimated to be 139 gC/m(2) of catchment area per year. The export of terrestrially fixed carbon to aquatic systems was 8.6 g C/m(2)/yr, resulting in a net accumutation of organic carbon in terrestrial systems of 131 g C/m(2) /yr. Almost 45% of the terrestrial export was mineralized in streams and takes and evaded as CO2, while most of the remaining (approximately 55%) terrestrial export was transported to the sea as organic carbon or as dissolved inorganic carbon emanating from soil respiration. The sedimentation of organic carbon and input of organic carbon via aquatic primary production were insignificant when compared to the mineralization and river transport of terrestrial organic carbon. Aquatic fluxes were small compared to the terrestrial NEE, which we consider to be largely a consequence of the studied catchment being subject to intensive forestry resulting in a large annual accumulation of carbon in growing tree biomass.

AB Land cover changes can impact the climate by influencing the surface energy and water balance. Naturally treeless or sparsely treed peatlands were extensively drained to stimulate forest growth in Finland over the second half of 20th century. The aim of this study is to investigate the biogeophysical effects of peatland forestation on regional climate in Finland. Two sets of 18-year climate simulations were done with the regional climate model REMO by using land cover data based on pre-drainage (1920s) and post-drainage (2000s) Finnish national forest inventories. In the most intensive peatland forestation area, located in the middle west of Finland, the results show a warming in April of up to 0.43K in monthly-averaged daily mean 2m air temperature, whereas a slight cooling from May to October of less than 0.1K in general is found. Consequently, snow clearance days over that area are advanced up to 5 days in the mean of 15 years. No clear signal is found for precipitation. Through analysing the simulated temperature and energy balance terms, as well as snow depth over five selected subregions, a positive feedback induced by peatland forestation is found between decreased surface albedo and increased surface air temperature in the snow-melting period. Our modelled results show good qualitative agreements with the observational data. In general, decreased surface albedo in the snow-melting period and increased evapotranspiration in the growing period are the most important biogeophysical aspects induced by peatland forestation that cause changes in climate. The results from this study can be further integrally analysed with biogeochemical effects of peatland forestation to provide background information for adapting future forest management to mitigate climate warming effects. Moreover, they provide insights about the impacts of projected forestation of tundra at high latitudes due to climate change.

AB Human activity is apart from climatic changes the main factor threatening swampy grounds all over the world. The basic hazards are drainage treatments and exploitation of peat deposits. In particular, sensible environments, such as undoubtedly bogs especially raised bogs are endangered to negative human activity. The main components of these ecosystems are stenobiont plants, what influences to a high degree their susceptibility to degradation. Even inconsiderable changes in deposit hydrology cause considerable changes in composition and structure of plant communities. These changes in turn cause disturbances of peat forming processes. That is why there is very important for the areas undergoing strong anthropopressure to carry out scientific investigations concerning many aspects of functioning of these precious ecosystems.
   The aim of the work was estimation peat-forming process on one of peat-bog in the Orawsko-Nowotarska Valley. The investigations with use of the method proposed by Rochefort et al. [1997] were carried out on the Baligowka Peat-Bog. On the examined object the highest mean cover is characterized by vascular plants - 49,9%, a little less peatmoss - 46,76%. The lowest area occupy so called remaining mosses, only 2,28%. The investigations showed high differences in peat forming process course in 3 distinguished investigation zones. The lowest cover degree by the most important plant group - peatmoss had post exploitation zone (31,28%). The best conditions for development of peat-forming plants predominant in the central part of the dome, which kept the natural character.

AB Peat plateaus are widespread at high northern latitudes and are important soil organic carbon reservoirs. A warming climate can cause either increased ground subsidence (thermokarst) resulting in lake formation or increased drainage as the permafrost thaws. A better understanding of spatiotemporal variations in these landforms in relation to climate change is important for predicting the future thawing permafrost carbon feedback. In this study, dynamics in thermokarst lake extent during the last 35-50 years has been quantified through time series analysis of aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite images (IKONOS/QuickBird) in three peat plateau complexes, spread out across the northern circumpolar region along a climatic and permafrost gradient. From the mid-1970s until the mid-2000s there has been an increase in mean annual air temperature, winter precipitation, and ground temperature in all three study areas. The two peat plateaus located in the continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones, respectively, where mean annual air temperatures are below -5 degrees C and ground temperatures are -2 degrees C or colder, have experienced small changes in thermokarst lake extent. In the peat plateau located in the sporadic permafrost zone where the mean annual air temperature is around -3 degrees C, and the ground temperature is close to 0 degrees C, lake drainage and infilling with fen vegetation has been extensive and many new thermokarst lakes have formed. In a future progressively warmer and wetter climate permafrost degradation can cause significant impacts on landscape composition and greenhouse gas exchange also in areas with extensive peat plateaus, which presently still experience stable permafrost conditions.

AB 1 Records of Empetrum nigrum pollen from blanket peat profiles at 18 sites in the southern Pennines, covering a variety of topographic situations, were collated. Inferences were drawn from the pollen database about climatic change over the last 3000 years and the time of onset of gully erosion of the peats.
   2 Interpretations of the pollen record were based on observations of the present-day distribution of E. nigrum in British blanket mires, and on studies by surface-sample analysis of its pollen production and dispersal at a North Wales bog. Empetrum favours better-drained situations such as hummocks and gully sides, and its pollen is dispersed only over short distances. Pollen was found in quantity only at one hummock site.
   3 Two episodes of high Empetrum pollen were found consistently in the peat profiles: prior to about 860 BC, and between c. AD 1100 and 1250. These episodes were interpreted as the product of extended periods of drier climate, At sites exhibiting severe gully erosion at the present day, high Empetrum pollen values have been maintained subsequent to AD 1250; sites along the middle and upper reaches of erosion gullies, however, show high values only within the last 200-250 years.
   4 Because of the sensitivity of the southern Pennine bog vegetation to climatic change, the stratigraphic record of Sphagnum and Racomitrium, macrofossils, in combination with the Empetrum urn pollen record, call be used to provide a framework of climatic change in the region over the last 3000 years.

AB The extent of drainage impact was studied in five transitional mires along a hydrosequence. The principal environmental variables driven by drainage are the minimum water level in the peat layer, together with the dry matter and total-N contents of peat. The drawdown effect of a cutoff ditch (intercepting surface and subsurface flow) on the minimum water level extends to a distance of 250-320 m. Peat water levels above -50 cm are associated with a sharp increase in Sphagnum cover, and the percentage of bog-specific species increases markedly when the minimum water level is higher than -25 cm. The girths and heights of trees and canopy closure of the tree layer decrease rapidly up to a distance of 200 m from the cutoff ditch. Negative impacts of the cutoff ditch on the canopy cover and average height of trees, estimated using LIDAR data, can be followed for distances up to 400 m and 350 m, respectively. The density and height of shrub stems start to increase at a distance of 16 m and continue to increase up to 400 m from the cutoff ditch. The percentage of bog-specific species increases up to a distance of 100 m, whilst the percentage of fen-specific species begins to decrease remarkably at a distance of about 200 m from the cutoff ditch.

AB Water from 24 Swedish and Finnish rivers running to the Gulf of Bothnia (comprising the Bothnian Sea and Bothnian Bay) was sampled on five occasions in 1991-93, and analysed for concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), humic substances and metals (Fe, Al, Cu, Zn). in general, TOC is higher in the Finnish rivers, which drain forest and peatlands, than in the Swedish rivers, which drain vast mountainous and forested areas. The pH is slightly lower in the Finnish rivers. Humic substances comprise approximately 80% of the total amount of organic matter. Calculations of the specific transport of organic matter (i.e. the total transport per catchment area) showed that the average release from the Finnish catchments is more than twice the release 14 om the Swedish catchments. Fe and Al exhibit the same concentration pattern as TOC. To estimate the humic fraction of some metals (Fe, Cu and Zn), a speciation study, utilizing a weak anion-exchange resin, was performed on water from rivers with different hydrochemical properties. The humic fractions of Fe, Cu and Zn were 20-40, 40-60 and <10%, respectively, of the total metal content. The total load to the Gulf of Bothnia of humic substances and Fe, Cu and Zn associated with the humic matter was calculated. It was found that the discharge of humic substances to Bothnian Bay originates primarily from the Finnish rivers, and the largest amounts contributed to the Bothnian Sea come from the Swedish rivers.

AB Peat specific yield (S-Y) is an important parameter involved in many peatland hydrological functions such as flood attenuation, baseflow contribution to rivers, and maintaining groundwater levels in surficial aquifers. However, general knowledge on peatland water storage capacity is still very limited, due in part to the technical difficulties related to in situ measurements. The objectives of this study were to quantify vertical S-Y variations of water tables in peatlands using the water table fluctuation (WTF) method and to better understand the factors controlling peatland water storage capacity. The method was tested in five ombrotrophic peatlands located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). In each peatland, water table wells were installed at three locations (up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient). Near each well, a 1-m long peat core (8 cm x 8 cm) was sampled, and subsamples were used to determine S-Y with standard gravitational drainage method. A larger peat sample (25 cm x 60 cm x 40 cm) was also collected in one peatland to estimate S-Y using a laboratory drainage method. In all sites, the mean water table depth ranged from 9 to 49 cm below the peat surface, with annual fluctuations varying between 15 and 29 cm for all locations. The WTF method produced similar results to the gravitational drainage experiments, with values ranging between 0.13 and 0.99 for the WTF method and between 0.01 and 0.95 for the gravitational drainage experiments. S-Y was found to rapidly decrease with depth within 20 cm, independently of the within-site location and the mean annual water table depth. Dominant factors explaining S-Y variations were identified using analysis of variance. The most important factor was peatland site, followed by peat depth and seasonality. Variations in storage capacity considering site and seasonality followed regional effective growing degree days and evapotranspiration patterns. This work provides new data on spatial variations of peatland water storage capacity using an easily implemented method that requires only water table measurements and precipitation data.

AB Plant growth forms can influence carbon cycling, particularly in carbon-rich ecosystems like northern peatlands; however, mechanistic evidence of this relationship is limited. Our aim was to determine if northern peatland plant growth forms alter belowground dissolved carbon chemistry and enhance carbon release through stimulated microbial metabolism.
   We used replicated, peat monoliths populated exclusively by Sphagnum mosses, graminoids, or bare peat and quantified changes in belowground dissolved organic carbon chemistry, microbial metabolism, as well as respired CO2.
   The graminoid growth form was significantly distinct in belowground dissolved organic carbon chemistry with carbon compound lability 20 % and 11 % greater than bare peat and Sphagnum moss respectively. The labile dissolved organic carbon stimulated the microbial community, as indicated by greater microbial metabolic activity and richness values in conjunction with 50 % higher respired CO2 fluxes under the graminoid treatment.
   Our results provide mechanistic evidence that peatland plant growth forms can drive carbon cycling processes by altering dissolved organic carbon chemistry to prompt cascading effects on the microbial community and carbon release - trends suggestive of microbial priming effects. Should climate change increase graminoid prevalence at the expense of Sphagnum moss northern peatland carbon store stability may be threatened by this mechanism.

AB For geological and environmental research in an arid area, a unique advantage of, radar remote sensing is that radar wave can penetrate a certain layer of dry sand (a few centimeters to meters thick) to reach the buried bedrock. The penetration capability is able to reveal the subsurface geological structure and old drainage paths. Based on the analysis of SIR-A, SIR-B, SIR-C, Radarsat ScanSAR, Landsat MSS and Landsat TM images acquired on different dates and the investigations made in several field trips in Alxa Plateau of Inner Mongolia; a number of old river valley and lake basins buried by wind-blown sand mire recognized. Two parallel old drainage systems in the north and middle of the study area are delineated. The study suggests that the moving sand belts mainly follow the old drainage courses. This study also establishes a preliminary drainage evolution model for an area of about 300 000 km(2) since the Tertiary and finds that the Alxa Plateau was once an area with many rivers and lakes with a warm and humid climate. The relief reversion caused by neotectonic movement, since "Qinghai-Tibet movement" is also analyzed.

AB Measurement of the groundwater flux and the consequent advection of dissolved carbon (DOC (dissolved organic carbon), CH4 and CO2) were made in a boreal peatland in northern Sweden in summer 1993. The early summer gradients in hydraulic head indicated a downward flux of water in the peatland, but after a persistent mid-summer dry period the gradients changed to produce an outward radial flow from the centre to the mar ins of the peatland, This shift in gradients corresponded to the removal of some of CH4 and CO2 dissolved in groundwater. The concentrations of dissolved CH4 and CO2 were, spatially variable, with the highest observed in the centre of the peatland. In contrast, DOC concentrations were relatively constant near the centre of the peatland and switched in the margin from being the highest during dry periods to lowest during wet periods. The changes in concentration of CH4, CO2, and DOC are a function of the seasonal patterns of production and consumption, but groundwater Row is significant in the redistribution of dissolved carbon and the spatial patterns of concentration. The calculated mass flux of dissolved carbon was significant: it was approximately 20% of annual CO2 fixation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Mikulagkova E., Fajmonova Z. & Hajek M. (2012): Invasion of central-European habitats by the moss Campylopus introflexus. - Preslia 84: 863-886. Although invasions by vascular plants are frequently studied, little is known about invasive bryophytes. Campylopus introflexus is an invasive moss endangering natural vegetation in western Europe and currently extending its secondary area eastwards. Therefore, we studied its ecology in the Czech Republic (central Europe). We updated its distribution, described colonized habitats in term of the composition Of the vegetation, investigated substrate and water demands and which habitats in the Czech Republic are potentially at risk of invasion by C. introflexus. The first dataset contained 78 vegetation plots with C. introflexus from across the whole of the area investigated and included all the habitats colonized. The second dataset contained results of previous studies of the vegetation of pine forests both with and without C. introflexus and was used to determine the fine scale features of its habitat preferences within this habitat. Records of the vegetation plots in both datasets were numerically classified. We further calculated the similarity of the species composition of vegetation plots with C. introflexus with that of 26,998 vegetation plots without C. introflexus that were stored in a large database in order to predict the habitats that were likely to be colonized. Ecological demands were characterized by in situ research (soil samples from 52 vegetation plots) and ecological interpretation of the pine forest dataset. Further, a cultivation experiment was established with populations from 20 of the sites studied in order to test the ability of C. introflexus to grow in different soil and moisture conditions, and the data were evaluated by linear mixed effect models. We found that C. introflexus invades dry, nutrient poor acidic soils in a range of vegetation types, and is most common in coniferous forest plantations and drained bogs, where it colonizes open patches resulting from anthropogenic disturbance where there is little competition from other plants. The vegetation plots from the database that were similar in species composition to those with C. introflexus are mainly forest habitats broadly distributed in the Czech Republic. Cultivation experiments showed that this species does badly when growing in lime-rich or waterlogged soils. We conclude that the species has the potential to be common in central Europe because of the wide range of habitats with favourable vegetation compositions and ecological parameters. However, it presently represents no risk for endangered plant species and communities.

AB The boreal landscape is a complex, spatio-temporally varying mosaic of forest and mire landscape elements that control surface water hydrology and chemistry. Here, we assess long-term water quality time series from three nested headwater streams draining upland forest (C2), peat/mire (C4) and mixed (C7) (forest and mire) catchments. Acid deposition in this region is low and is further declining. Temporal trends in weather and runoff (1981-2008), dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] (1993-2010) and other water quality parameters (1987-2011) were assessed. There was no significant annual trend in precipitation or runoff. However, runoff increased in March and declined in May. This suggested an earlier snowmelt regime in recent years. Significant monotonic increasing trends in air temperature and length of growing season suggested a decrease in snowfall and less spring runoff. Stream [DOC] was positively correlated with some trace metals (copper, iron and zinc) and negatively with several other chemical parameters (e. g. sulfate, conductivity, calcium). Both sulfate and conductivity showed declining trends, while a significant increase was observed in pH during winter and spring. Calcium and magnesium showed monotonic decreasing trends. The declining trajectories of stream base cation and sulfate concentrations during other times of the year were not accompanied by changes in pH and alkalinity. These results indicate subtle effects of recovery from acidification. Water temperature increased significantly both annually and in most months. A simultaneous monotonic increase in iron (Fe) and [DOC] in autumn suggests co-transport of Fe-DOC in the form of organometallic complexes. monotonic increase in UV absorbance in most months without co-occurring changes in DOC trend suggests a shift in DOC quality to a more humic-rich type. The observed increase in soil solution [DOC] and subtle trends in stream [DOC] suggest that climate rather than recovery from acidification is the dominant driver of DOC trends in the Svartberget catchment.

AB The coastal zone of southeast Alaska contains thousands of streams and rivers that drain one of the wettest, carbon-rich, and most topographically varied regions in North America. Watersheds draining temperate rainforests, peatlands, glaciers, and three large rivers that flow from the drier interior of the Yukon Territory and British Columbia discharge water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into southeast Alaskan coastal waters. This area, which we have designated the southeast Alaska drainage basin (SEAKDB), discharges about twice as much water as the Columbia or Yukon Rivers. An understanding of the timing, location, and source of water and DOC guides research to better understand the influence of terrestrial outputs on the adjacent marine systems. Additionally, a spatially extensive understanding of riverine DOC flux will improve our understanding of lateral losses related to terrestrial carbon cycling. We estimate 1.17 Tg C yr(-1) of DOC enters the adjacent marine system along with 430 km(2) of freshwater that influences estuary, shelf, and Gulf of Alaska hydrology. We estimate that 23% to 66% of the DOC entering coastal waters is bioavailable and may influence metabolism and productivity within the marine system. The combination of the large and spatially distributed water and DOC input, long and complex shoreline, large enclosed estuarine volume, and bounded nearshore coastal currents suggests that the physiographic structure of southeast Alaska may have a significant impact on the metabolism of riverine DOC in coastal marine ecosystems.
   Plain Language Summary The coast of southeast Alaska drains coastal rainforests, glaciers, and interior basins in Alaska, British Columbia, and the Yukon. High precipitation, glacier melt, and large interior watersheds combine to discharge an annual volume of freshwater greater than that of the Columbia or Yukon Rivers, which drain basins 3.5 and 4.5 times larger. This large amount of water entering the Alexander Archipelago estuaries and coastal shelf creates currents and density gradients that influence how the river discharge and organic matter in it enter the Gulf of Alaska in the northern Pacific Ocean. Along with the large amount of water there is 1.17 Tg of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which can be taken up by bacteria and other microbes and turned into carbon dioxide or food that can be incorporated into the marine food web. A portion may settle into marine sediments to be stored for long periods of time. The amount and type of DOC and its entry into the marine ecosystem are controlled by watershed characteristics within the southeastern coast of Alaska. A better understanding of where and when DOC and freshwater enter the ocean may help us understand its importance to marine processes.

SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY

DT Article
ID ENGINEERING PROPERTIES; SOFT CLAYS; COMPRESSIBILITY; BEHAVIOR
AB Predictions from laboratory tests of the compression behaviour of peat from 14 sites are compared with full-scale field loading at five sites. Data presented confirm the heterogeneous nature of the deposits. However, for typical engineering works, calculations based on laboratory test data are likely to give reasonable predictions of the magnitude of immediate and primary compression. Standard (20 mm thickness) samples may give misleading data on time for primary consolidation. Thicker samples (e.g. 50 mm) should be used. Sampling by conventional samplers, as used for mineral soils, can cause densification of the peat, resulting in underestimation of actual settlement. Block samples or sample tubes with serrated cutting edges are recommended for peat soils. It was found that the data presented follow the C-alpha/C-c law of compressibility. There is also is some evidence to suggest that the H-2 scaling law may be applicable. Good correlations were found between vertical yield stress (p(vy)') and compression index (C-c) and index parameters such as water content (w(i)). Conventional staged construction with surcharge loading may be successfully applied to peat soils as long as adequate drainage exists to permit consolidation over reasonable time intervals.

AB In 2003, the remains of an Early Iron Age bog body, known as 'Oldcroghan Man', were recovered during the cutting of a drainage ditch in a bog in the Irish Midlands. Only some fingernails and a withe fragment remained undisturbed in situ in the drain face, providing the sole evidence for the original position of the body. A detailed reconstruction of the depositional context of the body has been undertaken through multi-proxy analyses of a peat monolith collected at the findspot. The palynological record shows that the surrounding area was the focus of intensive human activity during the Later Bronze Age, but was largely abandoned during the Bronze Age-Iron transition in the mid-first millennium BC. In the mid-4th century BC, a bog pool developed at the site, evidenced in the stratigraphic, plant macrofossil, testate amoebae and coleopteran records. Plant macrofossil and pollen analysis of peat samples associated with the fingernails suggests that the body was deposited in this pool most likely during the 3rd century BC. The absence of carrion beetle fauna points to complete submergence of the body within the pool. Deposition occurred shortly before or around the time that the surrounding area again became the focus of woodland clearance, as seen in the extended pollen record from the peat monolith. This period corresponds to the Early Iron Age in Ireland, during which renewed cultural connections with Britain and continental Europe can be seen in the archaeological record and widespread forest clearance is recorded in pollen records from across Ireland. The palaeoenvironmental results indicate, therefore, that the demise of Oldcroghan Man took place at a pivotal time of socio-economic and perhaps political change. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Ecosystem-scale flux of CO2 from a restored vacuum harvested peatland

AB At the ecosystem scale, the water and gas exchange processes are strongly coupled. Drainage and removal of a peatland's surface vegetation cover for peat harvesting alters its hydrology, and as a direct consequence the carbon budget. Previous studies have measured peatland-atmosphere carbon exchange using the chamber methodology. These studies have indicated that the spatial and temporal variability is large, suggesting the need for continuous ecosystem-scale measurements. This paper presents ecosystem scale measurements of the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) from a restored vacuum-harvested peatland in eastern Quebec, Canada, using the eddy correlation measurement approach.
   Results indicate that the adopted restoration practices reduce the loss of water from the peat. Evapotranspiration from the restored site was 20 and 25% less than that from an adjacent abandoned comparison site in 2000 and 2001 respectively. However, CO2 emissions remain large during non-snow periods (478 and 468 g C m(-2) in 2000 and 2001, respectively). The blockage of drainage ditches and the existence of a mulch cover at the site keep the moisture and thermal conditions more or less constant. Consequently, the CO2 flux, which is predominantly soil respiration, is strongly controlled by peat temperature fluctuations.

AB Peatland ecosystems have been important global carbon sinks throughout the Holocene. Most of the research on peatland carbon budgets and effects of variable weather conditions has been done in Northern Hemisphere Sphagnum-dominated systems. Given their importance in other geographic and climatic regions, a better understanding of peatland carbon dynamics is needed across the spectrum of global peatland types. In New Zealand, much of the historic peatland area has been drained for agriculture but little is known about rates of carbon exchange and storage in unaltered peatland remnants that are dominated by the jointed wire rush, Empodisma robustum. We used eddy covariance to measure ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes and a water balance approach to estimate the sub-surface flux of dissolved organic carbon from the largest remaining raised peat bog in New Zealand, Kopuatai bog. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was estimated over four years, which included two drought summers, a relatively wet summer, and a meteorologically average summer. In all measurement years, the bog was a substantial sink for carbon, ranging from 134.7 to 216.9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), owing to the large annual net ecosystem production (161.8 to 244.9 gCO(2)-Cm-2 yr(-1)). Annual methane fluxes were large relative to most Northern Hemisphere peatlands (14.2 to 21.9 gCH(4)-Cm-2 yr(-1)), although summer and autumn emissions were highly sensitive to dry conditions, leading to very predictable seasonality according to water table position. The annual flux of dissolved organic carbon was similar in magnitude to methane emissions but less variable, ranging from 11.7 to 12.8 gCm(-2) yr(-1). Dry conditions experienced during late summer droughts led to significant reductions in annual carbon storage, which resulted nearly equally from enhanced ecosystem respiration due to lowered water tables and increased temperatures, and from reduced gross primary production due to vapor pressure deficit-related stresses to the vegetation. However, the net C uptake of Kopuatai bog during drought years was large relative to even the maximum reported NECB from Northern Hemisphere bogs. Furthermore, global warming potential fluxes indicated the bog was a strong sink for greenhouse gases in all years despite the relatively large annual methane emissions. Our results suggest that adaptations of E. robustum to dry conditions lead to a resilient peatland drought response of the NECB.

AB The prehistoric Oer-IJ tidal system in the coastal area of Noord-Holland, between Castricum, Uitgeest, Velsen and Amsterdam, was the successor of the Haarlem tidal system when this was silted up around 3000 BC and large peat bogs formed in the Zaanstreek and Haarlemmermeer areas. Since then the Oer-IJ has been the natural outlet to the sea, draining the peat hinterlands. About 800 BC the Oer-IJ system was connected to the fluvial system of the Utrechtse Vecht and became the northern branch of the river Rhine. During the Late Iron Age, when the Flevo lakes in the IJsselmeer region and the Utrechtse Vecht were connected with the Wadden Sea, the Oer-IJ lost its discharge function. The tidal area silted up and was closed between 200 and 100 BC by a barrier ridge. The settlement history of the Oer-IJ system and the archaeological heritage in the subsurface is closely related to the geological and hydrological development throughout the ages. The shape and location of the continuously migrating outlet determined the opportunities for human settlements and activities. The best locations were beach ridges, higher, silted-up salt marshes and marginal zones of the peatland. In the Late Iron Age the sand flats also became habitable since tidal activity had stopped. In the Early Roman period there was no direct connection from the harbour of Castellum Flevum at Velsen to the North Sea, but ships could navigate from the Oer-IJ channel between Velsen and Amsterdam, through the Flevo lakes and the Utrechtse Vecht to the Wadden Sea, and to the Roman border (Limes) along the Oude Rijn. Here the data used for the palaeogeographic landscape reconstruction of the Oer-IJ are presented and explained, and the most important landscape-forming processes, which led to the emergence and closure of the Oer-IJ, are described. The landscape reconstructions give a new perspective on the migration of the main tidal channel and the formation of the tidal-inlet system near Castricum, which was the result of the progradation of the beach ridges south and north of the Castricummerpolder (Binnendelta according to De Roo, 1953). The geological and archaeological observations in the Binnendelta prove that the Oer-IJ was closed from the open sea in the early Late Iron Age.

AB Traditional laboratory methods for acquiring soil information remain important for assessing key soil properties, soil functions and ecosystem services over space and time. Infrared spectroscopic modeling can link and massively scale up these methods for many soil characteristics in a cost-effective and timely manner. In Switzerland, only 10 % to 15 % of agricultural soils have been mapped sufficiently to serve spatial decision support systems, presenting an urgent need for rapid quantitative soil characterization. The current Swiss soil spectral library (SSL; n = 4374) in the mid-infrared range includes soil samples from the Biodiversity Monitoring Program (BDM), arranged in a regularly spaced grid across Switzerland, and temporally resolved data from the Swiss Soil Monitoring Network (NABO). Given that less than 2 % of the samples in the SSL originate from organic soils, we aimed to develop both an efficient calibration sampling scheme and accurate modeling strategy to estimate the soil carbon (SC) contents of heterogeneous samples between 0 and 2 m depth from 26 locations within two drained peatland regions (School of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences (HAFL) data set; n = 116). The focus was on minimizing the need for new reference analyses by efficiently mining the spectral information of the SSL.
   We used partial least square regressions (PLSRs), together with five repetitions of a location-grouped, 10-fold cross-validation, to predict SC ranging from 1 % to 52 % in the local HAFL data set. We compared the validation performance of different calibration schemes involving local models (1), models using the entire SSL combined with local samples (2), commonly referred to as spiking, and subsets of local and SSL samples optimized for the peatland target sites using the resampling local (RS-LOCAL) algorithm (3). Using local and RS-LOCAL calibrations with at least five local samples, we achieved similar validation results for predictions of SC up to 52 % (R-2 = 0.93 to 0.97; bias = -0.07 to 1.65; root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.71 % to 3.89 % total carbon; ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) = 3.38 to 4.86; and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) = 4.93 to 7.09). However, calibrations using RS-LOCAL only required five or 10 local samples for very accurate models (RMSE = 3.16 % and 2.71 % total carbon, respectively), while purely local calibrations required 50 samples for similarly accurate results (RMSE < 3 % total carbon). Of the three approaches, the entire SSL spiked with local samples for model calibration led to validations with the lowest performance in terms of R-2, bias, RMSE, RPD and RPIQ. Hence, we show that a simple and comprehensible modeling approach, using RS-LOCAL together with a SSL, is an efficient and accurate strategy when using infrared spectroscopy. It decreases field and laboratory work, the bias of SSL spiking approaches and the uncertainty of local models. If adequately mined, the information in the SSL is sufficient to predict SC in new and independent study regions, even if the local soil characteristics are very different from the ones in the SSL. This will help to efficiently scale up the acquisition of quantitative soil information over space and time.

AB The Central European area has been extensively studied using qualitative reconstruction techniques focusing on the development of peatlands in the past; however, research based on quantitative techniques is still lacking, especially in relation to highlands and mountainous areas. In this study, we focused on the hydrological changes and human-induced disturbances that affected two raised bogs from the Orawa-Nowy Targ Basin (Carpathian region): Pucizna Krauszowska and Pucizna Maa. We aimed to reconstruct the development of peatlands and changes in water table under different intensities of human activities. Two peat sequences from two different bogs, both possessing absolute chronologies based on high-resolution C-14 dating, were examined in terms of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, plant macrofossils and testate amoeba records. We detected an asynchronous decrease in the water table level on the bogs that took place between the 4th and the 7th century ad, which occurred simultaneously with a global cold period ad 300-600 (Migration Period) in case of the Pucizna Maa bog. A concurrent but insignificant human impact on bogs was recorded. A distinct wet shift corresponding to the Wolf solar minimum (ca. ad 1280-1340) in Pucizna Maa was detected during ca. ad 1300-1350. The effect of this climatic event on bog hydrology is difficult to estimate because of the simultaneous human-induced deforestation. Drainage and substantial acceleration of peat extraction in the 19th and the 20th century ad led to the significant disturbances in peatland; however, these bogs were still susceptible to dry climatic events.

AB This study was conducted in the course of a fen rewetting project in NE Germany aiming to restore a heavily drained spring-percolation mire used as pasture land for more than 100 years. Shallow top soil removal (TSR) up to 40 cm was applied to remove the upper degraded peat layer in order to eliminate accumulated nutrients and unwanted seed banks as well as generating material for infilling drain ditchesand building dams. This measure has well known positive effects on species development, but very little was known about the phosphorus (P) status in the newly exposed peat soils and porewater. Therefore, we investigated (i) the P mobilisation potential of surface peat soils, (ii) net P release rates in intact soil cores with different degree of peat decomposition, and (iii) P concentrations in porewater of rewetted fen areas with TSR compared to areas without removal and refilled drain ditches. We highlighted that TSR strongly reduced the P mobilisation potential and thereby also the concentration of dissolved P in the porewater at the peat surface. Furthermore, we found low net P release rates close to 0 mg P m(-2) d(-1)( median, n = 9) in the cut-over areas with less degraded peat similar to those documented for natural fens. Despite of high P concentrations up to 2.6 mg L-1 in rewetted areas without TSR (about 50% of total peatland area) there was no evidence of elevated P export to other low-nutrient areas of the fen or in aclose-by lake due to high P retention capacity of the iron-rich degraded peat (molar Fe: P ratios >10). It can be concluded that TSR is a suitable measure to recover nutrient poor conditions in rewetted fens in a relatively short time frame instead of decades to centuries compared to rewetting measures without TSR. This measure is highly recommended if degraded peatlands are characterised by a low P retention capacity or low molar Fe/P ratios in degraded peat (<10) respectively and above all if downstream areas include nutrient-poor systems highly sensitive regarding slightly increased P inputs.

AB Diagnostic molecular ratios and compound-specific C-13 and C-14 analyses were used to identify n-alkane sources in surface sediments collected along a transect from an urbanized estuary draining a peat-rich catchment (Tyne, UK). The most abundant homologues were generally C-29 or C-31, and the carbon preference index (CPI; 1.8 to 6.4) and average chain length (ACL; 28.5 to 29.5) of C-25-C-33 n-alkanes became progressively lower in samples closer to the mouth of estuary. delta C-13 signatures of C-19-C-31 n-alkanes ranged from -37.1 to -29.3 parts per thousand. and in general became more depleted with increasing carbon number. Delta C-14 values for C-21 (-945 to -738 parts per thousand) were significantly more depleted compared to C-29 (-591 to -65 parts per thousand) and C-31 (-382 to -96 parts per thousand), pointing to a much higher component of fossil (i.e., C-14-free) carbon in the shorter homologue. The radiocarbon contents for these three n-alkanes decreased toward the North Sea, which in conjunction with an up to 4 parts per thousand seaward C-13-enrichment in C-29 and C-31 and seaward decreases in CPI and ACL pointed to petrogenic hydrocarbon contamination in lower estuarine sediments. Independent C-13 and C-14 mass balances used to calculate the relative proportions of modern (i.e., plant wax) and fossil (i.e., petrogenic) n-alkanes yielded similar results and demonstrated that mixing with marine-derived organic matter (OM) or microbial degradation during estuarine transport led to a seaward decline in modern, longer-chain homologues, resulting in an increasingly larger fossil carbon contribution toward the mouth of estuary. The ability to clearly distinguish anthropogenic from natural inputs suggests that compound-specific radiocarbon analysis can successfully delineate the age of terrigenous OM delivered to the coastal zone even near historically polluted systems such as the Tyne.

AB There are several sound sources and equipment used in information technology, which emit sound very close to the ear. The actual noise exposure of this equipment, communication hearing protectors and headsets for example, is difficult to evaluate through traditional methods. Therefore, new methods to evaluate noise exposure in real ears have been performed [1, 2]. The purposes of this study were to describe actual noise levels in the ear canal using measurements in real ears (MIRE-technique) and to evaluate the use of this technique in the field and in a laboratory. The measurements were carried out on snowplough car drivers and ice-hall workers, and also on volunteers in the noise laboratory. The personal daily noise exposures (L(Aeq,8h)) varied between 76-90 dB for workers. A-weighted equivalent sound levels varied in the ear canal between 66 and 93 dB in the laboratory tests. According to the results of this study, a noise level correction of -4 dB was concluded for ear amplification. In the case of measurements placed in front of the ear canal, the A-weighted equivalent levels could be used without any correction.

AB Drainage turns peatlands from natural carbon sinks into hotspots of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils due to alterations in hydrological and biogeochemical processes. As a consequence of drainage-induced mineralisation and anthropogenic sand addition, large areas of former peatlands under agricultural use have soil organic carbon (SOC) contents at the boundary between mineral and organic soils. Previous research has shown that the variability of GHG emissions increases with anthropogenic disturbance. However, how and whether sand addition affects GHG emissions remains a controversial issue. The aim of this long-term incubation experiment was to assess the influence of hydrological and biogeochemical soil properties on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Strongly degraded peat with sand addition (peat-sand mixtures) and without sand addition (earthified peat) was systematically compared under different moisture conditions for fen and bog peat. Soil columns originating from both the topsoil and the subsoil of ten different peatlands under grassland use were investigated. Over a period of six months the almost saturated soil columns were drained stepwise via suction to -300 hPa. The CO2 fluxes were lowest at water-saturated and dry soil moisture conditions, resulting in a parabolic dependence of CO2 fluxes on the water-filled pore space (WFPS) peaking at 56-92% WFPS. The highest N2O fluxes were found at between 73 and 95% WFPS. Maximum CO2 fluxes were highest from topsoils, ranging from 21 to 77 mg C m(-2) h(-1), while the maximum CO2 fluxes from subsoils ranged from 3 to 14 mg C m(-2) h(-1). No systematic influence of peat type or sand addition on GHG emissions was found in topsoils, but CO2 fluxes from subsoils below peat-sand mixtures were higher than from subsoils below earthified peat. Maximum N2O fluxes were highly variable between sites and ranged from 18.5 to 234.9 and from 0.2 to 22.9 mu g N m-2 h-1 for topsoils and subsoils, respectively. CH4 fluxes were negligible even under water-saturated conditions. The highest GHG emissions occurred at a WFPS that relates - under equilibrium conditions - to a water table of 20-60 cm below the surface in the field. High maximum CO2 and N2O fluxes were linked to high densities of plant-available phosphorus and potassium. The results of this study highlight that nutrient status plays a more important role in GHG emissions than peat type or sand addition, and do not support the idea of peat-sand mixtures as a mitigation option for GHG emissions.

AB Natural soil pipes are found in peatlands, but little is known about their hydrological role. This paper presents the most complete set of pipe discharge data to date from a deep blanket peatland in Northern England. In a 17.4-ha catchment, we identified 24 perennially flowing and 60 ephemerally flowing pipe outlets. Eight pipe outlets along with the catchment outlet were continuously gauged over an 18-month period. The pipes in the catchment were estimated to produce around 13.7% of annual streamflow, with individual pipes often producing large peak flows (maximum peak of 3.8ls1). Almost all pipes, whether ephemerally or perennially flowing, shallow or deep (outlets>1m below the peat surface), showed increased discharge within a mean of 3h after rainfall commencement and were dominated by stormflow, indicating good connectivity between the peatland surface and the pipes. However, almost all pipes had a longer period between the hydrograph peak and the return to base flow compared with the stream (mean of 23.9h for pipes, 19.7h for stream). As a result, the proportion of streamflow produced by the pipes at any given time increased at low flows and formed the most important component of stream discharge for the lowest 10% of flows. Thus, a small number of perennially flowing pipes became more important to the stream system under low-flow conditions and probably received water via matrix flow during periods between storms. Given the importance of pipes to streamflow in blanket peatlands, further research is required into their wider role in influencing stream water chemistry, water temperature and fluvial carbon fluxes, as well as their role in altering local hydrochemical cycling within the peat mass itself. Enhanced piping within peatlands caused by environmental change may lead to changes in the streamflow regime with larger low flows and more prolonged drainage of the peat.

AB A sequential chemical extraction procedure was implemented in order to ascertain the chemical speciation of Ra-226, U-238 and Ra-228 within fractions of an upland organic soil. A number of samples and depth cores were taken from a region where the soil contains elevated levels of these radionuclides. Sequential chemical extractions were employed to identify within which of the three soil phases, namely exchangeable cations, easily oxidisable organic matter or iron oxides, the radionuclides were incorporated. The primary analytical technique was high-resolution gamma ray spectrometry. A number of other chemical parameters likely to affect the mode of occurrence of the radionuclides were also analysed. These included humic acid content, iron and manganese content and cation exchange capacity. Results indicate that the average amount of radionuclides bound as exchangeable cations, expressed as a percentage of the specific activities of each radionuclide, are: Ra-226 - 2.13% (S.D. 2.15), U-238 - 5.2% (S.D. 4.6) and Ra-228 - 12.2% (S.D. 7.0). For easily oxidisable organic matter, the average percentages are: Ra-226 - 3.2% (S.D. 3.2), U-238 - 21.9% (S.D. 18.4), and Ra-228 - 8.5% (S.D. 8.7). Percentages for iron oxides are Ra-226 - 8.7% (S.D. 7.5), U-238 - 54.8% (S.D. 22.2) and Ra-228 - 19.7 % (S.D. 12.9). N equals 17 in all cases. The results indicate that the primary factor controlling U-238 accumulation, and to a lesser extent Ra-226 and Ra-228, is the redox condition of the peat. Release of radionuclides from the peat could possibly occur via changes in the redox status as a result of activities such as forestry or drainage of the peat.

AB Permanent grasslands constitute the most widespread land use type for agriculturally managed peatlands in Europe. They are typically significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere as a result of drainage-induced peat decomposition, but quantitative data are still scarce. This study presents an in-depth analysis of CO2 flux variability at the site (n=3) and plot scale (n=9) for different Danish permanent grasslands on peat. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and ecosystem respiration were monitored over one year with closed dynamic chambers. The first part of the data analysis consisted of a detailed evaluation of the flux dataset to gain insight into the potential effects of fast fluctuations in the wind and light intensity on the plot scale CO2 flux. In the second part of the analysis, gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration were modeled on the field and plot scale with candidate sets of simple light and temperature response models commonly applied in ecological studies. The detailed flux dataset analysis revealed that upward concave flux curves, which are not explainable by diffusion theory, can either be the result of a fan-induced increase in headspace turbulence, or of a photosynthesis overshoot into shaded or darkened chamber measurement periods. Instead of discarding such measurements from the dataset, this study proposes the use of linear flux calculation as a way to obtain less biased flux rate estimates. For the carbon balance modeling, it could be shown that annual NEE estimates for a site differ (0.2-0.3 kg CO2 m(-2)) between different models available for gap-filling CO2 flux time series even when the models were equally suitable according to statistical evaluation. Overall, all plots showed significant carbon losses over the course of a year (1.5-5.6 kg CO2 m(-2), including harvested aboveground biomass); however, it was not possible to relate spatial differences in the CO2 flux dynamics between and within the study sites to certain peat properties or management types due to high uncertainties in the annual estimates.

AB Globally, peatlands are regarded as important carbon stores and their conservation essential for ensuring continuation of terrestrial carbon storage. Numerous peatlands in particular regions of Europe have been degraded by drainage, burning, extraction, overgrazing and pollution in recent decades, often leading to erosion, loss of peat mass and a loss of a variety of flora. In the UK, some 90% of peatlands can be regarded as degraded. Implemented restoration schemes have been aimed at blocking drainage ditches, re-vegetating bare peat or changing the present vegetation assemblage to a more 'desirable' alternative. Here we use palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct the development of a blanket peatland through its entirety with a particular focus on recent land management practices and their impact on vegetation in order to determine and support restoration targets. Analysis at West Arkengarthdale, Yorkshire, UK, shows that the present vegetation is not characteristic and has only been present for c. 200 years. Peat has been developing at the site for approximately 6700 years with Sphagnum particularly abundant between 0-40 cm depth (present day-450 cal. BP) and 150-190 cm depth (c. 3200-3900 cal. BP) and seldom recorded elsewhere in the core. A very recent change in Sphagnum composition is seen towards the surface of the profile, with Sphagnum papillosum making up 100% of the identified Sphagnum in the last 50 years. Monocots, Poaceae, Rumex and Polytrichum commune increase with the beginning of the industrial revolution and an increase in charcoal fragments is indicative of increased pollution and managed burning to support grouse management. It is suggested that any intention to alter land management at the site to encourage a greater variety of Sphagnum species and a decrease in Calluna is in line with peatland development at the site over the past 450 years. This collaborative approach between research palaeoecologists and conservation agency staff has wider application elsewhere. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The delta(13)C values fi individual trihalomethanes (THM) formed on reaction of chlorine with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leached from maize (corn; Zea maize L.) and Scirpus acutus (an aquatic bulrush), and with DOC extracted from agricultural drainage waters were determined using purge and trap introduction into a gas chromatograph-combustion-isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometer. We observed a 16.8 parts per thousand difference between the delta(13)C values of THM produced from the maize and Scirpus leachates, similar to the isotopic difference between the whole plant materials. Both maize and Scirpus formed THM 12 parts per thousand lower than C-13 than whole plant material. We suggest that the low value of the THM relative to th whole plant material is evidence of distinct pools of THM-forming DOC, representing different biochemical types or chemical structures, and possessing different environmental reactivity.
   Humic extracts of waters draining an agricultural field containing Scirpus peat soils and planted with maize amy contribute significantly to the THM-forming DOC. The difference between the delta(13)C values of the whole isolate and that of the THM it yielded was 3.9 parts per thousand, however, suggesting diagnesis plays a role in deermining the delta(13)C value of THM-forming DOC in the drainage waters, and precluding the direct use fo siotopic mixing models to quantitatively attribute sources.

AB Fens are organic sites that require drainage for agricultural use. Lowering the groundwater level leads to trade-offs between economic benefits and environmental impacts (i.e., CO2 and nutrient emissions). To identify management options that are both environmentally and economically sustainable, a propaedeutic systematic analysis of the costs, income and profit of different land use and management systems on fenlands is necessary. This study provides an overview of the profitability, labor demand and comparative advantages of feasible management systems on German fenlands. Twenty management practices in four land use systems are analyzed. The results indicate that most management systems are profitable only with subsidies and payments for ecosystem services. In addition to sales revenue, these payments are indispensable to promote peat-saving agricultural practices on fenlands. Regarding the labor aspect, intensive management systems caused an increase in working hours per hectare, which may positively affect employment in rural areas. The calculations obtained in this study can be used as a basis for estimations of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation costs when management systems are associated with GHG emission values.

AB A peat deposit (Zennare basin, Venice coastland, Italy) was monitored in previous field studies to investigate the hydrological response of organic soil to meteorological dynamics. Field tests and modelling predictions highlighted the risk of the complete loss of this peat layer during the next 50 years, due to oxidation enhanced by the increased frequency of warmer periods. Unfortunately, despite the considerable impacts that are expected to affect peat bogs (in this area and worldwide), only a few experimental studies have been carried out to assess the hydrologic response of peat to severe water scarcity. Because of that, an undisturbed 0.7 m(3) peat monolith was collected, transferred to the laboratory and instrumented. The total weight (representative of the water content dynamics of the peat monolith as a whole), and two vertical profiles of matric potentials and water content were monitored in controlled water-scarce conditions. After an extended air-drying period, the monolith was used as an undisturbed peat lysimeter and a complete cycle of wetting and drainage was performed. Supplementary measurements of matric potential psi and water content theta were collected by testing peat subsamples on a suction table apparatus. A set of water retention curves was determined in a range of matric potentials broader (psi down to -7 m) than the current natural conditions in the field (minimum psi = -1 m). While water content at saturation showed values similar to those in the original natural conditions (theta approximately equal to 0.8), a remarkable loss of water holding capacity (even for low potentials) has been highlighted, especially in deep layers that are now permanently below the water table. The retention curves changed shape and values, with a more pronounced hysteresis visible in an increasing distance between wetting and drying data. Hydraulic non-equilibrium between the water content and water potential could be a possible cause and it is worth modelling in future studies. The parameters of the van Genuchten retention curves were obtained for the wetting and the drying phases.

AB Landscape management schemes can have unanticipated effects on native species. While we tend to label habitat alterations as distinctly good or bad for specific species, it is not always clear what constitutes good habitat and what is low quality habitat. In many managed landscapes, there is a cyclical nature to these alterations, with some stages in the management cycle increasing suitability and others degrading it. In Ireland, afforested blanket bogs are managed to create a cycle of mature conifer forest alternating with a clear-felled landscape. These plantation forests have the potential to fragment naturally occurring amphibian habitat and reduce access to suitable breeding sites, though it is not clear how each management stage actually affects amphibian populations. We studied one of Ireland's three amphibians, the European Common Frog (Rana temporaria), to identify if parts of these plantations contained good breeding habitat. We conducted our study in the west of Ireland, comparing breeding habitat availability and use among pools in mature plantation forests, clear-felled areas, unplanted blanket bogs, and roadside drainage ditches. Frog breeding use and reproductive output was highest in drainage ditches and clear-felled sites. Mature plantations had lower pool densities and spawn clump densities than either drainage ditches or clear-felled sites, and no larval development. Pools with high pH, large surface area, and high temperatures had the highest probability of spawn presence. Plantation forestry can be detrimental to Common Frogs, but applying sequential harvest strategies may allow this species to persist within plantations as habitat availability shifts over time.

AB In European peatlands which have been drained and cut-over in the past, re-vegetation often stagnates after the return of a species-poor Sphagnum community. Re-introduction of currently absent species may be a useful tool to restore a typical, and more diverse, Sphagnum vegetation and may ultimately improve the functioning of peatland ecosystems, regarding atmospheric carbon sequestration. Yet, the factors controlling the success of re-introduction are unclear. In Ireland and Estonia, we transplanted small and large aggregates of three Sphagnum species into existing vegetation. We recorded changes in cover over a 3-year period, at two water levels (-5 and -20 cm).
   Performance of transplanted aggregates of Sphagnum was highly species specific. Hummock species profited at low water tables, whereas hollow species profited at high water tables. But Our results indicate that performance and establishment of species was also promoted by increased aggregate size. This mechanism (positive self-association) has earlier been seen in other ecosystems, but our results are the first to show this mechanism in peatlands. Our results do not agree with present management, which is aimed at retaining water on the surface of peat remnants in order to restore a functional and diverse Sphagnum community. More than the water table, aggregate size of the reintroduced species is crucial for species performance, and ultimately for successful peatland restoration. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

TI MODELS TO PREDICT ORGANIC CONTENT OF LAKE-SEDIMENTS

DE LAKE ECOSYSTEMS; ORGANIC MATTER; SEDIMENTS
ID WATER-QUALITY; FLOCCULATION
AB The aim of this study is to quantify and rank variables of significance to predict mean organic content (IG, loss on ignition) of surficial (0-1 cm) lake sediments in small glacial lakes. Various hypotheses concerning the factors regulating IG in lakes were formulated and tested. Different statistical tests were used to separate random influences from causal influences. The best model provides an r(2)-value (r = the correlation coefficient) of 0.83 when model data are compared to empirical data. This model is based on five readily available, standard map parameters: the percent of till and mires in the drainage area, the size and relief of the catchment, and the volume development (= the form factor), linked to resuspension and form and size of the lake. Each of these variables only provides a limited degree of (statistical) explanation of the variability in IG among the lakes. The predictability of the model can not be improved by accounting for the zonation problem, (i.e., the distribution of the characteristics in the drainage area, as given by the Drainage Area Zonation-method, DAZ), or for water chemical variables (pH, alkalinity, conductivity, total-P, colour, etc.). The model allows mean values of IG to be estimated from readily available data of ''geological'' characteristics of the lake and its drainage area. The variability in IG from other factors/variables, such as specific anthropogenic sources, etc. may then be quantitatively differentiated from the impact of these ''geological'' factors. These predictive models are, to the best of the author's knowledge, the first ever to be presented for IG. These empirical models can only, however, be used to predict IG for lakes of the same lake type, and for lakes with model variables within the range of the given model variables.

AB Drainage has turned peatlands from a carbon sink into one of the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) sources from cultivated soils. We analyzed a unique data set (12 peatlands, 48 sites and 122 annual budgets) of mainly unpublished GHG emissions from grasslands on bog and fen peat as well as other soils rich in soil organic carbon (SOC) in Germany. Emissions and environmental variables were measured with identical methods. Site-averaged GHG budgets were surprisingly variable (29.2 +/- 17.4 t CO2-eq. ha(-1)yr(-1)) and partially higher than all published data and the IPCC default emission factors for GHG inventories. Generally, CO2 (27.7 +/- 17.3 t CO(2)ha(-1)yr(-1)) dominated the GHG budget. Nitrous oxide (2.3 +/- 2.4kg N2O-N ha(-1)yr(-1)) and methane emissions (30.8 +/- 69.8kg CH4-C ha(-1)yr(-1)) were lower than expected except for CH4 emissions from nutrient-poor acidic sites. At single peatlands, CO2 emissions clearly increased with deeper mean water table depth (WTD), but there was no general dependency of CO2 on WTD for the complete data set. Thus, regionalization of CO2 emissions by WTD only will remain uncertain. WTD dynamics explained some of the differences between peatlands as sites which became very dry during summer showed lower emissions. We introduced the aerated nitrogen stock (N-air) as a variable combining soil nitrogen stocks with WTD. CO2 increased with N-air across peatlands. Soils with comparatively low SOC concentrations showed as high CO2 emissions as true peat soils because N-air was similar. N2O emissions were controlled by the WTD dynamics and the nitrogen content of the topsoil. CH4 emissions can be well described by WTD and ponding duration during summer. Our results can help both to improve GHG emission reporting and to prioritize and plan emission reduction measures for peat and similar soils at different scales.

AB Ten year old Sitka spruce [Picea sitchensis (BONG.) CARR.], growing in a commercial plantation, on a drained, acid peat were sprayed with simulated mist providing a 'no spray', N alone, S alone and a combination of N, S and acidity at pH 5 and 2.5, (single and double dose) treatments. Approximately twice weekly from May (budburst) to December, six treatments (equivalent to 2 mm precipitation) Na2SO4, NH4NO3, H2SO4 + NH4NO3 at pH 2.5 (single and double dose), and pH 5 and an unsprayed control were applied, to four replicate chambers of 10 trees. The treatment 'chambers' comprised a framework of poles, supporting 2 full cone sprayers per tree mounted within 0.5 m of the tops of the trees, without wall structures. This paper reports some sensitive indicators of treatment effects, stemwood growth, foliar chemistry and frost hardiness, together with measurements of soil chemistry after one and two treatment seasons.
   In the first year of treatment no significant effects on growth were found although stem basal area increment increased by approximately 50%. After one year of treatment there was a tendency for shoots receiving N/acidity to be least frost hardy when tested in December (by approximately 4 degrees C). Foliar S, N and Mg concentrations were significantly increased in response to S and N additions. In the second year, no biologically significant effects were found. Two years of treatment with N and S, both with and without acidity, still failed to affect growth measured as relative stem basal area increment. However, relative increments in stem volume indicated a significant positive response to the acidified S + N treatments after two treatment seasons. Initial findings are discussed in relation to results from similar studies in controlled environments and the field. Early indications are that the sail nutrient supply is dominating the tree response to N, S and acid treatment. and that acidified S and N inputs are not damaging the trees but have stimulated growth over the first 2 years of treatment.

AB The improvement of soil conditions by water table lowering through drainage is indicative of the potential for tree growth response to this treatment. We measured water table level, peat water content and temperature, and rates of decomposition of Sphagnum peat, cellulose and wood sticks in a black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP.) peatland of eastern Quebec, on a control site and a drained site. In general, the water table was lowered within 15 m of the ditches, resulting in a marked difference between spacings of 20-30 m and 40-50-60 m. In the middle of the 40-m spacing, the frequencies of lowering below the root zone (20 cm) and the 30-cm depth were respectively increased by 33% and 40%. Feat water content at 10-cm depth decreased by 20% to 29% following drainage and the effect appeared related to ditch closeness. At 20- and 30-cm depths, decreases of the same order were observed only at 5 m from the ditch. At distances of 10 m and more, the average water content remained within 10% of saturation at 20 cm and within 5% at 30 cm. After drainage, the seasonal maximum temperature at the 10-cm depth increased by 3.5 degrees C at 5 m from the ditch and by 1.5 degrees C al greater distances, compared to the control where the mean seasonal maximum was 13.5 degrees C. At ail distances, the autumnal cooling of the substrate was accelerated and winter temperature was 1 to 2 degrees C less than the control site. Temperature at 30-cm depth was not modified by drainage. Rates of decomposition were accelerated, mainly at the 30-cm depth and within the first 10 m from the ditch. At 10-cm depth, decomposition was weakly related to drainage and it is possible that relatively low water contents countered the effect of temperature increase.

AB Stratigraphic relationships, radiocarbon dating, sediment and peat characteristics, and rates of peat and carbon accumulation from a soligenous peatland, or "bofedal," in the Chilean Altiplano shows the peatland to be unusually young, dynamic, and sensitive to environmental changes. The site lies in the National Park Nevado de Tres Cruces in the puna desert grassland at an elevation of 4300 m a.s.l. Eight peat cores were extracted from a 1.75-km transect yielding a maximum of 3.6 in of organic sediment. Organic matter began to accumulate 1700-1100 cal yr B.P. under a progressively and local climate, after a period when regional climate is believed to have been more humid than at present. Areas of greater relief and better drainage in the valley bottom eventually fostered the growth of a riparian cushion plant community after water flowing down the valley began to diminish. This led to rapid lateral expansion of the riparian peatland communities over open water in topographic depressions at a rate heretofore unprecedented in the peatland literature. It appears that development of the peatland has been encouraged by autoregulation of internal hydrology. The drainage impediment created by organic mass accumulation in lower-relief areas probably reduced the amount of water arriving at the lower reaches of the peatland. These areas have become progressively drier and have since died and oxidized. Through endogenous peat accumulation and a concomitant drainage impediment, the ecosystem has been migrating upstream over the past 50 years. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB This study reports the annual carbon balance of a drained riparian fen under two-cut or three-cut managements of festulolium and tall fescue. CO2 fluxes measured with closed chambers were partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) for modelling according to environmental factors (light and temperature) and canopy reflectance (ratio vegetation index, RVI). Methodological assessments were made of (i) GPP models with or without temperature functions (Ft) to adjust GPP constraints imposed by low temperature (< 10 degrees C) and (ii) ER models with RVI or GPP parameters as biomass proxies. The sensitivity of the models was also tested on partial datasets including only alternate measurement campaigns and on datasets only from the crop growing period. Use of Ft in GPP models effectively corrected GPP overestimation in cold periods, and this approach was used throughout. Annual fluxes obtained with ER models including RVI or GPP parameters were similar, and also annual GPP and ER fluxes obtained with full and partial datasets were similar. Annual CO2 fluxes and biomass yield were not significantly different in the crop/management combinations although the individual collars (n = 12) showed some variations in GPP (-1818 to -2409g CO2-C m(-2)), ER (1071 to 1738g CO2-C m(-2)), net ecosystem exchange (NEE, -669 to -949g CO2-C m(-2)) and biomass yield (556 to 1044g CO2-C m(-2)). Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB), as the sum of NEE and biomass carbon export, was only slightly negative to positive in all crop/management combinations. NECBs, interpreted as emission factors, tended to favour the least biomass producing systems as the best management options in relation to climate saving carbon balances. Yet, considering the down-stream advantages of biomass for fossil fuel replacement, yield-scaled carbon fluxes are suggested to be given additional considerations for comparison of management options in terms of atmospheric impact.

AB Anthropogenic activities on peatlands, such as drainage, can increase sediment transport and deposition downstream resulting in harmful ecological impacts. The objective of this study was to quantify changes in erosion/deposition quantities and surface roughness in peatland forest ditches by measuring changes in ditch cross-sections and surface microtopography with two alternative methods: manual pin meter and terrestrial laser scanning (TSL). The methods were applied to a peat ditch and a ditch with a thin peat layer overlaying erosion sensitive mineral soil within a period of two years following ditch cleaning. The results showed that erosion was greater in the ditch with exposed mineral soil than in the peat ditch. The two methods revealed rather similar estimates of erosion and deposition for the ditch with the thin peat layer where cross-sectional changes were large, whereas the results for smaller scale erosion and deposition at the peat ditch differed. The TLS-based erosion and deposition quantities depended on the size of the sampling window used in the estimations. Surface roughness was smaller when calculated from the pin meter data than from the TLS data. Both methods indicated that roughness increased in the banks of the ditch with a thin peat layer. TLS data showed increased roughness also in the peat ditch. The increase in surface roughness was attributed to erosion and growth of vegetation. Both methods were suitable for the measurements of surface roughness and microtopography at the ditch cross-section scale, but the applicability, rigour, and ease of acquisition of TLS data were more evident. The main disadvantage of the TLS instrument (Leica ScanStation 2) compared with pin meter was that even a shallow layer of humic (dark brown) water prevented detection of the ditch bed. The geomorphological potential of the methods was shown to be limited to detection of surface elevation changes >similar to 0.1 m. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Peat bogs of eastern North America are increasingly being mined for peat, which results in the extensive draining of these systems. First, I quantified the effects of peat mining on amphibian species richness and abundance in bog remnants adjacent to mining activity and unmined bogs. I then investigated amphibian occurrence patterns in bog remnants relative to the distance to the mined edge, after accounting for microhabitat and distance to landscape elements. The response of amphibians to peat mining varied across taxa. For instance, amphibian species richness, total amphibian captures (all spp. combined), as well as those of green frogs (Rana clamitans) were greater in unmined bogs than in bog remnants. Wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) were most abundant in unmined bogs in areas far from bog ponds, as well as in unmined bogs in areas near shrub patches. After accounting for microhabitat and landscape variables, American toads (Bufo americanus) in bog remnants were most abundant close to mined edges, whereas the other species did not respond to the proximity of mined edges. Peat mining negatively impacts amphibians occurring in bog remnants. The response of amphibians to peat mining is similar to the one of birds and plants, but differs with small mammals. Maintaining a complex mosaic of bog ponds, shrub and forest patches might help mitigate peat mining effects on amphibian patterns of abundance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The behaviour of Chernobyl-derived Cs-137 in a hydrologically isolated bog system in the catchment of the Pripyat River, Belarus was investigated. Measurements were made of Cs-137 activities in the solids and pore waters of the bog soils, as well as the variability in activity in water draining from the bog. It was found that the radiocaesium activity of the pore water, and hence the measured distribution coefficient. K-d, was dependent upon the pressure at which the water was removed from the soil. Measured values of K-d were of the order 10(2) l/kg at an extraction pressure of 0.8 MPa, approximately one order of magnitude lower than those measured in a similar system, Devoke Water, in the UK [1]. Results of comparative measurements suggested that this was a result of the different pore water extraction techniques used. The vertical migration of radiocaesium was modelled using a solution of the advection-diffusion equation. Using a mass balance approach, it was estimated that Cs-137 was removed from the system at a rate of 0.3%, of the catchment inventory per year, similar to 8 years after the Chernobyl accident. It was shown that both vertical migration and removal of Cs-137 is best modelled using a K-d based on a measurement of pore water held at low pressure in the soil, similar to 10(3) l/kg. Cs-137 activities in soil pore waters and in drainage waters were very strongly related to the aqueous potassium concentration. and both showed concentration minima in drainage water during the spring. It was shown that runoff coefficients of radiocaesium from peat bogs 8 years after the Chernobyl accident were approximately one order of magnitude greater than those from unsaturated soils of higher mineral content.

ID DRAINAGE
AB (1) Water-table depths on high-level blanket bog were compared at different distances from moor-drains and with depths on nearby undrained bog.  Cover-abundances of ten plant species were compared with the results for water-tables.
   (2) Water-table depths fluctuated with rainfall, but less so beside drains than farther away, and less than on undrained bog.
   (3) Mean water-tables near to drains were lower than at places farther away, but the lowering was slight and confined to a zone only a few metres wide on either side of the drain.  On sloping ground, the zone was narrower on the uphill side than the downhill side.
   (4) Plant species dependent on high water-tables had lower cover-abundance near to drains, and species with drier heathland affinities had higher cover than at places farther away.  As with water-tables, this effect was asymmetrical, but more so; several species showed altered cover on the downslope side alone.
   (5) Vegetation data for one site over 25 years showed that most long-term effects were confined to the downslope side of drains.  Cover of Calluna peaked after 8 years but declined thereafter, while declines in cover of Sphagnum were highly localized and took nearly 20 years to achieve statistical significance.
   (6) The conclusion is that drains acted mainly to intercept surface run-off, and withdrew water from the peat only alongside the drain edge.  Run-off entering the drain from above reduced or nullified plant responses to the water-table on the upslope side, and the reduced run-off below the drain enhanced the response there.

AB British vegetation is estimated to contain 113.8 million tC, 80 per cent of which is in forests and woodlands (91.9 million tC). Sitka spruce plantations, although covering 21.4 per cent of the forest/woodland area, contain only 8.2 per cent of the forest/woodland carbon, because the plantations are young and have an average of only 14.1 tC ha(-1). Broadleaved woodlands in Britain have an average of 61.9 tC ha(-1) and contain 46.8 per cent of the total carbon in all vegetation. A breakdown is given of the carbon density (tC ha(-1)) and content of different tree species. A carbon density map of Britain highlights the concentration of carbon in the broadleaved woodlands in southern England and in the large conifer plantations in southern Scotland and northern England.
   Carbon storage in the trees, products, litter and soil can be evaluated in terms of long-term equilibrium storage or short-term rate of storage. These two components vary among forest types in Britain and globally. Plantations harvested at the time of maximum mean annual increment (MAI) will not store as much carbon as mature, old-growth forests on the same site unless they have long-lasting products and/or are very fast growing. Maximum equilibrium carbon storage is generally achieved by harvesting at the time of maximum MAI when the lifetime of products exceeds the time to maximum MAI. Undisturbed peatlands sequester CO2 and emit CH4, and may be greenhouse neutral. When peatlands are drained and planted with trees, they stop emitting CH4 and store carbon in the trees, forest litter, forest soil and wood products. However, these greenhouse gas 'gains' are offset by the oxidation to CO2 of the pear, and the gains are exceeded by CO2 losses when 20-40 cm depth of peat has been oxidized. Forests in Britain are currently sequestering 1.5-1.7 million tC a(-1) in trees, 0.3-0.5 tC a(-1) in litter and 0.5 million tC a(-1) in wood products, totalling about 2.5 million tC, equivalent to about 1.5 per cent of the carbon currently emitted by burning fossil fuels in the UK. In order to maintain the current forest carbon sink, the forest area needs to continue to expand at about 25000 ha a(-1) of upland conifers or 10000 ha a(-1) of poplars on good land.

AB Biologically mediated redox processes in the riparian zone, like denitrification, can have Substantially beneficial impacts on stream water quality. The extent of these effects, however. depends greatly oil the hydrological boundary conditions. The impact of hydrological processes oil a wetland's nitrogen sink capacity was investigated in a forested riparian fen which is drained by a first-order perennial stream. Here, we analysed the frequency distributions and time-series of pH and nitrogen, silica, organic carbon and oxygen concentrations in throughfall, soil solution, groundwater and stream water, and the groundwater levels and stream discharges from a 3-year period. During baseflow conditions, the stream was fed by discharging shallow, anoxic groundwater and by deep, oxic groundwater. Whereas the latter delivered considerable amounts of nitrogen (similar to 0-37 mg l(-1)) to the stream, the former was almost entirely depleted of nitrogen. During stormflow, near-surface runoff in the upper 30 cut soil layer bypassed the denitrifying zone and added significant amounts to the nitrogen load of the stream. Nitrate-nitro-en was close to 100% of deep groundwater and stream-water nitrogen concentration. Stream-water baseflow concentrations of nitrate, dissolved carbon and silica were about 1.6 mg l(-1), 4 mg l(-1) and 7.5 mg l(-1) respectively, and > 3 mg l(-1), > 10 mg l(-1) and < 4 mg l(-1) respectively during discharge peaks. In addition to that macroscale bypassing effect, there was evidence for a corresponding microscale effect: Shallow groundwater sampled by soil suction CLIPS indicated complete denitrification and lacked any seasonal signal Of Solute concentration, which was in contrast to piezometer samples from the same depth. Moreover, mean solute concentration in the piezometer samples resembled more that of suction-cup samples from shallower depth than that of the same depth. We conclude that the soil Solution CLIPS sampled to a large extent the immobile soil-water fraction. In contrast, the mobile fraction that was sampled by the piezometers exhibited substantially shorter residence time, thus being less exposed to denitrification, but predominating discharge of that layer to the stream. Consequently, assessing the nitrogen budget based on suction-cup data tended to overestimate the nitrogen consumption in the riparian wetland. These effects are likely to become more important with the increased frequency and intensity of rainstorms that are expected due to climate change. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID MANAGEMENT; BUDGETS
AB Background, Aim and Scope. Coastal and river plains are the surfaces of depositional systems, to which sediment input is a parameter of key-importance. Their habitation and economic development usually requires protection with dikes, quays, etc., which are effective in retaining floods but have the side effect of impeding sedimentation in their hinterlands. The flood-protected Dutch lowlands (so-called dike-ring areas) have been sediment-starved for up to about a millennium. In addition to this, peat decomposition and soil compaction, brought about by land drainage, have caused significant land subsidence. Sediment deficiency, defined as the combined effect of sediment-starvation and drainage-induced volume losses, has already been substantial in this area, and it is expected to become urgent in view of the forecasted effects of climate change (sea-level rise, intensified precipitation and run-off). We therefore explore this deficiency, compare it with natural (Holocene) and current human sediment inputs, and discuss it in terms of long-term land-use options.
   Materials and Methods. We use available 3D geological models to define natural sediment inputs to our study area. Recent progress in large-scale modelling of peat oxidation and compaction enables us to address volume loss associated with these processes. Human sediment inputs are based on published minerals statistics. All results are given as first-order approximations.
   Results. The current sediment deficit in the diked lowlands of the Netherlands is estimated at 136 +/- 67 million m(3)/a. About 85% of this volume is the hypothetical amount of sediment required to keep up with sea-level rise, and 15% is the effect of land drainage (peat decomposition and compaction). The average Holocene sediment input to our study area (based on a total of 145 km(3)) is similar to 14 million m(3)/a, and the maximum (millennium-averaged) input similar to 26 million m(3)/a. Historical sediment deficiency has resulted in an unused sediment accommodation space of about 13.3 km(3). Net human input of sediment material currently amounts to similar to 23 million m(3)/a.
   Discussion. As sedimentary processes in the Dutch lowlands have been retarded, the depositional system's natural resilience to sea-level rise is low, and all that is left to cope is human countermeasure. Preserving some sort of status quo with water management solutions may reach its limits in the foreseeable future. The most viable long-term option therefore seems a combination of allowing for more water in open country (anything from flood-buffer zones to open water) and raising lands that are to be built up (enabling their lasting protection). As to the latter, doubling or tripling the use of filling sand in a planned and sustained effort may resolve up to one half of the Dutch sediment deficiency problems in about a century.
   Conclusions, Recommendations and Perspectives. We conclude that sediment deficiency-past, present and future-challenges the sustainable habitation of the Dutch lowlands. In order to explore possible solutions, we recommend the development of long-term scenarios for the changing lowland physiography, that include the effects of Global Change, compensation measures, costs and benefits, and the implications for long-term land-use options.

AB Oil palm plantations have expanded rapidly in recent decades. This large-scale land-use change has had great ecological, economic, and social impacts on both the areas converted to oil palm and their surroundings. However, research on the impacts of oil palm cultivation is scattered and patchy, and no clear overview exists. We address this gap through a systematic and comprehensive literature review of all ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations, including several (genetic, medicinal and ornamental resources, information functions) not included in previous systematic reviews. We compare ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations to those in forests, as the conversion of forest to oil palm is prevalent in the tropics. We find that oil palm plantations generally have reduced ecosystem functioning compared to forests: 11 out of 14 ecosystem functions show a net decrease in level of function. Some functions show decreases with potentially irreversible global impacts (e.g. reductions in gas and climate regulation, habitat and nursery functions, genetic resources, medicinal resources, and information functions). The most serious impacts occur when forest is cleared to establish new plantations, and immediately afterwards, especially on peat soils. To variable degrees, specific plantation management measures can prevent or reduce losses of some ecosystem functions (e.g. avoid illegal land clearing via fire, avoid draining of peat, use of integrated pest management, use of cover crops, mulch, and compost) and we highlight synergistic mitigation measures that can improve multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously. The only ecosystem function which increases in oil palm plantations is, unsurprisingly, the production of marketable goods. Our review highlights numerous research gaps. In particular, there are significant gaps with respect to socio-cultural information functions. Further, there is a need for more empirical data on the importance of spatial and temporal scales, such as differences among plantations in different environments, of different sizes, and of different ages, as our review has identified examples where ecosystem functions vary spatially and temporally. Finally, more research is needed on developing management practices that can offset the losses of ecosystem functions. Our findings should stimulate research to address the identified gaps, and provide a foundation for more systematic research and discussion on ways to minimize the negative impacts and maximize the positive impacts of oil palm cultivation.

AB The conformational impact of environmental biopolymers on metal sorption was studied through Cu sorption on xanthan. The apparent Cu2+ complexation constant (logK; Cu2+ + L- <-> CuL+) decreased from 2.9 +/- 0.1 at pH 3.5 to 2.5 +/- 0.1 at pH 5.5 (ionic strength I = 0.1). This behavior is in apparent contradiction with basic thermodynamics, as usually the higher the pH the more cations bind. Our combined titration, circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering study indicated that the change observed in Cu bond strength relates to a conformational change of the structure of xanthan, which generates more chelating sites at pH 3.5 than at pH 5.5. This hypothesis was validated by the fact that the Cu sorption constants on xanthan were always higher than those measured on a mixture of pyruvic and glucuronic acids (logK = 2.2), which are the two constitutive ligands present in the xanthan monomer. This study shows the role of the structural conformation of natural biopolymers in metal bond strength. This finding may help to better predict the fate of Cu and other metals in acidic environmental settings such as aquatic media affected by acid mine drainage, as well as peats and acidic soils, and to better define optimal conditions for bioremediation processes.

AB This paper describes the background of five palaeogeographical maps between the Marsdiep and the Weser River, and discusses the natural and anthropogenic processes driving the coastal changes during the last part of the Holocene. Before 2500 BC, during the first half of the Holocene, tidal basins were formed in the lower lying Pleistocene valley system as a result of the Holocene sea-level rise. The tidal basins were filled during the second half of the Holocene and on the deposits from the Pleistocene in the hinterland large coastal peat bogs developed. These peat bogs were vulnerable and sensitive to marine ingressions when the peat surface subsided due to drainage, compaction and erosion. During the Subatlantic (450 BC to present), the different ingression systems in the coastal area between Marsdiep and Weser had their own histories in timing and evolution. The ingressions were naturally caused by lateral migration of coastal barrier and tidal-inlet systems or by changes in the natural drainage system in the hinterland. From the Late Iron Age onwards, humans started to be the major cause of ingressions. By reclaiming and cultivating the seaward margins of coastal peat bogs, these areas subsided significantly and were flooded by high storm surges. When coastal areas were embanked during the historical period, the situation for the lower lying peat lands became more dramatic. When the sea dikes breached, the peat land was flooded, leading to casualties and huge material damages and loss of land. Drowning of the peat lands of the Jade and Dollard in the 14th and 15th centuries are examples of such catastrophes.

AB Blanket peat catchments are important biodiversity refugia. Key pressures on peatland catchment water bodies include artificial drainage, forestry, over-grazing, wind farm development and climate change, and assessment of these pressures requires sensitive monitoring programmes. This study, undertaken in two neighbouring blanket peat catchments, examined the variability in macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages and related indices in response to spatial and seasonal variability. Multivariate analysis revealed significant trends in the taxa distribution of both groups and the indices downstream and away from the constraining influence of the peat. However, the ecological quality ratios and status assessments for the associated water bodies were consistent irrespective of spatial variability in assemblages and raw indices. Significant seasonal trends emerged only in the macroinvertebrate assemblages and indices. This study contributes to the understanding of sources of uncertainty in ecological assessment and thus provides valuable information for the calibration of assessment protocols for sensitive peatland catchments.

AB Pristine peat soils are characterized by large porosity, low density and large water and organic matter contents. Drainage and management practices change peat properties by oxidation, compaction and mineral matter additions. This study examined differences in physical properties (hydraulic conductivity, water retention curve, bulk density, porosity, von Post degree of decomposition) in soil profiles of two peatland forests, a cultivated peatland, a peat extraction area and two pristine mires originally within the same peatland area. Soil hydraulic conductivity of the drained sites (median hydraulic conductivities: 3.3 x 10(-5) m/s, 2.9 x 10(-8) m/s and 8.5 x 10(-8) m/s for the forests, the cultivated site and the peat extraction area, respectively) was predicted better by land use option than by soil physical parameters. Detailed physical measurements were accompanied by monitoring of the water levels between drains. The model 'DRAINMOD' was used to assess the hydrology and the rapid fluctuations seen in groundwater depths. Hydraulic conductivity values needed to match the simulation of observed depth to groundwater data were an order of magnitude greater than those determined in field measurements, suggesting that macropore flow was an important pathway at the study sites. The rapid response of depth to groundwater during rainfall events indicated a small effective porosity and this was supported by the small measured values of drainable porosity. This study highlighted the potential role of land use and macropore flow in controlling water table fluctuation and related processes in peat soils.

AB The direct and indirect effects of iron on the structure and function of lotic ecosystems are reviewed. In addition to the mining of Fe enriched ores, intensified forestry, peat production and agricultural draining have increased the load of iron in many river ecosystems. The effects of iron on aquatic animals and their habitats are mainly indirect, although the direct toxic effects of Fe2+ are also important in some lotic habitats receiving Fe-enriched effluents in cold seasons, in particular. Ferric hydroxide and Fe-humus precipitates, on both biological and other surfaces, indirectly effect lotic organisms by disturbing the normal metabolism and osmoregulation, and by changing the structure and quality of benthic habitats and food resources. The combined direct and indirect effects of iron contamination decrease the species diversity and abundance of periphyton, benthic invertebrates and fishes. Sorption and co-precipitation of metals by Fe-oxides decrease the bioavailability and toxicity of water-borne metals, but may increase the dietary supply of metals and lead to toxic effects along the food chain. At the cellular level, Fe functions both as a detoxification mechanism, as well as a cell degeneration agent by inducing the formation of hydroxyl free radicals. More research is needed on the factors that affect the environmental fate and ecotoxicological impacts of iron on river ecosystems. As the flux of iron is heavily affected by seasonally varying physical, chemical and biological processes, its impact on ecosystems should be studied on multiple spatial, and temporal scales and at different levels of biological organisation.

AB To elucidate the roles of hydrology and vegetation in belowground carbon cycling within peatlands, radiocarbon values were obtained for pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CH4, and peat from the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatland. The major implication of this work is that the rate of microbial respiration within a peat column is greater than the peat decomposition rate. The radiocarbon content of DOC at both bog and fen was enriched relative to solid-phase peat by similar to 150-300 parts per thousand consistent with the advection of recently photosynthesized DOC downward into the peat column. Fen Delta C-14 values for DIC and CH4 closely track the Delta C-14 of pore water DOC at depth, indicating that this recent plant production was the predominant substrate for microbial respiration. Aceticlastic methanogenesis apparently dominated the upper third of the peat column (alpha = 1.05), shifting toward CO2 reduction with depth (1.05 < <alpha> < 1.08). Upwelling groundwater contributed as much as 15% of the DIC to the bulk DIC pool at depth in the fen. The similarity of <Delta>C-14 values for DIC and CH4 suggests that methanogens utilized DIC from this source as well as DIC produced in situ. Bog Delta C-14 values for pore water DIC and CH4 differ by less than or equal to 15 parts per thousand at all depths and are depleted in C-14 relative to DOC by similar to 100 parts per thousand, suggesting microbial utilization of a mixture of older and modern substrate. CO2 reduction was the primary pathway for methanogenesis at all depths in the bog (a = 1.08), and groundwater influence on bulk DIC was negligible. For bath sites, Delta C-14-DIC and Delta C-14-CH4 are approximately equal at depths where stable isotope data indicate a predominance of CO2 reduction and dissimilar when acetate fermentation is indicated.

AB Shallow water tables protect northern peatlands and their important carbon stocks from aerobic decomposition. Hydraulic conductivity, K, is a key control on water tables. The controls on K, particularly in degraded and restored peatlands, remain a subject of ongoing research. We took 29 shallow (50cm) peat cores from an estuarine raised bog in Wales, UK. Parts of the bog are in close-to-natural condition, while other areas have undergone shallow peat cutting for fuel and drainage, followed by restoration through ditch blocking. In the laboratory we measured horizontal (K-h) and vertical (K-v) hydraulic conductivity. We fitted linear multiple regression models to describe log(10)-transformed K-h and K-v on the basis of simple, easy-to-measure predictors. Dry bulk density and degree of decomposition were the strongest predictors of K-h and K-v. Perhaps surprisingly, the independent effect of hummocks was to produce higher-K-v peat than in lawns; while the independent effect of restored diggings was to produce higher-K peat than in uncut locations. Our models offer high explanatory power for K-h (adjusted r(2)=0.740) and K-v (adjusted r(2)=0.787). Our findings indicate that generalizable predictive models of peat K, similar to pedotransfer functions for mineral soils, may be attainable. K-h and K-v possess subtly different controls that are consistent with the contrasting roles of these two properties in peatland water budgets. Our near-surface samples show no evidence for the low-K marginal peat previously observed in deeper layers at the same site, indicating that such structures may be less important than previously believed.

AB A 1.8 m long core was retreated from Baijianghe mire in the west flank of Changbai Mountains of China in 2016. The peat sequence was dated by AMS C-14 and Pb-210/Cs-137 methods, showing a 1600-y depositional history. Based on the measured porosity, dry bulk density (DBD), TOC%, absorbance and plant macrofossil, we discuss the mire development and environmental change during the last 1600 years. The basin of Baijianghe Mire was a water-logged bottomland between 330 and 660 CE. A strong drought occurred during 530-600 CE caused lowering of water table which provided hydrological condition to form a peatland. We climate during 660-800 CE led to enhanced primary productivity and accumulation of plant remains, resulting rapidly development of the mire. Warm but fluctuating wetness conditions during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, 900-1150 CE) in the study area kept moderate development of the mire. Baijianghe Mire had the fastest development during 1200-1370 CE under relatively wetter and probably warm conditions. Low carbon accumulation of the mire appeared during the Lithe Ice Age (LIA, 1500-1850 CE) under cold and dry climates. From 1850 CE to 1945 CE, the climate turned to warm and wet. However, the peatland had experienced strong influence by human activity since 1945 CE. The peatland has gradually recovered from artificial drain since 1990s.

AB The Witwatersrand mining and industrial complex sprang up on the southern flank of the Witwatersrand watershed in 1886. Growth of the complex has been exponential. A pilot study was undertaken in peatlands formed along the Klip River, that drains the area, to assess the magnitude of the geochemical signature imparted by pollution arising from the complex. Carbon dating indicates that peat accumulation began in the study area more than 2500 years ago. The establishment of the Witwatersrand conurbation is clearly recorded in the peat in the form of rising concentrations of P, Cu, U, Hg, Cd, Ni, Co, Zn and Pb. Whilst seepage from mine tailings has contributed to pollution, the relative increases in heavy meta abundances suggest that industrial sources are probably equally important. Rapid rise in P abundance indicates a substantial contribution from domestic wastes. The growth of the conurbation was also accompanied by a 10-fold increase in the peat accumulation rate and a corresponding rise in the rate of erosional degradation in the catchment. Sequestration of metals by the peat has protected the Vaal River drainage system from extensive pollution, so that future protection of the wetland is essential.

AB The stable isotope N-15 was added as ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4 to throughfall water for one year, to study the fate of the deposited nitrogen at different levels of N deposition in two ''N saturated'' coniferous forests ecosystems in the Netherlands. The fate of the N-15 was followed at high-N (44-55 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and low-N (4-6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) deposition in plots established under transparent roofs build under the canopy in a Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest.
   The applied N-15 was detectable in needles and twigs, the soil and soil water leaching below the rooting zone (90 cm depth). Total N-15 recovery in major ecosystem compartments was 71-100% during two successive growing seasons after the start of a year-round N-15 application to throughfall-N. Nine months after the year-round N-15 application, the N-15 assimilated into tree biomass was 29-33% of the N-15 added in the Douglas fir stand and less than 17% in the Scots pine stand. At the same time total N-15 retention in the soil (down to 70 cm) of the high-N plots was about 37% of the deposited (NH4)-N-15-N, whereas 46% and 65% of the N-15 was found in the soil of the low-N deposition plots at the Douglas fir and Scots pine stand, respectively. The organic layers accounted for 60% of the N-15 retained in the soil. The total N deposition exceeded the demand of the vegetation and microbial immobilization. Total N-15 leaching losses within a year (below 90 cm) were 10-20% in the high-N deposition plots in comparison to 2-6% in the lowered nitrogen input plots. Relative retention in the soil and vegetation increased at lower N-input levels.
   Species differences in uptake and tree health seem to contribute to lower N-15 recoveries in the Scots pine trees compared to the Douglas fir trees. The excessive N deposition and resulting ''N saturation'' lead to conditions were the health and functioning of biota were negatively influenced. At decreased N deposition, lower leaching losses together with increased soil and plant retention indicated a change in the fate of the N deposited. This may have resulted from changes in ecosystem processes, and thus a shift along the continuum of N saturation to N limitation.

AB Water shortages occurring in the natural environment are the result of progressing climate changes, including the decreasing amount of atmospheric precipitation. In Poland, during the vegetation periods, droughts occur every 4-5 years, which causes losses in the field production and in forest communities. Reducing the negative effects of drought is possible by retention of water within a catchment. This method of improving the water balance has been included in the provisions of the Water Framework Directive and Water Law. On the meliorated valley objects, there are melioration devices that enable regulation of the moisture content, including irrigation during periods of drought. Drainage ditches can also retain water in the early spring periods with high flows in rivers. The studies carried out on the Lower Suprasl river site showed that about 40% of drainage devices used for water damming (dams and ramps), as well as for water distribution (feeders and detailed ditches) are not technically efficient and do not fulfil the function of moisture content regulation. Fibrous-muck soils occurring on this object, due to the lack of rainfall and irrigation, reduced the water retention capacity by approximately 30%. Modernization and reconstruction of drainage devices on valley objects will enable increasing the retention within individual catchments.

AB Background: Many minerotrophic fens in Central Europe have undergone similar sequences of land-use transformation. Drained and used as meadows or pastures for decades in the twentieth century, they were abandoned in the 1990s due to changes in agricultural economics. This sequence of land-use change has a severe impact on vegetation and is likely to initiate secondary succession and is possibly leading to an impoverishment in species diversity and to taxonomic homogenisation.
   Aims: We assess the impact of agricultural use and subsequent abandonment on vegetation composition in a percolation fen in north Germany and characterise successional changes and changes in abiotic site conditions.
   Methods: In 2010, we resampled 77 plots of a phytosociological survey from 1967-1970 in a lowland percolation mire complex in the lower Recknitz valley, north-east Germany. These included three characteristic vegetation types of percolation fens. To investigate and quantify vegetation changes we used dissimilarity measures, diversity metrics and ecological species indicator values.
   Results: Overall species richness declined only slightly while there was a more pronounced decrease in species richness at the plot level in all recorded vegetation types, resulting in increased beta diversity. Generalist and nitrophilous species increased in abundance, indicating ongoing succession.
   Conclusions: Drainage for agricultural use and subsequent abandonment has long-lasting effects. Altered hydrological and nutrient status of the fen soil has initiated secondary succession. There is indication of an extinction debt that in the future may lead to an impoverishment of species diversity in the area. Conservation of open mesotrophic fen species may thus only be achieved if moderate use is continued and hydrologic conservation measures are applied on wide contiguous areas.

AB Changes in species richness on a local scale are illustrated with an example of vegetation changes over 26 years in a species-rich fen meadow (Calthion palustris), which had been impacted by a deep drainage channel. The changes were monitored in the meadow as a whole and in 19 permanent plots situated in sites with various intensities of drainage. The similarity with an undisturbed local reference type of the hay meadow community was calculated for all. plots and every year. After 26 years, the overall loss of species in the meadow as a whole (including all ditches) was less than 12%, white the overal loss in species in the permanent plots was 45%. Several species that declined in the permanent plots had survived in the ditches, while others, in particular sedges had migrated to tow-tying areas. This example illustrates the need to survey changes in species richness on multiple scales. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All. rights reserved.

AB Many regulating ecosystem services exhibit non-excludability and non-rivalry characteristics akin to public goods. This makes it unlikely that such regulating ecosystem services will attract a price in the marketplace. Policymakers, therefore, find difficulties in determining a correct economic valuation for regulating ecosystem services, with potentially severe consequences for aligning policy for ecosystem service provision with public preferences for service delivery. This research used a choice modelling approach to estimate public preferences for delivery of two regulating ecosystem services; reductions in the flood risk to the British city of York (implemented by filling in drainage ditches in peat moorland further up the catchment), and a reduction in CO2 emissions (implemented by planting Poplar trees for biomass either locally in the study area or elsewhere in the UK). The choice experiment presented respondents with options providing different levels of CO2 reduction, implemented locally or nationally, and different levels of flood risk reduction, at a range of different prices, with a tax as the payment vehicle. Subsequent analysis with latent class (LC) models showed considerable heterogeneity of preference among respondents, particularly with regard to the location of tree planting for CO2 reduction. One LC segment showed a significant preference for achieving a high level CO2 reduction through national, as opposed to local tree planting, potentially indicating the existence of NIMBYism. The same LC segment displayed a preference for moderate reductions in the flood risk to York, even though this would deliver no personal benefit for a substantial proportion of the segment. This could, therefore, indicate altruistic behaviour towards geographically proximate beneficiaries.

AB Peat deposits occur in areas where water logging is common. Large areas of blanket mire occur throughout the temperate and cold regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and are particularly extensive in the UK Uplands. Mass movements of peat, reported usually as peat slides and bog bursts, have been well documented for over 150 years. However, the fundamental controls of this form of shallow instability are still poorly understood. The aim of this paper is to review critically the available evidence linking peat hydrology and slope instability. Then, using data from the North Pennine uplands in Northern England, we examine the importance of rainfall, macroscale drainage conditions and peat hydrological processes in initiating slope instability. Shear failure by loading, buoyancy effects, basal liquefaction and surface or marginal rupturing have all been proposed as potential failure mechanisms. Data from Northern England demonstrate that hydrological processes are fundamental in determining the spatial and temporal occurrence of peat slides. Most instabilities are associated with convective summer thunderstorms, although instances of rapid snowmelt and intense winter rainfall have also triggered these events. All instabilities occur in association with distinct drainage features. Slides are initiated along natural drainage lines or in association with artificial drainage often brought about by mining activity or agricultural practices. At the scale of the soil profile the special hydrological properties of peat, in particular shallow water tables and low soil hydraulic conductivity, offer important clues to failure mechanisms. Pore water pressures are generally low and vary little in the peat profile and throughout the year. It is clear from observations of subsurface flow that significant volumes of runoff reach considerable depths in the soil. Macropores (flow occurring in pores greater than 1 mm in diameter) are important in delivering surface runoff to deeper parts of the profile and in some instances high pipe water pressures may develop. These findings define several important hydrological controls for surficial mass movements in peat but the prospect of predicting the location and timing of such events is still a long way off.

AB Manual chamber campaigns are a versatile method to study management effects at plot scale in factorial experiments. The eddy covariance technique has the advantage of continuous measurements but it requires large homogeneous areas. By pairing the two techniques, the uncertainties of the CO2 fluxes modeled from the chamber campaigns can be quantified through cross-validation with the continuous eddy covariance data. This is particularly important in managed ecosystems with high temporal dynamics. At our agricultural site in Northern Germany, we installed both techniques in parallel for two crop cultivation periods, winter oilseed rape in 2012/13 and winter wheat in 2013/14. First, we compared measured net CO2 exchange (NEE) obtained from the closed chambers with the corresponding half-hourly fluxes from the eddy covariance technique. Despite largely different footprints and measurement windows, the measured fluxes were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.83 in 2012/13 and R-2 = 0.93 in 2013/14).
   Interpolating from chamber campaigns to the entire measurement period is commonly performed by modeling half-hourly fluxes based on non-linear regressions for photosynthesis and respiration. These modeled fluxes were compared to the fluxes measured with the eddy covariance technique. To understand the observed differences, we performed five modeling setups: 1) Non-linear regressions based algorithm with default settings, 2) non-linear regressions with expert settings, 3) purely empirical modeling with artificial neural networks, 4) cross-validation using eddy covariance measurements as campaign fluxes on original campaign days, and 5) cross-validation on weekly campaign days.
   The modeled seasonal course of daily NEE agreed well with the eddy covariance measurements for all five setups (R-2 from 0.77 to 0.92) but with periods of systematic offsets in the range of 5 g C m(-2) day(-1). Though the pattern of the offsets was different, all setups had comparable root mean square errors around 1.5 g C m(-2) day(-1) despite having opposite limitations. Cross-validation by simulating campaigns with artificial gaps from the continuous eddy dataset in setup 4) and 5) resulted in bias errors of around 0.4 g C m(-2) day(-1). This translates to a total uncertainty on annual NEE of around 175 g C m(-2) a(-1) purely from the modeling, i.e. the interpolation in-between campaigns. By leave-one-campaign-out scenarios, the sensitivity to single campaigns was examined. The mean effect on the annual total was higher for setup 4 (30 g C m(-2)) with the original number of campaigns than for setup 5 (9 g C m(-2)) with four times more campaigns. Furthermore, the interpolation in-between the campaigns can be improved by deriving vegetation proxies from the continuous eddy covariance measurements, such as an effective green area index (GAI) presented herein.

AB In 1978 the World Wide Fund for Nature in Finland, and the Finnish Museum of Natural History, established a "Margaritiferaworking group". During the last 18 years Margaritifera populations have been checked in more than 60 rivers in different parts of Finland and in some rivers in Russian Karelia and Estonia. Altogether we have inventoried about 2000 km of underwater research transects. The best method of restoring the freshwater pearl mussel population is the protection of the breeding population. Altogether eleven Margaritifera rivers belong to the new Finnish Natura 2000-network. In 1995 the Ministry of Environment gave financial values to every protected animal and plant species in Finland (confiscation value). The confiscation value of a single M. margaritifera specimen in Finland is 3500 FIM (about pound 500). In the last decades the main threat to Margaritifera has been the drainage of peat lands and wet forest. One method to prevent the flow of silt into a mussel river has been to stop the ditching short of the river but dig pools for silt deposition. In restoring the old timber floating rivers to ones suitable for salmon, a so called soft technique, has been developed in Finland. By using this technique it has also been possible to prepare the river bed for freshwater pearl mussels. Glochidiosis can have a severe impact on trout in fish farms such that new installations must not be located in downstream proximity of important mussel populations. The farming of rainbow trout in natural rivers leads to the partial reduction of the native brown trout and consequently to the loss of Margaritifera glochidia as they cannot encyst on the gills of the rainbow trout. In some Margaritifera rivers where density of salmonid fish is low, the host fish population has been increased up to 0.5-1 specimens/m(2). The restocking of freshwater pearl mussel populations by transplantation has been the last choice of conservation measures in Finland. After 16 years a success rate of over 90% has been achieved, where mussels have been transferred to other parts of the same river, but only 50% or less in cases where mussels have been transferred from one river to another It has also been very important to encourage research on all aspects of the biology and geographical distribution of the freshwater pearl mussel, and to promote co-ordination of survey and research programmes at national and international levels.

AB Shrubs and herbal wetland stands have a very important influence on microclimatic conditions and short water cycling. However, they have received very little attention. This study concerns with the role of willow and peaty meadow stands and a mesic pasture ill their ability to affect both the temperature and energy regime. Our results showed that the pattern of daily temperatures (diurnal variation and temperature amplitudes) were more balanced ill the wetland stands than in the pasture. The most attenuated and stable temperatures were measured in the willow stands whereas the fastest warming of the soil substrate occurred in the peat meadow. Temperature amplitudes and differences in daily average temperatures on the stand surfaces increased with decreasing air humidity. Thermographic camera pictures showed that in the peaty meadow the means of stand surface temperatures as well as daily temperature oscillations were higher than in the willow stand. Although no significant statistical differences were found, daily time series of the Bowen ratio showed an increase towards midday in the willow stand. This was presumably the result of a midday depression of transpiration. We determined that more solar energy was converted into latent heat than into sensible heat in both wetland stands. Therefore we suggest that these wetland stands function in the landscape as functional dissipative ecological units.

AB Bog systems tend to have a flashy hydrological regime with low baseflows and rapid and high storm peaks. Water derived from peatlands often contains significant amounts of organic humic and fulvic materials which form the largest fraction of the dissolved organic carbon component of the fluvial carbon flux. However, most estimates of dissolved organic carbon flux from peatlands are based on sampling that is infrequent and which may miss the periods of high flux during storm events. In order to better characterize the behaviour and fluxes of fluvial carbon it is necessary to operate more frequent sampling. This paper presents data from a continuously operating field-based spectrophotometer simultaneously measuring absorbance across 200-730 nm at 2.5 nm intervals in runoff from an upland peatland stream. It is shown that absorbance at different wavelengths that have previously been used to characterize dissolved organic carbon varies rapidly during storm events. The probe is shown to even detect changes in absorbance characteristics in response to rainfall events before the stream discharge starts to rise. The high-resolution behaviour of absorbance characteristics during storm events is different depending on the wavelength studied. Thus, the choice of wavelength used as a proxy for dissolved organic carbon needs careful attention and it may be that automated spectrophotometric methods which provide rich time-series data from across the spectrum can tell us more about fluxes, processes and sources of aquatic carbon in peatland systems in the future than traditional practices have hitherto allowed.

AB Coastal wetlands are characterized by continued human influence, e.g. with drainage ditches, coastal dikes or landscape restoration. In addition, it is important to understand the complex interactions with the sea to predict impacts of further development. In the present study the aim was to analyze surface and subsurface flow in a coastal wetland located at the Baltic Sea coastline near Warnemunde (Germany) to quantify water exchange with the Baltic Sea and analyze the effect of a storm flood event on saline intrusion. A 3-D transient groundwater model and a one-dimensional surface water model were set up and calibrated by using hydraulic head measurements. The results indicate that in addition to ditch flow, groundwater discharge to the Baltic Sea often has a significant influence on the overall water budget of the fen. From the transient modelling it became evident that water exchange between groundwater in the fen and the Baltic Sea depends on sea level and very often fluctuates between seaward and landward flow directions on daily to weekly time scales.

AB Peat plateaus are important landscape features of many high-boreal, wetland-dominated drainage basins. Raised up to 2 m above the surrounding landscape and underlain by permafrost, these forested peatlands provide meltwater drainage to the surrounding wetlands, and to basin runoff. Understanding the factors that control the volume and timing of runoff from peat plateaus is the essential first step towards developing methods of accurately predicting basin runoff from wetland-dominated basins in the region of discontinuous permafrost, as well as understanding the basin response to hydrological changes brought on by the thermal degradation and thaw of permafrost peatlands. In this study, a water balance approach and the Dupuit-Forchheimer equation were used to quantify sub-surface runoff from a forested peat plateau at Scotty Creek, a small (152 km(2)), wetlanddominated discontinuous permafrost basin in Northwest Territories, Canada. These two computations yielded similar results in both years of study (2004-2005), and showed that runoff accounted for approximately half of the moisture loss from the peat plateau, most of which occurred in response to snowmelt inputs. The melt of ground ice was also a significant source of water during the study periods, which was largely detained in soil storage. Soil moisture conditions prior to soil freezing were a major factor controlling the volume of runoff from the hillslope. Sub-surface drainage rates declined dramatically after the snowmelt runoff period, when the majority of water inputs went to soil storage and evapotranspiration. The minimal lag between rain events and hydrograph response in both years suggests that much of the runoff produced from rain events is rapidly transported to the adjacent wetlands. These results give insight into how current climate warming predictions for northern latitudes could affect the hydrological response of forested peat plateaus, and the basins which they occupy.

AB Palaeoecological studies (including analysis of pollen, macrofossils, geochemistry, and AMS radiocarbon dates) of four peat sections from one low-centred ice-wedge polygon in NE Yakutia (NE Siberia) allow the three-dimensional reconstruction of polygon development during the last ca 1250 years. After drainage of a lake, peat forming vegetation invaded rapidly. Comparison with palaeotemperature data shows that the initial formation of mature ridges coincided with a period of high summer temperatures around AD 1400. The ridges persisted and expanded during the subsequent colder ca 200 years. Partial collapse of various ridges at the end of the 18th century corresponded to a phase with low summer temperatures. During the warm, 20th century one collapsed ridge regenerated, whereas another persisted in its collapsed state. Ice-wedge polygons are, thus, complex and highly dynamic ecosystems, in which changes in temperature and precipitation may induce rapid ecological changes by the complex interplay of water, ice and vegetation. Our study indicates that global warming associated with a decrease in summer precipitation may initially result in enhanced polygon ridge formation. The combination of longer summers and increased winter precipitation, as predicted for high latitudes will, however, eventually result in larger meltwater input in the polygon mires, which may cause the (partial) collapse of polygon ridges and underlying ice-wedges.

AB Amplification of global warming in Arctic and boreal regions is causing significant changes to permafrost-affected landscapes. The nature and extent of the change is complicated by ecological responses that take place across strong gradients in environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Emerging remote sensing techniques based on a growing array of satellite and airborne platforms that cover a wide range of spatial and temporal scales increasingly allow robust detection of changes in permafrost landscapes. In this review, we summarise recent developments (2010-15) in remote sensing applications to detect and monitor landscape changes involving surface temperatures, snow cover, topography, surface water, vegetation cover and structure, and disturbances from fire and human activities. We then focus on indicators of degrading permafrost, including thermokarst lakes and drained lake basins, thermokarst bogs and fens, thaw slumps and active-layer detachment slides, thermal erosion gullies, thermokarst pits and troughs, and coastal erosion and flooding. Our review highlights the expanding sensor capabilities, new image processing and multivariate analysis techniques, enhanced public access to data and increasingly long image archives that are facilitating novel insights into the multi-decadal dynamics of permafrost landscapes. Remote sensing methods that appear especially promising for change detection include: repeat light detection and ranging, interferometric synthetic aperture radar and airborne geophysics for detecting topographic and subsurface changes; temporally dense analyses at high spatial resolution; and multi-sensor data fusion. Remotely sensed data are also becoming used more frequently as driving parameters in permafrost model and mapping schemes. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Utricularia intermedia Hayne, U. ochroleuca R.W. Hartm., U. stygia Thor and U. bremii Heer ex Kolliker (Lentibulariaceae, Lamiales) are the four rarest and critically endangered European Utricularia (bladderwort) species from the generic section Utricularia. They are aquatic, submerged or amphibious carnivorous plants with suction traps which grow in very shallow, standing dystrophic (humic) waters such as pools in peat bogs and fens (also pools after peat or fen extraction), shores of peaty lakes and fishponds; U. bremii also grows in pools in old shallow sand-pits. These Utricularia species with boreal circumpolar distribution (except for U. bremii) are still commonly growing in northern parts of Europe (Scandinavia, Karelia) but their recent distribution in Central Europe is scarce to very rare following a marked population decline over the last 120 years. All species have very thin linear shoots with short narrow to filamentous leaves bearing carnivorous traps (bladders, utricles) 1-5 mm large. The first three species form distinctly dimorphic shoots differentiated into pale carnivorous ones bearing most or all traps, and green photosynthetic shoots with only a few (or without) traps, while the last species usually forms non-differentiated (monomorphic) or slightly differentiated shoots. The plants exhibit a marked physiological polarity along their linear shoots with rapid apical shoot growth. Their very high relative growth rate is in harmony with the record-high net photosynthetic rate of their photosynthetic shoots. Flowering of these species is common under favourable conditions and is stimulated by high temperatures but only U. intermedia sets seeds; the other species are sterile due to pollen malformation. Some molecular-taxonomic studies indicate that U. ochroleuca and U. stygia might be hybrids between U. intermedia and U. minor. All species propagate mainly vegetatively by regular branching and reach high relative growth rates under favourable conditions. All species form spherical dormant winter buds (turions). Suction traps actively form negative pressures of ca. -0.22 to -0.25 bar. The traps are physiologically very active organs with intensive metabolism: as a result of the presence of abundant glands inside the traps, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from captured prey carcasses (quadrifid glands) or take part in pumping water out of the traps and producing negative pressure (bifid glands), their aerobic respiration rate is ca. 2-3 times higher (per unit biomass) than that of leaves. Although oxygen concentrations inside reset traps are (almost) zero, traps are inhabited by many microscopic organisms (bacteria, euglens, algae, ciliates, rotifers, fungi). These commensal communities create a functional food web and in traps with captured macroscopic prey, they act as digestive mutualists and facilite prey digestion. Traps secrete a great amount of organic substances (sugars, organic acids, aminoacids) to support these commensals ('gardening'). Yet the nutritional role of commensals in prey-free traps is still unclear. Quadrifid glands can also serve in the reliable determination of three species. Ecological requirements of U. intermedia, U. ochroleuca and U. stygia are very similar and include very shallow dystrophic waters (0-30 cm deep) with highly variable levels of dystrophy, common mild water level fluctuations, oligomesotrophic to slighly eutrophic waters, optimal pH values from 5.5 to 7.0 but always high free-CO2 concentrations of 0.8-1.5 mM. Limited data indicate that U.
   bremii is partly a stenotopic species preferring only slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6-7), very soft to slightly hard, oligo-mesotrophic waters. Yet it can grow well both in strongly dystrophic and clear waters, in peat bogs as well as sand-pits over peaty soil and clayish sand. Longterm, very low water levels in combination with habitat eutrophication, whatever the reason, leading to peat bog and fen infilling, are the most common and unfavourable ecological threads at the most sites of the four rare Utricularia species. However, ecological consequences of high-water level at the sites can be ambiguous for the populations: it reduces the strongly competitive cyperoid and graminoid species but can speed up site eutrophication. All four species are considered (critically) threatened in European countries and are usually under official species protection or their sites are protected. Regeneration of infilled fens or peat bogs and creation of shallow fen pools and canals in these mires, combined with (re)-introductions of these species have shown to be a very successful and efficient measure to protect the natural populations for many decades. Old shallow sand-pit pools have become outstanding substitution habitats for the protection of U. bremii.

AB Peatlands encode information about past vegetation dynamics, climate, and microbial processes. Here, we used delta N-15 and delta C-13 patterns from 16 peat profiles to deduce how the biogeochemistry of the Marcell S1 forested bog in northern Minnesota responded to environmental and vegetation change over the past similar to 10 000 years. In multiple regression analyses, delta N-15 and delta C-13 correlated strongly with depth, plot location, C/N, %N, and each other. Correlations with %N, %C, C/N, and the other isotope accounted for 80% of variance for delta N-15 and 38% of variance for delta C-13, reflecting N and C losses. In contrast, correlations with depth and topography (hummock or hollow) reflected peatland successional history and climate. Higher delta N-15 in plots closer to uplands may reflect upland-derived DON inputs and accompanying shifts in N dynamics in the lagg drainage area surrounding the bog. The Suess effect (declining delta(CO2)-C-13 since the Industrial Revolution) lowered delta C-13 in recent surficial samples. High delta N-15 from -35 to -55 cm probably indicated the depth of ectomycorrhizal activity after tree colonization of the peatland over the last 400 years, as confirmed by the occasional presence of wood down to -35 cm depth. High delta C-13 at similar to 4000 years BP (-65 to -105 cm) could reflect a transition at that time to slower rates of peat accumulation, when C-13 discrimination during peat decomposition may increase in importance. Low delta C-13 and high delta N-15 at -213 and -225 cm (similar to 8500 years BP) corresponded to a warm period during a sedge-dominated rich fen stage. The above processes appear to be the primary drivers of the observed isotopic patterns, whereas there was no clear evidence for methane dynamics influencing delta C-13 patterns.

AB Plant boron (B) status is known to affect plant secondary metabolites but most studies have been short termed and in controlled environments. Copper (Cu) effects on phenolics are better known at toxic than at low levels. Here, the chemistry of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles was studied 20 years after fertilisation with B and Cu in a long-term field experiment on a drained boreal peatland.
   Phenolic compounds were analysed from three needle year classes using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and condensed tannins with modified acid-butanol assay. Monoterpenes in the youngest needles were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
   Needle B concentrations were at deficient level in controls (5.7 mu g g(-1)), but at the optimum level (12 mu g g(-1)) still 20 years after fertilisation. Copper concentrations were low but not deficient (4.0 mu g g(-1) in unfertilised, 4.8 mu g g(-1) in fertilised). Needle ageing increased the concentrations of individual phenolics in most cases, but decreased the concentration of condensed tannins. The concentrations of several individual phenolics were reduced by B fertilisation compared to B-deficient control, significantly in the cases of (+)-catechin and a neolignan. The concentrations of eight compounds and the sum of small-molecule phenolics were higher in Cu fertilised trees. Condensed tannins and monoterpenes were not affected by the micronutrients.
   Boron and copper additions affected mostly the same phenolic compounds, but B decreased while Cu increased their concentrations, Cu effects being clearer. The higher phenolic concentrations in B deficient trees were not likely large enough to explain leader dieback in B-deficient trees. The effects and interactions of these micronutrients need to be further studied in field conditions to establish firstly if the changes in phenolics are consistent among species, and secondly what mechanisms lead to the changes. Although small, the changes in phenolic concentrations may affect the interactions of the trees with their biotic and abiotic environment, when consistent over many years.

AB Mineral roads in peatlands change the nature of the substrate, influence the water table level of the peatland on either side of the road and the physicochemical characteristics of the water and peat. These changes can in turn affect plant community composition. The efficiency of an innovative and affordable method for the restoration of peatlands impacted by roads was evaluated: the Burial Under Peat Technique. To be considered effective from an ecological point of view, the technique should meet restoration goals by 1) confining the chemical elements and compounds potentially leaching from the mineral material; 2) creating and maintaining a restored surface elevation similar to the adjacent peatland for optimal rewetting; and 3) re-establishing typical peatland vegetation communities. Three years post-restoration, water sampled at various depths and distances to the buried road presented chemical elements and compounds concentrations similar to the means measured in the pristine surrounding peatland for most of the ions analyzed. The different steps of the technique ensured the reestablishment of an elevation similar to the surrounding peatland. The return of peatland plant communities was slow, mainly due to local factors (e.g., presence of drainage ditches). Furthermore, the Burial Under Peat Technique fulfilled the restoration objectives in re-establishing an acid organic soil. Finally, it is a cost-effective method in comparison to completely removing the mineral material and transporting new material to fill the depression left by the excavation of the road.

AB This study aimed to adapt the Water Quality Index of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME WQI) for its application to water quality assessment of drainage water and watercourses downstream of peat harvesting operations. It integrates different parameters that potentially reflect the overall water quality condition of a stream. Thus, it is calculated using multivariate water quality data and accounts for their conformity with respect to water quality guidelines. Adaptation of the index proceeded to identify, through a literature review, the physico-chemical parameters that may change due to peat harvesting. The CCME WQI was used to compare water quality of receiving watercourses to that of streams located within a 200 km radius from the study sites in three regions of Quebec. The availability of water quality data guided the selection of parameters among those identified. They are ammonia, conductivity, pH and suspended sediment concentrations. Results indicated a significant difference between WQI values of water from harvested peatlands and those of streams in two of the three regions studied. Results have also shown that it is the pH guideline that is not respected in most cases for harvested peatlands.

AB Many upland catchments in the UK have undergone afforestation; their characteristic waterlogged soils require extensive pre-plantation ground drainage to allow tree establishment. In peatland areas this can result in very highly coloured runoff and enhanced dissolved organic matter (DOM) export in rivers of naturally high concentrations. In 1966, the Coalburn Experimental Catchment, northern England, was established to investigate the impact of afforestation on an upland peat catchment. Here we report the variations in DOM spectrophotometric properties of streamflow in the catchment at canopy closure, especially with respect to potential carbon sources within the artificial drainage ditches. Drainage ditches are characterized by water that has higher absorption coefficients and which is more highly coloured than in the catchment tributaries. Ditched, afforested areas produce more highly-coloured runoff waters that are more fluorescent and absorbent normalized to carbon concentration compared to ditches in open moorland. Ditches that had been experimentally re-excavated have organic matter of different spectrophotometric character, with higher dissolved organic carbon concentration and less aromatic or lower molecular weight material. It is hypothesized that this is due to the exposure of bare peat faces within and adjacent to the ditches that are more susceptible to drying compared to vegetated areas. The large extent of this drainage network acts as both a rapid transport network increasing hydrological connectivity and a pool for the storage of DOM, which is of different spectrophotometric character under low flow conditions, depending on management conditions.

Using an extensive collection of historical documents, as well as dendrochronological data, we reconstructed the history of the peatland. We also sampled vegetation and environmental variables, and integrated the data in a geographic information system. More than 60% of the total area of the bog was mined between 1942 and 1975, and 98 km of ditches were dug to drain the site. The peatland lost 34% of its initial peat volume between 1946 and 1998. Although the bog was severely disturbed, the spontaneous revegetation of the site by vascular plants was successful (90%-100% cover). However, only 10% of the total mined area has been recolonized by Sphagnum species, mainly because drainage ditches are still operational and contribute to drying out the bog. Water table level, peat deposit thickness, and pH are abiotic factors strongly influencing the vegetation composition in the bog. Spatial and historical factors are also important components in this study since they explain, either alone or in interaction with abiotic factors, 44% of the variation of the species data. The intensity of mining activities and the pattern of abandonment of mined sectors strongly influenced abiotic factors, which in turn affected the revegetation process. Even if the Sphagnum cover of the bog is low, the rapid "recovery" of the vegetation cover in the peatland indicates that after the reestablishment of an appropriate hydrological regime, a highly disturbed peatland has a considerable potential for regeneration.

AB In the twentieth century, there have been increases in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) coverage on peatlands in southern Sweden. In order to assess possible links to contemporary climate change; aerial photograph analysis and dendrochronology were combined to study recent pine cover changes at Anebymossen, a raised peat bog in south central Sweden. Multi-temporal analyses of three sets of panchromatic images from 1950 to 1993 showed a 30% increase of the marginal pine forest of the raised bog during that time, where a significant increase had occurred in the eastern part. Dendrochronological analyses were performed in two parts: the eastern part and the western part where the increase in pine coverage was considerably lower. The tree-ring growth patterns disclosed that a major event, most likely drainage, had occurred at Anebymossen in 1927, affecting tree growth at both sites. The effect of the drainage, which lowers the local ground-water table and hence promotes tree growth, was growth surges with a doubling of the annual increment rates. The effect was short lived in the western part, but continuous drainage in the eastern part caused growth enhancement until the beginning of the 1980s. We suggest that rather than being caused by climate change, the increase in pine coverage on Anebymossen was initiated by the considerable drainage in 1927. Since most peatlands in southern Sweden have been affected by anthropogenic activities, we suggest that it is difficult to make climatological interpretations of tree cover changes on peatlands using only aerial photograph analyses.

   DRAINMOD MODELING; PEAT MINING; AGRICULTURE
AB Land development activities such as agriculture, clear cutting, peat mining, and the planting of forest plantations on wetlands can affect the hydrologic behavior of these ecosystems by affecting their water storage and release patterns on the landscape. The effects of these development activities on hydrologic fluxes in peatlands (Typic Medisaprists) were compared to the effects of forest management practices in North Carolina using a field-tested hydrologic simulation model (DRAINMOD). Simulations revealed that natural peat-based (Histosol) pocosin systems lose 66% (80 cm) of the 123 cm of average annual rainfall by evapotranspiration (ET) and 34% (42 cm/yr) via annual runoff. Annual runoff values were 63 cm/yr for peat mining areas, 48 cm/yr for cleared peatlands, 46 cm/yr for peatlands converted to agriculture and 34 cm/yr for pine plantations, once the forest canopy is closed. Thus, these wetland alterations, except for forestry, significantly increased runoff and decreased ET compared to the natural ecosystem. Forest pine plantation management decreased runoff and increased ET. A case study of the effects of forest management practices was reviewed for a 15-year-old drained loblolly pine plantation growing on fine sandy loam soils (Thermic Typic umbraquults) in the coastal plains of North Carolina. Forestry activities such as thinning (i.e., reduced leaf area index by 50%) decreased ET and canopy interception and nearly doubled drainage loss (38 cm/yr to 60 cm/ yr). Commonly applied forest practices, such as drainage, increased the average number of flow events with flows > 5 mm/day to 86 days per year from 26 days per year under natural conditions.

AB With respect to their role in the global carbon cycle, natural peatlands are characterized by their ability to sequester atmospheric carbon. This trait is strongly connected to the water regime of these ecosystems. Large parts of the soil profile in natural peatlands are water saturated, leading to anoxic conditions and to a diminished decomposition of plant litter. In functioning peatlands, the rate of carbon fixation by plant photosynthesis is larger than the decomposition rate of dead organic material. Over time, the amount of carbon that remains in the soil and is not converted back to carbon dioxide grows. Land use of peatlands often goes along with water level manipulations and thereby with alterations of carbon flux dynamics. In this study, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux measurements from a bog site in northwestern Germany that has been heavily degraded by peat mining are presented. Two contrasting types of management have been implemented at the site: (1) drainage during ongoing peat harvesting on one half of the central bog area and (2) rewetting on the other half that had been taken out of use shortly before measurements commenced. The presented 2-year data set was collected with an eddy covariance (EC) system set up on a central railroad dam that divides the two halves of the (former) peat harvesting area. We used footprint analysis to split the obtained CO2 and CH4 flux time series into data characterizing the gas exchange dynamics of both contrasting land use types individually. The time series gaps resulting from data division were filled using the response of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to environmental variables, footprint variability, and fuzzy transformations of seasonal and diurnal cyclicity. We used the gap-filled gas flux time series from 2 consecutive years to evaluate the impact of rewetting on the annual vertical carbon balances of the cutover bog. Rewetting had a considerable effect on the annual carbon fluxes and led to increased CH4 and decreased CO2 release.
   The larger relative difference between cumulative CO2 fluxes from the rewetted (13 +/- 6 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (22 +/- 7 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section occurred in the second observed year when rewetting apparently reduced CO2 emissions by 40 %. The absolute difference in annual CH4 flux sums was more similar between both years, while the relative difference of CH4 release between the rewetted (0.83 +/- 0.15 mol m(-2) a(-1)) and drained (0.45 +/- 0.11 mol m(-2) a(-1)) section was larger in the first observed year, indicating a maximum increase in annual CH4 release of 84% caused by rewetting at this particular site during the study period.

AB A protected area network should ensure the maintenance of biodiversity. Because of climate change, species ranges are expected to move polewards, causing further demand for the protected area network to be efficient in preserving biota. We compared population changes of different bird species groups according to their habitat preferences in boreal protected areas in Finland on the basis of large-scale censuses carried out in 1981-1999 and in 2000-2009. Population densities of common forest habitat generalists remained the same between the two periods, while densities of species of conservation concern showed contrasting trends: species preferring old-growth forests increased, but those living on mires and wetlands, and species of Arctic mountains decreased. These trends are most probably connected with climate change, but successional changes in protected areas and regional habitat alteration should also be taken into account. Of species preferring old-growth forests, a larger proportion are southern than among species of mires and wetlands, or of Arctic mountains, most or all of which, respectively, had a northerly distribution. In general, northern species have decreased and southern increased with the exception of northern species of old-growth forests which had not declined. On the other hand, bird species of mires and wetlands decreased also in the northernmost protected areas although mires had not been drained in the region in contrast with southern and central Finland thus indicating that regional-scale direct habitat loss did not cause the decline of these species in the north. It is suggested that climate change effects on species in natural boreal and Arctic habitats most probably are habitat-specific with large differences in response times and susceptibility.

AB Analytical electron microscopy was used to characterize aquatic iron-rich colloids. We focused our attention on a redox transition medium in the drainage water of a peat soil. In the anoxic peat water, observations by transmission electron microscopy and associated energy dispersive analyses (TEM-EDS) highlight the presence of spherical entities (similar to100-600 nm), containing only traces of iron. The increase of dissolved oxygen concentration favours the formation of iron oxy(hydr)oxides. In the oxygenated drain, particles with the same morphology and size range are present. Statistical TEM-EDS analyses show that they represent the only colloidal form of iron in the drain samples. Nevertheless, although Fe-K peaks appear clearly on EDS spectra, the proportion of iron in these colloids reaches at most 4% at. (whereas C + O > 90% at.). Structural information completes this study. Both electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) reveal the disparity between element distributions within the drain entities. Iron and calcium are preferably distributed on the outer sphere of the particle, whereas carbon and oxygen follow the theoretical variation of the signal intensity within a plain sphere. The implication of organic matter as nucleation site for iron precipitation is spectacularly demonstrated by the presence of nanometre-sized iron-rich phases highlighted by EELS line scans.

AB Peatlands occupy a relatively small fraction of the Earth's land area, but they are a globally important carbon store because of their high carbon density. Undisturbed peatlands are currently a weak carbon sink (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a moderate source of methane (CH4; similar to 0.03 Pg CH4 y(-1)), and a very weak source of nitrous oxide (N2O; similar to 0.00002 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). Anthropogenic disturbance, primarily agriculture and forestry drainage (10%-20% of global peatlands), results in net CO2 emissions, reduced CH4 emissions, and increased N2O emissions. This likely changes the global peatland greenhouse gas balance to a C source (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a 10% smaller CH4 source, and a larger (but still small) N2O source (similar to 0.0004 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). There is no strong evidence that peatlands significantly contributed to 20th century changes in the atmospheric burden of CO2, CH4, or N2O; will this picture change in the 21st century? A review of experimental and observational studies of peatland dynamics indicates that the main global change impacts on peatlands that may have significant climate impacts are (1) drainage, especially in the tropics; (2) widespread permafrost thaw; and (3) increased fire intensity and frequency as a result of drier climatic conditions and (or) drainage. Quantitative estimates of global change impacts are limited by the sparse field data (particularly in the tropics), the large variability present in existing data, uncertainties in the future trajectory of peatland use, interactive effects of individual impacts, and the unprecedented rates of climate change expected in the 21st century.

AB Wetlands are important dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoirs, and principal sources of DOC to the fluvial environment, constituting a significant linkage between land and ocean in the context of global carbon cycle. The Sanjiang Plain, a floodplain in Northeastern China that encompasses numerous natural freshwater wetlands, has been experiencing extensive building of drainage ditches and thus elevated degradation of wetlands. This paper investigated DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved total carbon (DTC) in soil, the surface ponding and rivers from natural wetlands and the degraded wet-land, and also in an artificial drainage ditch in the Sanjiang Plain during the growing season (May to October) of 2009. Seasonal averaged DOC concentrations were greater in soil and the surface ponding of the degraded riparian wetland than those originating from the natural riparian wetlands (i.e. Bielahong, Yalv and Nongjiang riparian wetlands). Seasonal averaged DIC concentrations in the surface ponding of the degraded wetland increased by 1.76, 0.59 and 2.05 times, compared to those in the Bielahong, Yalv and Nongjiang riparian wetlands, respectively. Similar to dissolved carbon dynamics in the field sites, the seasonal averaged DOC concentration in the degraded marshy river showed higher value (10.36 +/- 1.99 mg/L), compared to those in the pristine marshy rivers. Seasonal DIC concentrations followed a trend as the degraded marshy river (15.09 +/- 2.43 mg/L) - the artificial ditch (12.52 +/- 1.61 mg/L) - pristine marshy rivers on average (8.53 +/- 0.96 mg/L). Seasonal mean DTC concentration in the artificial ditch showed higher values than that in the natural marshy rivers, while seasonal mean DTC concentration in the degraded marshy river was greater than that in the artificial ditch. Further, seasonal DOC and DIC dynamics were similar in the artificial ditch and the degraded marshy river. These qualitative changes in the dissolved carbon dynamics in our study might have important implications that the impact of building of artificial ditches on dissolved carbon of waters more fully reflected in increases of dissolved carbon resulting from wetland degradation rather than increases in the artificial ditch itself.

AB Anthropogenic deposition of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) contributes substantially to soil acidity in some forest regions and hence studies have focused on modeling and quantifying depositions in landscapes. The resulting acidity can change the soil chemical balance, nutrient availability, microbial communities, and at a broader scale, ecosystem functioning. In this study, a 16S PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) approach was used to measure the bacterial diversity and identify the dominant bacterial species along a soil acidity gradient in high elevation spruce-fir forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). Sample sites were selected based upon modeled S deposition class (6-14, 15-23, 23-32, and 33-41 kg ha(-1)). Collected soils were analyzed for pH, C, N, Ca, Al, S, CEC, and base saturation. Average soil pH in the O, A, and B horizons were 3.6, 3.6 and 3.9, respectively. Modeled S deposition was found to be an unreliable predictor of soil S content as well as most other soil chemical properties. DGGE profiles of bacterial partial 16S rRNA genes revealed minor differences in bacterial diversity while communities were similar, dominated by members of phylum Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Dominance of acidophilic bacterial species, often found in highly acidic environment such as acid-mine drainage and sphagnum bogs, suggests that the poorly buffered soils that are endemic to southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests are saturated with acidity. Our results suggest that stricter air quality standards have not resulted in shift to less acid-tolerant bacteria. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The water chemistry, including major ions and dissolved carbon of Jiulongjiang River in SE China, were determined to examine the distributions and variations of dissolved carbon species. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations in the river water were within the range of 7.50 to 49.04 mg/L (averaged 22.12 mg/L) in the wet season and from 8.83 to 84.91 mg/L (averaged 41.17 mg/L) in the dry season. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied from 0.54 to 2.89 mg/L (averaged 1.04 mg/L) in the wet season and from 1.34 to 3.56 mg/L (averaged 2.34 mg/L) in the dry season. The concentrations of DIC were comparable among the three tributaries, whereas the DOC was significantly higher in the Xixi River and Nanxi River than the Beixi River. The calculations employing the mass balance method indicated that weathering process and anthropogenic inputs played an important role in the dissolved carbon production in the Jiulongjiang watershed. The DOC exhibited significant correlations with the rural area whereas the DIC did not show any significant correlations with land-use types, indicating that the DOC was closely related to agricultural activities. The carbon export fluxes from the Jiulongjiang River were calculated based on the discharge data. The DIC-C export reached to 1.2 x 10(5)t/y, whereas the DOC-C export was nearly 3.2 x 10(4)t/y. In addition, seasonal variation of carbon exports had been observed; because of the large water discharge in the wet season, more DIC and DOC were transported from the Jiulongjiang River in the wet season than in the dry season. The source analysis demonstrated natural processes account for the majority of carbon exports.

AB Eurasian permafrost serves as an important carbon pool and water resource for linked aquatic ecosystems. To investigate the effects of expected warmer climate under climate change, and also to fill the data gaps in the south margin of the Eurasian permafrost, the seasonal runoff and the associated dissolved carbon fluxes in a pair of catchments in the Great Khingan Mountains of northeast China were investigated in 2018-2019. Two similar small catchments, a south-facing (SF) and a north-facing (NF), were used to check the effects of warmer climate on the dynamics of runoff and dissolved carbon yields. The SF catchment, with a warmer condition compared to the NF catchment, presented much larger snowmelt runoff during spring and more gentle rainfall flood peaks in the summer-autumn period, but similar concentrations of dissolved carbons during both the periods. As a result, the dissolved carbon fluxes were greatly elevated during the snowmelt period. However, the runoff and carbon yield in the two catchments showed no significant difference during the summer rainfall periods, in spite of a much deeper active layer of permafrost in the SF. As indicated by two fluorescence indices, the humification (HIX) and biological index (BIX), the chemical characteristics of dissolved carbon were similar in both the snowmelt and rainfall runoff periods in the two catchments. These results emphasize that warmer climate would largely alter the seasonal runoff patterns and promote dissolved carbon export in the snowmelt period, which would lead to more unexpected ecological impacts on the aquatic systems in the south Eurasian permafrost.

AB Mapping the spatial and temporal changes of peatland in farming systems is crucial to the study of soil quality and productivity and the modeling of the global carbon cycle (in relation to climate change). This study compiles a contemporary map (2010) of peatland coverage (according to Kyoto protocol) across the cultivated wetlands of Denmark and compares this actual map to a historical 1975 peat coverage map using simple indicator kriging. For the contemporary peatland mapping, extensive soil sampling databases consisting of 42,568 points with 32,817 historical samples and 9,751 contemporary samples were used. These databases contain partly categorical information on parent material (organic [peat, gytje] and mineral [sand, silt and clay]) and partly continuous data (soil organic carbon, in %) reclassified into organic and mineral soils (using 12% soil organic carbon as a cutoff value). In the simple indicator kriging procedure, the values 0 and 1 were assigned to the stationary means of the indicator codes to represent two hypotheses, that is, mineral and organic (peat) soils, respectively. The collected and analyzed contemporary unbiased organic samples (measured on different rectangular grid scales of 250, 275, and 500 m) in addition to some transformed historical organic samples (according to certain decision rules) were used to estimate the recent areal coverage of peat (2010) that was equivalent to 70,176 ha, and this estimate corresponds to an indicator kriging probability of 0.35. Results revealed there has been a total areal coverage loss of 35% (37,786 ha) of the Danish organic cultivated wetlands during a period of 35 years (map 1975 had 107,962-ha coverage of peat). The peat depletion is related to peat mining and agricultural drainage/tillage activities, rather than natural geological processes.

AB Abandoned peat extraction areas are continuous emitters of GHGs; hence, abandonment of peat extraction areas should immediately be followed by conversion to an appropriate after-use. Our primary aim was to clarify the atmospheric impact of reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinacea L.) cultivation on an abandoned peat extraction area and to compare it to other after-treatment alternatives. We performed a life-cycle assessment for five different after-use options for a drained organic soil withdrawn from peat extraction: (I) bare peat soil (no management), (II) non-fertilised Phalaris cultivation, (III) fertilised Phalaris cultivation, (IV) afforestation, and (V) rewetting. Our results showed that on average the non-fertilised and fertilised Phalaris alternatives had a cooling effect on the atmosphere (-10,837 and -477 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively), whereas afforestation, rewetting, and no-management alternatives contributed to global warming (9,511, 8,195, and 2,529 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). The main components influencing the global warming potential of different after-use alternatives were site GHG emissions, carbon assimilation by plants, and emissions from combustion, while management-related emissions played a relatively minor role. The results of this study indicate that, from the perspective of atmospheric impact, the most suitable after-use option for an abandoned peat extraction area is cultivation of RCG.

AB Drainage and cultivation of peat soils stimulates soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization, which substantially increases CO(2) emissions from soils. Large uncertainties are associated with this CO(2) flux, and little data are available, especially in Norway. The objective of the present research was to estimate C losses from cultivated peatlands in West Norway by three independent methods: (1) long-term monitoring of subsidence rates, (2) changes in ash contents, and (3) soil CO(2) flux measurements. Subsidence of cultivated peat soils averaged about 2.5 cm year(-1). We estimated that peat loss and compaction were respectively responsible for 38% and 62% of the total subsidence during a 25-year period after drainage. Based on this estimate the corresponding C loss equals 0.80 kg C m(-2) year(-1). The observed increase in mineral concentration of the topsoil of cultivated peat is proportional to their C loss, providing no mineral particles other than lime and fertilizers are added to the soil. Using this novel approach across 11 sites, we estimated a mean C loss of 0.86 kg C m(-2) year(-1). Soil CO(2) flux measurements, corrected for autotrophic respiration, yielded a C loss estimate from cultivated peat soils of 0.60 kg C m(-2) year(-1). The three methods yielded fairly similar estimates of C losses from Norwegian cultivated peatlands. Cultivated peatlands in Norway cover an estimated 63,000 ha. Total annual C losses from peat degradation were estimated to range between 1.8 and 2 million tons CO(2) year(-1), which equals about 3-4% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from Norway.

AB In spite of advances in greenhouse gas research, the spatiotemporal CH4 and N2O dynamics of boreal land-scapes remain challenging, e.g., we need clarification of whether forest-mire transitions are occasional hotspots of landscape CH4 and N2O emissions during exceptionally high and low ground water level events.
   In our study, we tested the differences and drivers of CH4 and N2O dynamics of forest/mire types in field conditions along the soil moisture gradient of the forest-mire ecotone. Soils changed from Podzols to Histosols and ground water rose downslope from a depth of 10m in upland sites to 0.1m in mires. Yearly meteorological conditions changed from being exceptionally wet to typical and exceptionally dry for the local climate. The median fluxes measured with a static chamber technique varied from -51 to 586 mu gm(-2) h(-1) for CH4 and from 0 to 6 mu m(-2) h(-1) for N2O between forest and mire types throughout the entire wet-dry period.
   In spite of the highly dynamic soil water fluctuations in carbon rich soils in forest-mire transitions, there were no large peak emissions in CH4 and N2O fluxes and the flux rates changed minimally between years. Methane uptake was significantly lower in poorly drained transitions than in the well-drained uplands. Water-saturated mires showed large CH4 emissions, which were reduced entirely during the exceptional summer drought period. Near-zero N2O fluxes did not differ significantly between the forest and mire types probably due to their low nitrification potential. When up-scaling boreal landscapes, pristine forest-mire transitions should be regarded as CH4 sinks and minor N2O sources instead of CH4 and N2O emission hotspots.

AB The hydrological cycle has significant effects on the terrestrial carbon (C) balance through its controls on photosynthesis and C decomposition. A detailed representation of the water cycle in terrestrial C cycle models is essential for reliable estimates of C budgets. However, it is challenging to accurately describe the spatial and temporal variations of soil water, especially for regional and global applications. Vertical and horizontal movements of soil water should be included. To constrain the hydrology-related uncertainty in modelling the regional C balance, a three-dimensional hydrological module was incorporated into the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon-budget model (InTEC V3.0). We also added an explicit parameterization of wetlands. The inclusion of the hydrological module considerably improved the model's ability to Simulate C content and balances in different ecosystems. Compared with measurements at five flux-tower sites, the model captured 85% and 82% of the variations in volumetric soil moisture content in the 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm depths during the growing season and 84% of the interannual variability in the measured C balance. The simulations showed that lateral subsurface water redistribution is a necessary mechanism for simulating water table depth for both poorly drained forest and peatland sites. Nationally, soil C content and their spatial variability are significantly related to drainage class. Poorly drained areas are important C sinks at the regional scale, however, their soil C content and balances are difficult to model and may have been inadequately represented in previous C cycle models. The InTEC V3.0 model predicted an annual net C uptake by Canada's forests and wetlands for the period 1901-1998 of 111.9 Tg C yr(-1), which is 41.4 Tg C yr(-1) larger than our previous estimate (InTEC V2.0). The increase in the net C uptake occurred mainly in poorly drained regions and resulted from the inclusion of a separate wetland parameterization and a detailed hydrologic module with lateral flow in InTEC V3.0.

AB Loss of organic matter from cultivated peat soils is a threat to farmers, due to the surface subsidence associated with organic matter loss, and to the atmosphere, due to CO2 and N2O emissions from the soil. In a three-year field experiment (2015-2017) on a drained, cultivated fen peat in southern Sweden, we tested whether reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) perform better on peat soils than the commonly grown timothy grass (Phleurn pratense L.), without increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In the experiment, we compared yield, nutrient uptake, penetration resistance and loss of organic matter measured as greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O and CH4). Yield of timothy was significantly lower than that of reed canary grass and tall fescue in 2016, and lower than that of reed canary grass in 2017. Yield level increased over time, with total dry matter yield in 2017 of 11.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for timothy, 13.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for tall fescue and 14.3 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for reed canary grass. Total removal of all macronutrients in 2016 was higher in reed canary grass and tall fescue than in timothy. For nitrogen (N), reed canary grass removed a total of 173 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), tall fescue 169 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and timothy 121 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), while the fertilisation rate was only 50 kg N ha(-1). There were no differences in trafficability, measured as penetration resistance. Measurements of greenhouse gas emissions in the snow-free season in 2016 and 2017 using manual dark chambers (CO2, N2O and CH4) and in 2016 automatic dark chambers (CO2) revealed only small differences in CO2 emissions between the treatments. The N2O emissions were also low and CH4 emissions were very low and in general negative. The estimated carbon capture efficiency (ratio of C in aboveground biomass plus roots to emitted CO2-C measured by the automatic chambers) for the growing season (May-October) in 2016 was lowest for timothy (0.61) and higher for reed canary grass and tall fescue (0.70 and 0.70, respectively). Reed canary grass and tall fescue are thus promising alternatives to timothy on peat soils regarding yield, nutrient removal and carbon capture efficiency.

AB Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is used to monitor the moisture content in soils including peat. The objective of this study was to develop a TDR-based method to measure the vertical moisture profile in a peat biofilter operating in the field, where access to the filter is limited to the top surface. The moisture profile with depth can then be used to infer or assess the operating status of a filter in terms of clogging. The successful application of water content measurement using horizontal TDR probes has been demonstrated by many researchers. In this study, a single TDR probe was sequentially advanced into a peat column to estimate the vertical moisture profile and the results were compared to horizontal TDR and gravimetric measurements. The experiment was carried out in six peat columns during a drainage process and two columns during a clogging process. Water contents by the vertical and horizontal probes agreed very well, although the data was slightly more scattered in the columns subject to clogging due to signal attenuation. Total signal attenuation was observed with longer probes in clogged peat soils. However, there was a consistent discrepancy between the TDR measured water contents and those determined gravimetrically, which is believed to be caused by a systematic error, possibly error with the calibration curve.

AB Tidal inundation extent and duration, and water drainage and retention by marsh peat - marsh hydrology determine most physical and ecological characteristics of salt marsh systems. Ditching, installed across nearly all marshes on the US east coast by 1940 to control mosquitoes, alters marsh hydrology. Two linchpin papers are used here as springboards to review the literature that describes the resulting effects, which clearly include reduced water table height for most marshes and changes in avian populations. Effects on invertebrate populations, including mosquitoes, are generally less, although to a smaller degree than is sometimes reported. Impacts on nekton are not clear, although probably negative. Tidal range and the degree of tide asymmetry appear to have greater effects on intermarsh variations in effects from ditching than has generally been appreciated or studied. Overall, although changed patterns of nutrient releases and promotion of Phragmites australis invasions are important ecological effects extending beyond individual sites, and salt marsh aesthetics are marred, ditching impacts are less than certain other anthropogenic alterations of coastal processes that affect salt marshes and estuarine ecology to a much greater extent.

AB Ditches draining two cranberry (Vaccinium spp.) bogs flowing into salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) bearing waterbodies in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada, were sampled in 1992 to determine the distribution and persistence of azinphos-methyl (AZI) and parathion (PAR) following three treatments through an irrigation system (chemigation), to control the black-headed fireworm (Rhopobota naevana Hbn), One bog was surrounded by a secured dike system for water retention and the other by a leaking dike system, representing a worst-case scenario. After each treatment, AZI and PAR residues were detected in ditch water (detection limit = 0.05 mu g/L) and sediments (detection limit = 5 mu g/kg) inside and outside the bogs and they persisted for 72 and 32 d, respectively. The highest concentrations in water were 175 mu g/L for AZI and 21 mu g/L for PAR, Concentrations of AZI and PAR in sediments ranged from not detected to 1582 mu g/kg and persisted for 210 and 13 d, respectively, Low levels of aerial drift resulting from the treatment were detected beyond the outer perimeter of the sprinkler irrigation system in the cranberry bogs. Off-site release of insecticide residues occurred in the leaking dike system but not in the secured dike system, The released insecticide residues adversely affected nontarget aquatic organisms, Harvested cranberries contained no detectable (detection limit = 5 mu g/kg) residues of AZI and PAR.

AB Potential benefits of peatland restoration by rewetting include carbon sequestration, restored biodiversity, and improved hydrological functions. There is great uncertainty about how catchment hydrological processes change after restoration, with a particular lack of well-documented catchment runoff data. This study compared five formerly Disturbed (now Restored) and two undisturbed peatlands. In total, 455 and 728 hydrological events were selected for the analysis, using a three-event selection technique. Mean event runoff coefficient (RC) values varied greatly between conditions and hydrological events. RC in Disturbed conditions was slightly higher than in undisturbed conditions, but RC in Restored conditions was higher than under other conditions. Mean transit time revealed that event rainfall water reached the outlet faster in Disturbed conditions. Mean event peak flow in Disturbed conditions was higher and peaked faster than under other conditions. However, the base flow showed no noticeable difference between treatments. Significantly higher watertable (WT) rise per rainfall input (0.36-0.85 cm/mm) was observed in Disturbed conditions, due to lower specific yield (Sy) values (0.13-0.24) than under Restored and undisturbed conditions (Sy 0.25-0.50). Shallow WT showed significant positive correlations with runoff and storage properties and was a key component of the runoff generation mechanisms in peatlands. Storage-related parameters (Sy, WT rise per rainfall input) and catchment response time parameters revealed disturbance-related hydrological changes in peatlands more clearly than other runoff parameters tested (e.g., RC). Overall, with restoration, WT and storage properties recovered to the levels at undisturbed sites but increased runoff was observed occasionally due to wetter antecedent moisture conditions.

ID HISTORY; RECORD; RISE
AB Understanding how Holocene sea levels influenced coastal wetland development in the Caribbean will aid wetland management in the context of predicted sea level rise. Nine radiocarbon dates from the Maracas and Nariva Swamps on wave-dominated coasts from Trinidad, show sea level was -9 in approximately 7000 yr BP, and rose gradually to -2 m by 2000 yr BP. Since then there may have been isostatic readjustment. Wetlands developed with a transgression of dry upland habitats by rising seas and the facultative halophyte Rhizophora colonized the new brackish water environment. A freshwater plant community gradually replaced the Rhizophora as the marine influence decreased. At Maracas, higher sea levels caused wetland retreat as beach and lagoon habitats migrated inland. Sand ridges in Nariva Swamp indicate that, as in Maracas Swamp, sea level rise created beaches and lagoons, but that these landforms prograded as additional nearshore sediments were deposited. Basins were also filled with sediment delivered by streams that drain the watershed, and by mangrove peat accumulation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Organic carbon solution and transport processes which occur during periods of heavy rainfall and periods or little or no rainfall, can exert a significant control over a systems' annual organic carbon budget. In addition, either or both extremes can be key contributors to contaminant release, water discolouration, flood risk or vegetation growth. Although there is an increasing body of work studying hydrological responses to peatland restoration, there are very little available data on the performance of restored peatlands during these key periods. This study builds on previous work from an upland peatland in Wales that has been restored through drain-blocking, and presents evidence from a landscape scale experimental study at the site. A comparison of sampling scales within the study demonstrates the necessity of larger spatial scales, in combination with high resolution datasets, in assessing catchment level responses. Our results suggest that drain blocking leads to higher and more stable water tables that are able to better resist drought periods, and thus lead to more stable discharge from the system. The shallower water tables and pooling in drains also appear to reduce the production and transport of fluvial organic carbon, and thus less organic material is available to be released as during peak flow or dry periods. Despite restoration apparently reducing the available water storage within the peat, the increase in overland flow and in pooling within blocked drains appears to have led to a less flashy system. Peak flow responses in both drains and upland streams are less severe, with more rainfall being retained within the bog. We suggest that restoration leads to a more buffered system, with more moderate responses to extreme events, and reduced release of both dissolved and particulate organic carbon. We discuss the implications of this for fluxes of fluvial organic carbon and sediment loss. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Depth profiles of total S, organic S, soluble SO42-S, FeS, and FeS2 were characterized for Sphagnum-derived peat cores collected from 9 sites. Marcell S-2 Bog (MN), Tamarack Swamp (PA), Cranesville Swamp (MD/WV), and Big Run Bog (WV) receive water from precipitation and upland runoff; atmospheric S deposition is 13, 47, 54, and 114 mmol m-2, yr-1, respectively. McDonald's Branch Swamp (NJ) is predominantly groundwater fed. Tub Run Bog (WV) and Allegheny Mining Bog (MD) receive augmented SO42- inputs through acid coal mine drainage. Jezerni slat' and Bozi Dar Bog in Czechoslovakia receive atmospheric S inputs of 33 and 243 mmol m-2 yr-1, respectively. In the peat from all sites except Allegheny Mining Bog, where the substantially augmented SO42- input was reflected in an unusually high dissolved SO42- pool in the surface peat, organic S (probably mostly carbon bonded S) was the dominant S fraction; FeS2 was generally the dominant inorganic S fraction. Subsurface peaks in total S, organic S and FeS2-S in peat from the runoff water fed sites were interpreted as indicative of depth-dependent patterns in S reduction/oxidation and in S immobilization/mineralization. Unless SO42- inputs to a site are tremendously augmented (e.g., Allegheny Mining Bog), the rapid turnover of the dissolved SO42- pool combined with the relative stability of the other inorganic and organic S pools, apparently functions as an effective buffer against site differences in S inputs, leading to a general similarity in vertical S profiles in the peat deposits.

AB This study was conducted in a drained, exploited, and afforested Baltic bog Bagno Kusowo, located in North West Poland. The study aimed (i) to assess if human activity has a stronger impact on tree-ring width of Pinus sylvestris than climatic conditions in this transformed Baltic bog; (ii) to investigate how much the human modification of the ecosystem has influenced tree growth; (iii) to use this knowledge to reconstruct changes in the ecosystem further back in time, in the study area and its immediate neighbourhood. Wood samples for dendrochronological analyses were collected from 45 trees. Next, using classic dating methods and standard procedures (cross-dating methods, COFECHA program), chronologies were constructed (raw tree-ring width and residual chronologies: de-trended, autocorrelation removed, ARSTAN program). They formed a basis for further analyses: signature years, correlation and response function, as well as percentage growth change. The results of dendroclimatological analyses show weak increment-climate relationships and the analysis of weather conditions in the identified signature years did not detect any unambiguous relations with tree-ring width. However, results of the analyses indicate that the dominant factors affecting tree growth dynamics in the bog are changes in the hydrological system. Moreover, our results show many phases of human impact on environmental changes. Dendrochronological methods, combined with an analysis of old maps and other historical records, allowed us to reconstruct transformations of the ecosystem with a high resolution.

AB Questions
   How does draining affect the composition of vegetation? Are certain functional groups favoured? Can soil parameters explain these differences?
   Location
   Central Faroe Islands, treeless islands in the northern boreal vegetation zone. Since 1987, an area of 21 km2 at 100-200 m a.s.l. was drained in order to provide water for hydro-electric production.
   Method
   Vegetation and soil of a drained area and a control, undrained neighbouring area of approximately the same size were sampled in 2007. Six sites were sampled in each area. The vegetation was classified with cluster analysis.
   Results
   Four plant communities were defined in the area: Calluna vulgaris-Empetrum nigrum-Vaccinium myrtillus heath, Scirpus cespitosus-Eriophorum angustifolium blanket mire, Carex bigelowii-Racomitrium lanuginosum moss-heath, Narthecium ossifragum-Carex panacea mire. Heath was more extensively distributed within, and was the dominant community of the drained area, whereas moss-heath was more extensive in the undrained area. Blanket mire and mire had approximately the same distribution in both areas. For the blanket mire, species composition indicated drier conditions in the drained than in the undrained area. The drained area had higher frequencies of woody species and lichens, grasses had finer roots and available soil phosphate was considerably higher, whereas the undrained area had higher frequencies of grasses and sedges.
   Conclusion
   The dominant plant communities were different in the two areas, which indicated that the blanket mire was drying in the drained area. Higher concentration of soil phosphate in the drained area also indicated increased decomposition of organic soils owing to desiccation.

AB Surface coal mining severely affects natural ecosystems, though it might also result in an establishment of biologically unique anthropogenic habitats. We studied spontaneously created post-mining calcareous brooks located at the brown coal spoil heap in the Sokolov coal basin (Czechia). Despite their extreme water conditions, linked most to the ionic mixture of dissolved ions (mainly SO42-, Ca2+ and Mg2+), and ferric hydroxide precipitations, we recorded unexpectedly species-rich assemblages there (150 species), including several spring fen specialists (31 species) and eight threatened red-listed species. Macroinvertebrate assemblages of post-mining calcareous habitats were compared with those reported from natural brooks draining Western Carpathians calcareous spring fens. The species richness found in the post-mining calcareous brooks was significantly lower than that of the natural calcareous spring brooks. Although we found 29% of species recorded in the two study systems in common (i.e. 80 species), species composition of their assemblages was systematically distinct. This suggests a possible role of environmental filtering in the post-mining brooks and/or dispersal limitation of some species typical for natural calcareous spring brooks (e.g. Trichodrilus strandi, Bythinella austriaca). In contrast, many macroinvertebrates, particularly those of high dispersal capacities (i.e. Odonata, Coleoptera and Diptera), can recognize post-mining calcareous brooks as surrogate habitats for the natural calcareous spring brooks.

AB The Upper Weichselian and Holocene layers of the 190 m thick peat sequence in the Philippi basin (NE Greece) are studied by means of their mineralogical and geochemical features. The ash contents range between 11.4 and 53.4% and inorganic carbon contents range between 0.5 and 5.7%. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that Mg-calcite, quartz, clay minerals, K-feldspars, plagioclases, and chlorites are the dominant minerals in the peat. Lime, pyrite, siderite, apatite, iron-oxides, weddellite, and basaluminite occur subordinately. During Upper Pleniglacial and Late Glacial times, clastic sedimentation prevailed in the palaeomire. Peat was enriched in Fe, K, Ti, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Rb, Th, Y, Zn, and Zr. In Early Holocene, authigenic sedimentation of Ca-rich material dominated. Peat became enriched in As, Br, Se, Sr, and U. In Middle Holocene, fluctuations of the water table in the mire resulted in the deposition of both authigenic and clastic minerals. The Late Holocene peat is intensely damaged due to drainage and cultivation. The mineral matter features of the Upper Weichselian peat are identical to the features of many Greek lignites.

ID RETENTION
AB Minerotrophic peatlands play an important role in the regulation of water quality and quantity but due to drainage and agricultural land use most of these systems have lost this function. In Central Europe, many re-wetting projects have been implemented to restore wetlands for multifunctional purposes during the last years. The Pohnsdorfer Stauung (Northern Germany) is a eutrophic fen which was used for intensive agriculture for 40 years. The peatland is divided in two subareas by a small stream. In the scope of re-wetting measures, one subarea (westpolder) was flooded by blockading the main drainage ditch in 1996/97, a second subarea (eastpolder) was re-connected to the stream by an inlet and outlet in 2001. Nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics were investigated in the surface water of these systems over a 5-year (westpolder) and 3-year (eastpolder) period, and balances were calculated. In both polders high dynamics of nitrogen and phosphate concentrations were observed in the surface water. Nitrate peaked in the winter months, whereas ammonium, phosphate and organically bound nitrogen (No,,) revealed highest values during summer. Daily balances for the eastpolder and annual balances for both polders were calculated. In both polders nitrate was retained but phosphate and N-org were exported. Differences of the nutrient dynamics and the absolute and relative balances between the polders were due to the different hydrology: the eastpolder received a high nitrate load by the stream, in the westpolder nutrient loads are low and internal nutrient cycles are dominating. During the summer months, high ammonium concentrations, oxygen depletion, and phosphate release occur in the warm, stagnant water of both polders. Normally, high phosphate and ammonium concentrations did not coincided with discharge phases from the polders. However, in August 2002 after heavy rainfall high phosphorus and ammonium discharge was observed. One important factor influencing the detected nutrient dynamics and balances is the change from a drained and fertilized peatland to a flooded wetland in only a few years. We conclude that continuous water flow and stable water levels are desired for flooded peatlands to prevent high concentrations of ammonium and phosphate and to utilize the potential for nitrate retention. In degenerated peatlands, flooding should only be regarded as an easy technological solution in order to conserve the peat mineralization, and to form the foundation for the further development of the peatland to a more efficient nutrient retaining system.

AB Drained and cultivated fen peats represent some of the world's most productive soils, however, they are susceptible to degradation and typically exhibit high rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. We hypothesised that GHG losses from these soils could be reduced by manipulating water table depth, tillage regime, crop residue application or horticultural fleece cover. Using intact soil columns from a horticultural peatland, emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 were monitored over a six-month period, using a closed-chamber method. Concurrent measurements of soil properties allowed identification of the key controls on GHG emissions. Raising the water table to the soil surface provided the strongest reduction in global warming potential (GWP(100); 25 +/- 6 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), compared to a free-draining control (80 +/- 1 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), but this effect was partially negated by an emission pulse when the water table was subsequently lowered. The highest emissions occurred when the water table was maintained 15 cm below the surface (168 +/- 11 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), as this stimulated N2O loss. Placement of horticultural fleece over the soil surface during spring had no significant effect on GWP100, but prolonged fleece application exacerbated GHG emissions. Leaving lettuce crop residues on the surface increased soil GWP(100) (105 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)) in comparison to when residues were incorporated into the soil (85 +/- 4 kg CO2-e ha(-1) d(-1)), however, there was no evidence that this promoted positive priming of native soil organic matter (SOM). For maximum abatement potential, mitigation measures should be applied during the growing season, when GHG emissions are greatest. Our results also suggest that introduction of zero or minimum-till practices may not reduce GHG emissions. Maintaining a high water table was the only option that reliably reduced GHG emissions, however, this option is impractical to implement within current horticultural systems. We conclude that alternative strategies or a major change in land use (e.g., conversion from horticulture/arable to wetland) should be explored as a means of preserving these soils for future generations.

DE Peatland; Economics; Stakeholder analysis; Ecosystems; Soils
ID CONSERVATION; VALUATION; SERVICES; AREA
AB Most of the pressures on peat soils that are responsible for their declining state are associated with human interventions, most notably land drainage for agriculture. Deteriorating stocks of peat soils and degradation of related ecosystem service flows have impacts not only on immediate users but also on society as a whole. It is important therefore that strategies to address these issues fully integrate socio-economic factors as they influence the pressures, help interpret the impacts, and justify suitable interventions to deliver sustainable management of peat soils. In this context, using a combination of stakeholder analysis and the functions, uses and values framework, stakeholder preferences for peatland functions were explored, along with the current drivers and associated responses in peatland areas. It was found that non-use values such as nature conservation are more prevalent now than in the past, and that agricultural economics has reflected this. it was also found that a high value placed is on the agricultural use of peatlands, and its associated benefits. Indeed, in the context of very recent strengthening of food prices in response to global deficits, there is renewed interest in sustaining the productive capacity of peatlands for some types of intensive farming. Although reconciling differing stakeholder interests is not easy, there is opportunity to develop a policy framework to encourage wise peatland management systems across Northern Europe. This requires that peatland ecosystems are explicitly incorporated into peatland management decisions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; UNSATURATED SOILS; CONDUCTIVITY
AB Soil moisture governs many biogeochemical processes in peatlands. Modeling of those processes relative to climate and anthropogenic influences requires knowledge of the basic hydraulic properties of different peat soils in a function form. Water retention of undisturbed surface peat samples, collected at four depths at each of 38 undrained and drained pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) mire sites, was measured for suction pressures of -0.98, -3.10, -6.19, -9.81, -98.1, and -1554.25 kPa, The obtained data were used to test several well-known water retention models commonly applied to mineral soils, The most suitable model was found to be van Genuchten's model if the residual water content was omitted. Feat characteristics were used to explain the variation in the model's shape parameters. Accounting for the remains of Sphagnum, Carer, Eriophorum, and lignin and the distinction between shallow and deep peat layers considerably improved the moisture retention predictions compared with using bulk density only. The different behavior of the shallow vs. the deep peat layers was mainly attributed to the Sphagnum and lignin residues, but not to the Carer residues. We developed a semiempirical model with only one shape parameter, which was clearly better explained by the peat characteristics than the two shape parameters of the van Genuchten model, We recommend that for statistical investigations or investigations requiring a robust model. the semiempirical model be used. The van Genuchten model is to be preferred in predicting the moisture conditions near saturation.

AB In parallel with intensified development of the Polish part of Uznam Island, there is an increase in the demand for drinking water in this area. This island ranks among areas with low water resources, which at the present time are allocated. In order to create the prospect of increased groundwater resources, a concept has been developed that allows for the recovery of part of the freshwater from drainage systems which discharge into the waters of Szczecin Lagoon or the River Swina. The present article discusses the secondary use of water from drainage systems for supply of the Wydrzany resource area. The notion of using water from the White Bridge pumping station was considered the most promising. The catchment area of the polder is 880 ha, 280 ha of which are located on Polish territory. The White Bridge pumping station transfers water from the polder, which it leads to the Peat Channel which, in turn, drains water gravitationally into Szczecin Lagoon. Here, results of simulations aimed at the use of drainage water to improve upon groundwater resources in the "Wydrzany" intake are discussed. On the basis of these simulations of artificial water supply to the intake, an increase of available resources by up to 50 per cent may be expected.

AB Wood ash produced as a by-product in paper mills and heating power plants contains many toxic heavy metals, including high cadmium (Cd) concentrations. The addition of wood ash on drained and forested peatlands to improve forest growth and nutrient balance is common practice in Finland but creates a risk of increasing Cd concentration in the soil and Cd release into recipient waters. Leaching of Cd from ash-treated peat was studied in a mesocosm experiment with three different ash doses (300, 600 and 1,200 g ash m(-2)), which have been commonly applied for fertilization in boreal forests and forested peatlands. Ash contained 5.4 mg Cd kg(-1), which corresponds doses of 1.6, 3.2 and 6.5 mg Cd m(-2). The mesocosm studies showed that all ash treatments clearly lowered pH (from 3.6 to 3.4-3.3) and dissolved organic carbon concentrations (from 97 to ca. 50 mg C l(-1)) in the run-off water during an 11-week experiment. However, only the application of the highest dose, 1,200 g ash m(-2), increased the Cd concentrations in the run-off water from the initial concentration of 1.25-1.75 mu g Cd l(-1). The treatment of peat with 300 or 600 g ash m(-2) did not increase Cd leaching as compared to the untreated peat. We measured high pH values (between 6.1 and 7.0) and high Cd concentrations only in the upper layers of ash-treated peat, which clearly indicated that most of Cd was tightly retained in the surface peat. The effects of Cd on the aquatic ecosystem were studied in microcosms where run-off water from mesocosms was added into aquariums containing humic lake water, lake sediment, bryophytes and benthic animals. The microcosm experiment showed that only the run-off water received from the highest ash treatment increased the Cd concentration of microcosm water. Greater Cd concentrations were found in benthic animals, Asellus aquaticus isopod, in treatments with the highest ash doses, but accumulation of Cd was not observed in the bottom material or in the bryophytes (Fontinalis antipyretica). According to the results, the risk of Cd release from peat after ash application is of minor short-term importance when low ash doses (between 300 and 600 g ash m(-2)) are used. Ash addition, however, temporally increased the acidity of discharge water, which may contribute to the mobilization of Cd from the peat and enhance the risk of bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms especially in acid waters.

AB Big Dam West, located in Kejimkujik Park, Nova Scotia, Canada, is a remote lake with elevated Hg concentrations in fish due in part to low pH and high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. These features reflect the poor buffering capacity of peat lands in the flat drainage basin. To address the multiple species of Hg, a model was developed by coupling the "multiplier method" for multi-species chemicals with average concentration ratios to tile Quantitative Water Air Sediment Interaction (QWASI) model. Elemental Hg was the "key species" modeled. Total Hg fluxes and concentrations were computed using concentration ratios. Many of the concentrations and Hg flux processes within tile Big Dam West catchment had been previously measured with concentration ratios that were either computed or taken from tile literature when measured data were not available. Measured values for total Hg concentration in each compartment (air, water, sediment) and Hg fluxes (e.g., precipitation, sediment deposition) enable verification of model concentration and flux estimates for total Hg in each enviroilmental compartment. The model was also run with and without tile inclusion of upward Hg fluxes from the underlying sediment to determine tile significance of this controversial flux. The Hg QWASI model presented in this paper could be a valuable screening tool, especially for remote lakes, due to its ability to provide reasonable Hg estimates with a limited amount of data (water inflow rate, suspended particulate matter, sediment deposition velocity, and concentration of Hg in atmosphere and inflow water).

AB This study explores the history of the development of Sphagnum communities in an ombrotrophic peatland - Bagno Kusowo - over the past 650years, based on high-resolution plant macrofossil and testate amoebae analysis. Our research provided information related to the length of peatland existence and the characteristics of its natural/pristine state before the most recent human impacts. Changes in the Sphagnum communities before human impact could have resulted from climate cooling during the Little Ice Age' (LIA). In this cold and unstable hydrological period, among vascular plants, Eriophorum vaginatum and Baeothryon caespitosum dominated in the peatland vegetation. Peat-forming Sphagnum communities survived the drainage conducted during the 20th century at the Bagno Kusowo bog. We provide three important messages through this study: (1) testate amoebae reflect similar hydrological trends in two peat cores despite considerable microhabitat variability, (2) average long-term water level 10cm below the surface should be a target for active bog conservation and (3) sites like Bagno Kusowo are extremely important to preserve the remains of pristine biodiversity (including genetic diversity of plants and protists) that was completely removed from most of the raised bogs in Europe due to human activities, for example, drainage.

AB 1. A valid strategy to mitigate the eutrophication of water bodies due to non-point source phosphorus (P) pollution and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases is the rewetting of degraded peatlands. However, long-term drainage and intensive agricultural use make it unlikely that the original sink functions for nutrients and carbon (C) as well as low-nutrient conditions can be re-established within a human time perspective.
   2. We hypothesized that the removal of the upper degraded peat layer can be a suitable measure to avoid the negative implications of excess mobilization of P and C after rewetting. To evaluate the effect of top soil removal (TSR) we performed lab and field experiments in six inundated peatlands in northern Germany without TSR compared to six inundated sites with TSR. In addition, we included data from a rewetted peatland where the degraded peat had been removed from about half of the area and groundwater level was just beneath the soil surface.
   3. The results emphasized that following inundation newly formed detritus mud layers overlying the former peat surface are the dominating source for P and methane in particular in sites without TSR but also in sites with TSR, although at significantly lower rates. Although highly decomposed peat released more or less no methane, dissolved organic matter mobilization was highest in this substrate while less decomposed peat was characterized in general by lowest rates of mobilization.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Top soil removal prior to rewetting can be a suitable method to avoid the negative consequences of the excess release of phosphorus (P) and carbon post-rewetting. We developed a simple decision support schematic to assist the peatland restoration process and to better understand the implications of top soil removal. Despite the potential benefits, top soil removal should not be declared as a universal method, as it requires detailed consideration prior to application. However, this and other research demonstrate that it is inevitable that without any further management interventions high mobilization of P, dissolved organic matter and methane may persist for centuries following rewetting of peatlands.

AB After drainage of natural boreal peatlands, the decomposition of organic matter increases and peat soil may turn into a net source of CO2 and N2O, whereas CH4 emission is known to decrease. Afforestation is a potential mitigation strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emission from organic agricultural soils. A static chamber technique was used to evaluate the fluxes of CH4, N2O and CO2 from three boreal organic agricultural soils in western Finland, afforested 1, 6 or 23 years before this study. The mean emissions of CH4 and N2O during the growing seasons did not correlate with the age of the tree stand. All sites were sources of N2O. The highest daily N2O emission during the growing season, measured in the oldest site, was as high as 29 mg N2O m(-2)d(-1). In general, organic agricultural soils are sinks for methane. Here, the oldest site acted as a small sink for methane, whereas the two youngest afforested organic soils were sources for methane with maximum emission rates (up to 154 mg m(-2)d(-1)) similar to those reported for minerogenous natural peatlands. Soil respiration rates decreased with the age of the forest. The high soil respiration in the younger sites, probably resulted from the high biomass production of herbs, could create soil anaerobiosis and increase methane production. Our results show that afforestation of agricultural peat soils does not abruptly terminate the N2O emissions during the first two decades, and afforestation can even enhance methane emission for a few years. The carbon accumulation in the developing tree stand can partly compensate the carbon loss from soil.

AB We studied the variation in growth of individual trees in a population of Pinus sylvestris near Zurich in relation to tree age, size, and local competition. This population established naturally when the drainage pattern in a peat bog was altered after the Second World War. An unusual opportunity to study stand development was afforded when the trees were harvested in 1987 as part of a restoration program. All tree stumps were mapped, and growth since establishment was measured as cross-sectional area of wood in 5-yr intervals, using disks from the base of each tree.
   The distribution of cross-sectional area was lognormal over most of the period of growth. Size at the beginning of a time interval was the primary determinant of individual growth during that interval, but age and local competition also had significant effects. Younger, smaller trees were better fitted by an exponential growth model, whereas older, larger trees were better fitted by a Gompertz (sigmoidal) model. Some of the results were very different from previous studies: (1) The spatial distribution of trees was not significantly different from random. (2) Size variability decreased during the course of stand development, even though there was no self-thinning. This was because (3) the density of natural establishment was low, and competition, although clearly detectable, was still relatively weak and symmetric after 45 yr of stand development. Thus, there was no ''initial advantage'' in competition, and the younger trees, which were still growing exponentially, were able to catch up with the older trees, whose relative growth rates were declining.

TI Classification and distribution of freshwater peatlands in Maine
SO NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS; RAISED BOGS; VEGETATION; HABITAT
AB This classification of Maine's freshwater organic wetlands (peatlands) uses nutrient source, geomorphic-hydrologic setting, gross topography of the peat mass, micro topographic pattern, and presence of pools for distinguishing peatland types. We apply these primarily hydro-geomorphological criteria to landscape units called peatland complexes. Vegetation, while important at lower levels of classification and for the description of individual peatlands, is not used in this classification because, typically, all but the smallest peatland complexes in Maine have major areas of differing vegetational physiognomies and types. This classification resembles the peatland division of Canada's current wetland classification more than the classification in most common use in the United States because a large percentage of Maine peatlands are northern in character.
   Our classification contains eight peatland types. Two of these are divided into two subtypes. Only one of the types has unique floristic and vegetational elements: plateau (coastal) bog. Large Maine peatlands typically contain multiple complexes, commonly of more than one type. We use the term multiple-unit peatland for these multiple complexes. Our classification and survey of the distribution of peatland types in Maine is based on a large representative sample of peatlands. We conducted an air photo survey of similar to1100 peatlands throughout the state, observed a representative subset of 171 of these from aircraft at low altitude, and studied a representative subset of 100 of the 171 on the ground. However, to classify a peatland using our system, only air photo study or aerial observation is needed.
   The distribution of peatland types in Maine is controlled by gradients of topography, geological substrate, climate, and hydrology. Peatlands are least abundant in the well-drained western uplands. Unpatterned fens occur throughout Maine, hundreds of the smaller ones (similar to<10 ha) occur in ice-block depressions (kettles). Five types, all of which also occur in Canada, reach their eastern North American southern limits in Maine: ribbed (string) fens at 45degreessimilar to30'N, eccentric bogs at 45degreessimilar to10'N, domed bogs with concentric pattern at 44degreessimilar to45'N, plateau bogs at 44degreessimilar to15'N. and gently convex bogs at 43degreessimilar to20'N. These latitudinal limits exclude individual southern outliers). Distributions of peatland types in adjacent areas of New Hampshire and Canada are consistent with those in Maine. We propose that the geographic position of Maine along a steep south (coastal) to north (inland) climatic gradient and a less-steep west-southwest to east-northeast climatic gradient paralleling the coast are the major factors accounting for the diverse representation of peatland types in so limited an area.

DE spring mire cupola; calcareous tufa; humidity conditions reconstruction
AB The article presents the results of research on spring mire cupolas of the Wolborka River, a left tributary of the Pilica River. The sedimentary sequence overlies fluvial sands and includes three series of calcareous tufa separated by peat layers. C-14 dating indicates that the sedimentation in the spring mire area began in the late Atlantic (AT) and ended at the end of the Subboreal period (SB2). Analysis of lithological features of the sediments has allowed the reconstruction of environmental conditions and their impact on the functioning of the groundwater outflow zone in the late Holocene. The mutual relationship between the peat layers and successive series of calcareous tufa records the changes in humidity conditions resulting from periodic changes in climatic conditions. The sediments of the spring mire cupolas, which are composed mostly of calcite, also contain gypsum and pyrite. The ratio of gypsum to pyrite has proven to be a useful tool for reconstructing humidity condictions. It has become the basis for demonstrating that calcareous tufas are sediments of dry periods, and the deposition of cupola sediments depended on the hydrodynamic regime and flow rate of the springs. The main factor contributing to the deposition of calcite was the equilibration of the groundwater solution with the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, at low flow dynamics.

AB Spatial variation of C stocks within peatlands is an overall challenge for monitoring global C cycle processes, which is critical for responding to climate change induced by greenhouse gases (GHGs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of high-resolution, minimally invasive sensor data to predict spatial variation of soil organic C (SOC) stocks within highly degraded peatland soils in northeast Germany. Within the Rhin-Havelluch, a paludification mire that has been cultivated and drained for about 300 yr, seven fields were sampled by soil cores up to 2 m in depth, nine points for each field. Soil horizons were examined for dry bulk density, soil organic C content (SOCC), and thickness to calculate SOC stocks and to test for relationships with overall peat thickness, elevation, and electrical conductivity (ECa). Elevation was determined by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ECa by an EM38DD, both producing maps of high resolution (1 m). Soil organic C density (SOCd) was related to elevation, ECa, and peat thickness. Based on these relationships, maps of SOCd were produced. Within field variation of SOCd was high, which could be modeled by use of the covariate maps. If available, ECa maps can improve the prediction of SOCd based on elevation. Modeling peat thickness based on sensor data needs additional research, but seems to be a valuable covariate in digital soil mapping.

AB Peatlands form a large carbon (C) pool but their C sink is labile and susceptible to changes in climate and land-use. Some pristine peatlands are forested, and others have the potential: the amount of arboreal vegetation is likely to increase if soil water levels are lowered as a consequence of climate change. On those sites tree litter dynamics may be crucial for the C balance. We studied the decomposition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needle and root litter in boreal peatland sites representing gradients in drainage succession (succession following water level drawdown caused by forest drainage) and soil nutrient level during several years of varying weather conditions. Neither gradient had an unambiguous effect on litter mass loss. Mass loss over 2 years was faster in undrained versus drained sites for both needle litter, incubated in the moss layer, and fine root litter, incubated in 0-10 cm peat layer, suggesting moisture stress in the surface layers of the drained sites limited decomposition. Differences among the drained sites were not consistent. Among years, mass loss correlated positively with precipitation variables, and mostly negatively or not at all with temperature sum. We concluded that a long-term water level drawdown in peatlands does not necessarily enhance decay of fresh organic matter. Instead, the drained site may turn into a 'large hummock-system' where several factors, including litter quality, relative moisture deficiency, higher acidity, lower substrate temperature, and in deeper layers also oxygen deficiency, may interact to constrain organic matter decomposition. Further, the decomposition rates may not vary systematically among sites of different soil nutrient levels following water level drawdown. Our results emphasize the importance of annual weather variations on decomposition rates, and demonstrate that single-period incubation studies incorporate an indeterminable amount of temporal variation.

AB Large areas of naturally open peatland in western Europe were drained and planted with non-native conifers in the twentieth century. Efforts arc currently underway to restore many of these sites. Ultimately, forest-to-bog restoration aims to bring back functional peatlands that can sequester carbon but there is a lack of empirical evidence for whether current approaches are effective. Using a chronosequence design, we compared the annual gaseous carbon balance of two forest-to-bog restoration areas with an open area not subject to afforestation. A closed chamber method was used to determine gas fluxes (Net Ecosystem Respiration, Gross Primary Productivity, Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and methane (CH4)) over a twelve-month period for locations spanning the range of peatland microtopography and vegetation communities. Relationships between gas fluxes, vegetation/ cover and environmental factors were analysed and regression models used to estimate annual CO2 and CH4 budgets. During the study period, NEE estimates (total gaseous C expressed as CO2-eq) showed a net sink for the unafforested (-102 g C M-2 yr(-1)) and oldest ( -131 g C M-2 yr(-1)) restoration area (17 years post-restoration 'RES 17 YRS'), whilst the youngest restoration area (6 years post-restoration 'RES 6YRS'), was a net source (35 g C m(-2) yr (-1)). We observed significantly higher CH4 emissions from restoration areas dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium compared with other peatland vegetation types. Sampling points with higher cover of Sphagnum were found to be most effective for C sequestration. Overall, vegetation composition/cover was observed to be an important factor determining C emissions from forest-to-bog restoration areas. These results suggest that restoration is effective in returning the carbon sink function of peatlands damaged by commercial forestry and - depending on restoration techniques - timescales of >10 years may be required.

AB Grazing-oriented drainage of alpine/boreal wetlands has been broadly implemented to meet the increasing demand for animal products. However, the annual methane (CH4) emissions from alpine fens degraded due to drainage for grazing have not been well characterized clue to a lack of year-round observations. In this study, the year-round CH4 fluxes from a degraded alpine fen that is typical in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were measured. The temperature sensitivity of the CH4 emissions during the nongrowing season (NGS) was different between the microsites with and without CH4 uptake during the growing season (GS), showing apparent activation energy of 59-61 vs. 22-43 kJ mol(-1) (or variation folds induced by the 10-degree change (i.e., Q(10)): 2.61-2.74 vs. 1.38-1.91). The CH4 emissions amounted to 0.2-63.3 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (with 0.8 to 41.4 kg C ha(-1) and 0.9 to 21.9 kg C ha(-1) in the GS and NGS, respectively), which were significantly (P < 0.05) related to the distances to the drainage ditch or water tables across the six microsites. As a key factor, the water table determined the role of the CH4 emissions during freezing/thawing. For cool/cold/alpine wetlands with no CH4 uptake in the GS, a mean factor of 1.52 (within a range of 1.00-2.44 at the 95% confidence interval), corresponding to an NGS contribution of 34% (ranging from 0 to 59%), was recommended to upscale the GS emissions to annual totals. Degradation of the native peat marshes in the Zoige region (originally the largest area of alpine wetlands) due to intentional drainage has greatly reduced the quantities of CH4 emissions. Additional studies are still needed to minimize the large uncertainties in CH4 emissions estimates for the changes in alpine wetlands in this region and for the entire TP. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Increased metal mining in the Arctic region has caused elevated loads of arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), nickel (Ni), and sulfate (SO42-) to recipient surface or groundwater systems. The need for cost-effective active and passive mine water treatment methods has also increased. Natural peatlands are commonly used as a final step for treatment of mining influenced water. However, their permanent retention of harmful substances is affected by influent concentrations and environmental conditions. The effects of dilution, pH, temperature, oxygen availability, and contaminant accumulation on retention and leaching of As, Sb, Ni, and sulfate from mine process water and drainage water obtained from treatment peatlands in Finnish Lapland were studied in batch sorption experiments, and discussed in context of field data and environmental impacts. The results, while demonstrating effectiveness of peat to remove the target contaminants from mine water, revealed the risk of leaching of As, Sb, and SO42- from treatment peatlands when diluted mine water was introduced. Sb was more readily leached compared to As while leaching of both was supported by higher pH of 9. No straightforward effect of temperature and oxygen availability in controlling removal and leaching was evident from the results. The results also showed that contaminant accumulation in treatment peatlands after long-term use can lead to decreased removal and escalated leaching of contaminants, with the effect being more pronounced for As and Ni.

   invasion in the Bory Dolnoslaskie Forest
SO SYLWAN

DT Article
DE Spiraea tomentosa; alien species; invasive shrub
AB The steeplebush is a shrub growing naturally in North America. In Europe this species has been cultivated as an ornamental plant since the 18th century. It has been observed in spontaneously developing secondary localities in such countries as Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Germany. In Poland there are three regions in which Spiraea tomentosa is known to be a permanently established anthropophyte: Puszcza Drawska, Bory Niemodlinskie and Bory Dolnoslaskie forests. The greatest number of localities of this shrub can be found in the extensive area of the latter, where its expansion has caused significant changes in the natural environment and problems in woodland management. Therefore a research was carried out to find what conditions made the steeplebush ready for invasion and what types of plant communities were especially susceptible to it. The information about the distribution of S. tomentosa in the Bory Dolnoslaskie Forest (SW Poland) was collected during field observations in the years 2011-2014. We also verified and used the results of a survey made in 2011 in three forest districts located in the study area: Ruszow, Wegliniec and Wymiarki. The analysis concerned the frequency of the steeplebush in the forest environment in terms of the forest habitat type, species composition, and stand growth stage as well as in non-forest environments like meadows, peatland, margins of drainage ditches, etc. Phytocoenoses in the habitats of humid mixed coniferous forests and humid coniferous forests with mature tree stands dominated by birches or alders were found to be forest communities the most susceptible to colonisation by S. tomentosa. Especially susceptible to steeplebush invasion were also forest cultures on those habitats. Much fewer steeplebush localities were recorded on fresh and mixed coniferous forests as well as fresh broadleaved forests. In a non-forest environments the steeplebush was mostly noted on margins of drainage ditches. The extensive system of such man-made environmental structures in the Bory Dolnoslaskie Forest was found to be the most important factor favouring the expansion of S. tomentosa. Thus, the invasion of the discussed species is primarily determined by a large proportion of humid habitats in a single compact woodland complex connected by a dense network of drainage ditches.

AB The population sizes and the breeding success of Finnish tetraonids have been decreasing for decades. In this study, the presence of a grouse hen with a brood in a landscape was used to indicate habitat-related breeding success. We combined the locations of 938 black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), 388 capercaillie (T. urogallus), and 917 hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia) broods after the breeding season in mid-August with landscape data by employing Geographic Information System and grouse data derived from the Finnish wildlife triangle censuses conducted during 1997-2004. Two large study areas with different landscape structures, northern forest-mire area and southern cultivated area, were selected for the investigation. The presence of grouse broods was positively related to the amount of old coniferous mixed forest. Grouse broods may prefer this forest habitat because of a rich understorey cover and a rich bilberry field layer offering a diversity of insects as food. Broods had a strong positive response to the amount of forest habitat. The effect of forest fragmentation on the broods' distribution did not increase even with decreasing forest habitat. We suggest that there are several ecological causes for the observed spatial correlations. Predation on nests and broods by generalist predators is presumably high in human-modified open and semi-open landscapes. Against our expectations, the effect of landscape composition on grouse broods was more marked in the northern than in the southern study area, most likely because predator populations are more food-regulated in the north. This finding supports the alternative prey hypothesis. Further, large drained and reforested peatland mire areas had a negative impact on grouse broods in the north. In the drainage areas, decreased availability of vegetation cover and insect food, increased predation risk, and drowning of chicks in ditches may increase brood mortality.

AB The rewetting technique border irrigation was installed in a degraded fen peatland in northeastern Germany. Because of the prevailing site conditions, the technique resulted in two different rewetting variants (surface irrigation and temporary inundation) at the study site. This paper reports on the practicability of this technique and the influence of rewetting on vegetation development, decomposition processes and soil nutrient availability, and the possibilities for renewed peat accumulation. The technique proved to be suited for rewetting fen sites with a continuous slope, deep peat layer with low hydraulic conductivity, and upstream water recharge facilities. A subsidence of the ground-water levels during the summer months, however, could not be avoided in dry years. The vegetation changed slowly from species-poor grassland into typical fen plant communities, despite rewetting and soil tillage. Species richness, however, was higher in the surface irrigation than in the temporary inundation variant. A sufficient water supply proved to be absolutely necessary to retard decomposition processes because higher decomposition of root materials (i.e., higher k values) occurred under temporary inundated conditions. Generally, the higher water content in the soil after rewetting led to a lower nitrate-N-to-ammonium-N ratio in the topsoil in both rewetting variants. In the surface irrigation variant the mineral nitrogen content (Nmin) of the topsoil decreased from 7.8 to 4.4 g N/m(2), which is also correlated with the increase in water content of the soil. The low Nmin levels of fens which were never deeply drained (0.9-2.8 g N/m(2)), however, were not reached within the observation period of 3 years.

AB The North York Moors National Park, in Northeast England, is one of the few upland areas of the United Kingdom located immediately downwind of major sulphur and nitrogen emission sources. Despite this, few studies of air pollution impacts have been undertaken, and there is no formal long-term upland water quality monitoring site. We examined the condition of surface waters in the National Park based on (1) a unique 20 year stream pH record from three locations; and (2) a snapshot survey of 51 surface waters draining moorland and conifer plantations. Interpretation was supported by sulphur isotope analysis of a subset of water samples, and a diatom survey of one of the monitoring streams. Long-term pH data for a stream draining the peat plateau demonstrate extreme, year-round acidification, with recovery only evident in the last few years. Lower-elevation sites are less acidic, but show similar temporal trends, and are characterised by frequent and severe acid episodes. The snapshot survey confirmed that acidification of the moorland area is widespread, to a degree observed in few other areas globally; out of 37 moorland streams sampled, 32 had an acid neutralising capacity (ANC) below -50 mu equiv.l(-1). Sulphate was found to be (by far) the dominant cause of acidification, and sulphur isotope analysis confirmed that this derives primarily from atmospheric deposition. Nitrate concentrations remain low, indicating that the organic moorland soils continue to retain most incoming nitrogen. It appears that conifer planting has exacerbated acidification, leading to fivefold higher nitrate and threefold higher aluminium concentrations compared to the moorland sites. Available biological data suggest that waters in the region have been impoverished by acidification. We speculate that the slow recovery of surface waters in the North York Moors is due to the release of a legacy of stored sulphur from the peats, released during droughts. We conclude that: (1) acidification is far from being a solved problem in this sensitive near-source upland region, despite reductions in sulphur deposition; (2) plantation forestry has exacerbated the effects of atmospheric pollution, and triggered nitrogen saturation; (3) the lack of any formal long-term monitoring in the North York Moors represents a major gap in the current evidence base for the effects of long-range air pollutants on UK upland ecosystems.

AB In agriculturally used peat land areas, surface water quality standards for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are frequently exceeded, but it is unclear to what extent agriculture is responsible for nutrient loading of the surface water. We quantified the contribution of different sources to the N and P loading of a ditch draining a grassland on peat soil (Terric Histosol) used for dairy fanning in the Netherlands. Measurements were performed on N and P discharge at the end of the ditch, supply of N and P via inlet water, mineralization of soil organic matter, slush application, composition of the soil solution, and on N losses through denitrification in the ditch for 2 years (September 2000 to September 2002). Discharge rates at the end of the ditch were 32 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and 4.7 kg P ha(-1) y(-1). For N, 43 to 50% of the discharge was accounted for by applications of fertilizers, manure and cattle droppings, 17 to 31% by mineralization of soil organic matter, 8 to 27% by nutrient-rich deeper peat layers, 8 to 9% by atmospheric deposition and 3 to 4% by inlet water. For P, these numbers were 10 to 48% for applications of fertilizers, manure and cattle droppings, 2 to 14% mineralization of soil organic matter, 33 to 82% nutrient-rich peat layers and 5 to 6% inlet water. The results of this paper demonstrate that nutrient loading of surface water in peat land areas involves several sources of nutrients, and therefore, reducing one source to reduce nutrient inputs to surface water is likely to result in modest effectiveness.

AB Zooplankton are an essential component of healthy functioning lake and wetland ecosystems. Despite this, zooplankton communities within constructed treatment wetlands (CTWs) in agricultural landscapes remain unstudied. Taxa richness, total abundances and community composition were evaluated for zooplankton assemblages from three habitat types (lakes, CTWs and drainage ditches) within five intensive agricultural peat lake catchments in New Zealand. Relationships to water quality, physicochemical and biotic habitat variables were examined. Zooplankton were dominated by cladocerans, copepods, ostracods and rotifer taxa, representing a range of communities typical of lake and pond habitats. CTWs supported species otherwise absent from lake and drain habitats, increasing the overall biodiversity of the highly-modified peat lake catchments. Taxa richness of CTWs was higher than that of drains, and a few CTWs had greater diversity than several lakes. The morphological variables area and depth contributed to the greatest differences between habitats, followed by pH, inorganic nitrogen, conductivity and temperature. Correspondingly, zooplankton communities were significantly influenced by habitat area, depth and pH, as well as ammonium, phosphate, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and macrophyte cover. Opportunities were explored for refining CTW designs to enhance zooplankton biodiversity and potentially improve treatment efficiency through increasing the complexity and diversity of CTW habitat niches.

DE groundwater; environmental engineering
AB Considerable public discussion was generated during the planning stages of a rural motorway in Ireland regarding the possible effects of the road drainage system on an ecologically important fen, which was about 5 km distant. To overcome this potential problem, a passive groundwater level control system was devised to limit the drawdown by maintaining the water levels 1-75 m above the road surface. This groundwater level corresponded approximately to the seasonal low water levels recorded in the aquifer prior to the construction of the motorway. This is achieved by constructing the motorway within a sealed cross-section with a permeable layer beneath this section, called the underdrainage system, which is connected to drains that outflow at the higher level. This underdrainage system controls the water pressures and flows beneath the sealed section. This paper presents the concept of the passive groundwater control system in a nonhomogeneous glacial aquifer, and analyses the effects of this control system on the groundwater around the motorway. The selection of the design criteria and site control methods for the material within the sealed section is also discussed. The results of site monitoring that show the successful performance of the system in operation are also given.

AB Thermokarst results from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost and alters the biogeochemical cycling in the Arctic by reworking soil material and redistributing soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) along uplands, hillslopes, and lowlands. Understanding the impact of this redistribution is key to better estimating the storage of SOC in permafrost terrains. However, there are insufficient studies quantifying long-term impacts of thaw processes on the distribution of SOC and TN along hillslopes. We address this issue by providing estimates of SOC and TN stocks along the hillslopes of three valleys located on Herschel Island (Yukon, Canada), and by discussing the impact of hillslope thermokarst on the variability of SOC and TN stocks. We found that the average SOC and TN 0-100 cm stocks in the valleys were 26.4 +/- 8.9 kg C m(-2) and 2.1 +/- 0.6 kg N m(-2). We highlight the strong variability in the soils physical and geochemical properties within hillslope positions. High SOC stocks were found at the summits, essentially due to burial of organic matter by cryoturbation, and at the toeslopes due to impeded drainage which favored peat formation and SOC accumulation. The average carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the valleys was 12.9, ranging from 9.7 to 18.9, and was significantly higher at the summits compared to the backslopes and footslopes (p < 0.05), suggesting a degradation of SOC downhill. Carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks were significantly lower on 16% of the sites that were previously affected by hillslope thermokarst (p < 0.05). Our results showed that lateral redistribution of SOC and TN due to hillslope thermokarst has a strong impact on the SOC storage in ice-rich permafrost terrains.

TI Signatures of Molecular Unification and Progressive Oxidation Unfold in

AB The Ob-Irtysh River system is the seventh-longest one in the world. Unlike the other Great Siberian rivers, it is only slightly impacted by the continuous permafrost in its low flow. Instead, it drains the Great Vasyugan mire, which is the world largest swamp, and receives huge load of the Irtysh waters which drain the populated lowlands of the East Siberian Plain. The central challenge of this paper is to understand the processes responsible for molecular transformations of natural organic matter (NOM) in the Ob-Irtysh river system along the South-North transect. For solving this task, the NOM was isolated from the water samples collected along the 3,000 km transect using solid-phase extraction. The NOM samples were further analyzed using high resolution mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopy. The obtained results have shown a distinct trend both in molecular composition and diversity of the NOM along the South-North transect: the largest diversity was observed in the Southern "swamp-wetland" stations. The samples were dominated with humic and lignin-like components, and enriched with aminosugars. After the Irtysh confluence, the molecular nature of NOM has changed drastically: it became much more oxidized and enriched with heterocyclic N-containing compounds. These molecular features are very different from the aliphatics-rich permafrost NOM. They witnesses much more conservative nature of the NOM discharged into the Arctic by the Ob-Irtysh river system. In general, drastic reduction in molecular diversity was observed in the northern stations located in the lower Ob flow.

TI Annual sulfate budgets for Dutch lowland peat polders: The soil is a

AB Annual sulfate mass balances have been constructed for four low-lying peat polders in the Netherlands, to resolve the origin of high sulfate concentrations in surface water, which is considered a water quality problem, as indicated amongst others by the absence of sensitive water plant species. Potential limitation of these plants to areas with low sulfate was analyzed with a spatial match-up of two large databases. The peat polders are generally used for dairy farming or nature conservation, and have considerable areas of shallow surface water (mean 16%, range 6-43%). As a consequence of continuous drainage, the peat in these polders mineralizes causing subsidence rates generally ranging between 2 and 10 mm y(-1). Together with pyrite oxidation, this peat mineralization the most important internal source of sulfate, providing an estimated 96 kg SO4 ha(-1) mm(-1) subsidence External sources are precipitation and water supplied during summer to compensate for water shortage, but these were found to be minor compared to internal release. The most important output flux is discharge of excess surface water during autumn and winter. If only external fluxes in and out of a polder are evaluated, inputs average 37 +/- 9 and exports 169 +/- 17 kg S ha(-1) y(-1). During summer, when evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall, sulfate accumulates in the unsaturated zone, to be flushed away and drained off during the wet autumn and winter. In some polders, upward seepage from early Holocene, brackish sediments can be a source of sulfate. Peat polders export sulfate to the regional water system and the sea during winter drainage. The available sulfate probably only plays a minor role in the oxidation of peat: we estimate that this is less than 10% whereas aerobic mineralization is the most important. Most surface waters in these polders have high sulfate concentrations, which generally decline during the growing season when aquatic sediments are a sink. In the sediment, this sulfur is reduced and binds iron more strongly than phosphorus, which can be released to the overlying water and potentially fuels eutrophication. About 76% of the sampled vegetation-sites exceeded a threshold of 50 mg l(-1), SO4, above which sensitive species, such as Stratiotes aloides, and several species of Potamogeton were significantly less abundant. Thus high sulfate concentrations, mainly due to land drainage and consequent mineralization, appear to affect aquatic plant community composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present early to mid-Holocene palaeocoastline reconstructions for the Tolkuse-Rannametsa area on the eastern coast of the Gulf of Riga. Radiocarbon-dated sediment stratigraphies and diatom analyses, supported by ground-penetrating radar data and GIS-based modelling, were used in the palaeogeographical reconstructions to strip back younger sediments and landforms from the LiDAR-derived digital elevation model. The reconstructions show an open coast environment during the Ancylus Lake stage and the formation of a peatland after the lake drainage at about 9000-8600cal. a BP. The waters of the Litorina Sea flooded the study area between 8200 and 7700cal. a BP, forming a 25-km-long and up to 5.5-m-deep lagoon with two connections to the sea. This brackish water lagoon existed in the area for about 4000years and terminated around 3800-3500cal. a BP as a result of isostatic uplift and growth of the barrier spit. The reconstructions illustrate the relationships between the lagoonal system and three Mesolithic and Neolithic settlement sites found in the study area. A comparative analysis which besides palaeogeographical and ecological data included a data set with more than 100 Stone Age sites from the eastern Baltic region, was used to propose the most suitable locations for coastal settlements in the Tolkuse-Rannametsa area. However, some of these areas are presently covered by a peat layer that is several metres thick, which may explain the relative scarcity of the archaeological finds on the shores of the palaeo-lagoon. The proposed multiproxy approach has the capability to delimit the areas that would have been favourable for prehistoric habitation, but might not be observable in the present-day topography. In return, this increases the likelihood of locating any well-preserved preserved settlement sites and artefacts that are buried under the protective sediment layer.

AB The Zoige peatland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the largest alpine peatland in the world, is currently experiencing unprecedented water stress due to climate change and human activities. However, the consequences for emissions of greenhouse gases have not been well studied. We conducted a 40-month in situ field experiment (including deep, shallow and control water table treatments) to examine the effect of drainage on greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O). The results showed that drainage significantly increased the emission rates and the total cumulative emissions of CO2 (i.e., ecosystem respiration) and N2O, and reduced CH4 emissions. However, under drained conditions, the cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O increased significantly during the growing season (May to September) only, whereas the cumulative emissions of CH4 decreased significantly during both the growing season and the non-growing season (October to April). In addition, drainage significantly increased the biomass of aerobic bacteria and methanotrophs. These results indicate that emissions of greenhouse gases in the Zoige peatland are sensitive to short-term drainage and that future studies should consider the response of greenhouse gas fluxes to environmental changes in the non-growing season.

AB Fire is an important control on the carbon (C) balance of the boreal forest region. Here, we present findings from two complementary studies that examine how fire modifies soil organic matter properties, and how these modifications influence rates of decomposition and C exchange in black spruce (Picea mariana) ecosystems of interior Alaska. First, we used laboratory incubations to explore soil temperature, moisture, and vegetation effects on CO2 and DOC production rates in burned and unburned soils from three study regions in interior Alaska. Second, at one of the study regions used in the incubation experiments, we conducted intensive field measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across an unreplicated factorial design of burning (2 year post-fire versus unburned sites) and drainage class (upland forest versus peatland sites). Our laboratory study showed that burning reduced the sensitivity of decomposition to increased temperature, most likely by inducing moisture or substrate quality limitations on decomposition rates. Burning also reduced the decomposability of Sphagnum-derived organic matter, increased the hydrophobicity of feather moss-derived organic matter, and increased the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in both the upland and peatland sites. At the ecosystem scale, our field measurements indicate that the surface organic soil was generally wetter in burned than in unburned sites, whereas soil temperature was not different between the burned and unburned sites. Analysis of variance results showed that ER varied with soil drainage class but not by burn status, averaging 0.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.4 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) d(-1) in the upland and peatland sites, respectively. However, a more complex general linear model showed that ER was controlled by an interaction between soil temperature, moisture, and burn status, and in general was less variable over time in the burned than in the unburned sites. Together, findings from these studies across different spatial scales suggest that although fire can create some soil climate conditions more conducive to rapid decomposition, rates of C release from soils may be constrained following fire by changes in moisture and/or substrate quality that impede rates of decomposition.

ID PEAT; TUNDRA; FIELD
AB Gracz (2011, Can. J. For. Res. 41: 425-428) proposes that the Good Friday earthquake of 1964 caused falling lake levels and drying wetlands on Alaska's Northern Kenai Lowlands (NKL). His hypothesis states that the earthquake increased hydraulic conductivity by fracturing a leaky confining layer, accelerating drainage of surface water into regional aquifers. We counter that a single model of draining does not apply across the heterogeneity of geomorphology and soils on the NKL. In particular, the NKL's glacial history precludes uniform application of a subsurface hydrologic model for lake draining and the nature of peat-based wetlands precludes its application to wetland drying. Instead, small, yet cumulative, climatic reductions in moisture surplus explain both observed lake level declines and vegetation changes. Moreover, and unlike a climatic hypothesis, a seismic hypothesis fails to explain lake drying elsewhere in Alaska. Although it is likely that the earthquake influenced some hydrologic features in the NKL, it is unlikely that a single hydrologic model based on a simple mechanical cause, e. g., downward drainage, adequately explains the changes observed across the whole NKL. Conversely, we maintain that the uniformity of the vegetation response seen across different landscapes, including wetlands, forests, and alpine areas, throughout the state of Alaska strongly supports a climatic hypothesis.

TI Soil carbon inventories and carbon-13 on a latitude transect in Siberia

ID MICROBIAL PROCESSES; ORGANIC-CARBON; DISCRIMINATION; CO2
AB We present soil organic carbon (SOC) inventories and carbon isotope compositions from over 900 samples collected in areas of minimally disturbed mature vegetation on freely drained soils (excluding peatlands) on a 1000 km transect along the Yennisey River, central Siberia. Carbon inventories over 0-30 cm depth range widely from 1.71 to 7.05 kg m(-2). While an effect of changing climate or vegetation along the transect cannot be ruled out, the observed differences in SOC inventories are largely the result of variations in mineral soil texture, with inventories in fine-textured soils being approximately double those in coarse-textured soils. The delta(13)C values of SOC in the 0-5 cm interval ranged from -26.3 to -28.0parts per thousand, with delta(13)C values for the 5-30 cm interval being 0.9 +/- 0.8parts per thousand (1sigma) enriched in C-13 relative to the 0-5 cm samples. The average delta(13)C value for the 0-5 cm interval for all samples was -27.1 +/- 0.6parts per thousand (1sigma) and for the full 0-30 cm interval the average was -26.5 +/- 0.5parts per thousand (1sigma). In general, delta(13)C values were higher in coarse-textured soils and lower in fine-textured soils. The results of detailed sampling of soils in Pinus sylvestris forest growing on sand near the Zotino flux tower suggest an SOC inventory in these soils of 2.22 +/- 0.35 kg m(-2) over 30 cm and an average delta(13)C value of -26.3 +/- 0.2parts per thousand over the 0-5 cm depth interval and -25.9 +/- 0.3parts per thousand over 0-30 cm. Recent burning had no effect on SOC inventories, but clearing has led to an average 25% decrease on SOC inventories from 0-30 cm over 12 yr. Neither burning nor clearing had a discernible effect on the delta(13)C value of SOC.

AB Peatlands cover only about 3% of the Earth's surface and store 15-30% of the Global soil carbon as a peat. However, human intervention and climate change threatens the stability of peatlands, owing to deforest, wildfire, mining, drainage, glacial retreat, and permafrost. In our study, we modified the SWAT model to couple snow, soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission. Then the modified SWAT was used for predicting snow depth, soil temperature at different depths and carbon dioxide emission from peatlands and other land uses at Athabasca river basin, Canada. The results of the study indicated that SWAT model estimated the daily snow depth with R-2, NSE, RMSE and PBIAS values of 0.83, 0.76, 0.52 and - 2.3 in the calibration period (2006-2007) and 0.79, 0.71, 0.97 and -3.6 for the validation period (2008-2009), respectively. The SWAT model also predicted soil temperature very well at three depths (5 cm, 10 cm and 30 cm). The simulation model results also confirmed that the modified SWAT model estimates the CO2 emission at Athabasca river basin with good model fit during calibration (R-2 = 0.71, NSE = 0.67, RMSE = 2.6 and PBIAS = 3.2) and during validation (R-2 = 0.63, NSE = 0.58, RMSE = 3.1 and PBIAS = 9.3). Overall, our result confirmed that SWAT model performed well in representing the dynamics of snow depth, soil temperature and CO2 emissions in the peatlands at the Athabasca river basin.

AB In this article the results of a study on hummock-hollow complexes on Clara bog (Co, Offaly, Ireland) are presented.  The present size of the bog is the result of peat-cutting, road-building and drainage.  These activities influenced the hydrology of the western side of the bog, where the main flow of water is in a south-easterly direction.  Specific distribution patterns of nutrients are found, with PO4(3-), NO2(-), NH4+ NA+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Al3+, Zn2+ and Pb2+ having low concentrations in the centre of the bog and higher ones towards the edges; only SO4(2-) shows a reverse pattern.  General descriptions of three ombrotrophic and seven minerotrophic vegetation types are given.  Hummock-hollow complexes are found on plateaus on the bog where water flow is reduced.  A transect study of hummock-hollow complexes revealed that the distribution of Sphagnum species is best explained by the height of the moss surface above the water-table.  Other important ecofactors are the concentrations of Ca2+, Mn2+ and PO4(3-).  Since the hydraulic conductivity is high in the acrotelm, the water-table acts as a plane below the microtopographical elements.  Ecotope breadth and overlap calculations for height above the water-table showed that both extremes of the gradient are occupied by specialists while the slope is occupied by generalists.  Similar calculations for PO4(3-), Mn2+ and Ca2+ showed that Sphagnum species did not compete for them.  This suggests that these ecofactors are dependent on the physical and chemical properties of the hummock-hollow structure.  Analysis of nutrient concentrations in Sphagnum plants showed that the relative composition reflects the supply by wet deposition.  The absolute amounts, however, are determined by the physiological properties of the individual species.

AB Knowledge about nitrate transformation processes and how they are affected by different plants is essential in order to reduce the loss of valuable N fertiliser as well as to prevent environmental pollution due to nitrate leaching or N2O emission after fertilisation or the reflooding of degraded fens with nitrate-containing municipal sewage. Therefore four microcosm N-15 tracer experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of common wetland plants (Phalaris arundinacea, Phragmites australis) combined with different soil moisture conditions (from dry to reflooded) on nitrate turnover processes. At the end of experiment, the total formation of gaseous N compounds was calculated using the N-15 balance method. In two experiments (wet and reflooded soil conditions) the N2O and N-2 emissions were also directly determined.
   Our results show that in degraded fen soils, which process mainly takes place-denitrification or transformation into organic N compounds-is determined by the soil moisture conditions. Under dry soil moisture conditions (water filled pore space: 31%) up to 80% of the N-15 nitrate added was transformed into organic N compounds. This transformation process is not affected by plant growth. Under reflooded conditions (water filled pore space: 100%), the total gaseous N losses were highest (77-95% of the N-15-nitrate added) and the transformation into organic N compounds was very low (1.8% of N-15 nitrate added). Under almost all soil conditions plant growth reduced the N losses by 20-25% of the N-15 nitrate added due to plant uptake. The N-2 emissions exceeded the N2O emissions by a factor of 10-20 in planted soil, and as much as 30 in unplanted soil. In the treatments planted with Phragmites australis, N2O emission was about two times higher than in the corresponding implanted treatment. 15% of the N2O and N-2 formed was transported via the Phragmites shoots from the soil into the atmosphere. By contrast, Phalaris arundinacea did not affect N2O emissions and no emission via the shoots was observed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from agricultural farming practice contribute significantly to European GHG inventories. For example, CO2 is emitted when grassland is converted to cropland or when peatlands are drained and cultivated. N2O emissions result from fertilization. Enabling farmers to reduce their GHG emissions requires sufficient information about its pressure-impact relations as well as incentives, such as regulations and funding, that support climate-friendly agricultural management. This paper discusses potentials to improve the supply of information on: farm-specific climate services or impacts, present policy incentives in Germany and England that support climate-friendly farm management and related adaptation requirements. Tools which have been developed for a farm environmental management software (to be added after review because of potential identification) are presented. These tools assess CO2 emissions from grassland conversion to cropland and peatland cultivation, as well as N2O emissions from nitrogen fertilization. As input data, the CO2 tool requires a classification of soil types according to soil organic carbon storage. The input data based on soil profile samples was compared with reference data from the literature. The N2O tool relies on farm data concerning fertilization. These tools were tested on three farms in order to determine their viability with respect to the availability of required data and the differentiation of results, which determines how well site-specific conservation measures can be identified. Assessing CO2 retention function of grassland conservation to cropland on the test farms leads to spatially differentiated results (similar to 100 to similar to 900 potentially mitigated t CO2 ha(-1)). Assessed N2O emissions varied from 0.41 to 1.1 t CO(2)eq. ha(-1) a(-1). The proposed methods support policies that promote a more differentiated funding of climate conservation measures. Conservation measures and areas can be selected so that they will have the greatest mitigation effects. However, even though present policy instruments in Germany and England, such as Cross Compliance and agri-environmental measures, have the potential to reduce agricultural GHG, they do not appear to guide measures effectively or site-specifically. In order to close this gap, agri-environmental measures with the potential to support climate protection should be spatially optimized. Additionally, the wetland restoration measures which are most effective in reducing GHG emissions should be included in funding schemes.

   DYNAMICS
AB In Central Europe, most bogs have a history of drainage and many of them are currently being restored. Success of restoration as well as greenhouse gas exchange of these bogs is influenced by environmental stress factors as drought and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We determined the methane and nitrous oxide exchange of sites in the strongly decomposed center and less decomposed edge of the Pietzmoor bog in NW Germany in 2004. Also, we examined the methane and nitrous oxide exchange of mesocosms from the center and edge before, during, and following a drainage experiment as well as carbon dioxide release from disturbed unfertilized and nitrogen fertilized surface peat. In the field, methane fluxes ranged from 0 to 3.8 mg m(-2) h(-1) and were highest from hollows. Field nitrous oxide fluxes ranged from 0 to 574 mu gm(-2) h(-1) and were elevated at the edge. A large Eriophorum vaginatum tussock showed decreasing nitrous oxide release as the season progressed. Drainage of mesocosms decreased methane release to 0, even during rewetting. There was a tendency for a decrease of nitrous oxide release during drainage and for an increase in nitrous oxide release during rewetting. Nitrogen fertilization did not increase decomposition of surface peat. Our examinations suggest a competition between vascular vegetation and denitrifiers for excess nitrogen. We also provide evidence that the von Post humification index can be used to explain nitrous oxide release from bogs, if the role of vascular vegetation is also considered. An assessment of the greenhouse gas release from nitrogen saturated restoring bogs needs to take into account elevated release from fresh Sphagnum peat as well as from sedges growing on decomposed peat. Given the high atmospheric nitrogen deposition, restoration will not be able to achieve an oligotrophic ecosystem in the short term.

AB A partially peat-extracted coastal bog contaminated by seawater was barren and required revegetation as a wetland. Peat fields were rectangular in shape, cambered in cross-section profile, and separated by drainage ditches. Common to all peat fields were symmetrical patterns in micro-topography with slopes between differences in elevation. Saline non-waterlogged slopes of similar to 5% occurred as a symmetrical pair on each side of the crest of the cambered profile, at one end of each peat field. Three rows were laid across this slope (Top, Middle, and Bottom rows) and transplanted with naturally-growing plant species with their sand substrate, in three experiments, and grown for a year. In the Spartina pectinata experiment, bare root stem sections were also planted. Another experiment was conducted to determine changes in the characteristics of a volume of sand when incubated in saline peat fields. We found the salinity of peat increased with moisture downslope, and pH decreased with increase in salinity. S. pectinata grew best when planted with its sand substrate compared with bare root stem section, and when planted in Bottom rows. Juncus balticus had excellent growth in all rows. Unexpectedly, Festuca rubra that was inconspicuous beneath the J. balticus canopy in the natural donor site grew densely within the J. balticus sods. Agrostis stolonifera grew well but seemed to show intolerance to the surrounding acidic peat by curling up its stolons. The pH of the incubated sand volume was much higher than the surrounding peat. These studies suggest that recognition of plant niches and pH manipulation are important in the revegetation of disturbed Sphagnum peatlands that are found abundantly in the northern hemisphere. Results are also relevant to the reclamation of other disturbed lands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In North America, mulching of vacuum-harvested sites combined with blocking of the drainage system is widely used for peatland restoration to accelerate Sphagnum establishment. However, peat extraction in fen peatlands or exposure of deeper minerotrophic peat layers results in soil chemistry that is less suitable for re-establishment of Sphagnum moss. In this situation, restoration of plant species characteristic of minerotrophic peatlands is desirable to return the site to a carbon accumulating system. In these cases, it may be worthwhile to maintain spontaneously revegetating species as part of restoration if they provide desirable ecosystem functions. We studied the role of six spontaneously recolonizing vegetation communities for methane (CH4) emissions and pore water CH4 concentration for two growing seasons (2008 and 2009) at an abandoned minerotrophic peatland in southeastern Quebec. We then compared the results with bare peat and adjacent natural fen vegetation. Communities dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex aquatilis and Typha latifolia had CH4 flux an order of magnitude greater than other cutover vegetation types and natural sites. In contrast, Scirpus atrocinctus and Equisetum arvense had CH4 emission rates lower than natural hollow vegetation. We found seasonal average water table and vegetation volume had significant correlation with CH4 flux. Water table and soil temperature were significantly correlated with CH4 flux at plots where the water table was near or above the surface. Pore water CH4 concentration suggests that CH4 is being produced at the cutover peatland and that low measured fluxes likely result from substantial oxidation of CH4 in the unsaturated zone. Understanding ecosystem functions of spontaneously recolonizing species on cutover fens can be used to help make decisions about the inclusion of these communities for future restoration measures.

AB To evaluate the effects of dissolved organic carbon on sorption of 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) and 4-bromoaniline (4-BA) on soils, batch sorption experiments were carried out. The soil used was a typical calcareous soil from southeastern Spain. Two different types of dissolved organic carbon were used, that is, dissolved organic carbon extracts from a commercial peat (DOC-PE) and high-purity tannic acid (DOC-TA). The experiments were carried out in a 0.01 M CaCl2 aqueous medium at 25 degrees C. The results obtained from the sorption experiments show that the presence of both DOC-PE and DOC-TA, over a concentration range of 15-100 mg 1(-1), produced in all cases, an increase in the amount of 3,4-DCA and 4-BA adsorbed on the soil studied.

AB We summed estimates of the carbon balance of forests, grasslands, arable lands and peatlands to obtain country-specific estimates of the terrestrial carbon balance during the 1990s. Forests and grasslands were a net sink for carbon, whereas croplands were carbon sources in all European countries. Hence, countries dominated by arable lands tended to be losing carbon from their terrestrial ecosystems, whereas forest-dominated countries tended to be sequestering carbon. In some countries, draining and extraction of peatlands caused substantial reductions in the net carbon balance.
   Net terrestrial carbon balances were typically an order of magnitude smaller than the fossil fuel-related carbon emissions. Exceptions to this overall picture were countries where population density and industrialization are small. It is, however, of utmost importance to acknowledge that the typically small net carbon balance represents the small difference between two large but opposing fluxes: uptake by forests and grasslands and losses from arable lands and peatlands. This suggests that relatively small changes in either or both of these large component fluxes could induce large effects on the net total, indicating that mitigation schemes should not be discarded a priori.
   In the absence of carbon-oriented land management, the current net carbon uptake is bound to decline soon. Protecting it will require actions at three levels; a) maintaining the current sink activity of forests, b) altered agricultural management practices to reduce the emissions from arable soils or turn into carbon sinks and c) protecting current large reservoirs (wetlands and old forests), since carbon is lost more rapidly than sequestered.

AB Peatlands are among the largest long-term soil carbon stores, but their degradation can lead to significant carbon losses. This study considers the carbon budget of peat-covered sites after restoration, following degradation by past wildfires. The study measured the carbon budget of eight sites: four restored-revegetated sites, two unrestored bare soil control sites, and two intact vegetated controls over two years (2006-2008). The study considered the following flux pathways: dissolved organic carbon (DOC); particulate organic carbon (POC); dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2); primary productivity; net ecosystem respiration, and methane (CH4). The study shows that unrestored, bare peat sites can have significant carbon losses as high as 522 +/- 3 tonnes C/km(2)/yr. Most sites showed improved carbon budgets (decreased source and/or increased sink of carbon) after restoration; this improvement was mainly in the form of a reduction in the size of the net carbon source, but for one restored site the measured carbon budget after four years of restoration was greater than observed for vegetated controls. The carbon sequestration benefit of peatland restoration would range between 122 and 833 tonnes C/km(2)/yr. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In 1971, a series of five afforestation trials were established along a north-south gradient on open peatlands in Sweden. All areas were drained, fertilized and planted with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Survival and height of the planted trees as well as the amount of natural establishment, i.e. downy birch (Betula pubescens), silver birch (Betula pendula), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and other deciduous species: (e.g. Salix sp., Sorbus aucuparia), by seeding from nearby forests were measured 18-22 years later. The amount of naturally established trees exceeded the number of living planted trees in all five areas. Next to downy birch, Scots pine was the most common naturally established species. Large variations in both amount and height of natural establishment were found along the climatic gradient. Planted trees were taller than naturally established trees, except for the northernmost area. Number and height of naturally established trees correlated positively to closeness to nearest forest and to nearest ditch. These trees also responded positively to PK fertilization in the three southernmost areas. In the two northernmost areas no such response was found. It was concluded that natural seeding from neighbouring forests can be counted on and recommended in afforestation of low-productive peatlands in Sweden, provided that downy birch is accepted as a dominant tree species.

AB Mobilization of soil/sediment organic carbon into inland waters constitutes a substantial, but poorly-constrained, component of the global carbon cycle. Radiocarbon (C-14) analysis has proven a valuable tool in tracing the sources and fate of mobilized carbon, but aquatic C-14 studies in permafrost regions rarely detect 'old' carbon (assimilated from the atmosphere into plants and soil prior to AD1950). The emission of greenhouse gases derived from old carbon by aquatic systems may indicate that carbon sequestered prior to AD1950 is being destabilized, thus contributing to the 'permafrost carbon feedback' (PCF). Here, we measure directly the C-14 content of aquatic CO2, alongside dissolved organic carbon, in headwater systems of the western Canadian Arctic-the first such concurrent measurements in the Arctic. Age distribution analysis indicates that the age of mobilized aquatic carbon increased significantly during the 2014 snow-free season as the active layer deepened. This increase in age was more pronounced in DOC, rising from 101-228 years before sampling date (a 120%-125% increase) compared to CO2, which rose from 92-151 years before sampling date (a 59%-63% increase). 'Pre-industrial' aged carbon (assimilated prior to similar to AD1750) comprised 15%-40% of the total aquatic carbon fluxes, demonstrating the prevalence of old carbon to Arctic headwaters. Although the presence of this old carbon is not necessarily indicative of a net positive PCF, we provide an approach and baseline data which can be used for future assessment of the PCF.

AB There have been widespread attempts to rewet peatlands in Europe and elsewhere in the world to restore their unique biodiversity as well as their important function as nutrient and carbon sinks. However, changes in hydrological regime and therefore oxygen availability likely alter the abundance of enzyme-inhibiting polyphenolic compounds, which have been suggested as a "latch" preventing large amounts of carbon from being released into the atmosphere by microbial mineralization. In recent years, a variety of factors have been identified that appear to weaken that latch including not only oxygen, but also pH. In minerotrophic fens, it is unknown if long-term peat mineralization during decades of drainage and intense agricultural use causes an enrichment or a decline of enzyme-inhibiting polyphenols. To address this, we collected peat samples and fresh roots of dominating plants (i.e., the peat parent material) from the upper 20cm peat layer in 5 rewetted and 6 natural fens and quantified total phenolic content as well as hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Polyphenols from less decomposed peat and living roots served partly as an internal standard for polyphenol analysis and to run enzyme inhibition tests. As hypothesized, we found the polyphenol content in highly decomposed peat to be eight times lower than in less decomposed peat, while condensed tannin content was 50 times lower in highly degraded peat. In addition, plant tissue polyphenol contents differed strongly between peat-forming plant species, with the highest amount found in roots of Carex appropinquata at 450 mg g(-1) dry mass, and lowest in Sphagnum spp. at 39 mg g(-1) dry mass: a 10-fold difference. Despite large and clear differences in peat and porewater chemistry between natural and rewetted sites, enzyme activities determined with Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis and peat degradation were not significantly correlated, indicating no simple linear relationship between polyphenol content and microbial activity. Still, samples with low contents of polyphenols and condensed tannins showed the highest microbial activities as measured with FDA.

ID COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; WATER-QUALITY; GRADIENT; ECOLOGY; PH
AB Cranberry agriculture is a major land use in parts of the New Jersey Pinelands, USA. We compared the composition of genus-level macroinvertebrate assemblages collected from three habitats (muck, vegetated muck, and woody debris) in 12 New Jersey Pinelands blackwater streams draining forest, abandoned-cranberry bogs, and active-cranberry bogs and evaluated whether variations in macroinvertebrate assemblages were related to differences in land uses within the associated drainage basins. All 12 streams were relatively slow moving and acidic, with low conductance values and dissolved-oxygen concentrations. Muck was the dominant substrate at most stream sites. Many of the taxa that we encountered are adapted to lentic habitats, slow-moving lotic habitats, or low-oxygen environments. Macroinvertebrate composition differed significantly between the active-cranberry streams and the other two stream types and was associated with a complex environmental gradient represented by variations in dissolved oxygen, temperature, specific conductance, stream width, and woody debris. Overall, the effect of stream type appeared to overshadow that of the three different habitats. Although we cannot conclude that subtle between-site differences in dissolved oxygen were responsible for variations in community composition, many of the genera associated with the forest and abandoned-bog/active-cranberry ends of the community gradient are reported to have contrasting tolerances to low-oxygen levels. The relationship between reduced canopy cover and both lower woody-debris cover and higher stream temperatures, which can influence dissolved-oxygen levels, was most likely related to forest-canopy removal associated with historic- and active-cranberry agriculture.

   AFTER IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT

AB Wetlands in the Russian Forest Fund occupy more than 12 % of the country's territory exceeding 100 min ha. These are primarily afforested swamps with low-quality forest stands. A significant part of raised bogs is generally forestless. Meanwhile, about 60 % of the eutrophic and mesotrophic swamps are potentially rich. Here, only excess of water interferes with successful forest growth. The world forestry has accumulated wide experience in regulation of soil water retention through irrigation improvement and drainage. In Russia there are classic examples when stands of the 1st quality class grew in the large (several thousands of hectares) areas after irrigation improvement. One such case is the Kheynovskoye swamp with an area of over 2 ths. ha located in the Lisino training and experimental forest of the Saint-Petersburg State Forest Technical University and drained in 1847. However, there are enough cases of unsuccessful drainage. The better half of the drained swamps before drainage were grown over with forests. Irrigation improvement has turned around the growth conditions of all stands existed before drainage, but in poor eutrophic swamps forest growth is insufficient. The research purpose was to study brand new stands in the drained territory taking into account the whole formation cycle of the biotope and its change with time. In order to get that done, a pilot plot was laid out on a eutrophic-mcsotrophic treeless peat. where drainage was carried out using a frequent network of small grooves (furrows). They were dug with the help of a double moldboard (trench digger) and directed into the channels of the drainage network, thus providing for constant water drainage. Forest plantations were laid out on the layers formed along the furrows with the participation of the author. We had been assessing changes in the stand condition each 5-10 years for almost 60 years. The studies have shown that in the first years after removal of excess water and better soil warming, sedimentation and depletion of peat occurred. At a depth of 0.4-0.5 m in 20 years after planting the trees, the depth of peat decreased by almost 2 times. The living ground cover has changed under the influence of drainage and the developed stand. The initial (swamp) type of soil formation was replaced with soddy soil. High-quality heavy-producing plantation was formed. When comparing the parameters of the created artificial plantation with the stands of natural origin according to the growth course tables, it was found that the stock of the created stands at the age of 50 is almost twice higher than the stock of natural stands. It can be assumed that when growing wood pulp for its intended purposes in 100 years two yields can be harvested. Changes in peat soil have taken place during the last 50 years. The carbon (C) content decreased and the total nitrogen (N) content increased due to the intensive decomposition of peat, as evidenced by the decrease in the ratio of C:N. Structure developed in peat soil. The beginning of podzol-forming is noticed. Probably, the actual and hydrolytic acidity have increased due to the needle litter.

AB Carbon isotope composition, photosynthetic gas exchange, and nitrogen content were measured in leaves of three varieties of Metrosideros polymorpha growing in sites presenting a variety of precipitation, temperature and edaphic regimes. The eight populations studied could be divided into two groups on the basis of their mean foliar delta-C-13 values, one group consisting of three populations with mean delta-C-13 values ca. -26 parts per thousand and another group with delta-C-13 values ca. -28 parts per thousand. Less negative delta-C-13 values appeared to be associated with reduced physiological availability of soil moisture resulting from hypoxic conditions at a poorly drained high elevation bog site and from low precipitation at a well-drained, low elevation leeward site. Gas exchange measurements indicated that foliar delta-C-13 and intrinsic water-use efficiency were positively correlated. Maximum photosynthetic rates were nearly constant while maximum stomatal conductance varied substantially in individuals with foliar delta-C-13 ranging from -29 to -24 parts per thousand. In contrast with the patterns of delta-C-13 observed, leaf nitrogen content appeared to be genetically determined and independent of site characteristics. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency was nearly constant over the range of delta-C-13 observed, suggesting that a compromise between intrinsic water- and N-use efficiency did not occur. In one population variations in foliar delta-C-13 and gas exchange with leaf cohort age, caused the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 predicted from gas exchange and that calculated from delta-C-13 to be in close agreement only in the two youngest cohorts of fully expanded leaves. The results indicated that with suitable precautions concerning measurement protocol, foliar delta-C-13 and gas exchange measurements were reliable indicators of potential resource use efficiency by M. polymorpha along environmental gradients.

AB This paper reports Pt content of surficial media associated with Pt-rich chromitites in the dunite core of the Tulameen ultramafic complex. Platinum content of the -212 mum fraction of soils and sediments was determined by fire assay-inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy. C-horizon soils on dunite colluvium (mean: 24.2% MgO), locally-derived dunitic till (16.5% MgO) and exotic non-dunitic till (5.7% MgO) have median Pt concentrations of 88 ppb, 36 ppb and 8 ppb, respectively. Corresponding medians in ashed LFH horizons are 65 ppb, 13 ppb and 7 ppb Pt. Platinum values of 8-91 ppb are found in sediments from the small stream that drains the area. Stream and bog waters contain less than 1 ppt to a maximum of 2.45 ppt Pt.
   Geochemical patterns for Pt indicate that glacial transport and mass wasting are the dominant processes that control distribution of Pt in soils on Grasshopper Mountain. There is also some (slight) evidence for very limited hydromorphic mobility of Pt and its accumulation in bogs. During routine exploration geochemical programmes the considerable local variability in soil parent materials and related variations in background concentrations of Pt need to be taken into account in evaluating the significance of Pt values. This requires careful identification of soil parent materials. Soil MgO content provides a useful index of their dunite content for this purpose.

AB To assess the influence of storage dynamics and nonlinearities in hydrological connectivity on time-variant stream water ages, we used a new long-term record of daily isotope measurements in precipitation and streamflow to calibrate and test a parsimonious tracer-aided runoff model. This can track tracers and the ages of water fluxes through and between conceptual stores in steeper hillslopes, dynamically saturated riparian peatlands, and deeper groundwater; these represent the main landscape units involved in runoff generation. Storage volumes are largest in groundwater and on the hillslopes, though most dynamic mixing occurs in the smaller stores in riparian peat. Both streamflow and isotope variations are generally well captured by the model, and the simulated storage and tracer dynamics in the main landscape units are consistent with independent measurements. The model predicts that the average age of stream water is similar to 1.8 years. On a daily basis, this varies between similar to 1 month in storm events, when younger waters draining the hillslope and riparian peatland dominates, to around 4 years in dry periods when groundwater sustains flow. This variability reflects the integration of differently aged water fluxes from the main landscape units and their mixing in riparian wetlands. The connectivity between these spatial units varies in a nonlinear way with storage that depends upon precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions. This, in turn, determines the spatial distribution of flow paths and the integration of their contrasting nonstationary ages. This approach is well suited for constraining process-based modeling in a range of northern temperate and boreal environments.

AB Multiple analyses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from pore waters were conducted to define the processes that govern carbon balance in peatlands: (1) source, reactivity, and transport of DOC with respect to vegetation, peat, and age of carbon substrate, (2) reactivity of DOC with respect to molecular size, and (3) lability to photoxidation of surficial DOC. We found that surface organic production fuels heterotrophic respiration at depth in advection-dominated peatlands, especially in fens. Fen DOC was C-14 enriched relative to the surrounding fen peat, and fen respiration products were similar to this enriched DOC indicating that DOC was the main microbial substrate. Bog DOC was more variable showing either enrichment in C-14 at depth or C-14 values that follow peat values. This variability in bogs is probably controlled by the relative importance of vertical transport of labile carbon substrates within the peat profile versus DOC production from bog peat. These results extended our set of observations to 10 years at one bog-fen pair and add two additional bog-fen pairs to our series of observations. Anaerobic incubations of peat, rinsed free of residual DOC, produced DOC and respiration products that were strikingly similar to the peat values in a bog and two fens. This result demonstrated conclusively that downward advection is the process responsible for the presence of modern DOC found at depth in the peat column. Fen DOC has lower C/N values and up to twice as much LMW (<1 kDa) DOC as bogs due to differences in organic inputs and greater microbial processing. Fluorescence irradiation experiments showed that fen DOC is more photolabile than bog DOC.

AB Changes in atmospheric temperature and lowering in water-table (WT) are expected to affect peatland nutrient dynamics. To understand the response of peatland nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics to warming and drainage in a continental wooded-bog of hummock-hollow microtopography, we compared three sites: (a) control, (b) recently drained (2-3years; experimental), and (c) older drained (12-13years; drained), during 2013. The WT was lowered at experimental and drained sites to 74 and 120cm, respectively, whereas a warming of similar to 1 degrees C was created at one half of the microforms using open-top chambers. Responses of peat total inorganic nitrogen (TIN=nitrate nitrogen [NO3--N]+ammonium nitrogen [NH4+-N]) and phosphate-P (PO43--P) pools and vegetation C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15 to the experimental treatments were investigated across sites/microforms and over time. Peat TIN available and extractable pools increased with deepening of WT and over time and were greater at hummocks relative to hollows. In contrast, the PO4 pools increased with short-term drainage but reverted to very close to their original (control) nutrient values in the longer term. The WT and warming driven change in the peat TIN pool was strongly reflected in the vascular vegetation C:N ratio and shrub C-13 and N-15, whereas moss nutrient dynamics did not vary between sites. Therefore, we suggest that atmospheric warming combined with WT deepening can increase availability of mineral N and P, which then can be reflected in vascular vegetation and hence modify the productivity and ecosystem functioning of the northern midlatitude continental wooded bogs in the long term.

AB A database was constructed of tree-anchorage measurements from almost 2000 trees from 12 conifer species that were mechanically overturned on 34 sites in the United Kingdom between 1960 and 2000. Anchorage was compared among species, soil groups (freely-draining mineral, gleyed mineral, peaty mineral, and deep peat) and root depth classes (shallow, < 40 cm; medium, 40-80 cm; and deep, > 80 cm) using regressions of critical turning moment against stem mass. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) was used as a benchmark because it formed the largest part of the database and was the only species with all soil-group and depth-class combinations. Anchorage of Sitka spruce was strongest on,peat and poorest on gleyed mineral soils. Deep rooting increased critical turning moments by 10%-15% compared with trees of equivalent mass with shallower roots. Significantly better anchorage than Sitka spruce was found for grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl. ex D. Don) Lindl.), with various rooting depths on freely draining and gleyed mineral soils and for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) on medium-depth mineral soil. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) had poorer anchorage than Sitka spruce over a range of soil groups and root depth classes. Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) on shallow gleyed mineral soil, and Corsican pine (Pinus nigra subsp. laricio (Poir.) Maire) on medium depth mineral soil, also had poorer anchorage. Other combinations had similar anchorage to the equivalent Sitka spruce. These results are discussed with respect to the development of forest wind-risk models.

TI Sensitivity maps for impacts of land management on an extreme flood in
   the Hodder catchment, UK
SO PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH

DT Article
DE Flooding; Adjoint modelling; Catchment modelling; Land use management
ID RUNOFF; PEAT; ENGLAND
AB It is increasingly recognised that the management of land and the management of water are strongly interdependent, and that integrated management approaches are needed. There is evidence that modern land management practices have an effect on runoff generation in rural upland areas, so there is the potential to use land management control as a tool in flood risk mitigation programmes. Flooding from historical extreme rainfall events must be considered when designing mitigation programmes, especially if the designs have to take into account the possibility that such events will become more frequent in the future.
   The largest 90 min rainfall ever recorded in the UK was 117 mm, recorded in 1967 in the Dunsop tributary (25 km(2)) of the Hodder catchment, northwest England. Extensive land management changes have recently been made in the catchment, including peat restoration, tree planting and reductions in sheep stocking density, and the analysis of the flooding in 1967 has been undertaken as part of a wider study on the potential impact of the recent changes.
   A method is demonstrated in which maps of sensitivity are plotted which show how peak flows for extreme events are affected by spatial patterns of changes in runoff generation. This method uses a gridded model for runoff generation containing an embedded hydraulic model of the river network which can calculate sensitivities efficiently and accurately using reverse algorithmic differentiation. The modelling examines the sensitivity of the hydrograph peak at the catchment outlet to changes in flashy runoff generation, which can be affected by land management practices including the blocking of open drainage channels in peat moorland. It is concluded that, as a result of hydraulic and geomorphologic dispersion in the network, changes in land management that affect the flashiness of runoff generation at small scales would probably have had only a relatively minor effect on the flow peaks at the outlet from the catchment during the 1967 extreme event.

AB Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.

TI Geochemical controls on peatland pore water from the Hudson Bay Lowland:
   A multivariate statistical approach
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
ID NORTHERN MINNESOTA; BOG; GROUNDWATER; MIRES; FEN
AB Pore-water samples were collected in the Albany River drainage basin of the Hudson Bay Lowland. The chemistry of these samples was evaluated using bivariate plots, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis to determine the importance of groundwater and to evaluate geochemical processes within the peat. The transport of dissolved constituents from the mineral soil into the peat column is a dominant control on peat pore-water chemistry. Peatland landforms have different signatures for pore-water chemistry; bogs are characterized by elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, CH4, SiO2, K+ and larger mineral ion balance errors, whereas fens are characterized by their higher pH and alkalinity. Large mineral ion balance errors (up to 99%), the inverse relationship between pH and dissolved organic carbon, and the positive correlation between mineral ion balance error and dissolved organic carbon show that organic acids are important anions in bog pore waters. Methane concentrations and SO42- concentration are inversely related, suggesting that SO42- inhibits CH4 production. Feat pore water at several locations contains high concentrations of marine salts (SO42-, Cl-, and Na+) in the lower half of the peat column, indicating that the marine sediments contain sea salts. We suggest that SO42- from these marine sediments may reduce methane production in portions of the Hudson Bay Lowland.

AB Wetland restoration on peat islands previously drained for agriculture has potential to reverse land subsidence and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as peat accretes. However, the emission of methane could potentially offset the greenhouse gas benefits of captured carbon. As microbial communities play a key role in governing wetland greenhouse gas fluxes, we are interested in how microbial community composition and functions are associated with wetland hydrology, biogeochemistry, and methane emission, which is critical to modeling the microbial component in wetland methane fluxes and to managing restoration projects for maximal carbon sequestration. Here, we couple sequence-based methods with biogeochemical and greenhouse gas measurements to interrogate microbial communities from a pilot-scale restored wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, revealing considerable spatial heterogeneity even within this relatively small site. A number of microbial populations and functions showed strong correlations with electron acceptor availability and methane production; some also showed a preference for association with plant roots. Marker gene phylogenies revealed a diversity of major methane-producing and -consuming populations and suggested novel diversity within methanotrophs. Methanogenic archaea were observed in all samples, as were nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria, indicating that no single terminal electron acceptor was preferred despite differences in energetic favorability and suggesting spatial microheterogeneity and microniches. Notably, methanogens were negatively correlated with nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria and were most abundant at sampling sites with high peat accretion and low electron acceptor availability, where methane production was highest.
   IMPORTANCE Wetlands are the largest nonanthropogenic source of atmospheric methane but also a key global carbon reservoir. Characterizing belowground microbial communities that mediate carbon cycling in wetlands is critical to accurately predicting their responses to changes in land management and climate. Here, we studied a restored wetland and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemistry, methane production, and microbial communities, largely associated with the wetland hydraulic design. We observed patterns in microbial community composition and functions correlated with biogeochemistry and methane production, including diverse microorganisms involved in methane production and consumption. We found that methanogenesis gene abundance is inversely correlated with genes from pathways exploiting other electron acceptors, yet the ubiquitous presence of genes from all these pathways suggests that diverse electron acceptors contribute to the energetic balance of the ecosystem. These investigations represent an important step toward effective management of wetlands to reduce methane flux to the atmosphere and enhance belowground carbon storage.

TI Peat Fibers and Finely Ground Peat Powder for Application in Asphalt

AB In this study, the feasibility of a natural peat fiber and finely ground peat powder as a modifier for bitumen was investigated. Initially, the as-received peat material was characterized in detail: the material was ground to various degrees, separated into fiber and powder fractions, and the gradation of the powder fraction as well as the size of the fibers were determined. A possible solubility in bitumen, the moisture content, and the density of both fractions were evaluated, and a limited chemical characterization of the fibers was conducted. Secondly, the rheological behavior of the powder and the fibers when blended with bitumen was evaluated. Additionally, a limited asphalt study was conducted. The rheological data showed the stiffening effects of the powder fraction and the presence of a fiber network, which were obvious as a plateau modulus towards lower frequencies. The fiber network was strain-dependent and showed elastic effects. This was further confirmed by the multiple stress creep recovery (MSCRT) tests. These tests also indicated that the fibers should improve the rutting resistance, although it was not possible to confirm this in asphalt rutting tests. Asphalt drainage tests demonstrated that adding dry peat, whether this is ground or not, is effective in reducing the binder drainage. However, the data also revealed that the amount of added peat fibers and powder should be limited to avoid difficulties in the compaction of these asphalt mixes.

TI The quality of Borkovicka blata surface waters

DT Article
DE peat land; quality of surface waters; effect of peat water basin
AB In the time sequence of eight years chemical composition of surface waters of Borkovicka blata was investigated in two-months' intervals and after spring snowmelt. 12 288 laboratory determinations were evaluated (pH, all organic substances, oxidizability [O-2 consumption], humine substances, anions NO3-, NO2-, PO43-, Cl-, SO42- and HCO3-, cations NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and Fe2+. It was found out that water pH of main recipient of Borkovicka blata (Blatske stopky) at the inlet into peat locus (pH 7.02) is equal to water pH before orifice into the river Luznice (pH 7.04). In the time sequence of eight years acidification of surface waters (1st year - 6.90, 8th year - 6.65), drainage waters (1st year - 6.40, 2nd year - 5.81), as well as precipitation waters (1st year - 7.0, 2nd year - 6.0) was recorded. The content of organic substances in surface waters is affected by sewerage wastewater from villages and plants of animal production. Humine substances were most present in stagnant water in mining-devastated part of peat land, called Kozohludky, less in partially disturbed spa peloid and the least in undisturbed reservation. Regarding NO3-, NH4+, Cl-, PO43-, Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+, more contaminated are tributaries from mineral water basin. NO3- in stagnant water of the deposit and its surface streams did not exceed 15 mg. Drainage waters had increased NO3- content in dependence on the position of drains. In the position of drains in the mud layer the content of NO3- in drainage water is 31.2 mg.l(-1), in the position on transition to mud into permeable mineral substrate 75.9 mg.l(-1) and directly in permeable substrate 145.3 mg.l(-1) (on the average of eight years). This trend has been recorded in all investigated years also in the value of oxidizability, all organic substances and humine substances. Ions SO42- and Fe2+ exhibit higher contents in drainage waters from drains placed in transition from mud into mineral substrate and in the mud layer itself. The content of ion SO42- increases in the tributary from peat land (canal B) as well as in Brodsky potok with effect of municipal and agricultural wastes, but also in the brook from mineral water basin (Bechynsky potok). In evaluation of the quality of surface waters of Borkovicka blata, in association with existing reserves of quality underground sources of drinking waters, some potential risks are evident, particularly in endangering their quality. Stores of water streams of peatified water basin participate in existing, acceptable quality of surface waters of Borkovicka blata in places of their permeable bottom by buoyancy artesian water. In turn of hydraulic slope due to disproportionate drawing of artesian waters and subsequent decline of their table there is a real danger of effect on the quality due to seepage from peat locus and surface streams. The solution will consist in the compromise between the usage of the territory and intensity of collection of underground waters.

AB The theory of conductive heat transfer cannot explain different attenuations of the daily amplitude of peat temperatures (T-S) in hummocks (detectable below the 20-cm depth) and hollows (disappearing above the 10-cm depth). Large readily drained macropores in the upper fibric peat determine a large air permeability and hence may enhance heat transfer by air convection in porous media, driven by temperature gradients between hummock sides and interiors. In this study, the ecosys model was used to simulate a peat thermal regime at Mer Bleue peatland, Ontario, Canada. It was hypothesized that adding the air-convective heat transfer to conductive plus water-convective heat transfers would improve simulations of T-S. The results for T-S, ground hear fluxes, G, and sensible heat fluxes, H, modeled with and without air-convective heat transfer were tested with continuous hourly measurements from 2000 to 2004 using thermocouples, heat flux plates, and eddy covariance. Simulated air-convective heat transfer caused an average increase in G and a corresponding decrease in H of similar to 20 W m(-2) from the simulated conductive plus water-convective heat transfer. Hastened soil warming in hummocks resulted in better agreement between measured and simulated hummock T-S values with (RMSD of 2.23 degrees C) than without air-convective heat (RMSD of 2.54 degrees C). Enhanced hummock T-S caused an indirect increase in hollow T-S in the model with (RMSD of 1.68 degrees C) compared to without air-convective heat (RMSD of 1.82 degrees C). Our results suggest that air convection is probably an important mechanism of heat transfer in peat hummocks and should be included in peatland biogeochemical models.

AB Sea-level rise coupled with land subsidence from wetland drainage exposes increasingly large areas of coastal peatlands to seawater intrusion. Seawater contains high concentrations of sulfate (SO42-), which can alter the decomposition of organic matter thereby releasing organic and inorganic solutes from peat. In this study, a flow-through reactor system was used in order to examine the transport of SO42- through peat as well as its effect on solute release. Moderately-decomposed fen peat samples received input solutions with SO42- concentrations of 0, 100, 700, and 2,700mg L-1; sample effluent was analyzed for a variety of geochemical parameters including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) as well as the concentrations of major cations and anions. The input solution remained anoxic throughout the experiment; however, no signs of a pronounced SO42- reduction were detected in the effluent. SO42- transport in the fen peat resembled non-reactive bromide (Br-) transport, indicating that in the absence of SO42- reduction the anion may be considered a conservative tracer. However, slightly elevated concentrations of DOC and TDN, associated with raised SO42- levels, suggest the minor desorption of organic acids through anion exchange. An increased solute release due to stimulated decomposition processes, including SO42- reduction, was observed for samples with acetate as an additional marine carbon source included in their input solution. The solute release of peats with different degrees of decomposition differed greatly under SO42--enriched conditions where strongly-decomposed fen peat samples released the highest concentrations of DOC, DIC and TDN.

AB This study examines the influence of fire-induced deforestation in well-drained conifer sites on the development of adjacent, surviving spruce stands in peatlands at the arctic tree line (northern Quebec). Tree-ring and growth-form patterns of cross-dated black spruce (Picea mariana) remains in peat were used to analyze stand responses in two contrasting topographical settings: a moderately protected valley-bottom peatland, and an exposed hilltop peatland. Dense, old-growth spruce populations occupied the studied peatlands between the 11th and 16th centuries, with stunted and erect spruce dominating the hilltop and the valley sites, respectively. Spruce continued to colonize the peatlands as long as the adjacent well-drained sites were occupied by forest trees able to attenuate the damaging effect of winter snow-drifting conditions. The surviving conifer stands exhibited similar growth responses following deforestation of the well-drained sites by wildfire in AD 1567-1568. These responses included dieback of supranival (above snow) stems and death of trees due to drowning in permafrost-induced ponds. The postfire degradation and disappearance of the conifer stands from the peatlands were the ultimate stage of a positive feedback process triggered by a modification of the snow regime at the landscape scale. Deforestation of the well-drained sites led to reduced snow accumulation and enhanced snow-drift exposure, thus inducing permafrost aggradation and drainage impediment in the nearby peatland sites. While the hilltop conifer stand responded immediately to forest exclusion in the nearby sites, ecosystem changes in the valley peatland were delayed until AD 1580-1590, at the beginning of the Little Ice Age. Our results emphasize the sensitivity and connectedness of adjoining ecosystems to fire and frost disturbances in a changing subarctic landscape mosaic.

AB Peatland was subject to heavy drainage and degradation throughout the world and thus is now the focus of large scale restoration attempts. The monitoring of both vegetation development and balance of matter after restoration has started is indispensable, since an important objective of peatlands rewetting is the rehabilitation of their sink function. Against this background, we investigated rewetted fens in NE Germany in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the vegetation development after restoration measures. The aim of this study was to analyse the vegetation composition with multispectral and very high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We investigated two sites with different rewetting dates and also took biomass and carbon content samples for the main plant species in order to estimate nutrient storage. We tested the applicability of various satellite sensors (QuickBird, WorldView I and SPOT) and an iterative classification scheme based on decision trees for mapping several wetland plant species (e. g. Phragmites australis, Typha spp. and Carex spp.) and vegetation types. We chose three different widely used decision tree classifiers for this study: AdaBoost, See5 and Random Forest. Evaluation criteria were overall accuracy and mean class accuracy. Multispectral and very high spatial resolution satellite data and the developed method allow for the identification of the most important vegetation types in rewetted fens. All applied sensors yielded good results with overall accuracies of 85% and 92%. Some classes reached lower accuracies due to different reasons (capture date, size of training set or spatial resolution of the sensor). We found remote sensing a very valuable tool not only for the observation of the restoration success in rewetted peatland but also for the analysis of the peat accumulation potential as well as biomass and nutrient storage.

AB Permafrost soils store over half of global soil carbon (C), and northern frozen peatlands store about 10% of global permafrost C. With thaw, inundation of high latitude lowland peatlands typically increases the surface-atmosphere flux of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. To examine the effects of lowland permafrost thaw over millennial timescales, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 exchange along sites that constitute a similar to 1000 yr thaw chronosequence of thermokarst collapse bogs and adjacent fen locations at Innoko Flats Wildlife Refuge in western Alaska. Peak CH4 exchange in July (123 +/- 71 mg CH4-Cm-2 d(-1)) was observed in features that have been thawed for 30 to 70 (<100) yr, where soils were warmer than at more recently thawed sites (14 to 21 yr; emitting 1.37 +/- 0.67 mg CH4-Cm-2 d(-1) in July) and had shallower water tables than at older sites (200 to 1400 yr; emitting 6.55 +/- 2.23 mg CH4-Cm- 2 d-1 in July). Carbon lost via CH4 efflux during the growing season at these intermediate age sites was 8% of uptake by net ecosystem exchange. Our results provide evidence that CH4 emissions following lowland permafrost thaw are enhanced over decadal time scales, but limited over millennia. Over larger spatial scales, adjacent fen systems may contribute sustained CH4 emission, CO2 uptake, and DOC export. We argue that over timescales of decades to centuries, thaw features in high-latitude lowland peatlands, particularly those developed on poorly drained mineral substrates, are a key locus of elevated CH4 emission to the atmosphere that must be considered for a complete understanding of high latitude CH4 dynamics.

AB Wetland buffer zones (WBZs) are riparian areas that form a transition between terrestrial and aquatic environments and are well-known to remove agricultural water pollutants such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). This review attempts to merge and compare data on the nutrient load, nutrient loss and nutrient removal and/or retention from multiple studies of various WBZs termed as riparian mineral soil wetlands, groundwatercharged peatlands (i.e. fens) and floodplains. Two different soil types ('organic' and 'mineral'), four different main water sources ('groundwater', 'precipitation', 'surface runoff/drain discharge', and 'river inundation') and three different vegetation classes ('arboraceous', 'herbaceous' and 'aerenchymous') were considered separately for data analysis. The studied WBZs are situated within the temperate and continental climatic regions that are commonly found in northern-central Europe, northern USA and Canada. Surprisingly, only weak differences for the nutrient removal/retention capability were found if the three WBZ types were directly compared. The results of our study reveal that for example the nitrate retention efficiency of organic soils (53 +/- 28%; mean +/- sd) is only slightly higher than that of mineral soils (50 +/- 32%). Variance in load had a stronger influence than soil type on the N retention inWBZs. However, organic soils in fens tend to be sources of dissolved organic N and soluble reactive P, particularly when the fens have become degraded due to drainage and past agricultural usage. The detailed consideration of water sources indicated that average nitrate removal efficiencies were highest for ground water (76 +/- 25%) and lowest for river water (35 +/- 24%). No significant pattern for P retention emerged; however, the highest absolute removal appeared if the P source was river water. The harvesting of vegetation will minimise potential P loss from rewetted WBZs and plant biomass yield may promote circular economy value chains and provide compensation to land owners for restored land now unsuitable for conventional farming.

AB The first millennium AD encompasses the Roman period (12 BC to AD 450) and the Early Middle Ages (AD 450 to 1050). In the Netherlands, this millennium saw population growth, steep decline and subsequent revival. In addition, many changes occurred in the physical landscape, marking a transition from a mainly natural prehistorical lowland landscape to an increasingly human-affected landscape. This paper synthesises the main landscape changes and human-landscape interactions in the Netherlands during this dynamic period. The degree of landscape change is compared between the coastal plain, the delta and the Pleistocene sand area.
   Human activities caused major often unintended geomorphological changes in all studied landscapes. Landscape sensitivity to human impact, however, strongly varied as a function of preceding landscape state. The most prominent changes took place in many parts of the coastal plain, where back-barrier peatlands transformed into open tidal basins. Presence of compaction-prone peat and intensified artificial drainage led to subsidence. This precondition and slow anthropogenic forcing combined, made the area more sensitive to stochastically occurring storms, which could serve as tipping points for large-scale drowning. Eventually, major peatlands turned into tidal areas that for many centuries would remain unsuitable for habitation. Human-induced peatland subsidence also led to the formation of the new Hollandse IJssel and Lek river branches. This marked a major reorganisation of the river network in the lower Rhine-Meuse delta. In the middle and upstream parts of the delta, the landscape was more stable. Yet, settlements on the natural levees show adaption to increasing flooding frequency from the Late Roman period onwards. The settlements shifted towards higher positions, while route networks between them largely remained intact. Smaller-scale landscape changes were found in the Pleistocene sand area. Here, local sand drifting occurred, most frequently occurring close to human movement corridors. Drift sand intensity became larger as population density increased after c.AD 900.

AB Crystal Fen in north-central Maine has become well-known as a locality with numerous rare plants.  Recent observations of apparent drying and an increase in abundance of woody vegetation in the fen have led to concerns that an adjacent railroad bed and drainage ditch may be causing changes that threaten the habitat of several rare and interesting plant taxa.  A description of these changes comes from analysis of (1) aerial photographs dating from 1938 to the present; (2) characteristics of the present vegetation, including the age of living woody plants; (3) evidence of fire on the fen; and (4) the fossil-pollen and charcoal stratigraphy for the past 200 years from an area of the fen that is becoming increasingly wooded.
   Results indicate that during much of its history the fen may have been at least partially wooded, except in the area that is wettest and most open today.  Construction of the railbed in 1893, and the passing of cinder-producing steam locomotives along the tracks thereafter, apparently promoted expansion of fen vegetation by impeding drainage and by igniting occasional fires that reduced the abundance of woody stems.  Thus, the extensive open habitat where populations of some rare plants occur is, in fact, an artificial result of human activities.  Recent drier conditions post-date the construction of a drainage ditch in 1937 and the introduction of diesel-powered locomotives around 1950, which largely eliminated the ignition of fires and allowed the re-expansion of woody taxa over most of the fen.  This trend represents a partial retreat to natural conditions.
   The study demonstrates that (1) rare plants occur in a variety of habitats (open, lightly forested, and heavily forested) at Crystal Fen, suggesting that these populations would be best served by maintaining such habitat diversity; and (2) past human disturbance led to expansion of open areas, which is the habitat most suitable for some of the rare taxa.  In the future, both open fen areas and overall habitat diversity could be artificially enhanced using a variety of management practices including cutting, prescribed burning, and manipulating drainage to maintain a mixture of vegetation types.

AB Anaerobic carbon mineralization is a major regulator of soil methane production, but the relationship between these processes is variable. To explain the dynamics of this relationship a model was developed, which comprises the dynamics of alternative electron-accepters, of acetate and of methanogenic biomass. Major assumptions are: (i) alternative electron-accepters suppress methanogenesis and (ii) the rate of electron-acceptor reduction is controlled by anaerobic carbon mineralization. The model was applied to anaerobic incubation experiments with slurried soil samples from a drained and an undrained peat soil in the Netherlands to test the model and to further interpret the data. Three parameters were fitted with a Monte Carlo method, using experimentally determined time series of methane, carbon dioxide and acetate. The fitted parameters were the initial concentration of electron-acceptors, the initial concentration of methanogenic biomass and the maximum relative growth rate of methanogenic biomass. Simulated and measured time courses of methane corresponded reasonably well. The model as such stresses the importance of alternative electron-accepters. At the drained site initial alternative electron-acceptor concentrations were between 0.3 and 0.8 mol electron equivalents (el. eqv.) kg(-1) dw soil, whereas at the undrained site they were between 0.0 and 0.3 mol el. eqv. kg(-1) dw sail, depending on the experimental treatments. The sum of measured NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-) concentrations and estimated maximum Fe(3)(+) and Mn(4+) concentrations was much lower than the fitted concentrations of alternative electron-accepters. Apparently, reduction of unknown electron-accepters consumed a large part of anaerobically-mineralized carbon which, therefore, was not available for methanogenesis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Peat deposits comprise the fragmented remains of dead plant vegetation that have accumulated under waterlogged conditions. Effective stress theories developed for mineral soils are routinely applied in practice for peat, although there are fundamental issues regarding the application of conventional soil mechanics to peat, on account of its extremely high water content, fibrous nature, low shear strength and high compressibility, and also the flexible, permeable and compressible nature of the porous organic solids. This paper presents an experimental study intended to contribute to the ongoing and increasing debate about the degree to which conventional soil mechanics approaches can be applied to peat. A programme of isotropic consolidated-drained triaxial compression tests was performed on saturated fibrous peat under the same effective confining pressure, but developed by applying different cell- and back-pressure combinations. Effects of mini-structure and fibre content on mechanical response were considered by testing undisturbed, reconstituted and refined (blended) peat materials. Similar volumetric strain-time and stress-strain-time responses experienced by identically prepared triaxial specimens were persuasive regarding the applicability of the principle of effective stress to peat, although there is no firm conclusion, since significant challenges occurred in performing these tests and in interpreting the data.

AB Bord na Mona (the Irish Peat Development Corporation) began peat extraction at Bellacorick, in County Mayo, in the north-west of Ireland in 1961. The peat production area comprised 8000 ha of Atlantic blanket bog. To date, about 25% of the area has been taken out of production as the peat resources were exhausted. The cutaway landscape is heterogeneous, with some intact bog remnants among gravel hills bared through peat erosion, shallow acid highly-humified peat deposits overlying relatively level glacial till, and occasional pockets of mineral-enriched peat in depressions. The aims of the work described here are (a) to provide a baseline vegetation survey of the cutaway, (b) to test potential management tools for accelerating re-vegetation, and (c) to promote the re-establishment of peatland characteristics where possible.
   Thirteen plant communities were recorded on the cutaway bog at Bellacorick. Extensive areas of cutaway are colonised by Juncus effusus. Peatland communities have developed where the drainage of cutaway has been impeded and the water-table remains at or above the surface. Remnants of intact Atlantic blanket bog within the production area provide a local source of propagules for colonisation of adjacent bare cutaway. They also constitute locations for plants with restricted distributions within the production area.
   Experimental plots were used to show the positive impacts of (a) re-wetting of cutaway surfaces in promoting the colonisation and spread of Sphagnum, and (b) ridging of exposed gravel till that provides waterlogged and sheltered furrows in which accelerated plant colonisation takes place.
   A management plan is currently being devised for the rehabilitation of the Bellacorick cutaway. Bog remnants should be maintained as an essential part of rehabilitation management. Rehabilitation will include restoration of peat-forming conditions facilitated by waterlogging, which has been shown in experimental trials to be enhanced by dam construction, infilling of drains and surface ridging. At Bellacorick, it is evident that, with time, peat-forming conditions can be restored with minimal management and economic cost.

Concentrations of DOC in the two pools displayed similar seasonal variations, ranging from as;low as 5 mg L-1 in winter to 20 mg L-1 or more in late summer and early autumn. The ratio of hydrophilic to total DOC also showed a seasonal trend, with the highest values observed during the summer months. During the period to mid-1995, the ratio of A(340)/DOC in both pools was nearly constant, but fell by 50% following a two-month period of drought, during which time the pools were dry, remaining at the lower value throughout the remainder of the sampling period. Through a series of salt addition experiments, estimates of water flow through the pools were made during two separate periods (2 weeks and 3 weeks). The results were consistent with flows calculated using a simple rainfall-runoff model, driven by rainfall inputs, and taking into account the size and slopes of the catchment. Water flow was strongly correlated with rainfall amount and frequency, and the model could therefore be used to estimate flows; over the entire sampling period. The flows were combined with concentration data to estimate fluxes of DOC. The fluxes in 1993 and 1994 were similar (15 g m(-2) a(-1)) and showed a strong seasonality, with most carbon passing through the pools during the late summer and autumn. In 1995, a year of low rainfall and high temperatures, the flux was only 7.0 g m(-2) a(-1), increasing again to 10 g m(-2) a(-1) in 1996. The results were interpreted in terms of production of dissolvable organic matter within the catchment soils during summer, and export associated with subsequent high rainfall events. The climatic conditions of 1995 appeared to have restricted the soil production of dissolvable organic matter. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Dissolved and suspended Mn in the Kalix River, northern Sweden, were measured weekly over a period of eighteen months.  During the same period four lakes in the Kalix catchment were sampled at their outlets and in vertical profiles within the lakes, together with a stream draining a series of mires with shallow lakes.
   Snow melting in mid-May increased the dissolved Mn concentration in the river tenfold, compared with a concentration of 5-mu-g L-1 during the winter discharge (January to April).  We suggest that the increase was caused by Mn-rich mire water mixing with melting snow and being transported to the river.  Large concentrations of dissolved Mn built up in the hypolimnion of the lakes studied during the ice-covered period.  Break-up of the ice and spring-overturn in June increased the dissolved Mn concentration tenfold in lake discharge and a concomitant peak in the dissolved Mn concentration was observed in the river.  Lake-derived Mn was the dominant source for Mn in the river during this time.
   Suspended Mn in the river was hosted mainly in detrital particles during flood in May.  In mid-June, non-detrital suspended Mn started to accumulate and reached a maximum in late July and early August.  The Mn/Al ratio was 25 times higher during this period than during flood in May, suggesting the precipitation of an Mn-oxyhydroxide phase.  The precipitation of the non-detrital Mn-rich phase was correlated in time with increased temperature, increased pH, and increased concentration of suspended biogenic particles.  The precipitation of dissolved Mn was biologically mediated.  Sedimentation and mineralisation of the non-detrital Mn phase in river and lake sediments resulted in a steady increase of the dissolved Mn concentration in the river water during autumn.

AB The abundance and shale-normalised fractionation patterns of rare earth elements (REEs) were studied in 121 streams of first and second order in an area where acid sulphate soils. developed on oxidised sulphide-bearing marine sediments. are abundant. During high-water flow events in autumn, on which this study focuses, the leaching of REEs from the acid sulphate soils is extensive, resulting in high total REE concentrations (up to > 1 mg/l) in streams draining such soils exclusively. In these streams, there is a general depletion of the heavy REEs explained by preferential scavenging of the latter by oxyhydroxides in the deepest soil-profile horizons. In streams draining areas of glacial till and peat, the REE concentrations are several orders of magnitude lower. In these streams, in contrast to the REE-enriched streams, there is a depletion of light REEs explained most likely by preferential complexation of the middle and heavy REEs by dissolved humic substances.

AB Drained organic soils are anthropogenic emission hotspots of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Most studies have focused on deep peat soils and on peats with high organic carbon content. In contrast, histic Gleysols are characterized by shallow peat layers, which are left over from peat cutting activities or by peat mixed with mineral soil. It is unknown whether they emit less GHGs than deep Histosols when drained. We present the annual carbon and GHG balance of grasslands for six sites on nutrient-poor histic Gleysols with a shallow (30 cm) histic horizon or mixed with mineral soil in Northern Germany (soil organic carbon concentration (C-org)from 9 to 52%).
   The net GHG balance, corrected for carbon export by harvest, was around 4 t CO2-C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) on soils with peat layer and little drainage (mean annual water table < 20 cm below surface). The net GHG balance reached 7- 9 t CO2-C-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) on soils with sand mixed into the peat layer and water tables between 14 cm and 39 cm below surface. GHG emissions from drained histic Gleysols (i)wereas high as those from deep Histosols, (ii) increase linearly from shallow to deeper drainage, (iii) but are not affected by C-org content of the histic horizon. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was linearly correlated with water table level even if it was below the histic horizon. The R-eco/GPP ratio was 1.5 at all sites, so that we ruled out a major influence of the inter-site variability in vegetation composition on annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE).
   The IPCC definition of organic soils includes shallow histic topsoil, unlike most national and international definitions of Histosols. Our study confirms that this broader definition is appropriate considering anthropogenic GHG emissions from drained organic soils. Countries currently apply soil maps in national GHG inventories which are likely not to include histic Gleysols. The land area with GHG emission hotspots due to drainage is likely to be much higher than anticipated.
   Deeply drained histic Gleysols are GHG hotspots that have so far been neglected or underestimated. Peat mixing with sand does not mitigate GHG emissions. Our study implies that rewetting organic soils, including histic Gleysols, has a much higher relevance for GHG mitigation strategies than currently recognized.

AB The botanical composition and structure of wetland vegetation from seven sites in the alpine and subalpine tracts of the Bogong High Plains was sampled in 1995 and 1996. Sites were in the vicinity of. Mts Nelse, Cope and Fainter. Sampling was based on contiguous 1-m(2) quadrats along transects 20-70 m long across each wetland. Samples were ordinated using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Floristic variation was assessed both within selected individual wetlands, and between wetlands from different regions. The relationship between the ordinations and environmental variables such as soil surface texture, soil depth and the amount of bare ground was tested by fitting vectors. Three dominant vegetation assemblages were identified. Closed heath, of hygrophyllous, scleromorphic shrubs such as Richea continentis and Baeckea gunniana, the rush Empodisma minus and the moss Sphagnum cristarum occurred on the deeper peats. Low open heath of Epacris glacialis and Danthonia nivicola occurred on shallow peats. Herbfields of Caltha introloba and Oreobolus pumilio occurred on stony pavements in two different physiographic situations-on relatively steep slopes (10-20 degrees) at the head of wetlands, and on flat ground (slope < 2 degrees), below the head of wetlands. The pavements on the steeper sites appeared to be associated with periglacial features such as solifluction lobes and terraces. Those on the flatter ground appeared to have been derived more recently. Wetlands in the Mt Cope region consisted of closed heath, low open heath and pavement herbfield in various proportions. Wetlands on Mt Fainter, which are subject to heavy trampling by cattle, were in a degraded condition, with a low cover of major hygrophyllous mosses and shrubs, and a high cover of introduced species. Long-ungrazed wetlands in a 50-year exclosure at Rocky Valley had high cover of closed heath, no pavements, numerous ponds and virtually no entrenched drainage channels or exposed peat. The Caltha herbfields are significant features nationally, both floristically and geomorphologically. Alpine and subalpine wetlands have been listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988, and continued grazing by cattle is not compatible with the conservation objectives for this alpine vegetation type.

AB Organic soils drained for crop production or grazing land are agroecosystems with potentially high but variable emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). The present study investigated the regulation of N2O emissions in a raised bog area drained for agriculture, which is classified as potentially acid sulfate soil. We hypothesised that pyrite (FeS2) oxidation was a potential driver of N2O emissions through microbially mediated reduction of nitrate (NO3-). Two sites with rotational grass, and two sites with a potato crop, were equipped for monitoring of N2O emissions and soil N2O concentrations at the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm depth during weekly field campaigns in spring and autumn 2015. Further data acquisition included temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, water table (WT) depth, and soil NO3- and ammonium (NH4+) concentrations. At all sites, the soil was acidic, with pH ranging from 4.7 to 5.4. Spring and autumn monitoring periods together represented between 152 and 174 d, with cumulative emissions of 4-5 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) at sites with rotational grass and 20-50 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) at sites with a potato crop. Equivalent soil gas-phase concentrations of N2O at grassland sites varied between 0 and 25 mu L L-1 except for a sampling after slurry application at one of the sites in spring, with a maximum of 560 mu L L-1 at the 1 m depth. At the two potato sites the levels of below-ground N2O concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 2270 mu L L-1 and from 0.1 to 470 mu L L-1, in accordance with the higher soil mineral N availability at arable sites. Statistical analyses using graphical models showed that soil N2O concentration in the capillary fringe (i.e. the soil volume above the water table influenced by tension saturation) was the strongest predictor of N2O emissions in spring and, for grassland sites, also in the autumn. For potato sites in autumn, there was evidence that NO3- availability in the topsoil and temperature were the main controls on N2O emissions. Chemical analyses of intact soil cores from the 0 to 1m depth, collected at adjacent grassland and potato sites, showed that the total reduction capacity of the peat soil (assessed by cerium(IV) reduction) was much higher than that represented by FeS2, and the concentrations of total reactive iron (TRFe) were higher than those of FeS2. Based on the statistical graphical models and the tentative estimates of reduction capacities, FeS2 oxidation was unlikely to be important for N2O emissions. Instead, archaeal ammonia oxidation and either chemodenitrification or nitrifier denitrification were considered to be plausible pathways of N2O production in spring, whereas in the autumn heterotrophic denitrification may have been more important at arable sites.

AB The accuracy of Arctic lake chronologies has been assessed by measuring the C-14 activities of modern carbon sources and applying these isotopic mass balances to dating fossil lake materials. Small (<1 km(2)) shallow (<25 m) Arctic lakes with watersheds <12 km(2) have soil and peat stratigraphic sections with C-14 activities ranging from 98 to 51% Modern. The C-14 activity of particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved inorganic carbon from lake and stream waters ranges from 121 to 95% Modern, The sediment-water interface of the studied lakes shows consistent C-14 ages of similar to 1000 C-14 yr, although the C-14 activity of living aquatic vegetation is 115% Modern. Radiocarbon measurements of components of the lacustrine carbon pool imply that the similar to 1000 C-14 yr age of the sediment-water interface results from deposition of C-14-depleted organic matter derived from the water-shed.

TI QUANTIFYING ANTHROPOGENIC NUTRIENT SOURCES AND LOADINGS WITHIN A SMALL
   CATCHMENT WITH CONSERVATION INTERESTS, EASTERN SCOTLAND
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
LA English
DT Review
AB 1.  This paper demonstrates the possibility of quantifying sub-catchment nutrient budgets from routinely monitored hydrological and hydrochemical data.  The relative importance of a number of potential anthropogenic nutrient sources was quantified for a small catchment in Scotland.  Within the catchment there are two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, including two lochs and a floodplain mire.  The study was undertaken to provide information for prescribing strategies to safeguard the conservation interests of these aquatic systems.
   2.  The principal source of nitrate was found to be groundwater.  Phosphate and ammonium loadings were greatest in surface run-off.  The evidence indicates that the greatest contributor towards these nutrient sources is agriculture.  Even when conservative estimates of losses were applied, current fertilizer and animal inputs could account for present day nutrient loadings.  In addition, changes in the area under arable farming and under individual crops during the past 30 years are consistent with trends in nitrate and phosphate loads.
   3.  Nutrient inputs from sewage works overflows and septic tanks within the catchment were estimated to be small.  Leachate from a landfill site within the catchment was also not considered to be a major source of nutrients, but a more intensive water quality monitoring programme would be needed to confirm the absence of leachate plumes.
   4.  The only long-term solution to reducing nutrient loadings to the aquatic systems is a reduction in agricultural activities within the catchment and avoidance of fertilizer and slurry applications near water sources.  Diversion of drainage ditch waters supplying the floodplain mire is also a possibility but the hydrological consequences of such an action could induce more severe degradation than that due to nutrient enrichment.

AB We found a consistent distribution pattern for radiocarbon in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and methane replicated across spatial and temporal scales in northern peatlands from Minnesota to Alaska. The C-14 content of DOC is relatively modern throughout the peat column, to depths of 3 m. In sedge-dominated peatlands, the C-14 contents of the products of respiration, CH4 and DIC, are essentially the same and are similar to that of DOC. In Sphagnum- and woody plant-dominated peatlands with few sedges, however, the respiration products are similar but intermediate between the C-14 contents of the solid phase peat and the DOC. Preliminary data indicates qualitative differences in the pore water DOC, depending on the extent of sedge cover, consistent with the hypothesis that the DOC in sedge-dominated peatlands is more reactive than DOC in peatlands where Sphagnum or other vascular plants dominate. These data are supported by molecular level analysis of DOC by ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry that suggests more dramatic changes with depth in the composition of DOC in the sedge-dominated peatland pore waters relative to changes observed in DOC where Sphagnum dominates. The higher reactivity of DOC from sedge-dominated peatlands may be a function of either different source materials or environmental factors that are related to the abundance of sedges in peatlands.

AB The purpose of this study is to describe the history of sediment deposition that has been occurring for several decades along the margins of the Kushiro Mire, into which the Kuchoro River drains. The dendrogeomorphic technique was used to examine an even-aged forest and adventitious roots to assess short-term (20 years) deposition rates and the frequency of heavy rainfall events. For medium- (40 years) and long-term (100 years) deposition rates, radiochronotogical analyses using Cs-137 and Pb-210 were also conducted. Several instances of high deposition rates caused by flooding events during the last 20 years were identified from the analysis of adventitious roots. The average sedimentation rate from 1963 to the present, estimated from the Cs-137 study, is over 1.3 cm/year. Using the Pb-210 dating method, based on a CFCS model which considered the organic matter content appropriate to wetland sediment, three deposition rates in the last 60 years were estimated: 2.0 cm/year from 1981 to 2000, 8.9 cm/year from 1975 to 1981, and 0.14 cm/year from 1939 to 1975. The analysis of environmental radionuclides indicated that the greatest sedimentation rates occurred in the years 1975 to 1981, when the Kuchoro River was extensively channelized and flood and/or precipitation events occurred. This suggests that land-use development and channelization introduced a large amount of sediment into the marginal areas of wetland through the drainage system and this was deposited on top of the peat soil.

AB Permafrost stores globally significant amounts of carbon (C) which may start to decompose and be released to the atmosphere in form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) as global warming promotes extensive thaw. This permafrost carbon feedback to climate is currently considered to be the most important carbon-cycle feedback missing from climate models. Predicting the magnitude of the feedback requires a better understanding of how differences in environmental conditions post-thaw, particularly hydrological conditions, control the rate at which C is released to the atmosphere. In the sporadic and discontinuous permafrost regions of north-west Canada, we measured the rates and sources of C released from relatively undisturbed ecosystems, and compared these with forests experiencing thaw following wildfire (well-drained, oxic conditions) and collapsing peat plateau sites (water-logged, anoxic conditions). Using radiocarbon analyses, we detected substantial contributions of deep soil layers and/or previously-frozen sources in our well-drained sites. In contrast, no loss of previously-frozen C as CO2 was detected on average from collapsed peat plateaus regardless of time since thaw and despite the much larger stores of available C that were exposed. Furthermore, greater rates of new peat formation resulted in these soils becoming stronger C sinks and this greater rate of uptake appeared to compensate for a large proportion of the increase in CH4 emissions from the collapse wetlands. We conclude that in the ecosystems we studied, changes in soil moisture and oxygen availability may be even more important than previously predicted in determining the effect of permafrost thaw on ecosystem C balance and, thus, it is essential to monitor, and simulate accurately, regional changes in surface wetness.

AB The terrestrial-aquatic interface is a crucial environment in which to consider the fate of exported terrestrial carbon in the aquatic system. Here the fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may be controlled by nutrient availability. However, peat-dominated headwater catchments are normally of low nutrient status and thus there is little data on how DOC and nutrient export co-varies. We present nutrient and DOC data for two UK catchments dominated by peat headwaters. One, Whitelee, is undergoing development for Europe's largest windfarm. Glen Dye by comparison is relatively undisturbed. At both sites there are significant linear relationships between DOC and soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate concentrations in the drainage waters. However, inter-catchment differences exist. Changes in the pattern of nutrient and carbon export at Whitelee reveal that landscape disturbance associated with windfarm development impacts the receiving waters, and that nutrient export does not increase in a stoichiometric manner that will promote increase in microbial biomass but rather supports aquatic respiration. In turn greater CO2 efflux may prevail. Hence disturbance of terrestrial carbon stores may impact the both the aquatic and gaseous carbon cycle. We suggest estimates of aquatic carbon export should inform the decision-making process prior to development in ecosystems and catchments with high terrestrial carbon storage.

AB Decomposition of organic substances is one of the main processes responsible for the signatures of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in soils and peats. However, the applicability of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures at the natural abundance level as indicators of the degree of peat decomposition is still debatable. We evaluated delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth patterns of peat cores sampled at nine sites in two nearby Alpine peat bogs with varying degree of organic matter degradation. Based on water table depths and past drainage intensities, the peat cores were divided into three degradation classes. We found similar overall depths patterns of delta C-13 and delta N-15 across the nine depth profiles and distinct differences between aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. Considerable differences in stable C and N isotope signatures of same depths were detected between profiles of the three classes, whereas depth profiles of peat cores with similar degree in peatland degradation were nearly identical. In the aerobic peat layers, delta C-13 and delta N-15 increased with depths at all study sites from 2.6 parts per thousand to 4.9 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 3.2 parts per thousand to 7.0 parts per thousand for delta N-15 compared to the initial signatures of the plant biomass. Standardised delta C-13 of aerobic layers differ distinctly between slightly degraded pests at the open peat bog area, intermediately degraded peats at the tree-covered edge areas and strongly degraded pests at the former peat-cutting site. delta C-13 signatures of aerobic layers of strongly degraded pests were markedly more negative compared to the slightly degraded peats because of the selective C-12 losses by microbial respiration. delta N-15 were more positive at strongly degraded than at slightly degraded sites in both, aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. The uniform stable isotope ratios in the anaerobic layers deeper than the local maxima of the isotopic signatures support the assumption that minor C-13 fractionation occurs under anaerobic conditions. delta C-13 slightly declining with depth in the waterlogged layers of strongly degraded peat reflects the preferential utilisation and loss of labile organic compounds enriched in C-13. delta N-15 of strongly degraded pests was higher compared to well-conserved peat The close relationship between the measured delta N-15 to delta N-15 modelled based on C:N ratios and bulk densities supports the assumption that the delta N-15 signature is the result of isotopic fractionation by peat decomposition. We conclude that peat decomposition strongly affects the delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth profiles of peat bogs and most likely overrides other factors, such as differences between plant species, litter components, atmospheric delta C-13 shift during peat formation, temperature effects, or type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems in northern high latitudes exchange large amounts of methane (CH4) with the atmosphere. Climate warming could have a great impact on CH4 exchange, in particular in regions where degradation of permafrost is induced. In order to improve the understanding of the present and future methane dynamics in permafrost regions, we studied CH4 fluxes of typical landscape structures in a small catchment in the forest tundra ecotone in northern Siberia. Gas fluxes were measured using a closed-chamber technique from August to November 2003 and from August 2006 to July 2007 on tree-covered mineral soils with and without permafrost, on a frozen bog plateau, and on a thermokarst pond. For areal integration of the CH4 fluxes, we combined field observations and classification of functional landscape structures based on a high-resolution Quickbird satellite image. All mineral soils were net sinks of atmospheric CH4. The magnitude of annual CH4 uptake was higher for soils without permafrost (1.19 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)) than for soils with permafrost (0.37 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)). In well-drained soils, significant CH4 uptake occurred even after the onset of ground frost. Bog plateaux, which stored large amounts of frozen organic carbon, were also a net sink of atmospheric CH4 (0.38 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)). Thermokarst ponds, which developed from permafrost collapse in bog plateaux, were hot spots of CH4 emission (approximately 200 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)). Despite the low area coverage of thermokarst ponds (only 2.1% of the total catchment area), emissions from these sites resulted in a mean catchment CH4 emission of 3.8 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1). Export of dissolved CH4 with stream water was insignificant. The results suggest that mineral soils and bog plateaux in this region will respond differently to increasing temperatures and associated permafrost degradation. Net uptake of atmospheric CH4 in mineral soils is expected to gradually increase with increasing active layer depth and soil drainage. Changes in bog plateaux will probably be much more rapid and drastic. Permafrost collapse in frozen bog plateaux would result in high CH4 emissions that act as positive feedback to climate warming.

AB Wetlands and organic soils have been recognized as important sinks for arsenic in the environment, yet sources and immobilization mechanisms of As are often unclear. To begin rectifying this deficiency, we investigated As retention and binding mechanisms at a degraded, minerotrophic wetland site in contact with groundwater rich in As and Fe. Arsenic occurred in high dissolved concentrations of up to 467 p g L-1 in the groundwater, but dropped to values below 10 mu g L-1 towards the surface. The solid phase As content instead was high in the topsoil with up to 3400 mg kg(-1) and decreased with depth to 15 mg kg(-1). A similar pattern was observed with respect to Fe. Amorphous and crystalline iron precipitates were the main sorbents for arsenic in the soil horizons according to results from wet chemical sequential extractions. Arsenic was apparently not associated with inorganic carbon phases, but a substantial portion of up to 31% of As-tot could be mobilized by dispersion of soil organic matter. Ratios of dissolved As(III)/As(V) decreased from the deeper As(III) dominated groundwater to the As(V) dominated soil porewaters, where As was apparently immobilized in its oxidized form. Concentrations of the organic species DMA and MMA were negligible. According to the results of simple one-dimensional estimates the vertical arsenic transport from the source in the groundwater to the topsoil was slow given an extrapolation of current conditions. These results suggest that As accumulation started before the beginning of drainage in the now degraded peatland soils and the degradation and mass loss of organic matter under oxic conditions caused the very high As concentrations found in the topsoil horizon today.

AB The humid tropical insular Southeast Asian region is one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world. It contains around 70Gt of carbon stored in peat deposits susceptible to burning when drained and it has significantly higher population density than any other humid tropical region. This region experiences yearly fire activity of anthropogenic origin with widely varying extent and severity. At the same time, there are several geographic, climatic, and social aspects that complicate fire monitoring in the region. In this review article, we analyse the current knowledge and limitations of active fire detection and burnt area mapping in insular Southeast Asia, highlighting the special characteristics of the region that affect all types of remote-sensing-based regional-level fire monitoring. We conclude that the monitoring methods currently employed have serious limitations that directly affect the reliability of results for fire and burnt area monitoring in this region. With the materials and methods presently available, the regional and global effects of fire activity taking place in insular Southeast Asia are in danger of being underestimated. New approaches utilizing higher spatial and temporal resolution remote-sensing data are needed for more detailed quantification of fire activity and subsequently improved estimation of the effects of fires in this region.

AB The impact of experimentally intensified summer drought and precipitation on N2O and NO turnover and fluxes was investigated in a minerotrophic fen over a 2-year period. On three treatment plots, drought was induced for 6 and 10 weeks by means of roofs and drainage and decreased water table levels by 0.1-0.3 m compared with three nonmanipulated control plots. When averaged over the three treatment plots, both N2O and NO emission showed only little response to the drought. On the single plot scale, however, a clear impact of the treatment on N2O and NO fluxes could be identified. On the plot with the weakest water table reduction hardly any response could be observed, while on the plot with the greatest drainage effect, N2O and NO fluxes increased by 530% and 270%, respectively. Rewetting reduced NO emissions to background levels (0.05-0.15 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)), but heavily enhanced N2O emission (18-36 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) for several days in the plots with largest water table reduction. These peaks contributed up to 40% to the cumulative N2O fluxes and were caused by rapid N2O production according to isotope abundance data. According to N2O concentrations and isotope abundance analysis N2O was mostly produced at depths between 0.3 and 0.5 m. During water table reduction net N2O production in 0.1 m depth steadily increased in the most effectively dried plot from 2 up to 44 pmol cm(-3) day(-1). Rewetting immediately increased net N2O production in the topsoil of the drought plots, showing rates of 18-174 pmol cm(-3) day(-1). This study demonstrates that drought and rewetting can temporarily increase N2O emission to levels that have to date only been reported from nutrient rich and degraded fens that have been drained for agricultural purposes.

AB Boreal peatlands are major sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to downstream aquatic ecosystems, where it influences carbon cycling and food web structure. Wildfire and permafrost thaw alter peatland vegetation and hydrology and may affect the quantity and chemical composition of exported DOC. We studied the influence of wildfire and thaw on microbial and photochemical lability of near-surface porewater DOC, assessed through 7 d incubations. We carried out these incubations in spring, summer, and fall but only found differences in spring when DOC biodegradability (% loss during dark incubations) increased with lower DOC aromaticity and C/N ratios. During spring, the most labile DOC was found in recently formed thermokarst bogs along collapsing peat plateau edges (25% loss), which was greater than in mature sections of thermokarst bogs (3%), and peat plateaus with intact permafrost (9%). Increased DOC lability following thaw was likely linked to high DOC production and turnover associated with productive hydrophilic Sphagnum mosses and sedges, rather than thawed permafrost peat. A wildfire (3 yr prior) reduced DOC biodegradability in both peat plateaus (4%) and rapidly collapsing peat plateau edges (14%). Biodegradability of DOC in summer and fall was low across all sites; 2% and 4%, respectively. Photodegradation was shown to potentially contribute significantly to downstream DOC degradation but did not vary across peatland sites. We show that disturbances such as permafrost thaw and wildfire have the potential to affect downstream carbon cycling, particularly as the largest influences were found in spring when peatlands are well connected to downstream aquatic ecosystems.

AB We estimate the nitrogen retention capacity of natural wetlands in the 1.7 million km(2)Baltic Sea drainage basin, using a wetland GIS data base. There are approximately 138,000 km(2)of wetlands (bogs and fens) in the Baltic Sea drainage basin, corresponding to 8% of the area. The input of nitrogen to natural wetlands from atmospheric deposition was estimated to 55,000-161,000 ton y(-1) A map of the deposition of both wet and dry nitrogen is presented. The input from the human population was estimated to 255,000 ton y(-1) in terms of excretory release in processed sewage water. There may also be leakage from forests and agricultural land into the wetlands. Due to lack of data on hydrology and topography, such potential nitrogen sources are not accounted for here. The capacity of the wetlands to retain the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen was estimated to 34,000-99,000 ton y(-1) The potential retention by wetlands was estimated to 57,000-145,000 ton y(-1) when the nitrogen input from the human population was added. If drained wetlands were to be restored and their area added to the present wetland area, the nitrogen retention capacity was estimated to increase to 196,000-261,000 ton y(-1). Our results indicate that existing natural wetlands in the Baltic Sea drainage basin annually can retain an amount of nitrogen which corresponds to about 5-13% of annual total (natural and anthropogenic) nitrogen emissions entering the Baltic Sea. The ecosystem retention service performed by wetlands accounts for a substantial nitrogen removal, thereby reducing the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea.

AB The diversity and endemism of Australian Tanypodinae (Diptera: Chironomidae) has been unclear from morphological comparisons with well-grounded northern hemisphere taxonomy. As part of a comprehensive study, here we focus on one of the few described endemic genera, Yarrhpelopia Cranston. Extensive and intensive new sampling and newly-acquired molecular data provides clarity for the type species, Yarrhpelopia norrisi Cranston and allows recognition of congeners and potential sister group(s). We describe Yarrhpelopia acorona Cranston & Krosch sp. n., and we recognise a third species from Western Australia, retaining an informal code 'V20' due to inadequate reared / associated material for formal description. We recognise a robust clade Coronapelopia Cranston & Krosch gen. n., treated as a genus new to science for two new species, Coronapelopia valedon Cranston & Krosch sp. n. and Coronapelopia quadridentata Cranston & Krosch sp. n., from eastern Australia, each described in their larval and pupal stages and partial imaginal stages. Interleaved between the independent new Australian clades Yarrhpelopia and Coronapelopia are New World Pentaneura and relatives, that allow a tentative inference of a dated gondwanan (austral) connection. Expanded sampling indicates that Y. norrisi, although near predictably present in mine-polluted waters, is not obligate but generally indicates acidic waters, including natural swamps and Sphagnum bogs. The inferred acidophily, including in drainages of mine adits, applies to many taxa under consideration here.

AB Bulk density, total contents of N, P, K, Ca and Fe and field- and laboratory-incubated mineral-N were determined for a bog and fen site 3 years after drainage treatments (3 m and 15 m ditch spacings), tilling treatments (untilled, tilled) and fertilization treatments (unfertilized, PK-fertilized), as well as for adjacent untreated (undisturbed) areas of the bog and fen, Tilling of the surface or fertilization did not significantly affect total nutrient contents in either bog or fen, although nutrient contents were generally higher in fertilization or drainage treatments that included tilling, As a result of decreased ditch spacing (from 15 m to 3 m), bulk density was significantly increased in the bog site (from 44.9 to 63.5 mg cm(-3)) and decreased (non-significant) in the fen site (from 105 to 89 mg cm(-3)). Total P and K were increased where PK was applied as fertilizer. In bog peats, bulk density (mg cm(-3)), total N concentrations (mg g(-1)) and total contents (kg ha(-1)) of N, P, K, Ca and Fe were significantly higher in the 3 m ditch spacing than in the 15 m ditch spacing. Thus, increases in total nutrient contents in bog peats can be attributed mainly to increased bulk density as a result of drainage treatment. in contrast, bulk densities and most nutrient contents of fen peats were not significantly affected by treatments. However, total N concentrations and total N contents were significantly reduced by more intensive ditching (3 m ditch spacing). Contents of mineral N in fresh pear and field-incubated and laboratory anaerobically incubated (30 degrees C) peat consisted entirely of NH4-N. Laboratory incubations over a 20-week period demonstrated a high potential for release of NH4-N in peat from treated sites of bog and fen. During four 28-day field incubation periods, production of mineral-N varied from 0.1 to 1.2 kg ha(-1) (net mineralization) to -0.1 to -0.3 kg ha(-1) (net immobilization) for bog peat. Similarly, on the fen site production ranged from 0.1 to 2.7 kg ha(-1) (net mineralization) and -0.1 to -1.7 kg ha(-1) (net immobilization). In the unfertilized and PK-fertilized treatments of the fen, as well as the PK-fertilized treatment of the bog, net immobilization predominated during the first incubation period, followed by net mineralization during the next three incubation periods.

AB Peatlands represent globally significant soil carbon stores that have been accumulating for millennia under water-logged conditions. However, deepening water-table depths (WTD) from climate change or human-induced drainage could stimulate decomposition resulting in peatlands turning from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Contemporary WTD ranges of testate amoebae (TA) are commonly used to predict past WTD in peatlands using quantitative transfer function models. Here we present, for the first time, a study comparing TA-based WTD reconstructions to instrumentally monitored WTD and hydrological model predictions using the MILLENNIA peatland model to examine past peatland responses to climate change and land management. Although there was very good agreement between monitored and modeled WTD, TA-reconstructed water table was consistently deeper. Predictions from a larger European TA transfer function data set were wetter, but the overall directional fit to observed WTD was better for a TA transfer function based on data from northern England. We applied a regression-based offset correction to the reconstructed WTD for the validation period (1931-2010). We then predicted WTD using available climate records as MILLENNIA model input and compared the offset-corrected TA reconstruction to MILLENNIA WTD predictions over an extended period (1750-1931) with available climate reconstructions. Although the comparison revealed striking similarities in predicted overall WTD patterns, particularly for a recent drier period (1965-1995), there were clear periods when TA-based WTD predictions underestimated (i.e. drier during 1830-1930) and overestimated (i.e. wetter during 1760-1830) past WTD compared to MILLENNIA model predictions. Importantly, simulated grouse moor management scenarios may explain the drier TA WTD predictions, resulting in considerable model predicted carbon losses and reduced methane emissions, mainly due to drainage. This study demonstrates the value of a site-specific and combined data-model validation step toward using TA-derived moisture conditions to understand past climate-driven peatland development and carbon budgets alongside modeling likely management impacts.

AB The rate of oxidation of peat soils is highly seasonal and varies with temperature and soil moisture content. Large variations in soil moisture content result in wet-dry cycles that can enhance peat degradation. Water-table management plays a crucial role in controlling and damping the effect of these environmental factors. However, maintaining high ditch water levels in fields bounded by ditches does not guarantee a high field groundwater level. The effect of installing subsurface irrigation at different spacings on water table elevation was studied in a low-lying peat grassland. The water table elevation data were compared against values predicted with a water balance model. In addition, greenhouse experiments were carried out on undisturbed soil core samples collected from the peat grassland as well as a low-lying peatland under intensive arable faming to measure CO2 evolution under different water regimes. The field data from the peat grassland suggest that sub-irrigation spacing as low as 10 m is necessary during summer periods to maintain groundwater levels similar to those in the ditches. Over the same period of observation, the difference in water level between the ditches and the non-irrigated fields is as high as 0.7 m. Modelled outputs are in good correlation with the field observations, and demonstrate that simple water balance models can provide an effective tool to study the effect of water management practices and potential changes in subsurface conditions, climate and land use on water-table levels. The measurement of CO2 emission from undisturbed peat soil columns shows that the rate of oxidation of soil organic matter from peat soils is highly seasonal and that drainage exacerbates the rate of peat mineralization.

AB This study investigates the growth of forest stands (m(3)ha(-1)a(-1)) and its temporal variation during the five decades of the period 1961-2010 as measured in the national forest inventories by the Finnish Forest Research Institute, in three regions, comprising the southern half of Finland. This growth was explained by sum of the effective temperatures and winter maximum soil frost depth; the correlation coefficient between the measured and modelled growths for the regions and decades studied being 0.97. It was also shown that the regional differences in soil frost depth are related to the differences between the temperature sum in the air and that in the upper soil layer during the growing season. Further, the residuals of the main test were analyzed for secondary factors. The temporal and regional variation could be accounted for by the relatively low growth in the peatland-forests created by the extensive drainage measures of 1961 1980, the response of the growth-rate to May+June precipitation, and the extensive application of fertilizers in 1968 1980. The regional differences and temporal changes in climate are also reflected in the understorey vegetation.

AB In coastal North Norway, mire areas and mire pools frequently exist, but their development and time of origin are poorly known. In order to investigate the development of a coastal mire pool and relate its changes to known climatic changes, a sediment sequence from the mire-pool Lillevardhaugvatnet (c. 0.05 ha large), was C-14-dated, investigated for loss on ignition and analysed for pollen and botanical macrofossils.
   The bottom of the sequence dates c. 7500 cal. BP. The site gradually developed from a swamp forest c. 6200 cal. BP via a more open dwarf-shrub phase to a pool c. 5000 cal. BP. The pool grew in depth as the result of continuous peat growth damming the water body. The water level of the pool was probably lowered by erosional drain c. 2700 cal. BP. Redeposited peat in the sequence occurred c. 2100 cal. BP and c. 1100 cal. BP. C-14-dates and pollen indicate that erosion and redeposition of the peat surrounding the mire pool is a normal process, connected with the expansion of the water body.
   The combination of macrofossils and pollen accumulation rates (PAR) of R sylvestris indicates that in small lakes in coastal areas of North Norway, a PAR of 200-400 cm(-2) yr(-1) is sufficient for indicating local presence of P. sylvestris. P sylvestris is represented with abundant macrofossils between 4800 and 2100 cal. BR It is suggested that a marked R sylvestris decrease about 2100 cal. BP may be a combined effect of human impact and climatic deterioration. A possible final termination of the R sylvestris population about 1600 cal. BP may be considered human-made.

AB Euglena mutabilis is a photosynthetic protist found in acidic aquatic environments such as peat bogs, volcanic lakes and acid mine drainages (AMDs). Through its photosynthetic metabolism, this protist is supposed to have an important role in primary production in such oligotrophic ecosystems. Nevertheless, the exact contribution of E. mutabilis in organic matter synthesis remains unclear and no evidence of metabolite secretion by this protist has been established so far. Here we combined in situ proteo-metabolomic approaches to determine the nature of the metabolites accumulated by this protist or potentially secreted into an AMD. Our results revealed that the secreted metabolites are represented by a large number of amino acids, polyamine compounds, urea and some sugars but no fatty acids, suggesting a selective organic matter contribution in this ecosystem. Such a production may have a crucial impact on the bacterial community present on the study site, as it has been suggested previously that prokaryotes transport and recycle in situ most of the metabolites secreted by E. mutabilis. Consequently, this protist may have an indirect but important role in AMD ecosystems but also in other ecological niches often described as nitrogen-limited.

AB We estimated the magnitude of the radiative forcing (RF) due to changes in albedo following the forestation of peatlands, and calculated the net RF by taking into account the changes in both the albedo and the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes during one forest rotation. Data on radiation, tree biomass, and soil GHG fluxes were combined with models for canopy cover, tree carbon accumulation, and the RF due to increased atmospheric GHG concentrations for four typical site cases in Finland covering two soil nutrient levels in the south and north of the country. We also studied the observed long-term surface temperatures to detect any indications of drainage-induced effects. The magnitude of the albedo-induced RF was similar to that caused by the carbon sequestration of the growing trees. At three site cases out of four the drainage induced a cooling or negative RF, the tendency for cooling being higher at sites with a higher nutrient level. The differences in albedo-induced RF mainly arose from the spring season due to (1) the different snow cover duration in the south versus the north, and (2) the different albedos of drained and undrained snow covered peatlands. An increase in the maximum daily temperatures was observed in April in southern Finland, where the most intensive drainage practices have taken place, suggesting that forestry drainage has potentially affected the local climate. Our results show that the decreasing albedo resulting from peatland forestation contributes significantly to the RF, balancing out or even exceeding the cooling effect due to the changing GHG fluxes.

AB Buffer zones can be used to reduce nutrient and suspended sediment export following forest clearfelling by directing runoff over a vegetated area. This study demonstrates the achievability of constructing a buffer zone by initially clearfelling the standing forest, seeding with two native grass species and directing the water from a semi-natural stream draining an upstream 10 ha forested peatland site through it. Following the clearfelling of the upstream study site this study tested the efficacy of this management practice in reducing nutrient and suspended sediment concentration in the receiving water. The buffer zone reduced total reactive phosphorus (TRP) and suspended sediment (SS) loads by 18% and 33%, respectively. Phosphorus (P) retention efficiency was dependent on inlet concentrations, loading and hydraulic loading rates. In storm events with a loading rate of >28 g P ha(-1), a flow rate higher than 88.5 L s(-1) and an inlet concentration of <17 mu g L-1 the buffer zone became a TRP release source. The maximum P concentration in the buffer zone did not exceed 40 mu g L-1 during this study demonstrating that the buffer zone method could be used efficiently in peatland forestry to moderate the high P concentrations and assist in protecting salmonids and freshwater pearl mussels.

TI Common Reed for Thatching in Northern Germany: Estimating the Market

AB Reed has a long tradition as locally available thatching material, but nowadays thatch is a globally traded commodity. Germany and other major importing countries such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Denmark rely on high import rates to meet the national consumption. This study aimed at providing a detailed picture of the thatching reed market in Northern Germany and at assessing the market potential for reed of regional origin. A written survey among all thatchers in Northern Germany was carried out in 2019, arriving at an effective sample of 47 out of 141 companies. The results revealed that for the responding companies the majority of the reed (59%) was used for rethatching roofs completely, 24% for newly constructed roofs, and 17% for roof repairs. Reed from Germany held a low share of 17% of the total consumption in 2018. Own reed harvesting was conducted by less than 9% of the responding companies and given up during the last decades by another 26%. The total market volume of reed for thatching in Northern Germany was estimated for 2018 with a 95% confidence interval at 3 +/- 0.8 million bundles of reed with a monetary value at sales prices of euro11.6 +/- 2.8 million. Based on the end consumer demand, the supply gap for reed of regional or German origin was estimated at 523,000 +/- 392,000 bundles of reed equaling a market value of euro1.9 +/- 1.4 million, indicating high uncertainties. Most of the responding thatchers (70%) did not promote reed of regional origin, mainly due to insufficient availability but also a lack in quality was reported. The cultivation of reed in paludiculture, i.e., as climate-smart land use alternative to drainage-based agriculture on peatlands, can increase the availability of thatching reed in Germany and simultaneously reduce GHG emissions.

AB An intact hydrologic regime and the presence of peat forming vegetation are critical for the persistence of fen wetlands. Fen restoration projects often focus on reestablishing water tables near the soil surface, with little effort directed toward identifying, historic hydrologic regimes, hydrologic modifications, and the sources of degradation. We used inconsistencies in the modern hydrologic regime and historic hydrologic indicators present in the soil seedbank, vegetation, and organic soil composition to identify areas of Drakesbad Meadow, a mountain fen in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, that had been degraded. A network of ground-water monitoring wells and piezometers were used to identify the hydrologic regime of the 4.7-ha site. The presence of thick organic soils in sites with deep late summer water tables, inconsistencies between species present in the seedbank and the existing vegetation, and the presence of dry meadow species such as Poapratensis and Hordeum brachyantherum in areas with organic soils were used to determine that 2.4 ha of the site was degraded. A drainage ditch within the fen and diversions of the fen's water supply caused by a road outside of the fen were identified as the source of hydrologic modification and degradation. These were restored by blocking the flow of water in the main drainage ditch and by installing a series of channels to allow water to cross the road. Reconnecting flow beneath the road resulted in raising the summer water table from 80 cm below the soil surface to less than 10 cm in areas downslope of the road. The addition of five sheet-metal dams perpendicular to flow in the main drainage ditch resulted in raising the water table to within 10 to 20 cm of the soil surface in areas adjacent to and down gradient of the ditch. Before restoration, average late August water table levels across the entire site were 30 cm below the soil surface, while average post-restoration water table levels were 19 cm. below the soil surface. One year following hydrologic restoration, the percent canopy cover of species indicative of uplands and wet meadows, but not fens including Deschampsia cespitosa, Hordeum brachyantherum, and Poa pratensis decreased compared with pre-restoration years, while the cover of the peat-forming species Carex utriculata, Scirpus microcarpus, and Carex simulata increased. It is clear from our study that fens in this region will not persist under drought-like conditions created by water diversions, yet well-designed restoration projects can be used to restore modified hydrologic regimes and peat-forming vegetation necessary for the persistence of fen wetlands.

AB The transfer of carbon from terrestrial peat to the fluvial environment forms an important component of the peatland carbon cycle and has major implications for water quality Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is generally considered the largest constituent of aquatic carbon and tends to be the most intensively monitored particularly in peatland catchments However many long-term records for DOG are based on proxy studies that use water colour as a surrogate This paper tests the robustness of using spectrophotometric techniques to monitor water colour based on absorbance from a single wavelength at 400 nm as a surrogate for true DOC determination The general ability of spectrophotometric analysis to measure low DOC concentrations depends on the calibration used thus the minimum mass of DOC detectable varies considerably and in this study was found to be as high as 10 32 mg C L-1 While there is often a significant correlation between water colour and DOG it was found that the use of single or even "pooled regressions to predict DOC concentrations could result in miscalculations of more than 50% Further the water colour-DOC relationship in blanket peat pore waters was found to vary significantly between peat layers land management treatments and through time Thus studies using long-term water colour records as a proxy for long-term DOC concentrations in peatlands must be treated with a certain degree of caution especially in cases where changes may have taken place to DOC production such as those caused by land management change during the course of investigation (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved

AB The stability of northern peatland's carbon (C) store under changing climate is of major concern for the global C cycle. The aquatic export of C from boreal peatlands is recognized as both a critical pathway for the remobilization of peat C stocks as well as a major component of the net ecosystem C balance (NECB). Here, we present a full year characterization of radiocarbon content (C-14) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) exported from a boreal peatland catchment coupled with C-14 characterization of the catchment's peat profile of the same C species. The age of aquatic C in runoff varied little throughout the year and appeared to be sustained by recently fixed C from the atmosphere (<60 years), despite stream DOC, CO2, and CH4 primarily being sourced from deep peat horizons (2-4 m) near the mire's outlet. In fact, the C-14 content of DOC, CO2, and CH4 across the entire peat profile was considerably enriched with postbomb C compared with the solid peat material. Overall, our results demonstrate little to no mobilization of ancient C stocks from this boreal peatland and a relatively large resilience of the source of aquatic C export to forecasted hydroclimatic changes.

AB Finnish rivers exported annually on average 1.2 M t carbon, and total organic carbon (TOC) comprised the major share (nearly 80 %) of this export. The mean area specific carbon export was 4.5 g C m(-2) year(-1). The highest organic carbon export originated from peat dominated catchments, whereas rivers draining agricultural catchments had the highest area-specific inorganic carbon fluxes. Between 1975 and 2014 total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations rose more steadily than the respective TOC concentrations. There was an overall decrease in TOC concentrations between 1975 and the mid-1990s. Decreased point source loading contributed to this pattern, although decreases were also detected in rivers without any major pollution sources. From the mid-1990s TOC concentrations started to rise and the increase was even more pronounced than the earlier decrease. The upward trend was ubiquitous, both in time and space, and it was not possible to link the changes to any specific catchment characteristics or another single driver. Warming climate, changes in hydrology and decreases in acidic deposition were the major driving factors although their contribution varied geographically. At the same time both TOC and TIC export increased slightly, but the strong upward trends in TOC concentrations were not reflected as clearly in TOC export trends. This was because changes in water flow had a dominant influence on TOC export to the sea and any changes in concentrations were masked behind the variation in flow.

AB The Canadian Land Surface Scheme is employed in off-line tests to represent a 1200 km(2) patch of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study Northern Study Area, a heterogeneous region of boreal forest in north-central Manitoba. The soils in the region vary from rapidly draining coarse sand to poorly drained areas of peat overlying clay, including wetlands. Observed surface fluxes from four sites, a young jack pine stand, an old jack pine stand, an old black spruce stand and a FEN, are scaled by proportional weighting to represent the study area. The performance of the mosaic approach, in which the region has been represented by four distinct patches, is compared with that of the aggregated approach, in which mean surface parameters have been defined based on fractional coverage. Various soil columns are employed in the aggregated approach, in order to assess the effects of representing the heterogeneous soils of the region in a single column.
   While the conservative water use at all of the sites limits the effects of changes in the soil column on the turbulent fluxes, important effects are noted. Soil evaporation is overestimated when an organic or composite soil layer is represented at the surface, and underestimated when a sandy soil column is represented. Soil evaporation can be calibrated to match that of the mosaic method, however, the need for more robust methods of accomplishing this is acknowledged. The process of aggregating the soil column eliminates the dry sandy zones which experience periods of moisture stress. This results in periods of increased canopy conductance and an overestimation of the latent heat flux. A 2-patch mosaic, with one patch consisting of sandy soil and the other patch of organic soil over clay, allows moisture stress to occur and produces modelled half-hourly sensible and latent heat fluxes that agree more closely to those of the 4-patch mosaic than any of the aggregated runs, across the range of hydrometeorological variables. Throughout the course of the model runs presented here, the 2-patch mosaic also exhibits cumulative drainage and evapotranspiration closer to that of the 4-patch mosaic than any of the aggregated soil columns.

SO GEOMECHANICS AND ENGINEERING
LA English

ID MODEL
AB Organic soils exhibit problematic properties such as high compressibility and low shear strength; these properties may cause differential settlement or failure in structures built on such soils. Organic soil removal or stabilization are the most important methods to overcome geotechnical problems related to peat soils' engineering characteristics. This paper presents soil mechanical intervention for stabilization of peat with sand columns and focuses on a comparison between the mechanical characteristics of undisturbed peat and peat stabilized with 20%, 30% and 40% of sand on the laboratory scale. Cylindrical columns were extruded in different diameters through a nearly undisturbed peat sample in the laboratory and filled with sand. By adding sand columns to peat, higher permeability, higher shear strength and a faster consolidation was achieved. The sample with 70% peat and 30% sand displayed the most reliable compressibility properties. This can be attributed to proper drainage provided by sand columns for peat in this specific percentage. It was observed that the granular texture of sand also increased the friction angle of peat. The addition of 30% sand led to the highest shear strength among all mixtures considered. The peat samples with 40% sand were sampled with two and three sand columns and tested in direct shear and consolidation tests to evaluate the influence of the number and geometry of sand columns. Samples with three sand columns showed higher compressibility and shear strength. Following the results of this laboratory study it appears that the introduction of sand columns could be suitable for geotechnical peat stabilization in the field scale.

AB The analyses of human-environment interactions in prehistoric and medieval mining and metallurgical centres in Europe result in various assessments of the environmental impact of early metal ore mining and metallurgy. In some mining and metallurgical sites or areas, such as the prehistoric basin on the Greek island of Kythnos or the later Morvan and Mont Loz & egrave;re areas in France as well as Tjursbosj & ouml;n in Sweden, the impact was significant and lasting. In others, such as: Cors Fochno in Wales, the Falkenstein region in Austria, or the Northern Vosges Mountains in France, the environmental changes were limited and reversible.
   The results of palaeobotanical research (pollen analysis and analysis of plant macroremains) in peat cores from southern Poland enabled the Holocene vegetation transformations in one of the oldest mining regions in Central Europe to be reconstructed. They also provided new data, used to assess the impact of settlements as well as the development of metallurgy on the environment in the region and changes in bog ecosystems. The first changes in vegetation caused by human activity were observed at the boundary between the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. They are documented by pollen indicating shepherding activity and single grains of cereal pollen. The greatest intensity of change, reflected in sediment as a maximum concentration of charcoal, was recorded at the end of the Bronze Age and attributed to the Lusatian culture. The changes in the vegetation under the impact of human activity until the early Middle Ages were reversible and had a local scope. The intensification of slash and-burn agriculture was indicated as the most probable and important cause.

AB Understanding the composition of soil organic matter (SOM) is vital to our understanding of how soils form, evolve and respond to external stimuli. The shear complexity of SOM, an inseparable mixture of thousands of compounds hinders the determination of structure-function relationships required to explore these processes on a molecular level. Litter bags and soil hot water extracts (HWE) have frequently been used to study the transformation of labile SOM, however these are still too complex to examine beyond compound classes. In this work, a much simpler mixture, HWE buried green tea, was investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), as a proxy for labile SOM. Changes induced by the burial over 90 days in a grassland, woodland and two peatland sites, one damaged by drainage and one undergoing restoration by drain-blocking, were analysed. Major differences between the extracts were observed on the level of compound classes, molecular formulae and specific molecules. The causes of these differences are discussed with reference to abiotic and biotic processes. Despite the vastly different detection limits of NMR and MS, chemometric analysis of the data yielded identical separation of the samples. These findings provide a basis for the molecular level interrogation of labile SOM and C-cycling processes in soils.

AB In many peat land areas in The Netherlands target concentrations for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in surface water are exceeded. A considerable, but poorly quantified, fraction, of the N and P loading of surface water in these areas originate from the subsoil. Waterboards, responsible for the water management, are currently exploring options to improve surface water quality, whilst sustaining agricultural production. Therefore, insight into dynamics of nutrient pools in peat soils is required. The aim of this study was to measure concentration profiles (0-12 m) of the soil solution in an intensively managed grassland on peat soil and to explore the effects of a rise in surface water level on N and P loading of surface water, using budgeting approaches and two dimensional simulation modeling. The concentration profiles of N, P and Cl reflect by the presence of nutrient-rich anaerobic peat and a nearly impermeable marine clay in the subsoil. Concentrations of N, P and Cl tended to increase with depth till about 6 m and then decreased. In the top soil, inputs of N and P via fertilizers and animal manure were only partly retrieved in the soil solution, suggestion that biogeochemical processes, uptake and lateral transport processes had a dominant influence on dissolved N and P. Exploring scenario simulations showed that major drainage fluxes passed through the peat layer that transported nutrients to adjacent surface water. Raising surface water levels with 20 cm suppresses this kind of nutrient loading of surface water by more than 30%, but nutrient rich peat layers will remain persistent as a potential source of nutrients in surface water in many peat polders in the western part of The Netherlands.

AB Surface soils and periphyton communities were sampled across an oligotrophic, soft-water wetland to document changes associated with pulsed inputs of nutrient- and mineral-rich canal drainage waters. A gradient of canal-water influence was indicated by the surface-water specific conductance, which ranged between 743 and 963 mu S cm(-1) in the canals to as low as 60 mu S cm(-1) in the rainfall-driven wetland interior. Changes in soil chemistry and periphyton taxonomic composition across this gradient were described using piecewise regressions models. The greatest increase in soil phosphorus (P) concentration occurred at sites closest to the canal while soil mineral (sulfur, calcium) concentrations increased most rapidly at the lower end of the gradient. Multiple periphyton shifts occurred at the lower end of the gradient and included; (1) a decline in desmids and non-desmid filamentous chlorophytes, and their replacement by a diatom-dominated community; (2) the loss of soft-water diatom indicator species and their replacement by hard-water species. Increased dominance by cyanobacteria and eutrophic diatom indicators occurred closer to the canals. Soil and periphyton changes indicated four zones of increasing canal influence across the wetland: (1) a zone of increasing mineral concentrations where soft-water taxa remained dominant; (2) a transition towards hard-water, oligotrophic diatoms as mineral concentrations increased further; (3) a zone of dominance by these hard-water species; (4) a zone of rapidly increasing P concentrations and dominance by eutrophic taxa. In contrast to conclusions drawn from routine water-chemistry monitoring, measures of chemical and biological change presented here indicate that most of this rainfall-driven peatland receives some influence from canal discharges. These changes are multifaceted and induced by shifts in multiple chemical constituents.

AB 1. The breeding success of Finnish grouse has been in decline for decades. While it has been shown that fragmentation and modern forestry practices such as clear-cutting affect the viability of grouse populations, little is known about effects of large-scale drainage. The drainage network in Finland has increased dramatically during the past decades. By 1988, 6 million ha of bog ecosystems had been drained. This is likely to have had a profound direct and indirect effects on grouse productivity. Because ditches persist in time, large-scale drainage may therefore have strong potential for affecting the long-term breeding success of three forest grouse species in Finland.
   2. Using a mixed-model approach on nation-wide data, we estimate the effects of drainage on breeding success of three grouse species for the period from 1966 to 1988. The possible additive effect of precipitation is investigated using regional precipitation data. For each species, we compare a set of hypotheses and select the best model(s) according to the Akaike information criterion.
   3. For all species, the model which included the main effects of both ditch density and precipitation outperformed the models with just one of the main effects as well as the interaction model. The effects are restricted to southern and central Finland, where drainage is most intensive.
   4. The effects of drainage are likely to be both direct and indirect, but the mechanisms are less clear. Both bottom-up, such as decreased availability of insect food, and top-down effects, such as increased predation risk, may account for indirect effects. Direct effects are likely to involve drowning of chicks.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Bogs are classified as key biotopes by the European Union, and Finland is obliged to maintain their favourable conservation status and to protect typical bog communities. While this goal may be achieved for state-owned land, restoration of drainage systems on private land continues. Considering the persistence of ditches, new legislation are therefore needed to favour the recovery of former bogs and mires on private land as well as to protect remaining ones.

AB Drainage is a major disturbance affecting wetlands, as drains lower water tables and convert lentic habitats to lotic ones. Consequently, invertebrate communities in drained wetlands are likely to differ from those in unimpacted wetlands. This study investigated the effect of hydrological restoration on invertebrate communities in small drains in a New Zealand fen. Invertebrates were collected over 4 summers from 10 drains within the wetland, one of which was blocked as part of a restoration program. The sampling protocol thus represented a Before-After Control-Impact experiment. Invertebrate community composition varied over the 4 years, but variability was greatest in the manipulated drain before and after it was blocked. Relative abundance of the amphipod Paraleptamphopus decreased after blockage, whereas those of the midges Chironomus zelandicus and Tanypodinae increased. Relative abundances of these taxa in control sites were unchanged. Hydraulic restoration thus had a demonstrable impact on the invertebrate communities. The invertebrate community of the blocked drain was compared to that of natural wetlands in undisturbed catchments. Similarity was very low prior to drain blockage, but increased following drain blockage. Invertebrate communities in the restored drain were more similar to those of low pH wetlands than high pH wetlands. Given the goal of restoring the communities to those similar to natural conditions, this was a beneficial result. These results, coupled with studies that showed a decline in the cover of alien pasture grasses around the blocked drain, suggest that drain blockage represents a cost-effective way of restoring wetland plant and aquatic invertebrate communities, especially where connectivity allows for the natural recruitment of these organisms into restored areas.

AB Drainage and cultivation have turned peatlands from carbon (C) sinks into hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Raising the water table and planting of winter cover crops are potential strategies to help reduce peat oxidation and re-initiate net C accumulation during the non-cropping period. However, the effects of these practices as well as their interactions on GHG emissions remain unclear. Here, we carried out an outdoor mesocosm experiment to elucidate the effect of water table levels (-30 cm and -50 cm) and winter cover crop cultivation (vetch, rye, no plant) on carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes during the winter period (November-April). Soil-atmosphere GHG exchange, GHG concentrations within the peat profile and soil water solute concentrations were monitored. Our results showed that high water table significantly reduced ecosystem respiration, while it had no net effect on N2O and CH4 fluxes. Uptake of available N by the cover crop significantly reduced nitrate in soil solution, thereby lowering the potential for leaching and both direct and indirect N2O emissions. No interactive effects between water table levels and cover crops were detected for any of the measured GHG fluxes. Seasonal variations of GHG fluxes were positively correlated with soil air concentrations at -15 cm and -40 cm depths, which were further regulated by dissolved organic C, nitrate concentration, and anaerobic conditions in the soil. This study suggests that there is great potential to raise water table levels and introduce green cover crops to reduce GHG emissions. Further studies are needed to achieve a complete evaluation of these strategies outside of the growing season, which may provide a significant mitigation benefit in C-rich cultivated peatlands.

AB Coastal peatlands represent an interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems; their hydrology is affected by salt and fresh water inflow alike. Previous studies on bog peat have shown that pore water salinity can have an impact on the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of peat because of chemical pore dilation effects. In this study, we aimed at quantifying the impact of higher salinities (up to 3.5% NaCl) on K-s of fen peat. Two experiments employing a constant-head upward-flow permeameter and differing in measurement and salinity change duration were conducted. Additionally, a third experiment to determine the impact of water salinity on the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the studied peat type was carried out. The results show a decrease of K-s with time, which does not depend on the water salinity but is differently shaped for different peat types. We assume pore clogging due to a conglomerate of physical, chemical, and biological processes, which rather depend on water movement rate and time than on water salinity. However, an increased water salinity did increase the DOC release. We conclude that salinity-dependent behaviour of K-s is a function of peat chemistry and that for some peat types, salinity may only affect the DOC release without having a pronounced impact on water flow.

AB To evaluate the effects of dissolved organic carbon on sorption and mobility of the insecticide imidacloprid [1-(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl) methyl-N-nitro-2-imidazolidinimine] in soils, adsorption and column experiments were performed by using a typical calcareous soil from southeastern Spain and two different types of dissolved organic carbon, that is, dissolved organic carbon extracts from a commercial peat (DOC-PE) and high-purity tannic acid (DOC-TA). The experiments were carried out from a 0.01 M CaCl2 aqueous medium at 25degreesC. The results obtained from the sorption experiments show that the presence of both DOC-PE and DOC-TA, over a concentration range of 15 to 100 mg L-1, produces in all cases a decreasing amount of imidacloprid adsorbed in the soil studied. From the column experiments the retardation coefficients (RC) were calculated for imidacloprid by using either 0.01 M CaCl2 aqueous solution (RC = 2.10) 0.01 M CaCl2 DOC-PE solution (RC = 1.65), or 0.01 M CaCl2 DOC-TA solution (RC = 1.87). The results indicate that mobility of imidacloprid is increased 21.4 and 11.0% in the presence of DOC-PE and DOC-TA solutions, respectively. Dissolved organic carbon reduces imidacloprid sorption by competing smith the pesticide molecules for sorption sites on the soil surface, allowing enhanced leaching of imidacloprid and potentially increasing ground water contamination.

ID INDICATOR VALUES
AB Due to originating from various mire or paludified forests and consequently developing after drainage under different growth conditions, the drained forests are very heterogeneous and complex. In the official Estonian forest typology, the old-drained stands are divided into Myrtillus and Oxalis site types, but recently the validity of the autonomous Dryopteris (expansa) forest site type was again asserted. The aims of the current study were to (i) elucidate the main factors determining the structure and variation of the Estonian old-drained forests, (ii) elaborate the typology of these forests at the community level and, (iii) establish the indicator species of the established community types. 118 forest stands drained not less than 35-40 years ago were analysed. According to multivariate data analyses (cluster, ordination and variance analyses, multi-response permutation procedures, indicator species analyses) it appeared that the soil reaction, nutrients, and moisture content, assessed by the Ellenberg ecological indicator values for habitats are much more significant factors for plant growth and community structure than the thickness of soil/peat horizons. Nevertheless, the litter and peat horizons in soils of drained Dryopteris site type forests are significantly thinner than in Oxalis and Myrtillus site type stands. The Dryopteris site type forests can be divided into six, the Oxalis site type forests into three, and the Myrtillu s site type forests into two types of communities. Each of the 11 established community types differ significantly (p < 0.05) from each other and have their own dominant and significant indicator species. When comparing the Estonian old-drained forests with analogous stands in neighbouring countries (Latvia, Finland, Sweden, northwestern Russia), we can find rather large similarities; the typological differences result mainly from the methodological approaches and geographical scope of countries.

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; COASTAL; NETHERLANDS; WETLANDS
AB Around 0 AD, the Rhine-Meuse estuary in the southwest of the Netherlands was a typical coastal plain estuary. Drainage of peatland and land subsidence behind the dunes later caused the sea to penetrate into the land. Most of the peat was eroded, and by 1000 AD the so-called Delta area had turned into a landscape of large estuaries and intertidal zones. Rotterdam developed from a small fishing village on the banks of the tidal river "Nieuwe Maas" from the 14th century onwards into the largest seaport of Europe in 2013. The Rotterdam harbour area situated in the northern part of the Delta area includes the former Europoort harbour, and is nowadays known as Rijnmond. The hydrology of the area is controlled by the drainage regime of the sluices in the Haringvliet barrier that was constructed as part of the "Delta Works" project to protect the southwest of the Netherlands against storm surges. The sluices are opened at slack tide to discharge river water to the sea and are always closed at flood tide.
   As a baseline study for environmental and ecological reconstruction and development, we describe in detail the loss of intertidal soft sediment ecotopes due to land reclamation, harbour development and river training works (straightening of the navigational channel) in the tidal rivers, and the expansion of hard substrate ecotopes (quay walls, groynes, training walls, riprap, concrete, stones etc.) in the Rijnmond area in the 19th and 20th centuries. Within 135 years, more than 99% of the original 4 775 ha of characteristic pristine soft sediment estuarine ecotopes have disappeared. In the same period, 338 ha of hard intertidal substrate zone was constructed. Such trends can also be observed in harbour areas elsewhere, and have ecological and environmental consequences for estuarine areas in particular.
   Restoration of soft substrate estuarine ecotopes can be achieved by opening the Haringvliet Sluices at both ebb and flood tide, which would restore large-scale estuarine dynamics to the northern part of the Rhine-Meuse estuarine system. This will have a highly favourable effect on many ecosystem services. The Dutch division of the Word Wild Life Fund has launched a new proposal for a safer and more attractive South-West Delta area. It comprises the reopening of the sea inlets such as the Haringvliet by removing the barriers, and building climate-proof dikes in combination with natural wetlands. In case of storm surges, the hinterland could be protected with a new generation of barriers that do not hamper the free transport of sediment, tides and animals. Based on 30 ecosystem services or subservices, it was calculated that opening the Haringvliet inlet would lead to an increase in Total Economic Value (TEV) of at least 500 million Euro per year. The costs of removing old barriers and the construction of new ones was not included in the calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB I determined the impact of resins canals of Bursera schlechtendalii on the growth and survival of its specialized vein-cutting beetle Blepharida sp. nov.
   Bursera schlechtendalii produces terpenes stored under pressure in networks of canals that run throughout the cortex of the stem and in the leaves. When a leaf is broken, it releases abundant resins, which may bathe the leaf surface and often form a squirt that travels for up to 150 cm. Plants vary in the proportion of their leaves that release resins after damage. Larvae of the chrysomelid genus Blepharida can inflict substantial damage to plants because they avoid the squirt response by cutting the leaf veins before consuming the leaves. Nevertheless, resins still protect plants against this insect. Both naturally occurring and experimentally placed larvae had higher mortality on highly responsive plants. Young larvae became mired in secretions after rupturing the canals and died. Also, on highly responsive plants larvae spent more time cutting veins and grew more slowly. Thus, while the squirt response of Bursera is not a completely effective defense, it imposes a handling-time cost on larvae, reduces their growth rate, and increases their mortality.

AB On a global scale, over the past 200 years peatlands have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Drainage for agriculture, forestry and peat extraction have resulted in a 16-37 per cent loss in the carbon sink capacity. The current scenarios for climate change in Britain will exacerbate this loss. A shift in the carbon balance of peatlands is not necessarily the only outcome of climate change. Indirect hydrological changes-especially alteration of the position of the peat water table-will affect the stability of peatland ecosystems. This raises a number of questions concerning the future of British peatlands: the most important of which is how will the water balance change on a regional scale? In Britain the potential response of peatlands to climate change varies spatially. In upland areas, where rainfall is the main source of water, the key question is will erosion increase and if so, how fast? It will also be important to establish the drainage network response in terms of run-off, sediment loading and stream water quality. Increased precipitation may increase the rate of sedimentation in reservoirs thus affecting their water-holding capacity and water quality. Enhanced decomposition at elevated temperatures may also increase the microbial release of humic acids and increase the incidence of colour in upland waters which will in turn increase the cost of water quality treatment. In lowland Britain, the increased flood risk and more or less permanently elevated water table (as a result of both a rising sea level and sinking land surface) may enable peat regeneration through paludification. Key areas that are likely to be affected have spring or floodwater as their main source of water. They include the Norfolk Broads, Suffolk valley peats, Cambridgeshire Fens, Humberhead Levels, Derwent Ings and possibly the Somerset and Gwent Levels. In order to minimize the effects of climate change on peatlands and to preserve their existing carbon sink capacity (however small) they must remain hydrologically intact, and as high a water table as possible must be maintained. This may be possible in low-lying areas if flooding reinstates paludification but the process of peat regeneration is a slow one. In upland areas the effect of climate change is less clear; increased precipitation may encourage peat formation but it may also result in greater erosion.

AB The large western Irish lakes are natural salmonid lakes and a unique ecological resource. Lough Mask (82 km(2)) and Lough Conn (50 km(2)), Co. Mayo, are among the finest, natural, wild brown trout fisheries in Europe. Recently, however, threats have arisen to water quality in Lough Conn as a result of agricultural intensification. A doubling of phosphorus (P) inputs to Lough Conn for the period 1980 to 1990 caused a number of ecological changes such as an apparent increase in littoral algal production; while arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) have also disappeared from the lake over the same period of time. The changes in Lough Conn appear to represent an early phase in the eutrophication process. The western Irish lakes represent a super-sensitive ecological category requiring particularly strict catchment controls in order to protect the diversity of native flora and fauna including unusual glacial relict species and the unique genetic strains of fish which are present. Catchment management committees were established in order to study and reverse the perceived early-stage eutrophication problem in Lough Conn and in order to prevent the occurrence of similar problems in the case of Lough Mask. These committees have a sectoral basis covering: agriculture, local authority functions (sewage, rural septic tanks, planning and environmental control), forestry, peat harvesting and drainage works, as well as having representation from the fisheries boards and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Management of these relatively pristine lakes is perhaps a more difficult problem than that of cleaning up an obviously degraded resource. This is especially so since they are located in regions which are economically underdeveloped and where a real need exists to improve economic returns from farming, tourism and industry in the catchments. The importance of developing a sustainable, ecologically-based management strategy which will maintain existing high quality lakes into the next century with their irreplaceable genetic and ecological resources intact cannot be over-emphasised. The challenge is to devise refined management strategies which will eliminate nutrient wastage to waters and yet allow an appropriate level of sustainable development in the area. The management of Lough Conn and Lough Mask is described in some detail concentrating in particular on the efforts to reduce phosphorus loss from agriculture in the catchment but also emphasising the importance of a multi-sectoral approach to phosphorus load reduction.

AB Here we investigate the vegetation history and peat accumulation at the eastern boarder of the West Siberian Plain, near the Yenisey River, south of permafrost. In this region, peat started to accumulate 15 000 years ago as gyttja of shallow lakes in ancient river valleys. This peat is older than previously reported, mainly due to separating particulate organic carbon (POC) from dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which was 1900-6500 years younger than POC. The probability of finding peat layers older than 12 000 years is about 2 %. Peat accumulated as fen peat at a constant rate of 0.2 mm yr(-1) and 0.01 kg C m(-2) yr(-1). The accumulation was higher in ancient river valley environments. Over the last 2000 years these bogs changed into Sphagnum mires which have accumulated up to about 0.1 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) until present.
   The long-lasting fen stage, which makes the Yenisey bogs distinct from the western Siberian bogs, is discussed as a consequence of the local hydrology. The high accumulation rate of peat in unfrozen mires is taken as an indication that thawing of permafrost peat may also change northern peatlands into long-lasting carbon sinks.

AB The aquatic colonial stalked diatom, Didymosphenia geminata, has acquired notoriety in recent years because of huge increases in many rivers of temperate regions. However, in some streams in northern England it has probably or, in the case of the R. Coquet (Northumberland), certainly been abundant for many decades. The paper describes the nutrient environment and phosphatase activities of Didymosphenia in Stony Gill (N. Yorkshire), a fast-flowing stream draining an upland catchment with peaty soils overlying limestone. Organic phosphate formed 85% of the filtrable phosphate in the water during the study (January-August 2000), with a maximum in April. Colonies were most abundant in June, but had disappeared by August. Surface phosphomonoesterase (PMEase) and phosphodiesterase activities assayed from March to July showed low PMEase activity in early March, but otherwise both were high throughout the period and especially so in June and July. Use of BCIP-NBT staining procedure showed that PMEase activity occurred in the stalks. A more detailed study of colony structure and staining with material from the R. Coquet in June 2006 also showed marked PMEase activity, with staining localized in the upper part of the stalks and the cells remaining unstained. It is suggested that organic phosphate is hydrolyzed in the stalk and the inorganic phosphate passes to the cell via a central tube in the stalk. It seems likely that organic phosphate as a major P source is a key factor favouring the success of Didymosphenia. The possible impact of environmental changes in the catchment such as climatic warming, C loss from peat and atmospheric N deposition is discussed.

AB Following a summer drought, intact cores of peat soil from two cool temperate peatlands (a rain-fed bog and a groundwater-fed swamp) were exposed experimentally to three different water table levels. The goal was to examine recovery of anaerobic methanogenesis and to evaluate peat soil decomposition to methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) upon rewetting. Methane emission from soils to the atmosphere was greatest (mean = 80 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) when the entire peat core was rewetted quickly; emission was negligible at low water level and when peat cores were rewetted gradually. Rates of CO2 emission (mean = 1.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were relatively insensitive to water level. Concentrations of CH4 in soil air spaces suggest that onset of methanogenesis induces, but later represses, aerobic oxidation of CH4 above the water table. Concentrations of CO2 suggest production at the soil surface of swamp peat versus at greater depths in bog peat. Portions of peat soil incubated in vitro without oxygen (O-2) exhibited a lag before the onset of methanogenesis, and the lag time was less in peat from the cores rewetted quickly. The inhibition of methanogenesis by the selective inhibitor 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (BES) decreased CO2 production by 20 to 30% but resulted in an increase in concentrations of DOC by 2 to 5 times. The results show that methanogens in peat soils tolerate moderate drought, and recovery varies among different peat types. In peat soils, the inhibition of methanogenesis might enhance DOC availability.

AB Mass balances of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) based on stream and precipitation inputs and outflows were measured for seven unproductive lakes in central Ontario between 1981 and 1989. Net annual CO2 evasion occurred in six of the seven study lakes with minor net invasion in the seventh. Atmospheric invasion might have been significant at certain times of the year, particularly during the growing season. Net evasion rates were greater than DIC loading rates, indicating partial mineralization of the terrestrially-derive DOC in the lakes. A steady state mass balance model adequately described the variation in DOC retention between lakes. Net annual carbon accumulation of forest communities based on estimates of net ecosystem production may be overestimated because of significant export of carbon to lakes via streams and groundwater, particularly in catchments with extensive peatlands.

AB Prescribed burning of moorland, heathland and blanket bog vegetation on peatlands in the UK is a contentious issue. Given the large carbon store in these peatlands, concern ha:; been raised over land management and its effect on the carbon dynamics of peat ecosystems. In particular the spatial and temporal link between burning and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in waters draining these catchments has received particular attention. This study investigates water colour and DOC concentrations in soil pore water and runoff water at the plot-scale over a chronosequence of burn ages. Results from this study show that there is an elevated water colour in the few years immediately following burning but that this is not matched by a rise in DOC concentration. Therefore we propose that burning appears to affect the composition of the DOC rather than the absolute DOC concentration. This study also highlights that in some cases the use of water colour as a proxy for DOC concentration should be treated with caution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Here we used organic composition and stable isotopic analysis to evaluate the effects of drainage and restoration at an ombrotrophic peatiand, to assess whether rewetting of blanket bogs will reverse degradation. The organic composition of the peat and the isotopic fractionation between the solid (peat), liquid (pore water) and gas (soil gas) phases on actively accumulating, degrading and restored locations are compared. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the organic material has shown a high level of humification (low decomposition) in the active peat. Stable isotope analysis in the solid, liquid and gas phases has corresponded with this and indicated that the active location is enriched in C-13 in the solid and gas phases, N-15 in the solid phase, O-18 in the liquid and gas phases and Din the liquid phase, suggesting a closed system with limited isotopic fractionation and thus limited water movement and decomposition. The degrading location has a lower level of humification, and is depleted in C-13 in the solid phase due to ingression of vascular plants. The restored location has high humification and enrichment of C-13 and N-15 in the solid phase, and Din the liquid phase suggesting increased microbial activity. C-13 and O-18 in the gas phase and O-18 in the liquid phase are depleted, as a result of microbial mediated gas production and rewetting. FTIR analysis has also indicated a subsurface zone of increased decomposition between the acrotelm and catotelm in both the active and degrading peat. This is due to a stable water table and is not present within the restored location, which we attribute to water table fluctuation associated with rewetting. This zone of increased decomposition adds to the complexity of blanket bog peatlands and the assumption that all systems can be generalized under one conceptual model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent finds of Jamesoniella undulifolia in the Massif Central allowed the authors to make a better approach to the ecological requirements of this sporadic species. Indeed, it had not been found in France for over 50 years. This work was carried out in several departements of the following Regions : Auvergne, Languedoc- Roussi lion and Rhone-Alpes. The stress is put on the pioneer status of the taxon by studying its behaviour from the hill level to the sub-alpine one. The study of Sphagnum hummocks shows that the conservation conditions and vitality of this living substrate totality rule the spreading of the Janiesoniella population.
   A theoretical model of the dynamics of Jamesoniella undulifolia populations is suggested. This is based on the synchronous variation of Sphagnum growth together with the spreading of liverworts. On the basis of this large amount of new data, the French current distribution of Jamesoniella undidifolia is proposed, and its altitudinal affinity and local distribution are underlined. Antheridial structure and phenotypic flexibility are investigated thanks to the occurrence of both sterile and sporophyte-bearing populations. A high number of bryosociologic releves carried out in about that fifteen stations made it possible to propose a very original new bryologic association. Jamesonielletum undulifoliae belongs to the class of Mylietea anomalae, a bryosociologic class made up of communities of colonizing liverworts at the pioneer stage that stread over living Sphagnum populations, beginning with their growth phase and ending with their withering phase. Major threats are the intensification of farming practices (overgrazing, draining...) and general decrease of peaty areas due to human activities. The occurrence and the way in which those populations are able to grow may afford a good biocoenotic signal of the state of conservation of peat bogs, mostly at the medium mountain level.

AB Peatlands occupy approximately 15% of boreal and sub-arctic regions, contain approximately one third of the world's soil carbon pool, and supply most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) entering boreal lakes and rivers and the Arctic Ocean. The high latitudes occupied by these peatlands are expected to see the greatest amount of climatic warming in the next several decades. In addition to increasing temperatures, climatic change could also affect the position of the water-table level and discharge from these peatlands. Changes in temperature, water tables, and discharge could affect delivery of DOC to downstream ecosystems where it exerts significant control over productivity, biogeochemical cycles, and attenuation of visible and UV radiation. We experimentally warmed and controlled water tables while measuring discharge in a factorial experiment in large mesocosms containing peat monoliths and intact plant communities from a bog and fen to determine the effects of climate change on DOC budgets. We show that the DOC budget is controlled largely by changes in discharge rather than by any effect of warming or position of the water-table level on DOC concentrations. Furthermore, we identify a critical discharge rate in bogs and fens for which the DOC budget switches from net export to net retention. We also demonstrate an exponential increase in trace gas CO2-C and CH4-C emissions coincident with increased retention of dissolved organic carbon from boreal peatlands.

AB More reliable assessments of nutrient export to surface waters and the Baltic Sea are required to achieve good ecological status of all water bodies. Previous nutrient export estimates have recently been questioned since they did not include the long-term impacts of drainage for forestry. We made new estimates of the total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P) and total organic carbon (TOC) export from forests to surface waters at different spatial scales in Finland. This was done by formulating statistical equations between streamwater concentrations and climate, soil, forest management and runoff variables and spatial data on catchment characteristics. The equations were based on a large, long-term runoff and streamwater quality dataset, which was collected from 28 pristine and 61 managed boreal forest catchments located around Finland. We found that the concentrations increased with temperature sum (TS), i.e. from north to south. Nitrogen, P and TOC concentrations increased with the proportion of drained areas in the catchment; those of N and TOC also increased with the proportion of peatlands. In contrast, with the increasing concentrations of N and TOC with time, P concentrations showed a decreasing trend over the last few decades. According to our estimates, altogether 47,300 Mg of N, 1780 Mg of P and 1814 Gg of TOC is transported from forest areas to surface waters in Finland. Forest management contributes 17% of the N export, 35% of the P export and 12% of the TOC export. Our new forest management export estimates for N and P are more than two times higher than the old estimates used by the environment authorities. The differences may be explained by the long-term impact of forest drainage. The spatial results indicate that peatland forests are hotspots for N, P and TOC export, especially in the river basins draining to the Gulf of Bothnia. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are long term carbon catchments that sink atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and source methane (CH4). in the uplands of the United Kingdom ombrotrophic blanket peatlands commonly exist within Calluna vulgaris (L.) dominated moorland ecosystems. These landscapes contain a range of topographical features that influence local hydrology, climate and plant community composition. In this study we examined the variation in ecosystem CO2 respiration and net CH4 fluxes from typical plant-soil systems in dendritic drainage gullies and adjacent blanket peat during the growing season. Typically, Eriophorum spp., Sphagnum spp. and mixed grasses occupied gullies while C. uulgaris dominated in adjacent blanket peat. Gross CO2 respiration was highest in the areas of Eriophorum spp. (650 +/- 140 Mg CO2 m(-2)h(-1)) compared to those with Sphagnum spp. (338 +/- 49 mg CO2 m(-2)h(-1)), mixed grasses (342 +/- 91 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) and C. vulgaris (174 +/- 63 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)). Measurements of the net CH4 flux showed higher fluxes from the Eriophorum spp (2.2 +/- 0.6 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) locations compared to the Sphagnurn spp. (0.6 +/- 0.4 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), mixed grasses (0.1 +/- 0.1 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) and a negligible flux detected from C. uulgaris (0.0 +/- 0.0 mg CH4 m(-2)h(-1)) locations. A GIS approachwas applied to calculate the contribution of gullies to landscape scale greenhouse gas fluxes. Findings from the Moor House National Nature Reserve in the UK showed that although gullies occupied only 9.3% of the total land surface, gullies accounted for 95.8% and 21.6% of the peatland net CH4 and CO2 respiratory fluxes, respectively. The implication of these findings is that the relative contribution of characteristic gully systems need to be considered in estimates of landscape scale peatland greenhouse gas fluxes.

AB Global peatlands store an unparalleled proportion of total global organic carbon but it is vulnerable to erosion into fluvial systems. Fluvial networks are being recognized as areas of carbon transformation, with eroded particulate organic carbon processed to dissolved organic carbon and CO2. Existing studies indicate biodegradation and photodegradation as key processes controlling the transformation of organic carbon in fluvial systems, with initial concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) identified as a control on the rate of carbon mineralization. This study manipulates temperature and incident light intensity to investigate carbon mineralization rates in laboratory simulations of peatland sediment transport into fluvial systems. By directly measuring gaseous CO2 emissions from sampled stream water, the relationship of temperature and light intensity with carbon efflux is identified. In simulations where sediment (as particulate organic matter, POM) is absent, temperature is consistently the dominant factor influencing carbon efflux rates. This influence is independent of the initial DOC concentration of the water sample. In simulations where POM was added, representing a peatland river receiving eroded terrestrial sediment, initial DOC concentration predicts 79% of the variation in total gaseous carbon efflux whereas temperature and light intensity predict 12% and 3%, respectively. When sampled stream water's mineralization rates in the presence of added POM are analysed independently, removing DOC as a model variable, the dominant variable affecting CO2 efflux is opposite for each sample. This study presents novel data suggesting peatland erosion introduces further complexity to dynamic stream systems where rates of carbon transformation processes and the influence of specific environmental variables are interdependent. Anthropogenic climate change is identified as a leading risk factor perpetuating peatland erosion; therefore, understanding the fate of terrestrial sediment in rivers and further quantifying the benefits of protecting peatland soils will be of increasing importance to carbon budgeting and ecosystem function studies.

AB Small headwater fens at high elevations exist in the dry climatic regime of western Colorado, despite increasing demands for water development since the 1800's. Fens on Grand Mesa have accumulated plant material as peat for thousands of years due to cold temperatures and consistently saturated soils. The peatlands maintain unique plant communities, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and carbon storage. We located and differentiated 88 fens from 15 wet meadows and 2 marshes on Grand Mesa. Field work included determining vegetation, soils, moisture regimes, and impacts from human activities. All fens were groundwater-supported systems that occurred in depressions and slopes within sedimentary landslide and volcanic glacial till landscapes. Fens occupied 400 ha or less than 1 % of the 46,845 ha research area and ranged in size from 1 to 46 ha. Peat water pH in undisturbed sites ranged from 4.3 to 7.1. Most fens had plant communities dominated by sedges (Carex) with an understory of brown mosses. Variation in vegetation was controlled by stand wetness, water table level, organic C, conductivity (EC), and temperature A degrees C. Fen soils ranged from 13.6 to 44.1 % organic C with a mean of 30.3 %. Species diversity in fens was restricted by cold short growing seasons, stressful anaerobic conditions, and disturbance. Multivariate analysis was used to analyze relationships between vegetation, environmental, and impact variables. Stand wetness, water table level, OC, electrical conductivity (EC), and temperature were used to analyze vegetation variance in undisturbed fens, wet meadows, and marshes. Vegetation composition in impacted fens was influenced by flooding, sedimentation, stand wetness, water table level, OC, EC, and temperature. Hydrologically modified fens supported 58 plant species compared to 101 species in undisturbed fens. Analysis of historical 1936-2007 aerial photographs and condition scalars helped quantify impacts of human activities in fens as well as vegetation changes. Fourteen fens had evidence of peat subsidence, from organic soil collapse, blocks of peat in the margins, soil instability, and differences in surface peat height between the fen soil surface and the annually flooded soil surface. Of 374 ha of fens in the Grand Mesa study area, 294 ha (79 %) have been impacted by human activities such as ditching, drainage, flooding, or vehicular rutting. Many fens had little restoration potential due to severe hydrological and peat mass impacts, water rights, or the cost of restoration.

AB Waterborne carbon (C) export from terrestrial ecosystems is a potentially important flux for the net catchment C balance and links the biogeochemical C cycling of terrestrial ecosystems to their downstream aquatic ecosystems. We have monitored hydrology and stream chemistry over 3 years in ten nested catchments (0.6-15.1km(2)) with variable peatland cover (0%-22%) and groundwater influence in subarctic Sweden. Total waterborne C export, including dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), ranged between 2.8 and 7.3gm(-2)year(-1), representing similar to 10%-30% of catchment net ecosystem exchange of CO2. Several characteristics of catchment waterborne C export were affected by interacting effects of peatland cover and groundwater influence, including magnitude and timing, partitioning into DOC, POC, and DIC and chemical composition of the exported DOC. Waterborne C export was greater during the wetter years, equivalent to an average change in export of similar to 2gm(-2)year(-1) per 100mm of precipitation. Wetter years led to a greater relative increase in DIC export than DOC export due to an inferred relative shift in dominance from shallow organic flow pathways to groundwater sources. Indices of DOC composition (SUVA(254) and a(250)/a(365)) indicated that DOC aromaticity and average molecular weight increased with catchment peatland cover and decreased with increased groundwater influence. Our results provide examples on how waterborne C export and DOC composition might be affected by climate change. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Globally, peat lands are considered to be a sink of CO2, but a source when drained. Additionally, wet peat lands are thought to emit considerable amounts of CH4 and N2O. Hitherto, reliable and integrated estimates of emissions and emission factors for this type of land cover have been lacking and the effects of wetland restoration on methane emissions have been poorly quantified. In this paper we estimate the full greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a restored natural peat land by determining the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O through atmosphere and water, while accounting for the different Global Warming Potentials (GWP's).
   The site is an abandoned agricultural peat meadow, which has been converted into a wetland nature reserve ten years ago, after which the water level was raised. GHG fluxes were measured continuously with an eddy covariance system (CO2) and flux chamber measurements (CH4 and N2O). Meteorological and hydrological measurements were collected as well. With growing seasons of respectively 192, 168 and 129 days, the annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was -446+ +/- 83 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, -311 +/- 58 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and -232 +/- 57 g m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. Ecosystem respiration (Reco) was estimated as 869 +/- 668 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2004, 866 +/- 666 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 924 +/- 711 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. CH4 emissions from the saturated land and water surfaces were high compared to the relatively dry land. Annual weighted CH4 emissions were 31.27 +/- 20.40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2005 and 32.27 +/- 21.08 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for 2006. N2O fluxes were too low to be of significance. The water balance of the area was dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration and therefore fluxes of carbon and CH4 through seepage, infiltration and drainage were relatively small (17.25 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The carbon- balance consisted for the largest part of CO2 uptake, CO2 respiration and CH4 emission from water saturated land and water. CO2 emission has decreased significantly as result of the raised water table, while CH4 fluxes have increased. In GWP's the area was a small net GHG sink given as CO2- equiv. of - 86 g m(-2) yr(-1) (over a 100-year period).

AB Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) release from peatlands are closely related to water management and soil degradation. However, peat degradation has not been explicitly accounted for when estimating national greenhouse gas inventories. Here, we assembled a comprehensive dataset covering European, Russian and Canadian peatlands and introduced soil bulk density (BD) as a proxy for peat degradation to estimate nitrous oxide (N2O) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release. The results show that physical and biogeochemical properties of peat are sensitive to soil degradation. The BD is superior to other parameters (C/N, pH) to estimate annual N2O emissions and DOC pore water concentrations. The more a peat soil is degraded, the higher the risk of air/water pollution in peaty landscapes. Even after rewetting, highly degraded soils may exhibit high N2O release rates. The estimated annual N2O-N emissions from European, Russian and Canadian degraded peatlands sum up to approximately 81.0 Gg. The derived BD-based functions can assist in computing global matter fluxes from peatlands.

AB We monitored changing groundwater-surface water interactions during a drought with a 10 year return period in a 3.2 km(2) catchment in the Scottish Highlands. The montane catchment is underlain by granite and metasediments and has extensive cover of diverse drift deposits (70%), which are up to 40 m deep. Flat valley bottom areas fringing the stream channel are characterised by deep peat soil (0.5-4 m deep) which covers about 20% of the catchment and receive drainage from upslope areas. The drought resulted in small declines in soil moisture and groundwater levels in the valley bottom wetlands, but marked, rapid declines on steeper upland slopes. These coincided with gradual decreases in discharge; however, the chemical and isotopic composition of reduced stream flows showed both temporal and spatial variation. Synoptic hydrogeochemical surveys were carried out on four occasions as flows declined. Each survey repeated sampling of 26 sites along the 3 km long stream network. Samples were analysed for major anions, cations and water isotopes. Initial surveys just after the last winter rain showed relatively homogenous stream chemistry, consistent with dominant near-surface drainage from acidic riparian peat soils. Stream chemistry became increasingly enriched with weathering-derived solutes (e.g. alkalinity, Ca2+, Mg2+, etc.) as flows declined and groundwater dominance of flow increased. However, these changes showed marked spatial variability implying geochemical differences in the bedrock geology and the distribution of storage in drift deposits. Temporal dynamics inferred heterogeneous montane groundwater bodies contributed to flows differentially during the recession. Isotope data indicated that in places the stream was also influenced by evaporative losses from the surface of the peat soils. The largest sources of groundwater appear to be located in the drift in the lower catchment where the most marked increase in weathering-derived ions occurred, and depleted, non-fractionated isotope signatures implied deeper inflows.

AB Understanding stream carbon export dynamics is needed to accurately predict how the carbon balance of peatland catchments will respond to climatic and environmental change. We used a 12year record (2003-2014) of continuous streamflow and manual spot measurements of total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane (CH4), and organic carbon quality (carbon-specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm per dissolved organic carbon) to assess interannual and seasonal variability in stream carbon export for a peatland catchment (70% mire and 30% forest cover) in northern Sweden. Mean annual total carbon export for the 12year period was 12.2 gCm(-2) yr(-1), but individual years ranged between 6 and 18 gCm(-2) yr(-1). TOC, which was primarily composed of dissolved organic carbon (>99%), was the dominant form of carbon being exported, comprising 63% to 79% of total annual exports, and DIC contributed between 19% and 33%. CH4 made up less than 5% of total export. When compared to previously published annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for the studied peatland system, stream carbon export typically accounted for 12 to 50% of NEE for most years. However, in 2006 stream carbon export accounted for 63 to 90% (estimated uncertainty range) of NEE due to a dry summer which suppressed NEE, followed by a wet autumn that resulted in considerable stream export. Runoff exerted a primary control on stream carbon export from this catchment; however, our findings suggest that seasonal variations in biologic and hydrologic processes responsible for production and transport of carbon within the peatland were secondary influences on stream carbon export. Consideration of these seasonal dynamics is needed when predicting stream carbon export response to environmental change.

AB Peatland ecosystem services include drinking water provision, flood mitigation, habitat provision and carbon sequestration. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal is a key treatment process for the supply of potable water downstream from peat-dominated catchments. A transition from peat-forming Sphagnum moss to vascular plants has been observed in peatlands degraded by (a) land management, (b) atmospheric deposition and (c) climate change. Here within we show that the presence of vascular plants with higher annual above-ground biomass production leads to a seasonal addition of labile plant material into the peatland ecosystem as litter recalcitrance is lower. The net effect will be a smaller litter carbon pool due to higher rates of decomposition, and a greater seasonal pattern of DOC flux. Conventional water treatment involving coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation may be impeded by vascular plant-derived DOC. It has been shown that vascular plant-derived DOC is more difficult to remove via these methods than DOC derived from Sphagnum, whilst also being less susceptible to microbial mineralisation before reaching the treatment works. These results provide evidence that practices aimed at re-establishing Sphagnum moss on degraded peatlands could reduce costs and improve efficacy at water treatment works, offering an alternative to 'end-of-pipe' solutions through management of ecosystem service provision.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) originating in peatlands can be mineralized to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), two potent greenhouse gases. Knowledge of the dynamics of DOC export via run-off is needed for a more robust quantification of C cycling in peatland ecosystems, a prerequisite for realistic predictions of future climate change. We studied dispersion pathways of DOC in a mountain-top peat bog in the Czech Republic (Central Europe), using a dual isotope approach. Although delta C-13(DOC) values made it possible to link exported DOC with its within-bog source, delta O-18(H2O) values of precipitation and run-off helped to understand run-off generation. Our 2-year DOC-H2O isotope monitoring was complemented by a laboratory peat incubation study generating an experimental time series of delta C-13(DOC) values. DOC concentrations in run-off during high-flow periods were 20-30 mg L-1. The top 2 cm of the peat profile, composed of decaying green moss, contained isotopically lighter C than deeper peat, and this isotopically light C was present in run-off in high-flow periods. In contrast, baseflow contained only 2-10 mg DOC L-1, and its more variable C isotope composition intermittently fingerprinted deeper peat. DOC in run-off occasionally contained isotopically extremely light C whose source in solid peat substrate was not identified. Pre-event water made up on average 60% of the water run-off flux, whereas direct precipitation contributed 40%. Run-off response to precipitation was relatively fast. A highly leached horizon was identified in shallow catotelm. This peat layer was likely affected by a lateral influx of precipitation. Within 36 days of laboratory incubation, isotopically heavy DOC that had been initially released from the peat was replaced by isotopically lighter DOC, whose delta C-13 values converged to the solid substrate and natural run-off. We suggest that delta C-13 systematics can be useful in identification of vertically stratified within-bog DOC sources for peatland run-off.

AB Arctic sources of greenhouse gas associated with permafrost degradation constitute a large uncertainty in existing climate models. Greenhouse gas release from the Arctic subsurface is mediated by numerous interconnected physical processes; one facet of these is the interplay between surface deformation and melting of subsurface ice. First, we construct analytic solutions describing fluid drainage and soil subsidence subsequent to thawing of a 1-D permafrost column. These solutions lead to formulas giving the total amount of subsidence as well as the time over which subsidence occurs. We give an example application of the analytic model to peat plateau degradation in the Canadian Hudson Bay Lowland and show that the degree of subsidence predicted from our model is consistent with recorded subsidence of peat in western Norway that was drained for cultivation purposes. Second, we numerically model an initially frozen, fluid-saturated, 2-D soil matrix with a thaw zone advancing from the surface downward. With the surface temperature fixed at 5 degrees C, a thaw front propagates to similar to 10 m depth within 20 years, and due primarily to drainage of fluid from the pore space, a region of soil depressed by similar to 3 m forms above an initially ice-rich subsurface zone. Soil underlying this depressed zone may have its permeability reduced by between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude; this reduction in permeability can act as a negative feedback to thawing.

AB Peatlands are important environments for the transformation of atmospherically deposited inorganic mercury into the bioaccumulative form, methylmercury (MeHg), which may accumulate in downstream aquatic biota, particularly in fish. In recent research, it was suggested that MeHg production and/or accumulation "hot spots" at the upland-peatland interface were the result of upland fluxes of sulfate and labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the peatland margin. Along the upland-peatland interface, spatial heterogeneity of "hot spots" was thought to be a result of variations in upland hydrologic interaction with the peatland margin. This hypothesis was tested in this study. Pore water MeHg, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were compared in peatland plots at the base of both topographically concave and linear upland subcatcments in Minnesota. Subcatchment contributing areas were 3-8 times larger in the peatland plots adjacent to areas of concave upland topography. Peat pore water MeHg concentrations were significantly higher in these plots. Fluxes of water, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the upland hillslope into the peatland margin were also generally much larger than those from below areas of concave upland topography. Taken together, these results suggest that watershed geomorphology plays an important role in controlling chemical fluxes into peatland margins and consequently MeHg production and accumulation. It may thus be possible to delineate areas of high MeHg production and/or accumulation in certain watersheds by using high-resolution topographic data. The resulting MeHg "hot spots" may be important for locally foraging biota and for downstream loading, especially in the spring and fall.

AB 1. Forest drainage, including mainly ditching of waterlogged peatlands in order to increase wood growth, has caused substantial changes in the hydrology and water quality of Finnish streams. However, knowledge on the ecological impact of these changes is poor. This paper studies the potential impact of forest drainage, catchment characteristics and habitat factors on the water quality and benthic macroinvertebrates in headwater streams of the River Isojoki, western Finland. An intensive programme of water sampling was carried out at nine study sites, while zoobenthic samples covered a total of 18 streams.
   2. According to multivariate regression models concentrations of aluminium and suspended solids in stream water at nine study sites increased significantly with increasing forest drainage of the catchment area. Further, drainage intensity contributed significantly to the decrease in minimum values of alkalinity.
   3. In a Canonical Correspondence Analysis, the variation in macroinvertebrate species distribution and abundance was largely explained by drainage intensity, moss coverage and the concentrations of aluminium and iron in stream water. A significant positive correlation was established between the species richness of benthic macroinvertebrates and the proportional cover of vegetation on the stream bed, whereas a significant negative correlation was found between species richness and sand cover.
   4. The results suggest that drainage has significantly contributed to the deterioration of water quality and habitat structure, and impoverishment of benthic communities in the headwater streams of the River Isojoki. In order to protect the ecological integrity of such boreal headwater streams, more effective protection schemes in forestry practices and rehabilitation of the adversely affected streams and their catchment areas are needed.

AB Radiocarbon (C-14) is a key tracer for detecting the mobilization of previously stored terrestrial organic carbon (C) into aquatic systems. Old C (>1,000years BP) may be masked by postbomb C (fixed from the atmosphere post-1950 CE), potentially rendering bulk aquatic dissolved organic C (DOC) C-14 measurements insensitive to old C. We collected DOC with a modern C-14 signature from a temperate Scottish peatland stream and decomposed it to produce CO2 under simulated natural conditions over 140days. We measured the C-14 of both DOC and CO2 at seven time points and found that while DOC remained close to modern in age, the resultant CO2 progressively increased in age up to 2,356767years BP. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the bulk (DOC)-C-14 pool can hide the presence of old C within peatland stream DOC export, demonstrating that bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements can be an insensitive indicator of peatland disturbance. Our experiment also demonstrates that this old C component is biologically and photochemically available for conversion to the greenhouse gas CO2, and as such, bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements do not reflect the C-14 signature of the labile organic C pool exported by inland water systems more broadly. Moreover, our experiment suggests that old C may be an important component of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from peatland aquatic systems, with implications for tracing and modeling interactions between the hydrological and terrestrial C cycles.
   Plain Language Summary The introduction of old carbon previously stored in soils for thousands of years into rivers can increase the net flux of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, impacting global climate. This is because rivers transport the equivalent of one third of human carbon emissions annually from land to the oceans. Much river-borne carbon is plant and soil (organic) matter that can decompose during transport, releasing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon dating can reveal the age of river-borne carbon, but previous measurements may have underestimated the age of carbon released into rivers by not considering the potential for old carbon hidden within individual bulk water samples. Using an incubation experiment, we demonstrate that dissolved organic carbon from a Scottish peatland stream that would be considered modern in age using traditional bulk radiocarbon dating can readily decompose to produce carbon dioxide with an old radiocarbon signature up to similar to 2,500years old. This demonstrates that radiocarbon dating of bulk riverine dissolved organic carbon can hide the presence of old carbon. Furthermore, these results indicate that old carbon may be more common in the global carbon cycle than previously thought, with important implications for our understanding and modeling of peatland ecosystems.

AB The importance of colloids and organic deposits for the transport of uranium isotopes from continental source regions and through the estuarine environment was investigated in the mire-rich Kalix River drainage basin in northern Sweden and the Baltic Sea. Ultrafiltration techniques were used to separate uranium and other elements associated with colloids > 10 kD and >3 kD from ''solute'' uranium and provided consistent results and high recovery rates for uranium as well as for other elements from large volume samples.
   Uranium concentrations in 0.45 mu m-filtered Kalix River water samples increased by a factor of 3 from near the headwaters in the Caledonides to the river mouth while major cation concentrations were relatively constant. U-234/U-238 ratios were high (delta(234)U = 770-1500) throughout the basin, without showing any simple pattern, and required a supply of U-234-rich water. Throughout the Kalix River, a large fraction (30-90%) of the uranium is carried by >10 kD colloids, which is compatible with uranium complexation with humic acids. No isotopic differences were found between colloid-associated and solute uranium.
   Within the Baltic Sea, about half of the uranium is removed at low salinities. The proportion that is lost is equivalent to that of river-derived colloid-bound uranium, suggesting that while solute uranium behaves conservatively during estuarine mixing, colloid-bound uranium is lost due to rapid flocculation of colloidal material. The association of uranium with colloids therefore may be an important parameter in determining uranium estuarine behavior.
   Mire peats in the Kalix River highly concentrate uranium and are potentially a significant source of recoil U-234 to the mirewaters and river waters. However, mirewater data clearly demonstrate that only small U-234/U-238 shifts are generated relative to inflowing groundwater. A simple box model of uranium accumulation in peat and transport through the mire that is compatible with the mire data demonstrates that with efficient removal of uranium from solution, only small shifts in U-234/U-238 ratios can be generated in mirewater uranium. The measurements and model calculations show that mirewaters are not the primary source of the uranium in the river. Bedrock groundwaters with high U-234/U-238 ratios and uranium concentrations must be the dominant source of riverine uranium. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Subsurface flow through peat plays a critical role in the hydrology of organic-covered, permafrost terrains, which occupy a large part the continental arctic, sub-arctic, and boreal regions. Hillslope drainage in these terrains occurs predominantly through the active flow zone between the relatively impermeable frost table and the water table above it. The hydraulic conductivity profile within this zone controls the subsurface drainage of snowmelt and storm water. Peat hydraulic conductivity profiles were examined at three sites in north-western Canada, each representing a widely occurring organic-covered, permafrost terrain type. Three independent measures of saturated hydraulic conductivity were used-tracer tests, constant-head wellpermeameter tests, and laboratory measurements of undisturbed samples. At all three sites, the conductivity profiles contained very high values (10- 1000 m d(-1)) within the top ca 0. 1 m where the peat is only lightly decomposed, a large reduction with increasing depth below the ground surface in the transition zone, and relatively low values in a narrow range (0-5-5 m d(-1)) below ca 0.2 m depth, where the peat is in an advanced state of decomposition. Digital image analysis of resin-impregnated peat samples showed that hydraulic conductivity is essentially controlled by pore hydraulic radius. The strong dependence of hydraulic conductivity on hydraulic radius implies that peat soils subjected to similar degrees of decomposition and compaction have a similar hydraulic conductivity regardless of the location. This explains the similarity of the depth-conductivity profiles among all three terrain types. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The combination of two well-established methods, of quadrocopter-borne air sampling and methane isotopic analyses, is applied to determine the source process of methane at different altitudes and to study mixing processes. A proof-of-concept study was performed to demonstrate the capabilities of quadrocopter air sampling for subsequently analysing the methane isotopic composition delta C-13 in the laboratory. The advantage of the system compared to classical sampling on the ground and at tall towers is the flexibility concerning sampling location, and in particular the flexible choice of sampling altitude, allowing the study of the layering and mixing of air masses with potentially different spatial origin of air masses and methane. Boundary layer mixing processes and the methane isotopic composition were studied at Polder Zarnekow in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania in the north-east of Germany, which has become a strong source of biogenically produced methane after rewetting the drained and degraded peatland. Methane fluxes are measured continuously at the site. They show high emissions from May to September, and a strong diurnal variability. For two case studies on 23 May and 5 September 2018, vertical profiles of temperature and humidity were recorded up to an altitude of 650 and 1000 m, respectively, during the morning transition. Air samples were taken at different altitudes and analysed in the laboratory for methane isotopic composition. The values showed a different isotopic composition in the vertical distribution during stable conditions in the morning (delta values of 51.5% below the temperature inversion at an altitude of 150m on 23 May 2018 and at an altitude of 50m on 5 September 2018, delta values of 50.1% above). After the onset of turbulent mixing, the isotopic composition was the same throughout the vertical column with a mean delta value of 49.9 +/- 0.45 %. The systematically more negative delta values occurred only as long as the nocturnal temperature inversion was present. During the September study, water samples were analysed as well for methane concentration and isotopic composition in order to provide a link between surface and atmosphere. The water samples reveal high variability on horizontal scales of a few tens of metres for this particular case. The airborne sampling system and consecutive analysis chain were shown to provide reliable and reproducible results for two samples obtained simultaneously. The method presents a powerful tool for distinguishing the source process of methane at different altitudes. The isotopic composition showed clearly depleted delta values directly above a biological methane source when vertical mixing was hampered by a temperature inversion, and different delta values above, where the air masses originate from a different footprint area. The vertical distribution of methane isotopic composition can serve as tracer for mixing processes of methane within the atmospheric boundary layer.

AB Surface water and peat in the northern Everglades have very low natural concentrations of U and are therefore sensitive to the addition of small amounts of U from anthropogenic sources such as fertilizer. Feat samples collected along a nutrient gradient in the northern Everglades have unusually high concentrations of U (> 1 mu g/g, dry basis) and also have a distinctive U-234/U-238 activity ratio (AR). AR values for U-enriched pear fall in the narrow range of AR values for commercial phosphate fertilizer (1.00 +/- 0.05). In contrast,AR values for low-U peal from background sites exceed 1.05. The spatial distribution of anomalous U concentration, and of fertilizer-like AR values in peat, parallel a previously documented pattern of P enrichment. These results strongly suggest that some of the U in nutrient-impacted peatlands is fertilizer-derived. Agricultural drainage water sampled in the northern Everglades has high concentrations of dissolved U (0.3-2.4 mu g/l) compared to surface water from background sites (<0.1 mu g/l). Measured AR values in drainage water (0.949-0.990) are also permissive of a fertilizer origin for the U and are different from AR values in surface water or peat at background sites (AR > 1.05). Synoptic sampling of surface water along drainage canals indicate that Lake Okeechobee, and some drainage from agricultural fields, are sources of dissolved U, whereas wetlands farther downstream act as sinks for U, Historically cultivated agricultural soil has only a marginally elevated (+ 0.2 mu g/g) average concentration of U compared to nearby uncultivated soil and incorporates only 20% of the U from an aqueous solution that was slurried with the soil. In contrast, a Similar experiment with fresh Everglades pear indicated uptake of 90% of the added U, These experiments support the proposed removal of U from agricultural fields and concentration of U in downstream peatlands. The methodology of this study can be used to describe the behavior of fertilizer-derived U in other low-U environments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.

AB 1. We assessed the terrestrial export of organic carbon, which effectively supported aquatic bacterial production (BP), from small boreal catchments during spring flood. We analysed stream runoff from nine small catchments with different proportions of peat mires and coniferous forests by monitoring the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux in combination with conducting bacterial bioassays.
   2. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that BP during 7-day-dark bioassays (BP7; mu g C L(-1)day(-1)) was explained by both the quantity and quality (low-molecular weight fractions) of the DOC. BP7 can be used as a measure of export of terrestrial organic carbon that is highly bioavailable.
   3. Total export of DOC during spring flood from the different catchments ranged from 20 to 27 kg ha(-1) and was negatively correlated to forest cover (%). However, the export of BP7 carbon was positively correlated to forest cover and varied from about 0.1 kg ha(-1) in mire-dominated streams to about 0.2 kg ha(-1) in forest-dominated streams.
   4. The high bioavailability of forest carbon suggests that forests are the main contributors of BP-supporting carbon in boreal streams although mires have higher area-specific export of DOC.

AB Sixteen boreal lakes in northern Alberta were sampled for a suite of water chemistry parameters, including dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2), using a headspace gas analysis technique. The lakes encompassed a wide range of pH and alkalinity but had very high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels (11-36 mg L-1) and were supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. While the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) is regularly estimated from pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH was related to pCO(2) at only 13 of 16 lakes and overall pH in combination with DIC was a poor predictor of pCO(2). Similarly, despite very high DOC levels, pCO(2) was unrelated to the DOC concentration of the lakes. Stepwise multiple linear regressions improved the prediction capability for the entire data set, when compared to simple regressions. Both physicochemical (alkalinity, temperature) and landscape descriptors (lake area, peatland relative area) were important predictors of pCO(2). The best regression model included lake area, peatland relative area, and water temperature, and was better able to predict pCO(2) than relationships based on DOC, and pH and alkalinity, but lakes with high pCO(2) (> 1000 mu atm) remain under-predicted and are likely subject to additional factors controlling pCO(2) that were not considered in this analysis.

AB There is a limited understanding of the distribution and transport of solutes in the coastal forest-peatland systems of northern British Columbia, Canada. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the sources, concentration and flux of major ions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil-groundwater system of a forest-peatland complex in the coastal western hemlock (CWH) forest zone. DOC dominated the groundwater flux, with most of it exported during high flow conditions. Inorganic ion concentration increased and DOC decreased with ground surface slope and community type from open peatland to bog woodland, bog forest, swamp forest and upland forest. Base cations, HCO3- and DOC in the peatland forest communities differed significantly (P < 0.05) from concentrations in the upland forest. The greatest concentrations of ions derived from mineral weathering were found in the upland forest where the absence of peat, deep mineral soil (85-465 cm) and steep surface slope (26%) combined to increase dissolution by recharging groundwater. NO3-, SO42- and PO43- were at or below detection limits. Concentrations of DOC, metals and HCO3- decreased from summer to spring with dilution by rainfall and decreasing decomposition. In addition to providing novel data in a data-sparse region, this study provides an analysis of the processes controlling runoff production and the transport and transformation of biogeochemical elements impacting stream water quality.

AB Stream-and soilwater at the 18.7 ha pristine Ingabekken catchment, on gneiss bedrock at Hoylandet, have been studied for three years, including intensive episode studies in spring and autumn. The site mainly consists of blanket bogs which are typical for these marine west coast climates. Water drains through the blanket peats by means of two major flowpaths. Each flowpath contributes to the stream with a distinct chemical fingerprint rendered by the soil/soil water interactions along the flowpath, i.e. they may be regarded as end-members. The soil water from the upper peat layers is the end-member representative of stormflow discharge whereas baseflow originates mainly from seepage of the other end-member, which is the mineral soil water from beneath the peat. The pH(BaCl2) of the soils that control the runoff chemistry during highflow conditions was as low as 2.6, allowing for a substantial pH drop in streamwater in the case of a seasalt episode. pH in the stream varied from more than 7 at baseflow to 5 or slightly below at stormflow. The lowest pH (4.8) was observed during early snowmelt due to release of meltwater highly enriched in seasalts. The fraction of exchangeable aluminum (AIS) was much higher in the surface layers of the lower reaches of the catchment than close to the water divide. This suggests a transport of Al, much like podzolisation, though downslope by a lateral flowpath. A Principal Component Analysis on the stream water chemical data shows the importance of water flowpaths in addition to dilution or ionic strength and antecedent conditions as a factor in determining the water quality. On the plane of the two major principal components the base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) were negatively related to [H+], and the total organic carbon (TOC) was negatively related to strong acid anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-). These relationships between the parameter loadings along the two main principal components remained indifferent to the effects of both dilution and flowpaths.
   Under the present conditions of low acid deposition, this sensitive system is effectively buffered by its weak acids and all released Al is complexed by natural organic acids. Similar boggy areas located in regions with heavy anthropogenic acid deposition may not be able to neutralize the mineral acids. A shallow water flowpath and a high H+ saturation of the ion exchanger in the soils controlling the highflow chemistry may lead to discharge episodes where strong mineral acids are allowed to pass through the system releasing elevated levels of toxic aluminum in the stream.

AB Increased ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation arising from stratospheric ozone depletion may influence soil microbial communities via effects on plant carbon allocation and root exudation.
   Eriophorum angustifolium and Narthecium ossifragum plants, grown in peatland mesocosms consisting of Sphagnum peat, peat pore water and natural microbial communities, were exposed outdoors to enhanced UV-B radiation simulating 15% ozone depletion in southern Scandinavia for 8 wk.
   Enhanced UV-B increased rhizome biomass and tended to decrease the biomass of the largest root fraction of N. ossifragum and furthermore decreased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and monocarboxylic acid concentration, which serves as an estimate of net root exudation, in the pore water of the N. ossifragum mesocosms. Monocarboxylic acid concentration was negatively related to the total carbon concentration of N. ossifragum leaves, which was increased by enhanced UV-B. By contrast, enhanced UV-B tended to increase monocarboxylic acid concentration in the rhizosphere of E. angustifolium and its root : shoot ratio. Microbial biomass carbon was increased by enhanced UV-B in the surface water of the E. angustifolium mesocosms.
   Increased UV-B radiation appears to alter below-ground biomass of the mire plants in species-specific patterns, which in turn leads to a change in the net efflux of root exudates.

AB Permafrost peatland plays an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the most important components to C budgets in this system. Through the Chinese-United States EcoPartnership program, Dr Xianwei Wang, Li Sun, and Prof Changchun Song et al. from the Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof Aixin Hou from the Louisiana State University observed dynamics of DOC concentrations and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) obtained from soil porewater of permafrost peatlands for two growing seasons in the Great Hing'an Mountains, Northeast China. Soil porewater DOC concentrations varied greatly with depths during the growing season, ranging between 22.08 and 65.02 mg L-1. There was no significant relationship between DOC concentrations and SUVA(254). DOC concentrations were higher in autumn and increased as the seasonal thaw depth increased. DOC concentrations of supra-permafrost water at freeze-thaw boundary were also higher than those at the other soil depths. Temperature and thawing depth had been shown to affect DOC concentrations at different soil depths. Our finding suggests that warming and deepening of the active layer likely increase the DOC productions in the permafrost peatland, which may influence the C balance in these C-enriched ecosystems.

AB Peatlands are recognized as important carbon stores; despite this, many have been drained for agricultural improvement. Drainage has been shown to lower water tables and alter vegetation composition, modifying primary productivity and decomposition, potentially initiating peat loss. To quantify CO2 fluxes across whole landscapes, it is vital to understand how vegetation composition and CO2 fluxes vary spatially in response to the pattern of drainage features. However, Molinia caerulea-dominated peatlands are poorly understood despite their widespread extent.
   Photosynthesis (P-G600) and ecosystem respiration (R-Eco) were modelled (12 degrees C, 600 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), greenness excess index of 60) using empirically derived parameters based on closed-chamber measurements collected over a growing season. Partitioned below-ground fluxes were also collected. Plots were arranged 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 the distance between adjacent ditches in two catchments located in Exmoor National Park, southwest England.
   Water table depths were deepest closest to the ditch and non-significantly (p = 0.197) shallower further away. Non-Molinia species coverage and the Simpson diversity index significantly decreased with water table depth (p < 0.024) and increased non-significantly (p < 0.083) away from the ditch. No CO2 fluxes showed significant spatial distribution in response to drainage ditches, arguably due to insignificant spatial distribution of water tables and vegetation composition. Whilst R-Eco showed no significant spatial variation, P-G600 varied significantly between sites (p = 0.012), thereby controlling the spatial distribution of net ecosystem exchange between sites. As P-G600 significantly co-varied with water table depths (p = 0.034), determining the spatial distribution of water table depths may enable CO2 fluxes to be estimated across M. caerulea-dominated landscapes.

AB Viruses impact microbial activity and carbon cycling in various environments, but their diversity and ecological importance in Sphagnum-peatlands are unknown. Abundances of viral particles and prokaryotes were monitored bi-monthly at a fen and a bog at two different layers of the peat surface. Viral particle abundance ranged from 1.7 x 10(6) to 5.6 x 10(8) particles mL(-1), and did not differ between fen and bog but showed seasonal fluctuations. These fluctuations were positively correlated with prokaryote abundance and dissolved organic carbon, and negatively correlated with water-table height and dissolved oxygen. Using shotgun metagenomics we observed a shift in viral diversity between winter/spring and summer/autumn, indicating a seasonal succession of viral communities, mainly driven by weather-related environmental changes. Based on the seasonal asynchrony between viral and microbial diversity, we hypothesize a seasonal shift in the active microbial communities associated with a shift from lysogenic to lytic lifestyles. Our results suggest that temporal variations of environmental conditions rather than current habitat differences control the dynamics of virus-host interactions in Sphagnum dominated peatlands.

AB Eutrophication and the formation of phytoplankton blooms in freshwaters can be detrimental to water quality and biological health and produce organic matter that can be difficult to remove during water treatment processes. With the frequency of phytoplankton blooms increasing, remediation solutions are becoming increasingly popular. This study investigated the use of a peat-based floating treatment wetland (FTW) for reducing phytoplankton growth in eutrophic waters. Over a four-week period, the FTWs were able to reduce chlorophyll a concentrations by 80%, through sequestration of nitrate and phosphate and possibly due to the direct inhibitory properties of phenolic compounds. Although there are concerns about the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the FTWs, this may be more than offset by the beneficial suppression of phytoplankton growth and the resulting reduced input of `untreatable' low molecular weight DOC.

DT Article
DE Phosphorus; potassium; needle analysis; stand growth; nutrient
   deficiency; nitrogen-rich peat; fertilization
AB While fens dominated by Purple Moor Grass (Molinia caerulea (L.) Moench) have generally been considered unsuitable for forest drainage due to their low content of mineral nutrients, the fact that they also are rich in nitrogen has been acknowledged to offer silvicultural possibilities. This study examined the nutrient status and growth of Scots pine stands (with downy birch as a secondary species) on two drainage and fertilization experiments. Both of the sites were nitrogen-rich and originally scarcely wooded or treeless fens. Nokkapuronsuo (64 degrees 34' N, 28 degrees 23' E) was drained in the 1950s and fertilized in 1962, 1980 and 2002. Hanhiselka (64 degrees 53' N, 26 degrees 04' E) was drained in 1967 and fertilized in 1980. Disintegrated phosphate, potassium chloride, PK-fertilizer for peatlands and wood ash were used to fertilize the sites. The data included monitoring the foliar nutrient concentrations and post-fertilization stand volume growth during the 27-44 years from fertilizer application.
   The needle analyses of Scots pine revealed a severe deficiency of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the unfertilized control trees. Fertilization treatments of P (36-133 kg ha(-1)) and K (66-361 kg ha(-1)) improved the respective nutrient concentrations above the deficiency limits. The effect of single P addition was more pronounced and prolonged than that of K addition. In general, the more K included in the single or repeated fertilization treatment, the greater was the growth of trees during the study period.
   At both sites, the stand growth of unfertilized trees remained low (less than 0.5 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1)). Fertilization increased both stand density and the volume growth of the single trees. On the fertilized plots tree growth remained at considerably higher levels than the control throughout the whole study period. At Nokkapuronsuo the highest yields varied between 3 and 4 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1) during the 44 years and at Hanhiselka between 5 and 6 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1) during the 27 years. In conclusion, refertilizing during the stand rotation, once with phosphorus and twice with potassium, is needed to ensure the continued good nutrient status of trees on Molinia fens.

AB This study describes the analysis of fluvial carbon flux from an upland peat catchment in the North Pennines. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, alkalinity and calcium were measured in weekly samples, with particulate organic carbon (POC) measured from the suspended sediment load from the stream outlet of an 11.4-km(2) catchment. For calendar year 1999, regular monitoring of the catchment was supplemented with detailed quasi-continuous measurements of flow and stream temperature, and DOC for the months September through November. The measurements were used to calculate the annual flux of dissolved CO,, dissolved inorganic carbon, DOC and POC from the catchment and were combined with CO, and CH, gaseous exchanges calculated from previously published values and the observations of water table height within the peat. The study catchment represents a net sink of 15.4+/-11.9 gC/m(2)/yr. Carbon flows calculated for the study catchment are combined with values in the literature, using a Monte Carlo method, to estimate the carbon budget for British upland peat. For all British upland peat the calculation suggests a net carbon sink of between 0.15 and 0.29 MtC/yr. This is the first study to include a comprehensive study of the fluvial export of carbon within carbon budgets and shows the size of the peat carbon sink to be smaller than previous estimates, although sensitivity analysis shows that the primary productivity rather than fluvial carbon flux is a more important element in estimating the carbon budget in this regard.

AB Large areas of peatlands have worldwide been drained to facilitate agriculture, which has adverse effects on the environment and the global climate. Agriculture on rewetted peatlands (paludiculture) provides a sustainable alternative to drainage-based agriculture. One form of paludiculture is the cultivation of Sphagnum moss, which can be used as a raw material for horticultural growing media. Under natural conditions, most Sphagnum mosses eligible for paludiculture typically predominate only in nutrient-poor wetland habitats. It is unknown, however, how the prevailing high nutrient levels in rewetted agricultural peatlands interfere with optimal Sphagnum production.
   We therefore studied the effect of enriched nutrient conditions remaining even after top soil removal and further caused by external supply of nutrient-rich irrigation water and (generally) high inputs of atmospheric nitrogen (N) to habitat biogeochemistry, biomass production and nutrient stoichiometry of introduced Sphagnum palustre and S. papillosum in a rewetted peatland, which was formerly in intensive agricultural use.
   Airborne N was responsible for the major supply of N. Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were mainly supplied by irrigation water. The prevailing high nutrient levels (P and K) are a result of nutrient-rich irrigation water from the surroundings. Peat porewater (10 cm below peatmoss surface) CO2 concentrations were high, bicarbonate concentrations low, and the pH was around 4.2.
   Provided that moisture supply is sufficient and dominance of fast-growing, larger graminoids suppressed (in order to avoid outshading of Sphagnum mosses), strikingly very high biomass yields of 6.7 and 6.5 t DW ha(-1) yr(-1) (S, palustre and S. papillosum [including S. fallax biomass], respectively) were obtained despite high N supply and biomass N concentrations. Despite high P and K supply and uptake, N:P and N:K ratios in the Sphagnum capitula were still low. Sphagnum mosses achieved high nutrient sequestration rates of 34 kg N, 17 kg K and 4 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) from May 2013 to May 2014, which shows that the site acted as an active nutrient sink. Nutrient management still needs further improvement to reduce the competitive advantage of fast growing peatmoss species (cf. S. fallax) at the expense of slower growing but preferred peatmosses as horticultural substrate (S. palustre and S. papillosum) to optimize the quality of biomass yields.
   In conclusion, Sphagnum farming is well able to thrive under high N input provided that there is a simultaneous high input of P and K from irrigation water, which facilitates high production rates. Due to the lack of suitable, nutrient poor sites, it seems to be useful to remove the topsoil (mainly P removal) prior to start growing Sphagnum mosses. In addition, bicarbonate concentrations have to stay sufficientlylow to ensure a low pH, CO2 supply from the peat soil should be sufficiently high to prevent C limitation, and graminoids should be mown regularly.

AB Forest drains and streams on blanket peatland in western Ireland were sampled weekly, 1996-2000, using continuous, depth-proportional passive sampling, and analysed for molybdate-reactive phosphorus (MRP) by the acid-antimony-molybdate method. The study area was largely clearfelled and partly reforested with wind-rowing, drainage, planting, and aerially applied rock phosphate equivalent to 70 kg P/ha. Further felled areas were not wind-rowed, drained or fertilised for reforestation. Catchment areas were of the following orders: 1 ha (two forest drains); 10-20 ha (two semi-permanent drains, one permanent stream); 1-3 km(2) (three permanent streams). Streamwater from three undisturbed closed-canopy-forest catchments had pre-felling median concentrations of MRP (all values are mug MRP l(-1)) of 9 (catchment approximately 1 km(2)), 13 (1 ha) and 93 (1 ha). Clearfelling was associated with large increases (maxima 305, 4164 and 3530 mug MRP l(-1)) in MRP concentrations in each case. Following protracted mechanical operations in four other catchments of ca. 1 km(2), 20, 10 and 10 ha, with apparently existing elevated MRP concentrations (medians 41, 328, 102, 214 mug MRP l(-1)) fertilising gave major rises (maxima 218, 2723, 806,2323 mug MRP l(-1)). The three smaller catchments showed subsequent exponential-type declines, while the 1 km(2) catchment had sustained high values (median 74 mug MRP l(-1)) over the remaining study period. The higher values in this one larger stream were seasonally cyclical, with a late summer maximum. Annual median MRP values above 70 mug l(-1) represent a seriously polluted state for these streams, which qualify as waterways under relevant statutes, but it is not clear what implications these results have for downstream river-water quality in larger channels.

AB This paper provides information on the impact of recent climate change on carbon sequestration in peatland systems in South West England. This is important because peatlands have the potential to sequester and hold large quantities of ant hropogenically released CO2. This paper investigates whether there has been a reduction in the strength of carbon sinks in a valley mire and blanket bog, which occur on the limits of the biogeographical envelop for peallands in Britain. Past rates of carbon accumulation were calculated from peat depth and the sequential analysis of peat age, bulk density and carbon content from cores taken from valley mire and blanket bog. At the valley mire site contemporary net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was calculated by measuring inputs to the peat body, via net primary productivity (NPP), of Sphagna. Losses of C from the peat body were calculated by measuring CH4, and aquatic carbon, calculated from catchment export of particulate and dissolved organic carbon. The study found similar mean rates of carbon accumulation since 1850 of 11.26 t +/- 0.68 t CO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) (307 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in valley mire and 11.77 t +/- 0.88 t CO(2)e ha(-1)yr(-1) (321 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in blanket bog. The mean present-day CO2 sequestration rate for Sphagna on valley mire was calculated to be 9.13 t +/- 0.98 t CO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) (249 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Both past and contemporary rates of CO2 sequestration were found to be at the maxima of those reported for temperate peatlands. NPP was found to vary according to microform with higher rates of carbon sequestration found in lawn and hummock microforms compared with pools. Our work suggests that recent changes in the climate appear to have had limited impact on the strength of peatland carbon sinks in South West England. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A conceptual framework for runoff generation in a permafrost environment

DT Article
DE hillslope runoff; stream flow; arctic; tundra; peat
AB Hillslope runoff processes were studied in the tundra region of the Canadian western arctic in order to provide a physically-based, conceptual framework for runoff generation for basins in this environment. It was found that subsurface flow is the dominant mechanism of runoff to the stream channel, that this flow is conveyed predominantly through the peat of the inter-hummock channels, and that subsurface flow through the highly conductive upper peat layer and soil pipes can be as rapid as surface flow. Stream discharge was computed from computations of hillslope runoff and meltwater input from the snowpack in the stream channel. The similarity between the computed and measured stream discharge suggests that the approach used to compute discharge would be useful as a conceptual basis for a distributed hydrological model for this environment. Hydrological interaction among the basin subsystems was found to play an important role in runoff generation. For example, when the water table was in the highly conductive upper peat layer, and discharge from inter-hummock channels was relatively large (similar to 0.1-1.0 m(3) d(-1)), the near-stream area, a zone of relatively thick peat, offered little attenuation to water draining toward the stream channel, and the source area for stream flow was relatively large. The duration of this high flow regime Varied among hillsides due to variations in the width of the near-stream area, the gradient, length and inclination of hillslopes, and the water equivalent and melt rate of the snowpack. When the water table subsided into the lower peat layer, and discharge from inter-hummock channels decreased (<0.1 m(3) d(-1)), the runoff source area was relatively small. Under this condition, if drainage into the near-stream area increased, the lateral expansion of the runoff source area would be delayed due to the relatively large storage capacity near the stream.

AB This study estimates the complete carbon budget of an 11.4 km(2) peat-covered catchment in Northern England. The budget considers both fluvial and gaseous carbon fluxes and includes estimates of particulate organic carbon (POC); dissolved organic carbon (DOC); excess dissolved CO2: release of methane (CH4): net ecosystem respiration of CO2: and uptake of CO2 by primary productivity. All components except CH4 were measured directly in the catchment and annual carbon budgets were calculated for the catchment between 1993 and 2005 using both extrapolation and interpolation methods. The study shows that: Over the 13 year study period the total carbon balance varied between a net sink of -20 to -91 Mg C/km(2)/yr. The biggest component of this budget is the uptake of carbon by primary productivity (-178 Mg C/km(2)/yr) and in most years the second largest component is the loss of DOC from the peat profile (+39 Mg C/km(2)/yr). Direct exchanges of C with the atmosphere average -89 Mg C/km(2)/yr in the catchment. Extrapolating the general findings of the carbon budget across all UK peatlands results in an approximate carbon balance of -1.2 Tg C/yr (+/-0.4 Pg C/yr) which is larger than previously reported values. Carbon budgets should always be reported with a clear statement of the techniques used and errors involved as this is significant when comparing results across studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The transport of Th, Ra, and Pb-210 from a continental source region and through an estuarine environment was investigated. Unlike previous studies, here both short- and long-lived nuclide data were obtained for river inputs, river water, and estuarine waters. The mire-rich Kalix River drainage basin was chosen as a typical northern shield area because this river may represent typical waters flowing into the Arctic and northern seas.
   Groundwaters from bedrock and glacial tills have comparable Th isotope concentrations and do not exhibit significant Th isotopic shifts relative to host rocks. The extensive peat deposits of the basin receive groundwater discharges and concentrate Th and U (but not Ba and Ra), which cause high Th-230/Th-232 ratios in mire waters. However, mire outflows do not have a significant impact on Th and Ra isotopic compositions of the river.
   Overall weathering characteristics for the basin are obtained from the river data. The Th-230/Th-232, Ra-228/Ra-226, and Ra-226/Ba river ratios are comparable to those of source rocks, consistent with similar release rates of these nuclides from U-, Th-, and Ba-bearing minerals. River ratios of (Th-230/U-238)(AR) and (Ra-226/U-238)(AR) are <1, so that Th and possibly Ra are accumulating in the weathering regions, and the weathering profile is still evolving. Low (Ra-228/Th-232)(AR) and (Ra-226/Th-230)(AR) ratios indicate that Th is preferentially retained over Ra. River (Th-234/U-238)(AR) ratios are greater than (Th-230/U-238)(AR) ratios and suggest that in systems where river inputs are well characterized, these ratios can be used to calculate Th transit times through the watershed. Filtration data indicate that although a dominant fraction of the Th is transported in the river on particles, the rest is almost entirely carried by colloids.
   The Kalix River discharges into the Baltic Sea. Model calculations for the transport of Th and Ra isotopes in the Baltic Sea show that the high ratios of (Th-234/U-238)(AR) found here reflect long Th residence times relative to particle scavenging of similar to 50 d. The water column Th-232 budget is dominated by eolian inputs. The Ra-226 concentrations may be higher than those of water inflows, with less than or equal to 60% derived from underlying sediments. A greater fraction of Ra-228 is derived from sediments to balance the decay of Ra-228 within the water column during the 35-yr residence time of water in the Baltic. The Baltic (Ra-228/Ra-226)(AR) ratios, which are relatively constant over a range of salinities, are fortuitously similar to those of the river inflows. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A unique complex of multiphased Holocene drift sands and paleosols, with at least two lacustrine phases, was discovered during a major sanitation project in the Laarder Wasmeren area near Hilversum, the Netherlands. The complex could be studied in detail, highly facilitated by the excellent and large-scale exposure of the various deposits and soils. OSL dating was used to establish ages of the phases, where possible differentiating between time of deposition and time of burial by taking into account the potential effects of bioturbation. Pollen analysis served to reconstruct the vegetation during the various phases.
   A first minor phase of aeolian activity already started before approx. 5,000 BC, followed around 4,000 BC by a second phase and a rather massive third phase around 3,000 BC. After a long phase of soil formation, the latest, massive drift sand phase started around the 14th to 15th century. It clearly represents the classic drift sand phase that started in the Late Middle Ages in the Netherlands. Sand drifting followed on soil forming phases during which the vegetation became increasingly dominated by ericaceous plants and culminated in heathlands. The first three aeolian phases and associated heathlands are much older than generally assumed for heathland and drift sand to occur in the Netherlands. Moreover, podzolisation was found to have started very early, true podzols already occurring before 4,000 BC.
   Around 3,000 BC groundwater in the area reached a maximum altitude of about 230 cm +NAP, resulting in local open water in the area. This rise is probably linked to the development of the Dutch coastal area, where at that time peat accumulated and drainage was poor, inducing a rise of the groundwater level in 'het Gooi'. This groundwater level fell later on, to never reach this altitude again. The Groot Wasmeer was formed by local stagnation on a slowly permeable podzol and already reached a level of 320-325 cm +NAP by 400 BC, which more or less equals its 20th century level.
   The results demonstrate that earlier concepts on the occurrence and age of aeolian phases, podzols and heathland vegetations in the Netherlands are far too schematic, and that early, pre-agricultural cultures may already have had an impact on the stability of fragile cover sand landscapes, e.g. through burning. Results are in line with those from several contemporary studies on early prehistoric cultures and their impact in river dune areas in the Central and Eastern Netherlands.

AB Reductions in the global stratospheric ozone layer are thought to be increasing the amount of ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation reaching the planet's surface and may be affecting the chemistry of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) in surface waters. We studied the abundance of chromophores in DOC collected in four different aquatic environments in southwestern Nova Scotia using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) spectroscopy. We showed a clear seasonal pattern in the distribution of structural carbon related to light-sensitive chromophores. There seemed to be little variation in the UV-B related chemical structure of DOC between lakes and streams, though water from a bog pool showed large differences from the other samples. These patterns of potential UV-B reactivity tend to be dampened however, by variations in DOC concentrations which also occur seasonally.

AB On 19 September 2003, 40 landslides of 140-18 000 m(3) volume occurred within 2 center dot 5 km(2) on the slopes of Dooncarton Mountain (Republic of Ireland) during a storm that may have exceeded 90 mm within 90 minutes. The landslides were investigated to determine the reasons for such a high density of slope failures. All of the landslides were surveyed within four months; and nine of them were investigated in detail. The six largest landslides, all peat failures, accounted for 57% of the more than 100 000 m(3) of material displaced during the event. A consistent sequence of superficial materials was found on the failed hillslopes, including an extensive iron pan at the base of a buried soil horizon 0 center dot 3 m below the base of the peat. Morphologically, almost all of the landslides occurred on steep planar slopes or around sharp convexities, with the latter failures developing retrogressively upslope. The only significant relationship found from analysis of 371 subsurface pipes and 142 seepage cracks (defined here as contiguous fissures conducting concentrated subsurface flow) across all the failures was that the thinner the peat cover, the deeper the pipes and seepage cracks occurred below the base of peat. It is concluded that most of the landslides were probably caused by a combination of excess water pressures in the buried soil horizon and the thinner overburden of peat or peaty soil associated with the steeper slope segments. Pipes and seepage cracks formed on the iron pan probably existed prior to the failure event and may have contributed to the high water pressures as rainwater inputs exceeded their discharge capacities. One large peat slide was probably triggered by excess water pressures developed within and between artificial tine cuts. The properties of the blanket peat were generally of little consequence in the occurrence of the landslides, but relict desiccation cracks and other structural weaknesses through the peat mass were probably highly significant. Although several aspects of the peat failures correspond to previously published examples, the context of these failures in terms of the topography and upland catena is distinctive.

AB The chemical components in water, and changes thereof, can control the ecology of peatlands and impact the accumulation of peat; while at the same time ecological characteristics, hydrology and interactions with the atmosphere and geosphere control peatland water chemistry. This review summarizes results from Canadian and northern European research published over the past two decades for major and minor, inorganic and organic constituents dissolved in surface or pore waters associated with bogs and fens. First those studies that describe natural peatlands are discussed, followed by those that involve peatlands that are disturbed by various direct or indirect anthropogenic influences. Finally several recommendations are made regarding future studies and how they can assist in modelling efforts that can inform peatland management and further scientific inquiry.

AB Question: In fen meadows with Junco-Molinion plant communities, falling groundwater levels may not lead to a boosted above-ground biomass production if limitation of nutrients persists. Instead, depending on drainage intensity and microtopography, acidification may trigger a shift into drier and more nutrient-poor plant communities.
   Location: Nature reserve, central Netherlands, 5 m a.s.l.
   Methods: Long-term study (1988-1997) in a fen meadow along a gradient in drainage intensity at different scales.
   Results: Above-ground biomass increased only slightly over ten years, despite a lower summer groundwater table. The accountable factors were probably a limited availability of nutrients (K in the higher well-drained plots, P in the intermediate plots and N in the lower hardly drained plots), plus removal of hay.
   Junco-Molinion species increased in dry sites and Parvocaricetea species increased in wet sites, presumably primarily because of soil acidification occurring when rainwater becomes more influential than base-rich groundwater. The extent of the shift in species composition depends primarily on the drainage intensity and secondarily on microtopography. Local hydrological measures have largely failed to restore wetter and more basic-rich conditions.
   Conclusions: Acidification and nutrient removal, leaching and immobilization resulted in the succession towards Junco-Molinion at the cost of Calthion palustris elements. Lower in the gradient this change was reduced by the presence of buffered groundwater in slightly drained sites. To conserve the typical plant communities of the Junco-Molinion to Calthion gradient in the long term, further acidification must be prevented, for example by inundation with base-rich surface water.

AB Large amounts of carbon are stored in northern peatlands. There is concern that greater wildfire severity following projected increases in summer drought will lead to higher post-fire carbon losses. We measured soil carbon dynamics in a Calluna heathland and a raised peat bog after experimentally manipulating fire severity. A gradient of fire severity was achieved by simulating drought in 2 x 2 m plots. Ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), methane (CH4) flux and concentration of dissolved organic carbon ( [DOC], measured at the raised bog only) were measured for up to two years after burning. The response of these carbon fluxes to increased fire severity in drought plots was similar to plots burnt under ambient conditions associated with traditional managed burning. Averaged across all burnt plots, burning altered mean NEE from a net carbon sink at the heathland ( - 0.33 mu mol CO2 m(-2) S-1 in unburnt plots) to a carbon source (0.50 mu mol m(-2) S-1 in burnt plots) and at the raised bog ( - 0.38 and 0.16 mu mol m(-2) S-1, respectively). Burning also increased CH4 flux at the raised bog (from 1.16 to 25.3 nmol m(-2) S-1 in the summer, when it accounted for 79% of the CO2-equivalent emission). Burning had no significant effect on soil water [DOC].

AB The changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), N-NO3, N-NH4 and P-PO4 concentrations in response to fluctuations in the groundwater table were investigated in the peatlands of Biebrza National Park and some of its surrounding sites. The lowering of the groundwater table during summer time was accompanied by an increase in P-PO4 and N-NH4 concentrations, and in some cases they were exceptionally high compared with undisturbed water. Concentrations of both nutrients correlated with groundwater levels. Decreasing the groundwater level promoted higher concentrations of both nutrients. Nevertheless, elevated concentrations of P-PO4 and N-NH4 occurred in groundwater during the summer months when the outflow of water from peatland was slow. The N-NO3 and DOC concentrations did not change markedly with the lowering of groundwater table or during different seasons.

AB [1] To examine belowground carbon (C) turnover in peatlands, we measured fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane (CH(4)) by chamber measurements, estimated respiration by in situ incubations of peat, and in situ production of dissolved carbon (CO(2); CH(4); and dissolved organic carbon, DOC) by pore water modeling at an ombrotrophic temperate bog. Ecosystem respiration (ER) averaged 205 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in summer and was related to temperature, but not water table position, and in situ rates of heterotrophic respiration in the unsaturated zone were also temperature-dependent, with Q(10) = 5.0 - 6.4. In the saturated zone, concentrations of 0.1 - 2.5 mmol L(-1) (CO(2)), 0 to 0.6 mmol L(-1) (CH(4)), and < 10 - 120 mg L(-1) (DOC) were recorded. Turnover was dominated by DOC unrelated to respiration, which ranged from < 0.5 to 7 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and amounted on average to < 1% of ER. Peat decomposition constants k(d) were 0.060 yr(-1) to 0.034 yr(-1) in the unsaturated and < 0.002 yr(-1) in the saturated zone. Monthly averages of CH(4) fluxes ranged from 0 to 1.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and were higher than modeled diffusive fluxes when threshold concentrations for CH(4) ebullition were recorded closer to the peatland surface. Our results suggest that the saturated zone is of little relevance to ER in this dry temperate bog and that mobilization of DOC is a potentially more relevant process. Temperature is a more important control on ER than water table position because most of the ER is generated close to the peatland surface. Concurrent, moderate increases in temperature and soil moisture are thus likely to increase losses of CO(2) from ER and of CH(4) from this type of peatland.

AB Biogeochemical processes in northern peatland ecosystems are influenced by seasonal temperature fluctuations that are changing with the climate. Methylmercury (MeHg), commonly produced in peatlands, affects downstream waters; therefore, it is important to understand how temperature transitions affect mercury (Hg) dynamics. We investigated how the freeze-thaw cycle influences belowground peat pore water total Hg (THg), MeHg, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Four large, intact peat columns were removed from an ombrotrophic peat bog and experimentally frozen and thawed. Pore water was sampled across seven depths in the peat columns during the freeze-thaw cycle and analyzed for THg, MeHg, and DOC concentrations. Freezing results showed increased concentrations of THg below the ice layers and limited change in MeHg concentrations. During thawing, THg concentrations significantly increased, whereas MeHg concentrations decreased. Limited bromide movement and depth decreases in THg and DOC concentrations were associated with increased bulk density and degree of humification in the peat. The experiment demonstrates the effects of the freeze-thaw cycle on Hg concentrations in northern peatlands. Changes to freeze-thaw cycles with climate change may exacerbate Hg cycling and transport processes in peatland environments.

AB Comprehensive and credible peatland carbon budgets, needed for global carbon accounting, must include lateral aquatic organic carbon export. Here, we quantify aquatic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export for an Atlantic bog in subarctic Norway, the Andoya peatland, and test for sensitivity to climatic drivers. Hydrology, DOC concentrations and DOC export were simulated for 2000-2013 using the process-based catchment model Integrated Catchments model for Carbon (INCA-C), calibrated to site-specific water chemistry and hydrology (2011-2014) using readily-available data on temperature, precipitation and seasalt deposition. Measured streamwater DOC declined under seasalt episodes and was strongly positively related to temperature. Model calibrations successfully reproduced the water balance, variation in runoff (R-2 = 0.67; Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency NS = 0.67) and DOC concentrations (R-2 = 0.85; NS = 0.84). The most sensitive model parameters related to temperature-sensitivity of DOC production and DOC (de)sorption sensitivity to seasalts. Model uncertainty related to parameter space was similar to interannual variation in DOC export. Mean annual modelled DOC export was 7.2 +/- A 0.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), roughly 35 % of the net land-atmospheric CO2 exchange at Andoya from 2009 to 2012 (estimated elsewhere). Current and antecedent mean temperature and precipitation were strong drivers of seasonal modelled DOC export, implying that warmer and wetter summers will lead to more DOC export. Evaluation of similar climate impacts on net peatland carbon accumulation requires additional exploration of the climate-sensitivity of land-atmosphere fluxes of CO2 and methane. Process-based models are valuable tools to account for lateral DOC exports in carbon balances of northern peatlands, especially where long-term monitoring data are lacking.

AB This study aimed to reconstruct the history of soil development, ecosystem changes and associated erosional processes in a small mountain lacustrine basin at the decennial to millennial scale. Geochemical proxies of soil evolution were analysed in the Holocene lacustrine sediments and peats from Thyl Lake, Maurienne Valley, French Alps. Podzolization and chemical weathering processes were assessed using secondary Al- and Fe-bearing phases together with major and Rare Earth Elements (REE). The resulting proxy records, spanning ca. 4,400 years between 8.6 and 4.2 cal ka BP, indicate that progressive pedogenesis occurred after deglaciation in a relatively stable subalpine ecosystem. As shown by the associated increase in Al- and Fe-bearing phases and some REE fractions, the establishment of a mixed cembra pine ecosystem from ca. 7.2-6.5 ka BP was associated with enhanced podzolisation processes in the catchment. The progressive soil development was followed by a rapid transformation of the local environment and plant cover (the open waters of the lake were replaced by a confined peat environment) together with changes in forest fire regimes from ca. 6.8 ka BP. Depleted REE patterns, associated with low contents of secondary Al and Fe, suggest a decrease in chemical weathering and podzolization in the catchment at that time, possibly associated with local intensification of weathering and drainage processes in a relatively acidic peat environment. The higher variability of cembra pine and the increased abundance of sedge and other herbaceous plant remains in the lake sediment indicate semi-open vegetation environments from 5.7 cal ka BP onwards. Whereas fire events and plant cover appear to be significantly related, the soil processes seem primarily linked to vegetation composition, and secondarily to changes in fire regime.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key component of the carbon cycle and has significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems and potable water treatment. Upward trends in river and lacaustrine DOC concentrations have been observed and a number of key drivers have been proposed. Here, we present DOC concentration data from plot scale pore waters at one site and surface water from artificial drains sampled within a national survey which demonstrate a significant correlation between peatland vegetation type and DOC concentration. Calluna dominance was associated with the highest DOC concentration, Molinia and Sphagnum dominance with lower concentrations, and sedge dominance with intermediate concentrations. Water sampled from drains dominated by Calluna had greater DOC concentrations than water sampled from pore waters in plots dominated by Calluna. In contrast DOC concentrations from plots dominated by sedges were greater than those sampled from drains dominated by sedges. We discuss these findings in relation to plant functional traits and their influence on the physical and biotic conditions that regulate DOC concentrations. Given the known effects of management activities and climate change on peatland vegetation composition there is potential to manage plant community composition to ameliorate the observed rising DOC concentration.

AB Mobilization and release of carbon from mires to the atmospheric and aquatic systems depend on biogeochemical conditions in the peat soils. These conditions can widely vary within the large boreal mire complexes that are typically composed of a variety of mesoscale ecohydrological landscape units. This study aims to characterize spatial and temporal variations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and major base ion concentrations in surface and soil pore waters of a typical boreal river valley mire complex in northwest Russia. Three mesoscale ecohydrological landscape units were identified based on vegetation, topography and water table characteristics and investigated with regard to their hydrochemistry: bog, fen and marginal swamp forest. The highest DOC concentrations were detected in the swamp forest, and the lowest concentrations were observed at the bog (swamp forest: 42-54 mg L-1, fen: 28-38 mg L-1, bog: 20-28 mg L-1). The transitional swamp forest zone was also the primary contributor of the water discharged from the investigated site. Thus, these transitional zones should be investigated in more detail because these previously largely neglected landscape units appear to have a strong effect on biogeochemical properties of the discharged water and are potentially major greenhouse gas emitters.

AB Northern peatlands play an important role globally in the cycling of C, through the exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere, the emission of CH4, the production and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the storage of C. Under 2 x CO2 GCM scenarios, most Canadian peatlands will be exposed to increases in mean annual temperature ranging between 2 and 6 degrees C and increases in mean annual precipitation of 0 to 15 %, with the most pronounced changes occurring during the winter. The increase in CO2 uptake by plants, through warmer temperatures and elevated atmospheric CO2, is likely to be offset by increased soil respiration rates in response to warmer soils and lowered water tables. CH4 emissions are likely to decrease in most peatlands because of lowered water tables, except where the peat surface adjusts to fluctuating water tables, and in permafrost, where the collapse of dry plateau and palsa will lead to increased CH4 emission. There likely will be little change in DOC production, but DOC export to water bodies will decrease as runoff decreases. The storage of C in peatlands is sensitive to all C cycle components and is difficult to predict. The challenge is to develop quantitative models capable of making these predictions for different peatlands. We present some qualitative responses, with levels of uncertainty. There will be, however, as much variation in response to climatic change within a peatland as there will be among peatland regions.

AB In 65 samples, we got values (unusually replicable and consistent for this type of work) of concentration, C-14/C-13 (AMS) age, and delta C-13 for: peat, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), peat fractions, and dissolved CO2 and CH4 at 50-cm intervals down to 700 cm in Ellergower Moss, a rainwater-dependent raised (domed) bog in southwest Scotland. (1) We attribute the consistency of the results to Ellergower Moss being unusually homogeneous, with unusually low hydraulic conductivity, and containing only a few gas spaces; and to the sampling methods including 18-month equilibration of in situ samplers. (2) The dissolved gas concentration depth profiles are convex and very similar to each other, though CO2 is 5-10 times more concentrated than CH4, while the profile of DOC is concave. (3) The age profile of peat is near linearly proportional to depth; that for DOC is about 500-1000 yr younger than the peat at the same depth; the dissolved gases are 500-4300 years younger than the peat. The age of the operational peat fractions humic acid and humin is similar to that of whole peat. (4) The delta C-13 profile for deep peat is almost constant; delta C-13-CO2 is More enriched than the peat (delta C-13-CO2 35%. more); delta C-13-CH4 is the same amount more depleted. Nearer the surface both dissolved gases become steadily more depleted, delta C-13 is about 20%. less at the surface. (5) A simulation shows that mass flow can account for the concentration and age profiles of DOC, but for the gases diffusion and an additional source near the surface are needed as well, and diffusion accounts for over 99% of the dissolved gas movements. (6) The same processes must operate in other peatlands but the results for Ellergower should not be extrapolated uncritically to them. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, consumption, and quality displayed differences after long-term (similar to 55years) hydrological alterations in a poor fen peatland in northern Michigan. The construction of an earthen levee resulted in areas of a raised and lowered water table (WT) relative to an unaltered intermediate WT site. The lowered WT site had greater peat aeration and larger seasonal vertical WT fluctuations that likely elevated peat decomposition and subsidence with subsequent increases in bulk density, vertical hydraulic gradient, decreased hydraulic conductivity (K-sat), and a greater pore water residence time relative to the unaltered site. The raised WT site displayed a decreased K-sat combined with seasonal upwelling events that contributed to a longer residence time in comparison to the unaltered site. These differences are potentially contributing to elevated DOC concentrations at the lowered and raised WT site relative to the unaltered site. Additionally, spectrophotometric indices and chemical constituent assays indicated that the lowered site DOC was more aromatic and contained elevated concentrations of phenolics compared to the intermediate site. The raised site DOC was less aromatic, less humified, and also had a greater phenolic content than the intermediate site. Furthermore, an incubation experiment showed that DOC in the raised site contained the greatest labile carbon source. Based on our results, long-term WT alterations will likely impose significant effects on DOC dynamics in these peatlands; however, WT position alone was not a good predictor of DOC concentrations, though impoundment appears to produce a more labile DOC whereas drainage increases DOC aromaticity.

AB Peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the most important contributors to carbon budgets in peatland systems. Many studies have investigated factors affecting DOC concentration in peatland systems, yet hillslope position has been thus far overlooked as a variable that could influence DOC cycling. This study investigates the importance of hillslope position with regard to DOC cycling. Two upland peat hillslopes were studied in the Peak District, UK, to determine what impact, if any, hillslope position had upon DOC concentration. Hillslope position was found to be a significant factor affecting variation in soil pore water DOC concentration, with bottom-slope positions having significantly lower DOC concentrations than up-slope because of dilution of DOC as water moves down-slope and is flushed out of the system via lateral throughflow. Water table drawdown on steeper mid-slopes increased DOC concentrations through increased DOC production and extended residence times allowing a build-up of humic-rich DOC compounds. Hillslope position did not significantly affect DOC concentrations in surface runoff water because of the dilution of near-surface soil pore water by precipitation inputs, while stream water had similar water chemistry properties to soil pore water under low-flow conditions.

AB Freshwater marshes are the single largest source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Climate change and anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition can alter the production and oxidation of CH4 respectively and thereby also CH4 exchange. But there was little known about how N regulate key carbon (C) processes, like CH4 production and oxidation under freshwater marshland conditions. In this study, field-fertilization and incubation experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of four N-fertilization treatments (0, 6, 12, 24 g N m(-2)) using ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) on CH4 production and oxidation and the potential mechanisms involved, in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. Both the CH4 production and oxidation of N24 (24 g N m(-2)) treatment was significantly higher than control and other N treatments. The ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations were higher at the N24 treatment compared with the control. The incubation experiment indicated that N-addition stimulated CH4 production more than CH4 oxidation resulting in net CH4 emission from N-fertilization treatments.

AB Western Boreal Canada could experience drier hydrometeorological conditions under future climatic changes, and the drying of nonpermafrost peatlands can lead to higher frequency and extent of wildfires. Despite increasing pressures, our understanding of the impact of fire on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and quality across boreal peatlands is not consistent. This study capitalizes on the rare opportunity of having 3 years of prefire and 3 years of postfire DOC data at a treed, moderate-rich fen in the Western Boreal Plain, northern Alberta, to investigate wildfire effects on peatland DOC dynamics. We investigated whether a wildfire facilitated any changes in the pore water DOC concentration and quality. There was very little impact of the fire directly, with no significant changes in DOC concentrations postfire. We highlight that DOC patterns are more likely to be controlled by local hydrogeological factors than any effect of fire. Fall hydrological conditions and subsequent winter storage processes impose a strong control on DOC concentrations the following year. We suggest that the presence or absence of concrete ground frost in the fen (determined by fall water table position) influences overwinter storage changes, controlling the effect that DOC-poor snowmelt may have on pore water concentrations. However, an increase in SUVA(254) was found 2 years postfire, indicating an increase in aromaticity. These results highlight the need for careful consideration of the local hydrogeologic setting and hydrological regime when predicting and analysing trends in DOC concentrations and quality.

   FEN
AB NORTHERN peatlands can act as either important sources or sinks for atmospheric carbon(1,2). It is therefore important to understand how carbon cycling in these regions will respond to a changing climate. Existing carbon balance models for peatlands assume that fluid flow and advective mass transport are negligible at depth(3,4), and that the effects of climate change should be essentially limited to the near-surface. Here we report the response of groundwater flow and porewater chemistry in the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands of northern Minnesota to the regional drought cycle. Comparison of held observations and numerical simulations indicates that climate fluctuations of short duration may temporarily reverse the vertical direction of fluid flow through the peat, although this has little effect on water chemistry(5). On the other hand, periods of drought persisting for at least 3-5 years produce striking changes in the chemistry of the pore water. These longer-term changes in hydrology influence the flux of nutrients and dissolved organic matter through the deeper peat, and therefore affect directly the rates of fermentation and methanogenesis, and the export of dissolved carbon compounds from the peatland.

AB Over a period of 1 yr, we examined the dynamics of a community of enchytraeid worms in a blanket peat soil in relation to the prevailing climate and the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Our objectives were two-fold: first, we aimed to establish whether there is a relationship between climatic variables and the density of enchytraeid populations; and also assess whether changes in the density of enchytraeid populations, caused by climate, were related to the release of DOC. Our second aim was to predict the consequences of atmospheric warming for the enchytraeid community at the site, and, in turn, the biological contribution to DOC release. Positive linear relationships between the abundance of enchytraeids and soil temperature were found, as well as with concentrations of DOC in the soil solution: We calculate that at mean field density, enchytraeids currently account for up to 26% of the DOC produced in the surface (upper 10 cm) blanket peat. These relationships suggest that future soil warming caused by climate change could increase enchytraeid abundance by 43% and C release by 11% in these peatlands, based on an increase in mean monthly air temperatures of 2.5 degreesC.

AB Vast stores of millennial-aged soil carbon (MSC) in permafrost peatlands risk leaching into the contemporary carbon cycle after thaw caused by climate warming or increased wildfire activity. Here we tracked the export and downstream fate of MSC from two peatland-dominated catchments in subarctic Canada, one of which was recently affected by wildlife. We tested whether thermokarst bog expansion and deepening of seasonally thawed soils due to wildfire increased the contributions of MSC to downstream waters. Despite being available for lateral transport, MSC accounted for <= 6% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pools at catchment outlets. Assimilation of MSC into the aquatic food web could not explain its absence at the outlets. Using delta C-13-Delta C-14-delta N-15-delta H-2 measurements, we estimated only 7% of consumer biomass came from MSC by direct assimilation and algal recycling of heterotrophic respiration. Recent wildfire that caused seasonally thawed soils to reach twice as deep in one catchment did not change these results. In contrast to many other Arctic ecosystems undergoing climate warming, we suggest waterlogged peatlands will protect against downstream delivery and transformation of MSC after climate- and wildfire-induced permafrost thaw.

AB Loss of permafrost can modify the export and composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from subarctic peatlands by changing the hydrological regime and altering ecosystem structure and function. In Stordalen peatland complex (68.20 degrees N, 19.03 degrees E) recent permafrost thaw has caused a conversion of the palsa parts (an ombrotrophic, permafrost affected peatland type) into both bog and flow-through fen peatland types. Within the Stordalen peatland complex we estimated the DOC mass balance and assessed DOC composition for one palsa catchment, one bog catchment and two fens in order to assess the possible impacts of permafrost thaw on peatland complex DOC export. The fens were found to have higher net DOC export rates at 8.1 and 7.0 g C m(-2) yr(-1) than either the palsa or bog catchments, at 3.2 and 3.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The snowmelt period was more important for the annual DOC export from the palsa and bog catchments than for the fens, representing 65-100% of the palsa and bog catchment exports while 35-60% of the net fen exports. DOC exported from the palsa and bog catchments were characterized by high aromaticity, molecular weight, C/N ratios, and contained DOC of primarily terrestrial origin. The fens exhibited a shift in DOC composition between inflows and outflows that suggested that fens act as catchment locations for degradation and transformation of DOC. Permafrost thaw can thus alter the magnitude, timing, and composition of subarctic peatland DOC exports due to interactions among peatland type, permafrost conditions, and hydrological setting.

ID MATTER; SOILS
AB During the last two decades there was observed an increasing trend of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in surface waters, which may affect drinking water treatment. Organic soils which form the largest terrestrial carbon pool are assumed as main sources for DOC. The effect that rewetting of peatlands has on the mobility of DOC has been discussed controversial until yet. Previous study aimed to determine DOC concentrations in the pore water of a progressively rewetted peatland in the National Park Harz Mountains and to identify the main factors which affect DOC mobility during a study period of 4 years. DOC concentrations of the pore water at the rewetted sites were compared with those of a pristine site.

AB The abundances, compositions, and activities of microbial communities were investigated at bog and fen sites in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatland of northwestern Minnesota. These sites contrast in the reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the presence or absence of groundwater inputs. Microbial community composition was characterized using pyrosequencing and clone library construction of phylogenetic marker genes. Microbial distribution patterns were linked to pH, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, C/N ratios, optical properties of DOM, and activities of laccase and peroxidase enzymes. Both bacterial and archaeal richness and rRNA gene abundance were >2 times higher on average in the fen than in the bog, in agreement with a higher pH, labile DOM content, and enhanced enzyme activities in the fen. Fungi were equivalent to an average of 1.4% of total prokaryotes in gene abundance assayed by quantitative PCR. Results revealed statistically distinct spatial patterns between bacterial and fungal communities. Fungal distribution did not covary with pH and DOM optical properties and was vertically stratified, with a prevalence of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota near the surface and much higher representation of Zygomycota in the subsurface. In contrast, bacterial community composition largely varied between environments, with the bog dominated by Acidobacteria (61% of total sequences), while the Firmicutes (52%) dominated in the fen. Acetoclastic Methanosarcinales showed a much higher relative abundance in the bog, in contrast to the dominance of diverse hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the fen. This is the first quantitative and compositional analysis of three microbial domains in peatlands and demonstrates that the microbial abundance, diversity, and activity parallel with the pronounced differences in environmental variables between bog and fen sites.

AB Methane concentration [CH4] and stable isotope ratio values (delta C-13) characterize methanogenic and methanotrophic processes within two contrasting peatland ecosystems of the Fluxnet Canada Research Network: (i) a western Canada peatland fen in northern Alberta (Fen) and (ii) an eastern Canada peatland bog in southeastern Ontario (Bog). We use carbon isotope ratio discrimination of produced methane (delta C-13(CH4)) from the precursor carbon compounds (delta C-13(preC)) to estimate the relative proportions of archaebacterial acetoclastic methanogenesis (AM) and hydrogenotrophic carbonate reduction methanogenesis (HM) in these terrestrial ecosystems. The [CH4] and delta C-13(CH4) signatures describe contrasts in the methanogenic and methanotrophic processes between the Fen and the Bog. The differences are substantiated by stable hydrogen isotope ratio (delta D) separation between the dissolved delta D-CH4 and co-existing delta D-H2O. Methanogenesis at the Fen is dominated by AM, in contrast to the Bog, which is essentially HM. We suggest that this is potentially a result of differences in type/quality of organic substrates. The trajectory of C-13 enrichment in delta C-13(CH4) values with depth at the Bog reflects a closed system, substrate depletion effect. Our Rayleigh distillation model estimates 58-76% depletion in the source dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE insect infestations; defoliation; eastern larch; larch sawfly;
   dendroecology; tree mortality
AB Tree-ring analysis was used to relate the pattern of eastern larch (Larix laricina) growth to insect defoliation over the last three centuries in boreal Quebec. Four sampling sites were selected along a moisture gradient, from a well-drained site to a forested peatland near Lake Bienville, in an area where larch is currently recovering from a recent outbreak of the larch sawfly (Pristiphora erichsonii), a notoriously recurrent defoliator of eastern larch. In the two dry sites, the eastern larch tree-ring series clearly showed eight periods of defoliation-induced growth suppression since 1782. Growth depressions were not as consistent in the more humid sites, especially at the turn of the century (i.e. between 1883 and 1911), when only one infestation was clearly expressed among three successive ones at the dry sites. Time series filtering indicated sharp synchrony of defoliation events among sites. Radial and apical growth during infestations correlated in a complex way, with radial growth being most severely suppressed at the apex and at the root collar. Defoliation of larch caused significant tree mortality in the dry sites. Mortality was directly related to defoliation for a significant fraction of the dead trees sampled. There was a variation in the number of years of suppressed growth without recovery prior to death, as well as in the number of severe infestations that were successfully overcome, before the final assault. The age structure of the extant larch population at one of the dry sites indicated a lack of recruitment over the last century. Our study suggests that larch sawfly outbreaks had a considerable long-term impact on the forest structure. In the absence of fires, the long-term effect may be a gradual substitution of the mixed black spruce-eastern larch forest by a monospecific black spruce forest.

AB Water flows in peatland margins is an under-researched topic. This study examines recharge from a peatland to an esker aquifer in an aapa mire complex of northern Finland. Our objective was to study how the aapa mire margin is hydrogeologically connected to the riverside aquifer and spatial and temporal variations in the recharge of peatland water to groundwater (GW). Following geophysical studies and monitoring of the saturated zone, a GW model (MODFLOW) was used in combination with stable isotopes to quantify GW flow volumes and directions. Peatland water recharge to the sandy aquifer indicated a strong connection at the peatland-aquifer boundary. Recharge volumes from peatland to esker were high and rather constant (873 m (3) d (-1) ) and dominated esker recharge at the study site. The peat water recharging the esker boundary was rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Stable isotope studies on water ( delta (18) O, delta (2) H, and d-excess) from GW wells verified the recharge of DOC-rich water from peatlands to mineral soil esker. Biogeochemical analysis revealed changes from DOC to dissolved inorganic carbon in the flow pathway from peatland margin to the river Kitinen. This study highlights the importance of careful investigation of aapa mire margin areas and their potential role in regional GW recharge patterns.

AB The release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peatlands implies a loss of sequestered carbon. During the last two decades, an increase of DOC exports in Europe and North America has been reported. The influence of land use on DOC has been contradictorily discussed and a lack of knowledge exists particularly for fens in Northeastern Germany. Therefore, we aimed to investigate DOC release from fen soils with differing land use intensity. To exclude climatic influences and water level fluctuations, a lysimeter study was performed. The lysimeter vessels contained three histosols from Northeastern Germany and varied in peat quantity, substrate quality, water table depth, pH and vegetation, as these factors are strongly influenced by land use intensity. Water for DOC analysis was sampled biweekly over a two year period. DOC release ranged from 4 to 123 mg/L-1 with a median of 32 +/- 22 mg/L-1. Lowest DOC concentrations were found at deeply drained gleysols and at relatively slightly decomposed, acidic histosols. Highest concentrations were measured in the most degraded histosols. Degree of decomposition and pH were found to be the major driving factors for DOC release. Long-lasting rewetted lysimeters were not observed to release a lower amount of DOC than drained ones, which may be of importance when restoration of degraded peatlands is intended. As lysimeters from the same site released relatively similar amounts of DOC despite their varying management during the last 50 years, it appears that peatlands have an individual potential for DOC release.

AB When the substrate surface and drainage holes of feather fiber, peat, and plastic containers were sealed with wax, hyperbolic growth curves were good fits to cumulative water loss on a per container and per cm(2) basis, with R-2 values ranging from 0.88 to 0.96. The effect of container type was significant as the differences in asymptotic maximum water loss (max) values for all container pairs were significant at P < 0.05 for both water loss per container and water loss per cm(2). The predicted total water loss for peat containers was approximate to2.5 times greater than feather containers, and the predicted water loss per cm(2) for the peat container was approximate to3 times greater than feather containers. Vinca [Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don.]'Cooler Blush' and impatiens (Impatiens walleriana Hook f.) 'Dazzler Rose Star' plants grown in feather and peat containers required more water and more frequent irrigations than those grown in plastic containers. However, plants grown in feather containers required less water and fewer irrigations than plants grown in peat containers. The surface area of containers covered by algal or fungal growth was significantly higher on peat containers than on feather containers. No fungal or algal growth was observed on plastic containers. Additionally, primarily algae were observed on peat containers whereas most discoloration observed on feather containers was due to fungal growth. Dry feather containers had a higher longitudinal strength than dry plastic containers but a lower longitudinal strength than dry peat containers. Wet feather containers had higher longitudinal strength than wet peat containers but a similar longitudinal strength as wet plastic containers. Dry feather and plastic containers had similar lateral strengths and both had significantly higher lateral strength than dry peat containers. Wet feather containers had significantly lower lateral strength than wet plastic containers but had higher lateral strength than wet peat containers. Dry and, wet plastic containers had higher punch strength than wet or dry peat and feather containers. Dry peat containers had significantly higher punch strength than dry feather containers. However, wet feather containers had significantly higher punch strength than wet peat containers. Decomposition of peat and feather containers was significantly affected by container type and the species grown in the container. When planted with tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum L.) 'Better Boy', decomposition was not significantly different between the peat and feather containers. However, when vinca and marigold (Tagetes patula L.) 'Janie Bright Yellow' were grown in the containers, decomposition was significantly higher for feather containers than for peat containers. Therefore, containers made from processed feather fiber provided a new type of biodegradable container with significantly improved characteristics as compared to peat containers.

AB Peatlands export more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than any other biome, contributing 20% of all terrestrial DOC exported to the oceans. Both warming and elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) can increase DOC exports, but their interaction is poorly understood. Peat monoliths were, therefore, exposed to eCO(2), warming and eCO(2) + warming (combined). The combined treatment produced a synergistic (i.e., significant interaction) rise in DOC concentrations available for export (119% higher than the control, interaction P < 0.05) and enriched this pool with phenolic compounds (284%). We attribute this to increased plant inputs, coupled with impaired microbial degradation induced by competition with the vegetation for nutrients and inhibitory phenolics. Root biomass showed a synergistic increase (407% relative to the control, P < 0.1 only), while exudate inputs increased additively. Phenol oxidase was suppressed synergistically (58%, interaction P < 0.1 only) and beta-glucosidase (27%) additively, while microbial nutritional stress increased (51%) additively. Such results suggest intensified carbon exports from peatlands, with potentially widespread ramifications for aquatic processes in the receiving waters.

AB In the Athabasca oil sands region near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, peatlands are disturbed extensively in order to recover bitumen below the surface. Hence, following oil sands mining, landscape reclamation is a part of the mine closure process in order to return functioning ecosystems, including peatlands, to the region. This study was conducted at a pilot fen reclamation project and three other diverse natural (poor, rich and saline) fens in the oil sands region during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014, the first and second year post-construction. Ecosystem functioning of the constructed fen (CF) was evaluated with reference to natural fens based on pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and chemistry. Significant variation of DOC concentration among the reference fens was observed, varying from an average of 42.0 mg/L at the rich fen (RF) to 70.8 mg/L at the saline fen (SF). Dissolved organic carbon concentration at CF was significantly lower than at all reference fens, but increased significantly over the first two years. Seasonal variation of DOC concentration was also observed in each site with concentration increasing over the growing season. At CF, DOC was comprised of larger, more humic and complex aromatic compounds than reference fens in the first year post-construction based on its spectrophotometric properties; however, these differences were reduced in the second year. Initial DOC concentration and chemistry at CF was indicative of the source being largely the peat placed during fen construction. Changes in chemistry and increasing concentration of DOC in the second growing season likely resulted from increasing inputs from plants established on site. These results suggest that DOC concentration is likely to increase in future at CF as vascular plant productivity increases and in response to salinity sourced from tailing sand used to construct the catchment.

AB Over half of the world's peat originated from Sphagnum, representing 10-15% of the terrestrial carbon stock. However, information regarding the release and exudation of organic carbon by living Sphagnum plants into the surface peat is scarce. In this study, we examined the contribution of recent Sphagnum subnitens (Russ. and Warnst.) photosynthate carbon to the peatland dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. This was done using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase experimental approach during the growing season. Despite the importance of Sphagnum in long-term carbon accumulation, results showed that the Sphagnum community rapidly contributes recently synthesized carbon to the peatland DOC pool. We estimate that by 4 h up to 4% of the total DOC in peat leachate was derived from (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling at ambient CO2 concentrations. Nonetheless, a huge 64% of the C-13 initially assimilated by photosynthesis was retained in Sphagnum subnitens for 23 days after labelling, consistent with the role of Sphagnum in peatland carbon accumulation. The majority of C-13 loss as respired CO2 came within the few days post (CO2)-C-13 labelling, suggesting that it was derived from plant respiration of photosynthates.

AB The perhumid coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) of southeast Alaska has some of the densest soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the world (> 300 Mg C ha(-1)) but the fate of this SOC with continued warming remains largely unknown. We quantified dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and carbon dioxide (CO2) yields from four different wetland types (rich fen, poor fen, forested wetland and cedar wetland) using controlled laboratory incubations of surface (10 cm) and subsurface (25 cm) soils incubated at 8 and 15 A degrees C for 37 weeks. Furthermore, we used fluorescence characterization of DOC and laboratory bioassays to assess how climate-induced soil warming may impact the quality and bioavailability of DOC delivered to fluvial systems. Soil temperature was the strongest control on SOC turnover, with wetland type and soil depth less important in controlling CO2 flux and extractable DOC. The high temperature incubation increased average CO2 yield by similar to 40 and similar to 25% for DOC suggesting PCTR soils contain a sizeable pool of readily biodegradable SOC that can be mineralized to DOC and CO2 with future climate warming. Fluxes of CO2 were positively correlated to both extractable DOC and percent bioavailable DOC during the last few months of the incubation suggesting mineralization of SOC to DOC is a strong control of soil respiration rates. Whether the net result is increased export of either carbon form will depend on the balance between the land to water transport of DOC and the ability of soil microbial communities to mineralize DOC to CO2.

AB The copper hall was a special type of building in Chinese architectural history. It imitates traditional Chinese timber architecture in terms of structure, but with all its components cast out of copper alloys and then assembled. During the Wanli reign of the Ming dynasty, three such Buddhist copper halls were constructed from 1602 to 1607, and set up at Emei Mountain, Baohua Mountain, and Wutai Mountain. The present article makes several points. First, the three copper halls were from the same design, as determined through historical texts and on-site investigation. In conception, they may have been inspired by Taoist copper halls, but did not follow those particular designs. Furthermore, the author has created a statistical database of all the inscriptions from Wutai Copper Hall and loaded the data into the GIS platform, which was keyed to a historical map of 1582. The data suggest that the patrons of Wutai Copper Hall lived in areas along the Grand Canal, the Sanggan River, and the Fen River; and that the patrons were numerous. The Chan Master Miaofeng was not only an organizer but also an experienced project manager who preferred brick, stone and metal to timber. Under his organizing and management, people from different social classes and communities willingly contributed. Finally, this paper contextualizes the Buddhist building projects of the late Wanli period. The inscriptions in Wutai Copper Hall reliably record a vivid landscape of Ming society. The donation initiated by Miaofeng was not merely a personal action but also an influential event the effect of which lasted for years. The numerous patrons were organized not by the power afforded by any state representative, but by networks of monks, nuns, merchants, local religious communities, and pilgrim associations. Copper halls, especially Wutai Copper Hall, are excellent evidence for how religious monumental projects were organized, managed, and implemented in late Ming society.

AB The relationship between ground-water fluctuations and the canopy compositions of five tidal freshwater swamps were examined. Tide gauge data were compared with measured ground-water fluctuations to assess the role of tides in driving the hydrologic regimes of tidal swamps. Flooding in tidal swamps was found to be closely associated with high tides. As the tides dropped through the hummock zone (elevated area, about 15 cm high, to which the trees are restricted), drainage of the hollows (low areas between hummocks) occurred at the same rate as the falling tides. After the tides dropped below the elevation of the hollows, the lowering of the water table became much slower than that of the falling tides, presumably because peat in the root zone inhibited drainage. When the subsequent rising tides reached the elevation of the water table, the water table rose vertically with the tides. Flooding recurred in the hollows as the tides rose above the surface of the ground. The composition of the canopy was found to be related to the mean water-table depth (WTD) (i.e., the depth in relation to the hummock elevation at which the soil was flooded 50% of the time) and not to the duration, depth, or frequency of flooding. Tidal swamps dominated by Fraxinus spp. and Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora occurred in the wetter sites (mean WTD = 17 cm), whereas swamps dominated by Acer rubrum and Liquidambar styraciflua occurred in less wet sites (mean WTD = 21 to 30 cm). Tidal freshwater swamps are precariously positioned at the upper portion of the tidal range where they seem to keep pace with a rising sea level by accumulating biomass (logs and roots). Potential threats to the distribution and areal extent of tidal freshwater swamps include any abrupt changes in the rate of sea-level rise, periodic logging, or blockage of their upriver migration due to incompatible land use.

AB Melissa R. Hendrickson & Chris Groves: From sink to resurgence: the buffering capacity of a cave system in the Tongass national forest, USA
   The Tongass National Forest of Southeast Alaska, USA, provides a unique environment for monitoring the impact of the cave system on water quality and biological productivity The accretionary terrane setting of the area has developed Into a complex and heterogeneous geologic landscape which includes numerous blocks of limestone with intense karstification. During the Wisconsian glaciation, there were areas of compacted glacial sediments and silts deposited over the bedrock. Muskeg peatlands developed over these poorly drained areas. The dominant plants of the muskeg ecosystem arc Sphagnum mosses, whose decomposition leads to highly acidic waters with pH as low as 2.4. These waters drain off the muskegs into the cave systems, eventually running to the ocean. In accordance with the Tongass Land Management Plan, one of the research priorities of the National Forest is to determine the contributions of karst groundwater systems to productivity of aquatic communities. On Northern Prince of Wales Island, the Conk Canyon Cave insurgence and the Mop Spring resurgence were continuously monitored to understand the buffering capacity of the cave system. Over the length of the system, the pH increases from an average 3.89 to 7.22. The insurgence water temperature, during the summer months, ranged from between 10 degrees C to 17 degrees C. After residence in the cave system, the resurgence water had been buffered to 6 degrees C to 9 degrees C. Over the continuum from insurgence to resurgence, the specific conductance haul increased by an order of magnitude with the resurgence waters having a higher ionic strength. The cave environment acts as a buffer on the incoming acidic muskeg water to yield resurgence water chemistry of a buffered karst system. These buffered waters contribute to the productivity in aquatic environments downstream. The waters from this system drain into Whale Pass, an important location for the salmon industry. The cool, even temperatures, as well as buffered flow rates delivered by the karst systems are associated with higher productivity of juvenile coho salmon.

AB Radiocarbon dating and carbon isotope analyses of deep peat and gases in a small ombrogenous peatland in northwestern Ontario reveals the presence of old gases at depth that are 1000-2000 yr younger than the enclosing peat. We suggest that the most likely explanation to account for this age discrepancy is the downward movement by advection of younger dissolved organic carbon for use by fermentation and methanogens bacteria. This study identifies a potentially large supply of old carbon gases in peatlands that should be considered in global carbon models of the terrestrial biosphere.

AB Dystrophic freshwaters referred to as humic, brown, or black waters are typical for boreal or some mountainous regions where fens and coniferous forests form a significant part of basins. I evaluated the usefulness of the Hydrochemical Dystrophy Index (HDI) which has been developed for dystrophic lakes in Poland, on the basis of a rich database for lakes in Sweden and data provided by other researchers for lakes from Finland and Russia. I propose a new version of HDI for synthetic and quantitative description of habitat conditions in lakes and for use in limnological monitoring of protected areas. The state of dystrophy was evaluated using data for surface water pH, electric conductivity (EC), DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) and DOC (dissolved organic carbon) concentrations. HDI values between 50 and 65 indicate semidystrophic conditions and with advanced a real dystrophy, they reach HDI values from 65 up to 100. Long term data shows that lake dystrophy is fairly steady with seasonal fluctuations. I show that the level of lake dystrophy is not correlated to latitude, but rather to small lake areas, regional geochemical spots, and favorable local hydrological conditions. A summary description of the main parameters of various types of humic lakes is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In five tributary streams (four inflowing and one outflowing) of 1600-ha Trout Lake in northern Wisconsin, USA, we examined factors that can affect the magnitude of stream flow and transport of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) through the streams to the lake. One catchment, the Allequash Creek basin, was investigated in more detail to describe the dynamics of carbon flow and to identify potential carbon sources. Stream flows and carbon loads showed little or no relation to surface-water catchment area. They were more closely related to ground-water watershed area because ground-water discharge, from both local and regional sources, is a major contributor to the hydrologic budgets of these catchments. An important factor in determining carbon influx to the stream is the area of peatland in the catchment. Peatland porewaters contain DOC concentrations up to 40 mg l(-1) and are a significant potential carbon source. Ground-water discharge and lateral flow through peat are the suspected mechanisms for transport of that carbon to the streams. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes suggested that the sources of DOC in Allequash Creek above Allequash Lake were wetland vegetation and peat and that the sources below Allequash Lake were filamentous algae and wild rice. Catchments with high proportions of peatland, including the Allequash Creek catchment, tended to have elevated DOC loads in outflowing stream water. Respiration and carbon mineralization in lakes within the system tend to produce low DOC and low DOC/DIC in lake outflows, especially at Trout Lake. In Allequash Lake, however, the shallow peat island and vegetation-filled west end were sources of DOC. Despite the vast carbon reservoir in the peatlands, carbon yields were very low in these catchments. Maximum yields were on the order of 2.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DOC and 5.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DIC. The small yields were attributable to low stream flows due to lack of significant overland runoff and very limited stream channel coverage of the total catchment area.

AB Body temperature has a major influence on the physiological processes, growth, reproductive output, and overall survival of ectotherms. When a habitat is altered as a result of natural or anthropogenic influences, the available temperatures in the habitat can change, thus affecting an animal's ability to thermoregulate. We studied thermoregulation in response to habitat change in a population of spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata) in Southern Ontario, Canada. Historically, the study site was ditched to draw down water levels to facilitate peat mining, and the resulting drainage ditches were the only habitat containing surface water and turtles were restricted to these drains. Recent colonization of the site by beaver (Castor canadensis) caused increases in water level and water surface area. We followed spotted turtles (N=16) outfitted with radio transmitters and iButtons to estimate body temperatures (T-b) continuously throughout the active season post-flooding. Turtle models outfitted with iButtons (N=50) were deployed in the nine available habitat types to record environmental temperatures (T-e). Turtles (N=13) were tested in a thermal gradient under laboratory conditions to determine preferred body temperature range (T-set). The T-set for the population ranged from 20 degrees C to 26 degrees C. In the field, T-b was within the T-set range 28% of the time from March to October, and 67% of the time from July to August. Efficiency of thermoregulation was calculated to be highest in July and August. The habitat type with the highest thermal quality was the shallow flooded zone created by beaver damming, and the habitat with the lowest thermal quality was the drain bottom, the drains being the only aquatic habitat available prior to flooding. This study confirms that beaver flooding provided a wide variety of preferable thermal opportunities for spotted turtles. Further investigation is needed to determine the effects of flooding on spotted turtle thermoregulation during nesting and hibernation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Changes to climate are projected over the next 50 years for many peatland areas. As decomposition of peat forming vegetation is likely to be intrinsically linked to these changes in climate, a clear understanding of climate-peat dynamics is required. There is concern that increased temperature and decreased precipitation could increase the rate of decomposition and put the carbon sink status of many peatlands at risk, yet few studies have examined the impact of both climatic factors together. To better understand the sensitivity of peatland decomposition to changes in both temperature and precipitation and their interaction, we conducted a short-term laboratory experiment in which plant litters and peat soil were incubated, in isolation, in a factorial design. Treatments simulated baseline and projected climate averages derived from the latest UK climate change projections (UKCP09) for Exmoor, a climatically marginal peatland in SW England. Regular carbon dioxide flux measurements were made throughout the simulation, as well as total mass loss and total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leached. The largest effect on carbon loss in this multifactor experiment was from substrate, with Sphagnum/peat releasing significantly less C in total during the experiment than dwarf shrubs/graminoids. Climate effects were substrate specific, with the drier rainfall treatment increasing the DOC leaching from Callum, but decreasing it from Sphagnum. Partitioning between CO2 and DOC was also affected by climate, but only for the peat and Sphagnum samples, where the future climate scenarios (warmer and drier) resulted in a greater proportion of C lost in gaseous form. These results suggest that indirect effects of climate through changes in species composition in peatlands could ultimately turn out to be more important for litter decomposition than direct effects of climate change from increased temperatures and decreased rainfall.

AB The objective of the current laboratory study was to assess the effects of a number of amendment materials and the depth of incorporation on water retention. 300 mm rootzone profiles were established in 150 mm diameter plastic cylinders over a 50 mm gravel drainage layer. Five amendment materials (sphagnum peat, compost, zeolite, TerraCottem and Stockosorb) were mixed with a medium-coarse sand at various rates. The upper rootzone layer (0-150 mm) included 50%, 100% and 150% of published or manufacturersa recommended rates of each amendment material. Three amendment rates were included in the lower rootzone layer (150-300 mm): pure sand, half the amendment rate of the top layer, and the same amendment rate as the top layer. The following measurements were made: water retention in individual layers, volumetric water content in the top layer (0-60 mm), shear strength, surface hardness, permanent wilting point. Water retention was significantly influenced by the different amendment materials. The most water retentive mixes were those containing peat and Stockosorb, whilst the least retentive contained the TerraCottem and the pure sand. The influence of amendment rate in the lower layer was less in comparison with the top layer. The incorporation of amendment materials in the lower rootzone had no significant effect on water retention in the upper rootzone but did increase the total water storage in the profile and this would have some implications for plant growth during drier periods.
   Rootzone mixes containing peat and compost had the highest shear strength whilst the Stockosorb gave the lowest strength because the expansion of the polymer reduced rootzone density and therefore the degree of contact between the sand particles. The hardest surface was measured when zeolite was used and the softest surfaces resulted from the use of Stockosorb.

AB Volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination of subsurface geological material and groundwater was discovered on the Nortel Monkstown industrial site, Belfast, Northern Ireland. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the characteristics of the geological material and its influences on contaminated groundwater flow across the site using borehole logs and hydrological evaluations, and (2) identify the contaminants and examine their distribution in the subsurface geological material and groundwater using chemical analysis. This report focuses on the eastern car park (ECP) which was a former storage area associated with trichloroethene (TCE) degreasing operations. This is where the greatest amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly TCE, were detected. The study site is on a complex deposit of clayey glacial till with discontinuous coarser grained lenses, mainly silts, sands and gravel, which occur at 0.45-7.82 m below ground level (bgl). The lenses overall form an elongated formation that acts as a small unconfined shallow aquifer. There is a continuous low permeable stiff clayey till layer beneath the lenses that performs as an aquitard to the groundwater. Highest concentrations of VOCs, mainly TCE, in the geological material and groundwater are in these coarser lenses at similar to 4.5-7 m bgl. Highest TCE measurements at 390,000 mu g L-1 for groundwater and at 39,000 mu g kg(-1) at 5.7 m for geological material were in borehole GA19 in the coarse lens zone. It is assumed that TCE gained entrance to the subsurface near this borehole where the clayey till was thin to absent above coarse lenses which provided little retardation to the vertical migration of this dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) into the groundwater. However, TCE is present in low concentrations in the geological material overlying the coarse lens zone. Additionally, VOCs appear to be associated with poorly drained layers and in peat < 3.0 m bgl in the ECP. Some indication of natural attenuation as VOCs degradation products vinyl chloride (VC) and dichloromethane (DCM) also occur on the site.

AB Peatlands are often regarded as metal repositories, but under drought conditions may switch from sinks to sources of metals and contaminate downstream ecosystems. To evaluate whether the release of metals into soil solution in peatlands is predictable using simple, widely available soil parameters, six peatlands, with varying levels of metal contamination, including a previously limed peatland, were sampled around the Sudbury, Ontario, region, and were subjected to simulated drought. The simulated drought lowered soil water pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, which is consistent with field observations. Metal partitioning (K-d) values for Co, Mn, Ni, and Zn, with just one exception at one peatland, could be significantly predicted by just the pH of the soil water, although the strength of the relationship varied considerably among sites. The metal speciation model WHAM VII predicted that the free metal ion concentration of all metals tested, including Cu and Al, increased significantly with decreasing pH. At the same time, DOC-bound metal concentrations were predicted to decrease as DOC levels were lower, which for metals with strong organic matter affinities (Cu and Al) offset the increase in free metal ion concentration in soil solution following summer drought. Climate change forecasts for more frequent and sustained droughts may promote metal release from peatlands and increased mobilization to surface waters, and importantly, for some metals, the potential toxicity of the metals released from peatlands may increase to a greater extent than expected from increases in total metal concentrations because of decreased DOC following drought.

AB 1. Many studies have shown traditional species diversity indices to perform poorly in discriminating anthropogenic influences on biodiversity. By contrast, in marine systems, taxonomic distinctness indices that take into account the taxonomic relatedness of species have been shown to discriminate anthropogenic effects. However, few studies have examined the performance of taxonomic distinctness indices in freshwater systems.
   2. We studied the performance of four species diversity indices and four taxonomic distinctness indices for detecting anthropogenic effects on stream macroinvertebrate assemblages. Further, we examined the effects of catchment type and area, as well as two variables (pH and total phosphorus) potentially describing anthropogenic perturbation on biodiversity.
   3. We found no indications of degraded biodiversity at the putatively disturbed sites. However, species density, rarefied species richness, Shannon's diversity and taxonomic diversity showed higher index values in streams draining mineral as opposed to peatland catchments.
   4. Of the major environmental gradients analysed, biodiversity indices showed the strongest relationships with catchment area, lending further support to the importance of stream size for macroinvertebrate biodiversity. Some of the indices also showed weak linear and quadratic relationships to pH and total phosphorus, and residuals from the biodiversity index-catchment area regressions (i.e. area effect standardized) were more weakly related to pH and total phosphorus than the original index values.
   5. There are a number of reasons why the biodiversity indices did not respond to anthropogenic perturbation. First, some natural environmental gradients may mask the effects of perturbation on biodiversity. Secondly, perturbations of riverine ecosystems in our study area may not be strong enough to cause drastic changes in biodiversity. Thirdly, multiple anthropogenic stressors may either increase or decrease biodiversity, and thus the coarse division of sites into reference and altered streams may be an oversimplification.
   6. Although neither species diversity nor taxonomic distinctness indices revealed anthropogenic degradation of macroinvertebrate assemblages in this study, the traditional species diversity and taxonomic distinctness indices were very weakly correlated. Therefore, we urge that biodiversity assessment and conservation planning should utilize a number of different indices, as they may provide complementary information about biotic assemblages.

AB Thermokarst lakes are widely distributed on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which accounts for 8% of the global permafrost area. These lakes probably promote organic matter biodegradation and thus accelerate the emission of carbon-based greenhouse gases. However, little is known about greenhouse gas concentrations and their stable isotopes characteristics of these lakes. In this study, we measured the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved CO2 and CH4, as well as the distribution of delta C-13(CO2), delta C-13(CH4), and delta C-13(OM) (organic matter) of lake sediments in thermokarst lakes on the QTP. Results showed that the OM of the lake sediments was highly decomposed. The concentrations of DOC, CO2 and CH4 in the lake water on the QTP were 1.2-49.6 mg L-1, 3.6-45.0 mu mol L-1 and 0.28-3.0 mu mol L-1, respectively. The highest CO2 and CH4 concentrations were recorded in July while the lowest values in September, which suggested that temperature had an effect on greenhouse gas production, although this pattern may also relate to thermal stratification of the water column. The results implied that thermokast lakes should be paid more attention to regarding carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions on the QTP.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and fluxes were determined over the summer in a small subarctic catchment, composed of an upland component with woodland and forest over mineral soils and a fen in the lower section. DOC concentrations were low (1-2 mg L-1) in precipitation and increased in tree throughfall and stemflow (50 and 150 mg L-1), shrub throughfall (17 mg L-1), the leachate of the surface lichens and mosses (30 mg L-1), and the soil A horizons (40 mg L-1). Concentrations decreased in the reddish-brown B horizons (17 mg L-1) and there was evidence of strong DOC adsorption by the subsoils. DOC concentrations in peat water averaged 17 mg L-1, but the stream draining the catchment contained an average of 10 mg DOC L-1, amounting to a summer export of about 1 g m-2 for the whole catchment. Summer DOC concentrations in streams draining 10 catchments ranged from 2 to 16 mg L-1 and were positively related to the proportion of the catchment occupied by peatland, illustrating the importance of subarctic fens as a source of DOC.

AB Leaf litter is an important source of natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in forested catchments. Rainwater percolating through fresh litter obtains higher concentrations of DOC and colour than from older forest floor material and organic soils. Chemical characterisation using DOC fractionation and tests of biodegradability show that natural litter percolates contain significant fractions of coloured and highly refractory hydrophobic acids (humic substances) and variable fractions of biodegradable compounds. Deciduous leaf litter imparts high DOC concentrations in the autumn, while coniferous litter and organic soils release DOC more evenly. Leaching from fresh deciduous litter may explain the seasonality in the concentration of DOC in discharge from forested catchments. Countrywide Norwegian data show very poor relationships between occurrences of mires in the catchment of lakes and water colour. High concentrations of DOC may occur in lakes where the catchment has a high proportion of surface runoff due to thin or impermeable soils or swamp areas. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Peatlands are an important global carbon reservoir. The continued accumulation of carbon in peatlands depends on the persistence of anoxic conditions, in part induced by water saturation, which prevents oxidation of organic matter, and slows down decomposition. Here we investigate how and over what time scales the hydrological regime impacts the geochemistry and the bacterial community structure of temperate peat soils. Peat cores from two sites having contrasting groundwater budgets were subjected to four controlled drought-rewetting cycles. Pore water geochemistry and metagenomic profiling of bacterial communities showed that frequent water table drawdown induced lower concentrations of dissolved carbon, higher concentrations of sulfate and iron and reduced bacterial richness and diversity in the peat soil and water. Short-term drought cycles (3-9 day frequency) resulted in different communities from continuously saturated environments. Furthermore, the site that has more frequently experienced water table drawdown during the last two decades presented the most striking shifts in bacterial community structure, altering biogeochemical functioning of peat soils. Our results suggest that the increase in frequency and duration of drought conditions under changing climatic conditions or water resource use can induce profound changes in bacterial communities, with potentially severe consequences for carbon storage in temperate peatlands.

AB Detailed carbon budgets from 2008 to 2010 were created for two 1-ha flow-through riverine wetlands created in 1994 adjacent to a third-order stream in central Ohio. Measurements were taken of dissolved non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), fine particulate organic carbon (FPOM), and coarse particulate organic carbon (CPOM). Methane emissions, soil sequestration, aquatic primary productivity, and macrophyte aboveground net primary productivity were also included in the carbon budget. The carbon budget successfully balanced inputs (1838 +/- 41 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and export/sequestration (1846 +/- 59 g C m(-2) year(-1)) with only a 0.5 % over estimation of export in relation to input; 12.8 % of the inflow was sequestered into the wetland soil. FPOM and CPOM concentrations and exports were positively correlated with hydrologic flow under most circumstances; NPOC and DIC concentrations were usually negatively or poorly correlated with hydrologic flow. In all seasons, except winter, the change of total carbon (NPOC, DIC, FPOM, and CPOM) concentration between inflow and outflow increased with increased hydrologic flow. Although carbon concentrations increased from inflow to outflow, the total surface water export of carbon is less than the inflow due to groundwater recharge from these perched wetlands.

AB Global warming can substantially affect the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peatpermafrost to aquatic systems. The direct degradability of such peat-derived DOC, however, is poorly constrained because previous permafrost thaw studies have mainly addressed mineral soil catchments or DOC pools that have already been processed in surface waters. We incubated peat cores from a palsa mire to compare an active layer and an experimentally thawed permafrost layer with regard to DOC composition and degradation potentials of pore water DOC. Our results show that DOC from the thawed permafrost layer had high initial degradation potentials compared with DOC from the active layer. In fact, the DOC that showed the highest bio-and photo-degradability, respectively, originated in the thawed permafrost layer. Our study sheds new light on the DOC composition of peat-permafrost directly upon thaw and suggests that past estimates of carbon-dioxide emissions from thawed peat permafrost may be biased as they have overlooked the initial mineralization potential of the exported DOC.

AB Climate change may cause increasing tree cover in boreal peatlands, and the impacts of this encroachment will be noted first at forested-to-open bog ecotones. We investigate key metrics of ecosystem function in five such ecotones at a peatland complex in Western Siberia. Stratigraphic analysis of three cores from one of these transects shows that the ecotone has been dynamic over time with evidence for recent expansion of forested peatland. We observed that the two alternative states for northern boreal peatlands (forested/open) clearly support distinct plant and microbial communities. These in turn drive and respond to a number of feedback mechanisms. This has led to steep ecological gradients across the ecotones. Tree cover was associated with lower water tables and pH, along with higher bulk density, aquatic carbon concentrations, and electrical conductivity. We propose that the conditions found in the forested peatland of Western Siberia make the carbon sink more vulnerable to warmer and drier conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous catchment characteristics including topography, geology, soil and vegetation are reported to exert a strong influence on mean surface water properties. The present study employs a geographical information system (GIS) approach to examine, for the first time, the relationship between reservoir water quality [dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, colour, nitrate concentration and pH] and catchment Phase 1 Habitat coverage. Analysis was conducted on two occasions and at two different spatial scales. Numerous statistically significant correlations were identified, suggesting the use of Phase 1 Habitat data could help improve predictive models of surface water quality. The occurrence and strength of correlations varied seasonally in response, we argue, to temporal variations in hydrological regime and anthropogenic activity. The data also suggest that the proximity of habitat types to the reservoir is significant in affecting reservoir water quality. The findings are used to recommend suitable measures for drinking water companies to mitigate against water quality issues.

AB Data on small-scale spatial variations in instantaneous fluxes and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and free carbon dioxide (CO2) are presented for a small acidic headwater stream in NE Scotland, Chloride is used as a conservative element to estimate additional, diffuse inputs of water into the main stem of the stream, other than those from tributaries. Downstream changes in instantaneous carbon fluxes were calculated and then used to estimate losses and gains of carbon within the stream system. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the stream ranged from 1,19-6.06 mg l(-1) at its source to a maximum of 10.0-25.3 mg l(-1) as the stream passed through deep peats; DOC concentrations then declined in the lower part of the catchment. DIC concentrations were initially low, increased to 1.5-3.0 mg l(-1) and then decreased to 0.1-1.65 mg l(-1) at the lowest site. Free CO2 concentrations increased from 0.35 mg l(-1) at the stream source to 3.30 mg l(-1) as the stream passed through the peat dominated area. Continually high inputs of CO2-rich water (> 6.0 mg l(-1)) from tributaries maintained these high concentrations in the main stem, until approximately 1.74 km downstream when there was a rapid decline in concentration, Significant changes in DOG, DIC and CO2 fluxes occur over a distance of 2.7 km downstream from the stream source to the catchment outlet, Between 5.64-41.5 mg C s(-1) as DOC and 2.52-16.2 mg Cs as DIC are removed from the water column. Between 6.81 and 19.0 mg C s(-1) as CO2 is lost along the stream length as progressive equilibration with the atmosphere occurs. We estimate that 11.6-17.6% of the total DOC flux is removed from streamwater by in-stream processes. Dissolved inorganic carbon(HCO3- and free CO2) losses are in excess of nine times its measured flux at the outlet of the catchment. These results suggest that in-stream processing of DOC and DIC and outgassing of CO2 are important controls on the spatial variability of carbon fluxes within headwater streams in upland catchments dominated by organic-rich soils.

AB The extensive blanket peatlands of the UK uplands account for almost half of total national terrestrial carbon storage. However, much of the blanket peat is severely eroded so that the contemporary role of the peatland system in carbon sequestration is compromised by losses of organic carbon in dissolved (DOC) and particulate (POC) form in the fluvial system. This paper presents the first detailed assessment of dissolved and organic carbon losses from a severely eroded headwater peatland (River Ashop, South Pennines, UK). Total annual fluvial organic carbon losses range from 29106?Mg?C km,-2 decreasing from the headwaters to the main catchment outlet. In contrast to less eroded systems fluvial organic carbon flux is dominated by POC center dot POC:DOC ratios decrease from values of 4 in the headwaters to close to unity at the catchment outlet. These results demonstrate the importance of eroding headwater sites as sources of POC to the fluvial system. Comparison with a range of catchment characteristics reveals that drainage density is the best predictor of POC:DOC but there is scatter in the relation in the headwaters. Steep declines in specific POC yield from headwater catchments are consistent with storage of POC within the fluvial system. Key to the significance of fluvial carbon flux in greenhouse gas budgets is understanding the fate of fluvial carbon. Further work on the fate of POC and the role of floodplains in fluvial carbon cycling is urgently required. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Mountains contain many small and fragmented peatlands within watersheds. As they are difficult to monitor, their role in the water and carbon cycle is often disregarded. This study aims to assess the stream organic carbon exports from a montane peatland and characterizes its contribution to the water chemistry in a headstream watershed. High frequency in situ monitoring of turbidity and fDOM were used to quantify respectively particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports at the inlet and outlet of a peatland over three years in a French Pyrenean watershed (1,343 m.a.s.l.). The DOC and POC signals are both highly dynamic, characterized by numerous short peaks lasting from a few hours to a few days. Forty-six percent of the exports occurred during 9% of the time corresponding to the highest flows monitored at the outlet. Despite its small area (3%) within the watershed, the peatland contributes at least 63% of the DOC export at the outlet. The specific DOC flux ranges from 16.1 +/- 0.4 to 34.6 +/- 1.5 g m(2) year(-1). POC contributes 17% of the total stream organic carbon exports from the watershed. As the frequency of extreme climatic events is expected to increase in the context of climate change, further studies should be conducted to understand the evolution of underestimated mountainous peatland carbon fluxes and their implication in the carbon cycle of headwaters.

DE tapping of pine; pine resin (turpentine); forest hydromelioration;

AB On the research results of 2009-2013 we conducted the closed experimental tapping in the pine forests in the forest hydromelioration stations of the Sokol district, Vologda region. The experimental pine forests were presented by the stands transformed after drainage and the pine stands after drainage and partial cutting (thinning); peat accumulation was presented by the transitional water-logging process; the pine forests belonged to the sedge-sphagnum group. Pine was dominant in a tree layer. The share of birch and spruce was less than 10 % before cutting. Our research was mainly dedicated to the approbation of the proximate method of micro wounding, used for closed rapid tapping. We offered the formula for the obtained results recalculation according to the Russian method of the resin productivity evaluation. The following research objectives were considered: to develop and adjust the proximate method of micro wounding for the resin productivity evaluation of pine stands; to define the stable and significant summer growth period of time for drained pine stands when the resin productivity is maximum; to identify the differences in pine resin exudation in different categories of objects (canalside and interchannel drained wood lines; drainage and drainage with thinning); to set the minimum research time period of the resin productivity to get the reliable results. The research results demonstrate that the proximate method of micro wounding for the shortest period of time allows us to get reliable data on the resin productivity of drained pine forests, which can serve as a general indicator of the living condition of pine trees. The 5-year observation period for drainable pine forests led to the following conclusions: the resin productivity in June is by 21 % higher than in average for the whole summer period; in the canalside drained area the turpentine yield is by 10 % more intense, than in the interchannel one; thinning affects positively as the resin productivity increases by 42 % comparing to the pine stand that was only drained. 3-year monitoring of drainable pine stands can give the most reliable results when establishing their resin productivity.

AB Concentrations and fluxes of particulate, dissolved and gaseous forms of hydrologic carbon were measured in two contrasting acidic upland streams in NE Scotland and Mid-Wales. Sampling was undertaken at the outlet of each catchment, on a weekly or biweekly basis over 2 years. In addition, spatial variations in concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC). dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), free CO2 and CH4 are presented for both streams along 14 contiguous sites between the source and the outlet of each catchment. Concentrations of carbon determinants along each stream reflected increasing inputs of TOC and gaseous forms of carbon from soil-pore water emanating from deep peat areas; these concentrations subsequently decreased downstream due to changing soil characteristics and in-stream processes.
   The total annual carbon flux was 191 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the NE Scotland site compared to 121 kg C ha(1) yr(1) from the Mid-Wales stream, mainly due to significantly higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (p < 0.001) found in the Scottish stream. DOC dominated the carbon flux at both the NE Scotland (88.4%) and Mid-Wales (69.0%) sites, reflecting the importance of organic carbon sources in both catchments. Particulate organic carbon ( 18.5 and 27.4 kg C ha(1) yr(-1) for NE Scotland and Mid-Wales, respectively), HCO3--C (1.12 and 1.28 kg C ha(1) yr(1)) and free CO2-C (2.62 and 8.75 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) also contributed to the overall carbon flux. The CH4-C flux at the outlet of each catchment was less than 0.01 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Climatic differences between the two sites were expressed in terms of significantly higher discharge and temperature, which caused an increase in CO2 and CH4 export from the warmer and wetter Mid-Wales catchment.

AB Riparian lowlands are known to control catchment nitrogen (N) balances. This study examined the role of agricultural tile drainage systems, often present in clay till landscapes, on the transport, transformation, and mass balance of N species in four riparian peat lowland transects receiving agricultural tile drainage water. Monitoring of N speciation of drain, stream, and groundwater, combined with a previously established water balance, enabled the determination of N mass balances for different flow paths including groundwater, subsurface drain water, and overland flow for each piezometer transect. The type of overland flow largely affected nitrate-N (NO3-N) removal efficiency, as determined by the total N output from a transect relative to the NO3-N loading (%). Infiltration and subsurface flow followed by exfiltration (short return flow) allowed an efficient removal of NO3-N (71-94%), while direct overland flow strongly lowered NO3-N removal (25%) in one transect. The hydraulic loading rate versus the lowland infiltration capacity determined the transport pathways and thus the resulting NO3-N removal efficiency. For all transects there was a net export of organic N and/or ammonium, associated with in situ N release from peat decomposition, through overland flow and groundwater discharge. These exports partly counterbalanced NO3-N removal and significantly reduced the overall total N removal for the riparian lowlands. However, the N removal efficiencies remained positive (1-56%). The study indicates that N budgets for riparian lowlands need to account for overland flow as a transport pathway for N.
   Key Points
   Nitrate (NO3-) removal in riparian lowlands (RLs) depends on the infiltration of NO3- into organic riparian lowland sediments. Direct overland flow, bypassing the RL soil and sediment, decreases nitrate removal. RLs may be sinks or sources of nitrogen (N) depending on the balance between removal of nitrate and release of ammonium and organic N.

AB Research on the ecosystem impacts of acidifying pollutants, and measures to control them, has focused almost exclusively on sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) compounds. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), although emitted by coal burning, has been overlooked as a driver of ecosystem change because most of it was considered to redeposit close to emission sources rather than in remote natural ecosystems. Despite receiving little regulatory attention, measures to reduce S emissions, and changes in energy supply, have led to a 95% reduction in United Kingdom HCl emissions within 20 years. Long-term precipitation, surface water, and soil solution data suggest that the near-disappearance of HCl from deposition could account for 30-40% of chemical recovery from acidification during this time, affecting both near-source and remote areas. Because HCl is highly mobile in reducing environments, it is a more potent acidifier of wetlands than S or N, and HCl may have been the major driver of past peatland acidification. Reduced HCl loadings could therefore have affected the peatland carbon cycle, contributing to increases in dissolved organic carbon leaching to surface waters. With many regions increasingly reliant on coal for power generation, HCl should be recognized as a potentially significant constituent of resulting emissions, with distinctive ecosystem impacts.

AB Rising concentrations of tropospheric ozone are having detrimental impacts on the growth of crop and forest species and some studies have reported inhibition of the allocation of carbon below ground. The effects of ozone on peatland ecosystems have received relatively little attention, despite their importance within the global carbon cycle. During this study, cores from a Welsh minerotrophic fen and ombrotrophic bog were exposed to four ambient/elevated ozone concentration regimes representing current and predicted 2050 profiles. A large and significant reduction in the concentration of porewater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was recorded in the fen cores exposed to the elevated ozone concentrations (up to -55%), with a concurrent shift to a higher molecular weight of the remaining soil carbon. No effects of ozone on DOC concentrations or characteristics were recorded for the bog cores. The data suggest higher ozone sensitivity of plants growing in the fen-type peatland, that the impacts on the vegetation may affect soil carbon characteristics through a reduction in root exudates and that there may have been a shift in the source of substrate DOC for microbial consumption from vegetation exudates to native soil carbon. There may also have been a direct effect of ozone molecules reacting with soil organic matter after being transported into the soil through the aerenchyma tissue of the overlying vegetation. These qualitative changes in the soil carbon in response to elevated ozone may have important implications for carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems, and therefore climate change.

ID INORGANIC C-14; CARBON; ROOTS
AB The storage of low level radioactive waste in trenches overlying an unconfined groundwater how system in sands has generated a contaminant plume (with chemical characteristics of dilute sanitary landfill leachate) containing C-14 both as dissolved inorganic and organic C. In the groundwater, dissolved organic compounds account, on average, for 22% of the total C and 10% of the C-14. Approximately 300 m from the waste management site, the groundwater discharges to the surface in a wetland containing up to 3 m of peat and an extensive tree cover. Drainage from the wetland passes through a gauged stream. Radiocarbon input to the groundwater discharge area in 1991 was determined to be between 3.3 and 4.2 GBq, based on data from a line of sampling wells along the groundwater input boundary of the wetland, with control provided by water and tritium balance data. During the 1991 study year, only 1.5-2% of both the inorganic and organic C-14 inputs left the wetland in surface water drainage. Vegetation growth in the wetland during the study year contained 8-10% of the released radiocarbon. If the rate of C accumulation in the peat has been constant, 7-9% of the annual radiocarbon input has been retained in the organic soil. Much of this soil accumulation can be attributed to litter from standing vegetation, making distribution coefficients an inappropriate model for C-14 partitioning between groundwater and soil. The plant/soil C-14 concentration ratio was 24 to 33, but application of a concentration ratio to describe the transfer of radiocarbon to plants is also believed to be inappropriate. This study indicates that over 80% of the groundwater radiocarbon is rapidly lost to the atmosphere when the groundwater comes to surface, and we infer that most of the C-14 accumulation in vegetation occurs by CO2 transfer from the air to the plant.

AB Uncertainty regarding changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quantity and quality has created interest in managing peatlands for their ecosystem services such as drinking water provision. The evidence base for such interventions is, however, sometimes contradictory. We performed a laboratory climate manipulation using a factorial design on two dominant peatland vegetation types (Calluna vulgaris and Sphagnum Spp.) and a peat soil collected from a drinking water catchment in Exmoor National Park, UK. Temperature and rainfall were set to represent baseline and future conditions under the UKCP09 2080s high emissions scenario for July and August. DOC leachate then underwent standard water treatment of coagulation/flocculation before chlorination. C. vulgaris leached more DOC than Sphagnum Spp. (7.17 versus 3.00 mg g(-1)) with higher specific ultraviolet (SUVA) values and a greater sensitivity to climate, leaching more DOC under simulated future conditions. The peat soil leached less DOC (0.37 mg g(-1)) than the vegetation and was less sensitive to climate. Differences in coagulation removal efficiency between the DOC sources appears to be driven by relative solubilisation of protein-like DOC, observed through the fluorescence peak C/T. Post-coagulation only differences between vegetation types were detected for the regulated disinfection by-products (DBPs), suggesting climate change influence at this scale can be removed via coagulation. Our results suggest current biodiversity restoration programmes to encourage Sphagnum Spp. will result in lower DOC concentrations and SUVA values, particularly with warmer and drier summers.

AB Terrestrial export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to watercourses has increased in boreal zone. Effect of decomposing material and soil food webs on the release rate and quality of DOC are poorly known. We quantified carbon (C) release in CO2, and DOC in different molecular weights from the most common organic soils in boreal zone; and explored the effect of soil type and enchytraeid worms on the release rates. Two types of mor and four types of peat were incubated in laboratory with and without enchytraeid worms for 154 days at + 15 A degrees C. Carbon was mostly released as CO2; DOC contributed to 2-9% of C release. The share of DOC was higher in peat than in mor. The release rate of CO2 was three times higher in mor than in highly decomposed peat. Enchytraeids enhanced the release of CO2 by 31-43% and of DOC by 46-77% in mor. High molecular weight fraction dominated the DOC release. Upscaling the laboratory results into catchment level allowed us to conclude that peatlands are the main source of DOC, low molecular weight DOC originates close to watercourse, and that enchytraeids substantially influence DOC leaching to watercourse and ultimately to aquatic CO2 emissions.

AB Heathy Spur 1 (HS-1) is an intact alpine peatland in the Bogong High Plains, Victoria, Australia, that serves as a reference system for understanding the impacts of historical land use practices (cattle grazing, water diversion) and wildfire. The major ion chemistry in the groundwater feed and drainage water at HS-1 was studied over seasonal timescales during 'dry weather' periods; conditions that allow a simple hydrological model to be used, where the groundwater is assumed to partition between evapotranspiration and stream discharge. With this model the acid neutralising capacity (ANC) of stream discharge can be understood in terms of evapotranspiration and proton uptake associated with nitrate and sulfate removal. Stream discharge ANC is strongly partitioned towards exported dissolved organic carbon, shifting the buffering intensity to lower pH compared to the groundwater. Given the extremely low alkalinity of the regional groundwater, these alpine peatlands likely have a critical role in increasing headwater stream buffering capacity.

AB I examined concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in precipitation, upland forest throughfall, stemflow and soil water, peatland pore water, beaver ponds, and streams from May to September 1994 in the BOREAS Northern Study Area, near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. Concentrations of DOC in precipitation were large (8 mg L-1) compared to other boreal locations, possibly associated with a high incidence of local forest fires. DOC concentrations increased in throughfall, stemflow, and soil organic horizons and decreased in subsoil pore water, associated with DOC sorption. Pore water of fens and bogs contained large DOC concentrations (seasonal average 20 to 40 mg L-1), similar to that observed in beaver ponds (seasonal average 19 to 38 mg L-1). Streams draining three small (30 to 420 km(2)) catchments contained DOC concentrations generally from 15 to 30 mg L-1, with a negative correlation with discharge. For the May to September period, it was estimated that precipitation imported similar to2 g DOC m(-2), increasing to 3 to 6 g DOC m(-2) with passage through forest vegetation and organic horizons. DOC export in streams was estimated to be similar to3 g DOC m(-2), controlled mainly by contributions from wetlands and beaver ponds before reaching streams. Although DOC concentrations are large, compared to other landscapes, the hydrologic pathways and the paucity of mineral subsoils for DOC sorption, and the small runoff (average 125 mm, May to September 1994 to 1996) in this continental climate (precipitation 535 mm yr(-1)) environment results in a small export of DOC from the land surface to water bodies.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in surface waters have increased across much of Europe and North America, with implications for the terrestrial carbon balance, aquatic ecosystem functioning, water treatment costs and human health. Over the past decade, many hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon, from changing climate and land management to eutrophication and acid deposition. Resolution of this debate has been hindered by a reliance on correlative analyses of time series data, and a lack of robust experimental testing of proposed mechanisms. In a 4 year, four-site replicated field experiment involving both acidifying and deacidifying treatments, we tested the hypothesis that DOC leaching was previously suppressed by high levels of soil acidity in peat and organo-mineral soils, and therefore that observed DOC increases a consequence of decreasing soil acidity. We observed a consistent, positive relationship between DOC and acidity change at all sites. Responses were described by similar hyperbolic relationships between standardized changes in DOC and hydrogen ion concentrations at all sites, suggesting potentially general applicability. These relationships explained a substantial proportion of observed changes in peak DOC concentrations in nearby monitoring streams, and application to a UK-wide upland soil pH dataset suggests that recovery from acidification alone could have led to soil solution DOC increases in the range 46126% by habitat type since 1978. Our findings raise the possibility that changing soil acidity may have wider impacts on ecosystem carbon balances. Decreasing sulphur deposition may be accelerating terrestrial carbon loss, and returning surface waters to a natural, high-DOC condition.

AB The turnover of organic carbon in rivers could represent a large source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and studies have suggested that of the order of 70% of the dissolved organic carbon exported from soils could be lost in rivers before it flows to continental seas. The Environmental Change Network (ECN) monitoring of the dominantly peat-covered Trout Beck catchment within the Moor House site enabled the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lost within a stream over a 20-year period to be estimated. The study compared DOC concentrations of precipitation, shallow and deep soil waters with those at the catchment outlet. The mass balance between source and outlet was reconstructed by two methods: a single conservative tracer; and based upon a principal component analysis (PCA) using multiple tracers. The study showed the two methods had different outcomes, with the PCA showing a DOC gain and the single tracer showing a DOC loss. The DOC gain was attributed to an unmeasured groundwater contribution that dominates when the river discharge is lower. The DOC loss was related to the in-stream residence time, the soil temperature and month of the year, with longer in-stream residence times, warmer soils and summer months having larger DOC losses. The single tracer study suggested a 10 year average loss of 8.77 g Cm-2 year(-1), which is 33.1 g CO2eq m(-2) year(-1), or 29% of the DOC flux from the source over a mean in-stream residence time of 4.33 h.

AB The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) and water table draw-down on soil carbon sequestration in an ombrotrophic bog ecosystem were examined. Peat monoliths (11 cm diameter, 25 cm deep) with intact bog vegetation were exposed to ambient or elevated (ambient + 200 mg l(-1)) atmospheric CO2, combined with a natural water table (level with the peat surface) or a water table draw-down (-5 cm). Eight observations per treatment were included in the study, which was conducted over a 12 week period. Concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phenolic compounds and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were measured. The eCO(2) treatment caused an increase in the CH4 and CO2 fluxes and a small decrease in both the DOC and phenolic concentrations. The water table draw-down invoked decreases in phenolic and DOC concentrations, a decrease in CH4 flux and a small increase in CO2 flux. The combined (eCO(2) + water table draw-down) treatment caused a larger than expected CH4 flux decrease and CO2 flux increase and an increase in DOC concentration. Our results suggest very different effects on the system dependent on the treatment applied. The draw-down treatment principally increased oxidation of the rhizosphere resulting in increased decomposition and as such a removal of material from the dissolved carbon pool. The data also suggest labile carbon availability may be limiting the rate of decomposition and so slowing inorganic nutrient and carbon pool turn-over. The elevated CO2 addressed the labile-carbon limitation. Under the environment of the combined treatment, these limitations were effectively removed, culminating in a destabilisation of the carbon-sequestering environment to a weaker sink (or even a source) of atmospheric carbon.

AB Thaw of frozen peat in discontinuous permafrost zone produces a significant number of thermokarst lakes, which are known to contribute to Green House Gases (GHG) emission in the atmosphere. In palsa peatland of western Siberia, the thermokarst lake formation includes soil subsidences, lichen submergence and peat abrasion, leading to lateral spreading of the lake border, often intensified by ground fires. Mesocosm experiments were conducted during 3 weeks on tWo thermokarst lake waters interacting in 30-L tanks with surface horizon of peat, the dominant ground vegetation (lichen Cladonia sp.) and the ash produced by lichen burning at 450 C. The obtained results allowed a better understanding of physico-chemical factors controlling the enrichment of thermokarst lake water in organic carbon and metals, and evaluating CO2 sequestration/emission potential. The changes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), major element and divalent metal concentration in response to peat and lichen biomass addition were less than a factor of 2 over full duration of the experiment. Iron (Fe) concentration in the lake water decreased by a factor of 2 to 3 after the addition of peat and lichen biomass. The concentration of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates decreased by ca. 30 to 50%, presumably due to their co-precipitation with Fe hydroxide. The dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in tank with lichen increased by a factor of 5.5 0.5, likely due to respiration of algal component in closed environment Strong enrichment of the lake water in DIC, P, K, Ca, Mg, Si, Al, Ti, Mn, Mo, Rb, As, Sb and U upon the ash addition persisted over full duration of experiments and was significant (p <0.0001) compared to peat and lichen biomass treatments. These elements may serve as indicators of ground fire impact on thermokarst lake water's chemistry. The overall effect of ash leaching on aquatic ecosystems after ground fire of frozen Siberian peatland is predicted to be much stronger than that currently recognized for non-permafrost regions.

AB Changes of water table position influence carbon cycling in peatlands, but effects on the sources and sinks of carbon are difficult to isolate and quantify in field investigations due to seasonal dynamics and covariance of variables. We thus investigated carbon fluxes and dissolved carbon production in peatland mesocosms from two acidic and oligotrophic peatlands under steady state conditions at two different water table positions. Exchange rates and CO2, CH4 and DOC production rates were simultaneously determined in the peat from diffusive-advective mass-balances of dissolved CO2, CH4 and DOC in the pore water. Incubation experiments were used to quantify potential CO 2, CH4, and DOC production rates. The carbon turnover in the saturated peat was dominated by the production of DOC (10 - 15 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) with lower rates of DIC (6.1 - 8.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and CH4 (2.2 - 4.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) production. All production rates strongly decreased with depth indicating the importance of fresh plant tissue for dissolved C release. A lower water table decreased area based rates of photosynthesis (24 - 42%), CH4 production ( factor 2.5 - 3.5) and emission, increased rates of soil respiration and microbial biomass C, and did not change DOC release. Due to the changes in process rates the C net balance of the mesocosms shifted by 36 mmol m(-2) d(-1). According to our estimates the change in C mineralization contributed most to this change. Anaerobic rates of CO2 production rates deeper in the peat increased significantly by a factor of 2 - 3.5 ( DOC), 2.9 - 3.9 (CO2), and 3 - 14 (CH4) when the water table was lowered by 30 cm. This phenomenon might have been caused by easing an inhibiting effect by the accumulation of CO2 and CH4 when the water table was at the moss surface.

AB Our study investigated the concentration of dissolved carbon at the point when water leaves the pedosphere and whether this amount represents a significant proportion of terrestrial carbon cycling. The investigations were carried out in a temperate forest catchment (Black Forest, Germany) over a period of I year. The annual export of dissolved C compounds (14.4 g C m(-2) year I) was dominated by CO2 (9.7 vs. 4.7 g C m(-2) year(-1) DOC). Even though the direct CO2 degassing at the spring was inferior (0.4 kg C year(-1)), considerably lower CO2 concentrations were measured 17 m downstream of the spring. This shows that a large proportion of dissolved CO2 (93%) originating from the pedosphere is not captured anymore within a short distance from the spring. The measured lateral C-transport was in the same order of magnitude as reported for the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) observed for German spruce forests (-4 to -55 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Therefore, the results clearly demonstrated that the lateral transport of dissolved carbon can be a significant part of terrestrial carbon budgets and for this study site CO2 was dominating this 'indirect' pathway. However, for generalisation, it is important to extend this investigation to other landscapes and climatic zones. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Diel variation in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within lotic systems has been reported on numerous occasions. However, to our knowledge there has been no published work on diel DOC variation within lowland rivers during high flow events. We sampled DOC at 4 h intervals from two sites across two distinct flow regimes in the regulated lower Namoi River, Australia. This included a large flood (mean flow 224 m(3) s(-1) and a peak flow of 376 m(3) s(-1)) sampled every 4 h for 10 consecutive days. DOC concentrations were significantly greater at night than during the day (P < 0.05) and the mean DOC concentration was 23.4 mg L-1 at night compared to 18.9 mg L-1 during daylight hours. The magnitude and duration of flow within this lowland river system and the mobilisation of large quantities of allochthonous carbon appeared to play a role in increasing DOC concentration and the diel difference.

ID MATTER FLUORESCENCE; PEATLAND; CYCLE; RIVER; SOIL
AB Radiocarbon analysis of freshwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) involves substantial sample pretreatment, including an initial rotary evaporation stage necessary to concentrate large volumes of freshwater sample. This may lead to a health risk from the exposure to pathogens, and there is the additional concern that the warm conditions during the rotary evaporation stage may provide ideal growing conditions for some pathogens. To remove any pathogen risk in water samples, boiling or autoclaving can be undertaken. However, to date, no studies have been undertaken to investigate whether boiling will alter the C-14 signature of dissolved organic carbon. Here, we analyze the effect of sterilization on 9 contrasting river water samples. Comparing filtered, filtered and boiled, and filtered and sterilized dissolved organic matter, we observe that both boiling and autoclaving increases the uncertainty associated with the C-14 and C-13 of DOC, that the C-14 and C-13 changes are not unidirectional, and that they are not related to original DOC composition. Neither sterilization method is recommended unless essential, in which instance we recommend a 3. uncertainty on C-14 and that the C-13 is not considered representative of the original sample.

AB Fen peatlands cover a large proportion of the landscape in boreal Alberta and thus these ecosystems are likely to be constructed as part of mine closure following oil sands mining. Peatlands are large sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC); however, little is known about DOC dynamics in constructed peatlands. We investigated DOC production and its bioavailability from substrates collected from a constructed fen and natural fens (reference ecosystems) in the Athabasca oil sands region near Fort McMurray, Alberta. Dominant vegetation and other substrates used in fen construction, like peat, petroleum coke, tailings sand and upland soil, were collected for the study. The effect of substrate type, salinity and temperature on DOC production and bioavailability were analyzed in a laboratory incubation study. Sedges and trees produced the largest amount of DOC, followed by peat and moss in all the fens, whereas the substrates from the constructed fen such as petroleum coke, tailings sand and upland soil produced very little DOC per unit dry mass. In addition, temperature and salinity were also significant explanatory variables for both initial (30 day) and final (60 day) net DOC production rates. It was also observed that greater production of DOC resulted in lower pH and higher electrical conductivity (EC) in incubation jar water. In addition, the quality of DOC depended upon the type of substrate. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm wavelength (SUVA(254)) indicated that sedges produced DOC having less aromatic humic substances than peat, tailings sand, upland soil and petroleum coke. Substrate, salinity and temperature at which DOC was produced, and interactions among these factors were all found to significantly explain variation in DOC bioavailability. Aromatic content of DOC produced, based on SUVA(254), had an effect on its bioavailability. As various substrates produced different amounts and quality of DOC, and since construction material like petroleum coke and tailings sand produce very little DOC, it is likely that establishment of the vegetation community and its composition will play an important role in DOC dynamics at the constructed fen in the future.

AB Carbon accumulation and storage is a defining characteristic of peatland ecosystems. Decomposition of peat releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to receiving waters and can be an important fraction of the peatland carbon budget, along with being an important modifier of downstream water quality. Changes in temperature and hydrological processes under future climate scenarios are expected to impact decomposition processes in peatlands with unclear ramifications for both the quantity and the quality of the DOC released. We experimentally examined the individual and interactive effects of increased temperature, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and lower water table position on peatland decomposition and the quantity and quality of porewater DOC in intact, replicated peat monoliths in a full factorial design. Decomposition rates and porewater DOC concentrations significantly increased under elevated temperature conditions; however, the quality of this carbon was variable, showing signs of both increased lability and recalcitrance. Lowered water table treatments also increased decomposition rates, although the high water conditions prompted greater porewater DOC concentrations and lability. It is expected that elevated decomposition rates under future climate scenarios will alter porewater DOC quantity in peatlands; however, we suggest that contributions from the aboveground system are needed to fully understand changes in DOC quality and subsequent ecosystem dynamics.

AB We have reconstructed the altitudinal position of the upper forest line (UFL) during the last 6000 years. This boundary between montane forest and paramo (tropical alpine grasslands) has important ecological and societal relevance. It is suggested that human-induced fires and deforestation during the long occupation history of the Central Valley of Ecuador have caused a downslope shift of the UFL and have given way to a downslope expansion of paramo vegetation. More recently, montane forests and lower paramo have been replaced to a large extent by agricultural land. Pollen analysis of a 90 cm long sediment core G15-II from a small mire at 3400 m elevation, 200 m below the actual UFL in Guandera Biological Reserve (0 degrees 36' N, 77 degrees 42'E), shows the altitudinal position of the UFL during seven discrete intervals: (1) from 7150 to 6240 cal. yr BP the UFL was at c. 3100-3200 m and climatic conditions were cool; (2) from 6240 to 5320 cal. yr BP the UFL shifted to c. 3600 m and upper montane rainforest (UMRF) surrounded the mire; (3) from 5320 to 2160 cal. yr BP the UFL was at 3600-3650 m elevation and montane forest consisted mainly of Hedyosmum, Weinmannia, Melastomataceae, Ilex, Scrophulariaceae and Symplocos; (4) from 2160 to 910 cal. yr BP the UFL shifted downslope to 3350 m and the mire was located in the lowermost paramo; (5) from 910 to 520 cal. yr BP cooler climatic conditions prevailed and the UFL was at 3250-3300 m; (6) since c. 520 cal. yr BP the UFL has shifted upslope to 3600 m. During this period presence of agricultural weeds (Rumex) and evidence of draining and disturbance of the mire indicate that agricultural activities expanded and almost reached the reserve area; (7) during the last 150 cal. yr disturbance increased. We conclude that during the last 6000 years the UFL reached a maximum altitude of 3650 to 3700 m, indicating that paramo grasslands above this elevation represent a natural ecosystem. Under the Kyoto Protocol-driven reforestation activities, trees should be planted up to a maximum of 3700 m. Planting trees (exotic species in particular) above 3700 m would contribute to the degradation of the natural ecosystem.

TI Middle to Late Holocene landscape changes and geoarchaeological

AB Holocene palaeogeographic changes in the lower Dives valley, a small estuarine system in Normandy, France, have been investigated using a combination of facies interpretation from borehole cores, C-14 dating and pollen analysis. The palaeoenvironmental record is broadly similar to that of other coastal and estuarine systems along the English Channel but exhibits specific features in comparison with large estuarine and coastal systems, especially as regards the narrow lower valley and its margins. The identified environments included uniform tidal (6800-5500, 2200-2000 cal. BP), freshwater fen (5500-3300 cal. BP), and drained floodplain (300-0 cal. BP). In contrast, landscape variability was high during the periods 3300-2300 and 1900-300 cal. BP in relation to gradients in environmental conditions from downstream to the upper reaches of the valley. A significant palaeogeographic change between ca. 3000 and 2200 cal. BP indicates that episodes of strong coastal hydrodynamic forcing, notably storm events, may have had dramatic consequences, with significant implications for human activities. The pollen diagrams show evidence of the opening up of woodland in order to develop pastures and agriculture on the edges of the freshwater marsh during the Bronze Age (4500-2800 cal. BP), although the settlement patterns remain unknown because of the sparse archaeological discoveries related to this period. During the Iron Age, increased land use in the valley bottom had a significant impact on the environment. From the Iron Age to the Late Roman period (2800-1500 cal. BP), the dramatic change caused by marine flooding and the large size of the tidal environment favoured the development of salt extraction sites from the coast to the inner estuary. From the Early Middle Ages, restricted tidal influences and the progressive silting of the valley bottom by overbank deposits enabled a lasting change, with the development of pastureland and the miscellaneous exploitation of the various environments. Finally, after the 17th century, the systematic reclamation and drainage of the wetland produced marked changes, inducing, in particular, a significant loss of landscape and ecological diversity. In this regard, the pattern of land use in the Middle Ages probably represents an example of sustainable landscape exploitation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the spatio-temporal variability of controls on peatland carbon (C) cycling is essential to project the effects of future environmental change. While there is understanding of individual drivers of C cycling, the effect of multiple drivers, including interactions, remains poorly understood. Using a spatially and temporally explicit sampling framework, we examined the effects of biotic and abiotic controls on key indicators of peatland functioning: ecosystem respiration (R (eco)), photosynthesis (P (cal)), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), methane (CH4) fluxes, and pore water dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]). Measurements were made over 12 months in a blanket peatland hosting a wind farm in Scotland, UK. Overall, we found that (i) season and plant functional type (PFT) explained most variation in R (eco) and P (cal), (ii) PFT and spatial location within the wind farm, which integrates several peat properties, were dominant predictors of CH4 fluxes, and (iii) season and location within the wind farm correlated with pore water [DOC]. Examination of predictors indicated that interactions, between and within biotic and abiotic factors, explained a significant amount of variation in greenhouse gas fluxes and [DOC]. These findings indicate that combinations of biotic and abiotic factors could mediate or exacerbate the effects of future environmental change on peatland C cycling. Given this, studies of C cycling need to capture the spatial and temporal variance of biotic and abiotic factors and their interactions to project the likely impacts of environmental change.

AB This study presents the carbon budget of a blanket bog, North Pennines, UK, subject to grazing and prescribed burning for vegetation management. The budget considers both fluvial and gaseous carbon fluxes and the following uptake and release pathways: dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, excess dissolved CO2, release of methane (CH4), net ecosystem respiration of CO2, and uptake of CO2 through primary productivity. Measurements of CH4 were not directly measured as part of this study but were estimated from hydroclimatic variables measured within the study. The results show that, if management combinations were extrapolated across the catchment, then over a 3 year period, the catchment would be a net source of carbon of between 62 and 206 gC m (2) yr (1). The action of both burning and grazing was to significantly decrease the magnitude of the carbon source relative to unburnt controls. Over the study period burnt sites were a mean source of approximately 117.8 gC m(-2) yr(-1) compared to unburnt sites with a mean source of 156.7 gC m(-2) yr(-1). Even when including the loss of carbon during the vegetation combustion, there are conditions under which the long-term loss of carbon is less than if no burning had occurred. If total combustion of vegetation occurs, provided burning occurs at cycles longer than 32 years, then less carbon is predicted to be lost than in a no-burn scenario.

Much of the literature has been from catchments with organo-mineral soils, with fewer studies from upland peat sites. We used high-frequency fluorescence data, a proxy for DOC, to investigate 1. the relationship between stream discharge and concentration in a blanket peat catchment during extreme high flows and 2. the relationship between inflow and in-lake estimated DOC concentrations. We found that for approximately two thirds of extreme events, there was a decrease in stream DOC concentration (i.e., a dilution) on the rising limb rather than an increase (i.e., a flushing out of DOC from terrestrial stores). Flushing events dominated only in summer when concentrations in the stream were also increasing. In comparison to the stream, concentrations in the downstream lake were less variable, and peaks and troughs were damped and lagged. Replicating these patterns and processes in DOC models would be critical in order to provide appropriate simulations in response to shorter- and longer-term changes in climate, and thus inform future catchment and lake management.

AB Fluvial systems are increasingly recognised as sites of carbon processing, particularly in peatlands, where high quantities of particulate organic carbon (POC) enter the stream network during storm events. However, the fate of this POC and potential transformations to dissolved and gaseous phases are poorly understood. Here, a series of mixing experiments are undertaken, using particulate organic matter (POM) and streamwater derived from an eroding peat catchment to simulate high quantities of material entering the fluvial system during storm event. Solutions were monitored for CO2 release and changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. The role of microbial versus physical processes, and the influence of the initial streamwater pH and DOC concentration were also investigated. Results show that the addition of POM to the system leads to high rates of CO2 release, particularly within the first 24 h. The key control on rates of CO2 release is the initial DOC concentration of the streamwater used, with highest rates of CO2 release from solutions with the lowest initial DOC concentration. Rates of DOC production were lower, with average increases in the region of 0.8 mg/l over 24 h. There is evidence to suggest that rates of DOC increase are also influenced by initial streamwater DOC. The rapid rates of CO2 release from the fluvial system indicate that significant carbon loss to the atmosphere is possible, representing 'hot moments' upon the addition of POC to the fluvial system, whereas locations where POC residence times are long will be 'hot spots' of carbon transformation.

TI DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON AND METHANE IN A REGIONAL CONFINED AQUIFER,

   SUBSURFACE SOURCES
SO APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Information regarding the origin, composition and transport of natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater is necessary to understand the transport of metals and organic pollutants, as well as for the use of C-14 in DOC as an isotopic groundwater dating method. Previous research in several groundwater systems has suggested soil organic C is the predominant source of high molecular weight DOC to the subsurface. Through the use of stable isotopes, C-14 and geochemical analyses, this study shows that significant concentrations of DOC and CH4 in a regional confined aquifer can be generated in situ from subsurface sedimentary organic sources. The DOC and CH4 produced is a combined result of degradation of buried peats and bacterial action, resulting in high DOC concentrations and strongly methanogenic conditions in the aquifer. The DOC and CH4 comprise, on average, nearly 50% of the total dissolved C pool in the central part of the aquifer. Methanogenic conditions complicate isotopic groundwater dating by the conventional dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) method. Estimates of isotopic groundwater residence times using DOC C-14 data are proposed by the application of C-14 isotope and mass balance corrections.

AB Electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) was used to identify the qualitative differences between dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fen and bog porewaters from the Red Lake II system in the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands (CLAP) of northern Minnesota. Approximately 80% of the molecular composition in surface porewater was maintained throughout the upper portion of the bog profile (0.17-2.50 m). The qualitative stability of the composition of the DOM was accompanied by a quantitative increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with depth. The composition of DOM in the fen was significantly different at depth, with slightly varying DOC levels. Aromaticity index (AI) values were used to identify condensed aromatic and phenol-type compounds in the porewater of both peatlands. Surface bog and deep fen DOM had surprisingly similar molecular composition. Differences in enzymatic degradation rates via phenol oxidase in the bog and surface fen horizons, slower transport down the bog vertical profile and the presence of a stratum of Sphagnum-woody peat at depth in the fen are suggested as being responsible for the observed variations in DOM composition.

AB Organic matter can play an important role in the mobility and fate of As in the environment, but there is a lack of data on As biogeochemistry in ombrotrophic peatlands. The aim of this study was to investigate As retention and release in atmospheric ally contaminated ombrotrophic peat soils in the Peak District National Park (UK). Solid phase As concentrations in the peat soils exceed 25 mg kg(-1). Solid phase As and Fe concentrations are closely correlated at sites where the peat is subjected to drying and oxic conditions. in a wetter zone of the bog, solid phase As and Fe distributions are decoupled, suggesting that As retention in these systems is not solely controlled by the presence of Fe oxides. Comparison of solid phase As and Pb distributions reveals that As has been subjected to post-depositional mobility in areas of water table fluctuation. Conversely, at permanently waterlogged locations As is immobile. Detailed stream water sampling reveals that As is released from the organic-rich uplands soils into the fluvial system. Dissolved As concentrations are highly variable, with values ranging from 0.20 to 7.28 mu g l(-1). Stream water As concentrations are elevated during late summer storm flow periods when there has been re-wetting of the peat after significant water table draw-down. Dissolved As is strongly correlated to dissolved organic carbon under stormflow and baseflow. The results of this study suggest that organic matter plays an important role in As dynamics in ombrotrophic peatlands, but further work is needed to identify the exact As binding and release mechanisms. Drying and re-wetting of ombrotrophic peat soils and associated changes in redox status has the potential to lead to increased As mobility. Further work is needed to provide information on how predicted climate change will influence As cycling at sites containing a legacy of atmospheric contamination. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Potential rates of methane production and carbon dioxide production were measured on 11 dates in 1986 in peat from six plant communities typical of moss-dominated peatlands in the Appalachian Mountains. Annual methane production ranged from 2.7 to 17.5 mol m(-2), and annual carbon dioxide production ranged from 30.6 to 79.0 mol m(-2). The wide range in methane production values among the communities found within a single peatland indicates that obtaining one production value for a peatland may not be appropriate. Low temperature constrained the potential for methane production in winter, while the chemical quality of the peat substrate appears to control methane production in the summer. Methane oxidation was measured throughout the peat profile to a depth of 30 cm. Values for methane oxidation ranged from 0.08 to 18.7 uM h(-1) among the six plant communities. Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria probably mediated most of the activity. On a daily basis during the summer, between 11 and 100% of the methane produced is susceptible to oxidation within the peat column. Pools of dissolved methane and dissolved carbon dioxide in pore waters were less than 0.2 and less than 1.0 mol m(-2), respectively, indicating that methane does not accumulate in the pore waters. Peatlands have been considered as an important source of biologically produced methane. Despite the high rates of methane production, the high rates of methane oxidation dampen the potential emission of methane to the atmosphere.

AB The effect of tree (lodgepole pine) planting with and without intensive drainage on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes was assessed after 45 yr at a raised peatbog in West Flanders Moss, central Scotland. Fluxes of CO2 CH4 and N2O from the soil were monitored over a 2-yr period every 2 to 4 weeks using the static opaque chamber method in a randomised experimental block trial with the following treatments: drained and planted (DP), undrained and planted (uDP), undrained and unplanted (uDuP) and for reference also from an adjoining near-pristine area of bog at East Flanders Moss (n-pris). There was a strong seasonal pattern in both CO2 and CH4 effluxes which were significantly higher in late spring and summer months because of warmer temperatures. Effluxes of N2O were low and no significant differences were observed between the treatments. Annual CH4 emissions increased with the proximity of the water table to the soil surface across treatments in the order: DP < uDP < uDuP < n-pris with mean annual effluxes over the 2-yr monitoring period of 0.15, 0.64, 7.70 and 22.63 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. For CO2, effluxes increased in the order uDP < DP < npris < uDuP, with mean annual effluxes of 1.23, 1.66, 1.82 and 2.55 kgCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. CO2 effluxes dominated the total net GHG emission, calculated using the global warming potential (GWP) of the three GHGs for each treatment (76-98 %), and only in the n-pris site was CH4 a substantial contribution (23 %). Based on soil effluxes only, the near pristine (n-pris) peatbog had 43% higher total net GHG emission compared with the DP treatment because of high CH4 effluxes and the DP treatment had 33% higher total net emission compared with the uDP because drainage increased CO2 effluxes. Restoration is likely to increase CH4 emissions, but reduce CO2 effluxes. Our study suggests that if estimates of CO2 uptake by vegetation from similar peatbog sites were included, the total net GHG emission of restored peatbog would still be higher than that of the peatbog with trees.

AB A simple and quick method using high performance liquid chromatography is presented to determine hydrophobic organic compounds in aqueous solutions containing dissolved organic carbon. The analytical procedure does not require an extraction or purification step unlike conventional analytical approaches. It was used to measure the water solubility of dibenzofuran (4.55 mg l(-1)), acenaphthene (3.30 mg l(-1)), fluoranthene (0.23 mg l(-1)) and 4-chlorobiphenyl (1.47 mg l(-1)). The results were compared with those obtained by gas chromatographic quantification. The method was applied successfully to the direct determination of the water solubility of these compounds in the presence of DOC. In a solution of Aldrich humic acid, the water solubility of dibenzofuran, acenaphthene and 4-chlorobiphenyl increased linearly with increasing DOC concentration. The water extractable organic matter from peat led to a smaller solubility of dibenzofuran comparing to the Aldrich humic acid in the same concentration range of DOC. (C) 1989 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Peatlands are a globally significant store of carbon. During the second half of the 20th century new planting techniques combined with tax incentives encouraged commercial forestry across large areas of peat bog in the UK, particularly in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. Such planting was controversial and was ultimately halted by removal of the tax incentives, and policies to prevent new planting. Here we review the literature on UK peatland afforestation in relation to carbon and climate implications, and identify key issues for future research. The effects of conifer planting on peat bog carbon storage in the UK are poorly understood. A large body of research on peatland forestry exists, particularly from naturally forested fen peatlands in Fennoscandia and Russia, but the different conditions in the UK mean that results are not directly transferable. Data on the responses of UK peat bogs to afforestation are required to address this shortfall. Studies are required that quantify the loss of carbon from the peat and evaluate it against the accumulation of carbon above and below ground in trees, considering the likely residence time of carbon in wood products.

AB Using data from a single upland peat catchment ( North Pennines, UK), this study combines descriptions of the uptake of carbon by primary productivity and input from both wet and dry deposition with descriptions of carbon release pathways: soil CO2 respiration, CH4 flux, particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and excess dissolved CO2. Each pathway is projected 10 years into the future based upon extrapolated changes in rainfall and temperature. The study shows that the catchment is presently a net source of carbon and that over a period of 10 years the catchment goes from a net source of 11.2 to 20.9 gC/m(2)/year. The probability that the catchment is a net sink of carbon decreases from 35 to 26% over the study period, i.e. upland peats are predicted to become an increasing source of carbon. With respect to carbon gases (CO2 + CH4), the catchment remains a net sink but this decreases from 15.9 to 11.2 gC/m2/year, given current trends the catchment will become a net source of carbon gases by 2034. For most pathways the predicted increases or decreases are in line with increasing temperature predicted for the area, but DOC flux shows a larger percentage increase because of additional production caused by the increased frequency of severe droughts within the catchment. If this result is extended across the UK uplands, peats would be a net source of between 0.26 and 0.45 Mt C/year, but with respect to carbon gases alone the catchment is net sink of between 0.35 and 0.23 Mt C/year.

TI Evasion of CO2 from streams - The dominant component of the carbon

AB Evasion of gaseous carbon (C) from streams is often poorly quantified in landscape C budgets. Even though the potential importance of the capillary network of streams as C conduits across the landwateratmosphere interfaces is sometimes mentioned, low-order streams are often left out of budget estimates due to being poorly characterized in terms of gas exchange and even areal surface coverage. We show that evasion of C is greater than all the total dissolved C (both organic and inorganic) exported downstream in the waters of a boreal landscape. In this study evasion of carbon dioxide (CO2) from running waters within a 67km2 boreal catchment was studied. During a 4year period (20062009) 13 streams were sampled on 104 different occasions for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). From a locally determined model of gas exchange properties, we estimated the daily CO2 evasion with a high-resolution (5x5m) grid-based stream evasion model comprising the entire 100km stream network. Despite the low areal coverage of stream surface, the evasion of CO2 from the stream network constituted 53% (5.0 (+/- 1.8) gCm-2yr-1) of the entire stream C flux (9.6 (+/- 2.4) gCm-2yr-1) (lateral as DIC, DOC, and vertical as CO2). In addition, 72% of the total CO2 loss took place already in the first- and second-order streams. This study demonstrates the importance of including CO2 evasion from low-order boreal streams into landscape C budgets as it more than doubled the magnitude of the aquatic conduit for C from this landscape. Neglecting this term will consequently result in an overestimation of the terrestrial C sink strength in the boreal landscape.

AB AimsNorthern peatlands store large amounts of soil organic carbon (C) that can be very sensitive to ongoing global warming. Recently it has been shown that temperature-enhanced growth of vascular plants in these typically moss-dominated ecosystems may promote microbial peat decomposition by increased C input via root exudates. To what extent different plant functional types (PFT) and soil temperature interact in controlling root C input is still unclear. In this study we explored how root C input is related to the presence of ericoid shrubs (shrubs) and graminoid sedges (sedges) by means of a factorial plant clipping experiment (= PFT effect) in two peatlands located at different altitude (= temperature effect).MethodsBy selective clipping of shrub and sedge shoots in mixed vegetation at two Alpine peatland sites we interrupted the above- to belowground translocation of C, thus temporarily inhibiting root C release. Subsequent measurements of soil respiration, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and stable isotope composition (C-13) of DOC in pore water were used as proxies to estimate the above- to belowground transfer of C by different PFT.ResultsWe found that soil respiration rates and DOC concentrations temporarily decreased within 24h after clipping, with the decrease in soil respiration being most pronounced at the 1.4 degrees C warmer peatland after clipping shrubs. The transient drop in DOC concentration coincided with a shift towards a heavier C isotope signature, indicating that the decrease was associated with inhibition of a light C source that we attribute to root exudates. Together these results imply that shrubs translocated more C into the peat than sedges, particularly at higher temperature.ConclusionsWe showed that plant functional type and temperature interact in controlling root C input under field conditions in peatlands. Our results provide a mechanistic evidence that shrubs may potentially promote the release of stored soil C through root-derived C input.

AB Rainfall events have been reported of great influence on concentration and flux of aquatic organic carbon, but little is known in ditch water of peatlands. In this work we chose a ditch located in a peatland of Zoige Basin in northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and studied the response of organic carbon (in dissolved form (DOC) and in particulate form (POC)) to rainfall events with varying intensity. Organic carbon dynamics during four rainfall events were recorded in the growing season of 2016. During events, evident but different trends in both POC and DOC were observed. POC steeply increased through the rising limb of the hydrograph to maximum concentrations following the discharge peaks and followed by steep decrease, while dilution effect on DOC was observed. Different temporal patterns between POC and DOC indicated that they were transported through different flow paths. The dilution in DOC was attributed to rainwater mixing with overland flow induced by infiltration excess runoff, rainwater directly fell into the ditch and mixed with ditch water, and sampling uncertainties. Rainfall intensity had strong influence on organic carbon. The higher rainfall intensity, the higher fluctuation and higher maximum value as well as mean value of POC/DOC concentration. The investigation of the response of organic carbon to rainfall events and the mechanisms responsible is important for assessing impacts on peatland ecosystem processes.

AB Natural open-water pools are a common feature of northern peatlands and are known to be an important source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Pool environmental variables, particularly water chemistry, vegetation community and physical characteristics, have the potential to exert strong controls on carbon cycling in pools. A total of 66 peatland pools were studied across three regions of the UK (northern Scotland, south-west Scotland, and Northern Ireland). We found that within-region variability of pool water chemistry was low; however, for many pool variables measured there were significant differences between regions. PCA analysis showed that pools in SW Scotland were strongly associated with greater vegetative cover and shallower water depth which is likely to increase dissolved organic carbon (DOC) mineralisation rates, whereas pools in N Scotland were more open and deeper. Pool water DOC, particulate organic carbon and dissolved CH4 concentrations were significantly different between regions. Pools in Northern Ireland had the highest concentrations of DOC (mean=14.5 mg L-1) and CH4 (mean=20.6 mu g CL-1). Chloride and sulphate concentrations were significantly higher in the pools in N Scotland (mean values 26.3 and 2.40 mg L-1, respectively) than elsewhere, due to a stronger marine influence. The ratio of UV absorbance at 465 nmto absorbance at 665 nm for pools in Northern Ireland indicated that DOC was sourced from poorly humified peat, potentially increasing the bioavailability and mineralisation of organic carbon in pools compared to the pools elsewhere. This study, which specifically aims to address a lack of basic biogeochemical knowledge about pool water chemistry, clearly shows that peatland pools are highly regionally variable. This is likely to be a reflection of significant regional-scale differences in peatland C cycling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Long-term studies were conducted on the polymictic Siemianowka reservoir (SR), situated in a seminatural forest-peat catchment in NE Poland. The studies were started on the second year of the reservoir's existence. The records showed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations gradually increasing up to 25... 30 mg/L. The largest DOC pool in the reservoir comes from the spring load input, supplemented by the excessive development of phytoplankton with cyanobacteria dominance. The DOC limited the range of the photic zone, eliminated the occurrence of aquatic plants, and was a significant carrier of nutrients, which were gradually released to water, bringing about the "humoeutrophication" of the reservoir.

AB Over a period of 18 months, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of a series of four lakes in North Wales was measured monthly. The lake catchment profiles consisted of an upland thin peat/soil (Llyn Cwellyn), an upland thin peat/soil associated with an adjacent area of small bog (Llyn Teyrn), an upland blanket bog (Llyn Conwy), and large lowland fen and fertile agricultural area (Llyn Cefni). The results examine the indirect effect of temperature and precipitation on the DOC concentrations found in the lakes fed by the catchments. The lowest DOC of the four sites was observed for Llyn Teyrn, varying from 1.2 to 3.30mg/L, and with the highest being recorded for Llyn Cefni (5.4510.83mg/L). Temperature and rainfall data were both collected. Correlations with the DOC exhibited significant relationships with temperature for three of the sampled lakes Cwellyn (r 0.490), Teyrn (r 0.640) and Cefni (r 0.472). Recomputation versus 30- and 60-day temperature lag times improved the correlation coefficients. The data showed weak and insignificant correlations for DOC versus rainfall for the three lakes, but the upland lake, Llyn Conwy, with its blanket bog catchment, did not demonstrate any statistical correlation with temperature, although it did show a significant correlation for DOC versus rainfall (r 0.553, P<0.05). Over the sampling period, although tentative relationships were found among temperature, rainfall and DOC levels, an indirect association tempered by site hydrology is suggested.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a key role in the peatland carbon balance and serves numerous ecological and chemical functions including acting as a microbial substrate. In this study, we quantify the concentration, biodegradability, and intrinsic properties of DOC obtained from peat, fresh material, and litter from nine species of ombrotrophic bog vegetation. Potential biodegradability was assessed by incubating vegetation extracts for 28 days in the dark and measuring percent DOC loss as the fraction of biodegradable DOC (%BDOC) while DOC properties were characterized using UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence measurements. The mean initial DOC concentration extracted differed significantly among species (P < 0.05) and was significantly higher in fresh material, 217 +/- 259 mg DOC l(-1), than either litter or peat extracts with mean concentrations of 82.1 +/- 117 mg DOC l(-1) and 12.7 +/- 1.0 mg DOC l(-1), respectively (P < 0.05). %BDOC also differed significantly among species (P < 0.05) and ranged from 52 to 73% in fresh cuttings with the greatest fraction observed in S. magellanicum; 22-46% in litter; and 24% in peat. The majority of variability (82.5%) in BDOC was explained by initial absorbance at 254 nm and total dissolved nitrogen concentration which was further resolved into significant non-linear relationships between %BDOC and both humic-like and protein-like DOC fractions (P < 0.05). Our results highlight the extremely heterogeneous nature of the surface vegetation-derived DOC input in peatlands and stress the importance of vegetation species in peatland ecosystem function.

AB This study of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Germany is based on the national greenhouse gas inventory, which was compiled as part of a report the EU's National Inventory Report (NIR) to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in order to collect and evaluate data about all direct GHG emissions from agriculture at the state level. The purpose of this anallysis was (1) to determine which GHG sources are the most important and should, therefore, be primarily considered for the implementation of mitigation strategies; and (2) to find any possible connections between structural and technological changes as well as changes in management which have influenced the amount of GHG emissions from the individual sources over the past years since 1990.
   A business ABC analysis was used to analyse the data from the NIR as it is a method which allows a rating of the sources and sinks for GHG emissions, thereby enabling their importance to be determined. Based on this approach, individual strategies for different countries can be evaluated in order to determine the proper strategy out of a portfolio of mitigation measures for each country.
   Out of a total of 30 individual sources identified in Germany using the ABC analysis, four GHG sources contributed to 63.2% of the total emissions from the agricultural sector: agriculturally used peat soils, entric fermentation of cattle, drainage of grassland and usage of mineral fertilizer In the MR, five emission categories are given; namely, manure management, enteric fermentation, agricultural soils, land use and land use change (LULUC), and fuels. The categories dealing with the utilization of farmland, namely agricultural soils and LULUC, were found to cause 68.6% of the total of GHG emissions from agriculture. lnterestingly, the consumption of fuels, even in a highly mechanised agricultural system such as that found in Germany, only represents 6% of the total GHG emissions from agriculture. Sinks ill Germany are minor (is they only sequestrate 1.5% (if the total emissions. The evaluation of the agricultural GHG emission changes ill Germany, which decreased by about 16.0% within the period from 1990 to 2004, shows that the biggest part of GHG emission mitigation has been based oil structural change rather than oil abatement measures.

AB The effect of episodic drought on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in peatlands has been the subject of considerable debate, as decomposition and DOC production is thought to increase under aerobic conditions, yet decreased DOC concentrations have been observed during drought periods. Decreased DOC solubility due to drought-induced acidification driven by sulphur (S) redox reactions has been proposed as a causal mechanism; however evidence is based on a limited number of studies carried out at a few sites. To test this hypothesis on a range of different peats, we carried out controlled drought simulation experiments on peat cores collected from six sites across Great Britain. Our data show a concurrent increase in sulphate (SO4) and a decrease in DOC across all sites during simulated water table draw-down, although the magnitude of the relationship between SO4 and DOC differed between sites. Instead, we found a consistent relationship across all sites between DOC decrease and acidification measured by the pore water acid neutralising capacity (ANC). ANC provided a more consistent measure of drought-induced acidification than SO4 alone because it accounts for differences in base cation and acid anions concentrations between sites. Rewetting resulted in rapid DOC increases without a concurrent increase in soil respiration, suggesting DOC changes were primarily controlled by soil acidity not soil biota. These results highlight the need for an integrated analysis of hydrologically driven chemical and biological processes in peatlands to improve our understanding and ability to predict the interaction between atmospheric pollution and changing climatic conditions from plot to regional and global scales.

AB About 0.3 million km(2) of boreal forests and peatlands and their soils have been flooded through the creation of hydroelectric reservoirs. To establish the effect of flooding on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) production, we incubated six sample types of boreal forest and peatland soils and litters for 15 weeks under flooded (anoxic and suboxic) and non-flooded (oxic) conditions at three temperatures (4, 12, and 22 A degrees C). Water was sampled at 3-week intervals and analyzed for DOC and TDN concentration. Cumulative DOC and TDN production ranged widely: from 4.4 to 146.2 mg C g(-1) C for DOC and 4.4 to 112.2 mg N g(-1) N for TDN under flooded conditions, and from 1.3 to 16.6 mg C g(-1) C for DOC and 0.7 to 8.5 mg N g(-1) N for TDN under non-flooded conditions. Cumulative DOC and TDN production was greater under flooded than non-flooded conditions for all sample types with flooded:non-flooded ratios averaging 10.6 for DOC and 9.5 for TDN. Within the flooded treatments, anoxic conditions produced more cumulative DOC and TDN than suboxic conditions, with average anoxic:suboxic ratios of 1.3 and 5.8 for DOC and TDN, respectively. Raising temperatures increased cumulative DOC and TDN production marginally under both flooded and non-flooded conditions as the average ratios for 22:12 and 12:4 A degrees C were 1.1 for DOC and 1.2 for TDN. Generally, more DOC and TDN were released from litters than soils under both the flooded and non-flooded incubations, with litter:soil ratios averaging 8.5 for DOC and 2.1 for TDN. DOC:TDN ratio was generally higher in the solutions than in the original sample, particularly in the litters. This study thus indicated that DOC and TDN production was largely affected by flooding regime, O-2 concentration, and substrate characteristics and less affected by temperature.

AB A pilot-scale study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of using a passive treatment system to mitigate the acid mine drainage at the abandoned Williams Brothers Mine site, a remote site located in Sierra National Forest (California). The advantages of implementing passive treatment systems in remote or abandoned mine sites are their low energy and maintenance requirements compared to conventional systems. A pilot-scale system was designed and implemented at the site, which consisted of: (1) an aeration rock channel to facilitate oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron; (2) a sedimentation tank to collect iron oxyhydroxide precipitates that could lead to the clogging of the system; (3) a peat biofilter for the removal of dissolved iron and copper; (4) a sulphate-reducing bacteria reactor for the generation of alkalinity and consequent pH increase, and the removal of dissolved nickel, zinc, and residual dissolved iron and copper; and, (5) a re-aeration limestone channel to add alkalinity prior to effluent discharge into the natural receiving environment. The pilot-scale system was monitored over a 17-month period (500 days from July 2007 to November 2008) and performance was determined by monitoring the pH, sulphate and dissolved metal concentrations of the influent acid mine drainage and the effluents from the peat biofilter and sulphate reducing bacteria reactor. A decrease in sulphate concentration was noted in the sulphate reducing bacteria reactor, suggesting sulphate reducing bacteria activity and alkalinity generation. The effluent pH from the system increased from as low as 4.5 to above 6.0, but remained below water quality objectives for the San Joaquin River Basin. Dissolved copper, nickel and zinc removal to below water quality objectives was noted in the peat biofilter to below water quality objectives. Dissolved iron and manganese removal was also observed in the sulphate reducing bacteria reactor. The feasibility of employing this system as a sustainable low cost and low maintenance treatment alternative at the Williams Brothers abandoned mine site to ensure that drainage effluent will meet water quality objectives showed promise. However, long-term monitoring would be required to demonstrate and ensure their long-term effectiveness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims Global change is shown to significantly affect the C storage function of peatlands; however, a majority of previous research is focused on a single environmental stressor such as the increased temperature. As a result, little is known about the interactive effect of multiple environmental stressors on peatland C storage, especially in sedge-dominated fen peatlands. Methods We performed a full factorial experiment of increased temperature and elevated atmospheric CO(2)concentration on minerotrophic, sedge-dominated fen monoliths to experimentally examine the individual and interactive effects of simulated future climate conditions on peatland plant biomass, CO(2)exchange, and pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over one full growing season. Results Our study demonstrates that warming and elevated atmospheric CO(2)significantly increased aboveground and belowground biomass, respectively, as well as the gross ecosystem production (GEP), while the DOC concentrations and respired CO(2)from peatland soils only increased under warming Conclusions Our results suggest that global change will increase both plant production and microbial decomposition, but with altered plant biomass allocation between aboveground and belowground. Our study provides experimental evidence for shifts in ecosystem-level carbon dynamics under global change for a sedge-dominated peatland, and suggests that while carbon stores may weaken, the carbon sink will be maintained in these types of northern peatlands if hydrological conditions are largely maintained.

AB Increases in pool water and peat temperature in summer accelerate peat decomposition and production of biogenic gases, which can be trapped in peat pores and cause oscillation of peatland surfaces and the rise of peat from the bottom of bog pools. Associated changes in peat water conductivity, holding capacity and transpiration also affect bog hydrology. Our multi-year study is the first to show in detail the extent and dynamics of changes in bog pool depth and bottom topography associated with changes in temperature, peat type and other factors. The true seasonal rise of peat from the pool bottom begins once the water temperature at the pool bottom exceeds 13-14 degrees C, although the speed and extent of the rise depends on peat properties, making the rise more erratic than its subsequent descent. The more rapid descent occurs after the first large drop in the temperature of the pool's surface water at the end of summer, resulting from the combination of reduced methane production and increased gas solubility with less influence by peat properties. Much higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations (216 +/- 26mgl(-1)) in the pore water of peat risen from the bottom to the pool surface compared with that in the same type of peat at the pool bottom (62 +/- 20mgl(-1)) indicate an acceleration of peat decomposition at the warmer pool surface. We show the extent and character of changes in pool depth and bottom topography and how annual differences relate to temperature. Only a few degrees' increase in pool water temperature could induce the pool bottom to rise faster and more extensively for a longer period and enhance decomposition in the peat at the pool surface. This should be evaluated in greater detail to assess the effects of temperature increase on the carbon budget and hydrology of peatlands. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost organic carbon decomposition in lakes and rivers can accelerate global warming. We used radiocarbon (C-14) measurements to determine the predominant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and methane (CH4) in five thermokarst lakes and three rivers in an area of widespread permafrost degradation in Northern Quebec to assess contributions from thawing permafrost and other old carbon (fixed before CE 1950) reservoirs. We compared emission pathways (dissolved gas and ebullition), seasons (summer and winter), and surface soil type (mineral and peat soils). Modern carbon (fixed after CE 1950) was the dominant source of DOC, DIC, and CH4 of non-peatland aquatic systems, while POC and sediment carbon were predominantly fixed in the last millennia. In the peatland systems, modern and permafrost carbon were important sources of DOC, lake DIC, lake ebullition CO2, and lake dissolved CH4. In contrast, POC, lake ebullition CH4, and river DIC were dominated by millennial-old carbon. In winter, the C-14 age of DOC, DIC, and POC in the peatland lakes increased, but the C-14 age of dissolved CH4 did not change. Our results point to a clearly older overall carbon source for ebullition CH4 relative to dissolved CH4 in the peatland lakes but not the non-peatland lakes. The younger ages of dissolved CH4 and DIC relative to DOC and POC in all lakes suggest that recent primary productivity strongly influences the large total lake CH4 and CO2 emissions in this area, as diffusion fluxes greatly exceed ebullition fluxes.

AB Many catchment management schemes in the UK have focussed on peatland restoration to improve ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, water quality and biodiversity. The effect of these schemes on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux is critical in understanding peatland carbon budgets as well as the implications for drinking water treatment. In many catchments, however, peatland areas arc not the only source of DOC, meaning that their significance at the full catchment scale is unclear. In this paper we have evaluated the importance of different land uses as sources of DOC by combining three damsels obtained from the Exe catchment, UK. The first dataset comprises a weekly monitoring record at three sites for six years, the second, a monthly monitoring record of 25 sites in the same catchment for one year, and the third, an assessment of DOC export from litter and soil carbon stocks. Our results suggest that DOC concentration significantly increased from the peaty headwaters to the mixed land-use areas (ANOVA F = 12.52, p < 0.001, df = 2), leading to higher flux estimates at the downstream sites. We present evidence for three possible explanations: firstly, that poor sampling of high flows may lead to underestimation of DOC flux, second, that there are significant sources of DOC besides the peatland head-waters, and finally, that biological- and photo-degradation decreases the influence of upstream DOC sources. Our results provide evidence both for the targeting of catchment management in peatland areas as well as the need to consider DOC from agricultural and forested areas of the catchment.

AB Studies conducted across northern Europe and North America have shown increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic systems in recent decades. While there is little consensus as to the exact mechanisms for the increases in DOC, hypotheses converge on such climate change factors as warming, increased precipitation variability, and changes in atmospheric deposition. In this study, we tested the effects of warming on peat porewater composition by actively warming a peatland with infrared lamps mounted 1.24 m above the peat surface for 3 years. Mean growing season peat temperatures in the warmed plots (n = 5) were 1.9 +/- A 0.4 A degrees C warmer than the control plots at 5 cm depth (t statistic = 5.03, p = 0.007). Mean porewater DOC concentrations measured throughout the growing season were 15 % higher in the warmed plots (73.4 +/- A 3.2 mg L-1) than in the control plots (63.7 +/- A 2.1 mg L-1) at 25 cm (t = 4.69, p < 0.001). Furthermore, DOC from the warmed plots decayed nearly twice as fast as control plot DOC in laboratory incubations, and exhibited lower aromaticity than control plot porewater (reduction in SUVA(254) in heated plots compared with control plots). Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations tracked DOC patterns as expected, but the amount of dissolved N per unit C decreased with warming. Previous work has shown that warming increased net primary production at this site, and together with measured increases in the activities of chitinases and glucosidases we suggest that the increased DOC concentrations observed with warming were derived in part from microbial-plant interactions in the rhizosphere. We also detected more nitrogen containing compounds with higher double bond equivalents (DBE) unique to the warmed plots, within the pool of biomolecules able to deprotonate (16 % of all compounds identified using ultrahigh resolution ion electrospray mass spectrometry); we suggest these compounds could be the products of increased plant, microbial, and enzyme activity occurring with warming. With continued warming in peatlands, an increase in relatively labile DOC concentrations could contribute to dissolved exports of DOC in runoff, and would likely contribute to the pool of efficient electron donors (and acceptors) in the production of CO2 and CH4 in terrestrial and aquatic environments.

AB Porewater chemistry is an integrative measure of the physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring within peatland ecosystems, and therefore some chemistry measures (e.g., pH, calcium concentrations) have been used to classify bog vs fen peatlands. However, porewater sampling is often limited in spatial and temporal resolution, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal variation in porewater chemistry. We examined depth profiles of porewater chemistry in four nearby peatlands that fall along a bog to rich fen gradient in northcentral Minnesota, USA. Porewater was sampled similar to monthly during one ice-free season from three replicate piezometer nests per peatland to quantify temporal and spatial variability of those depth profiles. Porewater depth profiles of pH, calcium and total organic carbon concentrations, and delta O-18-H2O varied along the bog to fen gradient, but total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations did not. Porewater chemistry was similar in the bogs and poor fen which were all quite different from the rich fen. In contrast, temporal and spatial variation in porewater chemistry, quantified using coefficients of variation, did not differ between bogs and fens despite the hypothesis that variation in porewater chemistry would be lower in fens than bogs due to the perennial throughput of large volumes of discharging groundwater in the rich fen. Spatial and temporal variability in porewater chemistry across all peatland types highlights the importance of collecting porewater samples in multiples over time in both near-surface and deeper peats. This variation can be important when scaling findings to the peatland scale, assessing the representativeness of peatlands within a larger landscape, and understanding variability in solute export to downstream ecosystems.

AB To improve understanding of carbon budgets in tropical wetlands, there is need to include estimates of fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which are usually influenced by hydrological conditions. In this study, an assessment was made to test the hypotheses that tropical wetlands show significant fluvial losses of organic carbon and that these fluvial losses vary seasonally depending on the rate of water movement through the wetland. Measurements were made on a wetland dominated by Cyperus papyrus near Kampala, Uganda. DOC loads were computed from inflows and outflows discharge during wet and dry season. The inflow and outflow DOC concentrations ranged between 5.99 and 7.48 mg l(-1) and 5.88-10.6 mg l(-1) during dry season, and 6.24-8.48 mg l(-1) and 6.20-23.65 mg l(-1) during wet season respectively. There was little difference (12.5 %) in the load coming in and going out in the wet season, so DOC loss was not detected at this time. In the dry season, the loads were much smaller but there was more going out than coming in (32.6 %), but nevertheless there was a detectable loss of carbon from the wetland at this time.

AB Northern peatlands are important stores of carbon and reservoirs of biodiversity that are vulnerable to global change. However, the carbon dynamics of individual peatland plant species is poorly understood, despite the potential for rising atmospheric CO2 to affect the vegetation's contribution to overall ecosystem carbon function. Here, we examined the effects of 3 years exposure to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on (a) peatland plant community composition and biomass, and (b) plant carbon dynamics and the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase approach. Results showed that under eCO(2), Sphagnum spp. cover declined by 39% (P < 0.05) and Juncus effusus L. cover increased by 40% (P < 0.001). There was a concurrent increase in above- and belowground plant biomass of 115% (P < 0.01) and 96% (P < 0.01), respectively. Vascular species assimilated and turned over more (CO2)-C-13-derived carbon than Sphagnum spp. (49% greater turnover of assimilated C-13 in J. effusus and F. ovina L. leaf tissues compared with Sphagnum, P < 0.01). Elevated CO2 also produced a 66% rise in DOC concentrations (P < 0.001) and an order of magnitude more 'new' exudate (DOC)-D-13 than control samples (24 h after (CO2)-C-13 pulse-labelling 2.5 +/- 0.5 and 0.2 +/- 0.1% in eCO(2) and control leachate, respectively, P < 0.05). We attribute the observed increase in DOC concentrations under eCO(2) to the switch from predominantly Sphagnum spp. to vascular species (namely J. effusus), leading to enhanced exudation and decomposition (litter and peat). The potential for reduced peatland carbon accretion, increased DOC exports and positive feedback to climate change are discussed.

AB We examined dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production and quality in a cutover (extracted) and restored peatland in eastern Quebec through a combined laboratory DOC production study and an accompanying field DOC runoff quality study. Both temperature and substrate were significant for explaining variability in net DOC production rate in both short (5 days) and longer term (25 day) laboratory incubations. Moss (Sphagnum spp. and Polytricum spp.) produced the least amount of DOC, with initial release rates of 0.02-0.35 mg DOC g(-1) d(-1). Shrubs, and to a lesser extent herbaceous vegetation, showed an initial high release of DOC followed by a decrease. Peat from the restored site had significantly higher longer-term DOC production rates than the cutover site. Humic acid (HA) was more likely to be produced by shrub and herbaceous plant material than by peat, mosses and straw. The hydrophilic (HPI) fraction of the DOC increased at higher temperatures. Despite differences in the surface cover of available substrate (e.g. vascular vegetation, moss, and straw), there was no difference in the quality of DOC exported from the cutover and restored sites. However, hydrological and biogeochemical controls were apparent in temporal variability of DOC quality in discharge. DOC exported during snowmelt and most storm events was high in HPI with little contribution from HA. Since contact time between water and soil is limited during these high flow periods, larger more hydrophobic HA molecules are less likely to be mobilized. Higher export of HA in summer compared to spring and autumn suggests that polycondensation and increased vascular plant productivity are important for controlling seasonal patterns of DOC export quality. As various substrates produced different amounts and quality of DOC, it is likely that the DOC quality exported from the restored site will continue to change as the new vegetation community develops. DOC production rates and DOC quality should be considered when developing a plan to control DOC runoff/export from managed peatlands. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from a typical UK upland reservoir water using three different coagulants; aluminium sulphate/alum (Al-2(SO4)(3(aq))), polyaluminium chloride/PAX-18 (Al-n(OH)(m)Cl3n-m(aq)) and ferric sulphate/PIX-322 (Fe-2(SO4)(3(aq))). A comparison of DOC quality including fractional character, colour, specific ultraviolet absorption (SUVA) and molecular weight was made between the source water and the supernatants obtained following its coagulation in each case. Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) was compared before and after treatment to assess which coagulant performed best in terms of THM amelioration. The conditions (coagulant dose and pH) required to obtain optimal DOC removal were established using bench-scale jar tests. Statistically significant differences in DOC removal rates were observed between the different coagulants. THMFP removal was linked to a combination of high net DOC removal and the preferential removal of THM precursors. This selectivity may also be responsible for the increase in brominated THM species (BrTHMs) observed following treatment.

AB Permafrost thaw in peatlands has the potential to alter catchment export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and thus influence downstream aquatic C cycling. Subarctic peatlands are often mosaics of different peatland types, where permafrost conditions regulate the hydrological setting of each type. We show that hydrological setting is key to observed differences in magnitude, timing, and chemical composition of DOC export between permafrost and nonpermafrost peatland types, and that these differences influence the export of DOC of larger catchments even when peatlands are minor catchment components. In many aspects, DOC export from a studied peatland permafrost plateau was similar to that of a forested upland catchment. Similarities included low annual export (2-3g Cm-2) dominated by the snow melt period (similar to 70%), and how substantial DOC export following storms required wet antecedent conditions. Conversely, nonpermafrost fens had higher DOC export (7g Cm-2), resulting from sustained hydrological connectivity during summer. Chemical composition of catchment DOC export arose from the mixing of highly aromatic DOC from organic soils from permafrost plateau soil water and upland forest surface horizons with nonaromatic DOC from mineral soil groundwater, but was further modulated by fens. Increasing aromaticity from fen inflow to outlet was substantial and depended on both water residence time and water temperature. The role of fens as catchment biogeochemical hotspots was further emphasized by their capacity for sulfate retention. As a result of fen characteristics, a 4% fen cover in a mixed catchment was responsible for 34% higher DOC export, 50% higher DOC concentrations and similar to 10% higher DOC aromaticity at the catchment outlet during summer compared to a nonpeatland upland catchment. Expansion of fens due to thaw thus has potential to influence landscape C cycling by increasing fen capacity to act as biogeochemical hotspots, amplifying aquatic C cycling, and increasing catchment DOC export.

AB Accurate quantification of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface and soil pore waters is crucial for understanding changes in water resources under the influence of climate and land use changes. Sampling and laboratory analysis of DOC content at a sufficient temporal frequency are especially difficult to achieve for natural DOC sources like the extensive boreal and arctic mire landscapes due to their remoteness. Therefore, the goals of this paper are (1) to investigate the performance of a portable, high-resolution ultraviolet-visible light spectroscopic method for determining the DOC content of surface and soil pore water samples from a boreal mire complex and (2) to compare the spectroscopic method with other DOC measurement techniques, e.g., the wet heated persulfate oxidation method and a laboratory, expulsion-based spectrophotometric method and (3) to assess different multivariate models that relate absorbance measurements with DOC contents. The study indicates that high-resolution spectroscopic measurements provide a simple, robust and non-destructive method for measuring DOC content. These measurements are of short duration (<1 min) and the sample analysis is portable, rendering this method particularly advantageous for in situ investigations at remote field locations. The study also demonstrates that if absorbances at specific wavelengths are used as proxies for DOC concentration, it is recommended to create site-specific calibration models that include more than one wavelength to achieve the optimal accuracy of the proxy-based DOC quantification.

AB A basic sedimentological and palaeopedological framework is now in place for non-marine sequence models. The variability of interfluve palaeosols has not, however, been systematically documented, nor have the stratigraphic implications of that variability been incorporated into sequence models. Interfluve palaeosol variability in the deltaic Dunvegan Formation, NE British Columbia, Canada, is investigated, for which a detailed allostratigraphic and palaeogeographic framework has been developed, based on abundant well (> 2300 logs) and outcrop (> 60 sections) control. Regionally extensive valley fills and interfluves have been mapped in coastal plain deposits over an area of about 50 000 km(2). This palaeogeographic framework permits interfluve surfaces exposed in outcrop to be located in terms of distance from the margins of coeval valleys. The micromorphological, geochemical and mineralogical characteristics of five representative sequence-bounding palaeosols located from 250 m to more than 15 km from coeval valley margins are described. These interfluve palaeosols are similar to modern Alfisols and all record (i) aggradation on an alluvial/coastal plain; (ii) a subsequent static and/or degradational phase related to valley incision, non-deposition and soil thickening; and (iii) a final aggradational phase related to valley filling and renewed sedimentation across the coastal plain. Within this overall template, however, variations in palaeosol thickness, redoximorphic features, illuvial clay content and geochemistry suggest developmental control by hydrological characteristics that were influenced by both the nature of the underlying alluvial sediments and distance from the valley margin. The presence of mature interfluve palaeosols with complex developmental histories suggests that landscape dissection may have been related to terrace development associated with valley incision. Palaeosols closer to valley margins are thicker, contain more illuvial clay and display characteristics suggesting better drained conditions relative to those palaeosols that developed further from valley margins. Subsequent deposition on interfluves also reflects distance from valleys, with those sites close to valleys accumulating cumulic soils with evidence of brackish groundwater, whereas far from valleys (> 10-15 km), groundwater was fresh and clastic supply minimal, encouraging peat formation. Variations in drainage and palaeotopography during landscape dissection resulted in different palaeosol development styles on interfluve surfaces that can be shown, on the basis of physical correlation, to have the same geomorphic age. These observations support the concept of the soil-forming interval as a basis for pedostratigraphic correlation in ancient terrestrial deposits. Palaeosol variability on interfluves is to be expected, and recognition and documentation of this variability is an important prerequisite to palaeogeomorphological, palaeoclimatic and sequence stratigraphic interpretations.

AB The percentage of wetlands in a catchment accounted for about half of the variance in transformed data for concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) in 42 Nova Scotian streams draining catchments with 11 different kinds of vegetation. Color increased with DOG, as did total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). The colar/DOC and DOC/TDN quotients also rose with increasing DOG, indicating a change in the quality of dissolved organic matter with increasing wetland influence. Dissolved Fe, and to a much lesser extent dissolved Al, showed a strong positive correlation with DOG. Stream pH showed a strong negative correlation with DOG, largely from wetlands, and a strong positive correlation with non-marine Ca2+ weathered from mineral soils. Non-marine SO42- from acid deposition had no apparent influence on stream pH and decreased with increasing streamwater DOC in summer, presumably owing to reduction processes in wetlands that mitigated the effects of acid deposition. Apparently, these reduction processes also produced small amounts of dissolved, non-ionic organic sulfur. Non-marine Ca2+ was related strongly to the percentage of upland hardwood forests in the catchments. Wetlands exert a profound influence on the chemistry of streams, principally through their export of DOC but also because of reduction reactions in their anerobic peats.

AB Rising dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in many upland UK catchments represents a challenge for drinking water companies, in particular due to the role of DOC as a precursor in the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs). Whereas traditionally, the response of drinking water companies has been focussed on treatment processes, increasingly, efforts have been made to better understanding the role of land use and catchment processes in affecting drinking water quality. In this study, water quality, including DOC and THM formation potential (THMFP) was assessed between the water source and finished drinking water at an upland and a lowland catchment. Surprisingly, the lowland catchment showed much higher reservoir DOC concentrations apparently due to the influence of a fen within the catchment from where a major reservoir inflow stream originated. Seasonal variations in water quality were observed, driving changes in THMFP. However, the reservoirs in both catchments appeared to dampen these temporal fluctuations. Treatment process applied in the 2 catchments were adapted to reservoir water quality with much higher DOC and THMFP removal rates observed at the lowland water treatment works where coagulation-flocculation was applied. However, selectivity during this DOC removal stage also appeared to increase the proportion of brominated THMs produced. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB UK peatlands are affected by severe gully erosion with consequent impacts on ecosystem services from these areas. Incision into the peat can damage the vegetation and hydrology and lead to increases in carbon loss and sediment transfer downstream. Gullies represent then a conduit for and a hotspot of carbon loss but the relatively high water tables of gullies have meant that they have been identified as areas with a high restoration potential because of easily restored peat-forming conditions. This study uses a series of gully sites, subject to different restoration interventions, to investigate differences in carbon pathways (DOC, CO2) and hydrology between restoration strategies and gully position. The results show that the position within the gully (interfluve, gully side, or gully floor) does not significantly affect water quality but that it plays a significant role in CO2 exchange. Gully floors are areas of high photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration, though net ecosystem exchange is not significantly different across the gully. While gully position plays a role in the cycling of some carbon species, this study highlights the importance of vegetation as a key control on carbon cycling.

AB Stream water carbon concentrations can be highly dynamic on the time scales of both individual storm events and seasonal hydroclimatic shifts. We collected stream water daily over a 6-day storm from three headwater subcatchments of varying landcover (poor fen, forested wetland, and upland forest) and the catchment outlet to evaluate how precipitation events impact the concentration and speciation of carbon (organic vs. inorganic) as well as the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported laterally from coastal temperate rainforest catchments. Dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations increased during the storm at all sites, while dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations were diluted during peak flows. These results highlight the importance of quantifying all forms of lateral carbon export when evaluating the role of storms in catchment-scale carbon cycling. Isotopic hydrograph separation using stream water delta O-18 showed that percent new water was significantly related to carbon concentration and form providing a clear link between stream water sources (i.e., recent event water) and soil carbon source areas that become connected to surface water during storms. Furthermore, ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry showed that stream water DOM exported from the upland forest contained the greatest molecular diversity of the three landscape types and had the largest changes in composition over the storm suggesting that the wetland-dominated subcatchments were less compositionally diverse with regard to soil DOM pools active during the storm. Overall, this study provides insight into hydro-biogeochemical drivers that control lateral carbon export from forested catchments in a region where an increasing fraction of precipitation is falling as rain.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effects of freezing and cold storage at 4 degrees C on bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentration and SEC fractions determined with size exclusion chromatography (SEC), as well as on spectral properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) analyzed with fluorescence spectroscopy. In order to account for differences in DOM composition and source we analyzed storage effects for three different sample types, including a lake water sample representing freshwater DOM, a leaf litter leachate of Phragmites australis representing a terrestrial, 'fresh' DOM source and peatland porewater samples. According to our findings one week of cold storage can bias DOC and DON determination. Overall, the determination of DOC and DON concentration with SEC analysis for all three sample types were little susceptible to alterations due to freezing. The findings derived for the sampling locations investigated here may not apply for other sampling locations and/or sample types. However, DOC size fractions and DON concentration of formerly frozen samples should be interpreted with caution when sample concentrations are high. Alteration of some optical properties (HIX and SUVA(254)) due to freezing were evident, and therefore we recommend immediate analysis of samples for spectral analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Drought conditions are expected to increase in frequency and severity as the climate changes, representing a threat to carbon sequestered in peat soils. Downstream water treatment works are also at risk of regulatory compliance failures and higher treatment costs due to the increase in riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) often observed after droughts. More frequent droughts may also shift dominant vegetation in peatlands from Sphagnum moss to more drought-tolerant species. This paper examines the impact of drought on the production and treatability of DOC from four vegetation litters (Calluna vulgaris, Juncus effusus, Molinia caerulea and Sphagnum spp.) and a peat soil. We found that mild droughts caused a 39.6% increase in DOC production from peat and that peat DOC that had been exposed to oxygen was harder to remove by conventional water treatment processes (coagulation/flocculation). Drought had no effect on the amount of DOC production from vegetation litters; however large variation was observed between typical peatland species (Sphagnum and Calluna) and drought-tolerant grassland species (Juncus and Molinia), with the latter producing more DOC per unit weight. This would therefore suggest the increase in riverine DOC often observed post-drought is due entirely to soil microbial processes and DOC solubility rather than litter layer effects. Long-term shifts in species diversity may, therefore, be the most important impact of drought on litter layer DOC flux, whereas pulses related to drought may be observed in peat soils and are likely to become more common in the future. These results pro-vide evidence in support of catchment management which increases the resilience of peat soils to drought, such as ditch blocking to raise water tables.

DE FLOODPLAIN MIRES; GROUNDWATER; HYDROCHEMISTRY; WETLANDS
AB Groundwater heads and chemical composition were measured at approximately two week intervals during the summer of 1993 along a 1 km transect across the Insh Marshes floodplain mire in Inverness-shire, Scotland. Groundwater heads were generally higher near the valley side slope, with lower pH values and greater dissolved organic carbon, Al and Cl concentrations. In the centre of the transect, upward groundwater heads were identified and pH, conductivity and concentrations of base cations were much greater. Near the River Spey, pH and base cation concentrations decreased and Al and Cl concentrations increased. Deep groundwater followed a similar spatial trend but was generally more base-rich than shallow groundwater. These variations reflect the influence of three major water sources with different chemical signatures. Runoff from the valley side slope increased dissolved organic carbon and AT in the shallow groundwater, the upward flow of groundwater increased the pH and Ca concentration and inundation near the river decreased the base status and increased Cl and Al.

AB Organic matter decomposition in response to thawing permafrost has critical implications for carbon release. This study examined how thaw induced plant community and environmental changes influenced litter and peat decomposition in a subarctic peatland.
   We conducted laboratory incubations under current site pre-thaw (dry and large oxic peat layer) and thawed (wet and small oxic peat layer) conditions, and mimiced pond thaw conditions (water saturated and anoxic) at 4 and 22 A degrees C. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) releases from ground surface plant litter and top 1 m peat samples at permafrost area (Palsa) and wet thawed lawn (WL) were quantified under current site conditions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from litter was additionally quantified under pond thaw conditions.
   Plant litter mass significantly increased from Palsa to WL. Under current site conditions, litter in WL had significantly higher CO2 and CH4 production rates than litter in Palsa. Pond thaw conditions changed litter carbon loss partitioning into lower CO2 but higher DOC and CH4 production, and increased total carbon release. Whole peat decomposition was restricted from Palsa to WL with thaw. Estimated growing season gas carbon loss (CO2 and CH4) in WL was greater than that in Palsa due to significantly increased litter carbon loss after thaw.
   Changes in organic matter decomposition, especially litter decomposition, enlarged carbon losses from this subarctic peatland with permafrost thaw.

AB The close interplay between hydraulic and biotic processes controls the evolution of ecosystems in large, circumboreal peatlands and the degree to which they lose, gain or sequester carbon. In peatlands, biota significantly alters surficial acid-base equilibrium and solute chemistry by releasing dissolved organic compounds into surface and pore waters, which then mix through advection and dispersion through pore water flow paths.
   We report herein the results of new geochemical mixing models that incorporates organic acid dissociation constants to understand how organic acids control the acid-base chemistry in mixtures of dilute acidic bog pore waters and circum-neutral groundwater (typical of carbonate terrains) that upwells or disperses into peat deposits.
   In our new mixing models, at least twice as much groundwater is required to neutralize bog water acidity when dissolved organic carbon concentrations exceed 10 mmol/L than in their absence. Although it remains uncertain how future climatic change will alter the composition of dissolved organic matter in peatlands, organic acids should remain an important factor with respect to potential neutralization of peatland waters by groundwater sources. The acid base equilibria in large peat basins not only has important implications for vegetation patterning but also for biogeochemical cycles in these globally important reservoirs for carbon.

AB We characterized the water chemistry of nine slope wetlands and adjacent headwater streams in Colorado subalpine forests and compared sites in basins formed on crystalline bedrock with those formed in basins with a mixture of crystalline and sedimentary bedrock. The pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH (4) (+) , acid neutralizing capacity, and electrical conductivity of wetland porewater and streamwater were higher in the basins with mixed geology. Bryophyte cover was higher in lower pH, crystalline basins, and vascular plant cover was higher in the mixed bedrock basins. On average, wetland porewater had lower pH and higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen and several other ions than streamwater; however, because discharge from these small wetlands is low, their direct influence on stream solute concentrations was generally undetectable. Dilution altered stream solute concentrations during peak flow in both basin types, but had little effect on wetland chemistry. In contrast to other solutes, the concentration of DOC in streams increased marginally during peak runoff and its concentration in wetland porewater was stable throughout the year. These findings further knowledge of the influence of watershed characteristics on wetland and stream chemistry and will inform future decisions regarding conservation and management in headwater basins.

AB Plants are known to influence peatland carbon fluxes both i) directly through respiration and ii) by the production of litter and root exudates, which are then broken down by microbes within the peat matrix. In this study we investigated whether three different plant species typical of a UK blanket bog complex - Calluna vulgaris, Juncus effusus and mixed Sphagnum species - influence the carbon sequestering abilities of the peat that they grow in. To quantify this we measured fluxes of soil derived CO2 and CH4, and extractable levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phenolics, from peat samples taken from areas dominated by one of the three plant communities. It was found that there were significant differences between the carbon fluxes from the different sites, which we attributed to changes brought about by the vegetation on the pH, phenolic concentrations and extracellular enzyme activities found in the peat matrix. Peat taken from Sphagnum-dominated areas emitted less CO2 than the other two sample groups, and had lower overall DOC concentrations and phenol oxidase activities. Conversely, Juncus-peat had the highest CO2 and CH4 fluxes, along with the greatest phenol oxidase activities. Taking all the results into consideration the plants were ranked in order of their ability to reduce the loss of carbon from the peat soil within which they were growing: Sphagnum>Calluna>Juncus. These results suggest that plant community structures could be altered in order to maximise a peatland's ability to be used as a carbon store should they need to be managed as part of a carbon stewardship scheme or a geoengineering project - if this was to be the sole management interest in an area of peatland.

AB During the last decades, increasing exports of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron were observed from peat catchments in North America and Europe with potential consequences for water quality of streamwater and carbon storages of soils. As mobilisation and transport processes of DOC and iron in peat catchments are only partly understood, the purpose of this study was to elucidate these processes in an intensively monitored and studied system. Specifically, it was hypothesised that dissimilatory iron reduction in riparian peatland soils mobilises DOC initially adsorbed to iron minerals. During stormflow conditions, both DOC and iron will be transported into the stream network. Ferrous iron may be reoxidised at redox interfaces on its way to the stream, and subsequently, ferric iron could be transported together with DOC as complexes. To test these hypotheses, generalised additive models (GAMs) were applied to 14 years of weekly time series of discharge and concentrations of selected solutes measured in a German headwater stream called Lehstenbach. This stream drains a 4.19-km(2) forested mountain catchment; one third of which is covered by riparian peatland soils. We interpreted results of different types of GAM in the way that (a) iron reduction drove the mobilisation of DOC from peatland soils and that (b) both iron and DOC were transported as complexes after their joint mobilisation to and within the steam. It was speculated that low nitrate availability in the uppermost wetland soil layer, particularly during the growing season, promoted iron reduction and thus the mobilisation of DOC. However, the influence of nitrate on the DOC mobilisation remains relatively uncertain. This influence could be further investigated using methods similar to the GAM analysis conducted here for other catchments with long-term data as well as detailed measurements of the relevant species in riparian wetland soils and the adjacent stream network.

AB We examined the sources, sinks, and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its chemical fractions over a 4-year period in upland and wetland catchments in the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario. In an upland catchment, the major sources of DOC were precipitation, vegetation, and soil organic matter, resulting in a summer (June to October) export of 2.1 g.m(-2). DOC concentrations in peat pore water ranged from 20 to 60 mg.L-1 and were related to hydrologic pathways. DOC export from catchments containing wetlands ranged from 0.8 to 5.7 g.m(-2) and export from the peatland portion of the catchment was estimated to be 28-30 g.m(-2). Flooding to a depth of 1.2 in in the peatland section of one catchment resulted in an increase in pore-water and pond DOC concentrations, attributed to the decomposition of plant tissues and peat. Because only 14% of the catchment was flooded, impoundment did not result in a significant increase in DOC export. Between 85 and 93% of DOC was contained in the acid fractions, with small amounts in the neutral fractions. Flooding increased the proportion of the hydrophilic neutral fraction in peat pore waters for 2 years after flooding.

AB We identify and assess the relative importance of the principal factors influencing the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved forms of nitrogen (N) from a small upland headwater dominated by podzolic soils during a sequence of autumn runoff events. We achieve this by subjecting high-resolution hydrometeorological and hydrochemical data to an R-mode principal component factor analysis and a stepwise multivariate regression analysis. We find that the release of DOC and N is influenced by four principal factors, namely event magnitude, soil water flow through the Bs horizon, the length of time since the soil profile was last flushed, and rewetting of the H horizon. The release of DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is most strongly influenced by the combination of event magnitude and soil water flow through the Bs horizon, and to a lesser extent by the length of time since the soil profile was last flushed. Rewetting of the H horizon also influences the release of DOC, but this is not the case for DON. The release of nitrate (NO(3)-N) is most strongly influenced by the combination of the length of time since the soil profile was last flushed and rewetting of the H horizon, and to a lesser extent by event magnitude. Soil water flow through the Bs horizon does not influence the release of NO(3)-N. We argue that the mechanisms by which the above factors influence the release of DOC and N are probably strongly associated with moisture-dependent biological activity, which governs the turnover of organic matter in the soil and limits the availability of NO(3)-N in the soil for leaching. We conclude that the release of DOC and N from upland headwaters dominated by podzolic soils is largely controlled by the variable interaction of hydrometeorological factors and moisture-dependent biological processes, and that a shift in climate towards drier summers and wetter winters may result in the release of DOC and N becoming increasingly variable and more episodic in the future.

AB Large raised bogs and patterned fens cover 56% of the landscape in the Glacial Lake Agassiz region of northern Minnesota (USA). Organic acids supply most of the acidity in the surface water of the bogs, but groundwater upwelling from the underlying glacial deposits neutralizes these organic acids within deep peat. Substantial concentrations of organic acids also occur in the surface waters of fens mixed with variable amounts of inorganic solutes contributed by groundwater discharge. We used a triprotic analog model to determine the extent to which organic acids in fen and bog waters behave as strong or weak acids. The modeling approach optimized charge balance by calibrating estimates of mole site density in the DOC (dissolved organic carbon) of surface and pore waters with estimates of triprotic acid dissociation constants. Before the calibration process, all of the bog waters and 76% of the fen waters had more than + 20% imbalance in charge balance. After calibration, more than 75% of all waters were electrochemically balanced within 20%. In the best calibration. the mole site denisty of bog DOC was estimated as similar to 0.05 mmol/mmol C., approximately six times smaller than that estimated for fen DOC or the DOC in the fen deeper fen peats that underlie all bog landforms. The three modeled de-protonation constants were; pK(a1) = similar to 3.0. pK(a2) = similar to 4.5 and pK(a3) = similar to 7.0 for the bog DOC, and; pK(a1) = similar to 5.2, pK(a2) = similar to 6.5 and pK(a3) = similar to 7.0 for the fen DOC. Bog DOC, behaves as a strong acid despite its small mole site density. The DOC in bog runoff can therefore theoretically acidify the surface waters in adjacent fens wherever these waters do not receive sufficient buffering alkalinity from active groundwater seepage.

AB Climate-induced changes in catchment area vegetation and runoff alter the quality and quantity of carbon that enters lakes, with implications for food webs in recipient water bodies. The effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the ratio between heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass and productivity was studied in a subarctic, clear water lake in northern Finland. In a mesocosm experiment, natural DOM from a subarctic bog and a boreal lake was added to the lake water, doubling the initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. Optical indices suggested that the subarctic DOM addition was more bioavailable, which was in line with the greater increase in bacterial biomass and production observed in this treatment. Both DOM additions increased the abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and decreased primary productivity. They also led to lower ratios of primary to bacterial production, autotrophic to mixotrophic algae and pigmented nanoflagellates (PNF) to HNF relative to the control samples, indicating a shift from a primary production-based food web towards one based on bacterial production. A comparable increase in DOM in the natural environment would lead to a considerable decrease in the euphotic layer and loss of areas available for primary production, resulting in a shift towards a heterotrophic production based food web.

AB The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) of peat, soil, and water samples collected from the Zoige wetlands on the eastern Tibetan Plateau in August 2008 were determined. The DOC concentration was 36.34 +/- 15.27 mg L-1, falling in the range of the DOC concentration in wetlands of other regions. However, the mean SUVA of the DOC was 0.55 +/- 0.33 L mg(-1) m(-1), showed a comparatively low aromaticity among wetlands. Significant variations of DOC concentration and their SUVA were both found under different spatial scales. The results showed that both the concentration and aromaticity of the DOC are influenced by the water table in the peatland. The significant difference of the DOC concentration among the three types of wetland showed the influence of plant growth on the DOC in the soils, and the SUVA indicated the different sources of the DOC in the different wetlands. The results also indicated that the DOC concentrations in stream water are consistent to the proportion of peatlands in the corresponding catchment.

AB This study compares the spatial and temporal variability of water colour for fifteen sub-catchments of the River Nidd, northeast England, in 1986 and 2006/2007. Between 1986 and 2006/2007, mean annual water colour increased in all the sub-catchments. However, there was considerable variation in the increase, which ranged from 22 to 155%. Statistical analysis revealed that the sub-catchments could be split into two 'types' based on water chemistry and therefore dominant source of runoff; type 1 where flow was dominated by runoff from peat and type 2 where a greater contribution of flow appears to originate from mineral soil horizons, as indicated by the higher silicon, base cation concentrations and pH values. Largest proportional increases in water colour were observed in the sub-catchments that had the smaller mean annual water colour values in 1986 which were, in general, the type 2 sub-catchments. The higher rate of water colour increase in the type 2 catchments, in comparison to the type 1 catchments, may be related to changes in adsorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within the mineral horizons of the organo-mineral soils on the lower catchment slopes possibly as a result of changes in acid sulphur deposition.

AB Rivers link terrestrial and marine biospheres by transporting carbon from land to ocean and by exchanging CO2 with the atmosphere. In an attempt to quantify the aquatic carbon cycle, we developed a technique based on carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) and oxygen isotopic composition of dissolved oxygen (delta O-18(DO)). The approach was tested on selected boreal ecosystems in the Ottawa area, Canada: Meech Lake; the Ottawa River; and Green Creek, the latter dewatering the Mer Bleue bog. The three ecosystems were monitored for 1 yr and the calculated aquatic respiration/photosynthesis ratios in general fell within the 1 to 3.5 ranges. The ecosystems were respiration dominated year-round, despite increased photosynthetic rates during the warm season, a development that was apparently matched by a comparable enhancement in respiration rates. The year-round predominance of respiration over photosynthesis supports the results of earlier studies, showing that boreal aquatic ecosystems, particularly the lakes, are not solely dissipation pathways for soil-generated CO2 introduced into surficial water bodies by groundwater input. To fuel this year-round "excess" respiration, the steady state balance consideration demands that the ecosystem must have a continuous supply of allochthonous reduced carbon.

ID PHOSPHORUS; MATTER
AB To evaluate the effects of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on phosphate retention (including both sorption and/or precipitation reactions) on soils, experiments were performed by using two typical calcareous soils from southeastern Spain (Calcic Regosol and Luvic Xerosol) and two different types of DOC: (1) extracts from a commercial peat (DOC-PE) and (2) high-purity tannic acid (DOC-TA). The experiments were carried out from a 0.01 M CaCl2 aqueous medium at 25 degreesC. The results obtained show that the presence of both DOC-PE and DOC-TA, over a concentration range of 15 (DOC-15) to 100 (DOC-100) mg L-1, produces in all cases a decreasing amount of phosphate retained in the soils studied, the decrease observed being higher when DOC-PE is used as source of DOC. The values of the decrease observed when DOC-PE was added ranged between 19.9% (DOC-15) and 15.6% (DOC-100) for the Calcic Regosol and between 17.3% (DOC-70, DOC-100) and 14.6% (DOC-15) for the Luvic Xerosol. The variation observed when DOC-TA was added ranged between 8.5% (DOC-100) and 0.5% (DOC-35) for the Calcic Regosol and between 7.0% (DOC-100) and 1.0% (DOC-15) for the Luvic Xerosol.

AB Few studies have quantified the role of in-stream processes on net dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively) export from peatland catchments, and those that have offer conflicting evidence. In this study, we evaluated evidence for active organic matter processing under field conditions, via a coordinated campaign across four UK catchments with peatland headwaters, targeted on potential 'hotspots' and 'hot moments' of physico-chemical carbon cycling. We hypothesised that specific hotspots and hot moments would occur where waters enriched with DOC and POC sourced from headwaters are exposed to: (1) mixing with freshwaters of different pH, conductivity and metal concentrations; and (2) mixing with seawater during autumn when DOC concentrations were at their highest. We observed instances of POC removal in headwaters, and potential for rapid conversion between dissolved and particulate carbon forms and for net removal of peat-derived carbon at confluences further downstream (where observed, on the order of 52-75 % for POC, and 5-44 % for DOC). Estuary transect surveys indicated that up to 30 % of fluvial DOC can be removed under high flow conditions. However, in the majority of cases concentrations remained within the range that would be expected based on conservative transport. These findings indicate that rapid (e.g. solubility-related) processes within the river system may be important but sporadic, thus are unlikely to provide major removal pathways for peat-derived organic carbon.

AB Mangroves experience stress or mortality when gas exchange by aerial root structures is hindered by sediment burial or constant inundation. The resulting loss of belowground roots and increased decomposition can lead to a loss of surface elevation through peat collapse, furthering the degree of inundation. This study identified ten live mangrove forests across Tampa Bay (Florida, USA) with stagnant water and/or abundant adventitious root growth (a sign of stress) and compared vegetative, water, and soil characteristics of stressed and reference mangrove forests to identify early indicators of stress and potential peat collapse. Two stressed sites were characterized by sandy, high-density soils and were hypothesized to have been stressed by a burial event. The remaining eight stressed locations had stagnant pools of discolored water with low dissolved oxygen (1.1 +/- 1.3 mg L-1). Soil from the hydrologic stress sites had significantly lower dry bulk density than reference mangrove sites (0.24 +/- 0.14 g cm(-3) vs. 0.40 +/- 0.11 g cm(-3)), greater organic matter composition (49.3 +/- 17.2% vs. 26.1 +/- 9.0%), and a higher proportion of root material. Salinity and porewater dissolved organic carbon varied widely but were not significantly different between reference and hydrologic stress sites. Altered hydrology due to anthropogenic alteration can often be improved; thus, proactive restoration is recommended to prevent mortality and peat collapse in affected mangrove forests.

AB The boreal biome exchanges large amounts of carbon (C) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) with the atmosphere and thus significantly affects the global climate. A managed boreal landscape consists of various sinks and sources of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) across forests, mires, lakes, and streams. Due to the spatial heterogeneity, large uncertainties exist regarding the net landscape carbon balance (NLCB). In this study, we compiled terrestrial and aquatic fluxes of CO2, CH4, DOC, DIC, and harvested C obtained from tall-tower eddy covariance measurements, stream monitoring, and remote sensing of biomass stocks for an entire boreal catchment (68 km(2)) in Sweden to estimate the NLCB across the land-water-atmosphere continuum. Our results showed that this managed boreal forest landscape was a net C sink (NLCB = 39 g C m(-2) year(-1)) with the landscape-atmosphere CO2 exchange being the dominant component, followed by the C export via harvest and streams. Accounting for the global warming potential of CH4, the landscape was a GHG sink of 237 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1), thus providing a climate-cooling effect. The CH4 flux contribution to the annual GHG budget increased from 0.6% during spring to 3.2% during winter. The aquatic C loss was most significant during spring contributing 8% to the annual NLCB. We further found that abiotic controls (e.g., air temperature and incoming radiation) regulated the temporal variability of the NLCB whereas land cover types (e.g., mire vs. forest) and management practices (e.g., clear-cutting) determined their spatial variability. Our study advocates the need for integrating terrestrial and aquatic fluxes at the landscape scale based on tall-tower eddy covariance measurements combined with biomass stock and stream monitoring to develop a holistic understanding of the NLCB of managed boreal forest landscapes and to better evaluate their potential for mitigating climate change.

TI Long-term trends in catchment export and lake retention of dissolved

AB Annual catchment export of total phosphorus (TP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total iron (Fe), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to seven lakes in central Ontario was measured between 1978 and 1998. Fluctuations in annual water discharge and total DOC load (including precipitation) to the lakes over the 20-year period were similar in the seven study lakes. DOC export to the lakes responded proportionally to changes in discharge, decreasing during drier and warmer years. There were similar but less accentuated variations in annual DOC lake concentrations. There were no clear regional trends evident during the 20-year period toward drier or wetter conditions, less DOC load, clearer lakes, etc., that could be interpreted as signaling a shift toward a different equilibrium state. The fraction of the DOC load retained by lakes (transferred to sediments and the atmosphere) increased during an extended dry period. Fe, TP, and DON export decreased more than DOC export during the extended dry period. Runoff appears to affect Fe, TP, and DON export first by controlling export of organic matter and second by affecting water table position and thus redox levels in the surface layer of peatlands. Permanently drier conditions with less runoff would likely lead to clearer lakes that are less productive. Conversely, increased runoff would lead to more colored and productive lakes. Both scenarios have implications for subsistence and sport fishing economies.

AB The fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) enable comparisons of humic-like (H-L) and fulvic-like (F-L) fluorescence intensities with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic systems. The fluorescence-DOC relationship differed in gradient, i.e. the fluorescence per gram of carbon, and in the strength of the correlation coefficient. We compare the fluorescence intensity of the F-L and H-L fractions and DOC of freshwater DOM in north Shropshire, England, featuring a river, wetland, spring, pond and sewage DOM sources. Correlations between fluorescence and DOC varied between sample sites. Wetland water samples for the F-L peak gave the best correlation, r = 0.756; the lowest correlation was from final treated sewage effluent, r = 0.167. The relationship between fluorescence and DOC of commercially available International Humic Substances Society standards were also examined and they generally showed a lower fluorescence per gram of carbon for the F-L peak than the natural samples, whereas peat wetland DOM gave a greater fluorescence per gram of carbon than river DOM. Here, we propose the strength of the fluorescence-DOC correlation to be a useful tool when discriminating sources of DOM in fresh water. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Iron is a micronutrient of particular interest as low levels of iron limit primary production of phytoplankton and carbon fluxes in extended regions of the world's oceans. Sphagnum-peatland runoff is extraordinarily rich in dissolved humic-bound iron. Given that several of the world's largest wetlands are Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, this ecosystem type may serve as one of the major sources of iron to the ocean. Here, we studied five near-coastal creeks in North Scotland using freshwater/seawater mixing experiments of natural creek water and synthetic seawater based on a Fe-59 radiotracer technique combined with isotopic characterization of dissolved organic carbon by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. Three of the creeks meander through healthy Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs and the two others through modified peatlands which have been subject to artificial drainage for centuries. The results revealed that, at the time of sampling (August 16-24, 2014), the creeks that run through modified peatlands delivered 11-15 mu g iron per liter creek water to seawater, whereas the creeks that run through intact peatlands delivered 350-470 mu g iron per liter creek water to seawater. To find out whether this humic-bound iron is bio-available to marine algae, we performed algal growth tests using the unicellular flagellated marine prymnesiophyte Diacronema lutheri and the unicellular marine green alga Chlorella salina, respectively. In both cases, the riverine humic material provided a highly bio-available source of iron to the marine algae. These results add a new item to the list of ecosystem services of Sphagnum-peatlands.

AB Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) are upland wetlands, similar to fens in the Northern Hemisphere and are found at the headwaters of low-order streams on the plateaus of Eastern Australia. They are classified as endangered ecological communities under State and National legislation. Previous works have identified particular geomorphic characteristics that are important to carbon storage in these low energy sediment accumulation zones. Changes in the geomorphic structure of THPSS, such as channelisation, may have profound implications for carbon storage. To assess the effect of channelisation on carbon budgets in these ecosystems it is essential to identify and quantify differences in carbon export, emissions and stocks of carbon of intact swamps and those that have become channelised. We undertook seasonal sampling of the perched swamp aquifers and surface waters of two intact swamps and two channelised fills in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia, to investigate differences in carbon exports and emissions between the two swamp types. We found that channelised fills' mean CO2 emissions were almost four times higher than intact swamps with mean CH4 emissions up to five times higher. Annual fluvial carbon exports for channelised fills were up to 18 times that of intact swamps. Channelised fill exports and emissions can represent up to 2% of the total swamp carbon stocks per annum which is 40 times higher than the intact swamps. This work clearly demonstrates that changes in geomorphic structure brought about by incision and channelisation results in profound changes to the carbon storage function of THPSS.

AB Perennial pools are common natural features of peatlands, and their hydrological functioning and turnover may be important for carbon fluxes, aquatic ecology, and downstream water quality. Peatland restoration methods such as ditch blocking result in many new pools. However, little is known about the hydrological function of either pool type. We monitored six natural and six artificial pools on a Scottish blanket peatland. Pool water levels were more variable in all seasons in artificial pools having greater water level increases and faster recession responses to storms than natural pools. Pools overflowed by a median of 9 and 54 times pool volume per year for natural and artificial pools, respectively, but this varied widely because some large pools had small upslope catchments and vice versa. Mean peat water-table depths were similar between natural and artificial pool sites but much more variable over time at the artificial pool site, possibly due to a lower bulk specific yield across this site. Pool levels and pool-level fluctuations were not the same as those of local water tables in the adjacent peat. Pool-level time series were much smoother, with more damped rainfall or recession responses than those for peat water tables. There were strong hydraulic gradients between the peat and pools, with absolute water tables often being 20-30 cm higher or lower than water levels in pools only 1-4 m away. However, as peat hydraulic conductivity was very low (median of 1.5 x 10(-5) and 1.4 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) at 30 and 50 cm depths at the natural pool site), there was little deep subsurface flow interaction. We conclude that (a) for peat restoration projects, a larger total pool surface area is likely to result in smaller flood peaks downstream, at least during summer months, because peatland bulk specific yield will be greater; and (b) surface and near-surface connectivity during storm events and topographic context, rather than pool size alone, must be taken into account in future peatland pool and stream chemistry studies.

AB Precipitation patterns are becoming increasingly extreme, particularly at northern latitudes. Current climate models predict that this trend will continue in the future. While droughts have been repeatedly studied in many ecosystems over the last decades, the consequences of increasingly intense, but less frequent rainfall events, on carbon (C) cycling are not well understood. At northern latitudes, peatlands store one third of the terrestrial carbon and their functioning is highly dependent on water. Shifts in rainfall regimes could disrupt peatland C dynamics and speed-up the rates of C loss. How will these immense stocks of C be able to withstand and recover from extreme rainfall? We tested the resistance and resilience effects of extreme precipitation regimes on peatland carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes, pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and litter decomposition rates by exposing intact peat cores to extreme, spring-time rainfall patterns in a controlled mesocosm experiment. We find that more intense but less frequent rainfall destabilized water table dynamics, with cascading effects on peatland C fluxes. Decomposition and respiration rates increased with a deeper mean water table depth (WTD) and larger WTD fluctuations. We observed similar patterns for CO2 uptake, which were likely mediated by improved vascular plant performance. After a three-week recovery period, CO2 fluxes still displayed responses to the earlier WTD dynamics, suggesting lagged effects of precipitation regime shifts. Furthermore, we found that CH4 emissions decreased with deeper mean WTD, but this showed a high resilience once WTD dynamics stabilised. Not only do our results illustrate that shifting rainfall patterns translate in altered WTD dynamics and, consequentially, influence C fluxes, they also demonstrate that exposure to altered rainfall early in the growing season can have lasting effects on CO2 exchange. Even though the increased CO2 assimilation under extreme precipitation patterns signals peatland resistance under changing climatic conditions, it may instead mark the onset of vascular plant encroachment and the associated C loss.

AB We investigated species composition and relative abundance of Sphagnum fallax dominated peatlands in relation to measured environmental variables on the basis of 26 sites in the Wielkopolska region. Most studied plots were characterized by soft waters, poor in Ca2+ but rich in nutrients, especially N-NH4 (+) and P-PO4 (3-), with high electrolytic conductivity and high DOC (dissolved organic carbon) concentration. Six of the 19 measured variables of surface water chemistry (DOC, pH, SO4 (2-), P-PO4 (3-), Na+ and Ca2+) significantly explained 23% of the variation in floristic composition. In 65 vegetation plots, 107 species were observed. Cluster analysis revealed four types of vegetation in the studied mires. Sphagnum fallax was the most abundant species and formed plant communities in a wide range of habitats: in floating mats, with the plants usually adjoining the mineral basin edge (e.g. E. vaginatum, Andromeda polifolia and Ledum palustre) as well as it occupied central parts of Sphagnum lawn (e.g. Eriophorum angustifolium) and rich fen habitats (e.g. Carex rostrata or Phragmites australis). In Wielkopolska terrestrializating peatlands, four variables determine the poor-rich gradient: conductivity, DOC, SiO2 dissolved, Ca2+ and alkalinity. This study provides new data on the ecology and typology of Sphagnum peatlands in western Poland.

AB Discolouration of natural surface waters due to the humic component of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a costly problem for water supply companies. This paper reviews what is known about the impacts of prescribed moorland vegetation burning on water colour. Relevant research has taken place at three scales: laboratory experiments on peat cores, plot scale sampling of soil waters and catchment scale sampling of stream waters. While laboratory studies suggest burning increases colour production, the evidence from catchment and plot studies is contradictory. Plot studies suggest colour production may decrease or remain unchanged following burning although there is evidence for some transient changes. Catchment studies suggest prescribed moorland burning causes stream water colour to increase, although in most cases the evidence is not clear cut since most studies could not clearly disentangle the effects of burning from those of vegetation cover. The differences in findings between plot and catchment studies may be explained by: i) the short-term nature of some studies which do not measure long-term response and recovery times to burning; ii) the lack of colour measurements from shallow soil depths which contribute more to streamflow than soil water from deeper in the peat; and iii) the possibility of hydrological interactions occurring between different experimental plots at some sites. Additionally, the increase in recent patch burning in some catchments that has been statistically attributed by some authors to increases in stream water colour cannot be reconciled with theoretical calculations. When dilution with waters derived from other parts of the catchment are taken into account, large values of colour have to be theoretically derived from those recently burnt areas that occupy a small proportion of the catchment area in order to balance the change in stream water colour observed in recent years. Therefore, much further process-based work is required to properly investigate whether prescribed vegetation burning is a direct driver of enhanced colour and DOC in upland streams, rivers and lakes.

AB Winter climate change may result in reduced snow cover and could, consequently, alter the soil frost regime and biogeochemical processes underlying the exchange of methane (CH4) in boreal peatlands. In this study, we investigated the short-term (1-3years) vs. long-term (11years) effects of intensified winter soil frost (induced by experimental snow exclusion) on CH4 exchange during the following growing season in a boreal peatland. In the first 3years (2004-2006), lower CH4 emissions in the treatment plots relative to the control coincided with delayed soil temperature increase in the treatment plots at the beginning of the growing season (May). After 11 treatment years (in 2014), CH4 emissions were lower in the treatment plots relative to the control over the entire growing season, resulting in a reduction in total growing season CH4 emission by 27%. From May to July 2014, reduced sedge leaf area coincided with lower CH4 emissions in the treatment plots compared to the control. From July to August, lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the pore water of the treatment plots explained 72% of the differences in CH4 emission between control and treatment. In addition, greater Sphagnum moss growth in the treatment plots resulted in a larger distance between the moss surface and the water table (i.e., increasing the oxic layer) which may have enhanced the CH4 oxidation potential in the treatment plots relative to the control in 2014. The differences in vegetation might also explain the lower temperature sensitivity of CH4 emission observed in the treatment plots relative to the control. Overall, this study suggests that greater soil frost, associated with future winter climate change, might substantially reduce the growing season CH4 emission in boreal peatlands through altering vegetation dynamics and subsequently causing vegetation-mediated effects on CH4 exchange.

AB Peatlands are among the largest long-term soil carbon stores on the globe, but their degradation can lead to significant carbon losses. Therefore, restoration of peatlands has received considerable attention but the impact of revegetation upon critical water quality parameters has not been assessed. In this paper we consider a 5-year study of three restored sites in comparison to both an unrestored, bare peat control and to a vegetated control that did not require restoration. The soil porewater dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) was measured (6 replicates) for each restoration treatment and each control. The soil water measurements were made in the context of measuring the depth to water table; soil water pH and conductivity; and DOC concentration in surface runoff for the same restored and control treatment. The study showed that the average soil porewater DOC concentration on the restored sites rose significantly over the 5 year study representing a 34% increase relative to the vegetated control and an 11% increase relative to the unrestored, bare control. Soil pore water concentrations were not significantly different from surface runoff DOC concentrations, and therefore restoration as conducted by this study would have contributed to water quality deterioration in the catchment. However, had water table restoration been conducted alongside revegetation then a significant decline in DOC concentrations could have been realised. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Cudahy "Fauna" was named by C.W. Hibbard for a fossil assemblage recovered from silty clays beneath the "Pearlette" volcanic ash at the type Cudahy ash pit and other sites in Meade County, Kansas. The "Pearlette" ash comprises several variously dated Yellowstone ashes. The Cudahy (=Lava Creek B) ash is most recently dated at 0.639 +/- 0.002 Ma and is an important geochronologic marker in the Great Plains. The term Cudahy Ash Pit local fauna is now used for that of the type locality, although other Cudahy-type (Cudahyan) local faunas have been described. From 1968 to 1971, 30 tons of silty clay and diatomite were collected from below outcrops of Lava Creek B ash at elevations of 988-1058 m (3240-3470 ft) in the High Plains of the Texas Panhandle. Screenwashing yielded about 30 mammal taxa and numerous small amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mollusks. Four local faunas (Woody Draw, Bull Draw, Deadman's Creek, and Mayfield Ranch) are recognized. These faunas, dominated by shrews and microtine (arvicoline) rodents, are compositionally similar to each other and to the Cudahy and Sunbrite ash pit local faunas of Meade County even though the Panhandle sites are 300-340 km (186-211 miles) southwest of the Kansas sites and are 213-280 m (700-920 ft) higher in elevation. The Panhandle faunas contain two new species of Sorex as well as Sorex cf. cinereus, Sorex cudahyensis, Sorex lacustris, Sorex (Microsorex) pratensis, Sorex megapalustris, Blarina, Cynomys, Spermophilus, Geomys tobinensis, Thomomys cf. talpoides, Peromyscus cragini, Reithrodontomys moorei, Ondatra annectens, Mictomys meltoni, Microtus Ilanensis (rare), Microtus paroperarius, and Microtus meadensis. The large sample size of the latter two taxa permits statistical comparisons of teeth with those from Kansas. The Texas faunas further substantiate the Cudahyan as a subage of the Irvingtonian between the older Sappan and younger Sheridanian subages and equivalent to Irvingtonian II based on microtine (arvicoline) rodents. Local habitats consisted of ponds or playas with marshy areas suitable for shrews, muskrats, and bog lemmings. Moist grassy meadows nearby would have been inhabited by voles, mice, and some of the shrews; the less abundant gophers, ground squirrels, and prairie dog would have preferred drier, grassy uplands with well-drained soils. Several mammals (e.g. bog lemming) show affinities with extant boreal species that range through Canada and the northern United States The collective evidence suggests that the Texas Panhandle enjoyed cooler summers with more effective rainfall during Cudahy time.

AB The effect of climate change on peatlands is of great importance due to their large carbon stocks. In this study, we examined microbial biomass and effect of temperature and O-2 availability on soil respiration of surface and subsurface Sphagnum peat. The interactive effect of biotic and abiotic factors significantly affects soil respiration. Increasing temperature enhanced the microbial respiratory activity and thus the soil respiration, while there is a temperature threshold. The more decomposed subsurface peat showed a lower CO2 production due to less labile carbon and lower microbial biomass, but a higher temperature sensitivity. Q(10) of aerobic respiration increased from 1.93 +/- 0.26 in surface to 2.20 +/- 0.01 in subsurface peat. The linear relationship between Q(10) and depth in the uppermost 50 cm peat section can be used to improve the estimation of CO2 production in peat profiles.

AB We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes across air-water interface with floating chambers in Lake Medo (a small, shallow lake in peatland) on the eastern Tibetan Plateau in the warm season of 2009. During the study period, mean CO2 fluxes was 488.63 +/- 1,036.17 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1). The flux rate was high compared to those of lakes in other regions, and represented a "hotspot" of CO2 evasion. Temporal variation of CO2 flux was significant, with the peak value in the beginning and lowest point in the end of warm season. High concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lake water (WDOC) was found to highly correlated to CO2 flux (R = 0.47, P < 0.01, n = 54). Besides, fluorescence index of WDOC showed its terrestrial origin character. In accordance with lakes in northern and boreal regions, terrestrial DOC concentration in water column was the most important regulator of CO2 flux from this lake. We suggest that large area of peatlands in catchments support high concentration of DOC in this lake, and consequently high CO2 evasion.

AB Bacterial abundance, temperature, pH, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration were compared across surface sites within and between two northern Wisconsin Sphagnum peatlands over the summer seasons in 1995 and 1996. Sites of interest were the Sphagnum mat surface, the water-filled moat (lagg) at the bug margin, and the bog lake littoral zone. Significant differences in both bacterial populations and water chemistry were observed between sites. pH was highest in the lake and lowest in the mat at both bugs; the opposite was true for DOG. Large populations of bacteria were present in surface interstitial water from the mat; abundance in this site was consistently higher than in the moat or lake. Bacterial abundance also increased across sites of increasing DOC concentration and declining pH. Bacterial activities (rates of [H-3]leucine incorporation) and growth in dilution cultures (with grazers removed) were also assessed in lake, moat, and mat sites. Results using these measures generally supported the trends observed in abundance, although high rates of [H-3]leucine incorporation were recorded in the moat at one of the bogs. Our results indicate that bacterial populations in Sphagnum peatlands are not adversely affected by acidity, and that DOC may be more important than pH in determining bacterial abundance in these environments.

AB The seasonal and spatial changes of content and composition of dissolved organic carbon in water flowing out from bog were studied. Water was sampled from the Kuke River flowing out from Koigi Bog (eastern Saaremaa, Estonia) and in comparison the water samples from the bog lake (Lake Pitkjarv) were analyzed regularly during 18 months. Absorptions of water samples were measured at 250, 254, 285, 365 and 436 nm on UV-Vis spectrophotometer and pH, conductivity and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured. Specific ultraviolet absorptions (SUVA) and the ratios of absorptions were calculated to characterize the nature of dissolved organic carbons. The significant changes of the concentration of DOC were determined in water sampled from the Kuke River during the dry days, but it was much steadier during rest sampling time. Analysis of water from the Lake Pitkjarv showed relatively high content of macromolecular organic compounds rich in aromatics (SUVA(254) = 4.58 L mg(-1) m(-1)), whereas water samples from the Kuke River contained predominantly more homogeneous low-molecular-weight materials poor in aromatics (SUVA(254) = 2.96 L mg(-1) m(-1)). Calculated values of SUVA(285) confirmed that organic carbon in river water can be also originated from the decomposition of root litter. The values of ratio of UVA(250)/A(365) for water samples from Kuke River indicated the fulvic nature of DOC as conformed by the SUVA(254) and SUVA(285) values. The values of A(254)/A(436) for river were higher than 14 indicating that the organic matter in water from lake and river contained lots of UV absorbing functional groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Shallow hillslope groundwater is shown to be a dominant source of streamflow in sloping bog-forest uplands of the North Coast Forest District, British Columbia, based on a three-component isotope hydrograph-separation analysis conducted in July 1998. At peak discharge during a mid-summer rainfall event, new water contributions accounted for only 12% of streamflow, whereas shallow groundwater accounted For 85% of streamflow and bog groundwater and deep hillslope groundwater accounted for the remaining 3% of streamflow. Mean residence time of water is estimated to be about 2 months, and soil storage capacity is roughly 400 mm based on the analysis of the baseflow discharge and isotopic response. Systematic seasonal shifts in deuterium excess of rainfall in the Prince Rupert area are shown to be useful for labelling shallow and deep groundwaters based on their residence time signatures. The potential for using dissolved organic carbon and deuterium excess as hydrological tracers is also discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Resin Productivity of Pine after Partial Logging on the Hydrotechnical
   Reclamation Site
SO LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE pine tapping; hydrotechnical reclamation; partial logging; environmental
   factors; diagnosis of pine trees
AB Integrated use of coniferous forest resources is a natural necessity of sustainable environment conservancy. Hydrological forest reclamation systems in coniferous boreal forests imply the development of specific management regime including silvicultural tending and partial logging. Spectrum broadening of products obtained in forest land exploitation should be achieved by the means of lifetime and minor use. Production of pine turpentine (sap) allows to obtain valuable forest chemical raw materials for the number of industries. Influence of forest drainage and partial logging on resin productivity is one of the insufficiently provided research issues in forestry. On the example of Sokol'skiy District of Vologda Region, the influence of location of pine trees (towards the channels of regulating network and forest belts), left for completion of growing after partial logging, on the pine sap exudation under closed tapping was studied. It was established that the drainage system channels in the felling site area were in satisfactory condition from 1972 till 2015. The highest resin productivity of pine forests was observed in July and the lowest in August. One of the forest belts had the highest resin productivity in the center and at the edge of the swath in 2013 and 2015; and in the channel area in 2013 and 2014. Resin productivity at the felling site is 1.4 times higher than in the control area (under the drainage conditions). This proves the positive effect from selective tree cutting in logging for resin exudation from the part of trees remained after tapping. Three years of studies have shown that the variability of resin exudation at the edge of the swath is 9 % less than in the center of the swath. No apparent fluctuations have been found in the channel and interchannel areas of the drained belt. The study has proved that soil and air temperature, and valuation diameter of sample trees involved into tapping can affect the resin exudation. A significant correlation with the temperature of underlying surface was registered in July and August and with the soil temperature in July. The air temperature at the level of resin blaze location of the sample trees affects the resin exudation mostly in June. It turned out that the correlation between resin exudation and valuation diameter of trees is stronger in the channel area and at the edge of swath than in the center of interchannel area. Probably, it depends on the microclimate and hydrological features after draining and partial logging that results in more comfortable conditions for growth (higher illumination). The turpentine production in drained pine forests requires carrying out partial cuttings of moderate intensity by reserves and intensive tapping at the edges of belts (logging area) left for completion of growing. In drained pine forests on peat soils, tapping with greater intensity should be carried out in the channel areas (along the drainage channels).

AB We measured seasonal patterns in the fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in a forested wetland in central New York State front 1992 to 1995. The site was a red maple-hemlock swamp with permanent pools (similar to 30 cm deep), except when, the pools dried during severe drought in 1995. Annual CH4 emissions from the pools to the atmosphere averaged 4.3 (+/-2.4) mol m(-2) during 1993 to 1995 and ranged from 1.9 mol m(-2) in 1993 to 6.7 mol m(-2) in 1995. CO2 emissions from the pools during 1993 and 1994 were 10.5 and 11.9 mol m(-2) accounting for 84.6% and 75.6% of the gaseous carbon export during 1993 and 1994, respectively. A combination of temperature and carbon availability influenced seasonal CH4 and CO2 fluxes more than other environmental factors (temperature, water column depth, O-2, CH4, dissolved organic carbon, NH4+, or dissolved inorganic carbon). Based on an observed 12 degrees C threshold temperature, linear regression models explained from 31% to 77% of seasonal gas flux variability Compared with other forested wetlands, this sire produced substantially greater CH4 fluxes, and the CH4 flux accounted for a greater proportion of the total carbon flux from the system.

AB The export of fixed carbon from peatlands is likely important in driving freshwater ecosystem productivity in head water streams. Here we studied the stream composition from three peatlands, and the sub-catchment containing these peatlands, in response to a natural storm event. We investigated the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) mobilised by this event as well as the dissolved combined amino acids (DCAAs; proteins, peptides and free AAs) component of the DOC/DON. The storm pulse was characterised by a strong DOC/DON/DCAA pulse reflecting the mobilisation of materials from the peat profile. Through the storm cycle a transient increase in the C:N ratio of the DOC was observed (ranging over 20 - 50 across the four sites), likely reflecting the mobilisation of less decomposed material from higher in the peat soil profile. By comparing the DCAA and DON dynamics we show that a DCAA-rich component (fast-DCAA) is mobilised earlier in the storm cycle, likely reflecting a higher mobility in the peat soil. Similarly, comparison of the DCAA and DOC dynamics suggests that at least part of the DOC is mobilised more rapidly than fast-DCAA (fast-DOC). While we may not expect the composition of a storm pulse to be uniform through the cycle, this study shows that within the DOC and DON pools there is spatial and temporal separation of molecular groups. Proteins (in principal) represent both highly bioavailable N-sources as well as potential biological trigger molecules, so our work shows that these compounds are more dominant in the early part (rising limb) of the storm pulse. This understanding of the changing composition of DOC through a storm peak also provides greater insight into the concentration-discharge (C-Q) response of peatlands; our work shows that the activation of water paths higher in the peat profile at high flows leads to the mobilisation of different pools of DOC such that the molecular characteristics of DOC change through the storm cycle.

AB Plant communities play an important role in the C-sink function of peatlands. However, global change and local perturbations are expected to modify peatland plant communities, leading to a shift from Sphagnum mosses to vascular plants. Most studies have focused on the direct effects of modification in plant communities or of global change (such as climate warming, N fertilization) in peatlands without considering interactions between these disturbances that may alter peatlands' C function. We set up a mesocosm experiment to investigate how Greenhouse Gas (CO2, CH4, N2O) fluxes, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved N (TN) contents are affected by a shift from Sphagnum mosses to Mania caerulea dominated peatlands combined with N fertilization. Increasing N deposition did not alter the C fluxes (CO2 exchanges, CH4 emissions) or DOC content. The lack of N effect on the C cycle seems due to the capacity of Sphagnum to efficiently immobilize N. Nevertheless, N supply increased the N2O emissions, which were also controlled by the plant communities with the presence of Molinia caerulea reducing N2O emissions in the Sphagnum mesocosms. Our study highlights the role of the vegetation composition on the C and N fluxes in peatlands and their responses to the N deposition. Future research should now consider the climate change in interaction to plants community modifications due to their controls of peatland sensitivity to environmental conditions.

AB Peatlands are important sources of fluvial carbon. Previous research has shown that riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations are largely controlled by soil type. However, there has been little work to establish the controls of riverine DOC within blanket peatlands that have not undergone major disturbance from drainage or burning. A total of 119 peatland catchments were sampled for riverine DOC and water colour across three drainage basins during six repeated sampling campaigns. The topographic characteristics of each catchment were determined from digital elevation models. The dominant vegetation cover was mapped using 0.5 m resolution colour infrared aerial images, with ground-truthed validation revealing 82% accuracy. Forward and backward stepwise regression modelling showed that mean slope was a strong (and negative) determinant of DOC and water colour in blanket peatland river waters. There was a weak role for plant functional type in determining DOC and water colour. At the basin scale, there were major differences between the models depending on the basin. The dominance of topographic predictors of DOC found in our study, combined with a weaker role of vegetation type, paves the way for developing improved planning tools for water companies operating in peatland catchments. Using topographic data and aerial imagery it will be possible to predict which tributaries will typically yield lower DOC concentrations and which are therefore more suitable and cost-effective as raw water intakes.

AB A large amount of organic carbon is stored in high-latitude soils. A substantial proportion of this carbon stock is vulnerable and may decompose rapidly due to temperature increases that are already greater than the global average. It is therefore crucial to quantify and understand carbon exchange between the atmosphere and subarctic/arctic ecosystems. In this paper, we combine an Arctic-enabled version of the process-based dynamic ecosystem model, LPJ-GUESS (version LPJG-WHyMe-TFM) with comprehensive observations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes to simulate long-term carbon exchange in a subarctic catchment at 50m resolution. Integrating the observed carbon fluxes from aquatic systems with the modeled terrestrial carbon fluxes across the whole catchment, we estimate that the area is a carbon sink at present and will become an even stronger carbon sink by 2080, which is mainly a result of a projected densification of birch forest and its encroachment into tundra heath. However, the magnitudes of the modeled sinks are very dependent on future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, comparisons of global warming potentials between two simulations with and without CO2 increase since 1960 reveal that the increased methane emission from the peatland could double the warming effects of the whole catchment by 2080 in the absence of CO2 fertilization of the vegetation. This is the first process-based model study of the temporal evolution of a catchment-level carbon budget at high spatial resolution, including both terrestrial and aquatic carbon. Though this study also highlights some limitations in modeling subarctic ecosystem responses to climate change, such as aquatic system flux dynamics, nutrient limitation, herbivory and other disturbances, and peatland expansion, our study provides one process-based approach to resolve the complexity of carbon cycling in subarctic ecosystems while simultaneously pointing out the key model developments for capturing complex subarctic processes.

AB Responses of near-surface permafrost and glacial ice to climate change are of particular significance for understanding long-term effects on global carbon cycling and carbon export by high-latitude northern rivers. Here we report 14C-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) values and dissolved organic matter optical data for the Yukon River, 15 tributaries of the Yukon River, glacial meltwater, and groundwater and soil water end-member sources draining to the Yukon River, with the goal of assessing mobilization of aged DOC within the watershed. Ancient DOC was associated with glacial meltwater and groundwater sources. In contrast, DOC from watersheds dominated by peat soils and underlain by permafrost was typically enriched in 14C indicating that degradation of ancient carbon stores is currently not occurring at large enough scales to quantitatively influence bulk DOC exports from those landscapes. On an annual basis, DOC exported was predominantly modern during the spring period throughout the Yukon River basin and became older through summer-fall and winter periods, suggesting that contributions of older DOC from soils, glacial meltwaters, and groundwater are significant during these months. Our data indicate that rapidly receding glaciers and increasing groundwater inputs will likely result in greater contributions of older DOC in the Yukon River and its tributaries in coming decades.

AB We used methane-production measurements of slurried peat to study controls of methane production in six contrasting Appalachian wetland sites.  The sites differed widely in plant-community composition and in rates of methane production, which varied from 3-mu-mol/L/day in slurried-peat samples from a shrub-dominated bog to 216-mu-mol/L/day in peat from a spruce-forested wetland.  Three controlling factors of methane production were examined:  organic-chemical components of the peat (e.g., hot-water soluble, sulfuric acid soluble, sulfuric acid insoluble), concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, and rates of sulfate reduction.  Peats from shrub-dominated sites contained mostly acid-insoluble organic matter, which was presumably recalcitrant to microbial decomposition.  In contrast, peats from moss-and sedge-dominated sites contained mostly acid-soluble organic matter, which was presumably labile.  Differences of organic-chemical components of the peat could explain about 50% of the variation in rates of methane production among samples from the sites.  Rates of sulfate reduction in peat samples were relatively high (5-397-mu-mol/L/day), despite low in situ concentrations of dissolved sulfate (< 250-mu-mol/L), but sulfate reduction was not well correlated with rates of methane production, nor were concentrations of dissolved organic carbon.  Amendments of methanol and trimethylamine to peat samples from any individual site did not stimulate rates of methane production.  In general but not always, glucose, hydrogen, and acetate amendments stimulated rates of methane production.  Sulfate amendments that stimulated sulfate reduction also inhibited methane production by 90%; however, reversal of the inhibition was achieved by acetate and hydrogen amendments.  Control of methane production in these organic-rich wetlands is related more to organic-chemical components of the peat than to the activity of coincident sulfate-reducing bacteria.

AB Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured in precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, and soil, peat and stream water in a 50 ha catchment with a central 5 ha swamp at Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec. DOC concentrations in precipitation were low (2.0 mg L-1), but increased in passage through the tree canopies as throughfall (9.1-14.6 mg L-1) and stemflow (23.1-30.1 mg L-1). For the period July 1-November 15, 1987, 0.5 g DOC m-2 was imported as precipitation, and forest canopies contributed a further 1.4-1.7 g m-2 to the soil surface. DOC concentrations were higher (46.0 and 67.6 mg L-1) in upland soil organic horizons, but decreased with depth because subsoil mineral horizons acted as a major sink of DOC. A laboratory experiment using leaf leachate revealed that subsoil horizons were able to adsorb DOC, with equilibrium DOC concentrations ranging from 3 to 19 mg L-1. Soil organic carbon appeared to be an important determinant of equilibrium DOC concentrations. The swamp was a major source of DOC, with an overall average DOC concentration of 58.6 mg L-1 and showed strong spatial and temporal variations related to hydrologic and thermal regimes. During base flow periods, stream DOC concentrations were small (< 3 mg L-1), dominated by water fed from springs draining upland soils. During high flows, stream DOC concentrations increased through the contribution of DOC-rich water originating in the swamp. Sources, sinks and transport of DOC are thus a function of a complex set of inter-related biotic and abiotic process.

AB Catchment export of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its downstream degradation in aquatic ecosystems are important components of landscape scale carbon balances. In order to assess the influence of peatland permafrost on river DOM characteristics, we sampled 65 rivers along a 900 km transect crossing into the southern discontinuous permafrost zone on the Boreal and Tundra Plains of western Canada. Catchment peatland cover and catchment location north or south of the permafrost boundary were found together to have strong influences on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM chemical composition. River DOC concentrations increased with catchment peatland cover, but were consistently lower for catchments north of the permafrost boundary. In contrast, protein fluorescence (PARAFAC analysis), was unrelated to catchment peatland cover but increased significantly in rivers north of the permafrost boundary. Humic and fulvic acid contribution to DOM fluorescence was lower in rivers draining catchments with large lakes than in other rivers, consistent with extensive photodegradation, but humic and fulvic acid fluorescence were also lower in rivers north of the permafrost boundary than in rivers to the south. We hypothesize that shifts in river DOM characteristics when crossing the permafrost boundary are related to the influence of permafrost on peatland hydrological connectivity to stream networks, peatland DOM characteristics and differences in DOM degradation within aquatic ecosystems.

AB As a significant fraction of carbon in inland waters, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays a crucial role in carbon cycling at a global scale. Understanding the linkages between variations in DOC and its dominant factors in lakes is critical for estimating its concentration on a larger scale. This study characterized the concentrations of DOC in the lakes of Tibet Plateau and explored the major underlying influencing factors. The overall mean concentration of DOC in these closed lakes had a mean value of 21.80 +/- 30.82 mg/L (mean +/- S.D.) and was higher than open lakes (F = 174.1, p < 0.05). The potential drivers for the concentration of DOC in the lakes of Tibet Plateau were conducted by the correlation analysis of DOC with the observed landscape, water quality variables, and climatic factors. The multiple regression model showed that 78% of DOC concentrations across the lakes could be explained by Shannon evenness index (SHEI) of landscape, slope, and landscape dominance index (LDI), of which SHEI explained the most substantial variations for the concentration of DOC. The changes in the concentrations of DOC in river-lake interaction were analyzed in Qinghai Lake watershed. The concentration of DOC in the Qinghai Lake water was higher than the surrounding rivers. Slope and the density of soil organic matter (SOM) in the Qinghai Lake watershed were responsible for the higher DOC in lake than rivers. The landscape had a significant influence on DOC in the lakes, and the dominant factor was SHEI. The results observed from this investigation further supplement the information of DOC in the inland waters with plateau lakes. Further, this study is expected to improve the understanding of the transport of DOC in the river-lake ecosystem.

AB In most high-latitude wetlands, carbon accumulation as peat represents a balance between plant net primary productivity and heterotrophic decomposition. We hypothesized that this assessment of ecosystem metabolism is incomplete as it does not include information on energy inputs from microalgae, which form complex biofilms with heterotrophic micro-organisms on the peat surface. To investigate the potential for algae (and associated exudates) to support heterotrophic metabolism under ambient and elevated nutrient levels, we conducted a factorial enrichment of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and carbon (glucose) in mesocosms with and without the presence of algae (using light-transparent and dark treatments, respectively) in an Alaskan fen. We measured respiration rates and changes in bacterial biomass to characterize the response of heterotrophic bacteria to our experimental treatments. During incubation assays, algae released up to 38% of their net productivity as exudates and there was a positive relationship between algal production and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon inside mesocosms. Elevated algal productivity in the presence of nutrient enrichment stimulated heterotrophic bacterial respiration and biomass. These responses did not occur with nutrient enrichment in the dark (without algae). The response of bacteria to algae was similar in magnitude to bacterial responses to glucose enrichment.Synthesis. We conclude that bacteria in this boreal fen were primarily limited by labile carbon, and this constraint was alleviated in the presence of elevated algal production. Consequently, algae may facilitate hotspots of microbial activity in northern peatlands, especially in conditions of greater nutrient availability associated with more variable hydrology expected for this region with ongoing climate change.

AB [1] We present a new, process-based model of soil and stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC): the Integrated Catchments Model for Carbon (INCA-C). INCA-C is the first model of DOC cycling to explicitly include effects of different land cover types, hydrological flow paths, in-soil carbon biogeochemistry, and surface water processes on in-stream DOC concentrations. It can be calibrated using only routinely available monitoring data. INCA-C simulates daily DOC concentrations over a period of years to decades. Sources, sinks, and transformation of solid and dissolved organic carbon in peat and forest soils, wetlands, and streams as well as organic carbon mineralization in stream waters are modeled. INCA-C is designed to be applied to natural and seminatural forested and peat-dominated catchments in boreal and temperate regions. Simulations at two forested catchments showed that seasonal and interannual patterns of DOC concentration could be modeled using climate-related parameters alone. A sensitivity analysis showed that model predictions were dependent on the mass of organic carbon in the soil and that in-soil process rates were dependent on soil moisture status. Sensitive rate coefficients in the model included those for organic carbon sorption and desorption and DOC mineralization in the soil. The model was also sensitive to the amount of litter fall. Our results show the importance of climate variability in controlling surface water DOC concentrations and suggest the need for further research on the mechanisms controlling production and consumption of DOC in soils.

AB Peatland ecosystems contain one-third of the world's soil carbon store and many have been exposed to drought leading to a loss of carbon. Understanding biogeochemical mechanisms affecting decomposition in peatlands is essential for improving resilience of ecosystem function to predicted climate change. We investigated biogeochemical changes along a chronosequence of hydrological restoration (dry eroded gully, drain-blocked < 2 years, drain blocked < 7 years and wet pristine site), and examined whether hydrological legacy alters the response of beta-glucosidase kinetics (i.e. type of inhibition) to short-term drying and waterlogging. In the dry eroded gully at depth, low phenolic concentrations were associated with enhanced beta-glucosidase enzyme activities (V-max) but short-term drying and waterlogging caused a significant increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and phenolics associated with increases in Vmax (enzyme production) and Km (indicative of competitive inhibition). Inhibition within the drain blocked and pristine sites at depth exhibited non-competitive inhibition (decreased Vmax), whilst uncompetitive inhibition (decreased Vmax and Km) occurred in surface peat explained by variation in humic substances and phenolics. These results suggest that loss of carbon by short-term drought or rewetting may occur from sites with a legacy of drought due to the release of non-inhibitory phenolics that permits enhanced enzyme activity.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; BOREAL; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; RESILIENCE; VEGETATION;
   PATTERNS
AB The potential of high severity wildfires to increase global terrestrial carbon emissions and exacerbate future climatic warming is of international concern. Nowhere is this more prevalent than within high latitude regions where peatlands have, over millennia, accumulated legacy carbon stocks comparable to all human CO2 emissions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Drying increases rates of peat decomposition and associated atmospheric and aquatic carbon emissions. The degree to which severe wildfires enhance drying under future climates and induce instability in peatland ecological communities and carbon stocks is unknown. Here we show that high burn severities increased post-fire evapotranspiration by 410% within a feather moss peatland by burning through the protective capping layer that restricts evaporative drying in response to low severity burns. High burn severities projected under future climates will therefore leave peatlands that dominate dry sub-humid regions across the boreal, on the edge of their climatic envelopes, more vulnerable to intense post-fire drying, inducing high rates of carbon loss to the atmosphere that amplify the direct combustion emissions.

AB Pools are common in northern peatlands but studies have seldom focused on their nutrient biogeochemistry, especially in relation to their morphological characteristics and through seasons. We determined the environmental characteristics controlling carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) biogeochemistry in pools and assessed their evolution over the course of the 2016 growing season in a subboreal ombrotrophic peatland of eastern Canada. We showed that water chemistry variations in 62 pools were significantly explained by depth (81.9%) and the surrounding vegetation type (14.8%), but not by pool area or shape. Shallow pools had larger dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and lower pH than deep pools, while pools surrounded by coniferous trees had more recalcitrant DOC than pools where vegetation was dominated by mosses. The influence of depth on pool biogeochemistry was confirmed by the seasonal survey of pools of different sizes with 47.1% of the variation in pool water chemistry over time significantly explained. Of this, 67.3% was explained by the interaction between time and pool size and 32.7% by pool size alone. P concentrations were small in all pools all summer long and combined with high N:P ratios, are indicative of P-limitation. Our results show that pool biogeochemistry is influenced by internal processes and highlight the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of nutrient biogeochemistry in ombrotrophic peatlands.

AB Humic substances (HSs) are precursors for the formation of hazardous disinfection by-products (DBPs) during chlorination of water. Various surrogate parameters have been used to investigate the generation of DBPs by HS precursors and the removal of these precursors by activated carbon treatment. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)- and ultraviolet absorbance (UVA(254))-based isotherms are commonly reported and presumed to be good predictors of the trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP). However, THMFP-based isotherms are rarely published such that the three types of parameters have not been compared directly. Batch equilibrium experiments on activated carbon were used to generate constant-initial-concentration sorption isotherms for well-characterized samples obtained from the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS). HSs representing type (fulvic acid [FA], humic acid [HA]), origin (aquatic, terrestrial), and geographical source (Nordic, Suwannee, Peat, Soil) were examined at pH 6 and pH 9. THMFP-based isotherms were generated and compared to determine if DOC- and UVA(254)-based isotherms were good predictors of the THMFP. The sorption process depended on the composition of the HSs and the chemical nature of the activated carbon, both of which were influenced by pH. Activated carbon removal of THM-precursors was pH- and HS-dependent. In some instances, the THMFP existed after UVA254 was depleted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands are significantly promoted by global nitrogen input for changing the rate of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and are substantially affected by soil labile carbon and nitrogen conversely. However, the driving mechanism by which soil labile carbon and nitrogen affect greenhouse gas emissions from wetland ecosystems under global nitrogen input is not well understood. Working out the driving factor of nitrogen input on greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands is critical to reducing global warming from nitrogen input. Thus, we synthesized 72 published studies (2144 paired observations) of greenhouse gas fluxes and soil labile compounds of carbon and nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen and carbon), to understand the effects of labile carbon and nitrogen on greenhouse gas emissions under global nitrogen input. Across the data set, nitrogen input significantly promoted carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from wetlands. In particular, at lower nitrogen rates (<100 kg ha(-1).yr(-1)) and with added ammonium compounds, freshwater wetland significantly promoted carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Peatland was the largest nitrous oxide source under these conditions. This meta-analysis also revealed that nitrogen input stimulated dissolved organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen accumulation in the wetland ecosystem. The variation-partitioning analysis and structural equation model were used to analyze the relationship between the greenhouse gas and labile carbon and nitrogen further. These results revealed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the primary factor driving greenhouse gas emission from wetlands under global nitrogen input, whereas microbial biomass carbon (MBC) more directly affects greenhouse gas emission than other labile carbon and nitrogen.

AB Analyses of sedimentary diatoms in two New England ponds reveal limnological changes during the past 2500 years that are related to climatic change, anthropogenic activities and natural disturbance. Deforestation in the lake catchments during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries temporarily affected diatom assemblages, with subsequent recovery. However, algal communities did not return completely to presettlement conditions as a result of long-term trends in climatic change, small-scale natural disturbances and delayed watershed recovery from acidification. A short- term rise in diatominferred dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Levi Pond was related to partial removal of vegetation by logging in the catchment, and a similar DOC increase at North Round Pond is correlated with a hurricane and increased aquatic productivity. At Levi Pond, increasing diatom- inferred DOC concentrations during the past c. 2000 years likely reflect a long- term increase in allochthonous organic matter and peat development in the watershed related to moister conditions, supported by corresponding patterns in the stable- isotope, chironomid and pollen records. These results correspond with moisture patterns in adjacent areas inferred from pollen and sediment analyses, suggesting that diatoms in Levi Pond recorded a larger regional trend in increasing moisture. This is the first study in a temperate region that links diatom- inferred DOC concentration to past changes in moisture balance, suggesting that fossil diatoms may be a promising proxy for future palaeohydrological studies in temperate regions. However, more studies are necessary to separate the effects of peatland growth and allochthonous organic- matter input on lake- DOC concentrations.

AB The carbon (C) balance of boreal peatlands is mainly the sum of three different C fluxes: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). lntra- and inter-annual dynamics of these fluxes are differentially controlled by similar factors, such as temperature and water-table. Different climatic conditions within and between years might thus result in varying absolute and relative contributions of each flux to net ecosystem productivity (NEP). In this study CO2 fluxes were measured at a boreal peatland in eastern Finland during a dry year (2006) and a wet year (2007) and combined with DOC and CH4 fluxes from the same site. CO2 uptake in the wet year was 65% higher than in the dry year, caused by higher water table (WT) and subsequently reduced rates of soil respiration. Two to three-fold increases in DOC and CH4 fluxes in the wet year did not completely offset the higher CO2 uptake in that year, resulting in NEP of -83.7 +/- 14 g C M-2 in the dry and 134.5 +/- 21 g C 111(-2) in the wet year. Thus, in our study, WT was identified as the most important factor responsible for variations in the C balance between the observed years. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands cover over 400 million hectares of the Earth's surface and store between one-third and one-half of the world's soil carbon pool. The long-term ability of peatlands to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere means that they play a major role in moderating global climate. Peatlands can also either attenuate or accentuate flooding. Changing climate or management can alter peatland hydrological processes and pathways for water movement across and below the peat surface. It is the movement of water in peats that drives carbon storage and flux. These small-scale processes can have global impacts through exacerbated terrestrial carbon release. This paper will describe advances in understanding environmental processes operating in peatlands. Recent (and future) advances in high-resolution topographic data collection and hydrological modelling provide an insight into the spatial impacts of land management and climate change in peatlands. Nevertheless, there are still some major challenges for future research. These include the problem that impacts of disturbance in peat can be irreversible, at least on human time-scales. This has implications for the perceived success and understanding of peatland restoration strategies. In some circumstances, peatland restoration may lead to exacerbated carbon loss. This will also be important if we decide to start to create peatlands in order to counter the threat from enhanced atmospheric carbon.

AB Wetlands are prevalent in the Sudbury, Ontario region and often operate at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, modifying water chemistry and potentially affecting the recovery of impacted lakes. The deposition of metals and sulphur in Sudbury in 2010-2012 was far below that reported in the 1970's, but still higher than background values. Wetlands in the area have accumulated large quantities of metals, and high concentrations of these metals in streams occurred primarily in response to SO4-related acidification events or associated with high dissolved organic carbon production in early summer. Concentrations of most metals in streams exceeded provincial guidelines and fluxes of some metals from catchments exceeded deposition inputs to lakes by as much as 12 times. The release of metals long after emissions reductions have been achieved must be considered in ecosystem recovery studies, particularly as dry conditions may become more prevalent in boreal regions affected by mining.

AB Despite the importance of understanding controls on microbial carbon (C) mineralization in peat soils, the role of vascular plant root exudates is still unclear. To determine whether root exudates could stimulate enhanced decomposition of peat, we utilized an in-vitro method involving the addition of a solution similar to root exudates (6 glucose-C: 2 citrate-C: 2 amino acid-C, at 3 addition levels) to peat, incubating the mixture and measuring CO2 produced over 20 d and microbial biomass and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at the end of the incubation. We defined priming as inorganic C (IC) production (CO2 + calculated dissolved inorganic C) during the incubation being greater than that attributed to the control peat plus the added C. An addition level of 0.083 mg C g(-1) dry peat, estimated to represent root exudation over one 12-h sunny day in a bog, caused an enhancement in IC production that exceeded that produced in the controls and the amount of added C after 8 d, with rates levelling to control values after 15 d. At the end of the incubation nearly 3 times the amount added C had been mineralized, relative to the control, however this represented only 4% of total microbial respiration in the controls. Although the priming effect pattern appeared to be real throughout repeated measurements in our experiments, the statistical probabilities were not always large due to high variability in background CO2 production levels. Given the observed long lag-times and overall small magnitude and large variability in observed effects, we conclude that although priming of decomposition appears to occur in peatlands, it likely has only a minor overall impact on net C loss to the atmosphere.

AB Extensive new data from previously unstudied Siberian streams and rivers suggest that mobilization of currently frozen, high-latitude soil carbon is likely over the next century in response to predicted Arctic warming. We present dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements from ninety-six watersheds in West Siberia, a region that contains the world's largest stores of peat carbon, exports massive volumes of freshwater and DOC to the Arctic Ocean, and is warming faster than the Arctic as a whole. The sample sites span &SIM; 10(6) km(2) over a large climatic gradient ( &SIM; 55 - 68 &DEG; N), providing data on a much broader spatial scale than previous studies and for the first time explicitly examining stream DOC in permafrost peatland environments. Our results show that cold, permafrost-influenced watersheds release little DOC to streams, regardless of the extent of peatland cover. However, we find considerably higher concentrations in warm, permafrost-free watersheds, rising sharply as a function of peatland cover. The two regimes are demarcated by the position of the -2&DEG; C mean annual air temperature (MAAT) isotherm, which is also approximately coincident with the permafrost limit. Climate model simulations for the next century predict near-doubling of West Siberian land surface areas with a MAAT warmer than -2&DEG; C, suggesting up to &SIM; 700% increases in stream DOC concentrations and &SIM; 2.7 - 4.3 Tg yr(-1) (&SIM; 29 - 46%) increases in DOC flux to the Arctic Ocean.

AB Two long records of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in river water were examined by a detailed time series analysis in order to shed light on the mechanisms generating observed increases in DOC concentrations across the UK. The records date back as far as 1962 and come from catchments 589 and 818 km(2) in area. The DOC records were compared with others taken simultaneously for flow, pH, alkalinity, air temperature and rainfall, and in one of the catchments also for turbidity and conductivity. All records were examined by the seasonal Kendall test; frequency distributions of daily DOC measurements were examined; annual cycles were calculated, Autoregressive and impulse functions were derived for DOC against flow records. The time series analysis shows that: (i) DOC trends cannot be readily explained by trends in flow, pH, alkalinity, turbidity or conductivity; (ii) there is a significant increase in carbon flux from these catchments; (iii) maximum and minimum components of the annual distribution of daily readings both show increases in DOC, implying that DOC flux is increasing for differing hydrological pathways; (iv) increases in DOC concentrations coincide with increases in temperature, though the biggest increases in temperature are in the winter months when such increases might be expected to have less effect on DOC production; (v) change in trend, and therefore flux, was observed to occur after a severe drought in 1976. The study suggests that there are real, significant increases in carbon loss from upland peat catchments and that climate is a major driver, especially a severe drought. Severe drought triggering changes in the DOC flux might be attributed to enzymic latch mechanisms. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2)-fixing trees have been expanding to boreal peatlands, yet its influence on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) biodegradation is unclear. Here, we measured DOC, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) concentrations, specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), and humification index in the extracts obtained from peats in the 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-40 cm depths in the open peatlands and Alnus sibirica islands in a boreal peatland, Northeast China. Afterwards, the peat extracts were used to assess the effect of N-2-fixing woody plant expansion on DOC biodegradation with a 42-day incubation experiment. The expansion of A. sibirica significantly increased NH4+-N, NO3-N, DIN, and DTN concentrations, but did not produce a significant effect on SUVA(254) and humification index in the extracts in each depth. Following A. sibirica expansion, DOC biodegradation was enhanced by 24.5%, 15.4%, and 38.3% at 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-40 cm depths, respectively. Furthermore, DOC biodegradation was significantly and negatively correlated with DOC:DIN and DOC:DTN ratios, but exhibited no significant relationship with SUVA(254) and humification index. This implied that improved N availability and associated shifts in C:N stoichiometry determined the increase in DOC biodegradation following A. sibirica expansion. Our findings suggest that N-2-fixing tree encroachment promotes microbial decomposition of DOC through improved N availability in boreal peatlands, which may cause organic C loss from soils in these C-enriched ecosystems.

AB Peatlands are known as N2O sinks or low N2O sources due to nitrogen (N) limitation. However, climate warming and N deposition can modulate this limitation, and little is known about the combinative effects of them on N2O emission from boreal peatlands. In this study, experimental warming and N fertilization treatments were conducted at a boreal peatland in western Newfoundland, Canada. Contrary to previous studies on permafrost peatland and alpine meadows, the effect of warming treatment on N2O flux was not detectable during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. The N fertilization treatment significantly increased the N2O flux by 1.61 nmol m(-2) S-1 due to increased N availability. Noticeably, warming reduced the effect of N fertilization treatment on N2O flux with high significance in the middle growing season of 2015. This can be attributed to low N availability caused by stimulated vegetation growth in the warming treatment. In addition, the results showed that total nitrogen was the main control on N2O emission under N fertilization, while dissolved organic carbon was the main driver under the combined treatment of warming and N fertilization.

AB The West Siberian Plain stands out among other boreal plains by phenomenal bogging, which has both global and regional significance. The polygonal bogs, frozen raised-mound bogs, and ombrotrophic ridge-hollow raised bogs are the most extensive bog types in the study area. These bogs commonly show highly diverse surface patterns consisting of mounds, polygons, ridges, hollows, and fens that correspond to the microtopes. Here we investigated how the microtopographic features of the landscape affect the thermal and hydrologic conditions of the soil as well as the nutrient availability and consequently, the dynamics of carbon and related elements. The effect of the surface heterogeneity on the temperature regimes and depths of permafrost is most significant. All of these factors together are reflected, through the feedback system, by a number of hydrochemical parameters of bog waters, such as dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC, DIC), specific conductivity (Cond), SO42-, Cl-, P, Sr, Al, Ti, Cu, V, B, Cs, Cd, Rb, As, U, and rare earth elements (REEs). Among the studied parameters, DOC, SO42-, Al, V, and Mn differ most significantly between the convex and concave microforms. The DOC content in bog water is significantly affected by the water residence time, which is significantly longer in soils of mound/polygons than fens. Plants biomass is higher on the mounds which also have some effect that, due to leaching, should lead to more carbon entering into the water of the mounds. It is also shown that atmospheric-dust particles have a noticeable effect on the hydrochemical parameters of bog waters, especially on mounds. The ongoing climate warming will lead to an increase in the fens area and to a decrease in the content of DOC and many elements in bog waters.

AB The peatland carbon store is threatened by climate change and is expected to provide positive feedback on air temperature. Most studies indicate that enhanced temperature and microbial activities result in a rise of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a consequence of higher peat decomposition. Few of them, however, have investigated the impact of in situ experimental warming on DOC response.
   We studied the response of DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), phenol oxidase, and fluorescein diacetate activities (FDA) to a 3-year in situ experimental warming using open-top chambers (OTCs) in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland.
   No significant warming of soil was recorded, implying that the simultaneous decrease in DOC and DON and the rise in FDA at the depths of 25 and 40 cm were not caused by the direct effect of OTCs on water temperature, but might instead have been mediated by plant root exudates. The water chemistry suggests that DOC production was compensated by in situ mineralization. We hypothesize that an increased hydrolysis of organic matter (OM) was counterbalanced by the mineralization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and that microorganisms preferentially used labile compounds originating from increased root exudates.
   This trade-off between production of DOC through hydrolysis and consumption in the process of mineralization shows (1) the limitation of using only DOC as an indicator of the sensitivity of peat decomposition to climate warming and (2) the need to improve our understanding of the indirect impact of root exudates.

AB Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil and stream waters in upland catchments are widely monitored, in part due to the potential of DOC to form harmful by-products when chlorinated during treatment of water for public supply. DOC can be measured directly, though this is expensive and time-consuming. Light absorbance in the UV-vis spectrum is often used as a surrogate measurement from which a colour-carbon relationship between absorbance and DOC can be derived, but this relationship can be confounded by numerous variables. Through the analysis of data from eight sites in England and Wales we investigate the possibility of using the concentration of phenolic compounds in water samples as a proxy for DOC concentration. A general model using data from all the sites allowed DOC to be calculated from phenolics at an accuracy of 81-86%. A detailed analysis at one site revealed that a site-specific calibration was more accurate than the general model, and that this compared favourably with a colour-carbon calibration. We therefore recommend this method for use where estimates of DOC concentration are needed, but where time and money are limiting factors, or as an additional method to calculate DOC alongside colour-carbon calibrations. Tests demonstrated only small amounts of phenolic degradation over time; a loss of 0.92 mg L-1 after 8 months in storage, and so this method can be used on older samples with limited loss of accuracy.

AB We report the irradiation of titanium dioxide suspensions (Hombikat UV100 and P25) under different conditions regarding the source of dissolved organic carbon (2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and brown water from a bog lake), and with and without added copper(II) ions. In contrast to P25 suspensions, we found no significant bromoform formation in Hombikat UV100 suspensions, likely because bromoform is degraded faster with Hombikat UV100 than with P25, preventing accumulation. In the case of P25 suspensions, the presence of 10 mu M of added Cu(2+) significantly inhibited bromoform formation. Bromoform was the only measurable trihalomethane (THM), even in the presence of 250 mg L(-1) chloride ions. The concentrations of formed THM were below the limits for drinking water under all investigated experimental conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Re-naturalisation was investigated in 2012 on a peat bog (Pachiterric Histosol) with a non-removed peat layer at the former Radviliskis Experimental Station of the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture in the site of the long-term field experiment, which had been completed 12 years ago. Peat samples were taken from 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers in 3 field replicates. Chemical analyses were carried out at the Chemical Research Laboratory of Institute of Agriculture, LRCAF. The previously differently used peat soil contained different stocks of organic carbon (SOC). SOC stocks in the soil occupied with grassland were greater than those in peat soil previously not used for agriculture. The largest stock of MHA was in former unfertilised perennial grasses (0-30 cm)- 78.67% compared with other treatments. MHA content increased with increasing depth. The lower stability of carbon compounds in 0-30 cm layer was determined in the peat previously un-used for agricultural purposes, which had the highest relative share (40.9%) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), characterized by the highest lability. We concluded that the most efficient way to conserve and sustain organic carbon in peat is to grow perennial grasses under non-intensive management system.

AB Peatland degradation is expected to increase the rate of aerobic decomposition in surface soil (0-30 cm). Carbon stored in both the subsurface (30-60 cm) and deeper layers ( > 60 cm) of peatlands is also expected to be metabolized after degradation. However, little is known about how methane were emissions from subsurface and the deeper layers of peatlands during degradation. Three peatland degradation stages: S1, intact fen with high water table; S2, lightly degraded fen with a fluctuating water table; S3, heavily degraded fen with a lower water table were chosen to quantify the differences in CH4 emissions at different peatland degradation stages. CH4 emissions and methanogens of subsurface and deep soil were also measured to reveal the contribution rates of subsurface methane emission in this study. After four-years experiment, we found that the abundance of methanogens and methane emissions decreased as peatlands were more heavily degraded. We also found that the contribution rate of methane emission decreased from peat surface to subsurface and deep layer, and this trend varied with peatland degradation. A higher contribution rate was found in the subsurface methane emissions from S1 (32.63%) and S2 (19.94%). Importantly, when peatlands were heavily degraded, the subsurface changed from a CH4 source to a sink. Decreased methane emissions of the degraded peatlands was also associated with a high abundance of methanogens (R-2 = 0.75, p < 0.05). Thus, we conclude that peatland degradation reduces methanogens and methane emissions from both surface and deep soils. Peatland degradation induced aerobic condition and substrate limitation are the main reasons for the reduced methane emission from Zoige peatland.

AB Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the water column and their exchange at the water/air interface were studied during the open water period in two freshwater ponds with different catchment characteristics in the northern boreal zone in Finland; either peatlands or coniferous upland forests dominated the catchment of the ponds. Both ponds were supersaturated with dissolved CO2 and CH4 with respect to the equilibrium with the atmosphere, but were close to the equilibrium with N2O. The mean CO2 efflux from the pond was higher in the peatland-dominated catchment (22 mg m(-)2 h(-1)) than in the forested catchment (0.7 mg m(-2) h(-1)), whereas the mean CH4 emissions were similar (7.6 and 3.5 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively). The fluxes of N2O were generally negligible. The higher CO2 concentrations and efflux in the pond with the peatland-dominated catchment were attributed to a greater input of allochthonous carbon to that pond from its catchment due to its higher water colour and higher total organic carbon (TOC) concentration. The water pH, which also differed between the ponds, could additionally affect the CO2 dynamics. Since the catchment characteristics can regulate aquatic carbon cycles, catchment-scale studies are needed to attain a deeper understanding of the aquatic greenhouse gas dynamics.

AB Although the majority of coastal sediments consist of sandy material, in some areas marine ingression caused the submergence of terrestrial carbon-rich peat soils. This affects the coastal carbon balance, as peat represents a potential carbon source. We performed a column experiment to better understand the coupled flow and biogeochemical processes governing carbon transformations in submerged peat under coastal fresh groundwater (GW) discharge and brackish water intrusion. The columns contained naturally layered sediments with and without peat (organic carbon content in peat 39 +/- 14 wt%), alternately supplied with oxygen-rich brackish water from above and oxygen-poor, low-saline GW from below. The low-saline GW discharge through the peat significantly increased the release and ascent of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the peat (delta C-13(DOC) - 26.9 parts per thousand to - 27.7 parts per thousand), which was accompanied by the production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), implying DOC mineralization. Oxygen respiration, sulfate (SO42-) reduction, and methane (CH4) formation were differently pronounced in the sediments and were accompanied with higher microbial abundances in peat compared to sand with SO42--reducing bacteria clearly dominating methanogens. With decreasing salinity and SO42- concentrations, CH4 emission rates increased from 16.5 to 77.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) during a 14-day, low-saline GW discharge phase. In contrast, oxygenated brackish water intrusion resulted in lower DOC and DIC pore water concentrations and significantly lower CH4 and CO2 emissions. Our study illustrates the strong dependence of carbon cycling in shallow coastal areas with submerged peat deposits on the flow and mixing dynamics within the subterranean estuary.

AB Softwater lakes provide a habitat for isoetid macrophytes, which are vulnerable to eutrophication and acidification. In Ireland many catchments of such lakes are currently planted with exotic conifers. Management of these plantations can lead to increases in lake water phosphorus (P), threatening the survival of softwater macrophytes. Regional increases of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may also have a detrimental effect on aquatic plants. The persistence of the macrophyte flora in lakes with managed forested catchments in Northern Ireland was investigated by comparing the macrophyte community of 12 lakes surveyed in 2007 with a 1988-1990 survey. Contemporary data were compared with plant macrofossil records pre-dating 1900. Macrophyte abundance generally remained unchanged but Littorella uniflora (L) Asch. and Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw. showed a significant decline since 1988-1990. Water colour, alkalinity, silica, total P. total soluble P and soluble reactive P increased; conductivity and chlorophyll a decreased in the lakes over time. These changes coincided with increased pH in precipitation and potentially elevated exports of DOC to water. Conifer plantation management appeared to have less impact on the macrophyte flora than expected from the elevated lake P concentrations. It appears that a large regional increase in DOC is also a threat to macrophyte abundance and diversity in these upland catchments and conservation efforts may be more successful in lakes with longer water residence times.

AB High-latitude boreal and arctic surface/inland waters contain sizeable reservoirs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and trace elements (TE), which are subject to seasonal freezing. Specifically, shallow ponds and lakes in the permafrost zone often freeze solid, which can lead to transformations in the colloidal and dissolved fractions of DOM and TE. Here, we present results from experimental freeze-thaw cycles using iron (Fe)- and DOM-rich water from thaw ponds situated in Stordalen and Storflaket palsa mires in northern Sweden. After ten cycles of freezing, 85% of Fe and 25% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were removed from solution in circumneutral fen water (pH 6.9) but a much smaller removal of Fe and DOC (< 7%) was found in acidic bog water (pH 3.6). This removal pattern was consistent with initial supersaturation of fen water with respect to Fe hydroxide and a lack of supersaturation with any secondary mineral phase in the bog water. There was a nearly two- to threefold increase in the low-molecular-weight (LMW) fraction of organic carbon (OC) and several TEs caused by the repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Future increases in the freeze-thaw frequency of surface waters with climate warming may remove up to 25% of DOC in circumneutral organic-rich waters. Furthermore, an increase of LMW OC may result in enhanced carbon dioxide losses from aquatic ecosystems since this fraction is potentially more susceptible to biodegradation.

AB The role of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in mineral weathering was investigated in laboratory experiments analyzing supernatant composition using treatments of DOC from peat or leaf leachates on clinochlore, microcline, and an iron-rich sediment. Weathering intensity, expressed as the sum of molar concentrations of major elements measured over a 400-h period, fell in the sequence Fe-sediment > clinochlore > microcline. The leaf leachates containing 50 and 300 mg DOC L-1 were stronger weathering agents than either the 50 mg DOC L-1 peat extract, water, or dilute HCI. Anaerobic conditions in the peat extract did not enhance weathering and, in some cases, appeared to retard weathering rates. Fe in the supernatant was primarily < 0.1 mum, and a large proportion of the total Fe concentration was unable to react with o-phenanthroline, suggesting either Fe3+  or Fe2+ bound tightly to organic or inorganic particles. Using the SOILCHEM thermodynamic speciation model, it was determined that the magnitude of weathering enhancement of cations in the supernatant of DOC-rich treatments could not be attributed to direct metal-DOC binding. The cations are likely held by a peptization mechanism, forming inorganic/organic colloids <0.1 mum.

AB Boreal wetland carbon cycling is vulnerable to climate change in part because hydrology and the extent of frozen ground have strong influences on plant and microbial functions. We examined the response of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) across an experimental manipulation of water table position (both raised and lowered water table treatments) in a boreal-rich fen in interior Alaska. DOC and TDN responses to water table manipulation exhibited an interaction with seasonal ice dynamics. We observed consistently higher DOC and TDN concentrations in the lowered water table treatment (71.7 +/- 6.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.3 mg(-L)) than in both the control (55.6 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 mg(-L)) and raised (49.1 +/- 4.3 and 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg L-1, respectively) water table treatments. Across all plots, pore water DOC concentrations at 20 cm increased as the depth to water table increased (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.001). DOC concentrations also increased as the seasonal thaw depth increased, with solutes increasing most rapidly in the drained plot (R-2 = 0.62, p < 0.001). About half of the TDN pool was composed of dissolved organic N (DON). Inorganic N and DON were both highly correlated with changes in DOC, and their respective constraints to mineralization are discussed. These results demonstrate that a declining water table position and dryer conditions affect thaw depth and peat temperatures, and interactions among these ecosystem properties will likely increase DOC and TDN loading and potential for export in these systems.

AB Peatlands are large sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to downstream ecosystems and DOC losses account for an important portion of peatland carbon balance. Disturbance and restoration of peatland ecosystems alters ecohydrological conditions that are likely to affect DOC chemistry in both soil water and discharge, although the direction of change and controls on DOC chemistry post-restoration remain unclear. We investigated DOC chemistry (concentration, SUVA(254), E2:E3, E4:E6, pentose and hexose concentration) during the growing season (May to October) in soil and discharge of a peatland restored for 10 years and compared the results to those measured at neighboring unrestored and natural peatland sites. Controls on the spatial and temporal variability of DOC chemistry, including pH, water table, temperature, plant cover and type, and carbon dioxide and methane flux were also investigated. After 10 years, restoration increased DOC concentration in soils compared to both natural and unrestored sites. This high DOC concentration likely resulted from high plant productivity post-restoration and a mean water table position deeper than the natural site. Ecohydrological conditions were also correlated to DOC chemistry. High vascular plant cover and photosynthesis rates were correlated to lower SUVA(254) and higher pentose concentration, while deeper water table position was correlated to higher E2:E3 and E4:E6. DOC concentration in discharge was lower, and E2:E3 higher, at the restored compared to the unrestored site. Differences in DOC chemistry in discharge water were minimal between the sites except when water was likely sourced from the near surface layer at the restored site, which represents new peat accumulated post-restoration. These results suggest that DOC dynamics 10 years post-restoration remain intermediate between natural and unrestored peatland. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Methylmercury (MeHg) is a neurotoxin and endocrine disruptor that bioaccumulates and biomagnifies through trophic levels, resulting in potentially hazardous concentrations. Although wetlands are known hotspots for mercury (Hg) methylation, the effects of avian biovectors on these processes are poorly understood. We examined Hg speciation and distribution in shallow groundwater and surface water from a raised-bog with over 30 years of avian biovector (herring gulls Larus argentatus and great black-backed gulls Larus marinus) colonization and guano input. Compared to the reference site, the avian-impacted bog had elevated concentrations of total dissolved organic carbon (TOC), total Hg, MeHg, phosphate (PO43-), and other trace metals, notably Pb, As, Cd and Ni. Spatial interpolation showed that the densest area of gull nesting was co-located with areas that had the highest concentrations of PO43-, MeHg, As and Cd, but not total mercury (THg), and models suggested that Mn, PO43-, and dissolved TOC were strong predictors of MeHg. Our findings suggest that while these gulls may not be a significant source of Hg, the excess of PO43- (a well recognised component of guano) and the subsequent changes in water chemistry due to avian biovector subsidies may increase net Hg methylation.

AB A series of experiments were conducted to address the fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the peat - stream interface zone linking a minerotrophic poor fen and an ombrotrophic mire with surrounding stream water in the drainage area of Lake Ortrasket in northern Sweden. Transport and mineralisation of DOC were quantified in peat - stream interface cores in response to variations in pore water velocity, DOC concentration and the molecular size and source of DOC. Mineralisation and CH4 production were positively correlated with pore water velocity at rates between 0.08 and 0.20 cm h(-1) and negatively correlated at rates between 0.20 and 0.40 cm h(-1). The DOC concentration of the effluent from the peat cores was independent of the pore water velocity but proportional to the DOC concentration of the source water. Higher concentrations of DOC were exported from than imported to the peat cores, and the cores exported DOC molecules of smaller average molecular size than received. Carbon mineralisation in the peat, assessed in a static system, was independent of the concentration of DOC. DOC with a nominal cutoff at 100 Da was mineralised faster by streamwater bacteria than DOC dialysed with a cutoff at 3500 Da, and their mineralisation rate was positively correlated with the DOC concentration. Streamwater bacteria mineralised streamwater DOC at a lower rate than the peat - stream interface zone pore water DOC. The pattern of velocity dependence of mineralisation was the same for both sources of peat DOC but the mineralisation rates, average molecular size, and bioavailability of DOC were different, emphasising the importance of the compositional heterogeneity of the peat - stream interface zone for the DOC budget of streamwater.

AB Hydrological changes have the greatest impact on shallow lakes where they alter the water volume and lake depth noticeably. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is markedly affected by hydrological factors, has an important role in many biogeochemical processes. The DOC load supplied to Lake Vortsjarv, the second largest lake in Estonia, was studied on the scale of the subcatchments discharging into the lake. Daily discharges and biweekly or monthly DOC concentrations were measured close to the river outlets over the years 1990-2002. The stream flow data were separated into groundflow and surface flow by applying local minimum and recursive digital filtering methods. Constituent load estimation software, LOADEST, was used to estimate DOC concentrations and load. LOADEST performed well for three of the four rivers. The total estimated DOC load to Vortsjarv from all four main rivers varied from 1,320 to 4,934 t year(-1). The average annual load over the 13-year period was 3,265 t year(-1) or 1.18 g C m(-2) year(-1). Baseflow separation analysis indicated that the DOC load originating from groundflow contributed 79% and 69% of the total load according to the digital filter and local minimum methods, respectively. The results of our study demonstrate the utility of linking the rating-curve method and baseflow separation to assess the allochthonous DOC load to Vortsjarv both currently and under changing climatic conditions.

AB Sub-daily variations in the rates and dominance of the main controls of stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (production, mobility and instream processes) have the potential to create a subtle sub-daily rhythm of DOC variation in streams. We used high-frequency data, covering the spring-summer-autumn period, which included discharge, specific conductivity, pH, groundwater levels, temperature, evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving diel DOC cycles in northern catchments. We focused on a peatland dominated 1st order stream (0.65 km(2)) before investigating the propagation of the signals downstream to a 2nd order stream (3.2 km(2)), with a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel. DOC cycles in the 1st order stream had a median peak time of 14:00 h and temporally varying amplitude, with a median of 0.61 mgl(-1). Results supported the hypothesis that diel DOC cycles at the site are driven by hydrological processes, specifically the viscosity-effect theory: viscosity-driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon flush DOC from the peat to the stream. The temporal variability in the amplitude of the diel DOC cycle was controlled by antecedent temperature. Downstream, the did DOC signal was weaker, with around 4-fold lower amplitudes and minima in the afternoon. The lower proportion of riparian peat downstream appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes on DOC cycles. In-stream photodegradation and decomposition likely became more dominant as connectivity between DOC sources and stream reduced. The study highlighted that even in climates such as the Scottish Highlands, where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent, sub-daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur. Unravelling the intricacy of such diel cycles is fundamental to fully understanding stream functioning and the global carbon cycle.

AB Herein we report on the photocatalytic degradation of natural organic matter from a bog lake (Lake Hohloh, Black Forest, Germany) as followed by size exclusion chromatography with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ultraviolet (lambda = 254 nm) detection (SEC-DOC and SEC-UV). When irradiating this humic-rich water in the presence of 0.5 g L-1 titanium dioxide (P25),we found a preferential degradation of the higher molecular weight DOC fraction. This was coupled to growth of the middle and small DOC fractions. Mineralization proceeded in two distinct steps: a first stage without noticeable mineralization, followed by a phase of steady decrease in dissolved organic carbon. Formic, oxalic, succinic and glutaric acids were found in the irradiated samples and contribute significantly to the bioavailable DOC after irradiation, which favors bacterial regrowth.

AB Rates of anaerobic respiration are of central importance for the long-term burial of carbon (C) in peatlands, which are a relevant sink in the global C cycle. To identify constraints on anaerobic peat decomposition, we determined detailed concentration depth profiles of decomposition end-products, i.e. methane (CH4) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), along with concentrations of relevant decomposition intermediates at an ombrotrophic Canadian peat bog. The magnitude of in situ net production rates of DIC and CH4 was estimated by inverse pore-water modeling. Vertical transport in the peat was slow and dominated by diffusion leading to the buildup of DIC and CH4 with depth (5500 mu mol L-1 DIC, 500 mu mol L-1 CH4). Highest DIC and CH4 production rates occurred close to the water table (decomposition constant k(d) similar to 10(-3)-10(-4) a(-1)) or in some distinct zones at depth (k(d) similar to 10(-4) a(-1)). Deeper into the peat, decomposition proceeded very slowly at about k(d) = 10(-7) a(-1). This pattern could be related to thermodynamic and transport constraints. The accumulation of metabolic end-products diminished in situ energy yields of acetoclastic methanogenesis to the threshold for microbially mediated processes (-20 to -25 kJ mol(-1) CH4). The methanogenic precursor acetate also accumulated (150 mu mol L-1). In line with these findings, CH4 was formed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at Gibbs free energies of -35 to -40 kJ mol(-1) CH4. This was indicated by an isotopic fractionation alpha(CO2-CH4) of 1.069-1.079. Fermentative degradation of acetate, propionate and butyrate attained Gibbs free energies close to 0 kJ mol-1 substrate. Although methanogenesis was apparently limited by some other factor in some peat layers, transport and thermodynamic constraints likely impeded respiratory processes in the deeper peat. Constraints on the removal of DIC and CH4 may thus slow decomposition and contribute to the sustained burial of C in northern peatlands. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Boreal fens are minerotrophic peatlands that act as important control points for dissolved C between upland and aquatic ecosystems. Fens occupy a minerotrophic continuum from "rich," having high water tables and large nutrient contributions from upland sources, to "poor" having low water tables and small nutrient contributions. Dissolved C within these fens will be influenced by the degree of minerotrophy, which in turn impacts peat pore water acidity and alkalinity and downstream productivity. To examine how dissolved C concentrations change along the minerotrophic gradient and to explore possible mechanisms controlling their concentration, pore water chemistry was analyzed from piezometers at 25-, 50-, and 100-cm depths in rich, intermediate, and poor fens during the snow-free periods of 2005, 2006 (dissolved organic C [DOC] only), 2007, and 2008. We found that dissolved inorganic C (DIC) concentrations increased with higher water tables (poor < intermediate < rich) and wetter years (2005 < 2007 ", 2008). In contrast, DOC concentrations decreased with higher water tables (rich < intermediate < poor), but the effect differed among years. Wetter conditions resulted in high DOC concentrations in the intermediate fen, low concentration in the poor fen, and no change in the rich fen. Correlation analyses suggest that DIC concentrations may be linked to groundwater contribution of carbonate materials and DOC to ionic strength and mechanisms of productivity and decomposition. Although further experimentation is required to verify these mechanisms, the evidence points to the importance of minerotrophic status when considering the role of peatlands in watershed C balances and their response to changing climate.

AB Approximately one-third of northern peatlands are within permafrost regions. Soil organic matter (SOM) and plant root biomass in permafrost peatlands are vulnerable to future global warming. However, previous studies have primarily focused on the response of SOM mineralization to increases in temperature without analysing the potential interaction effects of increased plant root biomass. This study investigated the influence of temperature and root additions on soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization as well as the mechanisms driving mineralization in a high latitude permafrost peatland in the Da Xing'an Mountains, Northeast China. We investigated changes in shallow soil (0-15 cm) and deep soil (15-30 cm) carbon mineralization, available N contents, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and enzyme activities in response to increasing temperature and Eriophorum vaginatum root additions by using an incubation experiment. Our results indicate that elevated temperature significantly increased soil carbon mineralization. The Q(10) values of the carbon mineralization rates in the shallow soil and deep soil were 3.95 and 2.91, respectively. In contrast, the soil MBC and DOC decreased significantly, confirming that labile carbon is the main driving force of microbial mineralization activities under warming conditions. Elevated temperature significantly increased the shallow soil net N mineralization rates and increased the net nitrification rates in both soil layers. At high temperatures, ammonification rates increased in the shallow soil but decreased in the deep soil. The increase in the incubation temperature resulted in significantly increased shallow soil beta-glucosidase activity and decreased invertase activity. This suggests the increased production of complex substrate enzymes, and decreased production of simple substrate-acquiring enzymes. The root additions significantly increased the soil C mineralization and stimulated the secretion of invertase by soil microorganisms. These findings indicate that future climate warming in the northern high latitude will significantly stimulate soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization in permafrost peatlands. Furthermore, increases in plant roots will enhance C accumulation and may even enhance the response of soil C mineralization to temperature, significantly impact the soil C balance in high latitude permafrost peatlands.

   We studied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from drainage ditches and leaching losses in a boreal cutaway peatland cultivated with reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) for bioenergy. The objectives of the study were to assess to what extent GHG emissions from drainage ditches and leaching of carbon and nutrients via surface drainage contribute to the total losses of carbon and nitrogen from the site. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 were measured with static chamber methods for three years and leaching losses for seven years. On average, the drainage ditches (covering 6% of the study site area) released 10% of the total CH4 emission (0.33 g m(-2) a(-1)), and 1% and 5% of the total N2O and CO2 emissions, respectively. Leaching of total nitrogen and phosphorous were 0.31 and 0.03 g m(-2) a(-1), respectively. Leaching values were lower than those reported for agricultural catchments in general.

AB Lake Grosse Fuchskuhle (Brandenburg, Germany) is a naturally acidic bog lake that was artificially divided into four basins by large plastic curtains for biomanipulation experiments in 1990. Different numbers of perch were added to each compartment beginning in the spring of 1993. The species composition and abundance of phytoplankton, pH, nutrient concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll a content were analyzed at regular intervals during 1991 and 1998. The division of the lake resulted in divergent developments in the physical and chemical environment of the compartments. This study compared the phytoplankton assemblages of the Northeast- (NE) and Southwest- (SW) basins which differed strongly in chemistry during the investigation period. Divergent developments in phytoplankton species composition in both basins can be explained by changes in physical and chemical conditions (bottom-up effects). Increased pH values and DOC concentrations probably favoured mass developments of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium uberrimum since 1993, while increased nutrients (dissolved inorganic carbon, total nitrogen and especially total phosphorus) as well as further changes in pH and DOC led to the dominance of the raphidophyte Gonyostomum semen in 1998. This bloom was characterized by extreme biomasses of up to 143 mg l(-1) wet weight, corresponding with high chlorophyll a concentrations of up to 413 mug l(-1) at the same time. In contrast, no significant relationship between experimental manipulations by piscivorous fish stocking (top-down effects) and phytoplankton biomass were observed.

AB Paramo soils store high amounts of organic carbon. However, the effects of climate change and changes in land cover and use (LC/LU) in this high-elevation tropical ecosystem may cause a decrease in their carbon storage capacity. Therefore, better understanding of the factors influencing the Paramo soils' carbon storage and export is urgently needed. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the differences in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in the soil water of four LC/LU types (tussock grass, natural forest, pine plantations, and pasture) and the factors controlling its variability in the Quinuas Ecohydrological Observatory in south Ecuador. Weekly measurements of soil water DOC concentrations, meteorological variables, soil water content, and temperature from various depths and slope positions were monitored within the soils' organic and mineral horizons between October 2014 and January 2017. These data were used to generate regression trees and random forest statistical models to identify the factors controlling soil water DOC concentrations. From high to low concentrations, natural forest depict the highest DOC concentrations followed by pasture, tussock grass, and pine forest. For all LC/LU types, DOC concentrations increase with decreasing soil moisture. Our results also show that LC/LU is the most important predictor of soil water DOC concentrations, followed by sampling depth and soil moisture. Interestingly, atmospheric variables and antecedent evapotranspiration and precipitation conditions show only little influence on DOC concentrations during the monitoring period. Our findings provide unique information that can help improve the management of soil and water resources in the Paramo and other peat dominated ecosystems elsewhere.

AB Inputs of mercury (Hg) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in throughfall and stemflow waters were measured for an upland/bog watershed in northern Minnesota, and were compared to the deposition in a nearby opening to determine the influence of tree canopies on Hg and DOC deposition. Twice as much Hg and seven times as much DOC was deposited in the forested watershed compared to the opening. Mass balance studies that are based on wet-only deposition in openings severely underestimate atmospheric deposition of Hg in forests. Conifer canopies are more efficient filters of airborne particulates than are deciduous canopies as indicated by much higher Hg concentrations and total deposition in throughfall and stemflow waters under conifers. Significant positive relationships existed between Hg and DOC in both throughfall (36-57% of the variation) and stemflow waters (55-88% of the variation). Hg complexation by DOC appears to be related to the contact time between precipitation and carbon sources.

AB Peatland ecosystems store about 500-600 Pg of organic carbon, largely accumulated since the last glaciation. Whether they continue to sequester carbon or release it as greenhouse gases, perhaps in large amounts, is important in Earth's temperature dynamics. Given both ages and depths of numerous dated sample peatlands, their rate of carbon sequestration can be estimated throughout the Holocene. Here we use average values for carbon content per unit volume, the geographical extent of peatlands, and ecological models of peatland establishment and growth, to reconstruct the time-trajectory of peatland carbon sequestration in North America and project it into the future. Peatlands there contain similar to 163 Pg of carbon. Ignoring effects of climate change and other major anthropogenic disturbances, the rate of carbon accumulation is projected to decline slowly over millennia as reduced net carbon accumulation in existing peatlands is largely balanced by new peatland establishment. Peatland; are one of few long-term terrestrial carbon sinks, probably important for global carbon regulation in future generations. This study contributes to a better understanding of these ecosystems that will assist their inclusion in earth-system models, and therefore their management to maintain carbon storage during climate change.

AB Organic material leached from the organic (O) horizon of soils is a major source of natural organic matter (NOM) in surface waters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a known precursor for the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), including trihalomethanes (THMs), formed during chlorination. In this study the concentration and composition of leachable O2 horizon DOC from 5 habitats within a United Kingdom upland reservoir catchment (beech, spruce, larch, and pine forests and blanket peat) were compared with an emphasis on potential treatment implications using XAD fractionation and THM formation potential (THMFP) tests. Statistically significant differences were found between habitats, with pine and larch leachates yielding particularly high DOC concentrations (mean 19.3 and 13.4 mg/L, respectively) and THMFP7d values (mean 1306 and 1527 mu g/L, respectively). The interspecies variation observed suggests that the typical distinction made between deciduous and coniferous species in previous studies is overly simplistic. Interestingly, peat leachate exhibited a surprisingly low DOC concentration (mean 9.0 mg/L), suggesting that the high DOC flux associated with these habitats may be the result of other factors such as depth of organic matter and mineral content. Averaged across all habitats, mean standardized THMFP (STHMFP) was highest in the hydrophobic acid (HPOA) fraction, although substantial differences in the relative reactivities of fractions were found between habitats. Synergistic effects are also likely to complicate the relationship between fractional character and STHMFP.

AB A field study was undertaken to compare dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in soil solutions obtained with three different sampling methods over a range of soil types. The sampling devices used were a tension-free collector, a tension Prenart collector and a tension Rhizon collector. Samples were collected fortnightly for a year at seven sites in northern England, each collection being replicated three times. The soil solution DOC ranged from 1.3 g m(-3) in an acid ranker to 34.7 g m(-3) in a peat. The DOC concentrations obtained with the three methods correlated reasonably well (r(2) - 0.6-0.8) but with an indication of bias, as the best fit line differed from the 1:1 line. The tension-free collector gave generally higher DOC concentrations except at very low concentrations (in the acid ranker soil). The DOC concentrations measured with the tension-free collectors were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those obtained with Prenart and Rhizon collectors at four and six sites, out of seven, respectively. Subsequent laboratory tests on tension-free collected samples showed no DOC loss on filtration through 0.1 and 0.22-mu m membranes, whereas a significant loss of DOC occurred when tension-free collected samples were subsequently passed through Prenart and Rhizon collectors, indicating a probable sampling artefact with the tension devices. The difficulties of acquiring representative soil solution samples are discussed, together with the advantages and disadvantages of tension and tension-free methods.

AB The contribution of different methanogenic precursors probably depends on vegetation in the cold Zoige peatlands. This study was carried out to elucidate the relationship between archaeal community dynamics and vegetation type over growing season. Soil samples were collected monthly during the growing season from two vegetation types (communities dominated by Carex muliensis vs. Eleocharis valleculosa) on an open fen at the Wetland National Nature Reserve of the Zoige peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Archaeal community structure was determined with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 16S rRNA gene fragment. Methanosarcinales, Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriales, uncultured RC-II, and uncultured Crenarchaeota were detected in both vegetation types. The results suggested that seasonal change affects the activity rather than the structure of the archaeal community over the growing season. Ordination analyses indicated that archaeal community composition was related to vegetation type and plant height.

AB Plant species composition influences belowground ecosystem function. However, there are few data on the interactive effects of plant diversity and soil function. We surveyed plant species diversity, and determined soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) fractions and enzyme activity in five peatlands with different vegetation-types. We also investigated the interactions between plant species diversity and richness, and soil biochemical properties. We found a close relationship between plant species diversity and total carbon (TC) in both surface (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm) layers. Plant diversity and richness positively correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+-N in both soil layers and subsoil moisture and total nitrogen (TN), as well as topsoil pH. Plant species diversity and richness were also positively correlated with subsoil moisture, pH, protease, acid phosphatase activity and topsoil urease activity. Soil beta-glucosidase, invertase, urease, protease, and acid phosphatase activity positively correlated with soil TC, TN, DOC, available N and soil moisture. Our findings demonstrate that plant community diversity is linked with soil C and N turnover through soil enzyme activity. These results will improve our ability to more fully understand the linkages between aboveground and belowground components in peatland ecosystems.

AB Understanding the biogeochemistry of metal-contaminated peatlands is important for predicting the impact of mining and industrial activities on peatlands and downstream surface waters and for predicting recovery of previously impacted sites. The objective of this work was to characterize the factors controlling spatial and temporal variability in surface peat (015 cm) and pore water chemistry of 18 regionally representative peatlands in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The pollution gradient is clearly evident as Cu and Ni concentrations in surface peat are elevated close to the main Copper Cliff smelter. Surface peat also differs greatly in acidity (pH) and organic matter content among sites, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in pore water are positively correlated with peat carbon content. In addition, sites having surface peat that is more decomposed also have pore water DOC that is more humified. Pore water chemistry varies seasonally; samples taken in late summer and fall were characterized by higher SO4, and lower pH and higher concentrations of base cations and metals such as Ni, Co, and Mn compared with those in late spring that had higher DOC, higher pH, and higher concentrations of metals such as Cu and Fe. Despite the large spatial and temporal variability in pore water chemistry, soil-solution partitioning (Kd) of some metals (Ni, Co, and Mn) can be explained by pH alone. Modeling soil-solution partitioning for these metals and Cu, Al, and Fe is significantly improved with the addition of SO4; dissolved organic matter quality and quantity and/or the delta O-18 signature of the pore water in regression models indicating several factors other than acidity has an influence on pore water chemistry.

AB Natural peatlands provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage and habitat, which can be negatively affected (degraded) by the proximity of agricultural land due to lowered water table and increased nutrient deposition. We assessed peat biochemistry and microbial function in the dry, fluctuating and saturated zones of the peat deposits at Moanatuatua (degraded) and Kopuatai (intact) raised bogs in New Zealand to investigate the effects of adjacent agriculture on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Peat C and N density were elevated, due in part to greater bulk density, in the dry and saturated zones at Moanatuatua compared with Kopuatai. Functional capacity (multi-substrate induced respiration) at Moanatuatua was greater than at Kopuatai, and water-soluble C was at lower concentration but more degradable, indicating that microbes were C limited at Moanatuatua but N limited at Kopuatai. Greater microbial function at Moanatuatua infers C inputs may be more rapidly converted to gaseous or waterborne exports, and agriculturally affected peatlands may be more susceptible to losses of labile C. We conclude that proximity to agriculture is likely to have caused changes in chemical properties and altered microbial functioning of restiad bog and has important implications for C and N turnover within these peatland systems.

AB Carbon gases with younger C-14 ages than those of the surrounding peat have been reported from continental boreal peatlands, a fact which suggests that significant movement of CO2, CH4, or DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and export of C via subsurface processes are not accounted for in most estimates of contributions to the C cycle. This paper tests the hypothesis that similar processes can occur in oceanic ombrotrophic mires where water and gas movement is theoretically minimal. Measurements of C-14 and delta(13)C in CO2, CH4, and DOC, and of tritium, are reported from depths to 250 cm at Tor Royal, a raised mire in southwest England. Radiocarbon ages of gases are 1460 to 500 yr younger than those of peat from the same depths, and CO2 is consistently younger than CH4. DOC is 1260 to 830 yr younger than the peat, and significant amounts of tritium were found at all depths, Gas ages are mostly intermediate between the age of the peat and that of the DOC, which suggests that C is principally transported as DOC. However, some gases are younger than their associated DOG, which implies that movement of dissolved gases may also take place. delta(13)C values in gases suggest that CO2 reduction is the major pathway for CH4 production. Transport of C in deep peats is likely to be a significant component in the overall C budget of ombrotrophic oceanic peatlands, and C export via discharge to ground or surface waters may be an important mechanism for gaseous C emissions.

AB There is increasing evidence that drought is leading to increased loss of dissolved organic carbon from upland peats. Therefore, this study endeavours to understand the severity and frequency of the scale of drought responsible for driving the observed changes; and, by reconstructing climatic records, to understand whether such droughts are increasing in severity and frequency. The study suggests that there are two levels of drought severity important in the peatlands: a hydrological drought that causes hydrophobic effects in the upper peat profile lasting 3-4 years in duration, and a more severe biogeochemical drought that triggers new mechanisms of DOC production and decade-long effects. The study uses long term climate data from Central England and Northern England to reconstructs depth to water table for an upland peat catchment back to 1766 and shows that hydrological drought has a return period of 25 years and that biogeochemical drought has a return period of 15.5 years. Statistical modelling of the time series of annual droughts shows only weak evidence for an increasing frequency of severe droughts since 1766, but stronger evidence for the recent past. The return period of drought of sufficient severity to cause biogeochemical response is coming close to the length of effect such a drought would have, i.e. trends in drought frequency mean that peatlands may no longer be resilient to the impact of drought, with dire consequences for the storage of carbon in these environments.

AB Any change in the ability of northern peatlands to act as a sink for atmospheric CO2 will play a crucial part in the response of the Earth system to global warming. We argue that a true assessment of the sink-source relationships of peatland ecosystems requires that losses of C in drainage waters be included when determining annual net C uptake, thus connecting measurements of stream C fluxes with those made at the land surface-atmosphere interface. This was done by combining estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) with stream water measurements of TOC, DIC, and gaseous C loss, in a 335-ha lowland temperate peatland catchment (55degrees48.80'N, 03degrees14.40'W) in central Scotland over a 2-year period (1996-1998). Mean annual downstream C flux was 304 (+/-62) kg C ha(-1) yr(-1), of which total organic carbon (TOC) contributed 93%, the remainder being dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and free CO2. At the catchment outlet evasion loss of CO2 from the stream surface was estimated to be an additional 46 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Over the study period, NEE of CO2-C resulted in a flux from the atmosphere to the land surface of 278 (+/-25) kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Net C loss in drainage water, including both the downstream flux and CO2 evasion from the stream surface to the atmosphere, was therefore greater or equal to the net annual C uptake as a result of photosynthesis/respiration at the land surface. By combining these and other flux terms, the overall C mass balance suggests that this system was either acting as a terrestrial C source or was C neutral.

AB The aim of the present study was to use the analysis of surface water chemistry to understand vegetation succession pathways in terrestrializing polyhumic lakes. We hypothesized that Sphagnum mire development was accompanied by a decrease in the mineral content in water. A total of 111 vegetation plots along 23 transects were analysed in 11 lakes and adjacent peat lands in the Wigry National Park (NE Poland). The vegetation of the lake-mire systems forms distinct zones: (1) nymphaeid-, bladderwort- and bryophyte-dominated aquatic vegetation; (2) sedge-dominated edge of the Sphagnumcarpet; (3) quaking, extremely poor fen with various Cyperaceae; (4) non-quaking, Eriophorum vaginatum-dominated bog-like vegetation and (5) pine woodland. Surface water corrected conductivity (ECcorr.), pH, COD-KMnO4 and Ca2+, Mg2+, Fetot. and SiO2 were measured along the transects. The environmental gradients best explaining the observed pattern were pH (with the highest values in the lake and the lowest in the bog-like vegetation) and COD-KMnO4 (showing an inverse direction). At least in some Sphagnummires conditions were more minerotrophic than in the lakes. The process of humic lake overgrowing by Sphagnum-mires in NE Poland results in pine woodlands on mineralised peat. The climate conditions in NE Poland, combined with evapotranspiration accelerated by encroaching trees, do not seem to support the development of ombrotrophic bogs.

AB The article presents the results of lichenological studies at the territories of Meshchersky National Park (Klepiky district and Ryazan district of the Ryazan Region, Russia) and Meshchera National Park (Gus-Khrustalny district of the Vladimir Region, Russia). Both Protected Areas represent an entire natural-anthropogenic area created in 1992 to preserve the unique forests and wetlands of the Meshchera Lowland, and to restore forest-marsh territories damaged by draining and long-term extraction of peat. Both the national parks are located in the centre of the Meshchera Lowland, in the basin of the River Pra (left-side tributary of the River Oka), and its tributaries-the River Buzha and the River Pol. In 2008-2018, we studied the lichen diversity using the traditional route method with more detailed studies within 64 sample plots. The following habitat types were inspected: pine forests, mixed forests and small-leaved forests, floodplain oak forest, swamps, meadows and heaths, shores of water bodies, and anthropogenic biotopes. Material of previous studies was also included in the analysis. An annotated list included 199 lichen species and eight non-lichenised fungus-related species which are traditionally counted in lichen lists. They belong to 88 genera and 43 families. The similarity of the lichen lists of the two national parks is 0.63 according to the Sorensen-Dice index. Cladonia bacilliformis, Lecania naegelii, Peltigera polydactylon, Porpidia crustulata, Pycnora praestabilis, and Xylopsora caradocensis were new species for the Vladimir region. Cladonia bacilliformis, C. cervicornis, C. floerkeana, and Stictis mollis were new species for the Ryazan region. Cetraria ericetorum, Cladonia bacilliformis, C. cervicornis, C. floerkeana, Peltigera extenuata, Stictis mollis were new species for the Meshchersky National Park. Chaenotheca furfuracea, Cladonia bacilliformis, Lecania naegelii, Peltigera polydactylon, Porpidia crustulata, Pycnora praestabilis, Xylopsora caradocensis were new for the Meshchera National Park. Acrocordia gemmata, Bacidia rubella, Chaenotheca stemonea, Chaenothecopsis pusiola, and Cladonia parasitica were considered as indicators of old-growth and undisturbed forests. Four rare species (Bryoria fuscescens, B. nadvornikiana, Cetraria ericetorum, and Peltigera extenuata) are listed in the Red Data Book of the Ryazan region. The following 19 species are rare for the centre of European Russia: Absconditella delutula, Acarospora versicolor, Arthonia fusca, Bacidia friesii, Biatora albohyalina, Cladonia sulphurina, Lecania suavis, Lecanora fuscescens, Micarea erratica, Microcalicium ahlneri, Ochrolechia androgyna, Porpidia soredizodes, Rhizocarpon reductum, Stictis mollis, Thelocarpon laureri, Thelloma ocellatum, Toninia athallina, Trapelia placodioides, and Xanthoparmelia stenophylla. In total, the species richness of lichen biotas in both national parks is equivalent to that in the Oka State Nature Reserve (208 species).

AB We examined how different landscape areas in a catchment containing a northern ombrotrophic peatland and upland mineral soils responded to dramatic decreases in atmospheric deposition of lead (Pb). Pb concentrations in the outflow stream from the peatland measured from 2009-2015 indicated continued mobilization and export of Pb derived from historic inputs to the bog. In contrast, Pb concentrations in surface peat and runoff from upland mineral soils have declined in response to reductions in atmospheric deposition. Relative to the early 1980s, Pb concentrations in the streamflow decreased only 50%, while Pb in surface peat and upland subsurface runoff decreased by more than 90%. Water level fluctuations in the slow accumulating peat have allowed dissolved organic matter (DOM) to continue mobilizing Pb deposited in the peatland decades earlier. Strong correlations between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Pb concentrations in outflow from the peatland and in bog porewaters demonstrate Pb mobility related to DOM production. Peat stores of Pb in 2016 were less than or equal to those reported in the early 1980s despite the dry mass inventory increasing by 60-80%. Much of the loss in Pb stored in peat can be accounted for by stream runoff from the peatland.

AB Soil organic matter is an important source of allochthonous dissolved organic matter inputs to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta waterways, which is a drinking water source for 22 million people in California, USA. Knowledge of trihalomethane (THM) formation potential of soil-derived organic carbon is important for developing effective strategies for organic carbon removal in drinking water treatment. In this study, soil organic carbon was extracted with electrolytes (deionized H2O and Na- or Ca-based electrolytes) of electrical conductivity bracketing those found in Delta leaching and runoff conditions. The extracts were physically and chemically separated into different fractions: colloidal organic carbon (0.45-0.1 mu m), fine colloidal organic carbon (0.1-0.025 mu m), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (< 0.025 mu m); hydrophobic acid (HPOA), transphilic acid, and hydrophilic acid. Two representative Delta soils, Rindge Muck (a peat soil) and Scribner Clay Loam (a mineral soil) were examined. Results showed that less than 2% of soil organic carbon was electrolyte-extractable and heterogeneous organic fractions with distinct THM reactivity existed. Regardless of soil and electrolytes, DOC and HPOA fractions were dominant in terms of total concentration and THMFP. The amounts of extractable organic carbon and THMFP were dependent on the cation and to a lesser extent on electrical conductivity of electrolytes. Along with our previous study on temperature and moisture effects on DOC production, we propose a conceptual model to describe the impacts of agricultural practices on DOC production in the Delta. DOC is mainly produced in the surface peat soils during the summer and is immobilized by accumulated salt in the soils. DOC is leached from soils to drainage ditches and finally to the Delta channels during winter salt leaching practices. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ten substrates were evaluated for their capacity to promote the growth of potted Lantana camara. The substrates consisted of different volumetric proportions of sandy loam soil (S), peat (P), perlite (Per), and urea formaldehyde resin foam (UFRF referred to as F), the latter in an effort to substitute peat use in horticulture. The substrates studied were: S, S-60:P-40, S-40:P-60, S-60:P-40, S-40:F-60, P-60:F-40, P-40:F-60, S-40:P-30:Per(30), S-40:F-30:Per(30), and P-50:Per(50). Measurements included: 1) substrate physical and chemical characteristics such as water characteristic curves, bulk density, total porosity, easily available water, and pH; 2) biometric measurements such as shoot length and number and number of flowers; and 3) determination of main and lateral stems, leaf, flower, and root dry weights. Results showed that substrates P-60: F-40 and P-40: F-60 retained excessive water in all tensions, whereas substrate P-50:Per(50) exhibited increased water retention at saturation that was quickly reduced after 10 cm of tension. The non-amended soil (S) had the least water retention capacity and proved to be a slow-draining substrate. Supplementation either with peat or peat and perlite (S-60:P-40, S-40:P-60, and S-40:P-30:Per(30)) significantly increased water retention in the soil-based substrates. Soil-based substrates supplemented with UFRF retained less water compared with peat-amended soil-based substrates. Concerning plant growth, Lantana plants growing in the UFRF-amended substrates were unable to recover from frost injury and their evaluation was interrupted after winter as a result of total plant loss. The injury was attributed to the reduction of plant growth in UFRF-supplemented substrates before the occurrence of frost stress events. Soil-based substrates (S, S60:1340, S-40:P-60, and S-40:P-30:Per(30)) provided greater shoot growth, which was almost twofold compared with substrate P-50:Per(50). Substrate S-40:P-30:Per(30)) produced the most lateral shoots and flowers over the whole study period, whereas S-40:P-60 produced the most flowers during the summer. Dry weights of both stem and lateral stems followed a similar pattern with the biometric measurements. However the non-amended soil (S) produced the highest leaf and root dry weights followed by substrates S-60:P-40 and S-40:P-60. It was concluded that both substrates S-40:P-60 and S-40:P-30:Per(30) can successfully be used for Lantana nursery production as a result of their decreased bulk density, increased water retention capacity, adequate porosity, and promotion of shoot growth and flowering. Despite its high bulk density, substrate S could be used in the production of Lantana plants for landscape use as a result of the increased root production.

AB Peatlands long have been considered to preserve the record of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic contaminants such as Pb.  In the past two decades, Pb-210 hs been widely used to date recent strata of peat and to calculate accumulation rates.  The assumption that Pb and Pb-210 are immobile and not subject to diagenesis in peat has been questioned but not rigorously tested.  We attempted to determine if Pb is mobile in peatlands and Pb profiles are altered by diagenic processes by constructing a mass balance for Pb about a small peatland, by comparing inventories, concentrations, and accumulation rates of Pb and Pb-210 in peatlands across northeastern North America, and by examining the relationship between concentrations of Pb in bog waters and peat in numerous sites.  Our results clearly demonstrate that Pb and Pb-210 are mobilized by the organic-rich waters of peatlands.  Profiles of Pb and Pb-210 at depths below the water table do not preserve the record of atmospheric deposition, and inventories fo Pb and Pb-210 are depleted in peatland hollows.  Concentrations of Pb in bog waters are regulated by the concentration of Pb in the peat and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon.  The mass balance for one bog indicated that over the specific three-year period of study more than 30% of inputs of Pb were not retained within the peat.  As a result of this mobility, dates based on Pb-210 can be biased and inaccurate by as much as 30 years.  Dates based on Pb-210 should be verified by other techniques, especially when the inventory of Pb-210 is less than that expected from local rates of deposition.

AB Concerns have been raised about rising trends in surface water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in UK upland catchments over the past decades. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these trends, including changes in climate and declines in sulfate deposition across Europe. Drier summers and wetter winters are projected in the UK, and there is an increasing interest in whether the rising trends of DOC would be continued or stabilized. In this paper, the INCA (INtegrated CAtchment) water quality model was applied to the upland catchment of the River Severn at Plynlimon in Wales and used to simulate the effects of both climate and sulfate deposition on surface water DOC concentrations. We introduced new parameter sets of INCA to explain enzymatic latch effect in peatlands during droughts. The model was able to simulate recent past (1995-2013) rising trends in DOC in Plynlimon. Climatic projections were employed to estimate the future trends on DOC in the uplands and to consider potential impacts on catchment management. The model was run with climatic scenarios generated using the weather@home2 climate modeling platform and with sulfate deposition scenarios from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) for 1975-2100. The modeling results show that the rising DOC trends are likely to continue in the near future (2020-2049) and the level of DOC concentrations is projected to stabilize in the far future (2070-2099). However, in the far future, the seasonal patterns of DOC concentrations will change, with a post-drought DOC surge in autumn months.

AB D The stream-riparian interface, characterized by a dynamic and complex hydrology, is an important control point for nutrient fluxes and processing between terrestrial and aquatic systems. Predicted alterations in the discharge regime in Mediterranean climate regions make it necessary to understand the effects of abrupt hydrological transition between dry and wet conditions on the transport and fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) across the stream-riparian interface. In this study, the concentrations and fate of total DOC (TDOC) and a subset of four molecular weight fractions (< 1 kDa, 1-10 kDa, 10-100 kDa, > 100 kDa) were investigated in stream water and riparian groundwater during autumn of 2003 and 2004. The two study periods were characterized by contrasting antecedent hydrological conditions: the streamflow was interrupted in summer 2003 but was permanent in summer 2004. Comparison of the two study periods indicates that an abrupt dry-wet hydrological transition amplifies the water exchange across the stream-riparian interface and favors retention of up to 57% of the TDOC that flows across the interface. Furthermore, the efficiency of DOC retention across the stream-riparian interface also varies greatly depending on DOC molecular size. More than 70% of DOC fractions higher than 10 kDa were retained, whereas the smaller fraction (less than 1 kDa) was nearly conserved. Consequently, our study helps to clarify the effects of extreme hydrological events on DOC transport in running waters in Mediterranean regions.

AB Northern peatlands are an important source for greenhouse gases, but their capacity to produce methane remains uncertain under changing climatic conditions. We therefore analyzed a 43year time series of the pore-water chemistry to determine if long-term shifts in precipitation altered the vertical transport of solutes within a large peat basin in northern Minnesota. These data suggest that rates of methane production can be finely tuned to multidecadal shifts in precipitation that drive the vertical penetration of labile carbon substrates within the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands. Tritium and cation profiles demonstrate that only the upper meter of these peat deposits was flushed by downwardly moving recharge from 1965 to 1983 during a Transitional Dry-to-Moist Period. However, a shift to a moister climate after 1984 drove surface waters much deeper, largely flushing the pore waters of all bogs and fens to depths of 2m. Labile carbon compounds were transported downward from the rhizosphere to the basal peat at this time producing a substantial enrichment of methane in C-14 with respect to the solid-phase peat from 1991 to 2008. These data indicate that labile carbon substrates can fuel deep production zones of methanogenesis that more than doubled in thickness across this large peat basin after 1984. Moreover, the entire peat profile apparently has the capacity to produce methane from labile carbon substrates depending on climate-driven modes of solute transport. Future changes in precipitation may therefore play a central role in determining the source strength of peatlands in the global methane cycle.

AB The historical development of the hydroseral vegetation of three humic lakes was studied. We applied a combination of methods to reconstruct the past vegetation (plant macroscopic remains, peat decomposition, sediment chemistry and radiocarbon dating). The contemporary environment of these lakes was assessed by vegetation and water chemistry analyses. The oldest foreshore sediments were formed 13075-12700 cal BP (Lake Suchar VI), 10115-9670 cal BP (Lake Suchar III) and 8747-8479 cal BP (Lake Widne). The differences in contemporary vegetation are reflected in the subfossil plant assemblages. From the beginning, poor fens and bogs occurred beside Lake Suchar III, moderately rich and poor fens were developed at Lake Suchar VI, while reedswamps and moderately rich fens occurred at Lake Widne. The foreshore vegetation changed over time but only within a restricted range, specific for each lake corresponding to the hydrochemical differences between the lakes. Lakes are classified as humic if some features are combined, such as the specific vegetation and water parameters. However, over the past few decades escalating climatic and anthropogenic changes could transform the character of these water bodies. The application of multidisciplinary methods permitted comparison of the development of three apparently similar lakes and identification of significant ecological differences.

AB Where they are present in catchments, peatlands are a dominant source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to surrounding waterways due, in part, to high production rates. Despite the preponderance of peatlands in northern latitudes and expected peatland vulnerability to climate change, little is known about peatland DOM degradation relative to a more comprehensive understanding of degradation when DOM is sourced from upland-dominated catchments. We compared DOM biodegradability of various sources of stream water in two catchments having peatlands (22%-33% of the area) surrounded by upland forests (70%-90% of the area, either deciduous or coniferous). We measured total organic carbon (TOC), and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon concentrations; bacterial respiration rates; streamflow; and upland runoff during and after snowmelt (March to June, 2009-2011). We also explored if DOM in upland runoff stimulated biodegradation of peatland-derived DOM (i.e., a priming effect), and if forest cover type affected DOM biodegradability. As expected, the peatlands were the largest sources of both water (72%-80%) and TOC (92%-96%) to the streams although more area in each catchment was in uplands (70%-90%). Several results were unexpected, yet revealing: (1) DOM from peatlands sometimes had the same biodegradability as DOM from uplands, (2) upland sources of DOM had negligible effects on biodegradability in the peatland and downstream, and (3) upland deciduous cover did not yield more degradable DOM than conifer cover. The most pronounced effect of upland runoff was dilution of downstream TOC concentrations when there was upland runoff. Overall, the effects of upland DOM may have been negligible due to the overriding effect of the large amount of biodegradable DOM that originated in bogs. This research highlights that peatland-sourced DOM has important effects on downstream DOM biodegradability even in catchments where upland area is substantially larger than peatland area.

AB In-situ UV-Vis spectrophotometers offer the potential for improved estimates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes for organic-rich systems such as peatlands because they are able to sample and log DOC proxies automatically through time at low cost. In turn, this could enable improved total carbon budget estimates for peatlands. The ability of such instruments to accurately measure DOC depends on a number of factors, not least of which is how absorbance measurements relate to DOC and the environmental conditions. Here we test the ability of a S::can Spectro:dyser (TM) for measuring DOC in peatland streams with routinely high DOC concentrations. Through analysis of the spectral response data collected by the instrument we have been able to accurately measure DOC up to 66 mg L-1, which is more than double the original upper calibration limit for this particular instrument. A linear regression modelling approach resulted in an accuracy >95%. The greatest accuracy was achieved when absorbance values for several different wavelengths were used at the same time in the model. However, an accuracy >90% was achieved using absorbance values for a single wavelength to predict DOC concentration. Our calculations indicated that, for organic-rich systems, in-situ measurement with a scanning spectrophotometer can improve fluvial DOC flux estimates by 6 to 8% compared with traditional sampling methods. Thus, our techniques pave the way for improved long-term carbon budget calculations from organic-rich systems such as peatlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The FORWARD project, based on the Boreal Plain of Alberta, was initiated to develop models to predict the influence of watershed disturbance on runoff and stream water quality. To generate hypotheses relating to watershed controls on streams in the presence and absence of disturbance, we quantified relationships between stream variables and soil distribution in nine undisturbed small (M = 5.4 km(2)) watersheds for two relatively dry and snowmelt-dominated seasons (May through October 2002 and 2003). We also considered data from one harvested and two burned watersheds. Among soil types, only peatland cover had an association with runoff and water quality. Runoff and ammonium exports were positively related to peatland cover in both years (r(2) = 0.50 to 0.90; P < 0.05). In the first year, additional relationships to peatland cover existed for particulate phosphorus and suspended sediment exports (r(2) = 0.64 and 0.65, respectively), whereas in the second year they existed for dissolved phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon exports (r(2) = 0.67 and 0.78, respectively). Hypotheses generated relate to the role of peatlands as sources for water moving toward stream channels, water exchange between streams and riparian groundwater, and the influence of disturbance and precipitation patterns on runoff generation.

AB Agricultural peat soils in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California have been identified as an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and trihalomethane precursors in waters exported for drinking. The objectives of this study were to examine the primary sources of DOC from soil profiles (surface vs. subsurface), factors (temperature, soil water content and wet-dry cycles) controlling DOC production, and the relationship between C mineralization and DOC concentration in cultivated peat soils. Surface and subsurface peat soils were incubated for 60 d under a range of temperature (10, 20, and 30 degrees C) and soil water contents (0.3-10.0 g-water g-soil(-1)). Both CO2-C and DOC were monitored during the incubation period. Results showed that significant amount of DOC was produced only in the surface soil under constantly flooded conditions or flooding/non-flooding cycles. The DOC production was independent of temperature and soil water content under non-flooded condition, although CO2 evolution was highly correlated with these parameters. Aromatic carbon and hydrophobic acid contents in surface DOC were increased with wetter incubation treatments. In addition, positive linear correlations (r(2) = 0. 87) between CO2-C mineralization rate and DOC concentration were observed in the surface soil, but negative linear correlations (r(2) = 0.70) were observed in the subsurface soil. Results imply that mineralization of soil organic carbon by microbes prevailed in the subsurface soil.

AB The Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) of northern Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec, Canada is the second largest contiguous peatland complex in the world, currently containing more than half of Canada's soil carbon. Recent concerns about the ecohydrological impacts to these large northern peatlands resulting from climate change and resource extraction have catalyzed a resurgence in scientific research into this ecologically important region. However, the sheer size, heterogeneity and elaborate landscape arrangements of this ecosystem raise important questions concerning representative sampling of environmental media for chemical or physical characterization. To begin to quantify such variability, this study assessed the small-scale spatial (1 m) and short temporal (21 day) variability of surface pore-water biogeochemistry (pH, dissolved organic carbon, and major ions) in a Sphagnum spp.-dominated, ombrotrophic raised bog, and a Carex spp.-dominated intermediate fen in the HBL. In general, pore-water pH and concentrations of dissolved solutes were similar to previously reported literature values from this region. However, systematic sampling revealed consistent statistically significant differences in pore-water chemistries between the bog and fen peatland types, and large within-site spatiotemporal variability. We found that microtopography in the bog was associated with consistent differences in most biogeochemical variables. Temporal changes in dissolved solute chemistry, particularly base cations (Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+), were statistically significant in the intermediate fen, likely a result of a dynamic connection between surficial waters and mineral-rich deep groundwater. In both the bog and fen, concentrations of SO42- showed considerable spatial variability, and a significant decrease in concentrations over the study period. The observed variability in peatland pore-water biogeochemistry over such small spatial and temporal scales suggests that under-sampling in northern peatland environments could lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the abundance and distribution of natural elements and pollutants alike.

AB Over the millennia, peatlands have sequestered and stored carbon in the form of peat, that today accounts for around 30% of the global soil organic carbon. The peat has formed and accumulated due to the slow decomposition rate of organic matter in waterlogged, anaerobic conditions. The particularly close interdependence of the carbon and water cycles in peatland ecosystems signal the importance of understanding the water cycle to the functioning of peatlands.
   With this aim, the water and energy cycle of an alpine catchment in Italy, which includes a peatland, was studied using the process-based hydrological model GEOtop and a set of in situ measurements over 4 years (2012-2015). This is a challenging modelling exercise that has not been tried before with GEOtop. The catchment is heterogenous with land covers of peatland, grassland, scree and bare rock in a mountainous area. The GEOtop model was able to replicate the energy and water fluxes measured by an eddy covariance tower located in the peatland as well as the volumetric water content and soil temperature of the peatland accurately over the four years. This study shows that a process-based hydrological model can be used to study the water and energy dynamics of a peatland in a mountainous area.

AB Transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from land to water is an important but poorly known component of northern carbon cycles. We examined seasonal patterns of arctic river DOC flux, focusing on the largely uncharacterized snowmelt period. High-intensity sampling of the Kolyma River showed rapid increases in DOC concentration during peak discharge, yielding unique DOC-water flux relationships compared to summer, fall and winter. Our annual DOC flux estimates were 31% higher than previous estimates for the basin based on few or no snowmelt samples. Synthesis of the sparse literature show that 55% of arctic river DOC flux occurs during snowmelt. Biogeochemical characterizations of DOC in large rivers are usually done after snowmelt runoff, and are thus unrepresentative of most DOC transported to the Arctic Ocean. Finally, the proportion of annual DOC flux at snowmelt is considerably higher than for water, suggesting that cold season production is an important but little known process regulating arctic DOC transport.

AB Constructed wetlands are used worldwide to improve water quality while also providing critical wetland habitat. However, wetlands have the potential to negatively impact drinking water quality by exporting dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that upon disinfection can form disinfection byproducts (DBPs) like trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). We used a replicated field-scale study located on organic rich soils in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to test whether constructed flow-through wetlands which receive water high in DOC that is treated with either iron-or aluminum-based coagulants can improve water quality with respect to DBP formation. Coagulation alone removed DOC (66-77%) and THM (67-70%) precursors, and was even more effective at removing HAA precursors (77-90%). Passage of water through the wetlands increased DOC concentrations (1.5-7.5 mg L-1), particularly during the warmer summer months, thereby reversing some of the benefits from coagulant addition. Despite this addition, water exiting the wetlands treated with coagulants had lower DOC and DBP precursor concentrations relative to untreated source water. Benefits of the coagulation-wetland systems were greatest during the winter months (approx. 50-70% reduction in DOC and DBP precursor concentrations) when inflow water DOC concentrations were higher and wetland DOC production was lower. Optical properties suggest DOC in this system is predominantly comprised of high molecular weight, aromatic compounds, likely derived from degraded peat soils. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Water quality was monitored in the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge based on the Consent Decree (CDN), the Enhanced Refuge (ERN), the four-part Test impacted (FPTIN), and the four-part test unimpacted (FPTUN) networks. Alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon, total organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, turbidity, pH, specific conductivity, calcium, chloride, silicon, sulfate, and total phosphorus (TP) were measured from 2005 through 2009. When the ERN was used, the 10 mu g TP L-1 Consent Decree limit would have been exceeded and would have ranged from a low of 2 months in 2009 to a high of 9 months in 2005. Based on the CDN, the limit exceeded only for 1 month in each year from 2006 through 2008. Based on the FPTIN, the 10 mu g TP L-1 limit would have been exceeded and would have ranged from a low of 1 month in 2007 to a high of 7 months in 2005 and 2008. Based on the CDN, the limit only exceeded for 1 month in each year from 2006 through 2008. Since TP is rapidly removed from canal water intruded into the Refuge marsh, one cannot expect a water quality sampling station located 2 km from the source to reliably detect violations. This may be the primary reason why there have been very few months when TP concentration has exceeded the limit since 1992 or part four of the four-part test annual 15 mu g L-1 limit since 2006.

AB To obtain better constraints on the control of seasonal hydrological variations on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in headwater catchments, we combined hydrometric monitoring with high-frequency analyses of DOC concentration and DOC chemical composition (specific UV adsorption, C-13) in soil and stream waters during one complete hydrological cycle in a small lowland catchment of western France. We observed a succession of four hydrological periods, each corresponding to specific DOC signatures. In particular, the rise of the upland water table at the end of the rewetting period yielded to a strong increase of the specific UV absorbance (from 2.5 to 4.0 L mg C-1 m(-1)) and of the C-13 values (from -29 to -27) of the soil DOC. Another striking feature was the release of large amounts of DOC during reduction of soil Fe-oxyhydroxides at the end of the high-flow period. Comparison of hydrometric data with DOC composition metrics showed that soils from the upland domains were rapidly DOC depleted after the rise of the water table in these domains, whereas wetland soils acted as quasi-infinite DOC sources. Results from this study showed that the composition and ultimate source of the DOC exported to the stream will depend on the period within the annual hydrological cycle. However, we found that the aromatic DOC component identified during the high-flow period will likely represent the dominant DOC component in stream waters on an annual basis, because most of the annual stream DOC flux is exported during such periods.

AB In this study, we contrast the fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fens and bogs in a Northern Minnesota peatland using excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). EEM-PARAFAC identified four humic-like components and one protein-like component and the dynamics of each were evaluated based on their distribution with depth as well as across sites differing in hydrology and major biological species. The PARAFAC-EEM experiments were supported by dissolved organic carbon measurements (DOC), optical spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and compositional characterization by ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy (FT-ICR MS). The FT-ICR MS data indicate that metabolism in peatlands reduces the molecular weights of individual components of DOM, and oxygen-rich less aromatic molecules are selectively biodegraded. Our data suggest that different hydrologic and biological conditions within the larger peat ecosystem drive molecular changes in DOM, resulting in distinctly different chemical compositions and unique fluorescent fingerprints. PARAFAC modeling of EEM data coupled with ultrahigh resolution FT-ICR MS has the potential to provide significant molecular-based information on DOM composition that will support efforts to better understand the composition, sources, and diagenetic status of DOM from different terrestrial and aquatic systems.

AB Purpose Wetland gaseous carbon (C) emissions have been widely used to evaluate temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition (indicated byQ(10)). However, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux as an important pathway for soil solid-phase organic carbon losses has seldom been considered in such estimations, which may introduce bias in predictions of wetland soil C-climate feedback. Hence, this study aimed to explore whether and how the temperature sensitivity of wetland SOC decomposition is affected by DOC flux. Materials and methods We carried out an anaerobic microcosm experiment using diverse wetland soils to assess the feedback of wetland SOC decomposition to temperature change with and without considering DOC flux. Results and discussion The contribution of DOC flux to wetlands SOC decomposition at a low temperature was significantly (p< 0.05) higher than that at a high temperature.Q(10)values of wetland SOC decomposition rates were significantly (p< 0.05) overestimated, by an average of 8%, when DOC was not considered. However, this overestimation was not significant (p> 0.05) for low-SOC wetland soils. In addition, the overestimation for alkaline wetland soils was much higher than that of acid wetland soils, with a significantly (p< 0.01) positive correlation between the ratios ofQ(10)(gaseous C emissions) toQ(10)(SOC decomposition) and soil pH across all wetland soil samples. Conclusions Our finding suggested that the sensitivity of wetland SOC decomposition to temperature change might be overestimated if DOC flux is not considered, especially in alkaline or high-SOC soils. Thus, C-climate models should incorporate DOC flux when predicting wetland C loss in response to warming.

AB Globally, peatlands play an important role in the carbon (C) cycle. High water level is a key factor in maintaining C storage in peatlands, but water levels are vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. This review examines literature related to the effects of water level alteration on C cycling in peatlands to summarize new ideas and uncertainties emerging in this field. Peatland ecosystems maintain their function by altering plant community structure to adapt to changing water levels. Regarding primary production, woody plants are more productive in unflooded, well-aerated conditions, whileSphagnummosses are more productive in wetter conditions. The responses of sedges to water level alteration are species-specific. While peat decomposition is faster in unflooded, well aerated conditions, increased plant production may counteract the C loss induced by increased ecosystem respiration (ER) for a period of time. In contrast, rising water table maintains anaerobic conditions and enhances the role of the peatland as a C sink. Nevertheless, changes in DOC flux during water level fluctuation is complicated and depends on the interactions of flooding with environment. Notably, vegetation also plays a role in C flux but particular species vary in their ability to sequester and transport C. Bog ecosystems have a greater resilience to water level alteration than fens, due to differences in biogeochemical responses to hydrology. The full understanding of the role of peatlands in global C cycling deserves much more study due to uncertainties of vegetation feedbacks, peat-water interactions, microbial mediation of vegetation, wildfire, and functional responses after hydrologic restoration.

AB There is concern that ecosystem services provided by blanket peatlands have come under threat due to increasing degradation. Blanket peatlands are subject to a wide range of drivers of degradation and are topographically variable. As a result, many degradation forms can develop, including those resulting from eroding artificial drainage, incising gullies and areas of bare peat. Many degraded blanket peatlands have undergone restoration measures since the turn of the century. However, there has been little formal communication of the techniques used and their success. Using practitioner knowledge and a review of the available literature, this paper discusses the methodologies used for restoring sloping blanket peatlands. It then considers current understanding of the impact of restoration on blanket peatland ecosystem services. There is a paucity of research investigating impacts of several common restoration techniques and much more is needed if informed management decisions are to be made and funding is to be appropriately spent. Where data are available we find that restoration is largely beneficial to many ecosystem services, with improvements being observed in water quality and ecology. However, the same restoration technique does not always result in the same outcomes in all locations. The difference in response is predominantly due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity inherent in all blanket peatlands. Peatland practitioners must take this variability into account when designing restoration strategies and monitoring impact. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A large portion of the global carbon pool is stored in peatlands, which are sensitive to a changing environment conditions. The hydrological loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is believed to play a key role in determining the carbon balance in peatlands. Zoige peatland, the largest peat store in China, is experiencing climatic warming and drying as well as experiencing severe artificial drainage. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we experimentally manipulated temperature and controlled the water tables in large mesocosms containing intact peat monoliths. Specifically, we determined the impact of warming and water table position on the hydrological loss of DOC, the exported amounts, concentrations and qualities of DOC, and the discharge volume in Zoige peatland. Our results revealed that of the water table position had a greater impact on DOC export than the warming treatment, which showed no interactive effects with the water table treatment. Both DOC concentration and discharge volume were significantly increased when water table drawdown, while only the DOC concentration was significantly promoted by warming treatment. Annual DOC export was increased by 69% and 102% when the water table, controlled at 0 cm, was experimentally lowered by -10 cm and -20 cm. Increases in colored and aromatic constituents of DOC (measured by Abs(254 nm), SUVA(254 nm), Abs(400 nm), and SUVA(400 nm)) were observed under the lower water tables and at the higher peat temperature. Our results provide an indication of the potential impacts of climatic change and anthropogenic drainage on the carbon cycle and/or water storage in a peatland and simultaneously imply the likelihood of potential damage to downstream ecosystems. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for local protection and sustainable development, as well as suggest that more research is required to better understand the impacts of climatic change and artificial disturbances on peatland degradation.

AB Iron (Fe) plays a key role in elemental cycling at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces by stabilizing carbon (C), phosphorus (P), and nutrient cations through physicochemical associations and by potentially releasing these elements following the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). However, the ecosystem-scale importance of Fe redox cycling and its responses to climate change remain unclear in precipitation-fed peatlands (bogs), C-rich wetlands with very low mineral content. We tested impacts of Fe redox cycling on C and nutrient release in two bogs in northern Minnesota and in Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE), an ecosystem-scale warming experiment. Concentrations of Fe(III) declined from the peat surface to 50 cm depth (31 to 0.5 mu mol g(-1)) and co-occurred with Fe(II) (10 to 30 mu mol g(-1)). Chemical reduction of Fe(III) released C and P from variably saturated (0-30 cm) peat (106-1006 mu mol C g(-1); 0.6-5 mu mol P g(-1)), and Fe-bound C was similar to previous measurements from upland mineral soils. Concentrations of Fe(II) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were strongly (R-2 = 0.56-0.78) and positively correlated in water samples measured at SPRUCE enclosure outlets and ambient near-surface porewater. Concentrations of Fe(II) also correlated positively with P at warmer SPRUCE temperature treatments and increased with experimental warming, but stabilized at the highest temperature treatments as water depth declined. Although bogs have low total mineral content, mass balance measurements indicated that atmospheric deposition could in principle sustain significant Fe cycling and hydrologic losses in these ecosystems. Overall, Fe redox cycling significantly impacted C and nutrient dynamics in these mineral-poor bogs, contributing to strong correlations between Fe(II) and DOC in water samples. Increased Fe(III) reduction with warmer temperatures will likely promote peatland C and nutrient release, impacting ecosystem C budgets both directly and indirectly by enhancing decomposition and productivity.

AB 1. The long-term carbon accumulation rate in a forested peatland in north-east Ontario was examined in relation to gas production and factors which control carbon transport.
   2 Plots of cumulative total mass and cumulative carbon mass against calibrated radio-carbon age estimates when applied to an existing model of peat accumulation, suggest that only very slow decay is occurring within the catotelm.
   3 Gas samples collected from depth shows that both carbon dioxide and methane are present. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analysis yields age estimates of both gases which are between 500 and 2000 years younger than conventional age estimates on adjacent peat. It is suggested that this is due to the downward transport of younger carbon, probably as part of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore waters.
   4 High tritium content of peat pore water at depth indicates the presence of water recharged during the last 40 years and therefore supports this hypothesis. Hydrological data from piezometers confirms the existence of hydraulic gradients for vertical water movement and shows that the direction of flow varies seasonally.
   5 The results indicate that the internal carbon dynamics of peatlands are more complex than has previously been thought and that hydrology may be an important factor in the supply of source carbon for anaerobic decay.

AB Recent research indicates that accumulation and release of biogenic gas from northern peatlands may substantially affect future climate. Sudden release of free-phase gas bubbles into the atmosphere may preclude the conversion of methane to carbon dioxide in the uppermost oxic layer of the peat, resulting in greater contribution of methane to the atmosphere than is currently estimated. The hydrology of these peatlands also affects and is affected by this process, especially when gas is released suddenly and episodically. Indirect hydrological evidence indicates that ebullitive gas releases are relatively frequent in some peatlands and time-averaged rates may be significantly greater than diffusive releases. Estimates of free-phase gas contained in peat have ranged from 0 to nearly 20% of the peat volume. Abrupt changes in the volume of gas may alter hydraulic gradients and movement of water and solutes in peat, which in turn could alter composition and fluxes of the gas. Peat surfaces also move vertically and horizontally in response to accumulation and release of free-phase gas. Future research should address the distribution, temporal variability, and relative significance of ebullition in peatlands and the consequent hydrological responses to these gas-emission events.

AB The relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the acidification of soils and freshwaters by sulfate (SO42-) has been a topic of great debate over the last few decades. Most interest has focused on long-term acidification. Few have considered the influence of episodic drought-induced acidification in peatlands on DOC mobility, even through the increased acidity and ionic strength associated with the oxidation of reduced sulfur to SO42- are known to reduce DOC solubility. Reduced DOC concentrations during droughts have often been attributed to: (i) reduced hydrological export; (ii) physicochemical changes in the peat structure; or(iii) changes in the biological production and/or consumption of DOC. Our experimental drought simulations on peat cores showed that SO42- induced acidification reduced DOC concentrations during droughts, However, the relationships between SO42-/pH/ ionic strength and DOC were only apparent when the reductions in observed DOC were expressed as a fraction of the estimated DOC concentration in the absence of S 204, which were derived from soil depth, temperature, and watertable data. This analysis showed that a pH fall from 4.3 to 3.5, due to a SO42- rise from < 2.5 to 35 mg L-1, caused a 60% reduction in DOC concentrations. In contrast, poor correlations were recorded between SO42-/pH/ionic strength and the observed DOC data. As DOC both influences acidity and is influenced by acidity, the relative change in DOC needed to be considered to disentangle the effect of inputs of mineral acids into a system naturally dominated by variable concentrations of organic acids.

AB Northern peatlands are important shallow freshwater aquifers and globally significant terrestrial carbon stores. Peatlands are complex, ecohydrological systems, commonly conceptualized as consisting of two layers, the acrotelm (upper layer) and the catotelm (lower layer). This diplotelmic model, originally posited as a hypothesis, is yet to be tested in a comprehensive manner. Despite this, the diplotelmic model is highly prevalent in the peatland literature, suggesting a general acceptance of the concept. We examine the diplotelmic model with respect to what we believe are three important research criteria: complexity, generality and flexibility. The diplotelmic model assumes that all ecological, hydrological and biogeochemical processes and structures can be explained by a single discrete boundary-depth in relation to a drought water table. This assumption makes the diplotelmic scheme inherently inflexible, in turn hindering its representation of a range of ecohydrological phenomena. We explore various alternative conceptual approaches that might offer greater flexibility, including the representation of horizontal spatial heterogeneity and transfers. We propose that the concept of hot spots, prevalent in terrestrial biogeochemistry literature, might be extended to peatland ecohydrology, providing a more flexible conceptual framework. Hot spots are areas of a peatland which exhibit fast processing rates in a number of mechanistically linked hydrological, ecological and biogeochemical processes. The complementary concept of cold spots may also be useful in peatland ecohydrology, particularly with regards to understanding the vulnerability of peatlands to disturbance. The flexibility of our suggested scheme may allow the future incorporation of ecohydrological phenomena yet to be identified as important in peatlands. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We used a relatively simple two-layer, coupled hydrology-biogeochemistry model to simultaneously simulate streamflow and stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in a small lead and arsenic contaminated upland peat catchment in northwestern Germany. The model procedure was informed by an initial data mining analysis, in combination with regression relationships of discharge, DOC, and element export. We assessed the internal model DOC processing based on stream DOC hysteresis patterns and 3-hourly time step groundwater level and soil DOC data for two consecutive summer periods in 2013 and 2014. The parsimonious model (i.e., few calibrated parameters) showed the importance of nonlinear and rapid near-surface runoff generation mechanisms that caused around 60% of simulated DOC load. The total load was high even though these pathways were only activated during storm events on average 30% of the monitoring time-as also shown by the experimental data. Overall, the drier period 2013 resulted in increased nonlinearity but exported less DOC (115 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) +/- 11 kgCha(-1) yr(-1)) compared to the equivalent but wetter period in 2014 (189 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) +/- 38 kgCha(-1) yr-1). The exceedance of a critical water table threshold (-10 cm) triggered a rapid near-surface runoff response with associated higher DOC transport connecting all available DOC pools and subsequent dilution. We conclude that the combination of detailed experimental work with relatively simple, coupled hydrology-biogeochemistry models not only allowed the model to be internally constrained but also provided important insight into how DOC and tightly coupled pollutants or trace elements are mobilized.
   Plain Language Summary Peat soils act as important carbon sinks, but they also release large amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the aquatic system. The DOC export is strongly tied to soluble heavy metals and other pollutants, which can pose a threat to human health. However, limited knowledge exists as to how much of these substances are mobilized, how they are mobilized in terms of flow pathways, and under which hydrometeorological conditions. In this regard, models can be useful and here we present a simple, conceptual model coupling the element export to hydrology. We could identify the nonlinear and rapid nature of the runoff generation mechanisms and their overwhelming influence on DOC (>60%) and element export in our small peat catchment. Furthermore, only, if all DOC pools were connected above a certain soil water level, such rapid near-surface flow paths developed. We concluded that simple models coupling the hydrology to biogeochemistry allowed to gain important insight into how DOC and tightly coupled heavy metals are mobilized in peat soil catchments.

AB Since 1988, there has been, on average, a 91% increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of UK lakes and streams in the Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN). Similar DOC increases have been observed in surface waters across much of Europe and North America. Much of the debate about the causes of rising DOC has, as in other studies relating to the carbon cycle, focused on factors related to climate change. Data from our peat-core experiments support an influence of climate on DOC, notably an increase in production with temperature under aerobic, and to a lesser extent anaerobic, conditions. However, we argue that climatic factors may not be the dominant drivers of DOC change. DOC solubility is suppressed by high soil water acidity and ionic strength, both of which have decreased as a result of declining sulphur deposition since the 1980s, augmented during the 1990s in the United Kingdom by a cyclical decline in sea-salt deposition. Our observational and experimental data demonstrate a clear, inverse and quantitatively important link between DOC and sulphate concentrations in soil solution. Statistical analysis of 11 AWMN lakes suggests that rising temperature, declining sulphur deposition and changing sea-salt loading can account for the majority of the observed DOC trend. This combination of evidence points to the changing chemical composition of atmospheric deposition, particularly the substantial reduction in anthropogenic sulphur emissions during the last 20 years, as a key cause of rising DOC. The implications of rising DOC export for the carbon cycle will be very different if linked primarily to decreasing acid deposition, rather than to changes in climate, suggesting that these systems may be recovering rather than destabilising.

AB The first dynamic model of dissolved organic Carbon (DOC) export in streams derived directly from high frequency (subhourly) observations sampled at a regular interval through contiguous storms is presented. The optimal model, identified using the recently developed RIVC algorithm, captured the rapid dynamics of DOC load from 15 min monitored rainfall with high simulation efficiencies and constrained uncertainty with a second-order (two-pathway) structure. Most of the DOC export in the four headwater basins studied was associated with the faster hydrometric pathway (also modeled in parallel), and was soon exhausted in the slower pathway. A delay in the DOC mobilization became apparent as the ambient temperatures increased. These features of the component pathways were quantified in the dynamic response characteristics (DRCs) identified by RIVC. The model and associated DRCs are intended as a foundation for a better understanding of storm-related DOC dynamics and predictability, given the increasing availability of subhourly DOC concentration data.

AB XAD fractionation has been widely used for isolating natural organic carbon into different fractions for disinfection by-product (DBP) formation tests. The widely used Amberlite((R)) XAD-8 resin is no longer commercially available and Supelite((TM)) DAX-8 resin has been substituted in recent research. The objective of this study was to evaluate the differences, in terms of reactivity in DBP formation, among the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fractions isolated by these two resins. DOC collected from two rivers and two soils in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Watershed was fractionated in parallel by the non-ionic macroporous DAX-8 and XAD-8 resins into hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions. Four parameters used to predict DBP formation in the water industry were evaluated: specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), differential ultraviolet absorbance at 272 nm (Delta UVA(272)), Specific trihalomethane formation (STHMFP) and specific haloacetic acid formation (SHAAFP). Results indicated that the sorption efficiency of DAX-8 resin was systematically greater than that of XAD-8 resin in our testing conditions and separated an average of 4% more humic substances. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions isolated by XAD-8 and DAX-8 resins showed no significant difference in DBP reactivity (p > 0.05), except for the hydrophilic fraction of the peat soil extracts. Our results indicated their comparability in general use for isolating DBP precursors from bulk aquatic humic substances. However, the fractions of soil humic substances, particularly organic-rich soil, isolated by these two resins may have different chemical characteristics.

AB Spatial and temporal variations in the composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream and soil water of the acidified Birkenes catchment were studied during summer and autumn 1990, Hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids were the dominant fractions in the soils (dominated by podzols and peats) and brook, accounting for approximately 90% of total DOC. The podzol displayed a vertical gradation of DOC fractions, with hydrophobic acids dominating in the O horizon (approximately 65%) and hydrophilic acids dominating in the E and B horizons (approximately 60%). In the bogs, hydrophilic acids were the dominant fraction at all depths. Temporal variations in the relative contributions of the various DOC fractions were most pronounced in the podzol O horizon and the brook during successive autumn rainstorms, and small in the mineral soils and bogs. In the brook, DOC increases at peak discharge were dominated by hydrophilic acids. If stream water was assumed to be a conservative mixture of water from the podzol O and B horizons and from the deeper layers in the bog surrounding the stream, 92% of the variability in the concentration of hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids in the stream could be explained. This mixing analysis suggested that base flow largely originated in the deeper layers of the bogs, while peak flow was primarily made up of B horizon (approximately 50-65%) and O horizon (approximately 35-50%) water.

AB Peatlands export significant amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to freshwaters, but the quantity of DOC reaching marine environments is typically less than the input to the fluvial system due to processing within the water column. Key removal processes include photo-chemical degradation, and heterotrophic bacterial respiration. In this study we examined these processes using C-14-labelled DOC to quantify the extent of DOC breakdown and to determine its fate following irradiation under controlled laboratory conditions. We examined the influence of microbial processes occurring within the water column, the potential role of stream-bed biofilms, and the possible modifying effects of downstream mixing, as DOC in water from the peatland encounters runoff from upland mineral soils ("Mountain"), nutrient-rich runoff from agricultural soils, and seawater in an estuary. Our results demonstrated conservative mixing of DOC from Peatland and Mountain waters but interactive effects when Peatland water was mixed with Agricultural and Estuary waters and exposed to solar radiation. The mixing of Peatland and Agricultural waters led to net DOC production, suggesting that DOC was only partially degraded by solar radiation and that the products of this might have fuelled autotrophic microbial growth in the samples. The mixing of Peatland water with saline estuary water resulted in net DOC loss following irradiation, suggesting a role for sunlight in enhancing the flocculation of DOC to particulate organic carbon (POC) in saline environments.

AB Much uncertainty still exists regarding the relative importance of organic acids in relation to acid deposition in controlling the acidity of soil and surface waters. This paper contributes to this debate by presenting analysis of seasonal variations in atmospheric deposition, soil solution and stream water chemistry for two UK headwater catchments with contrasting soils. Acid neutralising capacity (ANC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the Na:Cl ratio of soil and stream waters displayed strong seasonal patterns with little seasonal variation observed in soil water pH. These patterns, plus the strong relationships between ANC, Cl and DOC, suggest that cation exchange and seasonal changes in the production of DOC and seasaft deposition are driving a shift in the proportion of acidity attributable to strong acid anions, from atmospheric deposition, during winter to predominantly organic acids in summer.

AB Water-covered lands comprise approximately 30% of the total area of the world's boreal forest biome. Most of these lands are peatlands (i.e., bogs and fens), which store over half of the total carbon in the biome. Because climate warming threatens to alter the carbon stocks of peatlands, much attention has been devoted to understanding the climatic and hydrologic conditions that affect peatland biogeochemistry. However, there are other aquatic systems that are widespread in the boreal forest that also process and store carbon, including lakes and ponds. Although non-peatland aquatic systems cover a much smaller portion of the boreal landscape, they still contain approximately 15% of the total carbon pool for the biome, much of it stored as either profundal or littoral sediments. Further, the carbon dynamics of boreal lakes are dynamically coupled to watershed processes. Excepting major disturbances to boreal catchments, such as forest fires and forest harvest, surface waters are the only locations of net loss of carbon to the atmosphere. Our objectives are to review what is known about factors that affect lake ecosystem carbon dynamics in the boreal forest and to identify areas of study that we deem to be profitable for forecasting the impacts of climate change on carbon pools and flux rates. We primarily focus on the boreal forest of North America, but recognize that our findings may also be relevant for boreal areas of Fennoscandia and Russia. The following research priorities are identified: (i) estimation of carbon pools in profundal and littoral sediments across the boreal forest, (ii) warming experiments that include quantification of ecosystem carbon dynamics in addition to measuring changes to aquatic food web structure, (iii) whole system experiments to understand the hydrologic and biogeochemical conditions by which allochthonous carbon is integrated into aquatic food webs, especially in the context of increased nutrient concentrations associated with a warmer, and possibly drier, climate, as forecast for the southern boreal forest, (iv) watershed-scale assessment of carbon budgets for lakes that straddle transitional zones between the boreal forest and prairie-parkland, temperate forest or tundra, to detect evidence of ecosystem migration, and (v) integration of lacustrine carbon pools and flux rates into carbon budgets at scales that range from local watersheds to the boreal forest biome.

AB Palsa mires, nutrient poor permafrost peatlands common in subarctic regions, store a significant amount of carbon (C) and it has been hypothesized their net ecosystem C balance (NECB) is sensitive to climate change. Over two years we measured the NECB for Stordalen palsa mire and found it to accumulate 46 g C m(-2) yr(-1). While Stordalen NECB is comparable to nutrient poor peatlands without permafrost, the component fluxes differ considerably in magnitude. Specifically, Stordalen had both lower growing season CO2 uptake and wintertime CO2 losses, but importantly also low dissolved organic carbon exports and hydrocarbon (mainly methane) emissions. Restricted C losses from palsa mires are likely to have facilitated C accumulation of unproductive subarctic permafrost peatlands. Continued climate change and permafrost thaw is likely to amplify several component fluxes, with an uncertain overall effect on NECB - highlighting the necessity for projections of high-latitude C storage to consider all C fluxes.

AB We measured pH, cations, nutrients, and total organic carbon (TOC) over 3 years to examine weekly to monthly variability in porewater chemistry depth profiles (0-3.0 m) in an ombrotrophic bog in Minnesota, USA. We also compared temporal variation at one location to spatial variation in depth profiles at 16 locations across the bog. Most solutes exhibited large gradients with depth. pH increased by two units and calcium concentrations increased over 20 fold with depth, and may reflect peatland development from minerotrophic to ombrotrophic conditions. Ammonium concentrations increased almost 20 fold and TOC concentrations decreased by half with depth, and these patterns likely reflect mineralization of peat or decomposition of TOC. There was also considerable temporal variation in the porewater chemistry depth profiles. Ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus, and potassium showed greater temporal variation in near-surface porewater, while pH, calcium, and TOC varied more at depth. This variation demonstrates that deep peat porewater chemistry is not static. Lastly, temporal variation in solute chemistry depth profiles was greater than spatial variation in several instances, especially in shallow porewaters. Characterizing both temporal and spatial variability is necessary to ensure representative sampling in peatlands, especially when calculating solute pools and fluxes and parameterizing process-based models.

AB This study considers a detailed record of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) runoff from two small peat-covered catchments in the North of England in order to understand the whether DOC runoff is limited by its solubility or by its production. The study characterises each runoff event from the two catchments in terms of their: initial flow, pH, conductivity, DOC; humification ratio; and the changes in these variables over the event. The event analysis uses multiple and logistic regression approaches to show that: (i) runoff events showed both increases and decreases in DOC; and (ii) time between events was found to be significant in controlling DOC flux and/or concentration in both study catchments.
   The study implies that a dominant control on DOC concentration in runoff is the amount of flow through the peat soil. and that the rate of release is fast upon the time scale considered by this experiment (approximately <8 h). Diffusion is the limiting process on DOC in runoff for times up to 2 days. The rate of production of DOC only becomes important at time scales of more than this. (C) 2008 Pubtished by Elsevier B.V.

AB Conifer plantation forestry is recognised as a potential source of diffuse pollution to surface waters and represents a risk to their ecological status. In this study, the water chemistry and Chydoridae (Cladocera) communities of 26 small blanket bog lakes were investigated to assess the impact of plantation forestry. The study was conducted over a 12-month period in 2009-2010 by comparing lakes with three distinct catchment land uses: (i) unplanted blanket bog only present in the catchment, (ii) mature conifer plantation forests only present in the catchment and (iii) catchments containing mature conifer plantation forests with recently clearfelled areas. All three catchment land uses were replicated across two geologies: sandstone and granite. Lakes with afforested catchments had very high concentrations of plant nutrients (P and N), total dissolved organic carbon (TDOC) and heavy metals (Al and Fe), the highest concentrations being recorded from the clearfelled lakes. Similarly, the chydorid communities differed between lakes of contrasting catchment land use. The dominance of Alonopsis elongata in the unplanted blanket bog lakes shifted to dominance by the smaller bodied Chydorus sphaericus, along with Alonella nana, Alonella excisa and Alonella exigua, in the plantation forestry-effected lakes, consistent with a shift in lake trophy. Our findings have shown that plantation forestry can have a profound impact on the water quality of small peatland lakes, especially at the clearfell stage. The response of the chydorid communities is consistent with plantation forestry exerting a trophic, rather than an acidic or toxic, effect on lake ecosystems.

AB This study reconstructs a long-term record of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux release from an upland peat catchment in Northern England in order to construct a model of future DOC flux. A structural modelling approach is used to develop models for DOC production in the acrotelm in relation to changing temperature and water table depth. DOC production in the acrotelm is coupled with a description of release of reserves of carbon from the catotelm triggered by enzymic latch mechanisms. The model needs only three parameters to be successfully matched to the data, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of over 90% against the reconstructed catchment record. Model results suggests that the half-life of the effect of drought on the catchment is 11.2 years and that the majority of DOC production comes from the acrotelm/catotelm boundary. Using the calibrated model and predictions of future rainfall and temperature, it is forecast that DOC flux from this peat-covered catchment will increase to 25 tonnes C/km(2) by 2010 at a rate of 0.48-0.88 tonnes C/km(2)/year. These results imply a total DOC flux from UK rivers of 0.88-0.83 Mt C in 2002 and of the order of 1 Mt C by 2010. The implications for terrestrial carbon storage and water treatment are discussed.

The labile carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (HWC) in deep permafrost (280-350 cm) have been utilized during soil forming processes, with an increase of delta C-13(DOC) and delta C-13(HWC) values about 3 parts per thousand. The lower delta C-13 values showed that HWC was more easily available for microbial utilization. The delta C-13 values of TOC suggested that C-3 plants prevailed on the Eboling Mountain during the last 7000 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Large CO2 evasion to the atmosphere occurs as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is transported from soils to streams. While this physical process has been the focus of multiple studies, less is known about the underlying biogeochemical transformations that accompany this transfer of C from soils to streams. Here we used patterns in stream water and groundwater C-13-DIC values within three headwater catchments with contrasting land cover to identify the sources and processes regulating DIC during its transport. We found that although considerable CO2 evasion occurs as DIC is transported from soils to streams, there were also other processes affecting the DIC pool. Methane production and mixing of C sources, associated with different types and spatial distribution of peat-rich areas within each catchment, had a significant influence on the C-13-DIC values in both soils and streams. These processes represent an additional control on C-13-DIC values and the catchment-scale cycling of DIC across different northern landscape types. The results from this study demonstrate that the transport of DIC from soils to streams results in more than just rapid CO2 evasion to the atmosphere but also represents a channel of C transformation, which questions some of our current conceptualizations of C cycling at the landscape scale.
   Plain Language Summary Large carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere occurs as rainwater percolates through soils and into streams. This physical process is important for the global carbon cycle and has been the focus of multiple studies. However, less is known about the underlying processes that accompanies this transfer of carbon dioxide from soils to streams. Here we analyze the stable isotope composition of soil and stream carbon dioxide and demonstrate that methane production and mixing of carbon sources also occur in soils and streams. These processes were linked to different types and configurations of peat-rich areas, for example, bogs, fens, and riparian zones, found within each of the three studied catchments. Our results therefore demonstrate that the export of carbon dioxide from soils to streams not only results in emissions to the atmosphere but also represents a channel of transformation. This questions some of our current conceptualization of the catchment-scale cycling of carbon dioxide.

AB Peatland pools usually show a marked gradient regarding their minerotrophic (harder and less acidic waters) versus ombrotrophic (softer and more acidic waters) status, which appears to be crucial in structuring their planktonic food webs. In this study, we analyzed the effect of such habitat diversity in shaping bacterioplankton assemblages. The planktonic bacteria from five pools located in Rancho Hambre peat bog (Tierra del Fuego Island) were studied through morphological and cytometric approaches, over more than one seasonal cycle. The community was always dominated by small cocci with an average cell size of 0.27 x 0.36 mu m. Bacterioplankton morphological structure and cytometric fingerprint were correlated (Mantel test: P < 0.001), both methods used to characterize bacterioplankton showed significant differences between minero- and ombrotrophic pools. Variation in bacterial assemblage structure was mainly explained by abiotic variables relevant in peatlands such as pH, total hardness, conductivity, concentration of inorganic nutrients, and concentration and quality of dissolved organic carbon. Notably, these relatively fast approaches detected similar landscape-driven ecological patterns as previous high-throughput sequencing molecular studies of prokaryotes from the same pools, promising to be useful screening tools for limnological surveys as well as for monitoring the response of bacterial assemblages to environmental changes in peatland ecosystems.

AB Peat soils consist of poorly decomposed plant detritus, preserved by low decay rates, and deep peat deposits are globally significant stores in the carbon cycle. High water tables and low soil temperatures are commonly held to be the primary reasons for low peat decay rates. However, recent studies suggest a thermodynamic limit to peat decay, whereby the slow turnover of peat soil pore water may lead to high concentrations of phenols and dissolved inorganic carbon. In sufficient concentrations, these chemicals may slow or even halt microbial respiration, providing a negative feedback to peat decay. We document the analysis of a simple, one-dimensional theoretical model of peatland pore water residence time distributions (RTDs). The model suggests that broader, thicker peatlands may be more resilient to rapid decay caused by climate change because of slow pore water turnover in deep layers. Even shallow peat deposits may also be resilient to rapid decay if rainfall rates are low. However, the model suggests that even thick peatlands may be vulnerable to rapid decay under prolonged high rainfall rates, which may act to flush pore water with fresh rainwater. We also used the model to illustrate a particular limitation of the diplotelmic (i.e., acrotelm and catotelm) model of peatland structure. Model peatlands of contrasting hydraulic structure exhibited identical water tables but contrasting RTDs. These scenarios would be treated identically by diplotelmic models, although the thermodynamic limit suggests contrasting decay regimes. We therefore conclude that the diplotelmic model be discarded in favor of model schemes that consider continuous variation in peat properties and processes.

AB Peatlands support vital ecosystem services such as water regulation, specific habitat provisions and carbon storage. In Canada, anthropogenic disturbance from energy exploration has undermined the capacity of peatlands to support these vital ecosystem services, and thus presents the need for their reclamation to a functional ecosystem. As attempts are now being made to implement reclamation plans on post-mining oil sands landscapes, a major challenge remains in the absence of a standard framework for evaluating the functional state of a constructed peatland. To address this challenge, we present a functional-based approach that can guide the evaluation of constructed peatlands in the Alberta oil sands region. We achieved this by conducting a brief review, which synthesized the dominant processes of peatland functional development in natural analogues. Through the synthesis, we identified the interaction and feedback processes that underline various peatland ecosystem functions and their quantifiable variables. By exploring the mechanism of key ecosystem interactions, we highlighted the sensitivity of microbially mediated biogeochemical processes to a range of variability in other ecosystem functions, and thus the appropriateness of using them as functional indicators of ecosystem condition. Following the verification of this concept through current pilot fen reclamation projects, we advocate the need for further research towards modification to a more cost-efficient approach that can be applicable to large-scale fen reclamation projects in this region.

AB Peatlands contain a carbon stock of global concern and significantly contribute to the global methane burden. The impact of drought and rewetting on carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems is thus currently debated. We studied the impact of experimental drought and rewetting on intact monoliths from a temperate fen over a period of similar to 300 days, using a permanently wet treatment and two treatments undergoing drought for 50 days. In one of the mesocosms, vegetation had been removed. Net production of CH4 was calculated from mass balances in the peat and emission using static chamber measurements. Results were compared to C-13 isotope budgets of CO2 and CH4 and energy yields of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Drought retarded methane production after rewetting for days to weeks and promoted methanotrophic activity. Based on isotope and flux budgets, aerobic soil respiration contributed 32-96% in the wet treatment and 86-99% in the other treatments. Drying and rewetting did not shift methanogenic pathways according to delta C-13 ratios of CH4 and CO2. Although delta C-13 ratios indicated a prevalence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, free energies of this process were small and often positive on the horizon scale. This suggests that methane was produced very locally. Fresh plant-derived carbon input apparently supported respiration in the rhizosphere and sustained methanogenesis in the unsaturated zone, according to a C-13-CO2 labelling experiment. The study documents that drying and rewetting in a rich fen soil may have little effect on methanogenic pathways, but result in rapid shifts between methanogenesis and methanotrophy. Such shifts may be promoted by roots and soil heterogeneity, as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis occurred locally even when conditions were not conducive for this process in the bulk peat.

AB Boreal peatlands are major catchment sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrients and thus strongly regulate the landscape carbon balance, aquatic food webs, and downstream water quality. Climate change is likely to influence catchment solute yield directly through climatic controls on run-off generation, but also indirectly through altered disturbance regimes. In this study we monitored water chemistry from early spring until fall at the outlets of a 321 km(2) catchment that burned 3 years prior to the study and a 134 km(2) undisturbed catchment. Both catchments were located in the discontinuous permafrost zone of boreal western Canada and had similar to 60% peatland cover. The two catchments had strong similarities in the timing of DOC and nutrient yields, but a few differences were consistent with anticipated effects of wildfire based on peatland porewater analysis. The 4-week spring period, particularly the rising limb of the spring freshet, was crucial for accurate characterization of the seasonal solute yield from both catchments. The spring period was responsible for similar to 65% of the seasonal DOC and nitrogen and for similar to 85% of the phosphorous yield. The rising limb of the spring freshet was associated with high phosphorous concentrations and DOC of distinctly high aromaticity and molecular weight. Shifts in stream DOC concentrations and aromaticity outside the early spring period were consistent with shifts in relative streamflow con-tribution from precipitation-like water in the spring to mineral soil groundwater in the summer, with consistent relative contributions from organic soil porewater. Radiocarbon content (C-14) of DOC at the outlets was modern throughout May to September (fraction modern carbon, fM: 0.99-1.05) but likely reflected a mix of aged DOC, e.g. porewater DOC from permafrost (fM: 0.65-0.85) and non-permafrost peatlands (fM: 0.95-1.00), with modern bomb-influenced DOC, e.g. DOC leached from forest litter (fM: 1.05-1.10). The burned catchment had significantly increased total phosphorous (TP) yield and also had greater DOC yield during summer which was characterized by a greater contribution from aged DOC. Overall, however, our results suggest that DOC composition and yield from peatland-rich catchments in the discontinuous permafrost region likely is more sensitive to climate change through impacts on run-off generation rather than through altered fire regimes.

AB The Kwakshua Watersheds Observatory (KWO) is an integrative watersheds observatory on the coastal margin of a rain-dominated bog-forest landscape in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Established in 2013, the goal of the KWO is to understand and model the flux of terrestrial materials from land to sea - the origins, pathways, processes and ecosystem consequences - in the context of long-term environmental change. The KWO consists of seven gauged watersheds and a network of observation sites spanning from land to sea and along drainage gradients within catchments. Time-series datasets include year-round measurements of weather, soil hydrology, streamflow, aquatic biogeochemistry, microbial ecology and nearshore oceanographic conditions. Sensor measurements are recorded every 5 min and water samples are collected approximately monthly. Additional observations are made during high-flow conditions. We used remote sensing to map watershed terrain, drainage networks, soils and terrestrial ecosystems. The watersheds range in size from 3.2 to 12.8 km(2), with varying catchment characteristics that influence hydrological and biogeochemical responses. Despite local variation, the overall study area is a global hotspot for yields of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved iron at the coastal margin. This observatory helps fill an important gap in the global network of observatories, in terms of spatial location (central coast of BC), climate (temperate oceanic), hydrology (very high runoff, pluvial regime), geology (igneous intrusive, glacially scoured), vegetation (bog rainforest) and soils (large stores of organic carbon).

AB Abundant production of organic matter that decomposes slowly under anaerobic conditions can result in substantial accumulation of soil organic matter in wetlands. Tedious means for estimating production and decomposition of plant material, especially roots, hampers our understanding of organic matter dynamics in such systems. In this paper, I describe a study that amended typical estimates for both production and decomposition of organic matter by measuring net flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) over the peat surface within a conifer swamp, a sedge-dominated marsh, and a bog in the Appalachian Mountain region of West Virginia and western Maryland, USA. The sites are relatively productive, with net primary production (NPP) of 30 to 82.5 mol C m(-2) yr(-1), but pear deposits are shallow with an average depth of about 1 m. In summer, all three sites showed net CO2 flux from the atmosphere to the pear during the daytime (-20.0 to -30.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), supported by net photosynthesis, which was less than net CO2 flux from the peat into the atmosphere at nighttime (39.2 to 84.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), supported by ecosystem respiration. estimates suggests a net loss of carbon (C) from these ecosystems. The positive net CO2 flux seems to be so high because organic matter decomposition occurs throughout the pear deposit - and as a result concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) in peat pore waters reached 4,000 mu mol L(-1) by late November, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) in pear pore waters reached 12,000 mu mol L(-1). Comparing different approaches revealed several features of organic matter dynamics: (i) peat accretion in the top 30 cm of the peat deposit results in a C accumulation rate of about 15 mmol m(-2) d(-1); however, (ii) the entire pear deposit has a negative C balance losing about 20 mmol m(-2) d(-1).

AB Redox potentials (Eh) were monitored bimonthly and porewater chemistry was analyzed seasonally at three slightly-acidic, high-elevation Kentucky wetlands that differed in hydrology, parent materials, and vegetation. At all sites, Eh values were below 300 mV, which indicated that reducing conditions persisted within the upper 90 cm and fluctuated mainly within the range of iron and sulfate reduction. Significant relationships of Eh values with depth were observed only at the Martins Fork wetland, where precipitation was the primary water source. The strongest and most stable reducing conditions, observed at the Kentenia site, reflected consistently high water levels, which were sustained by ground water. The third wetland (Four Level) was distinguished by irregular Eh fluctuations coinciding with strong seasonal ground-water upwelling. Although Fe3+ and SO4 (2-) were the primary terminal electron acceptors in all wetlands, porewater chemistry also varied significantly by season and soil depth in response to piezometric water level fluctuations. Additional factors that influenced porewater chemistry included: (1) the presence of limestone parent materials that affected porewater pH, Ca2+, and Mg2+; and (2) the prevalence of sphagnum moss or graminoid species that influenced dissolved organic carbon, CO2, and CH4. Results from this study indicated the diverse range and importance of multiple factors in controlling biogeochemical processes and properties in small, high-elevation Appalachian wetlands.

AB The variation in species composition of trees greater-than-or-equal-to 7.6 cm gbh in thirty-eight plots (mostly c. 0.2 ha in extent) from physiognomically-defined kerangas forest were re-analyzed by principal components analysis ordination (species centering and standardization by sample norm). Analyses were performed separately on basal area abundances, on the densities of trees in three size classes (greater-than-or-equal-to 7.6, greater-than-or-equal-to 30.5 and greater-than-or-equal-to 61.0 cm gbh) and on the density of small and large trees (7.6- < 30.5 and 30.5- < 61.0 cm gbh). A total of 636 taxa were reduced to 381 for analysis, removing those of very low density and plot frequency.
   Three groups of plots were identified: forest at low elevation, and generally coastal, on deep humus podzols; forest at intermediate elevation on mostly red-yellow podzols with affinities to dipterocarp forest; and forest at high elevation on mostly peaty podzols. The first group was divisible into five subgroups along a drainage gradient, while the more poorly drained plots showing affinities to peat-swamp forest. Forty to eighty of the taxa, depending on the criteria for selection, were sufficient to define a stable, reduced spatial structure of the data matrix. Two subgroups, both coastal on deep podzols, represent the extreme form of kerangas forest per se. A comparison of Agathis borneensis- and Shorea albida-dominated plots revealed few other associated and differentiating taxa.
   Patterns were clearest from analyses of basal area data and of densities of all and small trees. Ordinations and grouping of plots for small, but not large, tree densities were similar to those for basal area. Different species were differentiated on the basis of the abundance measure, leading to group (tabular) definition of associations in a dual manner. A new system of summarization is presented which combines basal area, density and frequency in a graded hierarchical approach.
   The association between vegetation and soil type was difficult to unravel because of the limited environmental space sampled. Soil type was confounded with elevation, rainfall and geographical location. A major factor is clay content probably affecting nutrient status and water holding properties. 'Modal analysis' of small tree densities showed clearest patterns in this respect. There were no patterns at the family or genus level, nor in leaf size spectra within kerangas.
   Problems in the treatment, analysis and summarization of tropical forest data sets are discussed. These problems centre on the scale and intensity of field sampling and the advantages of measuring small trees leading to a dual basal area and density approach. All published studies, including this one, within kerangas forest have used inadequate sampling for the purposes of revealing species changes with respect to soil type and composition.

AB At the Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada, DOC export measured at the basin outflow was -8.3 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1), and DOC loading via precipitation was estimated to be 1.5 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Discharge and DOC export calculated using a Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation compared weil (within 1 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) to outflow estimates of DOC export. and confirmed that outflow measurements were a suitable proxy for DOC seepage at the peatland margins. DOC export was 12% of the magnitude of the residual carbon sink measured at the peatland. The [DOC] across groundwater transects decreased with depth, and [DOC] sampled below 0.75 m depths remained fairly constant over the study period. However, [DOC] exported through the acrotelm (0 to 0.45 m peat depth) was variable, ranging from 40 mg l(-1) after snowmelt to 70 mg l(-1) during the growing season. Fluorescence analysis revealed that exported DOC was 'allochthonous-like', whereas DOC in the catotelm (deeper layers of peat) became more 'autochthonous-like' with depth. A conceptual model is developed to summarize the hydrological processes and controls which affect DOC biogeochemistry at the Mer Bleue. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems contribute almost equally to the sequestration of ca 50 per cent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and already play a role in minimizing our impact on Earth's climate. On land, the majority of the sequestered carbon enters soil carbon stores. Almost one-third of that soil carbon can be found in peatlands, an area covering just 2-3% of the Earth's landmass. Peatlands are thus well established as powerful agents of carbon capture and storage; the preservation of archaeological artefacts, such as ancient bog bodies, further attest to their exceptional preservative properties. Peatlands have higher carbon storage densities per unit ecosystem area than either the oceans or dry terrestrial systems. However, despite attempts over a number of years at enhancing carbon capture in the oceans or in land-based afforestation schemes, no attempt has yet been made to optimize peatland carbon storage capacity or even to harness peatlands to store externally captured carbon. Recent studies suggest that peatland carbon sequestration is due to the inhibitory effects of phenolic compounds that create an 'enzymic latch' on decomposition. Here, we propose to harness that mechanism in a series of peatland geoengineering strategies whereby molecular, biogeochemical, agronomical and afforestation approaches increase carbon capture and long-term sequestration in peat-forming terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Peatlands perform important ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage and nutrient retention, which are affected, among other factors, by vegetation and peat decomposition. The availability of silicon (Si) in peatlands differs strongly, ranging from <1 to >25 mg L-1. Since decomposition of organic material was recently shown to be accelerated by Si, the aim of this study was to examine how Si influences decomposition of carbon and nutrient and toxicant mobilization in peatlands. We selected a fen site in Northern Bavaria with naturally bioavailable Si pore water concentrations of 5 mg/L and conducted a Si addition experiment. At a fourfold higher Si availability, dissolved organic carbon, carbon dioxide, and methane concentrations increased significantly. Furthermore, dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, manganese, cobalt, zinc, and arsenic concentrations were significantly higher under high Si availability. This enhanced mobilization may result from Si competing for binding sites but also from stronger reducing conditions, caused by accelerated respiration. The stronger reducing conditions also increased reduction of arsenate to arsenite and thus the mobility of this toxicant. Hence, higher Si availability is suggested to decrease carbon storage and increase nutrient and toxicant mobility in peatland ecosystems.

AB This study uses the extensive monitoring datasets of the Environment Agency of England and Wales to calculate the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC); particulate organic carbon (POC); and excess dissolved CO2 through English and Welsh rivers. The innovation of this study's approach is to account for the losses of carbon within the fluvial system as well as fluxes at the catchment outlet. In order to make this assessment this study considers: the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) as a measure of the degradation of DOC; and the dissolved CO2 concentration of groundwater as calculated and apportioned into surface waters on the basis of Ca concentrations. The study shows that the best estimate of carbon export, via rivers, from England and Wales is 10.34 Mg C/km(2)/year, with 4.19 Mg C/km(2)/year of this going to the atmosphere. The mapping of the carbon export shows that there are regional hotspots of carbon export and in a small number of cases rivers could be net sinks of carbon due to their low dissolved CO2 content relative to the atmosphere. The flux calculated by this approach is probably still an underestimate of the carbon flux through fluvial systems but the scale of the export is greater than that previously reported and there is evidence that the fluvial flux of carbon is increasing on a decadal scale.

AB Northern mires (fens and bogs) have significant climate feedbacks and contribute to biodiversity, providing habitats to specialized biota. Many studies have found drying and degradation of bogs in response to climate change, while northern fens have received less attention. Rich fens are particularly important to biodiversity, but subject to global climate change, fen ecosystems may change via direct response of vegetation or indirectly by hydrological changes. With repeated sampling over the past 20 years, we aim to reveal trends in hydrology and vegetation in a pristine boreal fen with gradient from rich to poor fen and bog vegetation. We resampled 203 semi-permanent plots and compared water-table depth (WTD), pH, concentrations of mineral elements, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), plant species occurrences, community structure, and vegetation types between 1998 and 2018. In the study area, the annual mean temperature rose by 1.0 degrees C and precipitation by 46 mm, in 20-year periods prior to sampling occasions. We found that wet fen vegetation decreased, while bog and poor fen vegetation increased significantly. This reflected a trend of increasing abundance of common, generalist hummock species at the expense of fen specialist species. Changes were the most pronounced in high pH plots, where Sphagnum mosses had significantly increased in plot frequency, cover, and species richness. Changes of water chemistry were mainly insignificant in concentration levels and spatial patterns. Although indications toward drier conditions were found in vegetation, WTD had not consistently increased, instead, our results revealed complex dynamics of WTD as depending on vegetation changes. Overall, we found significant trend in vegetation, conforming to common succession pattern from rich to poor fen and bog vegetation. Our results suggest that responses intrinsic to vegetation, such as increased productivity or altered species interactions, may be more significant than indirect effects via local hydrology to the ecosystem response to climate warming.

AB This study analysed the chemistry of water samples collected from mires in the south-eastern part of Western Siberia. The aim was to determine spatial and temporal patterns in the hydrochemistry of mires in relation to the environmental conditions and geological history of the region. The results show that concentrations of Fe-total, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and HCO3 ions are higher than those obtained in other regions of Russia and Europe, which is consistent with the geological conditions of Western Siberia. High Fetotal concentrations are associated with the distribution of sedimentary ore in the region's largest iron ore basin, the Bakchar deposit, which is represented by strata of various Cretaceous sedimentsary rock at depths of 150200 m. The Fe-rich rocks contribute to the high Fe concentrations in deep groundwater that feeds into the fens. The increase in Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl-, and HCO3 in the water resulted from a xerothermic period that occurred in the southern part of Western Siberia (45002500 years ago) that increased the carbonation and salinity of the rocks. A feature characteristic of the hydrochemical regime in raised bogs is the transformation of the chemical composition during the year, with a change in dominant anions from HCO3 to Cl- or SO42-. The water in transitional mires and rich fens were characterised by the predominance of HCO3 and Ca2+. Studies have shown that the size and stage of development play leading roles in the formation of the water chemistry in the mires. Small bogs and transitional mires were characterised by a rich mineral nutrition; while, the chemical composition of fens was mainly determined by their geomorphologic position and proximity to large river systems. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the functions of peatland ecosystems in Western Siberia and improve water sampling strategies for future research.

AB In lakes and rivers, the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are closely related. We analysed three large spectrophotometer data sets of Finnish inland waters from the years 1913-1914, 1913-1931 and 2014 for long-term changes in optical properties. The first data set consists of absorption spectra in the band 467-709 nm of 212 filtered water samples, the second one contains 1119 years of data for seven rivers, and the third one contains 153 sites with high resolution spectra over the band 200-750 nm. These data sets were supplemented with more recent monitoring data of DOC. The sites represent typical optical inland water types of north-eastern Europe. The results did not show any consistent large-scale changes in CDOM concentrations over the 101-year time period. The statistics of the absorption coefficients in 1913 and 2014 were almost identical, at 467 nm they were 1.9 +/- 1.0 m(-1) in 1913 and 1.7 +/- 1.2 m(-1) in 2014, and the shape of the CDOM absorption spectrum was unchanged, proportional to exp(-S.lambda), S = 0.011 nm(-1) and. is wavelength. Catchment properties, primarily lake and peat-land percentages, explained 50% of the variation of CDOM concentration in the lakes, and hydrological conditions explained 50% of the variation of CDOM in the rivers. Both illustrate the importance of catchments and hydrology to CDOM concentrations of boreal inland waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Temperature sensitivities of microbial respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production were investigated by using a novel method, thermal gradient (2-20A degrees C) temperature bar, in two typical peatlands (bog and fen) in North Wales, UK over 12 months. The study indicated that temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon decomposition in North peatlands was regulated not only by temperature but soil water content, dry-rewet event and phenologies. Potential decreases of Q(10) (CO2) with increasing soil temperature were confirmed in both peatlands, but Q(10) (DOC) increase with increasing soil temperature in both bog and fen sites. These results imply, if other factors such as the so-called CO2 fertilization effect are simultaneously taken into account, that the feedback of global warming induced CO2 release from peatlands to climate change may be overestimated in current biogeochemical models. However, global warming might have been nonlinearly accelerating DOC thermal production, and therefore it helps explaining the causes of remarkable increase of DOC in surface water in the Northern Hemisphere during last several decades.

AB The fluorogenic model substrates, methylumbelliferyl [MUF]-beta-D-glucoside, MUF-phosphate and MUF-sulphate, were used to investigate the activities of beta-glucosidase, phosphatase and sulphatase, respectively, in Welsh peatland soils. The method was used to investigate depth dependent variations in enzyme activity in a riparian wetland, and flush channel wetland. The highest activities were found at depths of less than 10 cm, thus confirming other studies which suggest this upper depth to be the site of greatest microbial activity. The most serious limitation to the technique was found to be the (fluorescence) quenching effects of the phenolic materials that dominate peatland dissolved organic carbon. The problem necessitates the adoption of a time consuming quench correction procedure with every sample. Fluorogenic substrates have led to a greater understanding of the role of enzymes in other aquatic systems. It seems likely that they will prove of equal value in elucidating their role in nutrient cycling and the biogeochemistry of peatlands.

AB Climate warming and vegetation composition change are expected to influence greenhouse gas emissions from boreal peatlands. However, the interactive effects of warming and different vegetation compositions on N2O dynamics are poorly known, although N2O is a very potent greenhouse gas. In this study, manipulated warming and vegetation composition change were conducted in a boreal peatland to investigate the effects on N2O fluxes during the growing seasons in 2015 and 2016. We did not find a significant effect of warming treatment and combination treatments of warming and vegetation composition change on N2O fluxes. However, sedge removal treatment significantly increased N2O emissions by three-fold. Compared with the treatment of shrub and sedge removal, the combined treatment of warming and shrub and sedge removal significantly increased N2O consumption by five-fold. Similar to N2O fluxes, the cumulative N2O flux increased by similar to 3.5 times under sedge removal treatment, but this effect was not significant. In addition, the results showed that total soil nitrogen was the main control for N2O fluxes under combinative treatments of warming and sedge/shrub removal, while soil temperature and dissolved organic carbon were the main controls for N2O release under warming combined with the removal of all vascular plants. Our results indicate that boreal peatlands have a negligible effect on N2O fluxes in the short-term under climate change, and environmental controls on N2O fluxes become increasingly important under the condition of warming and vegetation composition change.

AB The annual balance of CO2 was measured on a subarctic flark fen located in northern Finland (69degrees08'N, 27degrees17'E). Measurements were conducted using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method during the period from April 1998 to April 1999. Special emphasis was put on the importance of the wintertime CO2 balance as a component of the annual budget. The CO2 fluxes observed during the winter were relatively small (0.0055 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), but due to the long duration of the snow cover period, they play an important role in the annual balance of CO2. The efflux during the coldest periods, when soil surface temperatures fell below -10degreesC, was enabled by markedly higher peat temperatures (close to 0degreesC) in deeper layers. The typical nighttime respiration observed in summer was -0.10 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). The net photosynthesis had a typical daytime peak value of about -0.20 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in July. Corresponding with the instantaneous CO2 fluxes, the highest daily sink balances of about -9 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) were observed in July, while the highest daily respiration balances of about 2.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) were observed before and after the sink period. The CO2 balance for the winter period (105 g CO2 m(-2)) was greater than the absolute value of the total annual balance (-68 g CO2 m(-2)), which shows the importance of the wintertime efflux. After taking into account estimates for CH4 efflux and carbon leaching, an annual carbon balance of -7+/-5 g C m(-2) was obtained for the fen.

AB Quantifying the sink strength of northern hemisphere peatlands requires measurements or realistic estimates of all major C flux terms. Whilst assessments of the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) routinely include annual measurements of net ecosystem exchange and lateral fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), they rarely include estimates of evasion (degassing) of CO2 and CH4 from the water surface to the atmosphere, despite supersaturation being a consistent feature of peatland streams. Instantaneous gas exchange measurements from temperate UK peatland streams suggest that the CO2 evasion fluxes scaled to the whole catchment are a significant component of the aquatic C flux (23.3 +/- A 6.9 g C m(-2) catchment y(-1)) and comparable in magnitude to the downstream DOC flux (29.1 +/- A 12.9 g C m(-2) catchment y(-1)). Inclusion of the evasion flux term in the NECB would be justified if evaded CO2 and CH4 were isotopically "young" and derived from a "within-ecosystem" source, such as peat or in-stream processing of DOC. Derivation from "old" biogenic or geogenic sources would indicate a separate origin and age of C fixation, disconnected from the ecosystem accumulation rate that the NECB definition implies. Dual isotope analysis (delta C-13 and C-14) of evasion CO2 and DOC strongly suggest that the source and age of both are different and that evasion CO2 is largely derived from allochthonous (non-stream) sources. Whilst evasion is an important flux term relative to the other components of the NECB, isotopic data suggest that its source and age are peatland-specific. Evidence suggests that a component of the CO2-C evading from stream surfaces was originally fixed from the atmosphere at a significantly earlier time (pre-AD1955) than modern (post-AD1955) C fixation by photosynthesis.

AB The changes in the amounts and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) following long-term peat restoration are unknown, although this fraction of soil organic matter affects many processes in such ecosystems. We addressed this lack of knowledge by investigating a peatland in south-west Germany that was partly rewetted 20 years ago. A successfully restored site and a moderately drained site were compared, where the mean groundwater levels were close to the soil surface and around 30 cm below surface, respectively. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at 4 depths were measured over one year. The specific absorbance was measured at 280 nm and the fluorescence spectra were used to describe the aromaticity, and complexity of DOM.
   The investigations showed that 20 years of peatland restoration was able to create typical peatland conditions. The rewetted site had significantly lower DOC concentrations at different depths compared to the drained site. The specific UV absorbance showed that the rewetted site had a lower level of aromatic DOM structures. The decreasing specific UV absorbance might indicate an increasing contribution of small organic molecules to DOM. It was hypothesized that the decreasing DOC concentrations and the relative enrichment of small, readily degradable organic molecules. reflect the slower decomposition of organic matter after the re-establishment of the water table. Seasonal trends provided substantial evidence for our hypothesis that reduced DOC concentrations were caused by reduced peat decomposition. During summer, the elevated DOC values were accompanied by an increase in DOM aromaticity and complexity. Our results demonstrated a close link between C mineralization and DOC production. We concluded that long-term peatland restoration in the form of the successful re-establishment of the water table might result in reduced peat decomposition and lower DOC concentrations. The restoration of peatlands seems to have a positive impact on C sequestration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hummock-hollow microtopography is common in the northern peatlands of the world, but its effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) components are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated effects of microtopography on SOC stocks and soil labile organic carbon (LOC) fractions in a sedge peatland in Changbai Mountain in northeast China. We found that SOC and soil LOC fractions had much heterogeneity in microtopography. SOC concentration in hummocks was significantly higher than under hummocks and in hollows. On average, the total SOC stock to a depth of 0.3 m below the ground surface was 19.00 kg C/m(2). Fifty six percent of the total SOC stock was stored in soils in and under hummocks, despite the hummock only covering 30% of the total area. Light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in hummocks were significantly higher than under hummocks and in hollows. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified that SOC explained most variations in soil LOC fractions (59.6%), followed by soil total phosphorus (7.4%) and soil water content (6.6%). Our findings indicate that the hummock is an important carbon pool in the sedge peatland. Hummock-hollow microtopography creates heterogeneity in hydrological conditions and soil physicochemical properties, and thus influences SOC stocks and soil LOC fractions at a small scale. This study highlights the importance of microtopography in carbon storage and cycling and has direct implications for the assessment of the carbon sequestration function in northern peatlands.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in soil water samples collected from depths of 5 to 20 cm at 10 moorland and 11 forest sites during the period 2000-2006 were obtained from new measurements and from the monitoring programmes of the UK Environmental Change Network and the International Cooperative Programme (ICP) on Forests. Data on soil properties and vegetation type were also assembled. Considering data from Prenart tension collectors, which were used at nearly all the sites, mean annual concentrations ranged from 1.3 to 97.5 g m(-3) with means of 19.5 (standard deviation 15.2) and 27.6 (SD 23.3) g m(-3) for moorland and forest sites respectively. Interannual mean DOC concentration at an individual site varied by only 1.5-fold, averaged over all sites with at least three years' data. Concentrations during summer months (April to September) were on average 17% greater than those in winter (October to March). If data from two sites (the single peatland and an unusual forest site) were ignored, DOC concentrations were strongly inversely related to water flux, estimated from rainfall and evaporation data. Fluxes of DOC, calculated by combining concentration with water flux, ranged from 2.2 to 71.9 gC m(-2) yr(-1) over all sites and years, with overall means of 19.2 (SD 13.6) and 12.2 (SD 13.9) gC m(-2) yr(-1) for the moorland and forest sites respectively. However, if the two exceptional sites were omitted, the overall mean was 9.1 gC m(-2) yr(-1) with a standard deviation of only 4.9 gC m(-2) yr(-1). Annual DOC flux was strongly dependent upon annual water flux, varying by 3.5-fold between years when averaged over all sites. On average, 75.5% of the DOC was exported during the winter period (October to March). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate is an important driver of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in boreal catchments characterized by networks of streams within forest-wetland landscape mosaics. In this paper, we assess how climate change may affect stream DOC concentrations ([DOC]) and export from boreal forest streams with a multi-model ensemble approach. First, we apply an ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs) to project soil temperatures and stream-flows. These data are then used to drive two biogeochemical models of surface water DOC: (1) The Integrated Catchment model for Carbon (INCA-C), a detailed process-based model of DOC operating at the catchment scale, and (2) The Riparian Integration Model (RIM), a simple dynamic hillslope scale model of stream [DOC]. All RCMs project a consistent increase in temperature and precipitation as well as a shift in spring runoff peaks from May to April. However, they present a considerable range of possible future runoff conditions with an ensemble median increase of 31 % between current and future (2061-2090) conditions. Both biogeochemical models perform well in describing the dynamics of present-day stream [DOC] and fluxes, but disagree in their future projections. Here, we assess possible futures in three boreal catchments representative of forest, mire and mixed landscape elements. INCA-C projects a wider range of stream [DOC] due to its temperature sensitivity, whereas RIM gives consistently larger inter-annual variation and a wider range of exports due to its sensitivity to hydrological variations. The uncertainties associated with modeling complex processes that control future DOC dynamics in boreal and temperate catchments are still the main limitation to our understanding of DOC mechanisms under changing climate conditions. Novel, currently overlooked or unknown drivers may appear that will present new challenges to modelling DOC in the future.

AB Fate of the fungicide chlorothalonil (TClN) binding to dissolved organic acid fractions was quantified using gas-purge desorption studies. Binding studies were conducted to measure the dissolved organic carbon partition constant (K-DOC) with aquatic fulvic and humic acid fractions purified from cranberry bog water. Desorption studies at DOC concentrations up to 50 mg L(-1) resulted in mean log K-DCC values of 4.63 (s.d.=0.5, n=8) and 4.81 (s.d.=0.7, n=7) for fulvic and humic acids, respectively. These values deviated from reported K-OC (organic carbon) values by 0.5 to 1.5 orders of magnitude. The relationship between K-OC and K-DOC did not conform to accepted ratios of 10:1 to 3:1, although these studies were conducted with the strong hydrophobic fraction of DOC. Binding was rapid suggesting hydrophobic partitioning or weak Van Der Waals forces as binding mechanisms. The strong binding potential for TClN to aquatic humic substances corresponds to increased solubility in the aqueous system. Sorption to DOC suggests a possible transport mechanism which may result in elevated concentrations of TClN in cranberry bog systems.

AB The headwater streams originating in the Australian Alps are the highest water yielding landscape in South-Eastern Australia and are projected to be impacted by climate change through longer dry periods and more episodic rainfall. In this work we studied the major ion and DOC responses of three alpine peat lands (and the broader catchment containing these systems) to a high intensity (summer) storm event. Despite the high volume of rainfall, major ions in stream waters remained strongly chemostatic throughout the event. This was particularly the case for Ca2+ and Mg2+, as well as the alkalinity by association, and suggests that chemical regulation of these particular cations occurs through rapid equilibration processes. DOC concentrations increased during the storm pulse, leading to a shift in alkalinity partitioning from bicarbonate to organic anions and a decrease in pH, mediated by the CO2 saturation levels in the stream water. Our results suggest that alkalinity generation (Ca2+ and Mg2+ acquisition) and partitioning (DOC export) are decoupled processes that may respond differently to repeat storm events depending on the capacity of these systems to provide these constituents. Under extreme case scenarios depletion of DOC (at constant alkalinity) would lead to a smaller pH dip during a storm pulse, while depletion of alkalinity would lead to a larger pH dip, with buffering controlled by free acid. We have not identified the mechanism for the chemostasis of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (and therefore alkalinity) in this work, but this will be critical to understanding the capacity of these peatlands to respond to repeat and more intense storm events.

AB Peatlands are important to global carbon (C) sequestration and surface water acid-base status, both of which are affected by peatland alkalinity and acidity cycling. Relationships among sulfate (SO4 (2-)), nitrate (NO3 (-)), organic acids (OA(-)), base cations (i.e., Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+), proton (H+) acidity, and bicarbonate (HCO3 (-)) alkalinity were investigated in an intermediate fen peatland in northern Ontario during 2004 (an average precipitation year) and 2005 (a dry summer). Potential evapotranspiration was higher and the water table, groundwater input from the uplands, and runoff were lower during 2005. Net inputs of base cations, HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-), and OA(-), and to a lesser degree NO3 (-), were lower during the drier year, mainly due to lower groundwater transfer to the fen. Fen porewater HCO3 (-) concentration and net output were also lower in the drier year, whereas Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO4 (2-) concentrations and net output were higher. During the climatically average year, N immobilization, carbonic acid (H2CO3) dissociation, and OA dissociation were equally important H+-producing reactions. Peat cation exchange accounted for 50% of the H+ sink, while SO4 (2-) reduction and denitrification accounted for an additional 20 and 25% of the H+ sink, respectively. During the dry year, S oxidation accounted for 55% of the H+ net production, while that for H2CO3 dissociation was 70% lower than that during the climatically average year. Peat cation exchange consumed three times the acidity, and accounted for 92% of the H+ consumption during the dry year compared to the climatically average year. This was consistent with a three-fold higher net base cation export from the fen during the dry year. Based on the study results, a conceptual model was developed that describes the role of acidity formation and its implications to intermediate fen acidification.

AB The pour-through (PT) method is used in greenhouse and nursery production to monitor nutrient availability in soilless substrates. Efficacy of this method is based on the assumption that chemical properties of extracted solutions remain stable from the moment of collection until analysis. Extracted substrate solution can be analyzed directly in the greenhouse or sent to laboratories for complete nutritional analysis; thus, proper sample preservation methods (e.g., filtration and low temperatures) are critical for reducing sample contamination or degradation during storage. However, evidence of how these preservation methods affect chemical characteristics of PT samples is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of storage time, storage temperature, and filtration of PT samples on pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and nutrient concentrations from pine bark- and peat-based substrates. PT extracts were obtained from liquid-fertilized fallow pots of either 100% milled pine bark (Expt. 1) or a 4 sphagnum peat: 1 perlite (by volume) substrate (Expt. 2). Aliquots of PT extract were either filtered or nonfiltered and then stored in plastic bottles at 22, 4, or 20 degrees C. EC, pH, and nutrient concentrations were analyzed at 0, 1, 7, and 30 days after PT sample collection. EC and pH in PT extracts of peat and pine bark, respectively, changed 1 day after collection. Storage time had the greatest effect on nutrient concentrations of samples stored at 20 degrees C. However, at day 30, nutrient concentrations had also changed in samples stored at 4 and -22 degrees C. Analytes that fluctuated most in both experiments and across all preservation treatments were dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved nitrogen, NO3- -N, and PO43- - P, whereas Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42- -S were more stable in PT samples. This research suggests EC and pH should be analyzed immediately, whereas samples requiring nutrient analysis should be filtered immediately after collection, stored at 4 or - 22 degrees C (preferably -22 degrees C), and analyzed within 7 days of collection.

AB Predicting the effects of climate change and atmospheric deposition on water quality requires predicting the effects of landscape form on export of substances downstream. In this paper, we present dissolved organic carbon (DOG), total phosphorus (TP), and iron (Fe) export data (1980-1992) for 20 relatively undisturbed, forested catchments draining into seven lakes in central Ontario and develop regression models of chemical export as functions of landscape composition. The extent of wetlands was correlated with export of DOC and TP; the proportion of the catchment covered by peatlands accounted for 78% of the variance in a regression model of long-term average DOC export and 76% of the variance in a model of color ''export.'' Peatland coverage and Fe export together explained 76% of the variance in a long-term average TP export model, which is consistent with published experimental evidence that Fe facilitates P complexation with DOC in surface waters. The long-term average Fe export model was not significant when all 20 catchments were included. However, Fe export from the 14 catchments with thin tills was a function only of peatland coverage (R-2 = 0.71), suggesting that Fe export is dependent to a large extent upon either the export of organic material or the reducing conditions. The long-term export models worked well When export of a substance was dominated by peatlands but was not very sensitive to the influence of mineral soils. The long-term average TP/DOC ratio was remarkably constant among most whole-lake catchments, ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 mg P/g C, the exception being the catchment of anthropogenically acidified Plastic Lake with a ratio of 0.8. Fe export to Plastic lake was also enriched relative to TP export compared with the other lakes. Therefore TP export to Plastic Lake may be limited by some mechanism related to acidification.

AB Peatlands contain one-third of soil carbon (C), mostly buried in deep, saturated anoxic zones (catotelm). The response of catotelm C to climate forcing is uncertain, because prior experiments have focused on surface warming. We show that deep peat heating of a 2 m-thick peat column results in an exponential increase in CH4 emissions. However, this response is due solely to surface processes and not degradation of catotelm peat. Incubations show that only the top 20-30 cm of peat from experimental plots have higher CH4 production rates at elevated temperatures. Radiocarbon analyses demonstrate that CH4 and CO2 are produced primarily from decomposition of surface-derived modern photosynthate, not catotelm C. There are no differences in microbial abundances, dissolved organic matter concentrations or degradative enzyme activities among treatments. These results suggest that although surface peat will respond to increasing temperature, the large reservoir of catotelm C is stable under current anoxic conditions.

AB An on-line method has been developed for separating inorganic and organic bound uranium species present in river water samples. The method utilised a small chelating resin (Hyphan) column incorporated into the sample introduction manifold of an ICP-MS instrument. The method was evaluated for samples from rivers on Dartmoor (Devon, UK), an area of granite overlain with peat bogs. The results indicate that organic-uranium species form a major proportion (80%) of the total dissolved uranium present. Further work with synthetic water samples indicated that the level of dissolved organic carbon played a greater role in determining the level of organic-uranium species than did sample pH. Computer models for the water samples were constructed using the WHAM program (incorporating uranium data from the Nuclear Energy Agency Thermochemical Database project) in order to predict the levels of organic-uranium species that would form. By varying the proportion of humic and fulvic acids used in the humic component, predictions within 10% of the experimental results were obtained. The program did exhibit a low bias at higher pH values (7.5) and low organic carbon concentrations (0.5 mu g ml(-1)), but under the natural conditions prevalent in the Dartmoor water samples, the model predictions were successful.

AB Rotational vegetation burning in peatlands is undertaken predominantly to increase habitat suitability and food availability for red grouse Lagopus lagopus (Linnaeus). Red grouse shooting contributes to the upland economy and is seen as a traditional leisure activity. However, there is concern that burning can have detrimental effects on peatland terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. This study examined spatial and seasonal dynamics of stream physicochemistry and benthic macroinvertebrates from peatland sites that are managed via rotational vegetation burning and compared these with intact sites with no recent history of burning. Streams draining burned catchments were characterized by higher fine benthic particulate organic matter (FPOM), suspended sediment concentration (SSC), aluminium, iron and dissolved organic carbon than unburnt intact catchments. Anion concentrations were higher in intact catchments. There were significant differences in benthic macroinvertebrate richness, diversity and dominance, and community composition and functional feeding groups between burned and intact catchments, suggesting that land management had an effect on aquatic ecosystems. Higher SSC and FPOM in burned catchments were associated with lower abundance of some mayflies, stoneflies and caddis-flies and elevated abundance of some Diptera (Chironomidae and Simuliidae) larvae. Synthesis and applications. This study suggests that some aspects of peatland stream ecosystems are altered in catchments with rotational vegetation burning. Currently, there is much emphasis on the effects of rotational burning on peat carbon stores, but this study is the first to document the impacts on stream biota. Agencies with a remit covering upland freshwater ecosystem management might need to consider ways of reducing the extent of rotational vegetation burning to prevent effects on lotic ecosystems, and monitor whether macroinvertebrate assemblages subsequently shift back to a status similar to those in intact peatland streams. Fire occurs commonly on peatlands throughout the world, and our results suggest that trade-offs are needed to satisfy both economic and ecological facets of the combined socialecological systems in such areas, especially where fire is implemented as a management tool.

AB Geographic trends in Surface water chemistry and leaf tissue nutrients may reflect gradients of nutrient limitation and broad-scale anthropogenic inputs. In 24 rain-fed (ombrotrophic) peatland bogs in Massachusetts and Vermont, we measured nutrient and metal concentrations in pore-water and ill leaf tissues of three common bog plant genera - leather leaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), northern pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), and peat moss (Sphagnum spp.). The concentrations of N, P, and K were low in leaf tissues of all three plant genera, as were the concentrations of many trace heavy metals, including Cr, Cu, Co, Cd, Mo, and Pb. Stoichiometric ratios of macronutrients (N:P, P:K, and N:K) in plant leaves suggested that plant growth in the sampled bogs was limited by P, or was co-limited by all three macronutrients. N:P and N:K nutrient ratios of Sarracenia purpurea and Sphagnum spp, increased toward the northwest and with elevation, but stoichiometric ratios of Chamaedaphne calyculata did not show any clear geographic trends. A principal components analysis revealed additional distinct differences among the three plant genera in their nutrient and metal concentrations. Furthermore. dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), Cu, Mg, NO3, Al, and K in pore-water increased from the northwest (northwestern Vermont) to file southeast (Cape Cod and eastern Massachusetts near Boston), a gradient of increasing human Population density and urbanization. In contrast, pore-water concentrations of SO4 and Al were highest in the western sites, and SO4 concentrations increased with elevations. These patterns may reflect atmospheric inputs from the Ohio River Valley leading to increased acidic deposition, causing Al to be leached from soils. Because bogs are naturally low in nutrients and do not receive Substantial inputs from Surrounding groundwater, the chemical signatures and nutrient stoichiometry of specific bog plant species or genera may provide useful indicators for assessing spatiotemporal changes in atmospheric deposition.

AB The aim of this overview paper is to analyse the inclusion and use of the ecosystem services concept in scientific studies of degraded peatlands and peatland restoration. Publications indexed by the Institute of Science Information (ISI) Web of Science (WoS) from 1980 to October 2009 were analysed. Word combinations relevant to peatland ecosystem services in the title, keywords and abstract were used. We followed the division of ecosystem services into four categories: supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural, as provided by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). The analysis indicated that the concept of ecosystem services is not referred to explicitly in ISI WoS studies on peatland restoration. The interpretation of the content identified using search phrases related to various beneficial functions of peatlands showed that they mainly include information on regulating and supporting ecosystem services critical to sustaining vital ecosystem functions that deliver benefits to people. There are only a few articles addressing provisioning and cultural ecosystem services. One of the key issues concerning the effect of peatland restoration in the provisioning of ecosystem services is the balance of greenhouse gases and their role in global climate regulation.

AB Using high-frequency measurements of free water dissolved oxygen (O-2), we assessed gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), and net aquatic production (NAP) in the shallow-water Everglades peatland between 1996 and 2005. We distinguish NAP from net ecosystem production since the boundary for shallow aquatic ecosystems may include aboveground GPP of wetland biota. Metabolism was estimated for 68 sites distributed among nine habitats and yielded 1085 5-d deployments or 5425 site-days. Habitats differed in vegetation composition, trophic status, and hydrology. Systemwide O-2 averaged 3.8 +/- 2.2 mg L-1 (mean +/- SD), or 49% +/- 30% of atmospheric saturation. GPP, R, and NAP averaged 103 +/- 76, 220 +/- 79, and 2117 +/- 65 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Metabolism was greater during the summer-wet season when greater irradiance, temperature, and material flux stimulate primary production and decomposition. Paradoxically, GPP was inversely related to total phosphorus (TP), with oligotrophic (TP < 7 mg L-1) open-water habitats dominated by periphyton having the highest and eutrophic (TP > 35 mg L-1) habitats with dense emergent macrophytes the lowest rates. R was greatest for moderately enriched (TP = 15 mg L-1) open-water habitats with floating macrophytes. The prevalence of net heterotrophy, 96% of the 1085 NAP estimates, reveals the importance of aboveground biota in regulating aquatic metabolism and O-2 dynamics in shallow ecosystems. R is not only regulated by the influx of aboveground autochthonous carbon but also by aquatic GPP. Carbon turnover is greater in habitats where O-2 production by aquatic vegetation enables aerobic respiration. Conversely, water-column GPP is suppressed by dense emergent macrophytes, which limits O-2 availability, favors anaerobic respiration, and reduces carbon turnover.

AB Peatlands in Zoige Plateau contains more than half of peatland carbon stock in China. This part of carbon is losing with climate change through dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, both of which are vulnerable to the environmental changes, especially on the Zoige Plateau with a pace of twice the observed rate of global climate warming. This research aimed to understand how climate change including soil warming, rainfall reduction and water table change affect CO2 emissions and whether the trends of changes in CO2 emission are consistent with those of pore water DOC concentration. A mesocosm experiment was designed to investigate the CO2 emission and pore water DOC during the growing seasons of 2009-2010 under scenarios of passive soil warming, 20% rainfall reduction and changes to the water table levels. The results showed a positive relationship between CO2 emission and DOC concentration. For single factor effect, we found no significant relationship between water table and CO2 emission or DOC concentration. However, temperature at 5 cm depth was found to have positive linear relationship with CO2 emission and DOC concentration. The combined effect of soil warming and rainfall reduction increased CO2 emission by. 96.8%. It suggested that the drying and warming could stimulate potential emission of CO2. Extending this result to the entire peatland area in Zoige Plateau translates into 0.45 Tg CO2 emission per year over a growing season. These results suggested that the dryer and warmer Zoige Plateau will increase CO2 emission. We also found the contribution rate of DOC concentration to CO2 emission was increased by 12.1% in the surface layer and decreased by 13.8% in the subsurface layer with combined treatment of soil warming and rainfall reduction, which indicated that the warmer and dryer environmental conditions stimulate surface peat decomposition process.

AB The mobilisation of energy from allocthonous carbon by heterotrophic bacterioplankton can be proportionally more important than autotrophic production in humic lakes. Moreover, increasing levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in many aquatic systems linked to increases in precipitation, which in turn may be related to changing climate, mean that this heterotrophic component of the food web may play an increasing role in the overall transfer and production of energy, particularly within peatland catchments. While such catchments are common in the temperate northwest Atlantic regions of Europe, studies describing the seasonal dynamics of the heterotrophic, mixotrophic, and autotrophic components of their aquatic food webs are rare. In this study, the biomass of these pelagic components was enumerated over 1 year in 2 oligotrophic lakes, both situated in peatland catchments in the west of Ireland but with contrasting DOC concentrations. Bacterial biomass dominated the pelagic food web of the more humic lake, Lough Feeagh, while autotrophic phytoplankton biomass was greatest in the clearwater lake, Lough Guitane. The biomass of potentially mixotrophic flagellates was also slightly larger in the Lough Guitane, while phagotrophic ciliate biomass was comparable between the 2 lakes. An extreme precipitation event led to a significant increase in bacterial biomass while simultaneously depressing autotrophic production for several months in the humic lake. Extreme precipitation in the clearwater lake also depressed autotrophic production but did not give rise to significant increases in bacterial biomass. This quantification of autotrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic components provides a vital first step in understanding how pelagic communities contribute to net ecosystem productivity, and thus how Irish peatland lakes may be affected by projected climate changes.

AB The role of algae in the metabolism of northern peatlands is largely unknown, as is how algae will respond to the rapid climate change being experienced in this region. In this study, we examined patterns in algal productivity, nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during an uncharacteristically wet summer in an Alaskan rich fen. Our sampling was conducted in three large-scale experimental plots where water table position had been manipulated (including both drying and wetting plots and a control) for the previous 4 years. This study allowed us to explore how much ecosystem memory of the antecedent water table manipulations governed algal responses to natural flooding. Despite no differences in water table position between the manipulated plots at the time of sampling, algal primary productivity was consistently higher in the lowered water table plot compared to the control or raised water table plots. In all plots, algal productivity peaked immediately following seasonal maxima in nutrient concentrations. We found a positive relationship between algal productivity and water-column DOC concentrations (r (2) = 0.85, P < 0.001). Using these data, we estimate that algae released approximately 19% of fixed carbon into the water column. Algal exudates were extremely labile in biodegradability assays, decreasing by more than 55% within the first 24 h of incubation. We suggest that algae can be an important component of the photosynthetic community in boreal peatlands and may become increasingly important for energy flow in a more variable climate with more intense droughts and flooding.

AB We studied the effect of a calcite (CaCO3) treatment on peat and pore water chemistry in poor fen and conifer swamp wetlands next to Woods Lake and its tributaries to evaluate the role of wetlands in an Experimental Watershed Liming Study (EWLS). Feat was characteristically organic rich and nutrient poor, with exchangeable Ca concentrations of <13 cmol(c)kg(-1) We estimated that between 0.4 to 4 Mg CaCO3 ha(-1) fell directly on three study sites; however, one year after the treatment the increase in Ca concentration (0-8 cm depth) was equivalent to a CaCO3 dosage of 3 Mg ha(-1) with an additional 2-4 Mg ha(-1) of undissolved CaCO3 still present, suggesting the pear retained Ca supplied from uplands. Most aspects of peat chemistry including microbial respiration and SO4 reduction did not respond to the treatment.
   Peat pore water (5 and 20 cm depths) had a mean pH of 4.82 before treatment with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOG mean of 790 mu mol C/l) and low Ca2+ concentration (mean of 32 mu mol/l). The CaCO3 treatment increased concentrations of Ca2+ to a mean of 87 mu mol/l and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) from 205 to a mean of 411 mu mol/l, whereas it decreased monomeric Al concentration from 19 to 10 mu mol/l. Otherwise, pore water chemistry showed little response to the treatment, at least within natural spatial and temporal variation of solute concentrations. The results suggest that liming watersheds with the relatively low CaCO3 dosage applied in this study can benefit acidic waters downstream by exporting more Ca and DIC and less monomeric Al, with otherwise little effect on the pear itself.

AB Seawater circulation in permeable coastal sediments is driven by tidal changes in hydraulic gradients. The resulting submarine groundwater discharge is a source of nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the water column. Yet, little is known about the cycling of DOM within tidal sediments, because the molecular DOM characterization remains analytically challenging. One technique that can dissect the multitude of molecules in DOM is ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). To aim at a high resolution DOM analysis we study the seasonal turnover and marine and terrestrial sources of DOM in an intertidal creek bank of the southern North Sea down to 3 m depth and link the biogeochemical processes to FT-ICR-MS data and the analyses of inorganic porewater chemistry, delta C-13 of solid-phase extracted dissolved organic carbon (SPE-DOC), dissolved black carbon (DBC) and dissolved carbohydrates (DCHO). Increasing concentrations of dissolved Fe, Mn, P, total alkalinity, dissolved nitrogen, DOC and a concomitant decrease of sulfate along the seawater circulation path from the upper tidal flat to the tidal flat margin indicate continuous microbial activity. The relative increase of Si concentrations, unsaturated aliphatics, peptide molecular formulae and isotopically more C-13-enriched SPE-DOC towards the tidal flat margin suggests that remineralization processes mobilize DOM from buried algal (diatoms) and microbial biomass. Porewater in sediments <100 cm depth contains C-13-depleted SPE-DOC and highly unsaturated compounds which are probably derived from eroded peats, suggesting rapid removal of bioavailable marine DOM such as DCHO from the water column and selective enrichment of terrestrial DOM. DBC concentrations are highest in the discharging porewater close to the tidal creek suggesting that the intertidal flat is an important DBC source to the coastal ocean. Porewater DOM accumulating at the low water line is enriched in N and S. We hypothesize that this is partly due to DOM reacting with dissolved sulfide and ammonium which may increase the refractory character of the DOM, hence making it less bioavailable for in situ active microbes.

AB Forested wetlands dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) are commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States. Global climate change and in particular sea level rise will alter the frequency and magnitude of wet/dry periods and salinity levels in these ecosystems. Soil microcosm experiments were set up to identify the effects of water level variations (0.4-3.0 g-water g-soil(-1)) and salinity changes (0, 1 and 5 ppt of NaCl) on greenhouse gas emissions (CH4, CO2, and N2O) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) characteristics from forested wetland soils. Our results indicate that, the effect of water level was much greater than salt intrusion on C and N cycling. Wet dry treatments significantly decreased DOC production and total CH4-C loss, aromatic and humic-like substance compounds in DOC were increased in both flooding and wet dry treatments after 60-d incubation. The molecular weight (MW) of DOC, as indicated by E2/E3 ratio and spectral slope, after flooding treatments was higher than that in wet dry treatments. A first order kinetic model showed there was a positive linear correlation (r(2) = 0.73) between CO2 emission rate and DOC concentration which indicated that CO2 was mainly generated from DOC. An exponential kinetic model was applied to describe the correlation between CH4 emission rate and DOC concentration (r(2) = 0.41). This study demonstrates that an increase in salinity, and in particular variations in wet dry cycles, will lead to changes in the formation of climate -relevant greenhouse gases, such as CH4, CO2, and N2O.

AB A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of organic matter content oil arsenic speciation and mobilization in chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-containinated soils. The study was performed with four synthetic CCA-contaminated soils, with a range of organic matter content (mixture of peat moss and poultry manure) varying between 0.5% and 15% (w/w), under unsaturated and aerobic conditions for 40 days. Changes in water-soluble arsenic speciation (As(V), As(III), MMAA, DMAA) were monitored over time in soil extracts by HPLC-ICP-MS and in the soil solid phase (As(III), As(V)) by a solvent extraction method. irrespective of organic matter content, As(V) was the predominant soil bound and aqueous phase arsenic species. However, over 40 days, a high soil organic matter content (7.5% and 15%) was able to entail formation of soil bound As(III). Moreover, total water-soluble arsenic was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (r(2) =0.88). However, the organic matter content did not influence arsenic speciation in the soluble fraction; neither As(V) reduction nor arsenic biomethylation occurred within 40 days. An increase in dissolved organic carbon content promoted both As(V) and As(III) solubilization in soils. Also, over time, organic matter contents of 7.5% and 15% entailed the persistence of soluble As(V), likely due to the high content of dissolved organic compounds which prevented its sorption onto soil. Based on this data, the environmental risk of aerobic CCA-contarninated soils rich in organic matter may be due to an enhanced availability of soluble As(V) over time, rather than to the formation of the more toxic and more mobile As(III).

AB The dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are closely related to organic matter processes such as decomposition, humification, and stabilization of organic matter in soils. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) have an equal response to these processes. We analyzed DOC and DON concentrations of topsoil, groundwater, and surface water of six differently used sites characterized by differences in peat degradation. Carbon (C-13, C-14) and nitrogen (N-15) isotopes of DOM were related to a humification index in order to detect differences between DOC and DON at different stages of humification. The results show that intact peatlands had higher DOC concentrations than degraded peatlands. Clearly, DOC concentration depends on soil organic carbon content and therefore on the degree of peat degradation. However, intact and degraded peatlands showed similar DON and inorganic N concentrations suggesting that DON release is dependent on soil inorganic N rather than the organic N pool. Moreover, a high degree of peat degradation resulted in lower DOC/DON ratios than the C/N ratio of the solid phase indicating a preferential release of DON from soil organic matter. Further, delta(13)C ratios and the radiocarbon age of DOM increase with peat degradation and humification indicating a high C turnover, an increased microbial modification and age of DOC. On the other hand delta(15)N ratios decrease, probably as a result of N fertilization. The promoting effect of inorganic N on DON release and a high humification of DOM at sites treated with inorganic N fertilizers suggest that N fertilization promotes a release of amino acids depleted in N-15 and subsequent condensation with carbohydrates to humic substances.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in upland surface waters in many northern hemisphere industrialised regions are at their highest in living memory, provoking debate over their "naturalness". Because of the implications for drinking water treatment and supply there is increasing interest in the potential for mitigation through local land management, and for forecasting the likely impact of environmental change. However, the dominant controls on DOC production remain unresolved, hindering the establishment of appropriate reference levels for specific locations. Here we demonstrate that spatial variation in long-term average DOC levels draining upland UK catchments is highly predictable using a simple multiple logistic regression model comprising variables representing wetland soil cover, rainfall, altitude, catchment sensitivity to acidification and current acid deposition. A negative relationship was observed between DOC concentration and altitude that, for catchments dominated by organo-mineral soils, is plausibly explained by the combined effects of changing net primary production and temperature-dependent decomposition. However, the magnitude of the altitude effect was considerably greater for catchments with a high proportion of wetland cover, suggesting that additional controls influence these sites such as impeded respiratory loss of carbon in wet soils and/or an increased susceptibility to water level drawdown at lower altitudes. The model suggests (1) that continuing reductions in sulphur deposition on acid sensitive organo-mineral soils, will drive further significant increases in DOC and, (2) given the differences in the magnitude of the observed altitude-DOC relationships, that DOC production from catchments with peat-dominated soils may be more sensitive to climate change than those dominated by mineral soils. However, given that mechanisms remain unclear, the latter warrants further investigation.

AB Soil carbon pools are an essential but poorly understood factor in heterotrophic soil respiration on forested landscapes. We hypothesized that the topographically regulated distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the dominant factor contributing to soil CO2 efflux. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring soil CO2 efflux and sampling particulate and dissolved substrates (both mobile DOC in soil solution and DOC potentially sorbed onto Fe and Al oxyhydroxides) in surface (freshly fallen leaves (FFL) and forest floor) and near-surface (A-horizon or top 10 cm of peat) soils along three hillslope transects (15A degrees, 25A degrees and 35A degrees slopes) that included upland (crest, shoulder, backslope, footslope, and toeslope) and wetland (periphery and central) topographic features during the snowfree season within a sugar maple forest. We observed that median snowfree season soil CO2 efflux ranged from < 1 to > 5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Substrates in the near-surface mineral soil were most strongly related to median soil CO2 efflux, and when combined mobile DOC and sorbed DOC together explained 78% of the heterogeneity in median soil CO2 efflux (p < 0.001). When the carbon pool in FFL (an important source of DOC to the forest soils) was included, the explanation of variance increased to 81% (p < 0.001). Topographically regulated processes created high concentrations of mobile DOC at the footslope, and high concentrations of sorbed DOC further downslope at the toeslope, forming distinct traps of DOC that can become hotspots for soil CO2 production. A reduction in the uncertainty of forest carbon budgets can be achieved by taking into consideration the topographic regulation of the substrates contributing to soil CO2 efflux.

AB Changes in hydrological conditions are expected and may alter carbon cycling in peatlands. Peat aeration with water table change has not commonly been investigated, and the water table is often assumed to constitute the oxic-anoxic boundary in peat. We analyzed temperature, moisture, oxygen (O-2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in profiles of a temperate fen during two seasons. A drying-rewetting cycle and flooding were induced and compared to controls. The response of moisture and water table position varied greatly and was related to gradients of peat compaction and ash content. Background drought raised air-filled porosity (AFP) to a maximum of 15%-38% in shallow peat and experimental drought up to 50%. Decline in water table and soil moisture broadly led to O-2 penetration and CO2 degassing, and rewetting and flooding led to anoxic conditions and CO2 accumulation in peat pore water. In dense peat with >= 20% ash content the unsaturated zone remained partly low in oxygen, however, and up to 5% AFP and 20 cm above water table O-2 concentrations frequently remained below 50 mu mol L-1. Moderately intense and short drying did not induce substantial oxygen penetration in the compacted soil profiles. The likelihood of the presence of oxygen in the peat was predicted by logistic regression using water table and ash content or bulk density as predictors (p < 0.0005). The model is potentially useful for predicting the position of the redoxcline in peat deposits and may assist in improving statistical models of trace gas emission from peatlands.

AB We used radiocarbon measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to resolve sources of riverine carbon within agriculturally dominated landscapes in California. During 2003 and 2004, average Delta(14)C for DOC was -254aEuro degrees in agricultural drains in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, -218aEuro degrees in the San Joaquin River, -175aEuro degrees in the California State Water Project and -152aEuro degrees in the Sacramento River. The age of bulk DOC transiting the rivers of California's Central Valley is the oldest reported for large rivers and suggests wide-spread loss of soil organic matter caused by agriculture and urbanization. Using DAX 8 adsorbent, we isolated and measured (14)C concentrations in hydrophobic acid fractions (HPOA); river samples showed evidence of bomb-pulse carbon with average Delta(14)C of 91 and 76aEuro degrees for the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers, respectively, with older HPOA, -204aEuro degrees, observed in agricultural drains. An operationally defined non-HPOA fraction of DOC was observed in the San Joaquin River with seasonally computed Delta(14)C values of between -275 and -687aEuro degrees; the source of this aged material was hypothesized to be physically protected organic-matter in high clay-content soils and agrochemicals (i.e., radiocarbon-dead material) applied to farmlands. Mixing models suggest that the Sacramento River contributes about 50% of the DOC load in the California State Water Project, and agricultural drains contribute approximately one-third of the load. In contrast to studies showing stabilization of soil carbon pools within one or two decades following land conversion, sustained loss of soil organic matter, occurring many decades after the initial agricultural-land conversion, was observed in California's Central Valley.

AB [1] Northern peatlands contain enormous quantities of organic carbon within a few meters of the atmosphere and play a significant role in the planetary carbon balance. We have developed a new, process-oriented model of the contemporary carbon balance of northern peatlands, the Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS). Components of PCARS are (1) vascular and nonvascular plant photosynthesis and respiration, net aboveground and belowground production, and litterfall; (2) aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of peat; (3) production, oxidation, and emission of methane; and (4) dissolved organic carbon loss with drainage water. PCARS has an hourly time step and requires air and soil temperatures, incoming radiation, water table depth, and horizontal drainage as drivers. Simulations predict a complete peatland C balance for one season to several years. A 3-year simulation was conducted for Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, and results were compared with multiyear eddy covariance tower CO(2) flux and ancillary measurements from the site. Seasonal patterns and the general magnitude of net ecosystem exchange of CO(2) were similar for PCARS and the tower data, though PCARS was generally biased toward net ecosystem respiration (i.e., carbon loss). Gross photosynthesis rates (calculated directly in PCARS, empirically inferred from tower data) were in good accord, so the discrepancy between model and measurement was likely related to autotrophic and/or heterotrophic respiration. Modeled and measured methane emission rates were quite low. PCARS has been designed to link with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) land surface model and a global climate model (GCM) to examine climate-peatland carbon feedbacks at regional scales in future analyses.

AB Permafrost thawing in peatlands has the potential to alter the catchment export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), thus influencing the carbon balance and cycling in linked aquatic and ocean ecosystems. Peatlands along the southern margins of the Eurasian permafrost are relatively underexplored despite the considerable risks associated with permafrost degradation due to climate warming. This study examined dynamics of DOC export from a permafrost peatland catchment located in northeastern China during the 2012 to 2014 growing seasons. The estimated annual DOC loads varied greatly between 3211 and 19 022 kg yr(-1), with a mean DOC yield of 4.7 gm(-2) yr(-1). Although the estimated DOC yield was in the lower range compared with other permafrost regions, it was still significant for the net carbon balance in the studied catchment. There were strong linkages between daily discharge and DOC concentrations in both wet and dry years, suggesting a transport-limited process of DOC delivery from the catchment. Discharge explained the majority of both seasonal and interannual variations of DOC concentrations, which made annual discharge a good indicator of total DOC load from the catchment. As indicated by three fluorescence indices, DOC source and chemical characteristics tracked the shift of flow paths during runoff processes closely. Interactions between the flow path and DOC chemical characteristics were greatly influenced by the seasonal thawing of the soil active layer. The deepening of the active layer due to climate warming likely increases the proportion of microbial-originated DOC in baseflow discharge.

AB The numerous water bodies and their riparian zones in the boreal zone are crucial to lateral carbon transport and can thus be very significant for carbon cycle on the landscape level. Therefore, we installed automatic measurement systems with Vaisala CARBOCAP CO2 probes (Vaisala Oyj, Vantaa, Finland) in the riparian zone soil matrix around a small headwater lake, in the lake itself, and in the out flowing brook and followed the seasonal and diurnal variation in CO2 concentration as well as rain event-driven changes in this natural-state soil-lake-brook continuum in Southern Finland. Seasonal variation was greatest and concentrations highest deep in the soil and in the lake, but were also noticeable in the brook. On the other hand, diurnal variation was highest in shallow soil layers and the lake surface. In the brook, the influence of the riparian zone superseded that of the lake at less than 150 m distance, which resulted in wider variation and higher concentrations of CO2 . After the rain event, the normal diurnal pattern was changed, and the CO2 concentration in the soil increased as water filled the soil pores and slowed down the diffusion. Even though the water with lower CO2 concentration from the lake diluted the CO2 concentration in the brook, the input from the soil dominated the flow after the rain and concentrations increased. On an annual basis, the flow of terrestrial dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into the aquatic ecosystem was 1-13% of terrestrial net ecosystem production (NEP).

AB Peatlands and other terrestrial ecosystems export large amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to freshwater ecosystems. In catchments used for supplying drinking water, water treatment works (WTWs) can remove large quantities of this organic matter, and can therefore play a unique modifying role in DOC processing and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the fluvial system. During this study we quantified the GHG emissions due to processes associated with carbon (C) removal during water treatment at four contrasting WTWs in the UK. Our results demonstrate that the removal of DOC from raw water supplies via coagulation, leading to the formation of sludge, usually makes it less susceptible to short-term oxidation when compared to DOC remaining in the fluvial system. Although this could be considered a means of reducing CO2 emissions from waterborne carbon, the current practise of land spreading of sludge is unlikely to represent a long-term C sink and therefore water treatment probably only delays the rate at which fluvial C re-enters the atmosphere. Furthermore, we estimate that indirect CO2 emissions resulting from electricity use during water treatment, together with the use of chemicals and CO2 degassing from the water during treatment, far outweigh any potential CO2 reductions associated with DOC removal. Thus, the post-treatment handling of sludge has the potential to mitigate, but not to negate, GHG emissions associated with water treatment processes.

AB Peat bogs have historically represented exceptional carbon (C) sinks because of their extremely low decomposition rates and consequent accumulation of plant remnants as peat. Among the factors favoring that peat accumulation, a major role is played by the chemical quality of plant litter itself, which is poor in nutrients and characterized by polyphenols with a strong inhibitory effect on microbial breakdown. Because bogs receive their nutrient supply solely from atmospheric deposition, the global increase of atmospheric nitrogen (N) inputs as a consequence of human activities could potentially alter the litter chemistry with important, but still unknown, effects on their C balance. Here we present data showing the decomposition rates of recently formed litter peat samples collected in nine European countries under a natural gradient of atmospheric N deposition from approximate to 0.2 to 2 g center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1). We found that enhanced decomposition rates for material accumulated under higher atmospheric N supplies resulted in higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and dissolved organic carbon release. The increased IN availability favored microbial decomposition (i) by removing N constraints on microbial metabolism and (ii) through a chemical amelioration of litter peat quality with a positive feedback on microbial enzymatic activity. Although some uncertainty remains about whether decay-resistant Sphagnum will continue to dominate litter peat, our data indicate that, even without such changes, increased N deposition poses a serious risk to our valuable peatland C sinks.

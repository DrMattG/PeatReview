AB The identity and distribution of substrates that support CH4 production in wetlands is poorly known at present. Organic compounds are the primary methanogenic precursor at all depths within anoxic wetland soils; however, the distribution of microbial processes by which these compounds are ultimately converted to CH4 is uncertain. Based on stable isotope measurements of CH4 and Sigma CO2 extracted from soil porewaters in two temperate zone wetlands, we present evidence that a systematic spatial distribution of microbial methanogenic pathways can exist in certain anoxic, organic-rich soils. CH4 production by the acetate fermentation pathway is favored in the shallow subsurface, while methanogenesis from the reduction of CO2 with H-2 becomes more predominant in older, less reactive peat at depth. This distribution can account for many of the reported CH4 emission characteristics of wetlands, factors play an important role in controlling the short-term supply of labile substrates to fermentive methanogens in the shallow subsurface where the most intense CH4 production occurs. Predominance of the CO2-reduction pathway at depth may help to explain reports of CH4 with a semifossil age in lower pear layers. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The present study was carried out in order to test the effect of grapevine rootstocks root growth on biomass and leaf nutrition status in extreme soil conditions. Own rooted cuttings of rootstocks Fercal, Teleki Kober 5BB, Georgikon 28 and four new rootstock hybrids from the breeding program of Georgikon Faculty, Hungary (FB01, JB01, Zamor 17 and SZF10) were grown 3 months in pots. The 5 L pots were filled with a layer of gravel, high lime content Rendzina soil (pH 8.54) topped with a layer of peat-soil mixture (pH 4.94). The biomass production, shoot, leaf and root development largely depended on the rootstocks genotype. The differences among studied rootstocks were significant under low pH. Correlation was found between the root dry weight and the aboveground parts. The ratio between them was strongly influenced by rootstocks genotype. Rootstocks had strong influence on leaf nutrient status.

AB Middle Pennsylvanian age coal beds from new outcrop exposures located along the northwest margin of the Eastern Kentucky Coal Field were sampled and analysed geochemically, petrographically and palynologically. Coal beds in the study section are bounded by two major marine shale members, the Betsie Shale Member near the base of the section, and the Magoffin Shale Member at the top. Analyses indicate that geochemical, petrographic and palynologic parameters of the coal beds are highly variable, and probably of peat accumulation in mires that were planar and topogenous with high periphery to area ratios. Palynologic analysis of the coal beds indicates they are all Middle Pennsylvanian in age, and correlative with Duckmantian (Westphalian B) age strata of western Europe, and Atokan age strata of the mid-continent, USA.

AB Little is known regarding the impact of land use on the isotopic signature of dissolved organic matter (DOM), although such impacts should occur first in this most mobile part of soil organic matter. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of both land use and change on the isotopic composition of DOM, We extracted water-soluble fulvic acids (FA) as the main fraction of DOM from the topsoil, groundwater, and surface water of six sites differing in land use in a natural fen area, and we analyzed C-13, C-14, and N-15. Long-term intensive land use (of at least 50 years) resulted in the enrichment of water-soluble FAs with C-13. Enhanced peat decomposition caused by conventional crop fanning resulted in the highest C-14 age of water-soluble FAs, The radiocarbon age of the water-soluble FAs in the topsoil and surface water was as much as 1700 years, much older than previously assumed. Long-term agricultural land use with high fertilizer input resulted in N-14 enrichment of water-soluble FAs, probably because of the incorporation of light N isotopes derived from mineral fertilizers. C-14 and N-15 isotopes indicated a distinct change of C and N turnover after changing from conventional crop farming to unimproved pasture. The N and C isotopes of water-soluble FAs are a useful tool to indicate changing C and N cycles caused by longterm (50 to 200 years) differences in land use. Short-term changes in land use (<5 years) are reflected only in the C-14 and N-15 signature of water-soluble FAs.

AB We report here the carbon dioxide (CO2) budget of a 98.6 km(2) subarctic tundra area in northeast European Russia based on measurements at two different scales and two independent upscaling approaches. Plot-scale measurements (chambers on terrestrial surfaces, gas gradient method and bubble collectors on lakes) were carried out from July 2007 to October 2008. The landscape-scale eddy covariance (EC) measurements covered the snow-free period of 2008. The annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of different land cover types ranged from -251 to 84 g C m(-2). Leaf area index (LAI) was an excellent predictor of the spatial variability in gross photosynthesis (GP), NEE and ecosystem respiration (ER). The plot-scale CO2 fluxes were first scaled up to the EC source area and then to the whole study area using two data sets: a land cover classification and a LAI map, both based on field data and a 2.4 m pixel-sized Quick-Bird satellite image. The good agreement of the CO2 balances for the EC footprint based on the different measuring techniques (-105 to -81 g C m(-2) vs. -79 g C m(-2); growing season 2008) justified the integration of the plot-scale measurements over the larger area. The regional CO2 balance based on area-integrated plot-scale measurements was -41 or -79 g C m(-2) yr(-1) according to the two upscaling methods, the land cover classification and the LAI map, respectively. Due to the heterogeneity of tundra, the effect of climate change on CO2 uptake will vary strongly according to the land cover type and, moreover, likely changes in their relative coverage in the future will have great impact on the regional CO2 balance.

TI Annual sulfate budgets for Dutch lowland peat polders: The soil is a

AB Annual sulfate mass balances have been constructed for four low-lying peat polders in the Netherlands, to resolve the origin of high sulfate concentrations in surface water, which is considered a water quality problem, as indicated amongst others by the absence of sensitive water plant species. Potential limitation of these plants to areas with low sulfate was analyzed with a spatial match-up of two large databases. The peat polders are generally used for dairy farming or nature conservation, and have considerable areas of shallow surface water (mean 16%, range 6-43%). As a consequence of continuous drainage, the peat in these polders mineralizes causing subsidence rates generally ranging between 2 and 10 mm y(-1). Together with pyrite oxidation, this peat mineralization the most important internal source of sulfate, providing an estimated 96 kg SO4 ha(-1) mm(-1) subsidence External sources are precipitation and water supplied during summer to compensate for water shortage, but these were found to be minor compared to internal release. The most important output flux is discharge of excess surface water during autumn and winter. If only external fluxes in and out of a polder are evaluated, inputs average 37 +/- 9 and exports 169 +/- 17 kg S ha(-1) y(-1). During summer, when evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall, sulfate accumulates in the unsaturated zone, to be flushed away and drained off during the wet autumn and winter. In some polders, upward seepage from early Holocene, brackish sediments can be a source of sulfate. Peat polders export sulfate to the regional water system and the sea during winter drainage. The available sulfate probably only plays a minor role in the oxidation of peat: we estimate that this is less than 10% whereas aerobic mineralization is the most important. Most surface waters in these polders have high sulfate concentrations, which generally decline during the growing season when aquatic sediments are a sink. In the sediment, this sulfur is reduced and binds iron more strongly than phosphorus, which can be released to the overlying water and potentially fuels eutrophication. About 76% of the sampled vegetation-sites exceeded a threshold of 50 mg l(-1), SO4, above which sensitive species, such as Stratiotes aloides, and several species of Potamogeton were significantly less abundant. Thus high sulfate concentrations, mainly due to land drainage and consequent mineralization, appear to affect aquatic plant community composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Aims Ozone effects on peatland vegetation are poorly understood. Since stress responses are often first visible in cell ultrastructure, electron microscopy was used to assess the sensitivity of common peatland plants to elevated ozone concentrations.
   Methods Three moss species (Sphagnum angustifolium, S. magellanicum and S. papillosum), a graminoid (Eriophorum vaginatum) and two dwarf shrubs (Vaccinium oxycoccus and Andromeda polifolia), all growing within an intact canopy on peat monoliths, were exposed to a concentration of 0, 50, 100 or 150 ppb ozone in two separate growth chamber experiments simulating either summer or autumn conditions in central Finland. After a 4- or 5-week-long exposure, samples were photographed in a transmission electron microscope and analysed quantitatively using image processing software.
   Key Results In the chlorophyllose cells of the Sphagnum moss leaves from the capitulum, ozone exposure led to a decrease in chloroplast area and in granum stack thickness and various changes in plastoglobuli and cell wall thickness, depending on the species and the experiment. In E. vaginatum, ozone exposure significantly reduced chloroplast cross-sectional areas and the amount of starch, whereas there were no clear changes in the plastoglobuli. In the dwarf shrubs. ozone induced thickening of the cell wall and an increase in the size of plastoglobuli under summer conditions. In contrast, under autumn conditions the cell wall thickness remained unchanged but ozone exposure led to a transient increase in the chloroplast and starch areas, and in the number and size of plastoglobuli.
   Conclusions Ozone responses in the Sphognum mosses were comparable to typical ozone stress symptoms of higher plants, and indicated sensitivity especially in S. angustifolium. The responses in the dwarf shrubs suggest stimulation of photosynthesis by low ozone concentrations and ozone sensitivity only under cool autumn conditions. (C) 2004 Annals of Botany Company.

AB Iron toxicity is a major soil constraint to rice,(Oryza sative L.) cropping in highland swamps of Burundi. These swamps have a wide range of carbon content. This study aims at determining the influence of carbon content and redox conditions on the release of iron from Fe-bearing minerals. The pe-pH pairs distribution and oxalate dissolution data strongly suggest a control of Fe2+ activity by a pool of poorly crystallized ferric oxides. Flooding results in high values of KCl-extractable Fe (up to 22 cmolc kg(-1)) being released from that pool. The iron release is positively correlated with organic matter. On the other hand, highly organic, peaty soils have large CEC and their adsorbed Fe fraction remains relatively low. As the exchangeable Fe fraction has previously been correlated with Fe toxicity to rice, we may conclude that very organic (> 25% C), peaty soils exhibit a lower Fe toxicity hazard than soils with intermediate carbon content (10-25%).

AB Extreme winter events that damage vegetation are considered an important climatic cause of arctic browning-a reversal of the greening trend of the region-and possibly reduce the carbon uptake of northern ecosystems. Confirmation of a reduction in CO2 uptake due to winter damage, however, remains elusive due to a lack of flux measurements from affected ecosystems. In this study, we report eddy covariance fluxes of CO2 from a peatland in northern Norway and show that vegetation CO2 uptake was delayed and reduced in the summer of 2014 following an extreme winter event earlier that year. Strong frost in the absence of a protective snow cover-its combined intensity unprecedented in the local climate record-caused severe dieback of the dwarf shrub species Calluna vulgaris and Empetrum nigrum. Similar vegetation damage was reported at the time along similar to 1000 km of coastal Norway, showing the widespread impact of this event. Our results indicate that gross primary production (GPP) exhibited a delayed response to temperature following snowmelt. From snowmelt up to the peak of summer, this reduced carbon uptake by 14 (0-24) g Cm-2 (similar to 12% of GPP in that period)-similar to the effect of interannual variations in summer weather. Concurrently, remotely-sensed NDVI dropped to the lowest level in more than a decade. However, bulk photosynthesis was eventually stimulated by the warm and sunny summer, raising total GPP. Species other than the vulnerable shrubs were probably resilient to the extreme winter event. The warm summer also increased ecosystem respiration, which limited net carbon uptake. This study shows that damage from a single extreme winter event can have an ecosystem-wide impact on CO2 uptake, and highlights the importance of including winter-induced shrub damage in terrestrial ecosystem models to accurately predict trends in vegetation productivity and carbon sequestration in the Arctic and sub-Arctic.

AB Greenhouse experiments on the effects of white potato cyst nematode infestations (Globodera pallida Stone) on initial growth and development of a series of potato cultivars are compared with the results of field experiments on sandy and sandy-peat soils on the effect of nematode density on tuber yield. A simple greenhouse test, assessing root growth response to potato cyst nematode infection, provided a good insight into a cultivar's tolerance performance in the field early in the growing season. As a very limited number of plants is needed for the greenhouse test, screening for tolerance can be conducted in the early stages of a breeding programme.

AB Phragmites australis litters were incubated in three waterlogged anoxic wetland soils of different nutrient status for 75 d, and litter nitrogen (N) dynamics were analyzed by elemental analyses and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). At the end of the incubation time, the N content in the remaining litter tissue had increased in most samples. Yet, the increase in N content was less pronounced when litters had been decomposed in a more-N-poor environment. FTIR was used to quantify the relative content of proteins in litter tissue and revealed a highly linear relationship between bulk N content and protein content. Changes in bulk N content thus paralleled and probably were governed by changes in litter protein content. Such changes are the result of two competing processes within decomposing litter: enzymatic protein depolymerization as a part of the litter breakdown process and microbial protein synthesis as a part of microbial biomass growth within the litter. Assuming microbial homeostasis, DNA signals in FTIR spectra were used to calculate the amount of microbial N in decomposed litter which ranged from 14% to 42% of the total litter N for all leaf samples. Microbial carbon (C) content and resultant calculated carbon use efficiencies (CUEs) indicate that microbial N in litter accumulated according to predictions of the stoichiometric decomposition theory. Subtracting microbial C and N contributions from litter, however, revealed site-dependent variations in the percentual amount of the remaining still-unprocessed plant N in litter compared to remaining plant C, an indicator for preferential protein depolymerization. For all leaf litters, the coefficient of preferential protein depolymerization (alpha), which relates N-compound depolymerization to C-compound depolymerization, ranged from 0.74-0.88 in a nutrient-rich detritus mud to 1.38-1.82 in Sphagnum peat, the most nutrient-poor substrate in this experiment. Preferential protein depolymerization from litter decomposing in Sphagnum peat leads to a gradual N depletion in the early phase of litter decomposition, which we propose as a preservation mechanism for vascular litter in Sphagnum peatlands.

AB Despite recent research into the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique for wetland mapping worldwide, its capability has not yet been thoroughly investigated for Canadian wetland ecosystems. Accordingly, this study statistically analysed interferometric coherence and SAR backscatter variation in a study area located on the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, consisting of various wetland classes, including bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow-water. Specifically, multi-temporal L-band ALOS PALSAR-1, C-band RADARSAT-2, and X-band TerraSAR-X data were used to investigate the effect of SAR frequency and polarization, as well as temporal baselines on the coherence degree in the various wetland classes. SAR backscatter and coherence maps were also used as input features into an object-based Random Forest classification scheme to examine the contribution of these features to the overall classification accuracy. Our findings suggested that the temporal baseline was the most influential factor for coherence maintenance in herbaceous wetlands, especially for shorter wavelengths. In general, coherence was the highest in L-band and intermediate/low for both X- and C-band, depending on the wetland classes and temporal baseline. The Wilcoxon rank sum test at the 5% significance level found significant difference (P-value < 0.05) between the mean values of HH/HV coherence at the peak of growing season. The test also suggested that L-band intensity and X-band coherence observations were advantageous to discriminate complex wetland classes. Notably, an overall classification accuracy of 74.33% was attained for land cover classification by synergistic use of both SAR backscatter and interferometric coherence. Thus, the results of this study confirmed the potential of incorporating SAR and InSAR features for mapping Canadian wetlands and those elsewhere in the world with similar ecological characteristics.

AB The key role of oxidation processes in the humification of peat-forming plant components was experimentally confirmed. A number of characteristic properties of the transformation of organic matter under conditions of the North, in particular, a decrease in the depth of humification and the pronounced predominance of the fulvate type of humification was revealed. It was established that special climatic effects are a factor affecting the formation of the group chemical composition of peat. It was demonstrated that, under the conditions of northern territories with consideration for the frost zone of a peat deposit, the conditions of oxidation and the kinetics of humification processes in the organic matter of peat in top and bottom layers can be essentially different; this fact explained the nonmonotonic changes in the characteristics of peat with the depth of occurrence. The effect of the bituminous component on the humification process of organic matter in the course of peat deposition was found; this was primarily due to the inhibition of the formation of polyconjugated structures, which are the main structure factor of humic substances.

   DYNAMICS
AB The diversity of ecosystems across boreal landscapes, successional changes after disturbance and complicated permafrost histories, present enormous challenges for assessing how vegetation, water and soil carbon may respond to climate change in boreal regions. To address this complexity, we used a chronosequence approach to assess changes in vegetation composition, water storage and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks along successional gradients within four landscapes: (1) rocky uplands on ice-poor hillside colluvium, (2) silty uplands on extremely ice-rich loess, (3) gravelly-sandy lowlands on ice-poor eolian sand and (4) peaty-silty lowlands on thick ice-rich peat deposits over reworked lowland loess. In rocky uplands, after fire permafrost thawed rapidly due to low ice contents, soils became well drained and SOC stocks decreased slightly. In silty uplands, after fire permafrost persisted, soils remained saturated and SOC decreased slightly. In gravelly-sandy lowlands where permafrost persisted in drier forest soils, loss of deeper permafrost around lakes has allowed recent widespread drainage of lakes that has exposed limnic material with high SOC to aerobic decomposition. In peaty-silty lowlands, 2-4 m of thaw settlement led to fragmented drainage patterns in isolated thermokarst bogs and flooding of soils, and surface soils accumulated new bog peat. We were not able to detect SOC changes in deeper soils, however, due to high variability. Complicated soil stratigraphy revealed that permafrost has repeatedly aggraded and degraded in all landscapes during the Holocene, although in silty uplands only the upper permafrost was affected. Overall, permafrost thaw has led to the reorganization of vegetation, water storage and flow paths, and patterns of SOC accumulation. However, changes have occurred over different timescales among landscapes: over decades in rocky uplands and gravelly-sandy lowlands in response to fire and lake drainage, over decades to centuries in peaty-silty lowlands with a legacy of complicated Holocene changes, and over centuries in silty uplands where ice-rich soil and ecological recovery protect permafrost.

AB Refining broiler manure to nitrogen (N) fertilizer products of consistent quality and balanced nutrient content could promote agronomic exploitation of this nutrient rich resource. For ensuring the effectiveness and sustainable use of such products, their plant available N supply needs to be known. In this study, the N fertilizer value of peat bedded broiler manure as pure granules (BM) and feather meal amended granules (BM+FM) was assessed in a pot experiment with ryegrass and field experiment with onion. The pot experiment examined also the performance of pure feather meal (FM) and slow pyrolyzed broiler manure (PyrBM). As measured by mineral N fertilizer equivalence, 68%, 45%-50%, 35%-43%, and 3% of the total N in FM, BM+FM, BM and PyrBM, respectively, was available to plants during the first growing season in favorable conditions. A minor (< 10 kg min-N ha(-1) soil) residual effect was recorded in 4-week post-harvest soil incubation. The performance of the products seemed predictable, although scarcely available N in the Sphagnum peat bedding limits the short-term availability of the granule total N content. By adjusting the amount and sort of amendment, fertilizer products designed for specific purposes can be produced from peat-bedded broiler manure. However, for pyrolyzed broiler manure, no N fertilizer effect can be expected. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CLIMATE CHANGES; SEQUENCE; EUROPE; SITE
AB In the Lomza region, northeastern Poland, many new lacustrine and peat deposits have been found. Pollen analysis of borehole material shows that they accumulated mostly during the Eemian Interglacial. Parts of these sites were active in the Vistulian, probably in its early phases. The sites analysed usually represent small lakes or peat-bogs sediment with accumulating in different time intervals of the Eemian. Only exceptionally they are represented by deep-water facies with a decrease in water level not before the hornbeam zone, as seen at many Eemian sites in Poland. Especially interesting is the occurrence in the pollen spectra of a number of exotic taxa such as Viburnum lantana, Bruckenthalia spiculifolia, Falcaria vulgaris, Lycopodium lucidulum t. noted previously in the Eemian Interglacial mainly in the south and in the southeastern Poland, where milder climatic conditions prevailed. The analysed interglacial spectra also show signs of plant-animal interaction. Such signs have been observed in Holocene and Vistulian strata, although in other pollen taxa. Pollen affected by these processes may come to resemble other species and so be misidentified.

AB The objective of this study was to extract and evaluate key catchment characteristics explaining the main variation in properties of dissolved natural organic matter (DNOM) in surface waters draining each catchment. A number of classical and sophisticated DNOM characterisation methodologies were used for this purpose. The explanatory capability of site characteristics on the variation in descriptors of DNOM, including elemental analysis (EA), DOC fractionation, SEC, CZE, CGE, UV/Vis- and FTIR spectra, FES, TLS, ESR, ESI/MS, C-13-CPMAS-NMR, potentiometric pH titration as well as functional characteristics such as biodegradability, and the response of macrophyte and PAH partitioning coefficients were evaluated. The sampling sites were all natural, coniferous, heathery-forested catchments with bogs, forming a climatic, anthropogenic deposition and proportional biotope cover gradient.
   Correlations to the main principal components, as well as a correlation matrix, singled out total S-deposition as the key explanatory site parameter, accounting for most of the variation in DNOM descriptors. Other significant factors were H+ concentration, length of growing season, biotope coverage (i.e., peatland/ or lake/watershed ratio), site elevation and TOC concentration. Total sulphur (S) deposition was strongly negatively correlated to the molecular weight, aromaticity, carboxylic acidity and sorption capacity of PAH. A greater proportion of lake and Histosol biotopes of the sampling sites were reflected in a greater aliphatic character of the DNOM. PCA clustering of samples from the same site in spring and fall showed a basic site-specific DNOM quality and a weak season effect. The Hasse diagram technique (a method of partial order theory) was used to show, for instance, how the relative Histosol coverage may determine NOM quality and, in turn, how this coincides with high macrophyte response.

AB Replanting of coastal dunes following forest fires often result in low seedling survival, as the site is characterized by loose sand, low water and nutrient availability, lack of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) inoculum and increased susceptibility to insects and diseases. The aim of the present work was to check whether certain treatments of root systems have any impact on Pinus sylvestris seedling establishment as compared with standard planting procedures. Treatments included: i) inoculation with vegetative mycelium of Cenococcum geophilum (CGV); ii) inoculation with vegetative mycelium of Suillus luteus (SLV); moreover, in each of those two treatments damp sphagnum peat / sand mixture was added to roots upon planting; iii) inoculation with basidiospores of S. luteus applied during preceding growing season in the nursery (SLB), and iv) standard planting, no treatment (control). A two hectare experimental plantation of P. sylvestris was established in the spring of 2007 on coastal dunes of the Curonian Spit in western Lithuania on a site of approx.100 year-old Pinus mugo plantation that one year previously was devastated by a forest fire and clear cut. The three treatments and control, comprising 2,500 seedlings each, were planted in rows as 16 replicates (5000 seedlings /ha). Results showed that after the first growing season seedling survival was poor in all treatments (5.1 - 30.0%), but seedlings in CGV, SLV and SLB showed respectively 591%, 533% and 196% better survival than no-treatment controls. Thus, inoculations with vegetative mycelia and addition of peat/sand mixture were by far the best, although the most labour-consuming. After two growing seasons, the proportion of ECM-colonised roots in treatments was 27.3 - 39.8%, while 22.5% in the controls, and observed ECM types resembled those from forest nurseries. In conclusion, investigated treatments had a considerable positive impact on seedling establishment under high-risk site conditions.

AB Estimating carbon sequestration and nutrient accumulation rates in Northeast China are important to assess wetlands function as carbon sink buffering greenhouse gas increasing in North Asia. The objectives of this study were to estimate accreting rates of carbon and nutrients in typical temperate wetlands. Results indicated that average soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) contents were 37.81%, 1.59% and 0.08% in peatlands, 5.33%, 0.25% and 0.05% in marshes, 2.92%, 0.27% and 0.10% in marshy meadows, respectively. Chronologies reconstructed by Pb-210 in the present work were acceptable and reliable, and the average time to yield 0-40 cm depth sediment cores was 150 years. Average carbon sequestration rate (Carbon(sq)), nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation rates were 219.4 g C/(m(2).yr), 9.16 g N/(m(2).yr) and 0.46 g P/(m(2).yr) for peatland; 57.13 g C/(m(2).yr), 5.42 g N/(m(2).yr) and 2.16 g P/(m(2).yr) for marshy meadow; 78.35 g C/(m(2).yr), 8.70 g N/(m(2).yr) and 0.71 g P/(m(2).yr) for marshy; respectively. Positive relations existed between Carbon(sq) with nitrogen and precipitations, indicating that Carbon(sq) might be strengthened in future climate scenarios.

AB Bioenergy crop cultivation on former peat extraction areas is a potential after-use option that provides a source of renewable energy while mitigating climate change through enhanced carbon (C) sequestration. This study investigated the full C and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of fertilized (RCG-F) and nonfertilized (RCG-C) reed canary grass (RCG; Phalaris arundinacea) cultivation compared to bare peat (BP) soil within an abandoned peat extraction area in western Estonia during a dry year. Vegetation sampling, static chamber and lysimeter measurements were carried out to estimate above- and belowground biomass production and allocation, fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in cultivated strips and drainage ditches as well as the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export, respectively. Heterotrophic respiration was determined from vegetation-free trenched plots. Fertilization increased the above- to belowground biomass production ratio and the autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration ratio. The full C balance (incl. CO2, CH4 and DOC fluxes from strips and ditches) was 96, 215 and 180g Cm(-2)yr(-1) in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively, suggesting that all treatments acted as C sources during the dry year. The C balance was driven by variations in the net CO2 exchange, whereas the combined contribution of CH4 and DOC fluxes was <5%. The GHG balances were 3.6, 7.9 and 6.6t CO2 eqha(-1)yr(-1) in RCG-F, RCG-C and BP, respectively. The CO2 exchange was also the dominant component of the GHG balance, while the contributions of CH4 and N2O were <1% and 1-6%, respectively. Overall, this study suggests that maximizing plant growth and the associated CO2 uptake through adequate water and nutrient supply is a key prerequisite for ensuring sustainable high yields and climate benefits in RCG cultivations established on organic soils following drainage and peat extraction.

ID SEQUESTRATION
AB The total amount of carbon held by vegetation in Great Britain is estimated to be 114 Mtonnes.
   Woodlands and forests hold 80% of the G.B. total although they occupy only about 11% of the rural land area. Broadleaf species hold about 50% of the carbon in woodlands and forests.
   A map of carbon in the vegetation of Great Britain at 1 km x 1 km resolution based on land cover identified in the I.T.E. Land Cover Map is presented. The predominant location of vegetation carbon is the broadleaved woodlands of southern England.
   The amount of carbon in the soils of Great Britain is estimated to be 9838 Mt (6948 Mt in Scotland and 2890 Mt in England and Wales).
   In Scotland, most soil carbon is in blanket peats, whereas most soil carbon is in stagnogley soils in England and Wales.
   The carbon content of the soils of Great Britain is mapped at 1 km x 1 km resolution. Scottish peat soils have the greatest density of carbon and in total contain 4523 Mt of carbon, 46% of the G.B. total. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB Ozone is a key trace gas in the troposphere; because it is a greenhouse gas, it is very reactive, and it is potentially toxic to humans, fauna, and vegetation. The main sink processes for ozone are chemical reactions and the turbulent deposition flux to the earth's surface. The deposition process itself is rather complex: The interactions between co-varying drivers such as the tropospheric ozone concentration, turbulence, and chemical reactions are not well understood. In the case of ozone deposition to vegetation, another aspect that must be studied is the role of stomatal regulation for a wide range of conditions. Therefore, we measured turbulent deposition fluxes of ozone with the eddy covariance technique during the peak of the growing season in 2014 over a managed, rewetted peatland in NW Germany. The deposition flux was large during the day (up to 15 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) and relatively small during the night (between 1 and 2 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). Fluxpartitioning by applying the surface resistance analogy and further analysis showed that the stomatal uptake was smaller than non-stomatal deposition. The correction of stomatal conductance with the gross primary production (GPP) improved the estimation of day- and nighttime stomatal deposition fluxes. Statistical analysis confirmed that the friction velocity (u(star)) was the single most important driver of non-stomatal ozone deposition and that relationships with other environmental drivers are not linear and highly variable. Further research is needed to develop a better process understanding of non-stomatal ozone deposition, to quantify the role of surface deposition to the ozone budget of the atmospheric boundary layer, and to estimate uncertainties associated with the partitioning of ozone deposition into stomatal and non-stomatal fluxes.

AB The study aimed to understand the inter-annual variations of methane (CH4) emissions from an open fen on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) from 2005 to 2007. The weighted mean CH4 emission rate was 8.37 +/- 11.32 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) during the summers from 2005 to 2007, falling in the range of CH4 fluxes reported by other studies, with significant inter-annual and spatial variations. The CH4 emissions of the year of 2006 (2.11 +/- 3.48 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) were 82% lower than the mean value of the years 2005 and 2007 (13.91 +/- 17.80 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 9.44 +/- 14.32 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively), responding to the inter-annual changes of standing water depths during the growing season of the three years. Significant drawdown of standing water depth is believed to cause such significant reduction in CH4 emissions from wetlands in the year 2006, probably through changing the methanogen composition and decreasing its community size as well as activating methanotrophs to enhance CH4 oxidation. Our results are helpful to understand the inter-annual variations of CH4 emission and provide a more reasonable regional budget of CH4 emission from wetlands on the QTP and even for world-wide natural wetlands under climate change.

AB Understanding the chronology of Norse settlement is crucial for deciphering the archaeology of many sites across the North Atlantic region and developing a timeline of human-environment interactions. There is ambiguity in the chronology of settlements in areas such as the Northern Isles of Scotland, arising from the lack of published sites that have been scientifically dated, the presence of plateaus in the radiocarbon calibration curve, and the use of inappropriate samples for dating. This novel study uses four absolute dating techniques (AMS radiocarbon, tephrochronology, spheroidal carbonaceous particles and archaeomagnetism) to date a Norse house (the "Upper House"), Underhoull, Unst, Shetland Isles and to interpret the chronology of settlement and peat which envelops the site. Dates were produced from hearths, activity surfaces within the structure, and peat accumulations adjacent to and above the structure. Stratigraphic evidence was used to assess sequences of dates within a Bayesian framework, constraining the chronology for the site as well as providing modelled estimates for key events in its life, namely the use, modification and abandonment of the settlement. The majority of the absolute dating methods produced consistent and coherent datasets. The overall results show that occupation at the site was not a short, single phase, as suggested initially from the excavated remains, but instead a settlement that continued throughout the Norse period. The occupants of the site built the longhouse in a location adjacent to an active peatland, and continued to live there despite the encroachment of peat onto its margins. We estimate that the Underhoull longhouse was constructed in the period cat AD 805-1050 (95% probability), and most probably in cal. AD 880-1000 (68% probability). Activity within the house ceased in the period cat AD 1230-1495 (95% probability), and most probably in cat AD 1260-1380 (68% probability). The Upper House at Underhoull provides important context to the expansion and abandonment of Norse settlement across the wider North Atlantic region. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The carbon sink function of peatlands is primarily driven by a higher production than decomposition of the litter Sphagnum mosses. The observed increase of vascular plants in peatlands could alter the decomposition rate and the carbon (C) cycle through a litter mixing effect, which is still poorly studied. Here, we examine the litter mixing effect of a peat moss (Sphagnum fallax) and two vascular plants (Pinus uncinata and Eriophorum vaginatum) in the field and laboratory-based experiment.
   During the laboratory incubation, mass loss, CO2 production, and dissolved organic carbon concentration were periodically monitored during 51 days. The collected data were then processed in a C dynamics model. The calculated enzymatic activity was correlated to the measured beta-glucosidase activity in the litter. In the field experiment, mass loss and CO2 production from litter bags were annually measured for 3 years.
   Both laboratory and field experiments clearly show that the litter mixture, i.e., Sphagnum-Pinus-Eriophorum, had a synergistic effect on decomposition by enhancing the mass loss. Such enhanced mass loss increased the water extractable C and CO2 production in the litter mixture during the laboratory experiment. The synergistic effect was mainly controlled by the Sphagnum-Eriophorum mixture that significantly enhanced both mass loss and CO2 production. Although the beta-glucosidase activity is often considered as a major driver of decomposition, mixing the litters did not cause any increase of the activity of this exo-enzyme in the laboratory experiment suggesting that other enzymes can play an important role in the observed effect.
   Mixing litters of graminoid and Sphagnum species led to a synergistic effect on litter decomposition. In a context of vegetation dynamics in response to environmental change, such a mixing effect could alter the C dynamics at a larger scale. Identifying the key mechanisms responsible for the synergistic effect on litter decomposition, with a specific focus on the enzymatic activities, is crucial to better predict the capacity of peatlands to act as C sinks.

AB Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) are located at the headwaters of streams on low relief plateaus of Eastern Australia. Swamp sediment structure has a direct link to the high water tables, element cycling and carbon sequestration that are the characteristic functions of these systems. By comparing the sediment structure of intact swamps and channelised fills, we can gain an understanding of how changes in swamp geomorphology change both swamp structure and function. We examined the sedimentology of six intact and six channelised fill swamps in the Blue Mountains NSW, Australia. There were significant differences in texture, unit thickness, Carbon: Nitrogen (C:N) ratios and moisture content between intact swamps and channelised fills. The presence and thickness of unmodified contemporary sand layers in almost all channelised fills and its absence in almost all intact swamps was a distinctive structural difference. The two functional swamp layers, in terms of water and carbon storage were almost double the mean thickness in intact swamps than in channelised fills. Moisture content was 30% higher in intact swamps than in channelised fills. Mean C:N ratios for channelised fills were 25% lower than that of intact swamps. Peat forming potential, as defined by C:N ratios >27, started at a greater depth in the sediment profile (0.9 m lower) in channelised fills than in intact swamps. It is clear from this study that these structural and functional indicators are important for assessing swamp condition and can also be useful in designing monitoring programs for management and rehabilitation that target key structural attributes that produce and maintain swamp function.

AB It is shown that peat bogs, which accumulate coal- and siderite-bearing sediments, serve as a generator of ferruginous solutions with the significant part of Fe migrating from them in the form of metalloorganic compounds. The stability of organic Fe-bearing complexes provides favorable conditions for the late diagenetic - catagenetic siderite formation in adjacent sea basins. It has been established that the formation of Phanerozoic coals, oil shales, and black shales was nearly coeval with the formation of goethite - chlorite - siderite ores. The paper discusses the influence of volcanic activity on the formation of Precambrian - Phanerozoic iron ore deposits and emphasizes the significance of siderite formation in the general evolution of the sedimentary iron ore formation.

AB The sorption and desorption characteristics of the major components of gasoline were determined for five media; sandy loam soil, organic top soil, clay soil, peat moss and granular activated carbon (GAC). Emphasis was placed on the sorption of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX), the aromatic hydrocarbons contained in gasoline. The results showed that the Freundlich isotherm satisfactorily described the sorption and desorption of dissolved BTEX on the media tested. The organic carbon content of the media was an important factor in both sorption and desorption, with the order of sorption preference being GAC, peat moss, organic top soil, clay soil and sandy loam soil. The soil-water partition coefficient (K(oc)) for the BTEX compounds and Total BTEX suggests that the BTEX compounds will migrate quickly through soil, with benzene being the fastest followed by toluene, m-, p- and o-xylenes and ethylbenzene.

AB Snow cover is one of the key factors controlling Arctic ecosystem functioning and productivity. In this study we assess the impact of strong variability in snow accumulation during 2 subsequent years (2013-2014) on the land-atmosphere interactions and surface energy exchange in two high-Arctic tundra ecosystems (wet fen and dry heath) in Zackenberg, Northeast Greenland. We observed that record-low snow cover during the winter 2012/2013 resulted in a strong response of the heath ecosystem towards low evaporative capacity and substantial surface heat loss by sensible heat fluxes (H) during the subsequent snowmelt period and growing season. Above-average snow accumulation during the winter 2013/2014 promoted summertime ground heat fluxes (G) and latent heat fluxes (LE) at the cost of H. At the fen ecosystem a more muted response of LE, H and G was observed in response to the variability in snow accumulation. Overall, the differences in flux partitioning and in the length of the snowmelt periods and growing seasons during the 2 years had a strong impact on the total accumulation of the surface energy balance components. We suggest that in a changing climate with higher temperature and more precipitation the surface energy balance of this high-Arctic tundra ecosystem may experience a further increase in the variability of energy accumulation, partitioning and redistribution.

AB Soil carbon stores are a major component of the annual returns required by EU governments to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Peat has a high proportion of soil carbon due to the relatively high carbon density of peat and organic-rich soils. For this reason it has become increasingly important to measure and model soil carbon stores and changes in peat stocks to facilitate the management of carbon changes over time. The approach investigated in this research evaluates the use of airborne geophysical (radiometric) data to estimate peat thickness using the attenuation of bedrock geology radioactivity by superficial peat cover. Remotely sensed radiometric data are validated with ground peat depth measurements combined with non-invasive geophysical surveys. Two field-based case studies exemplify and validate the results. Variography and kriging are used to predict peat thickness from point measurements of peat depth and airborne radiometric data and provide an estimate of uncertainty in the predictions. Cokriging, by assessing the degree of spatial correlation between recent remote sensed geophysical monitoring and previous peat depth models, is used to examine changes in peat stocks over time. The significance of the coregionalisation is that the spatial cross correlation between the remote and ground based data can be used to update the model of peat depth. The result is that by integrating remotely sensed data with ground geophysics, the need is reduced for extensive ground-based monitoring and invasive peat depth measurements. The overall goal is to provide robust estimates of peat thickness to improve estimates of carbon stocks. The implications from the research have a broader significance that promotes a reduction in the need for damaging onsite peat thickness measurement and an increase in the use of remote sensed data for carbon stock estimations.

AB Tephras are important for the NZ-INTIMATE project because they link all three records comprising the composite inter-regional stratotype developed for the New Zealand climate event stratigraphy (NZ-CES). Here we firstly report new calendar ages for 24 widespread marker tephras erupted since 30,000 calendar (cal.) years ago in New Zealand to help facilitate their use as chronostratigraphic dating tools for the NZ-CES and for other palaeoenvironmental and geological applications. The selected tephras comprise 12 rhyolitic tephras from Taupo, nine rhyolitic tephras from Okataina, one peralkaline rhyolitic tephra from Tuhua, and one andesitic tephra each from Tongariro and Egmont/Taranaki volcanic centres. Age models for the tephras were obtained using three methods: (i) C-14-based wiggle-match dating of wood from trees killed by volcanic eruptions (these dates published previously); (ii) flexible depositional modelling of a high-resolution C-14-dated age depth sequence at Kaipo bog using two Bayesian-based modelling programs, Bacon and OxCal's P_Sequence function, and the IntCal09 data set (with SH offset correction -44 +/- 17 yr); and (iii) calibration of C-14 ages using OxCal's Tau_Boundary function and the SHCal04 and IntCal09 data sets. Our preferred dates or calibrated ages for the 24 tephras are as follows (youngest to oldest, all mid-point or mean ages of 95% probability ranges): Kaharoa AD 1314 +/- 12; Taupo (Unit Y) AD 232 +/- 10; Mapara (Unit X) 2059 +/- 118 cal. yr BP; Whakaipo (Unit V) 2800 +/- 60 cal. yr BP; Waimihia (Unit S) 3401 +/- 108 cal. yr BP; Stent (Unit Q) 4322 +/- 112 cal. yr BP; Unit K 5111 +/- 210 cal. yr BP; Whakatane 5526 +/- 145 cal. yr BP; Tuhua 6577 +/- 547 cal. yr BP; Mamaku 7940 +/- 257 cal. yr BP; Rotoma 9423 +/- 120 cal. yr BP; Opepe (Unit E) 9991 +/- 160 cal. yr BP; Poronui (Unit C) 11,170 +/- 115 cal. yr BP; Karapiti (Unit B) 11,460 172 cal. yr BP; Okupata 11,767 192 cal. yr BP; Konini (bed b) 11,880 +/- 183 cal. yr BP; Waiohau 14,009 +/- 155 cal. yr BP; Rotorua 15,635 +/- 412 cal. yr BP; Rerewhakaaitu 17,496 +/- 462 cal. yr BP; Okareka 21,858 +/- 290 cal. yr BP; Te Rere 25,171 +/- 964 cal. yr BP; Kawakawa/Oruanui 25,358 +/- 162 cal. yr BP; Poihipi 28,446 +/- 670 cal. yr BP; and Okaia 28,621 +/- 1428 cal. yr BP.
   Secondly, we have re-dated the start and end of the Lateglacial cool episode (climate event NZce-3 in the NZ-CES), previously referred to as the Lateglacial climate reversal, as defined at Kaipo bog in eastern North Island, New Zealand, using both Bacon and OxCal P Sequence modelling with the IntCal09 data set. The ca 1200-yr-long cool episode, indicated by a lithostratigraphic change in the Kaipo peat sequence to grey mud with lowered carbon content, and a high-resolution pollen-derived cooling signal, began 13,739 +/- 125 cal. yr BP and ended 12,550 +/- 140 cal. yr BP (mid-point ages of the 95% highest posterior density regions, Bacon modelling). The OxCal modelling, generating almost identical ages, confirmed these ages. The Lateglacial cool episode (ca 13.8-12.6 cal. ka BP) thus overlaps a large part of the entire Antarctic Cold Reversal chronozone (ca 14.1-12.4 cal. lea BP or ca 14.6-12.8 cal. lea BP), and an early part of the Greenland Stadial-1 (Younger Dryas) chronozone (ca 12.9-11.7 cal. ka BP). The timing of the Lateglacial cool episode at Kaipo is broadly consistent with the latitudinal patterns in the Antarctic Cold Reversal signal suggested for the New Zealand archipelago from marine and terrestrial records, and with records from southern South America.

AB The cell density, activity, and community structure of the bacterial community in wetland sediments were monitored over a 13-month period. The study was performed at Cedar Bog, an alkaline fen. The objective was to characterize the relationship between the sediment bacterial community in groundwater upwelling zones and the physical and chemical factors which might influence the community structure and activity. DNA, protein, and lipid synthesis were measured at three different upwelling zones by using [H-3]thymidine, [C-14]leucine, and [C-14]glucose incorporation, respectively. The physiological status (apparent stress) of the consortium was assessed by comparing [C-14]glucose incorporation into membrane and that into storage lipids. Bacterial cell density was determined by acridine orange direct counts, and gross bacterial community structure was determined by bisbenzimidazole-cesium chloride gradient analysis of total bacterial community DNA. Both seasonal and site-related covariation were observed in all estimates of bacterial biomass and activity. Growth rate estimates and cell density peaked in late July at 2.5 x 10(8) cells/g/day and 2.7 x 10(9) cells/g, respectively, and decreased in December to 2.0 x 10(7) cells/g/day and 1.5 x 10(9) cells/g, respectively. Across sites, membrane-to-storage-lipid ratios were generally highest in late spring and peaked in September for one site. Overall, the data indicate dynamic seasonal differences in sediment bacterial community activity and physiology, possibly in response to changing physical and chemical environmental factors which included the C/N/P ratios of the perfusing groundwater. By contrast, total cell numbers were rather constant, and community structure analysis indicated that the overall community structure was similar throughout the study.

AB We studied the effects of different soil P status (P-deficient, P-poor and P-rich fen soils) on growth, root allocation and P and N-uptake of Carer species from fens differing in P-availability. We carried out a 3-month pot experiment where the three species were grown in each soil. Carer acutiformis, a species from eutrophic fens, showed the highest production under all soil conditions and changes in biomass allocation to belowground parts, but not in specific root length (SRL) or root length/leaf area ratio (RLLA) in response to changes in the P-soil status. Carer lasiocarpa Ehrh., a species from P-limited areas, showed intermediate biomass production and low inherent root weight ratio (RWR). Carer diandra Schrank., a species from areas where the growth of the vegetation is limited by nitrogen, showed low biomass production in all three fen soils studied, and no changes in its high specific root length (SRL) or root weight ratio (RWR) with soil phosphorus status. All three Carer species showed the best growth under P-poor conditions and a very reduced growth on the P-limited soil. Phosphorus uptake by Carer species was affected by P-soil status being lowest under P-deficient conditions for all three Carer species. P-soil status also affected N-uptake which was lower under P-deficient conditions than in the other two soils.
   It can be concluded that the success of both small Carer species in nutrient poor sites cannot be explained by higher relative growth rate, biomass production or nutrient uptake than the species from eutrophic areas. Other factors (water and soil chemistry other than N and P richness, presence of a bryophyte layer, establishment of seedlings, clonal reproduction, competition ability) must play a role in determining the distinct distribution pattern of these species.

AB We tested whether upland or peatland location affected rates of litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics. We examined the patterns of mass loss and carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) gain, retention, or loss in 11 forest tissues over 6 years at three upland and three peatland sites in the Low Boreal, High Boreal, and Low Subarctic zones of central Canada. After 6 years of decomposition, the average litter mass remaining ranged from 35% for fescue grass to 75% for western redcedar needles and 94% for wood blocks placed on the soil surface, with exponential decay coefficients (k) of -0.16, -0.05, and -0.01, respectively. At one pair of sites, the mass remaining and the k values indicated that faster decomposition occurred in the upland site than in the nearby peatland site. The reverse was the case in a second pair. No overall pattern was apparent in the third. In general, Douglas-fir needles decomposed significantly faster in peatland than upland sites, and the reverse pattern occurred for bracken fern. Most foliar litters retained their original N mass and lost P as they decomposed. There were few major differences between N and P dynamics in litters decomposing at upland and peatland sites, though N and P retention in some cases was greater at the peatland sites. These results suggest that longer term (>6 years) differences in decomposition rate and differences in litter quality account for larger C accumulation in peatland than in upland soils.

AB There is considerable interest in quantitative determination of the contributions of black carbon to soil and sediment organic matter because of its potential influence on the transport and bioavailability of organic contaminants. In this study, recoupled long-range dipolar dephasing solid-state C-13 NMR was used to evaluate the black carbon content differences in a Guanella Pass peat (GPP) and the IHSS leonardite organic matter samples. Activated carbon was used for comparison. This technique is based on long-range dipolar dephasing which is obtained by recoupling of long-range C-H dipolar interactions using two H-1 180 degrees pulses per rotation period. Compared to standard dipolar dephasing, C-H recoupling greatly increases the dephasing efficiency. Direct C-13 polarization was applied to prevent loss of the signals of interest because carbon atoms that are distant from protons cross-polarize poorly. Compared to the peat, slow dephasing was observed for the aromatic carbon in leonardite; and even slower dephasing was observed in activated carbon. At a dipolar dephasing time of 1 ms, almost all the aromatic-C signals of the peat have been dephased, while more than 1/4 of the aromatic carbon signal remains in the IHSS leonardite. Even after a dipolar dephasing time of 2 ms, the aromatic signal of activated carbon is still significant (20%). Ding and Rice [Ding, G., Rice, J.A., 2011. Effects of lipids on hydrophobic organic compound sorption/desorption hysteresis in natural organic matter. Chemosphere 84, 519-526.] used naphthalene and phenanthrene to examine the correlations between sorption/desorption hysteresis and carbon characteristics in the IHSS leonardite and the GPP. It demonstrated that during the sorption and desorption of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons to these natural organic matter samples, the hysteresis is positively correlated with the black carbon content in the peat and leonardite samples.

AB The size of the soil microbial biomass was measured in a more than 30 yr old field experiment, whose treatments included different N fertilizers and organic manures. The size of the microbial biomass was measured as biomass C and N by the chloroform fumigation-incubation technique, as K2SO4 extractable ninhydrin-reactive N released upon fumigation and as the soil's ATP content. There was a high degree of correlation (r > 0.88) between the fumigation-based methods and the ATP determinations. Compared with the biomass estimate by ATP, biomass C was underestimated in the ammonium sulphate fertilized soil (pH 4.4), the peat-amended soils, and the sewage sludge amended soil. Biomass N was only under-estimated in the ammonium sulphate and peat-amended soil, whereas there was a good correlation between the ninhydrin assay and the ATP assay for all soils. Between three successive years biomass C showed larger, statistically significant, variations than the size of the biomass measured by the ninhydrin assay.
   There was a high degree of correlation (r > 0.90) between both the rate of base respiration and the size of the microbial biomass and the soil's carbon content. These relationships generally held independent of whether carbon was derived from stabilized soil organic matter (in the fallow soil), from crop residues, or from organic manures such as straw, green manure, farmyard manure, or sawdust.
   Relative to the soil's carbon content the microbial biomass was smaller than expected in the peat amended-soils, the ammonium sulphate fertilized, and the sewage sludge-amended soil. The rate of base respiration was only lower than expected in the sewage sludge treated soil. The size of the biomass was negatively affected by a low soil pH, but the rate of base respiration was not. Liming some of the soils indicated that other factors than low pH restricted the size of the biomass in the peat and sewage-sludge amended soils, but not in the ammonium sulphate fertilized soils.

AB Soil solution was collected to identify seasonal trends in its chemistry and to examine relationships between the concentrations of ions and variables that may control them. Samples were collected fortnightly at 10 cm and 50 cm depth in a blanket peat soil at Moor House-Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve in the northern Pennine uplands of England. Dissolved organic carbon at 10 cm peaked each summer and correlated most strongly with temperature. At both depths Na+ and Cl- were the dominant ions, reflecting the oceanic climate. Over the 3-year sampling period, concentrations of the principal anions and cations at 10 cm varied little except during the autumns of 1994 and 1995 following unusually dry summers. At these times concentrations of SO42--S increased from < 3 <mu>mol to a maximum of 430 mu mol and were balanced by smaller increases in Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and H+. The SO42- concentration at 10 cm was most strongly correlated with depth to the water table 3 weeks prior to sampling. At 50 cm depth in the peat a small increase in SO42- occurred only during the autumn of 1995, and the concentration of SO42- at this depth correlated most strongly with that at 10 cm. At neither depth were there any strong correlations with deposition. The increase in H+ concentration associated with the peak in SO42- at 10 cm depth represents a fall in pH from usual values around 4.2 to 3.5.

AB Sorption studies were conducted to determine the adsorption and desorption characteristics of a common synthetic chemical, trichloroethylene (TCE) in four granular media; sandy loam soil, organic top soil, peat moss and granular activated carbon (GAC). The results showed that the Freundlich Isotherm satisfactorily represents adsorption and desorption of dissolved TCE in these media and that the organic carbon content is an important factor in both processes. The soil-water partition coefficient (K(oc)) for TCE suggests that it will migrate quickly through soil.

AB Peatlands store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Drainage, required for agriculture, aerates these organic soils and triggers rapid peat decomposition. In turn, cultivation of organic soils is also accompanied by input of young organic carbon (YOC) from plant residues. The extent to which YOC inputs compensate for oxidative peat loss is unknown. Furthermore, the lability of YOC in organic soils introduced by cultivation has never been examined. Here we studied the amount and lability of YOC in two adjacent drained organic soils by a combined C-13 and C-14 approach. Soils haVe been under intensive arable use for several decades and were both cultivated, inter alia, with corn, a C4 plant. In 1995, one soil was converted from annual cropping to permanent cultivation with Miscanthus x giganteus, another C4 plant, while the other was converted to permanent C3 grassland in 2009. Using delta C-13 signatures, we analysed the fractions of C4 derived carbon in the soil and in CO2, during one month of soil incubation. This enabled us i) to estimate C4-C accumulation in both soils, and ii) to assess the lability of C4-C carbon that accumulated either at least five years prior to sampling (current grassland soil) or until sampling (current Miscanthus soil). The fraction of C4-C derived SOC in the Miscanthus soil was 0.19 +/- 0.024 in the top 30 cm, corresponding to an accumulation rate of 1.6 +/- 0.2 t C4-C ha-(1) yr(-1). This accumulation rate is in the range of rates found for fertile mineral soils cultivated with Miscanthus. Yet, this C4-C accumulation rate is below average C-losses of agriculturally used organic soils. The grassland soil contained a smaller fraction of 0.08 +/- 0.002 C4-C in SOC. The rates of total CO2 emitted from the two soils did not differ, but the fraction of CO2 derived from C4-C was significantly higher in the Miscanthus soil (0.53 0.05) than in the grassland (0.29 0.04) soil. Hence, in both soils YOC was more labile than bulk SOC. The ratio between the fraction of decomposing C4-C and C4-C in SOC was the same for both soils indicating a similar lability of currently accumulated and aged C4-C. In both soils, the 14C age of emitted CO2 was younger than that of SOC, confirming an increased lability of YOC over old SOC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   SEDIMENTS
AB Preservation of organic matter (OM) in the geosphere has a direct impact on carbon bioavailability, the carbon cycle and the formation of fossil fuels. We have examined some of the processes that lead to the preservation of OM by characterising insoluble OM in a Sphagnum peat bog. We focussed on the partitioning of prokaryotic biomarkers between solvent-extractable and insoluble OM fractions and how that partitioning changed with depth. The insoluble organic matter (IOM) was examined using stepwise chemical degradation involving base and acid hydrolysis. Iso-and anteiso-C-15 and C-17 fatty acids (FAs), hopanoic acid and bishomohopanol, and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) diagnostic for Bacteria - were targeted as well as archaeol and isoprenoidal GDGTs - diagnostic for Archaea. High percentages of these compounds - up to 65% - occur in IOM pools, indicating that archaeal-and bacterially derived OM is prone to insolubilization even in shallow sediments (< 5 cm depth). Differences in functionalities - likely related to intact polar (IP) head groups - seem to determine the insolubilization of prokaryotic lipids; specifically, we propose that compounds bearing rapidly degradable phosphate-based polar head groups are less likely to be incorporated into the insoluble OM pools. Collectively, these data indicate that microbial membrane lipids are rapidly incorporated into peat IOM during early diagenesis. We suggest that this is due to an inherently recalcitrant character of some prokaryotic cells which affords protection to their membrane lipids. However, this large proportion of insoluble prokaryotic lipids does not appear to be entirely stable at shallow burial depths, indicating that the peat IOM is a dynamic reservoir, at least during early diagenesis.

AB A destructive peat horizon T-md of bare peat circles on flat-topped peat mounds in the north of Western Siberia differs from peat horizons (T) of typical peat soils in its higher density, water content, and comminution of peat residues; lower microbial biomass; low mineralization and hydrolase activities; low physiological diversity of hydrolytic bacteria; and specific composition of the fungal complex with an uncharacteristically high proportion and quantity of psychrophilic yeasts Leucosporidium drummii. Specific respiration rate and hydrolase activity in the T-md and T horizons are relatively close, which indicates that, in general, the metabolic activity of microorganisms decomposing the organic matter of peat and increasing the degree of peat decomposition remains unchanged in the soils of bare peat circles.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the influence of mycorrhizal inoculation and sand-peat composition as growth substrate on the biomass, and individual polyphenol concentration of Eclipta prostrata. Mycorrhizal inoculation alters some secondary metabolites of E. prostrata, showing significant differences in polyphenol contents between the treatments. Moreover, varying peat and sand rates, representing different nutrient supplies, had significant impacts on both mycorrhizal colonization and growth responses. Our results highlight that 60/40% (v/v) sand and peat ration is the best for a large-scale cultivation of E. prostrata, moreover supporting the highest total phenolic content. Through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, nine individual phenolic components were analyzed, including wedelolactone and demethyl-wedelolactone at the highest concentration. Some of the identified compounds, such as 5-o-caffeoylquinic acid, quercetin-3-arabinoside, 4-o-caffeoylquinic acid, and protocatechuic acid have not been reported previously in E. prostrata cultivars. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, multiple groups are represented, suggesting the role of mycorrhizal inoculation, growth substrate, and their interaction on secondary metabolites of E. prostrata. Better understanding of the phenolic composition of E. prostrata and factors influencing it help to identify new industrial applications of this medicinal plant (together with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi), and moreover, help to develop new strategies for the prevention and treatment of different diseases.

AB The Arctic is extremely Vulnerable to projected climate change. and global warming may result in major community reorganizations. The aim of this study was it thorough investigation of plant biomass production throughout a entire growing season in five different high arctic vegetation types: Cassiope, Dryas, and Salix heath, grassland. and fell. The main focus was on the gross ecosystem production (GEP), and the biotic and abiotic factors which may influence GEP. Photosynthesis, aboveground biomass, and carbon, nitrogen, and chlorophyll content were measured weekly during nine weeks.
   There were large differences in seasonal growth and production within and among vegetation types. Mosses contributed considerably to the total C and N pool in grassland, fen, and Salix heath. Fell, which had the highest pool of leaf N, leaf chlorophyll. and moss N, was the most productive vegetation type in terms of GEP, despite the lowest total biomass. Across vegetation types. leaf biomass, leaf N, and moss N pool size influenced GEP. Within most vegetation types GEP correlated with leaf N, in correspondence with the notion that N may limit plant production in many high arctic ecosystems. The timing of the peaks in C and N pools in leaves did not coincide with that in the mosses and in woody tissues. This emphasizes the importance of sampling throughout the growing season, when using Field data from the Arctic to estimate plant biomasses and modeling C and N fluxes and pool sizes.

AB The biodegradation of different peat types was studied with a manometric respirometric test. Compaction peat and sphagnum peat samples were analysed, and the effect of peat pH on biodegradation behaviour was evaluated. Only minor (BOD/ThOD < 0.4%) biodegradation was observed with compaction peat samples, and the stable state, in which biodegradation stopped, was achieved during a two month period. As expected, sphagnum peat samples with a lower decomposition rate degraded more than compaction peat samples. Alkalinity (pH between ca. 4-9) of the peat was noticed to reduce the degree of biodegradation and accelerate the achievement of the stable state.

AB Arctic soils hold large amounts of nutrients in the weatherable minerals and the soil organic matter, which slowly decompose. The decomposition processes release nutrients to the plant-available nutrient pool as well as greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Changes in climatic conditions, for example, changes in the distribution of snow, water balance and the length of the growing season, are likely to affect the complex interactions between plants, abiotic and biotic soil processes as well as the composition of soil micro- and macro-fauna and thereby the overall decomposition rates. These interactions, in turn, will influence soil-plant functioning and vegetation composition in the short as well as in the long term.
   In this chapter, we report on soils and. plant communities and their distribution patterns in the valley Zackenbergdalen and focus on the detailed investigations within five dominating plant communities. These five communities are located along an ecological gradient in the landscape and are closely related to differences in water availability. They are therefore indirectly formed as a result of the distribution of landforms, redistribution of snow and drainage conditions. Each of the plant communities is closely related to specific nutrient levels and degree of soil development including soil element accumulation and translocation, for example, organic carbon.
   Results presented here show that different parts of the landscape have responded quite differently to the same overall climate changes the last 10 years and thus, most likely in the future too. Fens represent the wettest sites holding large reactive buried carbon stocks. A warmer climate will cause a permafrost degradation, which most likely will result in anoxic decomposition and increasing methane emissions. However, the net gas emissions at fen sites are sensitive to long-term changes in the water table level. Indeed, increasing maximum active layer depth at fen sites has been recorded together with a decreasing water level at Zackenberg. This is in line with the first signs of increasing extension of grasslands at the expense of fens.
   In contrast, the most exposed and dry areas have less soil carbon, and decomposition processes are periodically water limited. Here, an increase in air temperatures may increase active layer depth more than at fen sites, but water availability will be critical in determining nutrient cycling and plant production. Field manipulation experiments of increasing temperature, water supply and nutrient addition show that soil-plant interactions are sensitive to these variables. However, additional plant-specific investigations are needed before net effects of climate changes on different landscape and plant communities can be integrated in a landscape context and used to assess the net ecosystem effect of future climate scenarios.

AB Peat sections, measuring up to 40 cm, from four areas of Spitsbergen were studied for pollen and spores; the results are presented as pollen concentration diagrams.  Dated parts of the sections cover approximately the last three to thirteen centuries.  In one section, an increasing rate of peat accumulation is suggested by a decreasing trend in concentrations of long-distance transported pollen and spores and by radiocarbon dates; in the other three sections there are no indications of the existence of phases differing in peat-accumulation rates.  In two sections a local development is recorded from dry peat-forming vegetation relatively rich in vascular-plant species into wet peat-forming vegetation poor in vascular-plant species.  The two other sections represent wet peat-forming vegetation relatively poor in vascular-plant species throughout the recorded period.

TI Peat mounds of southwest Tasmania: possible origins

DE carbon dating; Holocene; palynology; peat mounds; Pleistocene; Tasmania
ID VEGETATION; AUSTRALIA; CLIMATES
AB Small mounds of peat rise several metres above the level of the water-table at Melaleuca Inlet and Louisa Plains on the buttongrass plains in southwest Tasmania. Possible origins of the peat mounds hove been explored by pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating of a set of samples taken from a vertical section of one peal mound at Melaleuca. The peat accumulation is entirely of Holocene age although the mound is underlain by sapric peats preserving a cold climate palynoflora of probable late Pleistocene age. Peals at and near the base of the mound accumulated under a heath sedgeland during the earliest Holocene while after about 7630 a BP the peat-forming vegetation was shrub-dominated. The radiocarbon data indicate two main phases of overall peat accumulation, between 7630 and 5340 a BP (Middle Holocene) and between 4450 and 450 a BP (Late Holocene), that were interrupted by a wildfire which burnt into the surface peats, The maintenance of high surface and internal levels of moisture almost certainly was the critical factor behind the low incidence of in situ fires burning into the surface peats on the mound. The perennial influx of groundwater below the mound is a possible origin that fits well with our observations, although the expansion and contraction of soils cannot be discounted as an initiating factor. Enhanced nutrient input from birds may have helped promote growth in the peat-forming communities. The data do not support the mounds being eroded remnants of a former blanket peat cover or being due to periglacial activity. The peat mounds of southwest Tasmania deserve maximum protection because of their rarity in the Australian landscape and, it seems, elsewhere.

AB Stable Zn isotopes fractionation was studied in main biogeochemical compartments of a pristine larch forest of Central Siberia developed over continuous permafrost basalt rocks. Two north-and south-oriented watershed slopes having distinctly different vegetation biomass and active layer depth were used as natural proxy for predicting possible future climate changes occurring in this region. In addition, peat bog zone exhibiting totally different vegetation, hydrology and soil temperature regime has been studied.
   The isotopic composition of soil profile from Central Siberia is rather constant with a delta Zn-66 value around 0.2 parts per thousand close to the value of various basalts. Zn isotopic composition in mosses (Sphagnum fuscum and Pleurozium schreberi) exhibits differences between surface layers presenting values from 0.14 to 0.2 parts per thousand and bottom layers presenting significantly higher values (0.5 - 0.7 parts per thousand) than the underlain mineral surface. The humification of both dead moss and larch needles leads to retain the fraction where Zn bound most strongly thus releasing the lighter isotopes in solution and preserving the heavy isotopes in the humification products, in general accord with previous experimental and modeling works [GCA 75:7632-7643, 2011].
   The larch (Larix gmelinii) from North and South-facing slopes is enriched in heavy isotopes compared to soil reservoir while larch from Sphagnum peatbog is enriched in light isotopes. This difference may result from stronger complexation of Zn by organic ligands and humification products in the peat bog compared to mineral surfaces in North- and South-facing slope.
   During the course of the growing period, Zn followed the behavior of macronutrients with a decrease of concentration from June to September. During this period, an enrichment of larch needles by heavier Zn isotopes is observed in the various habitats. We suggest that the increase of the depth of rooting zone, and the decrease of DOC and Zn concentration in soil solution from the root uptake zone with progressively thawing soil could provoke heavy isotopes to become more available for the larch roots at the end of the vegetative season compared to the beginning of the season, because the decrease of DOC will facilitate the uptake of heavy isotope as it will be less retained in strong organic complexes.

AB A multidisciplinary study was undertaken at the Qijurittuq Site (IbGk-3) on Drayton Island in Low-Arctic Quebec (Canada) to document the relationships between climatic, environmental, and cultural changes and the choice of Thule/Inuit dwelling style in the eastern Arctic. Several marine terraces were (14)C-dated with shells in order to reconstruct the area's uplift (glacioiso-static rebound) curve. Plant macrofossil analysis of peat was conducted to reconstruct past vegetation and, indirectly, past climate. Archaeological surveys and excavations characterized the structure of subterranean sod houses at the Qijurittuq Site and were supplemented with open interviews with Inuit elders for a better understanding of site location and the use of household space. The sites selected for habitation were well-drained sandy marine terraces in a valley sheltered from prevailing winds. Sod houses were in turn made possible by the abundance of driftwood on the island and the presence of nearby peatland. Thule/Inuit people used semi-subterranean houses rather than igloos at the Qijurittuq Site during the dry, cold conditions toward the end of the Little Ice Age. Stable environmental conditions and food supply during winter possibly explain the use of those semipermanent houses on Drayton Island. However, it does not exclude the use of igloos during short expeditions on ice. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The interaction of plant and microbial communities are known to influence the dynamics of methane emission in wetlands. Plant manipulations were conducted in an organic rich (JB-organic) and a mineral rich (JB-mineral) site in a tidal freshwater wetland to determine if plant removal impacted archaeal populations. In concert, a suite of process-based measurements also determined the effects of plant removal on rates of methanogenesis and Fe-reduction. The microbial populations were analyzed with clone libraries of the SSU ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene from selected plots, and terminal restriction length polymorphism (tRFLP) of the SSU rRNA and the methyl-coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) gene. Overall, methanogenesis dominated anaerobic carbon mineralization at both sites during the most active growing season. A total of 114 SSU rRNA clones from four different plots revealed a diversity of Euryarchaeota including representatives of the Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales and Thermoplasmatales. The clone libraries were dominated by the Thaumarchaeota, accounting for 65 % of clones, although their diversity was low. A total of 112 tRFLP profiles were generated from 56 samples from 25 subplots; the patterns for both SSU rRNA and mcrA showed little variation between sites, either with plant treatment or with the growing season. Overall these results suggest that wetland soil archaeal populations were resilient to changes in the associated surface plant communities. The work also revealed the presence of novel, mesophilic Thaumarchaeota of unknown metabolic function.

AB Here we present results from a field experiment in a sub-arctic wetland near Abisko, northern Sweden, where the permafrost is currently disintegrating with significant vegetation changes as a result. During one growing season we investigated the fluxes of CO(2) and CH(4) and how they were affected by ecosystem properties, i.e., composition of species that are currently expanding in the area (Carex rotundata, Eriophorum vaginatum and Eriophorum angustifolium), dissolved CH(4) in the pore water, substrate availability for methane producing bacteria, water table depth, active layer, temperature, etc. We found that the measured gas fluxes over the season ranged between: CH(4) 0.2 and 36.1 mg CH(4) m(-2) h(-1), Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) -1000 and 1250 mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1) (negative values meaning a sink of atmospheric CO(2)) and dark respiration 110 and 1700 mg CO(2) m(-2) h(-1). We found that NEE, photosynthetic rate and CH(4) emission were affected by the species composition. Multiple stepwise regressions indicated that the primary explanatory variables for NEE was photosynthetic rate and for respiration and photosynthesis biomass of green leaves. The primary explanatory variables for CH(4) emissions were depth of the water table, concentration of organic acid carbon and biomass of green leaves. The negative correlations between pore water concentration and emission of CH(4) and the concentrations of organic acid, amino acid and carbohydrate carbon indicated that these compounds or their fermentation by-products were substrates for CH(4) formation. Furthermore, calculation of the radiative forcing of the species expanding in the area as a direct result of permafrost degradation and a change in hydrology indicate that the studied mire may act as an increasing source of radiative forcing in future.

AB At the Prince Edward Islands, temperatures have increased by approximately 1 degrees C over the past 40 years, accompanied by a decline in precipitation. This ha's led to a reduction in the peat moisture content of mires and higher growing season ''warmth''. The temperature- and moisture-sensitive sedge, Uncinia compacta R. Pr. (Cyperaceae), has consequently increased its aerial cover on Prince Edward Island, but harvesting of seeds by feral house mice (up to 100% removed) has prevented this from happening on Marion Island. Such extensive use of resources suggests that prey switching may be taking place at Marion Island. Seat analyses revealed that mice are not only eating ectemnorhinine weevils to a greater extent than found in previous studies of populations at Marion Island, but that they also prefer larger weevils (+/- 6 mm). A decrease in body size of preferred weevil prey species [Bothrometopus randi Jeannel and Ectemnorhinus similis C.O. Waterhouse (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)] has taken place on Marion Island (1986-1992), but not on Prince Edward Island. This appears to be a result of increased predation on weevils. In addition, adults of the prey species, E. similis are relatively more abundant on Prince Edward Island than adults of the smaller congener E. marioni Jeannel, and could not be found on Marion Island in the late austral summer of 1991. These results not only provide support for previous hypotheses of the effect of global warming on mouse-plant-invertebrate interactions on the Prince Edward Islands, but also provide limited evidence for the first recorded case of predator-mediated speciation. They also show that the interaction of human-induced changes operating at different scales may have profound consequences for local systems.

AB The Lateglacial and Early Holocene vegetation history of the northern Wetterau and Amoneburger Basin, two intra-montane basins in Hessen, central-west Germany, is reconstructed by means of pollen and macrofossil analyses. Regional pollen assemblage zones are defined for the Lateglacial and Early Holocene. After calibration of the radiocarbon dates and establishment of age/depth relationships, the ages of the pollen zone boundaries are calculated. The regional vegetation changes correlate closely with the major fluctuations in the delta O-18 curve of the Greenland ice cores spanning the same time period. During the early Lateglacial, the open herbaceous vegetation with dwarf shrubs in the northern Wetterau was replaced by woodlands. Initially these woodlands consisted of birch, but after the immigration of pine, mixed forests of pine and birch developed. Soon after its immigration pine became dominant and pine woodlands largely replaced the birch forests. Only on the locally wetter substrates of the river floodplain did Betula stands persist. Gradually the importance of herbaceous communities declined and the pine woodlands lost their open character. During the Lateglacial two regressive phases in the vegetation succession are reflected in the data which are equated with the Older- and Younger Dryas biozones. At the beginning of the Younger Dryas, the forest-limit was lowered and the importance of herbaceous communities increased. Later, pine woodlands thinned and Ericales became part of the vegetation, indicating the development of more acid, nutrient-poor soils. A subdivision of the Younger Dryas biozone into a wetter, colder first part and a drier, warmer second part is suggested. At the beginning of the Early Holocene, pine woodlands became more closed and soils more stabilised. The transition between the Younger Dryas and Preboreal biozones is indicated by a lithological change to organic (-rich) deposits. Betula stands persisted on the locally wetter substrates of the fluvial plains. At the end of the early Preboreal, there was an extension of Betula stands on the river floodplains. This is interpreted as a phase in which climate was temporarily wetter, perhaps a reflection of a short-term climatic oscillation, the so-called Preboreal oscillation. During the Preboreal biozone, ferns became more important in the local vegetation of the mires, and later during the Boreal they formed the undergrowth of swamp forests. During the Boreal biozone, a major expansion of hazel took place in both areas. On the hills and slopes of the northern Wetterau and the Amoneburger Basin, open pine forests and hazel scrub developed with grasses and Pteridium in the field layer. In the river valleys, pine forests were replaced by deciduous mixed forests with oak, elm and later also with lime. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Southernmost Patagonia, located at the relatively narrow passage between Antarctica and South America, is a highly sensitive region for recording meridional and zonal changes in the pattern of oceanic and atmospheric circulation. The island of Isla de los Estados, situated at 54.5 degrees S, 64 degrees W, east of Argentinean Tierra del Fuego, provides an exceptional possibility, to investigate terrestrial records of atmospheric conditions in an oceanic setting during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. Here we present geochemical and diatom analyses from 10600 to c. 1500 cal BP of one sequence (LGB) with peat, lake sediments and lagoon deposits at the northern coast of the island, and a lake sediment sequence (CAS) 3 km further inland. The data comprise TC, TN, loss on ignition analyses and continuous XRF scanning as well as age-depth modeling based on AMS-C-14 dating on both cores. Diatom analysis of the CAS record complements the geochemical proxies. During the Holocene, our two sites have been impacted by two different forcings: changes in the regional climate regime largely influenced by the varying strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies (SHW), while relative sea-level changes affected the deposits of the coastal site. In concert with the onset of the Antarctic thermal optimum, our data suggest fairly warm conditions and the establishment of denser peat and forest vegetation on the island c. 10600 cal BP. Between 8500 and 4500 cal BP geochemistry and diatoms from the CAS record indicate stronger Westerlies at this latitude, which means higher wind speed or higher storm frequency and more precipitation, resulting in more pronounced surface run-off. After 4500 cal BP, the geochemical proxies and large changes in diatom assemblages indicate a decrease in precipitation, weaker winds and possibly cooler conditions, probably as an effect of weaker SHW and/or a latitudinal shift. The depositional environment of CAS changed from gyttja to peat around 1000 cal BP. At LGB, the onset of gyttja sedimentation around 7900 cal BP shows that the former wet land with peat accumulation had become a lake with a fairly rapid sedimentation. The chemical data from LGB imply a gradually increasing marine influence, probably as an effect of both rising sea level and increased impact of storms and maximum high tides. After a marine high-stand during the mid-Holocene, the LGB site returned into a peat bog again around 3400 cal BP. Our data suggest that since then relative sea level first dropped back below present sea level followed by a rise to present day sea level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Using organic amendments to stabilize sand-based athletic fields during

SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL

AB Athletic fields often use sand-based root zones for improved drainage. Sand-based root zones may have stability issues if turfgrass is not fully established. Our objective was to use organic amendments to improve the stability of sand-based fields during the turfgrass establishment period and avoid overuse of inorganic materials, which have negative effects. Coconut coir, peat, or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw at 1% organic material, peat at 2% organic material, and an inorganic stabilizing fiber, StaLok were tested, in the top 10 cm of the root zone of a Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) playing surface. In addition, rates of wheat straw, up to 2.5% organic matter were tested. Surface hardness (G(max)), volumetric water content, traction, penetration resistance, and visual quality were measured 2-4 mo after construction of the plots. Surface hardness was greatest in the inorganic stabilizer (51.7-61.7 g) and the wheat straw treatments (49.7-55.9 g). The kinetic penetration had no differences between the wheat straw (33.78-51.10 kPa) and the StaLok fibers (34.99-56.23 kPa). The results showed that it was possible to use up to 2% straw to increase the resistance to deformation and increase soil moisture while keeping acceptable visual quality and the surface hardness below 80 g. The organic matter from straw degraded faster than peat and after 4 mo of the growing season <1.5% remained. Wheat straw could be used to stabilize sand-based fields as an organic alternative to inorganic fibers.

AB The response of free polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) in needles of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) to varying needle potassium concentrations was investigated in two potassium fertilization experiments on drained peatlands. A significant negative correlation was observed between putrescine and potassium concentrations in needles. Putrescine responded more sensitively to decreasing needle K concentrations during the growing season than during the winter. Putrescine accumulation started when needle potassium concentrations were above 5.5 mg g(dw)-1 in summer and above 5.0 mg g(dw)-1 in winter. A decrease in needle potassium concentrations below 4.3 mg g(dw)-1 in summer and below 3.5 mg g(dw)-1 in winter resulted in an exponential increase in putrescine concentrations. Putrescine accumulation was initiated well above the needle potassium concentrations generally considered indicative of deficiency. The exponential increase in putrescine concentrations in winter occurred within the range of needle potassium concentrations that has been identified as indicating severe potassium deficiency.

AB The aim of this study is to interpret the palaeoenvironmental conditions established during the formation of several lignite seams at the Mavropigi deposit, Ptolemais, Greece (corehole MAK-48). In nine representative lignite samples, ash contents, as well as the contents of the elements C, H, N, O, and S were determined. Polished block sections from the same samples were examined under the microscope. The ash contents (750 degrees C) of the studied lignite seams range between 10-29% (on dry basis). The contents of C, H, N, and O display values between 36-55%, 2.4-4.6%, 0.7-2%, and 21-37.5%, respectively, while S contents do not exceed 1.4%. Huminite is the prevailing maceral group (87-95%). All the samples, except No. 35, display a distinct prevalence in detrohuminite maceral subgroup (up to 69 vol%, mmf). Liptinite and inertinite maceral groups show low contents, which do not exceed 9% and 7%, respectively. The Mavropigi lignites are medium to low grade coals and can be regarded as peat to lignite in terms of thermal maturity. The studied lignite seams formed in fens, possibly from herbaceous plants under limnotelmatic regime. During peat deposition, conditions were very moist and intense reducing with increased bacterial activity. The ratio of plant growth and peat accumulation versus rise of water table due to the subsidence rate was not well balanced. As a result, the petrographical composition of the Mavropigi lignites is related either to a long residence time of the organic matter in the acrotelm or to a herbaceous vegetation origin.

AB Considerable progress has been made in ecological and evolutionary genetics with studies demonstrating how genes underlying plant and microbial traits can influence adaptation and even 'extend' to influence community structure and ecosystem level processes. Progress in this area is limited to model systems with deep genetic and genomic resources that often have negligible ecological impact or interest. Thus, important linkages between genetic adaptations and their consequences at organismal and ecological scales are often lacking. Here we introduce the Sphagnome Project, which incorporates genomics into a long-running history of Sphagnum research that has documented unparalleled contributions to peatland ecology, carbon sequestration, biogeochemistry, microbiome research, niche construction, and ecosystem engineering. The Sphagnome Project encompasses a genus-level sequencing effort that represents a new type of model system driven not only by genetic tractability, but by ecologically relevant questions and hypotheses.

AB Natural riparian forest wetlands are known to be effective in their ability to remove nitrate by denitrification and sediments with attached phosphorus via sedimentation. On the other hand, litter input and decomposition is a process of crucial importance in cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus in a forest ecosystem.
   In this study we investigated the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the alder fen ecosystem through leaf litter and its decomposition and the removal capacity of nitrogen and phosphorus by measuring denitrification and sedimentation in the alder fen.
   We found an average input of leaf litter during fall 1998 of 226 g m(-2) yr(-1) DW with nutrient concentration of 0.17% P and 1.6% N. This means a yearly input of 0.4 g m(-2) yr(-1) P and 3.6 g m(-2) yr(-1) N. The decomposition of leaf litter using litter bags with small and large mesh size resulted in bags with macroinvertebrates (large mesh size) and without macroinvertebrates (small mesh size). After 57 days the litter bags with macroinvertebrates had a decomposition rate of 79%.
   Denitrification was measured in May and June of 1997 using the acetylene inhibition technique on intact soil cores and slurry-experiments. The average annual denitrification rate was 0.2 g m(-2) yr(-1) N using data from the core experiments. The denitrification rate was higher after addition of nitrate, indicating that denitrification in the riparian alder fen is mainly controlled by nitrate supply.
   The sedimentation rate in the investigated alder fen ranged from 0.47 kg m(-2) yr(-1) DW to 4.46 kg m(-2) yr(-1) DW in 1998 depending on the study site and method we used. Sedimentation rates were lower in newly designed plate traps than in cylinder traps. The alder fen also showed lower rates than the adjacent creek Briese. Average phosphorus removal rate was 0.33 g m(-2) yr(-1) P.
   Input sources for the surface water of the alder fen are sediment mineralization and decomposition of leaf litter; output sources are sedimentation and denitrification. This study showed that a nutrient input of 24.58 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) N, 8.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) P and 419 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) DOC into the surface water of the alder fen is possible. Alder fens cannot improve water quality of an adjacent river system. This is only true for a nearly pristine alder fen with the hydrology of 10 months flooded conditions and 2 months non-flooding conditions a year.

   LOGGING RESIDUE; NITROUS-OXIDE; CO2 EXCHANGE; WATER-VAPOR; N2O FLUXES;
   TEMPERATURE
AB The most common forest management method in Fennoscandia is rotation forestry, including clear-cutting and forest regeneration. In clear-cutting, stem wood is removed and the logging residues are either removed or left on site. Clear-cutting changes the microclimate and vegetation structure at the site, both of which affect the site's carbon balance. Peat soils with poor aeration and high carbon densities are especially prone to such changes, and significant changes in greenhouse gas exchange can be expected. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy fluxes with the eddy covariance method for 2 years (April 2016-March 2018) after clear-cutting a drained peatland forest. We observed a significant rise (23 cm) in the water table level and a large CO2 source (first year: 3086 +/- 148 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1); second year: 2072 +/- 124 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). These large CO2 emissions resulted from the very low gross primary production (GPP) following the removal of photosynthesizing trees and the decline of ground vegetation, unable to compensate for the decomposition of logging residues and peat. During the second summer (June-August) after the clear-cutting, GPP had already increased by 96% and total ecosystem respiration decreased by 14% from the previous summer. The mean daytime ratio of sensible to latent heat flux decreased after harvesting from 2.6 in May 2016 to 1.0 in August 2016, and in 2017 it varied mostly within 0.6-1.0. In April-September, the mean daytime sensible heat flux was 33% lower and latent heat flux 40% higher in 2017, probably due to the recovery of ground vegetation that increased evapotranspiration and albedo of the site. In addition to CO2 and energy fluxes, we measured methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes with manual chambers. After the clear-cutting, the site turned from a small CH4 sink into a small source and from N2O neutral to a significant N2O source. Compared to the large CO2 emissions, the 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) of the CH4 emissions was negligible. Also, the GWP100 due to increased N2O emissions was less than 10% of that of the CO2 emission change.

AB Background Families of farmer pesticide applicators have unusual opportunities for exposure, directly or indirectly, to pesticides. these exposures are not well characterized.
   Methods Subjects were 26,793 licensed private pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study, a cohort study being conducted in Iowa and North Carolina Questionnaires were completed by the applicators and their spouses.
   Results Many indirect exposure opportunities exist;for example, 21% of homes are within 50 yards of pesticide mixing areas, 27% of applicators stare pesticides in their homes and 94% of clothing worn for pesticide work is washed in the same machine as other laundry Direct exposure opportunities also occur; for example, 51% of wives of applicators worked in the fields in the last growing season, 40% of wives have ever mired or applied pesticides, and over half of children aged II or more do farm chores.
   Discussion/Conclusions The extent of the opportunities for exposure of family members of farmer pesticide applicators makes studies of their health important. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.dagger

AB In this study, we present summertime concentrations and fluxes of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) measured at a sub-arctic wetland in northern Sweden using a disjunct eddy-covariance (DEC) technique based on a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). The vegetation at the site was dominated by Sphagnum, Carex and Eriophorum spp. The measurements reported here cover a period of 50 days (1 August to 19 September 2006), approximately one half of the growing season at the site, and allowed to investigate the effect of day-to-day variation in weather as well as of vegetation senescence on daily BVOC fluxes, and on their temperature and light responses. The sensitivity drift of the DEC system was assessed by comparing H3O+-ion cluster formed with water molecules (H3O+(H2O) at m37) with water vapour concentration measurements made using an adjacent humidity sensor, and the applicability of the DEC method was analysed by a comparison of sensible heat fluxes for high frequency and DEC data obtained from the sonic anemometer. These analyses showed no significant PTR-MS sensor drift over a period of several weeks and only a small flux-loss due to high-frequency spectrum omissions. This loss was within the range expected from other studies and the theoretical considerations. Standardised (20 degrees C and 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PAR) summer isoprene emission rates found in this study of 329 mu g Cm-2 (ground area) h(-1) were comparable with findings from more southern boreal forests, and fen-like ecosystems. On a diel scale, measured fluxes indicated a stronger temperature dependence than emissions from temperate or (sub) tropical ecosystems. For the first time, to our knowledge, we report ecosystem methanol fluxes from a sub-arctic ecosystem. Maximum daytime emission fluxes were around 270 mu g m(-2) h(-1) (ca. 100 mu g Cm-2 h(-1)), and during most nights small negative fluxes directed from the atmosphere to the surface were observed.

AB The seasonal fluctuation of chitin dynamics in fresh water was studied in a mesotrophic bog and a hypereutrophic lake in Japan.  The metabolic rates of chitin were higher in more eutrophic water.  Thus, the chitin turnover rate during summer was one order of magnitude greater in the hypereutrophic lake than in the mesotrophic bog.  However, the steady-state oscillation of basal chitin stock averaged approximately 200 mg C m-2 in both ecosystems.  The production rate of detrital chitin was higher than the decomposition rate in the mesotrophic bog.

AB Part 1 of this review synthesizes recent research on status and climate vulnerability of freshwater and saltwater wetlands, and their contribution to addressing climate change (carbon cycle, adaptation, resilience). Peatlands and vegetated coastal wetlands are among the most carbon rich sinks on the planet sequestering approximately as much carbon as do global forest ecosystems. Estimates of the consequences of rising temperature on current wetland carbon storage and future carbon sequestration potential are summarized. We also demonstrate the need to prevent drying of wetlands and thawing of permafrost by disturbances and rising temperatures to protect wetland carbon stores and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services. Preventing further wetland loss is found to be important in limiting future emissions to meet climate goals, but is seldom considered. In Part 2, the paper explores the policy and management realm from international to national, subnational and local levels to identify strategies and policies reflecting an integrated understanding of both wetland and climate change science. Specific recommendations are made to capture synergies between wetlands and carbon cycle management, adaptation and resiliency to further enable researchers, policy makers and practitioners to protect wetland carbon and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services.

AB Pollen analysis from a peat-bog sequence located at 50 degrees 24' S, 72 degrees 42' W in the Subantarctic forest - Patagonian steppe ecotone gives information about vegetation and climate changes in Southwestern Patagonia since the glacier retreat. After 11000 cal YF BP a change from grass steppe to open Nothofagus forest indicates that climatic conditions became rapidly warmer. Development of a closed Nothofagus forest between 5800 and 3200 cal yr BP is interpreted as precipitation increase. During the late Holocene colder climate conditions prevail in response to Neoglacial events. After ca 3000 cal yr BP Nothofagus forest became opener, and after 800 cal yr BP grass steppe expanded. Changes in the forest-steppe ecotone composition as well as the ecotone longitudinal shifts suggest changes in temperature and precipitation. Present-day mean annual precipitation between 300 and 400 mm is associated with grass steppe, and 500-600 mm with a greater forest representation. During the last century, low presence of forest in the area may be related to European settlement and repeated flooding caused by periodic advances of Perito Moreno glacier. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The origin and distribution of twelve potentially Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs; As, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, and U) identified in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments were examined in relation to the maceral composition of the Al bed (Paleocene, Calvert Bluff Formation, Wilcox Group) of the Calvert mine in east-central Texas. The 3.2 m-thick Al bed was divided into nine incremental channel samples (7 lignite samples and 2 shaley coal samples) on the basis of megascopic characteristics. Results indicate that As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Sb, and U are strongly correlated with ash yield and are enriched in the shaley coal samples. We infer that these elements are associated with inorganic constituents in the coal bed and may be derived from a penecontemporaneous stream channel located several kilometers southeast of the mining block. Of the HAPs elements studied, Mn and Hg are the most poorly correlated to ash yield. We infer an organic association for Mn; Hg may be associated with pyrite. The rest of the trace elements (Be, Co, and Se) are weakly correlated with ash yield. Further analytical work is necessary to determine the mode of occurrence for these elements. Overall, concentrations of the HAPs elements are generally similar to or less than those reported in previous studies of lignites of the Wilcox Group, east-central region, Texas. Petrographic analysis indicates the following ranges in composition for the seven lignite samples: liptinites (5-8%), huminites (88-95%), and inertinites (trace amounts to 7%). Samples from the middle portion of the Al bed contain abundant crypto-eugelinite compared to the rest of the samples; this relationship suggests that the degradation of plant material was an important process during the development of the peat mire. With the exception of Hg and Mn, relatively low levels of the HAPs elements studied are found in the samples containing abundant crypto-eugelinite, We infer that the peat-forming, environment for this portion of the coal bed was very wet with minimal detrital input. Relatively high concentrations of crypto-humotelinite were found in samples from the top and base of the coat bed. The presence of abundant crypto-humotelinite in this part of the coal bed suggests the accumulation of wood-rich peat under conditions conducive to a high degree of tissue preservation in the peat mires. Although several of the trace elements (Be, Co, Ni, and Sb) exhibit enrichment in these samples, they are not necessarily chemically associated with humotelinite. We infer that these elements, with the exception of Be, are possibly associated with deposition of the roof and floor rock of the coal bed; however, further analytical work would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Beryllium may have an organic origin. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The paper summarizes and evaluates the results of Pb-210, Cs-137 and Am-241 analysis on 37 recent ombrotrophic peat profiles. From these and previously published data, it is concluded that radiometric measurements alone cannot be relied on to give an accurate chronology of peat accumulation. Where constrained by profiles of Am-241 activity in the upper part and one or more pollen-dated horizons below this, Pb-210 can provide good chronologies of peat accumulation provided the constraint does not displace the calculated Pb-210 dates by more than c. 10%. Profiles of Cs-137 activity, in most cases, fail to contribute significantly to dating recent peat. At somewhat degraded sites, the residual dry mass of peat representing the last c. 150 years is reduced. Further analysis of well-dated profiles suggests that this may reflect loss of catolelm peat newly exposed to aerobic decomposition processes after a fall in water table. Several mechanisms are proposed for the displacement and net loss of lead (including Pb-210) from peat profiles.

DE organic soils; water retention curve; peat density; ash content of peat
AB The water retention curve (WRC), density, botanical composition, and ash contents were determined for high-ash lowmoor peat soils (Rheic Sapric Histosols) developing on the floodplain of the Yakhroma River (Moscow oblast) from the herb-hypnum and hypnum peat enriched in carbonates, agromineral peat soils (Rheic Drainic Sapric Histosols (Mineralic)), and peat soils developed from woody peat underlain by herb, sedge, and woody peat layers (Rheic Sapric Histosols (Lignic)). The WRC was determined by capillarimetric method in the range of water pressure from 0 to 80-90 kPa. For the studied peat soils, the WRC represents a close to linear dependence of the water content on the water pressure in semilogarithmic scale. In contrast to mineral soils, a characteristic point of the air-entry pressure is virtually absent on the WRC of peat soils. The WRC of peat largely depended on their density: denser peat samples were characterized by a higher water content at the same water pressure, which attests to the increased water retention capacity. An increase in the degree of decomposition of peat and its ash content also leads to the rise in the water retention capacity, but the effect of these factors is considerably smaller than the effect of peat density.

AB Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a thermo-chemical process, which converts biomass into a coal-like product, referred to as hydrochar. Hydrochars have low pH and salinity, a high water holding capacity and cation exchange capacity, and thus are correlated to the requirements of horticultural substrates. However, germination- and growth-inhibiting effects were frequently observed in experiments using untreated fresh hydrochars. In this study we investigated the suitability of biological pretreated co-composted hydrochar substrates as growing media for horticultural crops. Hydrochars made from residue feedstocks, such as beer draft and green cuttings, were used to perform seed germination experiments with Chinese cabbage (Brassica raga ssp. Pekinensis) on fresh, untreated and pretreated hydrochar-compost substrates and ii) pretreated hydrochar-compost substrates in a) different mixing ratios (10, 30 and 50% hydrochar), and b) using different hydrochars in a fixed mixing ratio of 50:50. Moreover, growth experiments with French marigold (Tagetes patula) for a growing season on the co-composted hydrochar substrates were performed. As reference substrates, a peat-based gardening substrate and a compost were used. Germination rate and plant growth were higher for co-composted substrates than on untreated freshly mixed substrates. Growth of French marigold increased with the amount of hydrochar in the mixtures up to equal growth quality compared to a peat-based gardening substrate. Substrate properties including salinity, density and pH value influenced the plant growth as well. The type of hydrochar had only a slight influence.

DT Article
AB We grew Azospirillum brasilense biomass in fed-batch culture for 28 h using succinic acid as a C source and liquid NH3 as N source. Viable cell concentration reached 1-3 x 10(10) CFU ml(-1) after 28 h. Ground or granular peat, serving as carriers for the bacteria, maintained the highest number of A. brasilense compared to vermiculite, talcum powder, basalt granules or bentonite. A. brasilense viable counts declined from about 10(10) CFU g(-1) peat to 10(5)-10(6) CFU g(-1) peat after 6 months. A pot system for evaluating the effect of A. brasilense inoculants on plant growth in greenhouses demonstrated that application of peat-carrier containing 10(8) CFU g(-1) peat, significantly increased panicle length and dry weight of Setaria italica and ear and kernel weight of maize (Zea mays L). Highest growth promotion effects on maize were observed when using A. brasilense cells containing 40% polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and by applying the pear inoculant 2 cm below the maize seed.

AB Background concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, Pb, Hg, Cd, Ba, Sr, and Sc) in soils and bottom sediments were determined for the background and anthropogenically disturbed (oil and gas extraction) areas in the north of Western Siberia on the basis of long-term studies (1993-2017). It was found that the soils are characterized by relatively low concentrations of heavy metals. The major factors affecting the variability of the chemical composition of the environmental components are the lithological and chemical composition of the parent materials and the zonal-azonal geochemical differentiation related to peat accumulation. The statistical analysis and the method of ranked geochemical spectra suggested that background element concentrations should be separately determined for organic soil horizons, for mineral (illuvial) horizons in coarse-textured and heavy-textured soils, and for peatlands. Minimum concentrations of most of the studied heavy metals were determined in peatlands: they were 2-8 times lower than the concentrations of these metals in the clayey and loamy illuvial horizons. Mercury and cadmium were the exceptions: their concentrations in the peatlands were 3-4 times higher than those in the illuvial mineral horizons. Background metal concentrations in bottom sediments were separately calculated for three categories: clay and peaty clay sediments, silts, and fine-grained sands. Metals concentrations in clay sediments were significantly higher than those in sandy sediments: by 11 times for Fe and Mn; by 8.5 times for Ni; by 6.5 times for Co; and by 5 times for Zn, Cu, Cr, and V. The concentrations of metals were determined by the ICP MS method. The obtained data on the background concentrations of heavy metals can be recommended for the assessment of technogenic impact on local soils and bottom sediments in the course of the environmental monitoring.

AB Organic soils in boreal ecosystems and peatlands represent a huge global carbon pool and their composition strongly affects soil properties. Nevertheless, the characterization of soil organic matter (SOM) molecular composition, which is essential for elucidating soil carbon processes and turnover, is not easily achieved, and further advances in the area are greatly needed. Two dimensional (2D) liquid state H-1-C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been used on dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) extracts of SOM to achieve molecular level characterization, with signals from many identifiable molecular groups observable. Here we show that a simple and fast sample preparation allows acquisition of 2D H-1-C-13 NMR spectra from extracts of plant litter and organic layers in boreal ecosystems, with fast data acquisition. Our 2D NMR spectra revealed several differences in the DMSO extracts of different tree litter samples, O-horizons of forest soil, peat-forming moss (Sphagnum) and peat. The results mirror established differences between OM in soils and litter of different forest ecosystems (e.g. between deciduous and coniferous litter) but also provide indications for research to untangle previously conflicting results (e.g. cutin degradation in soil or carbohydrate degradation in peat). Thus, combination of 2D NMR methods can greatly improve analysis of litter composition and SOM composition, thereby facilitating the elucidation of their roles in biogeochemical and ecological processes that are critical for foreseeing feedback mechanisms for SOM turnover as a result of global environmental change.

AB Typical values of plant available nitrogen (N) from animal manures are provided in fertilizer recommendation schemes. However, only a few attempts have been made thus far to study the variation in these values among contrasting soil types. The objective of this study was to examine the interactions between animal manure and soil types on N mineralization and total plant N recovery (shoots + roots) during one growing season.
   A pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during a growth period of 180 days. Experimental treatments included solid cattle manure (SCM), cattle slurry (CS) and poultry manure (PM), all applied to sandy, clay and peat soils sown with perennial ryegrass. Total N application rate was 120 kg ha(-1).
   There were clear interactions (P < 0.05) between the manure and soil types on N mineralization and total plant N recovery. For each manure type, both parameters followed the pattern (P < 0.01): peat > sandy > clay. In case of the peat soil, net mineralization of the applied organic N was on average 90 % from PM, 39 % from SCM and 26 % from CS. However, in the clay soil a positive net N mineralization occurred only from PM (42 %). Besides, significant proportions of the applied mineral N from SCM (17 %) and CS (35 %) were immobilized in this soil type. Consequently, apparent total plant N recovery was highest in the peat soil with values of 80, 57 and 50 % from PM, CS and SCM, respectively. In contrast, these values were only 57, 28 and 15 % for the clay soil.
   It is concluded that wide variations do exist in the extent of net N mineralization and plant N recovery from a given animal manure type when applied to diverging soil types. This indicates the need for more soil-specific manure fertilizer recommendations.

AB Due to the complexity of soil freeze/thaw processes and a variety of factors affecting pollutant removal in treatment wetlands, laboratory pilot systems are powerful tools offering a rare opportunity to observe processes that have a significant impact on year-round purification. This paper describes the design, construction, monitoring and operation of two replicate pilot peat-based wetlands subjected to two simulated freeze-thaw cycles. Undisturbed peat soil and pre-treated gold mine process wastewater were collected from a full-scale treatment wetland operating at a mining site in Northern Finland. The wastewater (pH similar to 7.8, electric conductivity similar to 3.6 mS/cm) contained a mix of metals/metalloids (e.g. arsenic 12 mu g/L, antimony 19 mu g/L) and other contaminants e.g. sulphate (similar to 2 g/L). Fluctuations in removal efficiency of target compounds due to freezing and thawing conditions were observed. Overall, removal of sulphate and arsenic decreased during frost periods, while removal of antimony increased. Monitoring data from the full-scale treatment wetland were used to assess the representativeness of the results obtained. Comparisons of seasonal variations in pollutant concentrations in outflow samples from the full-scale wetland and those measured in the pilot wetlands revealed similar fluctuations in removal efficiency during frost and frost-free periods, suggesting that the pilot wetlands simulated the real system rather well. Carefully designed pilot systems can thus be valuable tools for assessing the effect of harsh winter conditions on wetland processes and operation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reconstructing historical hydrologic and vegetation conditions can provide useful insights into the mechanisms underlying peatland development and can be used to construct baselines for peatland restoration. In this study, we present numerous physical and biological indices for a 4000-year core from the Honghe National Natural Reserve (HE), a dish-like depression peatland in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. The history of vegetation change was reconstructed by combining plant macrofossils and pollen data from the core, and the water level changes were reconstructed through a multi-proxy study of plant macrofossils, charcoal, stable carbon isotopes, testate amoebae, sediment grain size, loss on ignition, humification degree and magnetic susceptibility. We found that the HE peatland featured wet condition from 4000 to 3600 cal yr BP, which was in accordance with the extreme flooding event at 4.0 lea in northern China. Significant drier shifts were recorded at 3600 and 1200 cal yr BP, while significant wetter shifts were recorded at 2600 and 500 cal yr BP. Factor analysis were applied to all of the proxies to reduce the seven variables to two factors, and the biological indicators, such as plant macrofossils, charcoal and stable carbon isotopes, were found to be more sensitive than the other parameters to water level changes over the last 4000 years. Furthermore, the multi-proxy reconstruction of the wetness of the HE peatland resembles the pattern observed at other sites in Northeast China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last decades, Arctic landscapes have experienced intense warming leading to permafrost degradation and rapid ecosystem changes. Active layer thickening, widespread melting of ground ice and thermo-erosion have affected the mobilization of organic and mineral elements. While the carbon and nitrogen cycles are intensively studied, the soil weathering has been less documented. In the present study, we monitored the chemistry of soil capillary and gravitational pore waters, rainfall and stream waters daily during the growing season in two experimental sites under tussock tundra vegetation in the low-Arctic region, in Salluit (Nunavik, Canada). We aimed to investigate the seasonal thaw controls on the evolution of concentrations of major organic and inorganic elements in the active layer (i.e., seasonally thawed surface layers) of two permafrost soils (Cryosols) differing in parental materials: an ombrotrophic bog (i.e., Histic Cryosol) and post-glacial marine sediments continuously waterlogged (i.e., Turbic Cryosol). In the Histic Cryosol, the electrical conductivity was <100 mu S cm(-1) and Cl- and Na+ were the dominant soluble ions originating from atmospheric depositions. In the Turbic Cryosol, decarbonated in the first 40 cm, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were the dominant soluble ions in the capillary water reflecting the dissolution of soil minerals, while Cl- and SO42- dominated in gravitational water, illustrating inputs from uphill. In the two soils, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations as well as Mg/Na and Ca/Na increased with depth. Along summer, the soil pore water chemistry evolved with thaw front and water table depths in the two sites. Particularly in the Histic Cryosol, electrical conductivity, solute concentrations, Mg/Na and Ca/Na ratios increased with the thaw front deepening. Our observations suggest that the active layer thickening and increasing supra-permafrost flow contribution, expected to increase with Arctic warming, could lead to a shift in chemistry of pore waters in organic and mineral permafrost soils, differently depending on permafrost landform settings.

AB Recent evidence indicates that our current soil C stores may be already changing from carbon sinks to sources, with reported increasing C losses in both gaseous (soil respiration) and aqueous (dissolved organic carbon, DOC forms) across large areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Current debates have mainly focused on climatic variables; however, accounting for the abiotic and biotic interactions is required to enable better quantifications of C dynamics. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the interactive effects of temperature, moisture and dominant mesofauna (enchytraeids) changes on C losses by incubating root-free sieved soil samples from a peatland soil during 13 weeks at two temperature (14 and 19 C) and two moisture (85 and 60% WHC) treatments under laboratory conditions. Our results showed that neither temperature nor moisture and invertebrates had a significant effect on respiration rates. In contrast, under favourable moisture conditions, the temperature induced changes in enchytraeid population numbers resulted in more DOC being released from these soils, possibly linked to the positive effects of animal activities on iron mobilisation and buffering the pH of the soil solution. Our results also confirmed that moisture contents of 60% WHC could severely affect their population numbers in these organic soils and hence, the functioning of these vulnerable ecosystems. Importantly, in agreement with previous studies, availability of easily accessible C sources seems to be a critical factor in the progressive declines of soil respiration and DOC production rates over time. Taken these findings together it is possible to conclude that the combined action of abiotic factors and their influence on soil fauna populations plays a key role in controlling SOM decomposition rates of these peatland soils.

AB Nitrogen (N) fixation by N-2-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) is the primary N input to pristine ecosystems like boreal forests and subarctic and arctic tundra. However, the contribution by the various diazotrophs to habitat N-2 fixation remains unclear. We present results from in situ assessments of N-2 fixation of five diazotroph associations (with a legume, lichen, feather moss, Sphagnum moss and free-living) incorporating the ground cover of the associations in five typical habitats in the subarctic (wet and dry heath, polygon-heath, birch forest, mire). Further, we assessed the importance of soil and air temperature, as well as moisture conditions for N-2 fixation. Across the growing season, the legume had the highest total as well as the highest fraction of N-2 fixation rates at habitat level in the heaths (> 85 % of habitat N-2 fixation), whereas the free-living diazotrophs had the highest N-2 fixation rates in the polygon heath (56 %), the lichen in the birch forest (87 %) and Sphagnum in the mire (100 %). The feather moss did not contribute more than 15 % to habitat N-2 fixation in any of the habitats despite its high ground cover. Moisture content seemed to be a major driver of N-2 fixation in the lichen, feather moss and free-living diazotrophs. Our results show that the range of N-2 fixers found in pristine habitats contribute differently to habitat N-2 fixation and that ground cover of the associates does not necessarily mirror contribution.

   TREES; SOILS
AB British vegetation is estimated to contain 113.8 million tC, 80 per cent of which is in forests and woodlands (91.9 million tC). Sitka spruce plantations, although covering 21.4 per cent of the forest/woodland area, contain only 8.2 per cent of the forest/woodland carbon, because the plantations are young and have an average of only 14.1 tC ha(-1). Broadleaved woodlands in Britain have an average of 61.9 tC ha(-1) and contain 46.8 per cent of the total carbon in all vegetation. A breakdown is given of the carbon density (tC ha(-1)) and content of different tree species. A carbon density map of Britain highlights the concentration of carbon in the broadleaved woodlands in southern England and in the large conifer plantations in southern Scotland and northern England.
   Carbon storage in the trees, products, litter and soil can be evaluated in terms of long-term equilibrium storage or short-term rate of storage. These two components vary among forest types in Britain and globally. Plantations harvested at the time of maximum mean annual increment (MAI) will not store as much carbon as mature, old-growth forests on the same site unless they have long-lasting products and/or are very fast growing. Maximum equilibrium carbon storage is generally achieved by harvesting at the time of maximum MAI when the lifetime of products exceeds the time to maximum MAI. Undisturbed peatlands sequester CO2 and emit CH4, and may be greenhouse neutral. When peatlands are drained and planted with trees, they stop emitting CH4 and store carbon in the trees, forest litter, forest soil and wood products. However, these greenhouse gas 'gains' are offset by the oxidation to CO2 of the pear, and the gains are exceeded by CO2 losses when 20-40 cm depth of peat has been oxidized. Forests in Britain are currently sequestering 1.5-1.7 million tC a(-1) in trees, 0.3-0.5 tC a(-1) in litter and 0.5 million tC a(-1) in wood products, totalling about 2.5 million tC, equivalent to about 1.5 per cent of the carbon currently emitted by burning fossil fuels in the UK. In order to maintain the current forest carbon sink, the forest area needs to continue to expand at about 25000 ha a(-1) of upland conifers or 10000 ha a(-1) of poplars on good land.

AB Catchment-scale land-use change is recognised as a major threat to aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning globally. In the UK uplands rotational vegetation burning is practised widely to boost production of recreational game birds, and while some recent studies have suggested burning can alter river water quality there has been minimal attention paid to effects on aquatic biota. We studied ten rivers across the north of England between March 2010 and October 2011, five of which drained burned catchments and five from unburned catchments. There were significant effects of burning, season and their interaction on river macroinvertebrate communities, with rivers draining burned catchments having significantly lower taxonomic richness and Simpson's diversity. ANOSIM revealed a significant effect of burning on macroinvertebrate community composition, with typically reduced Ephemeroptera abundance and diversity and greater abundance of Chironomidae and Nemouridae. Grazer and collector-gatherer feeding groups were also significantly less abundant in rivers draining burned catchments. These biotic changes were associated with lower pH and higher Si, Mn, Fe and Al in burned systems. Vegetation burning on peatland therefore has effects beyond the terrestrial part of the system where the management intervention is being practiced. Similar responses of river macroinvertebrate communities have been observed in peatlands disturbed by forestry activity across northern Europe. Finally we found river ecosystem changes similar to those observed in studies of wild and prescribed forest fires across North America and South Africa, illustrating some potentially generic effects of fire on aquatic ecosystems.

AB Foliar litter is the main input of organic carbon to many soils, and thus litter decomposition processes are integral to our understanding of carbon dynamics in soil systems. Despite the short duration of the leaching phase of decomposition, a considerable amount of mass loss can occur providing a valuable energy source for microbes, and influencing leaf litter chemistry for subsequent microbial decomposition. At the same time, differences in plant species and their functional traits play a role in decomposition dynamics, particularly in consideration of shifting plant communities or changes in leaf chemistry under climate change. Here we investigate the short-term leaching decomposition dynamics of three boreal peatland plant species (Carex magellanica, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Sphagnum magellanicum) grown under ambient and elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. Litter chemistry was significantly different among all three plant species. In addition, plant tissues grown under elevated CO2 showed lower total C and total N than plants grown under ambient CO2. After leaching, however litter from plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions were not significantly different in total C values compared to plants grown under ambient CO2 conditions. Mass loss corresponded with the total dissolved organic carbon release across all species and was greatest in Chamaedaphne, a woody shrub; measures of carbon lability (SUVA(254)) were significantly greater in vascular plant species compared to Sphagnum moss. Mass loss was reduced in plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions, suggesting allocation to more non-soluble structural compounds. Placing our results within a climate change scenario where peatland plant community compositional shifts from mosses to graminoids and woody shrubs have been observed, we suggest that greater amounts of more labile carbon released from vascular plant species indicates a shift to more decomposable litters with the potential to stimulate microbial growth and activity.

AB The effects of changing climate and disturbance on forest water cycling are not well understood. In particular, bryophytes contribute significantly to forest evapotranspiration in poorly drained boreal forests, but few studies have directly measured this flux and how it changes with stand age and soil drainage. We measured bryophyte evaporation (E) in the field (in Canadian Picea mariana forests of varying ages and soil drainages) and under controlled laboratory conditions, and modelled daily E using site-specific meteorological data to drive a Penman-Monteith-based model. Field measurements of E averaged 0.37 mm day(-1) and ranged from 0.03 (Pleurozium schreberii in a 77-year-old dry stand) to 1.43 mm day(-1) (Sphagnum riparium in a 43-year-old bog). In the laboratory, moss canopy resistance (which ranged from similar to 0 to 1500 s m(-1)) was constant until a moss water content of similar to 6 g g(-1) and then climbed sharply with further drying; unexpectedly, no difference was observed between the three moss groups (feather mosses, hollow mosses and hummock mosses) tested. Modelled annual E ranged from 0.4 mm day(-1), in the well-drained stands, to similar to 1 mm day(-1) in the 43-year-old bog. The Penman-Monteith modelling approach used was relatively insensitive to most parameters but only explained 35% of the variability in field measurements. Bryophyte E was greater in bogs than in upland stands, was driven by low-lying mosses and varied with stand age only in the poorly drained stands; this suggests that bryophytes may provide a buffering effect to fire-driven changes in tree transpiration.

AB Lignites and fossil wood from two boreholes in the late Miocene Hausruck district (Alpine Foreland Basin, Austria) were investigated with respect to organic carbon and total sulfur contents, ash yields, maceral composition, organic geochemistry, and stable carbon isotope ratios.
   The lignites from the two sampled profiles differ in sulfur contents and petrography-based facies indicators (gelification index [GI], tissue preservation index [TPI]). The results point to drier and more acidic conditions in the part of the mire sampled at drill site Lukasberg, whereas the lignites from Kalletsberg formed under near neutral conditions due to a raised (ground) water table. The different depositional environments are supported by the paleogeographic positions of the boreholes: borehole Lukasberg is located within a paleo-valley, whereas borehole Kalletsberg is located at the deeper part of a basin situated south and southwest of the Hausruck area.
   Environmental changes with time within the mire are confirmed by the molecular composition of the soluble organic matter (SOM). Differences in pristane/phytane ratio, isomerisation of hopanes at position 17, concentrations of hopanes, and in the ratio of hopanes to hop-17(21)-enes are related to the extent of gelification of plant tissue, sulfur content and pH values, caused by differences in (ground) water table. The variable contents of individual terpenoid hydrocarbons derived from land plants indicate that angiosperms and conifers contribute to peat formation in the Hausruck district in variable proportions. Overall, angiosperm biomarkers slightly predominate. The tissue preservation index (TPI) within the Kalletsberg profile is probably governed by the proportion of decay-resistant conifers, as indicated by the correlation between TPI and biomarker composition of the coals.
   Correlations between delta(13)C values of the lignites (between - 24.9parts per thousand and - 27.4) and their non-hopanoid terpenoid composition indicate the major influence of changes in peat-forming vegetation on the carbon isotopic composition of the coals in the Hausruck district. Carbon isotope data of macrofossils are consistent with their taxonomical classification as conifers (delta(13)C between - 22.7parts per thousand and - 25.1parts per thousand) and angiosperms (delta(13)C between - 25.5parts per thousand and - 26.6parts per thousand), respectively. The delta(13)C data of the extracted cellulose reveal clear differences between fossil wood from gymnosperms (average delta(13)C= -21.0parts per thousand) and angiosperms (mean delta(13)C= -23.4parts per thousand).

AB The island of Isla de los Estados is situated at 54.5 degrees S, 64 degrees W, east of Argentinian Tierra del Fuego, and is located in a sensitive geographic position in relation to the zonal circulation between Antarctica and South America. Its terrestrial records of the last deglaciation, recording atmospheric conditions but within an oceanic setting, can help to clarify changes of regional circulation patterns, both atmospheric and marine. Here, we present geochemical analyses from 16-10 ka cal BP of a peat core from Lago Galvarne Bog at the northern coast of the island, and a lake sediment core from Laguna Cascada 3 kin further south. The data comprise TC, TN, loss on ignition analyses and continuous XRF scanning on both cores as well as age-depth modeling based on AMS-C-14 dating. Deglaciation and onset of peat formation in the coastal areas began before 16 ka cal BP followed by a rapid glacial retreat and the start of lacustrine sedimentation further inland. Data Suggest initially windy conditions with permafrost succeeded by gradually warmer and wetter conditions until ca 14.5 ka cal BP. The warming trend slows down until ca 13.5 ka cal BP, followed by arid conditions culminating around 12.8 ka cal BP. Our data suggest fairly warm conditions and the establishment of denser peat and forest vegetation ca 10.6 ka cal BP, contemporaneous with the onset of the Antarctic thermal optimum. This indicates large-scale shifts in the placement of zonal flow and the Westerlies at the beginning of the Holocene. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands in the Russian Forest Fund occupy more than 12 % of the country's territory exceeding 100 min ha. These are primarily afforested swamps with low-quality forest stands. A significant part of raised bogs is generally forestless. Meanwhile, about 60 % of the eutrophic and mesotrophic swamps are potentially rich. Here, only excess of water interferes with successful forest growth. The world forestry has accumulated wide experience in regulation of soil water retention through irrigation improvement and drainage. In Russia there are classic examples when stands of the 1st quality class grew in the large (several thousands of hectares) areas after irrigation improvement. One such case is the Kheynovskoye swamp with an area of over 2 ths. ha located in the Lisino training and experimental forest of the Saint-Petersburg State Forest Technical University and drained in 1847. However, there are enough cases of unsuccessful drainage. The better half of the drained swamps before drainage were grown over with forests. Irrigation improvement has turned around the growth conditions of all stands existed before drainage, but in poor eutrophic swamps forest growth is insufficient. The research purpose was to study brand new stands in the drained territory taking into account the whole formation cycle of the biotope and its change with time. In order to get that done, a pilot plot was laid out on a eutrophic-mcsotrophic treeless peat. where drainage was carried out using a frequent network of small grooves (furrows). They were dug with the help of a double moldboard (trench digger) and directed into the channels of the drainage network, thus providing for constant water drainage. Forest plantations were laid out on the layers formed along the furrows with the participation of the author. We had been assessing changes in the stand condition each 5-10 years for almost 60 years. The studies have shown that in the first years after removal of excess water and better soil warming, sedimentation and depletion of peat occurred. At a depth of 0.4-0.5 m in 20 years after planting the trees, the depth of peat decreased by almost 2 times. The living ground cover has changed under the influence of drainage and the developed stand. The initial (swamp) type of soil formation was replaced with soddy soil. High-quality heavy-producing plantation was formed. When comparing the parameters of the created artificial plantation with the stands of natural origin according to the growth course tables, it was found that the stock of the created stands at the age of 50 is almost twice higher than the stock of natural stands. It can be assumed that when growing wood pulp for its intended purposes in 100 years two yields can be harvested. Changes in peat soil have taken place during the last 50 years. The carbon (C) content decreased and the total nitrogen (N) content increased due to the intensive decomposition of peat, as evidenced by the decrease in the ratio of C:N. Structure developed in peat soil. The beginning of podzol-forming is noticed. Probably, the actual and hydrolytic acidity have increased due to the needle litter.

AB The role of the root plug as a nutrient source for newly planted seedlings was evaluated for one growing season on soil bioassays retrieved from a boreal forest site. Intact (control) and bare-rooted (peat plug removed) black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) seedlings reared in Jiffy pellets, some fertilized before ("spiked" with 60 mg N) or after (topdressed with 300 mg N) planting, were transplanted to potted soil blocks (bioassays) under greenhouse conditions. Compared with the intact control, bare-rooting alone reduced plant dry mass (16%) and N, P, and K (15%-25%) uptake, but increased these parameters (62%-101%) when combined with topdressing, suggesting that the root plug served as a crucial nutrient reserve soon after transplanting. Nutrient spiking or topdressing alone stimulated growth and nutrient uptake as well (35%-118%), but generated the largest response (81%-205%) when applied together. Mortality (7%-18%) occurred only with bare-rooting treatments. The responses reflected the sensitivity of seedlings to nutrient supply changes both in root plugs and in field soils. Nutrient spiking was more efficient in improving seedling performance than traditional topdressing because of reduced fertilizer requirements and closer availability of added nutrients for early root development.

AB The aim of the present study is to provide additional information about the properties and depositional environment of the Kipra lignite seam, which was deposited during the regressive stage of development of the Maritza-West basin. Petrographical and mineralogical data, along with ash yields and sulphur contents of 24 samples from a seam profile, have been used to study the vertical variation of the depositional settings during peat accumulation and subsequent coalification.
   The Kipra lignite is characterized by high ash yields and sulphur contents. It formed in a rheotrophic, low-lying mire with alkaline pH value. Vegetation with low preservation potential dominated within the palaeomire. During peat formation, frequent changes of the water level controlled the depositional environment. During the deposition of units 1 and 2, high water energy caused the transportation of high amounts of inorganic material into the mire, resulting in the formation of weakly gelified mineral-rich lignite. The organic matter from units 3 and 4 is characterized by enhanced gelification, which probably reflects the decreasing energy of the system. Good positive correlation between sulphur contents and the G1 values was established in units 4, indicating that the gelification of the tissues was probably mainly controlled by the bacterial activity. In contrast, the gelification of the samples from unit 3 of the Kipra seam was probably governed by the redox conditions. The organic matter deposited under relatively wet conditions, in which the thermal and oxidative destruction of the tissues, was limited.
   A variety of major, minor and accessory minerals are present in Maritza-West lignite. The mineral composition is dominated mainly by pyrite, gypsum and calcite, and to a lesser extent limonite, quartz, kaolinite, montmorillonite, illite, chlorite and plagioclase. Jarosite, hematite, halloysite, mica, K-feldspar, aragonite, siderite, and dolomite were also determined in very low concentrations. These minerals formed syngenetically and epigenetically. The syngenetic stage is characterized mainly by the formation of pyrite, carbonates, silicates and sulphates, whereas the Fe-oxyhydroxides, partially the carbonates and almost all silicates are of detrital origin. During the epigenetic stage, carbonates, sulphates, clay minerals, pyrite, and Fe-oxyhydroxides were formed. Alteration products like gypsum, jarosite, limonite, eblorite, kaolinite, illite, mica, and calcite were generated due to the transformation of detrital and authigenic minerals.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas accounting for 60% of the total greenhouse effect. Soil is a major source for atmospheric CO2. In the event of growing threats of global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions, reducing CO2 emission by sequestering C in the soil is of prime importance. Soil management practices like increasing soil organic carbon content, reduced tillage, manuring, residue incorporation, improving soil biodiversity, micro-aggregation and mulching can play an important role in sequestering C in soil.

AB The onset of peat accumulation in the Hot Weather Creek area (79-degrees-58'N-84-degrees-28'W) followed the postglacial marine emergence of the region. The physiographic context of the studied Holocene deposit suggests that peat initially accumulated in a depression south of early Ridge Lake. Polygons subsequently formed in that peat deposit. The draining of the lake took place as a result of downcutting of the deposit by the lake spillway. At the base of the 2.85 m sequence, macrofossil analysis reveals an open meadow dominated by grasses and sedges recording a pioneer stage that followed emersion. The physionomy of this meadow was subsequently modified by the formation of a low-centred polygon. Bryophytes colonized the resulting wet depression and a peat deposit developed. A series of mineral horizons occur throughout the deposit, indicating recurrent aeolian or alluvial activity during peat accumulation. These layers are associated with higher rates of peat decomposition.

AB Pre-Quaternary terrestrial climate records in which time has been calibrated using astronomical cycles are, with the exception of lacustrine proxies, poorly represented in the geological record. This omission is a significant gap in our knowledge of ancient climate systems. Here we present new evidence of orbital periodicities in an 18.3-m-thick late Paleocene coal and conclude that coal has the potential to provide continuous time-calibrated terrestrial climate data. Spectral analysis of changes in the relative proportions of vitrinite to inertinite, two environmentally sensitive coal macerals, reveals several characteristic frequencies, some of which display evidence of amplitude modulation every five to six cycles. Combining this observation with depositional time limitations derived from present-day rates of carbon accumulation in mires, we interpret the characteristic frequencies as resulting from precession and obliquity and their influence on oxidation and decay. Using the inferred precession component of the data to derive an internal time scale, we estimate that the Wyodak coal was deposited over a period of similar to414 k.y. with a long-term carbon sequestration rate of 29 g m(-2) yr(-1). The identification of an internal astronomical time scale in coal is an important step toward realizing the potential for coal to extend our high-resolution knowledge of Earth's terrestrial climate back to the formation of the first peat deposits at 360 Ma.

AB 1. In central Siberia Pinus sylvestris forests and bogs are common elements of the landscape and they show different functional behaviour in terms of energy and carbon exchanges.
   2. The two ecosystems show a remarkable difference in energy dissipation, with average Bowen ratios of 0.6 and 2.9, respectively.
   3. The alternation of bogs and forests with different energy partition at the surface could affect rainfall distribution and the disturbance regimes (lightening and fires) and drive the ecology of such a complex landscape.
   4. During summer, water shortage and poor nutrient conditions in the soil heavily affect carbon exchange rates of the regenerating forest (- 7.7 mmol m(-2) day(-1)). Consequently the bog becomes a significant dominant carbon sequestration element of this particular landscape with higher rates of carbon uptake (- 104.2 mmol m(-2) day(-1)).

AB Logging residue piles have been suggested to markedly increase the decomposition of the underlying peat soil leading to large carbon dioxide emissions. We aimed at scrutinizing this postulate with straightforward decomposition (mass loss) measurements. For the purpose, authentic soil organic matter (humus and peat) was incubated in mesh bags under piles and at control plots. The effect of piles was assumed to result from physical (shading and insulation on soil surface) and chemical-biological (leaching of nutrients and fresh organic matter) sources. To distinguish between the two, artificial piles of inorganic matter were established to mimic the bare physical effects. Enhancement of decomposition in the soil under the real and artificial piles was assessed by measuring the mass loss of cellulose strips.
   Logging residue piles had clear physical effects on soil: temperatures were lowered and their diurnal variation subdued, and relative humidity at the soil surface was higher. The effect on soil moisture was also evident, but more variable, including both decreases and increases. These effects, mimicked by the artificial piles, decreased rather than increased cellulose mass loss. As the real piles, on the other hand, increased mass loss, we conclude that logging residue piles may enhance decomposition in soil due to chemical-biological mechanisms.
   Also the results on humus and peat mass loss indicate that piles can both increase and decrease decomposition. Consistent, remarkable increase in mass loss was not observed. Thus, our results do not support the postulate of logging residue piles dramatically increasing decomposition of soil organic matter. Rather, they hint that the effect of logging residue piles on soil is an interplay of physical and chemical-biological effects and carbon transport via roots and fungi. To fully understand and quantify these effects, vertical C fluxes between piles and soil and horizontal C fluxes within soil need to be assessed in addition to decomposition in soil and piles.

AB Long-term field experiments are invaluable sites for studying changes in soil quality due to management practices. We utilized a field experiment on silt soil with 18 years (1982-1999) of conventional and organic farming systems for studying long-term impacts of farming system on soil properties. During 2000-2002, strawberries were grown on the whole area. Some conventional and organic plots were amended with peat in 2000 prior to strawberry planting. Chemical, biological and physical soil properties were measured in 2000-2002 at the end of the growing season. Several chemical properties were lower in the organic than in the conventional farming system, including electrical conductivity (1.12 x 10(4) S cm(-1) vs. 1.67 x 10(4) S cm(-1)) and amounts of extractable phosphorus (15.7 mg l(-1) vs. 24.8 mg l(-1) soil) and potassium (68.6 mg l(-1) vs. 83.6 mg l(-1) soil). In contrast, soil organic carbon was significantly higher in the organic than in the conventional system (2.5% vs. 3.0%) in 2001. Farming system had no impact on pH, extractable nitrate, calcium and magnesium. Microbial biomass carbon was 20-25% higher in the organic than in the conventional system each year and microbial biomass nitrogen 32 and 23% higher in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Farming system affected also earthworms positively by increasing their numbers from 64.9 earthworms m(-2) soil in conventional to 134.9 in organic. The effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was slightly elevated in organic as compared with conventional in 2001. In contrast, mycorrhizal spore numbers were lower in organic than in conventional (64.4 spores 100 ml(-1) soil vs. 195.3 spores 100 ml(-1) soil). Peat amendment increased soil organic carbon from 2.2 to 5.0% in 2000. In 2001, the corresponding values were 2.2 and 3.9%, indicating partial mineralization of added peat. Also water-holding capacity increased after peat amendment. In contrast, pH, electrical conductivity and amounts of extractable nitrate, phosphorus and calcium were lower in peat-amended plots. Most biological soil properties measured were also lower in peat-amended than in non-amended plots, including amounts of microbial biomass nitrogen (26.5 mu g g(-1) soil vs. 41.8 mu g g(-1) soil) and carbon (224.0 mu g g(-1) soil vs. 260.9 mu g g(-1) soil), AMF effectiveness (-18.5% vs. +4.2%) and arbuscular mycorrhizal spore numbers (59.9 spores 100 ml(-1) soil vs. 168.6 spores 100 ml(-1) soil) measured in 2000. Earthworms and nematodes were not affected by peat. It is concluded that management practice had a strong impact on soil quality, but more extensive studies are warranted for defining soil variables of major importance for crop yield.

AB Vegetation, environmental characteristics, and forest productivity were studied in the boreal forest in the North Klondike River Valley, Yukon Territory, Canada. The concept and approach of biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification were followed. For the treed vegetation, five ecosystem types were distinguished based on vegetation structure and physical and chemical properties of soils. They were: 1) spruce-lichen type, 2) spruce-moss type, 3) spruce-Equisetum type, 4) spruce-willow type, and 5) bog forest type. These types were differentiated mainly by moisture regime and base status of soils. The sequence of the ecosystem types reflected their topographical position from slope summit to valley bottom. The spruce-lichen type developed in the driest and nutritionally impoverished habitats, the spruce-Equisetum type occurred in moist and nutritionally enriched sites, and the spruce-moss type was found in between them. The bog forest type occurred where peat had accumulated sufficiently to generate ombrotrophic conditions in habitats of high water table underlain with permafrost. The spruce-willow type developed along small creeks where substrates were very coarse. Tree growth characteristics were measured, except for the bog forest type that did not have trees over 5 m tall. Total volume of standing trees ranged from 29 to 582 m(3)/ha, with an overall mean of 216.9 m(3)/ha. The spruce-Equisetum type exhibited the highest figure, 413.5 m(3)/ha, while the spruce - lichen type the lowest one, 87.7 m(3)/ha. Mean annual increment ranged from 0.15 to 2.66 m(3)/ha, with an overall mean of 1.10 m(3)/ha. A similar tendency was noted for all other forestry characteristics, i.e., the spruce-Equisetum type showed the highest productivity while the spruce-lichen type the lowest. This tendency was considered to be attributed to the availability of moisture and basic cations in soils.

AB Climate change has resulted in warmer soil temperatures, earlier spring thaw and later fall freeze-up, resulting in warmer soil temperatures and thawing of permafrost in tundra regions. While these changes in temperature metrics tend to lengthen the growing season for plants, light levels, especially in the fall, will continue to limit plant growth and nutrient uptake. We conducted a laboratory experiment using intact soil cores with and without vegetation from a tundra peatland to measure the effects of late freeze and early spring thaw on carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, methane (CH4) emissions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (N) leaching from soils. We compared soil C exchange and N production with a 30 day longer seasonal thaw during a simulated annual cycle from spring thaw through freeze-up and thaw. Across all cores, fall N leaching accounted for similar to 33% of total annual N loss despite significant increases in microbial biomass during this period. Nitrate(NO3-) leaching was highest during the fall (5.33 +/- 1.45 mgNm(-2) d(-1)) following plant senescence and lowest during the summer (0.43 +/- 0.22 mg Nm(-2) d(-1)). In the late freeze and early thaw treatment, we found 25% higher total annual ecosystem respiration but no significant change in CH4 emissions or DOC loss due to high variability among samples. The late freeze period magnified N leaching and likely was derived from root turnover and microbial mineralization of soil organic matter coupled with little demand from plants or microbes. Large N leaching during the fall will affect N cycling in low-lying areas and streams and may alter terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem nitrogen budgets in the arctic.

AB In the inland northwestern United States (US), Douglas-fir artificial regeneration commonly includes growing seedlings in media containing sphagnum peat. Concerns over the sustainability of peat and rising plant production costs are initiating investigation of growing media alternatives. Biochar is a potential media amendment that has positive physical and chemical properties for seedling production, including high water and nutrient retention due to large surface area, which may reduce leaching losses and improve fertilizer use efficiency. We used different amounts of biochar to amend peat-based growing media to determine if seedling growth response to various fertilizer rates differed with biochar amendments. Every 13 weeks for 39 weeks, replicate seedlings were measured for photosynthetic activity, destructively harvested, and analyzed for leaf nitrogen concentration. Biochar did not reduce fertilizer rates required to grow equal-sized seedlings or improve seedling growth. When mixed with peat at rates of 25% or 50% by volume, biochar progressively reduced height and diameter growth rates, seedling biomass, and photosynthetic rate. Biochar increased growing media pH to levels incompatible with conifer seedling requirements and decreased media extractable P concentration, which may have caused decreased photosynthesis. Adjusting pH of the biochar used would be necessary to grow Douglas-fir seedlings for forest regeneration.

AB Characterization of coal micro-structure and the associated rock mechanical properties are of key importance for coal seam exploration, coal bed methane development, enhanced coal bed methane production and CO2 storage in deep coal seams. Considerable knowledge exists about coal chemical properties, but less is known about the nanoscale to the micro-scale structure of coals and how they change with coal strength across coal ranks. Thus, in this study, 3D X-ray micro-computed tomography (with a voxel size of 3.43 mu m) and nano-indentation tests were conducted on coal samples of different ranks from peat to anthracite. The micro-structure of peats showed a well-developed pore system with meso- and micro-pores. The meso-pores essentially disappear with increasing rank, whereas the micro-pores persist and then increase past the bituminous rank. The micro-fracture system develops past the peat stage and by sub-bituminous ranks and changes into larger and mature fracture systems at higher ranks. The nano-indentation modulus showed the increasing trend from low- to high-rank coal with a perfect linear relationship with vitrinite reflectance and is highly correlated with carbon content as expected.

AB Current methods used in harvesting peat in eastern Canada have raised concerns regarding potential impacts of escaped peat particles on aquatic ecosystems. A study was carried out in Mill Creek, an estuarine tributary of the Richibucto River in New Brunswick, where peat originating from a commercial operation has accumulated over several years. The sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa Say (1818) was selected to determine potential environmental stress related to presence of peat in the sediment because of its close association with the substrate. Despite the introduction of sedimentation ponds at the harvesting site in 1994, peat particles continued to enter and accumulate in Mill Creek between 1997 and 1999. Increases in peat depth ranged from 6 to 31 cm and the volume of surficial (0-15 cm) sediments containing peat increased from 35% in 1997 to 44% in 1998 and 76% in 1999. Beach seine surveys carried out during July to September of 1996-1998 indicated that fewer sand shrimp occurred over substrates having higher (> 66%) peat concentration than over sand or mud with lower (< 33%) peat concentration. Length of sand shrimp did not vary consistently with peat concentration but sand shrimp caught over substrates containing medium (34-65%) peat concentration displayed lower condition [wet weight at total length (TL)] than conspecifics from substrates of both higher and lower peat concentration in all surveys. In a separate survey, peat was found in the stomachs of sand shrimp caught over substrates composed of high but not low peat concentration. We conclude that present mitigation measures at this site have been ineffective in preventing escape of peat moss into the estuarine environment and that the resulting peat deposition has reduced habitat quality for estuarine macrofauna as reflected in a reduction of the number and condition of sand shrimp.

AB The main physical properties of forest Peat soils relevant to their drainage are discussed. Drainage depth standards can be set in terms of the hydrophysical characteristics of the soils. In the non-Chernozem zone, in order to achieve favorable moisture conditions in forest drainage, the soil water level during the growth period should be at a depth of 30-50 cm in slightly decomposed high moor peat soil and at depths of 50 to 70 cm in well-decomposed low moor peat soil.

AB Elevated atmospheric CO2 is widely reported to stimulate the plant growth and affect plant physiological processes. However, studies on the respond of tropical plant species to elevated CO2 are quite limited and remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 treatments on the photosynthetic characteristics, growth and biomass in Shorea platycarpa. Saplings of S. platycarpa were grown for seven months in the open roof gas chamber supplied with elevated CO2 (800 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1)) and in the shade house with ambient CO2 (400 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1)). Measurements of S. platycarpa growth and photosynthetic characteristics were made at frequent intervals. Biomass characteristics were determined using destructive methods after seven months of treatment and nondestructive method was used for leaf area index (LAI) determination. Photosynthetic rate (A) of S. platycarpa was not significantly affected by elevated CO2. Increased water use efficiency (WUE) of S. platycarpa grown in elevated CO2 was due to the reduced stomatal conductance (g(s)) and transpiration rate (E). The CO2 elevation had no significant effect on the S. platycarpa relative growth rates (RGR) and biomass but significantly reduced the leaf area. A weak correlation was found between photosynthetic rate (A) and relative growth rate (RGR). The results clearly showed that photosynthesis, growth rate and biomass of S. platycarpa were not significantly enhanced by elevated CO2. The findings indicated that elevated CO2 did not affect a relatively slow growing and a late successional peat swamp tree species.

AB A large portion of surface layers on earth in moderate regions consist of peat which is the case in northern parts of Iran where peat layers are of considerable depth. Peat has very low strength and is highly compressible under loads and very moisture-sensitive, and thus considered problematic. As a result, stabilizing peat is the aim of many civil engineering projects. In the present experimental study, the effects of cement and sand on geomechanical properties of peat have been studied. The samples were prepared with different cement and sand contents of 5, 10 and 15% of each additive. To investigate the geomechanical effects of these additives on peat, atterberg limits tests, compaction test, unconfined compressive strength and CBR tests were performed. The results indicated a significant improvement in geotechnical properties of peat which was validated by SEM scanning of samples microstructure.

AB Here we present results from a field experiment in an Arctic wetland situated in Zackenberg, NE Greenland. During one growing season we investigated how dominance of the sedge Eriophorum scheuchzeri affected the below-ground concentrations of low molecular weight carbon compounds (LMWOC) and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in comparison to dominance of other sedges (Carex stans and Dupontia psilosantha). Three groups of LMWOC were analysed using liquid chromatography-ionspray tandem mass spectrometry, i.e., organic acids (OAs), amino acids (AAs) and simple carbohydrates (CHs). To identify the effect of plant composition the experiments were carried out in a continuous fen area with very little between species variation in environmental conditions, e.g., water-table and active layer thickness and soil temperature. The pool of labile LMWOC compounds in this Arctic fen was dominated by OAs, constituting between 75 and 83% of the total pore water pool of OAs. CHs and Ms. The dominant OA was acetic acid, an easily available substrate for methanogens, which constituted >= 85% of the OA pool. We estimated that the concentration of acetic acid found in pore water would support 2 -2.5 h of CH4 flux and an additional continuous input of acetic acid through root exudation that would support 1.3-1.5 h of CH4 flux. Thus, the results clearly points to the importance of a continuous input for acetoclastic methanogenesis to be sustainable. Additionally, Eriophorum had a very strong effect on parts of the carbon cycle in the Arctic fen. The mean seasonal CH4 flux was twice as high in Eriophorum dominated plots, most likely due to a 1.7 times higher concentration of OAs in these plots. Further, the ecosystem respiration was 1.3 times higher in Eriophorum dominated plots. In conclusion, the results offer further support to the importance of certain vascular plant species for the carbon cycle of wetland ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There has been an increasing need to reconstruct past climate from proxy records quantitatively and mechanistically. The inverse proxy modeling method stands out as a novel approach to quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions through integrating process-based models and proxy records, representing a major progress in quantitative palaeoclimatology. It has been proposed to incorporate multiple proxy records to produce a more robust constraint on the climate parameters sought for estimation, and most of the work has been conducted using pollen records in conjunction with vegetation models. Here, I show a worked example of using paired stable oxygen and carbon isotope records of peat cellulose from one single core to infer the climate history in NE China for the last 6000 years through solving a well-posed inverse problem using Bayesian statistics. The quantitative palaeoclimate data obtained in this study may deepen our insight into the dynamics of the East Asian summer monsoon. Mean growing season temperature and relative humidity show millennial-scale fluctuations prior to c. 4000 cal. yr BP; thereafter, centennial-scale fluctuations prevailed, revealing the relative importance of solar activity over tropical ocean-atmosphere interactions in regulating the variability of regional climate during the late Holocene. It appears that there was a prominent out-of-phase relationship between temperature and relative humidity, due probably to the different response of these climate elements to orbital forcing and land cover. This worked example demonstrates the potential of using model-data fusion techniques to produce physically meaningful, mathematically optimal, and geologically sound results.

AB Site properties have received limited attention in analyzing the weather-growth relationship of trees. We analyzed the annual growth variation of Scots pine on two extreme sites in southern Finland: a dry hill top site and a moist patch of mineral soil surrounded by a large peatland. The effects of daily precipitation and temperature were related to growth variation using correlation analyses. In addition, the common signal and the difference of ring-width indices from the dry and moist sites were studied via principal component analysis and related to the daily weather measurements. All possible time intervals longer than 14 days from current year April 1st to August 31st were tested. We also modeled daily photosynthetic production of Scots pine using two parameter sets, one describing limited stomatal closure and the other one easily triggered stomatal closure. Growth variation at the dry site was linked with variation of precipitation during early and middle parts of growing season, while growth at moist site was correlated with temperature during the middle part of growing season. Daily photosynthetic production, modeled with parameters describing mostly open stomata produced a rather strong negative correlation with ring-width indices from the dry site, possibly indicating that the parametrization overestimated growth during dry years. Other than that, the modeled photosynthetic production was relatively weakly correlated with the ring-width indices. Evidently, the mechanisms controlling Scots pine growth at drought-sensitive sites in southern Finland are complex. Overall, the results indicate that site properties, especially water retention capacity, need to be considered in dendroecological research.

AB 'Alases' are mature thermokarst depressions covered by grassland distributed in taiga forests in central Yakutia, eastern Siberia, following thermokarst formation initiated in early Holocene. Alases are important land-cover class in the central Yakutia lowland occupying 17% of the total land area. CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured temporally in a typical alas which have a pond at the center during the growing season of two years. Seven monitoring plots represented various vegetation types: a larch forest (F), a dry grassland (DG), four wet grasslands (WG) flooded temporarily or continuously, and a pond surface (P) flooded continuously without vegetation. The pond flooding area reached its maximum just after snow-melting and decreased during the summer. The F and DG plots were small CH4 sinks. The wet plots (including WG and P) were large CH4 sources (cumulative value of growing season: 17 to 864 kg CH4-C ha(-1)), and emission rates vary drastically depending on flooding conditions. All plots were slight sources or sinks of N2O except for the WG plots (0.16 to 1.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) where peak emissions were observed after the flooding ended. The global warming potentials (time horizon of 100 years) of the cumulative N2O emissions from the plots were lower than those of each CH4 emissions. Estimated total CH4 emission from the whole WG area (7.93 ha) accounted for 88% of the emission from the whole alas (28.9 ha). The current permafrost-taiga region in central Yakutia could be a net CH4 source owing to the presence of alases.

Phosphorus concentration was investigated using three methods during 1993; Olsen's reagent (sodium bicarbonate) for soil P, centrifuging and polymeric suction cups for soil solution P. Solutions were extracted at two-weekly intervals during the spring and at monthly intervals during the summer. Phosphorus removed from both sites by centrifuging was in the range 5-30 mu g dm(-3) soil, in comparison with 1-6 mg kg(-1) for Olsen P. Olsen P on the Cirsio-Molinietum was significantly lower than on the improved pasture in mid-March and mid-June. The concentration of P in soil solution removed by suction cups was below the level of detection (<2 mu g dm(-3)) on the Cirsio-Molinietum. Suction cup P on the improved pasture peaked in April and May at 16-19 mu g dm(-3) soil. Herbage yield and P concentration were measured throughout the growing season. Above-ground standing crop was greater on the Cirsio-Molinietum than the improved pasture at the beginning of the grazing season, because of the large litter component on the former. Total P content of this material was only 1.81 kg P ha(-1) on the Cirsio-Molinietum, in comparison with 5.58 kg P ha(-1) on the improved pasture. Phosphorus concentration of plant material obtained by repeated defoliation was approximately 1.0 mg P g(-1) DM on the Cirsio-Molinietum, whereas a clear seasonal trend, peaking at 3.5 mg P g(-1) DM, was observed on the improved pasture. phosphorus concentration of litter, grass and sedge from ungrazed plots on the Cirsio-Molinietum indicated distinct seasonal variations for the grass, with no seasonal pattern for the sedge component.

AB The late Holocene (from 3500 yr BP to present) in eastern North America is characterised by a marked rise of water levels in lakes and by the accumulation of numerous peat bogs. According to a number of researchers, this could be due to an increase in winter precipitations that would have resulted in large water volumes released by snowmelt, inducing groundwater recharge and rise of water bodies such as lakes and aquifers. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by stratigraphical studies of small alluvial fans in Quebec. Radiocarbon dates from four small alluvial fans in the Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspesie regions indicate that these fans have been formed in the last 3500 years, due to an increase in forest runoff associated with spring snowmelt.

AB In this work, the effect of combinations of peats, which have different characteristics on mushroom yield and earliness, was investigated. The most important problem in mushroom cultivation is to obtain a suitable peat in Turkiye. It is necessary to find practical performance and proper combinational materials for casing. In the study, peats from 3 different locations, which are generally used by mushroom growers in Turkiye, were investigated. Peats were used in mixture of 25, 50, 75 and 100% v/v proportions of different peat sources. Mushroom was harvested daily, and the total yield of every seven days were evaluated, earliness and yield obtained during 21 days (three flushes) were tested as a total yield. The highest mushroom yield and earliness were obtained from rough and brown peat 25%+more decomposed and black peat 75% treatment.

AB In salt marshes, most biomass plus large reserves of biologically important N, P, Fe, and S are sequestered below ground under saline, waterlogged, and anaerobic conditions. Thus, hydrologic alterations such as diking and ditch drainage that reduce salinity and increase peat aeration can cause radical changes in the composition of salt marsh soils.
   Experimental short-term desalination and drainage of salt marsh cores in greenhouse microcosms caused Spartina production to increase after one growing season, reflecting decreased salt stress and sulfide toxicity. However, production thereafter declined, likely due to pyrite oxidation and acidification in drained treatments and sulfide accumulation in waterlogged treatments.
   A survey of longer-term (decadal) effects of diking on pear composition of Cape God, Massachusetts, USA, marshes revealed acidification, Fe(II) mobilization, and decreased organic content in drained sites. Despite the aerobic decomposition of organic matter, abundant nutrients remained as sorbed NH4 and mineral-bound PO4. In diked, seasonally waterlogged sites, porewater alkalinity, sulfide, ammonium and orthophosphate were much lower, and organic solids higher, than in adjacent natural marsh.
   Seawater was added to cores from diked marshes to study the effects of tidal restoration. Salination of the drained peat increased porewater pH, alkalinity ammonium, orthophosphate, Fe, and Al; copious ammonium N, and Fe(II) for sulfide precipitation favored Spartina growth. Salination of diked-waterlogged peat increased sulfate reduction and caused 6-8 cm of sediment subsidence. The resulting increase in porewater sulfides and waterlogging decreased vigor of transplanted Spartina alterniflora. Results indicate that seawater restoration should proceed cautiously to avoid nutrient loading of surface waters in drained sites or sulfide toxicity in diked-waterlogged marshes.

AB The outcrop of Oligocene age at Dong Ho, northern Vietnam, may constitute an immature analogue to offshore terrestrial source rocks in the greater Song Hong Basin. The outcrop includes an interval with two source rocks: (1) highly oil-prone carbonaceous mudstones containing kerogen types IIA and IIA/I, and with TOC contents from 6.48 to 16.89 wt%, and HI values from 472 to 690; and (2) oil-prone humic coals (kerogen type III) with HI values from 200 to 242. The mudstones were deposited in oxygen-deficient lakes, which on occasion were subject to marine influence, and the coals accumulated in freshwater peat-forming mires. The coals have broad activation energy (E-a) distributions, while the mudstones have E-a distributions characterised by a pronounced principal E-a. During artificial maturation about 16-17% of the organic carbon in the coals and 45-50% of the organic carbon in the mudstones participated in petroleum formation. The two source rocks primary generate oil and secondary generate gas, however, the mudstones realised the majority of their potential over a more narrow temperature range than the coals. The excellent generative potential of the terrestrial source rocks at Dong Ho is encouraging for offshore exploration for reservoirs charged by Cenozoic rift-lake successions.

AB The purpose of this study was to detect nutrient uptake and assimilation in woody plants subjected to growing media with some peat replaced by spent mushroom residue (SMR). Fragrant rosewood (Dalbergia odorifera T.C. Chen) seedlings were cultured in five types of growing media with SMR and peat in volumetric proportions of 0% (control), 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. With the increase of SMR proportion, ammonium- and nitrate-nitrogen (N) concentrations declined but available phosphorus (P) concentration and electrical conductance both increased. Seedlings in the full SMR substrates showed obvious mortality. Seedlings in substrates with SMR in proportions higher than 25% showed symptoms of excessive N and P toxicities. The utilization efficiency for P was highest in the 25% SMR growing-media. Mineral N in substrates had a positive relationship with growth and biomass but not with glutamine synthetase activity. Available P was negatively related with acid phosphatase activity in both leaves and roots. Un-composted SMR can replace 25% of peat in growing media for fragrant rosewood seedlings, benefitting P uptake and assimilation.

AB The unicellular model alga Micrasterias denticulata inhabits acid peat bogs that are highly endangered by pollutants due to their high humidity. As it was known from earlier studies that algae like Micrasterias are capable of storing barium naturally in form of BaSO4 crystals, it was interesting to experimentally investigate distribution and sequestration of barium and the chemically similar alkaline earth metal strontium. Additionally, we intended to analyze whether biomineralization by crystal formation contributes to diminution of the generally toxic effects of these minerals to physiology and structure of this alga which is closely related to higher plants.
   The results show that depending on the treatment differently shaped crystals are formed in BaCl2 and Cl-2 Sr exposed Micrasterias cells. Modern microscopic techniques such as analytical TEM by electron energy loss spectroscopy and Raman microscopy provide evidence for the chemical composition of these crystals. It is shown that barium treatment results in the formation of insoluble BaSO4 crystals that develop within distinct compartments. During strontium exposure long rod-like crystals are formed and are surrounded by membranes. Based on the Raman signature of these crystals their composition is attributed to strontium citrate. These crystals are instable and are dissolved during cell death. During strontium as well as barium treatment cell division rates and photosynthetic oxygen production decreased in dependence of the concentration, whereas cell vitality was reduced only slightly. Together with the fact that TEM analyses revealed only minor ultrastructural alterations as consequence of relatively high concentrated BaCl2 and Cl-2 Sr exposure, this indicates that biomineralization of Sr and Ba protects the cells from severe damage or cell death at least within a particular concentration range and time period. In the case of Sr treatment where ROS levels were found to be elevated, hallmarks for autophagy of single organelles were observed by TEM, indicating beginning degradation processes.

   TRANSFORMATION; PYROLYSIS
AB Anatomical characteristics of peatified Calluna vulgaris stems isolated from a selection of Northwest European raised bog peat deposits were compared with intact stems in order to reveal anatomical modifications caused by the peatification process. Four main decomposition processes were discerned: (1) loss of structural integrity of cell walls and cell inclusions; (2) gelification and swelling of cell walls; (3) discolouration of cell walls; and (4) deposition of matter in cell lumina.
   Fibre-tracheids and wood parenchyma appear to be the most affected cell types. The two main decomposition trends discerned in these tissues were related to different fungal types. Precipitation of decay products was mainly observed in vessels. Bark tissues, primary xylem and medullary parenchyma were characterized by an excellent anatomical preservation. In the first stages of peatification a rapid decrease in cell contents was observed in bark tissues. Swelling and gelification was mainly seen in cell walls of the cambium and vessels.
   We conclude that different types of cell walls respond differently to decay conditions. This is probably related to differences in the original cell wall chemistry. A high intra- and intercellular variability in degree of preservation was sometimes observed in identical tissues. The microscopic variability arising during peatification of wood and bark testifies to the heterogeneity of coal macerals derived from these tissues.

AB Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of methane flux from boreal wetlands makes prediction and up-scaling challenging, both within and among wetland systems. Drivers of methane production and emissions are also highly variable, making empirical model development difficult and leading to uncertainty in methane emissions estimates from wetlands. Previous studies have examined this problem using point-scale (static chamber method) and ecosystem-scale (flux tower methods) measurements, but few studies have investigated whether different processes are observed at these scales. We analyzed methane emissions from a boreal fen, measured by both techniques, using data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study. We sought to identify driving processes associated with methane emissions at two scales and explain diurnal patterns in emissions measured by the tower. The mean methane emission rates from flux chambers were greater than the daytime, daily mean rates measured by the tower, but the nighttime, daily mean emissions from the tower were often an order of magnitude greater than emissions recorded during the daytime. Thus, daytime measurements from either the tower or chambers would lead to a biased estimate of total methane emissions from the wetland. We found that the timing of nighttime emission events was coincident with the cooling and convective mixing within hollows, which occurred regularly during the growing season. We propose that diurnal thermal stratification in shallow pools traps methane by limiting turbulent transport. This methane stored during daytime heating is later released during evening cooling due to convective turbulent mixing.

AB Respiratory exposure to organic dust induces chronic pulmonary diseases both in farmers and horses. The aim of this study was to examine the variation of dustiness and hygiene quality of peat moss bedding. Materials studied were weakly decomposed sphagnum peat (A), weakly decomposed sphagnum peat warmed up in storage (> 30 degrees C) (B) and two more decomposed few-flowered sedge peats (C and D). The geometric mean of mesophilic fungi, thermotolerant fungi and thermophilic actinomycetes were determined from the material. Samples of inhalable dust and endotoxins were collected with IOM samplers and respirable dust with IOM foam samplers when the peat was rotated in a cylinder. The number of particles was detected with an optical particle counter. An LAL assay was used for analysing endotoxins from the filter samples. There were differences in the hygiene quality and dustiness between peat materials (p < 0.01). The geometric mean of fungi was smallest in material A. Warming-up increased the number of fungi in sphagnum peat, but on the other hand, it decreased the content of endotoxin (p < 0.01). Few-flowered peat materials contained thermophilic actinomycetes and material D also contained Aspergillus fumigatus. The concentrations of inhalable dust, respirable dust and the number of particles were smaller in the few-flowered peats (C-D) than in the sphagnum peats (A-B). It is concluded that there are differences in the dustiness and hygiene quality of peat bedding.

AB Fish offal-peat compost was hydrolysed and the resultant liquid extracts used as substrate in the cultivation of the yeast Candida utilis. The yeast was able to grow in this culture medium, attaining a growth yield of approximately 260 g biomass kg-1 total carbohydrate consumed. The biomass produced had a good amino acid composition, with a protein content of 520 g kg-1, and a relatively low lipid content. Dry yeast was used as a feed component in the diet of cultivated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in which it substituted well for other, traditional sources of protein.

ID ORGANIC-MATTER; STRUCTURAL STABILITY; DECOMPOSITION; MANAGEMENT; CARBON
AB Soil structure has been destroyed over large areas of arid and semi-arid regions by soil degradation processes.  This study was conducted to investigate the effects of two organic amendments, urban refuse and peat, on the improvement of soil structure and to analyse correlations between organic carbon content, fungal and bacterial populations and aggregate stability.  Two series of five plots were established in the southeast of Spain, in typical Mediterranean semi-arid to arid conditions.  To one series different initial doses of urban refuse (0, 6.5, 13, 19.5 and 26 kg m-2) were added, whereas to the other series different doses of peat (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 kg m-2) were added.
   The average percentage of stable aggregates showed a significant increase (31.6, 41.1, 53.7, 63.2%) with increased levels of urban refuse with respect to the control.  On the other hand, peat was not effective in improving stable aggregates.  The beneficial effect which appeared with urban refuse remained in the soil two years after application, probably due to the growth of natural vegetal cover in the treated plots.  A marked increase in fungal and bacterial populations and a decrease in extractable organic carbon was observed in the plots into which urban refuse was incorporated.  This, together with the high correlation coefficients between the percentage of stable aggregates and the microbial population, suggested that the combined action of polysaccharides from the urban refuse and the increase in microbiological activity was responsible for the initial formation of soil aggregates.

AB Purpose of Review Understanding of how fire affects the carbon cycle and climate is crucial for climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. As those are often based on Earth system model simulations, we identify recent progress and research needs that can improve the model representation of fire and its impacts.
   Recent Findings New constraints of fire effects on the carbon cycle and climate are provided by the quantification of the carbon ages and effects of vegetation types and traits. For global scale modelling, the low understanding of the human-fire relationship is limiting.
   Summary Recent developments allow improvements in Earth system models with respect to the influences of vegetation on climate, peatland burning and the pyrogenic carbon cycle. Better understanding of human influences is required. Given the impacts of fire on carbon storage and climate, thorough understanding of the effects of fire in the Earth system is crucial to support climate change mitigation and adaptation.

AB Peatlands represent massive global C pools and sinks. Carbon accumulation depends on the ratio between net primary production and decomposition, both of which can change under projected increases of atmospheric CO2 and N deposition. The decomposition of litter is influenced by 1) the quality of the litter, and 2) the microenvironmental conditions in which the litter decomposes. This study aims at experimentally testing the effects of these two drivers in the context of global change. We studied the in situ litter decomposition from three common peatland species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Polytrichum strictum and Sphagnum fallax) collected after one year of litter production under pre-treatment conditions (elevated CO2: 560 ppm or enhanced N: 3 g m(-2) y(-1) NH4NO3) and decomposed the following year under treatment conditions (same as pre-treatment). By considering the cross-effects between pre-treatments and treatments, we distinguished between the effects on mass loss of 1) the pre-treatment-induced litter quality and 2) the treatment conditions under which the litters were decomposing. The combination between CO2 pre-treatment and CO2 treatment reduced Polytrichum decomposition by 24% and this can be explained by litter quality-driven decomposition changes brought by the pre-treatment. CO2 pre-treatment reduced Eriophorum litter quality, although this was not sufficient to predict decomposition. The N addition pretreatment reduced the decomposition of Eriophorum, due to enhanced lignin and soluble phenols concentrations in the initial litter, and reduced litter-driven losses of starch and enhanced litter-driven losses of soluble phenols. While decomposition indices based on initial litter quality provide a broad explanation of quantitative and qualitative decomposition, they can only be taken as first approximations. Indeed, the microbial ATP activity, the litter N loss and resulting litter quality, were strongly altered irrespective of the compounds' initial concentration and by means of processes that occurred independently of the initial litter-qualitative changes. The experimental design was valuable to assess litter- and ecosystem-driven decomposition pathways simultaneously or independently. The ability to separate these two drivers makes it possible to attest the presence of litter-qualitative changes even without any litter biochemical determinations, and shows the screening potential of this approach for future experiments dealing with multiple plant species.

AB The paper presents the results of sedimentological and biostratigraphical analyses from the Resko Przymorskie Lake spit (NW Poland), supported by radiocarbon datings. The study has aimed to recognize the geological structure of the spit and its base and to recognize the palaeoenivronmental changes. Nine sedimentary series composing the Resko Przymorskie Lake spit have been distinguished (I-IX). The oldest sediments are the Vistulian Glaciation till (series I) and fluvioglacial sand and gravel (series II). In the Early Holocene, in the study area there was a river valley (series III) followed by a shallow water basin (series IV), which was replaced by a peat bog (series V). In the Atlantic (7.4 ka cal BP), the water level rose (Littorina transgression) and accumulation of lagoonal sediments started (series VI). Biostratigraphic analysis of deposits in series VI indicates a marine influence. In the Atlantic and Subboreal, the spit moved southwards and fine sand (series VII) was deposited on lagoonal gyttja and silt (series VI). In the western part of the study area, peat accumulated (series VIII), dated at 6.7 ka cal BP (Late Atlantic). The youngest series IX is composed of aeolian fine sand in white dunes that formed in the last 400 years.

AB Several processes may contribute to systematic downcore trends in delta C-13 of bulk Sphagnum peat. Whereas changes in water availability during C assimilation may change delta C-13 values in both it negative and positive direction, other processes would always cause a uni-directional shift in delta C-13. Selective preservation of isotopically light lignin C may lead to more negative delta C-13 values with an increasing depth and age of peat. Anthropogenic change toward lower delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2 due to massive coal burning since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution would result in lower delta C-13 of the youngest peat layers, and in higher delta C-13 of older peat layers. Emissions of low-delta C-13 methane from wetlands should result in a progressive enrichment of the residual peat substrate in the heavier isotope delta C-13. Consequently, deeper peat would have higher delta C-13. In a specific peat profile, the downcore trend in delta C-13 will be the result of an interplay between all these isotope-sensitive processes. Most Central European wetlands studied previously show a delta C-13 enrichment (i.e., higher delta C-13 values) with an increasing depth and age. Here we focus on sites which showed lower delta C-13 with an increasing depth and age when a single peat core was taken. Replication did not confirm this negative downcore delta C-13 shift. A positive downcore delta C-13 shift is more widespread than previously believed. We suggest that decreasing delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2 and emissions of low-delta C-13 methane belong to the main controls of the downcore delta C-13 trends in young peat substrate.

Among the tested peats the best sorption properties have been found for low-moor peats: Humus Peat and Rush Peat, characterized by high decomposition rates (DR). Among studied heavy metals, the greatest chemical affinity to sorption sites showed chromium ions, bound onto organic matter in insoluble forms, the lowest - zinc and cadmium ions, which mostly enriched mobile forms.

ID PITCHER-PLANT; DIVERSITY; RICHNESS
AB The development of a community through time, or succession, is generally described as the orderly replacement of species until a deterministic, stable endpoint is reached. However, stochastic factors, coupled with intrinsic biotic factors, such as herbivory or predation, can cause communities within the same habitat to become highly dissimilar in composition. Much research on the succession of terrestrial systems has been conducted, but factors influencing the succession of a terrestrial system may not apply to aquatic systems. To determine whether succession in an aquatic system is deterministic or dominated by contingency of stochastic factors, and the role that higher trophic level interactions and resources have in shaping successional patterns, I followed community development and dynamics of the intermediate and bottom trophic level (protozoans and bacteria) in the model Sarracenia purpurea pitcher plant system throughout an entire growing season. By comparing these dynamics across pitcher plant leaves within the same bog, I was able to determine whether there is a predictable pattern for community assembly in this aquatic community. The results from this study suggest that rather than a sequential replacement of early colonizers with more competitive species through time, competitively superior species establish in newly formed communities simultaneously with less competitive species, which coexist throughout the growing season. Community assembly in this system can also be altered by stochastic events. Resources and predators had a variable effect on the patterns of community change observed during succession. Patterns of community assembly were also dependent on the trophic level examined but, for the bottom trophic level, not on the sampling method used.

AB Major, trace, rare-earth elements, and noble metal have been analyzed from the brown coal of the Amur region (Russian Federation) and coal combustion products to understand the provenance and depositional environment. It was discussed that weathering crusts of ore deposits and host rocks located in the mountain-folded frame of the Zeya-Bureya coal-bearing sedimentary basin were the main source of mineral substance and chemical elements in brown coals. The distribution of minerals and elements inside the forming coal seams was influenced by the type of vegetation incorporated into coal-forming peat mires bog by catastrophic floods along the existed hydraulic network, the physicochemical parameters of plant debris transformation during their conversion to coal, as well as the sorption properties of inclusions and interlayer of bitumen and humic acids in coal beds. An experimental technological complex was created to study the microelements transfer process in the dust-gas stream and the distribution of rare earth and trace elements separately in varieties of coal combustion products (slag, fly ash, dust-like part of the dust-gas flow, and technogenic cleaning water). The resulting combustion products of coal have been studied by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-spectrometry methods (ICP-mass spectrometry and ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy). Sample preparation technique for analysis was improved to determine the elemental composition. It was established that more than 60% of trace and rare earth elements were concentrated in ash and sludge. Data on these elements' concentration in the wash water sediment demonstrated a sufficiently high efficiency of the dust-gas flow cleaning. The use of a wet scrubber, of course, solves the problem of collecting the dust and gas flow cleaning from harmful and toxic elements of coal smoke, which should be a part of the technological chain of a coal combustion process in industrial boilers. Rare earth elements, scandium, and yttrium are considered economically valuable components in the coal combustion products of the Yerkovetskoe brown coal deposit in the Amur Region.

ID MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; BIOMASS
AB Analysis of phospholipids extracted from various moss and sedge peat types revealed significant differences in the patterns of the phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) with respect to the major botanical constituents of the peats. Principal component analysis of the PLFA data showed that peats dominated by Carex residues had higher relative amounts of cyclopropane fatty acids and cis vaccenic fatty acid (18:1omega7c), but lower proportions of iso and anteiso methyl branched fatty acids compared to peat types dominated by Sphagnum residues. The data analysis also revealed a larger variation in the PLFA composition among the Sphagnum peats compared to the Carex types, which seems to relate to a larger variation in botanical composition among the Sphagnum than Carex peats. The differences in the fatty acid pattern indicate that the botanical composition influenced the bacterial community with Carex peats having a higher proportion of Gram-negative bacteria but lower proportion of Gram-positive bacteria compared to the Sphagnum peats. An exception was pure Sphagnum peats dominated by the subsection Acutifolia, where the bacterial community showed a closer similarity with the Carex peats. The ratios of trans to cis isomers of the unsaturated fatty acids 16:1omega7 and 18:1omega7 were positively correlated with the degree of decomposition of the peat types, and may be an indication of increased starvation in the bacterial community as the decomposition proceeds.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the use of peat as a potential lignocellulose source in composites manufactured by twin-screw extrusion. The effects of peat decomposition rate and particle size on the mechanical properties and moisture resistance of peat-polypropylene (PP) composites under cyclic conditions were evaluated. The properties of the peat-PP composites were compared to commercial lignocellulosic fibre products, namely wood-plastic composite (WPC), medium density fibreboard (MDF) and hardboard (HB). The results show that prior cyclic freeze-thaw testing peat-PP composites had properties equal to commercial WPC, but their mechanical permanence was better after freeze thaw conditioning. When moderately decomposed, smaller particle-size peat was used, peat-PP composites had better dimensional stability, though particle size did not affect as much as the decomposition degree. Thus, the chemical structure of peat has a greater influence on composite durability, as better water and weather resistance are achieved with peat that is more decomposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The role of clay incorporation on the physical properties and wettability of peat-growing media was assessed from water retention curves and from contact angle and water drop penetration time measurements, respectively. Two peat substrates presenting different degrees of decomposition (weakly and highly decomposed Sphagnum peat) were used and mixed with clay in the form of powder with a peat:clay ratio of 90:10 (by vol.). Results indicated relatively little change in water retention resulting from clay incorporation in the peat-growing media tested. On the other hand, they showed a significant improvement of the wettability of both substrates in the driest conditions when peat-growing media presented a pronounced hydrophobic character, whereas the wettability of materials was not changed in the wettest conditions when they were largely hydrophilic. The influence of the degree of peat decomposition was also observed with somewhat higher wettability for the weakly decomposed peat:clay mixture than for the highly decomposed peat:clay mixture. Because the hydrophobic character of highly decomposed peat is more pronounced and appears at a higher water content than weakly decomposed peat, the effect of clay addition also appears at higher water contents for highly decomposed peat. Incorporating clay into peat-growing media should be considered for its ability to improve the wettability of growing media with a hydrophobic character (i.e., to improve the ability of the growing media to be rewetted) rather than only its ability to influence the water retention characteristics of the growing media.

ID DEPOSITIONAL MODELS; RIVER DEPOSITS; SEDIMENTATION; BASIN; SEQUENCES;
   PATTERNS; EXAMPLES; ALBERTA; CANADA
AB Alluvial strata of the Cretaceous Dakota Formation of southern Utah are part of a transgressive systems tract associated with a foreland basin developed adjacent to the Sevier orogenic belt. These strata contain valley fill deposits, anastomosed channel systems and widespread coals. The coals constitute a relatively minor part of the Dakota Formation in terms of sediment volume, but may represent a substantial amount of the time represented by the formation. The coals are separated by clastic units up to 20 m thick.
   The stratigraphically lowest clastic unit of the Dakota Formation lies above an unconformity cut into Jurassic rocks. Incised valleys associated with the unconformity are up to 12 m deep. Two discrete episodes of valley fill sedimentation are recognized, including a lower sandstone unit with conglomerate layers, and an upper, discontinuous, coal-bearing unit. After the valleys filled, the area became one of low relief where extensive mires formed. Peat accumulation was interrupted at least three times by deposition of clastic sediment derived from the west.
   The clastic units consist of sandstone, mudstone or heterolithic ribbon bodies, stacked tabular sandstones, and laminated mudstones, and contain minor coal beds less than 0.35 m thick. Ribbon bodies are 1-9 m thick and 15-160 m wide, have pronounced basal scours, and are filled with both lateral and vertical accretion deposits. An anastomosed channel complex is suggested by the large number of coeval channels of varying dimensions, the variation in the structure and grain size of channel fills, and the presence of abundant tabular sandstones interpreted as crevasse splays. Although some sandstone bodies have well developed lateral accretion surfaces, the overall ribbon geometry indicates that mature meandering streams were not well developed. This is in contrast to modern anastomosed systems, which are commonly thought to be a transitional morphology caused by avulsion of a meander belt to a new position on its floodplain. Rather than being a transitional channel pattern related to river avulsion, the anastomosed channels of the Dakota Formation may have formed part of a large inland delta that episodically invaded widespread mires. The mires developed during periods when clastic influx was reduced either by high rates of subsidence close to the thrust belt or by deflection of rivers by emergent thrusts.

AB Fluxes of heat and water vapor were measured on a 20-m tower at Kinosheo Lake in the Hudson Bay lowlands using eddy correlation and Bowen ratio energy balance techniques. The study period was June 25 to July 28, 1990. Measurements were made over a peat bog consisting of a mixture of sphagnum moss and lichen hummocks and black pools. About 200 m west of the tower were several shallow ponds. The hummocks had a dry, insulating surface and were underlain by an ice layer near 50 cm depth until mid-July. At the beginning of the period the black pools were covered with water, and although the free water gradually disappeared over the study period, they remained saturated to the end of July. The depth of peat near the tower was about 3 m. Despite the ice layer under the hummocks, their daytime surface temperatures were high, near 35 degrees C, and after the middle of July, above 40 degrees C. Inspection of temperature, precipitation, and radiation data showed that the midsummer period of 1990 was warmer, drier, and sunnier than usual at Moosonee and so by inference at Lake Kinosheo. When all the data were combined to yield average diurnal energy balance components, the eddy correlation fluxes accounted for 90% of the available energy. Latent heat flux averaged 46% of the total available energy and the sensible heat flux averaged 34%. Daytime Bowen ratios were near 1 for the experimental period, suggesting that the bog behaved more like a dryland than a wetland. Eddy correlation measurements of sensible heat and latent heat flux were less than those measured using the Bowen ratio energy balance technique, the average ratios being 0.81 and 0.86, respectively. These differences were possibly due to the difficulty in measuring energy balance components of net radiation and ground heat flux over the mosaic surface.

AB The sediments dredged from a waterway and decontaminated through a phytoremediation process have been used as substrates alternatively to the traditional forest nursery substrate for pot productions of holm oak (Quercus ilex L) planting stocks. The substrates, made by mixing decontaminated sediments to agricultural soil at different degrees, were tested in order to evaluate their suitability as growth substrates. The experiment was carried out at the nursery of the Department of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Systems of the University of Florence (Italy). The experimental design consisted of four randomized blocks with six pots as replicates for each of the following treatments: 100% sediments, 66% sediments, 33% sediments, 100% agronomic soil and 100% traditional peat based substrate. In each pot, one holm oak acorn was seeded. Germination and both physiological and morphological traits of the seedlings were analysed during and at the end of the first growing season. Holm oak grown in phytoremediated sediments at higher concentrations showed germination levels comparable to those in the traditional substrate, and survival capacity (especially in 66% sediments) slightly higher than in 100% soil. Physiological performance of seedlings resembled that on the traditional substrate which required the addition of fertilizer, at least for the first growing season. Seedlings grown in mixed substrates with higher sediment concentrations occasionally showed better photosynthetic capacity with improved connectivity between the units of the photosystem II. At the end of the first growing season, height as well as the number of growth flushes of the seedlings grown in sole sediment or soil-sediment substrates were similar to what generally is observed for forest nursery stock of Quercus spp.. Regarding the root system articulation and growth in depth, results in the mixed substrates were comparable to those for seedlings grown in the traditional forest nursery media, and higher than seedlings grown in 100% agronomic soil. According to our results, the reclamation of dredged sediments can provide appropriate nursery substrate for germination beds for forestry species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular fossils (biomarkers) are abundant in organic rich natural archives such as pests and lignites (fossilized peat), where their distribution is governed by their biological source, environmental factors, such as temperature and pH, and diagenetic reactions. As a result, biomarkers in peat have become an important tool to study past variations in vegetation, environment and climate in terrestrial settings, as well as biogeochemistry on time-scales of hundreds to millions of years ago. In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the controls on biomarker distributions, especially those derived from microorganisms and peat-forming plants, allowing for example, the quantification of past temperature and vegetation history during peat formation. Herein, we provide a review of a range of commonly applied biomarker proxies in peats, discuss the latest proxy developments, and explore the potential of using biomarkers in peat and lignite as paleoenvironmental proxies. We provide a framework for biomarker analyses in peat and identify possible future research directions.

AB Azorhizobium caulinodans strongly colonized the rhizosphere of rice plants after incorporation of Sesbania rostrata in a field trial throughout the growing season and during the fallow period until 19 weeks after incorporation of S. rostrata. A. caulinodans became well established in the rhizosphere (7.17 log cfu g(-1) dry rice root) and colonized subsequent S. rostrata test plants. Three traditional and three improved high-yielding rice varieties were inoculated with A. caulinodans under gnotobiotic conditions. In none of the combinations did acetylene reduction activity significantly increase. Ethylene production on colonized rice roots only started after the growth medium had been supplemented with an extra C source (0.1 to 0.25% Na-lactate). This indicates that the bacterial nitrogenase activity is limited by energy supply. Four possible inoculant-carriers (peat, coir dust, bagasse, rice straw) were compared for long-term survival of the bacterial strain. Independent of the storage temperature (26 degrees C or 4 degrees C), the survival of A. caulinodans in peat and coir dust was very high during a 12-month period (>8 log cfu g(-1) dry carrier), whereas the bagasse and rice straw carriers showed a serious decline from 3 months onwards.

AB The CO2 dynamics were measured in an organic soil in eastern Finland during the growing season and wintertime, and the annual CO2 balance was calculated for plots where barley or grass was grown. During the summer, the CO2 dynamics were measured by transparent and opaque chambers using a portable infrared gas analyser for the CO2 analyses. During the winter, the CO2 release was measured by opaque chambers analysing the samples in the laboratory with a gas chromatograph. Statistical response functions for CO2 dynamics were constructed to evaluate the annual CO2 exchange from the climatic data. The net CO2 exchange was calculated for every hour in the snow-free season. The carbon balance varied extensively depending on the weather conditions, and type and phenology of vegetation. During the growing season, the grassland was a net source while the barley field was a net sink for CO2. However, both soils were net sources for CO2 when autumn, winter and spring were included also. The annual CO2 emissions from the grassland and barley soil were 750 g CO2-C m(-2) and 400 g CO2-C m(-2), respectively. The carbon accumulated in root and shoot biomass during the growing season was 330 g m(-2) for grass and 520 g m(-2) for barley. The C in the aboveground plant biomass ranged from 43 to 47% of the carbon fixed in photosynthesis (P-G) and the proportion of C in the root biomass was 10% of the carbon fixed in photosynthesis. The bare soils had 10-60% higher net CO2 emission than the vegetated soils. These results indicate that the carbon balance of organic soils is affected by the characteristics of the prevailing plant cover. The dry summer of 1997 may have limited the growth of grass in the late summer thus reducing photosynthesis, which could be one reason for the high CO2 release from this grass field.

AB In nutrient-poor environments, plants employ many strategies to acquire and recycle scarce nutrients. Predictable relationships among a variety of leaf traits, including leaf nitrogen (N) suggest that how plants obtain, use, store and re-use N is a major component of plant fitness. The northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, receives nitrogen from multiple sources: NH(4) and NO(3) dissolved in precipitation; N mineralized from captured prey; the scant N in saturated peat; and N remobilized from storage. In two greenhouse experiments, we examined N cycling in S. purpurea and consider how these dynamics relate to prior observations that this carnivorous plant has an unusually low photosynthetic rate for its tissue N content.
   In the first experiment we assessed assimilation, translocation, storage and remobilization of (15)N supplied to pitchers and roots. In the second experiment, we examined how (15)N assimilated by the first pitcher produced at the start of the growing season contributed to the production and maintenance of subsequent pitchers, roots and rhizomes.
   Patterns of N cycling were similar at the individual-leaf and whole-plant level. Pitchers assimilated 55%-69% of available (15)N and served as both the largest sink for newly assimilated N (> 90% of the (15)N assimilated during 2004) and the largest source of N remobilization the following spring. In contrast, N assimilated by roots was low and accounted for < 2.5% of the overall S. purpurea N budget. Sarracenia purpurea used both stored N and newly-acquired N throughout the growing season. The importance of stored N decreased throughout the growing season as newly assimilated N contributed more to later pitcher production.
   Our detailed mechanistic analysis of nitrogen cycling dynamics of S. purpurea suggests why this plant has a low photosynthetic rate for its tissue N content. Excess nitrogen is stored for future use, and production of new pitchers is primarily aimed at enhancing prey capture rather than increasing photosynthetic tissue.

AB The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the relative importance of competition decreases and facilitation increases with an increase in abiotic stress. In peatlands, Sphagnum faces the threat of drought and differentiates into hummock species (drought-tolerant) and hollow species. Whether interspecific interaction affects the influence of drought on bryophyte composition in peatlands is unknown. We established an experiment by simulating drought and building bryophyte communities with two hummock species (S. palustre and S. capillifolium) and one hollow species (S. fallax). In all three species, drought decreased biomass production, height increment and side-shoot production. Sphagnum stores water in the hyaline cells, and leaf hyaline cell percentage (HCP) in the two hummock species increased with drought while no effect was found in S. fallax, suggesting that adjusting HCP is not an effective response to drought for the hollow species. Morphological traits and carbon and nitrogen contents in hummock species responded more to drought than in the hollow species, indicating a rapid response in phenotypic plasticity is an important strategy to resist drought in the hummock species. The presence of neighboring Sphagnum species, rather than drought, decreased carbon content for all three species. All three bryophytes showed interaction between drought and neighbor in two or more plant traits. Our study, however, did not support SGH, and there were no changes from competition under wet to facilitation under dry treatments in any of the six species combinations. On the contrary, when S. fallax was the target species, a change from facilitation under wet to competition under dry treatments was observed. The results suggest that hummock species can facilitate hollow species in wet environments but they could suppress hollow species under drought conditions by competing for water resources. Both drought and strong competition are the probable reasons why hollow species rarely grow in hummocks.

DE Zeta potential; decomposed peat; support vector machine; artificial
   neural networks
AB Zeta potential is crucial for practical applications in electrochemistry. However, the precise deterimination of zeta potential of decomposed peat is complex and has high requirements to related instructments. Previous study shows that zeta potential of decomposed peat can be predicted by back-propagation (BP) neural network. However, it lacks available comparisons and neglects the importance of the decomposed stages of peat and the required training times. Here, to extend this research, we propose a series of novel machine learning techniques including support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the zeta potential of decomposed peat. Four indicators including hydrated radius (nm), cation valence, concentration (mol/L) and pH are set as independent variables while zeta potential (mV) is set as the dependent variable. The SVM, general regression neural network (GRNN) and multilayer feed-forward neural networks (MLFNs) are developed in different decomposed stages, including the slightly decomposed peat, the highly decomposed peat and all decomposed peat. Results show that separating the models based on the decomposed stages have better prediction results than taking all decomposed peat in one model. During our studies, the SVM is the best model for the prediction to the slightly decomposed peat (RMS error: 2.37, training time: 1s), while the GRNN is the best model for the prediction to the highly decomposed peat (RMS error: 2.20, training time: 1s).

Suillus inoculum was applied at rates of 0.5; 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 litres per m(2), Inocybe inoculum at rates of 0.5 and 1.5 litres per m(2). Ar the end of the first growing season, all inoculation treatments showed a significantly greater mycorrhizal infection of bareroot seedlings compared to that found in both fumigated and unfumigated controls. The ectomycorrhizal 1-year-old seedlings were transplanted into containers. At the end of the second year, ectomycorrhizal infection of the 2-year-old container-grown seedlings was considerably less than that of the 1-year-old barerooted seedlings, probably as a consequence of too high fertility and/or insufficient porosity/aeration of pure pear moss medium. There was no difference in seedling growth between inoculated and uninoculated seedlings throughout the experiment.

Both media received Osmocote (15N-4P-7.5K-1.8Mg) at N rate of 0.8 g L(-1). Plant and media samples were taken at potting and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks. Most physical and chemical properties differed significantly (P <= 0.05) between media types. However, the media had limited or no effect on non-destructive plant measurements including diameter at the base of old shoots, length of longest new shoots, number of flowers and new shoots, crown volume, leaf colour, and disease incidence. Plants grown in the peat-reduced medium, however, produced greater dry mass and had a higher K concentration and content in flowers, roots, old and new shoots. In contrast, the concentrations and contents of N and Mg were higher in the peat-grown plants with no significant difference in P. Therefore, amending peat with 40% substrate-compost [type I] resulted in plants with similar growth appearances as compared to the pure peat but differed in the nutritional status.

AB The leaching of nitrogen from fallow, fertilized and unfertilized spring barley, and grass ley was studied in a 4-year lysimeter experiment carried out on clay, silt and sand soils, and Carex peat. The experimental factors included also irrigation and treatments where the nitrogen fertilizer was applied in the first year as N-15-labelled ammonium nitrate.
   During four years, 41-66% of the nitrogen applied in the first growing season was recovered in plants harvested. Most of it, 91-96%, was taken up in the year applied.
   Mostly, the water drainage was lowest in silt and sand soils. The irrigation increased clearly the leaching of nitrogen almost in all treatments. Crops decreased the drainage of water through the lysimeters and the leaching of nitrogen, grass more than barley.
   The effects of plants and irrigation were similar in all soils, but most marked in sand. The largest amount of nitrogen was leached in irrigated, fallowed sand, 440 kg ha-1, during four years.
   The majority of the leached nitrogen was nitrate. Only in peat soil a significant amount of nitrogen was leached in some another form.
   The leaching of N-15-labelled fertilizer during four years was highest in sand, 2.3 kg ha-1 of N or 2.3% of the nitrogen applied in the first experimental year.

AB Selected Tertiary coals from the Zeya-Buryea Basin, Far Eastern Russia, were investigated for aspects of their coal type, rank, depositional environment and post-depositional history. The coals have been examined in outcrop (lithotype logging), microscopically (maceral, reflectance and fluorescence), and geochemically (proximate analysis). Two laterally extensive coal-bearing horizons occur: one of Palaeocene age and the other of early Miocene age. The Palaeocene coals were investigated in active open-cut mines at Raichikhinsk and Yerkovtsi and the early Miocene deposit in an abandoned open-cut mine at Cergeyevka. Palaeocene coals at Raichikhinsk and Yerkovtsi were indistinguishable from each other macroscopically, microscopically, and geochemically. The deposits were sufficiently coalified that brightness logging could be undertaken. Dull coals, with numerous fusainous wisps, were dominant. Four dulling-up sequences, which represent stacked peat deposits, were observed at Raichikhinsk. At Yerkovtsi, only a small section of the middle of the seam, which was mostly dull and muddy coal, was investigated. Petrographically, these coals were dominated by inertinite group macerals, which is unusual in non-Gondwanan coals and rare in the Tertiary. Rank classification was problematic with volatile matter (VM) content of vitrain (daf), macroscopic appearance, and microscopic textures suggesting subbituminous B rank, but carbon content, moisture content and specific energy indicating a lignite rank. Notwithstanding complications of rank, estimates of the maximum-range burial depths were calculated. Taking the VM (daf) content of vitrain as 48%, burial depth estimates range from 900 m for a high geothermal gradient and long heating time to a maximum of 3300 in for a low geothermal gradient and short heating time. These estimates are maxima as the coal rank may be lower than implied by the VM. The Cergeyevka deposit is a soft brown coal. Limited sampling of the upper-most portion indicated a high moisture content (75% daf) and an unusual, hydrogen-rich geochemistry. Lack of identifiable liptinites using either reflected light or fluorescence microscopy suggested a significant bituminite component. Otherwise, the coals appear to be typical for the Tertiary. An estimate of 125 in maximum burial depth was obtained using the bed-moisture content of the coal, which is around the present burial depth. Comparison of present-day thicknesses with inferred burial depths suggests that at least 500 in of section is missing between the Palaeocene coals and the early Miocene coals. Palaeoenvironmental considerations suggest that fire played a significant role in the accumulation of the peats at Raichikhinsk and Yerkovtsi. At Cergeyevka, peat accumulation ended by drowning of the mire. Two tuff beds were recognised within the seam at Raichikhinsk and one in the seam at Yerkovtsi. Correlation of the tuff beds is uncertain but they should prove useful in regional coal seam correlation and interpreting coal depositional environments. Geochemical analysis by XRF was complicated by high loss-on-ignition (LOI) values. Despite extensive alteration, an acid igneous source is implied from the presence of free quartz and TiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 0.02 to 0.05. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands globally are highly threatened by agriculture, and damage associated with it, such as invasion by alien species and the impacts of fertilizers and pesticides. South African palmiet wetlands make an interesting case study to investigate this, as they are valuable valley-bottom, peat-forming systems, highly threatened by agricultural development. Currently most agriculture in these palmiet wetlands is marginal (low agricultural productivity) due to the challenges of farming a system that experiences severe floods and erodes rapidly, forming gullies, when wetland vegetation is disturbed. The current situation seems to be a lose-lose situation for nature and society. We aimed to assess this conflict between water-related services and agriculture objectively by comparing provision of fifteen ecosystem services by degraded and pristine sections of three palmiet wetlands using a rapid ecosystem service assessment tool (WET-Ecoservices). To validate this technique, we compared results to those obtained from examining three key ecosystem service complexes in slightly more detail. We found that pristine palmiet wetlands provide valuable ecosystem services to society, which are currently being compromised for private, marginal agricultural gain. These pristine wetlands sequester between 21 and 41 g.m(-2) of carbon per year, have nitrogen and phosphorus uptake efficiencies of 62-85% and 16-89% respectively, and provide about 16 times more flood attenuation relative to degraded ones. The full impact of degradation on wetland ecosystem services was not entirely captured by the rapid ecosystem service assessment tool: WET-Ecoservices. We suggest some adaptations to this tool for the valley-bottom wetland hydro-geomorphic unit. Overall, these wetlands have high potential for incorporation into a Payments for Ecosystem Services scheme, due to the ecosystem services provided and their position above important municipal dams. We recommend collaboration between private landowners struggling with marginal agriculture, and decision makers in cities dealing with water shortages and debt to ensure the most efficient and judicious use of these palmiet wetland ecosystem services.

AB When the substrate surface and drainage holes of feather fiber, peat, and plastic containers were sealed with wax, hyperbolic growth curves were good fits to cumulative water loss on a per container and per cm(2) basis, with R-2 values ranging from 0.88 to 0.96. The effect of container type was significant as the differences in asymptotic maximum water loss (max) values for all container pairs were significant at P < 0.05 for both water loss per container and water loss per cm(2). The predicted total water loss for peat containers was approximate to2.5 times greater than feather containers, and the predicted water loss per cm(2) for the peat container was approximate to3 times greater than feather containers. Vinca [Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don.]'Cooler Blush' and impatiens (Impatiens walleriana Hook f.) 'Dazzler Rose Star' plants grown in feather and peat containers required more water and more frequent irrigations than those grown in plastic containers. However, plants grown in feather containers required less water and fewer irrigations than plants grown in peat containers. The surface area of containers covered by algal or fungal growth was significantly higher on peat containers than on feather containers. No fungal or algal growth was observed on plastic containers. Additionally, primarily algae were observed on peat containers whereas most discoloration observed on feather containers was due to fungal growth. Dry feather containers had a higher longitudinal strength than dry plastic containers but a lower longitudinal strength than dry peat containers. Wet feather containers had higher longitudinal strength than wet peat containers but a similar longitudinal strength as wet plastic containers. Dry feather and plastic containers had similar lateral strengths and both had significantly higher lateral strength than dry peat containers. Wet feather containers had significantly lower lateral strength than wet plastic containers but had higher lateral strength than wet peat containers. Dry and, wet plastic containers had higher punch strength than wet or dry peat and feather containers. Dry peat containers had significantly higher punch strength than dry feather containers. However, wet feather containers had significantly higher punch strength than wet peat containers. Decomposition of peat and feather containers was significantly affected by container type and the species grown in the container. When planted with tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum L.) 'Better Boy', decomposition was not significantly different between the peat and feather containers. However, when vinca and marigold (Tagetes patula L.) 'Janie Bright Yellow' were grown in the containers, decomposition was significantly higher for feather containers than for peat containers. Therefore, containers made from processed feather fiber provided a new type of biodegradable container with significantly improved characteristics as compared to peat containers.

AB Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used on a data set of 112 species from 14 stands dominated by Salix planifolia and/or S. monticola. Environmental variables were determined which might be important to explain differences in stand vegetation composition, and willow stature (height), in willow carrs in the Rocky Mountain National Park. Correlation of environmental variables with DCA stand scores indicate that peat depth and soil redox potential are highly related to the primary DCA axis. Soils in stands of S. planifolia are more reduced in the early summer and have greater peat depths, than soils in stands of S. monticola. The second DCA axis is related to a water chemistry gradient of hydrogen ion, sulphate, and ammonium concentration. Four environmental variables selected by correlation analysis were regressed on stand scores from the first two DCA axes. Regression coefficients of August soil redox potential and soil water pH were significantly non-zero on the primary DCA axis. In addition to overall vegetation relationships elucidated by DCA, the relationships between willow stature and environmental variables were tested by simultaneous ANOVAs. ANOVA results and DCA ordinations indicate that S. planifolia and S. monticola plants achieve the greatest stature in the least reduced soils, and in shallow peat. Competitive, stress' tolerant, and ruderal plant strategy theory applied to the vegetation data produced an arrangement of stands highly correlated to the DCA Axis 1 stand arrangement. These correlations indicate that the primary axis of vegetation structure can be extracted either by species composition, or species morphology/physiology relationships. Concurrent use of DCA and plant strategy theory is suggested as a tool for the prediction of community composition.

Although P-eutrophication may strongly decrease biodiversity in rich fens, some well-developed habitats do still survive in highly fertilized regions due to nutrient filtering services of large wetlands. The occurrence of such nutrient gradients is well-known, but the biogeochemical mechanisms that determine these patterns are often unclear. We therefore analyzed chemical speciation and binding of relevant nutrients and minerals in surface waters, soils and plants along such gradients in the large Ramsar nature reserve Weerribben-Wieden in the Netherlands.
   P-availability was lowest in relatively isolated floating rich fens, where plant N:P ratios indicated P-limitation. P-limitation can persist here despite high P-concentrations in surface waters near the peripheral entry locations, because only a small part of the P-input reaches the more isolated waters and fens. This pattern in P-availability appears to be primarily due to precipitation of Fe-phosphates, which mainly occurs close to entry locations as indicated by decreasing concentrations of Fe- and Al-bound P in the sub-aquatic sediments along this gradient. A further decrease of P-availability is caused by biological sequestration, which occurs throughout the wetland as indicated by equal concentrations of organic P in all sub-aquatic sediments.
   Our results clearly show that the periphery of large wetlands does indeed act as an efficient P-filter, sustaining the necessary P-limitation in more isolated parts. However, this filtering function does harm the ecological quality of the peripheral parts of the reserve. The filtering mechanisms, such as precipitation of Fe-phosphates and biological uptake of P, are crucial for the conservation and restoration of biodiverse rich fens in wetlands that receive eutrophic water from their surroundings. This seems to implicate that biodiverse wetland vegetation requires larger areas, as long as eutrophication has not been seriously tackled. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Archived soil samples can provide important information on the history of environmental contamination and by comparison with recently collected samples, temporal trends can be inferred. Little previous work has addressed whether mercury (Hg) concentrations in soil samples are stable with long-term storage under standard laboratory conditions. In this study, we have re-analyzed using cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy a set of archived soil samples that ranged from relatively pristine mountainous sites to a polluted site near a non-ferrous metal smelter with a wide range of Hg concentrations (6.7-6485 mu g kg(-1)). Samples included organic and mineral soils and peats with a carbon content that ranged from 0.2 to 47.7%. Soil samples were stored in polyethylene bags or bottles and held in laboratory rooms where temperature was not kept to a constant value. Mercury concentrations in four subsets of samples were originally measured in 2000, 2005, 2006 and 2007, and re-analyzed in 2017, i.e. after 17, 12, 11 and 10 years of storage. Statistical analyses of either separated or lumped data yielded no significant differences between the original and current Hg concentrations. Based on these analyses, we show that archived soil and peat samples can be used to evaluate historical soil mercury contamination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peat soils comprise a large part of the western and northern Netherlands. Drainage for agriculture has caused increased soil aeration which has stimulated decomposition and, hence, soil subsidence, currently amounting to 1-2 cm/yr. River water is supplied to these peat areas in summer to prevent drying out of the peat soils. Saltwater intrusion and evaporation make this surface water slightly brackish during drought periods. In addition, brackish seepage can surface more easily during such dry periods. We performed an incubation experiment in which the effects of salinization on aerobic decomposition and mineralization of shallow peat samples and anaerobic decomposition and mineralization of deep peat samples were studied. We considered four different types of peat samples: peat sampled in agricultural peat meadows and in nature reserves, originally formed under either eutrophic or oligotrophic conditions. The aerobic decomposition was approximately reduced by 50% after salinization, whereas the anaerobic decomposition rates remained unchanged. Remarkably, the response to salinization did not differ between the peat types and land uses. Ammonium concentrations increased while nitrate concentrations decreased after salinization, probably as a result of reduced nitrification. Especially in the oligotrophic peat, ammonium concentrations increased substantially. Phosphate concentrations increased, possibly caused by changes in desorption and adsorption processes due to higher ion concentrations. DOC concentrations decreased in the brackish samples due to precipitation. Furthermore, the eutrophic peat samples showed increasing sulfate concentrations, both in oxic and anoxic incubations, which was attributed to pyrite oxidation. Independently of salinization, nitrification rates were higher in the agricultural, fertilized, peat soils. In conclusion, while salinization might reduce subsidence rates, it will have adverse effects on water quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A field control experiment was carried out to determine the influence of water table changes on soil CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in Calamagrostis angustifolia freshwater marsh in Northeast of China. The results showed that the water depth of 5 cm below the ground surface increased soil CO2 emission, but there was no significant influence of deeper water table on gas emission. CH4 emission was accelerated by deep standing water and approached the peak in the plant booming time. This suggests that root activity has influence on CH4 production. The result also demonstrated that both low water table level and inundated environment would inhibit N2O emission. Comparing the total global warming potential of three gases under different conditions, it can be concluded that maintaining a comparatively steady water table near the soil surface can benefit soil carbon sequestration in the C. angustifolia marsh, and decrease of the greenhouse gases emissions to the atmosphere.

AB Peat hydrolysates prepared with and without acid and under various temperatures were tested in the growth of the yeast Phaffia rhodozyma ATCC 24202, which synthesizes carotenoids, including astaxanthin. The hydrolysate that resulted in the best growth of P. rhodozyma biomass was subsequently used as substrate for the submerged culture of the yeast, and the growth conditions were optimized. Those studied included initial substrate concentration, initial pH, incubation temperature, fermentation time and agitation rate. The optimum growth conditions produced approximately 4.6 g dm-3 of dry biomass with a crude protein content of 47% (dry weight basis). The mean astaxanthin content of the yeast cultivated under these conditions, 1567 mug g-1 dry yeast, was also the highest produced in this work, and compares favourably with other results reported in the literature.

AB Recent climate change on the Antarctic Peninsula is well documented [1-5], with warming, alongside increases in precipitation, wind strength, and melt season length [1, 6, 7], driving environmental change [8, 9]. However, meteorological records mostly began in the 1950s, and paleoenvironmental datasets that provide a longer-term context to recent climate change are limited in number and often from single sites [7] and/or discontinuous in time [10, 11]. Here we use moss bank cores from a 600-km transect from Green Island (65.3 degrees S) to Elephant Island (61.1 degrees S) as paleoclimate archives sensitive to regional temperature change, moderated by water availability and surface microclimate [12, 13]. Mosses grow slowly, but cold temperatures minimize decomposition, facilitating multiproxy analysis of preserved peat [14]. Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) in cellulose indicates the favorability of conditions for photosynthesis [15]. Testate amoebae are representative heterotrophs in peatlands [16-18], so their populations are an indicator of microbial productivity [14]. Moss growth and mass accumulation rates represent the balance between growth and decomposition [19]. Analyzing these proxies in five cores at three sites over 150 years reveals increased biological activity over the past ca. 50 years, in response to climate change. We identified significant changepoints in all sites and proxies, suggesting fundamental and widespread changes in the terrestrial biosphere. The regional sensitivity of moss growth to past temperature rises suggests that terrestrial ecosystems will alter rapidly under future warming, leading to major changes in the biology and landscape of this iconic region-an Antarctic greening to parallel well-established observations in the Arctic [20].

AB The thermal decomposition of peat in a drop tube furnace was studied under conditions typical of the low-temperature combustion chambers of industrial heat-generating plants, and the combustion of peat charcoal was examined on a thermogravimetric analyzer with dynamic heating. It was established that the thermal properties of peat are well combined with the properties of woody biomass, primarily, with coniferous wood (spruce and pine). The main differences are that the process of peat pyrolysis occurred in a wider temperature range and two extremum points at temperatures of 277 and 320 degrees C were observed in this case.

AB This study focuses on the Pleistocene Golbasi-Harmanh coal deposit located in the East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ), SE Turkey. The principal aim of the study is to determine factors that controlled peat accumulation by means of palaeontological data, routine coal analyses (proximate-ultimate), mineralogical composition based on XRD and SEM-EDX, and coal petrography. The basin-infillings consist of alluvial, fluvial, and lacustrine sediments. Palaeolake levels along with sedimentation were presumably controlled by the EAFZ during Late Pliocene to Holocene times. The investigated coal-bearing zone is composed of a thick coal seam (up to 39 m) with thin clastic intercalations of fossiliferous claystones. Palaeontological data from these clastic bands imply that the coal accumulated during Middle Pleistocene times, an uncommon period for the formation of thick coals in Turkey.
   We suggest that the movements of the EAFZ caused rapid subsidence, and along with favourable climatic conditions, allowed large peat accumulation in a relatively short period of time. The results of proximate and ultimate analyses from 29 coal samples obtained from two cores show high ash yields (av. 32%), relatively low sulphur content (av. 1.8%), low net calorific value (av. 11.6 MJ/kg) and low total carbon content (av. 35.5%) on an air-dry basis. The mean random reflectances of eu-ulminite B indicate a low-rank coal. Maceral compositions and maceral indices indicate that the peat accumulated under limno-telmatic, mesotrophic conditions, with peat forming vegetation being composed of mainly herbaceous plants.
   Ostracoda and Mollusca fauna from intercalating clastic layers within the coal seam provide important information about the geographic distribution of fossil taxa, environmental evaluation of the intercalations, and the age of the studied coal seam. The Ostracoda species Gomphocythere geareyi was identified within the coal seam for the first time. Humphcypris subterranea is the first fossil record of this Ostracoda genus in Turkey. These, along with the presence of the Gastropoda subspecies Bithynia phialensis syriaca, imply a transport into the palaeomire via migratory birds from the Eastern Mediterranean areas. Discovery of Humphcypris subterranea, Bithynia phialensis syriaca, and the African originated genus Gomphocythere in the Giilbasi-Harmanh coal deposit marks their northernmost worldwide occurrence.

AB Around the world, peatland degradation and soil subsidence is occurring where these soils have been converted to agriculture. Since initial drainage in the mid-1800s, continuous farming of such soils in the California Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta) has led to subsidence of up to 8 meters in places, primarily due to soil organic matter (SOM) oxidation and physical compaction. Rice (Oryza sativa) production has been proposed as an alternative cropping system to limit SOM oxidation. Preliminary research on these soils revealed high N uptake by rice in N fertilizer omission plots, which we hypothesized was the result of SOM oxidation releasing N. Testing this hypothesis, we developed a novel N budgeting approach to assess annual soil C and N loss based on plant N uptake and fallow season N mineralization. Through field experiments examining N dynamics during growing season and winter fallow periods, a complete annual N budget was developed. Soil C loss was calculated from SOM-N mineralization using the soil C:N ratio. Surface water and crop residue were negligible in the total N uptake budget (3-4 % combined). Shallow groundwater contributed 24-33 %, likely representing subsurface SOM-N mineralization. Assuming 6 and 25 kg N ha-1 from atmospheric deposition and biological N2 fixation, respectively, our results suggest 77-81% of plant N uptake (129-149 kg N ha(-1)) was supplied by SOM mineralization. Considering a range of N uptake efficiency from 50-70 %, estimated net C loss ranged from 1149-2473 kg C ha(-1). These findings suggest that rice systems, as currently managed, reduce the rate of C loss from organic delta soils relative to other agricultural practices.

TI The effect of a biochar temperature series on denitrification: which

AB Biochar has been shown to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils, but the effect is highly variable across studies and the mechanisms are under debate. To improve our mechanistic understanding of biochar effects on N2O emission, we monitored kinetics of NO, N2O and N-2 accumulation in anoxic slurries of a peat and a mineral soil, spiked with nitrate and amended with feedstock dried at 105 degrees C and biochar produced at 372, 416, 562 and 796 C at five different doses. Both soils accumulated consistently less N2O and NO in the presence of high -temperature chars (BC562 and BC796), which stimulated reduction of denitrification intermediates to N-2, particularly in the acid peat. This effect appeared to be strongly linked to the degree of biochar carbonisation as predicted by the H:C ratio of the char. In addition, biochar surface area and pH were identified as important factors, whereas ash content and CEC played a minor role. At low pyrolysis temperature, the biochar effect was soil dependent, suppressing N2O accumulation in the mineral soil, but enhancing it in the peat soil. This contrast was likely due to the labile carbon content of low temperature chars, which contributed to immobilise N in the mineral soil, but stimulated denitrification and N2O emission in the peat soil. We conclude that biochar with a high degree of carbonisation, high pH and high surface area is best suited to supress N2O emission from denitrification, while low temperature chars risk supporting incomplete denitrification.

AB Improved survival of peat-cultured rhizobia compared to survival of liquid-cultured cells has been attributed to cellular adaptations during solid-state fermentation in moist peat. We have observed improved desiccation tolerance of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii TA1 and Bradyrhizobium japonicum CB1809 after aerobic growth in water extracts of peat. Survival of TA1 grown in crude peat extract was 18-fold greater than that of cells grown in a defined liquid medium but was diminished when cells were grown in different-sized colloidal fractions of peat extract. Survival of CB1809 was generally better when grown in crude peat extract than in the control but was not statistically significant (P > 0.05) and was strongly dependent on peat extract concentration. Accumulation of intracellular trehalose by both TA1 and CB1809 was higher after growth in peat extract than in the defined medium control. Cells grown in water extracts of peat exhibit morphological changes similar to those observed after growth in moist peat. Electron microscopy revealed thickened plasma membranes, with an electron-dense material occupying the periplasmic space in both TA1 and CB1809. Growth in peat extract also resulted in changes to polypeptide expression in both strains, and peptide analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated increased expression of stress response proteins. Our results suggest that increased capacity for desiccation tolerance in rhizobia is multifactorial, involving the accumulation of trehalose together with increased expression of proteins involved in protection of the cell envelope, repair of DNA damage, oxidative stress responses, and maintenance of stability and integrity of proteins.

AB Erosion of deposited organic peat sediments from peat harvesting ditches was studied in both laboratory and field conditions. Peat sediments were placed in a recirculation flume at controlled pH levels and allowed to stabilize from 15 min to 10 d. Afterward, different flow velocities were applied and the peat erosion was measured. The erosion rate was related to the physical properties of peat: the particle size and form, settling velocity, peat type and degree of decomposition (von Post). The mean average settling velocity for the peat was measured to be 0.87 m h(-1). The median sediment particle size was 42 mm, which indicates that the peat sediment is partly cohesive. The deposited sediment formed a loose layer overlaid by more stabilized layers. Critical shear stress for the surface of the loose peat layer was 0.01 N m(-2) and for the more consolidated layer was 0.059 N m(-2) after a stabilization of three days. The erosion coefficients determined during laboratory study varied between 3.7.10(-4) and 4.1.10(-6) kg m(-2) s(-1). The determined erosion and sedimentation rates were used to calibrate sediment erosion and deposition models. A new approach was then developed for the uses of these models to simulate peat sediment delivery from field ditches. The model was tested against measured values which were in accordance to observed sediment transport rates.

AB Soil carbon and nutrients play vital roles in ecosystem services. Many previous studies documented carbon or nutrient accumulation and the relevant impacting factors, and emphasized the soil physical structure, especially soil aggregates, that might play a key role in grasslands or farmlands. Unfortunately, there is little known about the relationship between soil aggregates and nutrient sequestration in fens and which soil aggregate type contributes most strongly to the soil nutrient cycle in fens. In this study, we collected 180 soil samples from 3 sites and then tested the changes in soil nutrient contents and carbon sequestration rates based on soil aggregate fractions from a fen that has critical implications for temperate wetland ecosystems in Northeast China. This fen soil is obviously characterized with macroaggregate and microaggregate structures. For this soil, the mean weight diameter (MWD) ranged from 0.42 to 0.61 mm and the geometric mean diameter (GMD) ranged from 0.82 to 0.90 mm, and there were fluctuations for both MWD and GMD along with soil depth. The correlation analysis showed that macroaggregates were more closely related to carbon sequestration (p < 0.01) and stable soil microaggregates were important for nutrient conservation (p < 0.01) in this fen. The sequestration rates of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were 87.64 +/- 10.88 gC m(-2) yr(-1), 3.43 +/- 0.54 gN m(-2) yr(-1), and 0.17 +/- 0.02 gP M-2 yr(-1), respectively. Additionally, the characteristic stoichiometric balance was related to the aggregate size and there were four distinct intervals for both the C/N ratio and C/P ratio; three intervals were located in similar ranges for the C/N ratio and C/P ratio (12-14 cm, 20-22 cm, and 28-30 cm) which means three of these areas coincided with the C/P ratio that characterizes the phosphorus conversion intensity index. The findings indicate that soil aggregates play key roles in soil carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling within wetlands.

AB 1. Molinia encroachment has been viewed as a major threat to moorland conservation in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. In England and Wales agri-environment schemes are in place that aim to reduce Molinia caerulea and encourage the development of dwarf shrub vegetation. We tested a range of management treatments to achieve these objectives in two regions (the North Peaks and Yorkshire Dales) in England.
   2. Within each region, the same experiment was carried out on two types of moorland vegetation, Molinia-dominated 'white' moorland and a mixture of Molinia and Calluna vulgaris'grey' moorland. Burning, grazing and herbicide (glyphosate) treatments were applied in factorial combination at each of the four sites (two regions x two moor types). The responses of both vegetation and individual species were assessed. In addition, on the white moors two techniques for Calluna re-establishment were investigated, (i) removal of Molinia litter by raking and (ii) application of Calluna seed.
   3. The data were analysed using a combination of univariate and multivariate analysis of variance to identify trends in this complex data set.
   4. The only treatment that had consistent effects in the univariate analysis of variance was glyphosate application, which had similar effects on Molinia at all study sites. There was little difference between the use of low and high application rates (0.27 and 0.54 kg ai ha(-1)). There was little impact of herbicide use on other moorland species. Some species were affected on some sites in some years, but there were no consistent effects. Tentative identification of species that responded positively, negatively and erratically to glyphosate application was made.
   5. Greater Calluna seedling densities were found in the plots where herbicide was applied, the Molinia litter was removed and seed was added. However, after initial colonization, there was a reduction in Calluna seedling densities as the Molinia recovered. This indicated that disturbance, seed addition and follow-up management are required for successful Calluna establishment.
   6. There were significant differences in community response between both the regions and moorland types. The Dales had a relatively greater contribution of grassland species than the Peaks, where the grey site had a relatively greater dwarf shrub component.
   7. Burning had little effect on community composition but both grazing and herbicide application had important effects. Grazing of the grey sites, even at the very low levels used in this study, tended to push the communities towards bog-moorland vegetation, but little effect was found at the white sites. Glyphosate treatment tended to push communities towards acidic grassland at the Dales grey site but not at the Peaks. Successional change was also noted, with marked change between the third and fourth year and again between the fifth and six year. Grey sites showed the greatest temporal change.
   8. Synthesis and applications. In terms of Molinia control and subsequent restoration of dwarf shrubs, there was marked variability of response between 'apparently similar' vegetation types in different regions. There were abrupt temporal changes taking place some years after treatment application and a significant length of time was required for change to be detected. Managers need to obtain a greater knowledge of initial floristic composition before starting the restoration process, be prepared to accept multiple outcomes of response (acid grassland vs. dwarf shrubs), be prepared for a long-term monitoring process and perhaps the inclusion of additional treatments for continued Molinia control (application of selective graminicides) and dwarf shrub restoration (disturbance and seed addition treatments).

AB The fractional group composition of humic substances and the chemical structure of humic acids isolated from peats of different genesis from different depths of occurrence in peat deposits with the use of two extractants (0.1 N NaOH and 0.1 M Na4P2O7 at pH 7) were studied. Peat from the upper aerated layer of the peat deposits contained more humic substances than peat from the deep layer, which occurred under anaerobic conditions, due to the pyrophosphate fraction of humic acids and fulvic acids. The humic acids of peat isolated from the deep layers of deposits had smaller molecular weights, and they were characterized by lower concentrations of carbohydrate and saturated hydrocarbon fragments and an increased contribution of aromatic polyconjugation systems, as compared with the humic acids of a surface layer.

ID QUANTITATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; VEGETATION
AB Pollen analysis in relation to archaeological excavations has been carried out by the coast of central Norway to investigate for the first time long-term human impact on the vegetation in this region. A total of 297 samples from eleven archaeological sites and connected bogs/peat profiles reveal the vegetation development from the Mesolithic until today. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify and elucidate the development through time and space, and the results of pollen diagrams from bogs are compared to the results of on-site pollen data. Human impact has transformed the vegetation to a varying degree in different time periods. A dense population connected to the shoreline is slightly visible as opening-up of the forest in the Mesolithic, whereas re-use of Mesolithic settlement sites for cultivation and grazing in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age (from c. 2300 cal BC) is clearly documented by palaeobotany but weakly recorded in the archaeological record. Areas for settlement and cultivation are found from the Late Bronze and Iron Ages and pollen analysis contributes to a detailed picture of utilization of the landscape. The investigation shows the potential of combining archaeological and botanical data and analysing several small pollen sequences within an excavation area to reveal spatial patterns in vegetation development and human impact through time.

It was found that the yield of bitumens increased upon the alkylation of peat because of the occurrence of esterification, transesterification, and degradation reactions. The degradation of organomineral complexes was observed in the course of alkylation.

AB The analysis of long-term changes of mean annual temperatures and the active temperature sum over 80 years was carried out using data of the Khatanga meteorological station. Since the 1990s, an essential warming was observed, especially after 2000. The warming influence on vegetation takes place immediately (the ecosystem composition changes due to the degradation of cryogenic processes) as well as directly by increasing the time of the vegetation period and the total amount of heat on plants. As a result, in the last few years, the lead of phenological phenomena terms is observed - the time of foliage expansion and efflorescence of plants-indicators, geese arriving, mosquitos appearance, ice thawing. By long term monitoring data, the moving of some north-taiga plant species to forest tundra and tundra is observed, as well as their establishing in vegetation communities. However, at this moment, the character of the vegetation is stable. The occurrence of taiga animals is increased in tundra and forest tundra. An active revival of larch is observed in forest tundra and north sparse forests. A removing forest border to the north is not observed, but in the southern mountains of Taimyr its replacing on higher levels could be seen. A decreasing summer precipitation quantity increases the possibility of forest fires, spring and bog drying. It influences negatively on bog flora and near-water fauna. It is possible, that the main reason of the local climate change at the East of Taimyr is less connected to the global planet change, but much more to pulsations of the strong Siberian anticyclone.

AB Dartmoor Vlei is a 42 ha unchannelled valley-bottom wetland located in the headwaters of the Mnyamvubu River in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. The wetland and its catchment are underlain by a large dolerite sill that forms the Karkloof escarpment and plateau and the wetland terminates against a dolerite dyke that has intruded into the sill. The dolerite sill has been deeply weathered to depths in excess of 7 m, while the dolerite dyke at the toe of the wetland has not weathered such that water flows across bedrock at a depth of <0.2 m as it leaves the wetland. Coring established that the sedimentary fill overlying the weathered dolerite sill is generally <1 m thick, comprising upward fining sequences of sediment characterised by thin layers of sand and gravel at the contact with the weathered dolerite, which grade upwards into fine organic-rich silt sediments and peat at the surface. The wetland is characterised by a discontinuous stream. These findings confirm that the wetland evolved from a floodplain wetland characterised by laterally migrating meanders into a valley-bottom wetland characterised by peat accumulation with a discontinuous stream. The occurrence of a discontinuity between the residual saprolite beneath the wetland and fresh dolerite at the toe of the wetland indicates that the residual saprolite surface has sagged relative to the dolerite dyke. Chemical and mineralogical analyses of fresh and weathered dolerite confirmed that the chemical transformation of the dolerite sill bedrock into weathered products has resulted in both volume and thickness losses in the weathered dolerite sill mass. This has in turn resulted in sagging of the wetland surface over time, which was greatest at the head of the wetland and thus reduced the longitudinal slope downstream. This explains the extremely low energy conditions of Dartmoor Vlei and why the wetland is no longer shaped by lateral migration of meandering streams. The extensive chemical weathering of the dolerite sill underlying the wetland is attributed to the extremely long-time period that soils within the wetland have been saturated, given its occurrence on the African Erosion Surface.

AB Two drill cores with coal-bearing sediments from the localities Lukasberg and Kalletsberg of the Hausruck area were investigated. Particular attention was paid to the elastic intercalations between and within the coal seams to complete the previous database of the coal-petrological and geochemical analyses of the coals made by Gruber and Sachsenhofer (1999) and Bechtel et al. (2003). In this work, pollen and spores, the acid-resistant organic components (palynofacies), and the total organic carbon content (TOC) of the elastic sediments have been examined in order to interpret the palaecological conditions of the different plant habitats. The TOC and structured components of the Lukasberg site displayed a recurring cyclicity between coal seams and are interpreted as frequent changes of the depositional environment: coal swamps and peat bogs, lacustrine conditions (lake or pond) and marshes or clastic swamps. It is therefore assumed that the Hausruck area, particularly at the Lukasberg locality, was subjected to periodical submersions, in which the ground-water level repeatedly flooded the coal swamps. This cyclicity is unfortunately not clearly documented at the Kalletsberg locality. In addition, the occurrence of up to 32% fusinite in the palynofacies from some samples of both sites and charred logs at the Lukasberg open cast mine indicate the presence of palaeo-wildfires within forests of the Hausruck area. The age of the sedimentary succession is late Sarmatian to the early/middle Pannonian (upper Middle Miocene to lower Upper Miocene). The frequent occurrences of pollen of Mastixia, a warmth loving plant, which during this time interval occurred sporadically and in low numbers, suggest that the Hausruck was a relict area with a particular humid and warm climate.

AB The latitudinal tree cover gradient is an important characteristic of the tundra-taiga transition zone stretching around the northern hemisphere. Accurately mapped continuous tree cover fields would enable the depiction of forest extent over this ecotone, which is sensitive to climate change, natural disturbances and human activities. The objective of this study was to assess the explanatory power of multispectral, -temporal and -angular MODIS data to estimate tree cover at the regional scale in northernmost Finland. The standard MODIS BRDF/Albedo (MOD43B) data products at approximately 1 km resolution were used. The tree cover was estimated using generalized linear models (GLM), which were calibrated and evaluated by high resolution biotope inventory data. The benefit of coupling the multispectral, -temporal and -angular variables was assessed by variation partitioning. The predicted tree cover fields were also used for the forest-non-forest classification over a larger region and compared with the forest extent of Finnish CORINE land cover 2000 data set. The results show that multitemporal and -angular variables can increase the accuracy of the tree cover estimates and mapping of the forest extent in comparison to the peak of the growing season nadir-view multispectral data. The season of the data acquisition also affect the model performance, the late-spring and early-summer data being superior to mid- and late-summer data. Although the pure effect of the multiangular variables i.e. the parameters of the MODIS BRDF model and selected multiangular indices were relatively small in the models, the inclusion of these data increased the accuracy of the tree cover estimates in the mires in comparison to the peak of the growing season nadir-view multispectral data and multitemporal variables.

AB Breakdown mechanisms and flow characteristics involved in a peat bed treating oil-in-water emulsions have not yet been understood fully. This paper examines the applicability of the well-known Carman-Kozeny filtration equation to a 1000 mm peat bed treating a standard mineral oil-in-water emulsion at six different flow rates. The specific permeability coefficient, the Carman-Kozeny constant and the shape factor of peat were found to be 5.3 x 10(-11) m2, 3.4 and 2.2, respectively.
   Assuming the impaction-interception mechanism to predominate, the overall coalescence efficiency of the peat bed was evaluated. The effects of flow rates and depths of peat bed on coalescence efficiency were analyzed. Contrary to the general trends observed by other investigators, coalescence efficiency decreased with an increase in bed depth (from 14% at 200 mm depths to 3% at 1000 mm depth) indicating possible simultaneous occurrence of filtration and coalescence in the peat bed.

TI A note on measuring the hydraulic conductivity of peat in the field for
   land drainage
SO IRISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE drainage; hydraulic conductivity; peat
AB The selection of the hydraulic conductivity (K) of compressible peat for use in the design of drain spacing depends on: (i) whether the peat is drained or undrained; and (ii) the method of measurement of K. Drainage gives rise to dewatering and consolidation, while K measurement can cause swelling and consolidation. Swelling and consolidation affect the porosity of the peat, and can lead to significant differences in the values of K obtained. Selection of a suitable design value of K is problematical in view of the changes that can take place in K and in the peat depths as a result of drainage. In this study, three techniques were used to measure K in a blanket peat, viz. the auger hole, the piezometer and the drain-outflow methods. In some piezometric tests both recovery and falling-head procedures were used in the same hole. Values of K for undrained peat varied from 0.04 m / day to 1.34 m / day with a mean of 0.5 m / day and a coefficient of variation of 70%. However, the mean K value by the falling-head method in undrained peat was only 0.065 m / day. The falling-head (0.041 m / day), recovery (0.039 m / day) and auger-hole (0.12 m / day) methods in drained peat and the drain-outflow method (0.075 m / day) were only 9 to 27% of the mean by the auger hole and piezometer recovery methods in undrained peat. Because of consolidation and dewatering subsequent to drainage, a design value of K measured in undrained peat by the auger-hole or piezometer methods could result in an incorrect drain spacing. The variation of K in peat following on drainage can be assessed from a plot of drain outflows against water-table depth.

AB Rhododendron tomentosum Harmaja (Ledum palustre), a peat bog plant from Ericaceae family, has been used in traditional medicine as the anti-arthritis agent. Although modern researches confirm its anti-inflammatory properties, it remains threatened by habitat degradation and possibilities to collect this endangered species from its natural environment for further biological activity studies are limited. Therefore, R. tomentosum liquid in vitro cultures were established as the alternative source of that valuable plant material. Schenk-Hildebrandt medium with 24.60 mu M 2-isopentenyladenine and 592.02 mu M adenine provides intensive growth and proper morphology of the obtained microshoots. The R. tomentosum biomass was scaled up using the various bioreactors (immersion, temporary immersion and spraying systems) for better growth and improved volatile oil production. The largest biomass accumulation (fresh weight = 250 g l(-1), growth index = 280, dry weight = 20 g l(-1)) and essential oil content (0.5% v/m) were achieved with application of commercially available RITA(A (R)) bioreactor. GC/MS analysis revealed the high content of p-cymene (6.9%), alloaromadendrene (5.5%), shyobunone (8.2%) and ledene oxide (II) (13.0%) in the volatile fraction obtained from RITA(A (R)) system. The biomass growth parameters and production profile in terms of essential oil and selected terpenoid compounds were determined during the 2 month period. The influence of culture conditions and bioreactor construction on the growth and volatile oil production in R. tomentosum biomasses was discussed.

AB The western Antarctic Peninsula experienced rapid warming in the second half of the 20th century, which has increased vascular plant abundance and moss productivity. To better understand long-term ecological responses, we used paleoecological and microclimate data to investigate dynamics of late Holocene peatbank development and landscape influences. In peatbank cores from three locations on Litchfield Island (64 degrees 46'S; 64 degrees 06'W) high-resolution plant macrofossil and geochemical analysis show contrasting ecological and environmental changes. Two peatbanks on the southwest- and west-facing slopes of two separate hills are about 500 years old in contrast to a north-facing peatbank that is 2700 years old. The period from 1350 to 450 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP) at the north-facing peatbank had low accumulation (0.25 mm yr(-1), 36 g OM m(-2) yr(-1)), which we interpret as a period of low temperature and increased snow cover. Microclimate differences were amplified by this regional climate cooling, causing the delayed peat initiation on non-equator-facing slopes. Over the last 500 years, the north-facing peatbank had an accumulation rate (0.7 mm yr(-1), 76 g OM m(-2) yr(-1)) that was lower than the southwest- and west-facing peatbanks (1-1.4 mm yr(-1), 97-110 g OM m(-2) yr(-1)). Microclimate data suggest that slope aspect on Litchfield Island influences soil temperature, snow cover, and water availability that in turn affect growing-season lengths and peat accumulation. Plant macrofossils preserved in the north- and west-facing peatbanks show a centennial-scale pattern of fluctuation in relative abundance of dry-adapted Polytrichum strictum and wetter Chorisodontium aciphyllum mosses. Our results suggest that moss communities responded to external environmental influence, particularly those affecting moisture conditions, while topography and resultant microclimate differences had a strong influence on peat accumulation.

ID STACKING PATTERNS; SEQUENCES; ORIGIN
AB Accumulation of the 400 m-thick Late Permian Newcastle Coal Measures of the Sydney Basin was controlled by changes in relative sea level. Three 3rd-order sequences, which constitute the coal measures, consist of 4th-order depositional sequences of fluvial conglomerate, coal, and small paralic/lacustrine deltas/crevasse splays, deposited on a coastal plain landward of a marine shoreline. Each 4th-order sequence was deposited during a single 4th-order relative sea level cycle. Following falls in relative sea level alluvial conglomerates derived from the New England Orogen filled incised valleys above sequence boundaries forming lowstand systems tracts. Sigmoidal conglomerates with 'giant crossbeds' were deposited as alluvial fill in compactional moats formed at the toes of abandoned paralic deltas. Alluvial sediments passed through the coastal plain directly to the marine shoreline causing the shoreface to prograde. Rising relative sea level, caused siliciclastic sedimentation to wane. During these hiatuses, in the transgressive systems tract, a rising water table stimulated peat mire growth blanketing the entire non-marine area. When the vertical accumulation of peat was outpaced by increasing rates of rising relative sea level, transgressing lagoons, interdistributary bays and lakes inundated the mires above maximum flooding surfaces. Continuing relative sea level rise in the highstand systems tracts caused paralic/lacustrine crevasse splays, crevasse subdeltas, and small deltas to prograde westwards into the Newcastle half-graben from a volcanic source on the Offshore Uplift. At this time of rising base-levels sediments were trapped on the coastal plain while the marine shoreface was starved. Falling relative sea level terminated paralic/lacustrine delta progradation and initiated exposure and erosion to repeat the cycle and initiate another 4th-order sequence.
   Two source areas supplied sediment into the Newcastle half-graben. An easterly source on the Offshore Uplift shed volcanic detritus into the Newcastle Coalfield via paralic/lacustrine deltas, and the New England Orogen shed volcano-lithic detritus via braided streams. The supply from the New England Orogen was switched on or increased by a fall in relative sea level while supply from the Offshore Uplift was switched off, reduced, or diverted, and vice versa during a rise in relative sea level. Increasing rates of 2nd-order falling relative sea level resulted in an upward change from predominantly marine shoreface and coastal plain sedimentation to predominantly fluvial sedimentation in the upper Newcastle Coal Measures.

DE CLASTIC SWAMP; PEAT SWAMP; INSITU TREES; COMPACTION; SUBSIDENCE
AB In a localized and well-exposed study area, we have examined the depositional record of stacked peat and alluvial swamp facies in the Mary Lee coal zone, Lower Pennsylvanian "Pottsville" Formation, Warrior basin, Alabama, USA.  We propose an integrated model to account for this cyclicity.
   The Jagger, Blue Creek, Mary Lee, and Newcastle coals represent peat swamp environments.  Erect forests are preserved immediately above each coal.  Standing, in situ trees are rooted in the coal, supported and casted by mudstone.  Within the first 0.2 m of mudstone autochthonous accumulations represent the last vegetational elements of peat-accumulating swamps.  These mark the senescence and death of the peat swamp after high-magnitude floods.  Although these swamps no longer accumulated peat, reforestation occurred, albeit in clastic-dominated swamp environments.
   Clastic swamps are represented by fossiliferous mudstones between coals.  These facies contain erect, in situ lycophyte and calamite trunks, stacked forest-floor litter horizons (identified by lycophyte and pteridosperm-dominated litter accumulations and mud-cast logs), and paleosols (identified by stigmarian, other "rooting" structures, and rhizoconcretion horizons).  These facies are capped by a coal, marking the resumption of isolation from clastic and renewed peat accumulation.
   Probable regulatory mechanisms for the alternation of peat and clastic swamp facies, and the stacking of clastic swamp facies, involve fluctuating clastic depocenters due to subsidence and/or compaction on two scales.  Subsidence on a local scale, over a relatively short time span, is believed to be due to differential compaction of buried peat.  After initial peat burial, a local depositional low would form.  With increasing clastic deposition and loading, peat compaction would continue.  This subsidence is recorded by stacked forest-floor litter horizons above the peat.  When enough clastic sediment had accumulated, subsidence either stopped, or slowed to allow the resumption of peat accumulation, and isolation from clastic deposition.  Tectonic subsidence may have occurred over a longer period of time.  These changes resulted in fluctuations in paleo-shoreline and the development of marginal marine sequences between coal zones.

AB Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increased between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, around 21,000 years ago) and the preindustrial era(1). It is thought that the evolution of this atmospheric carbon dioxide (and that of atmospheric methane) during the glacial-to-interglacial transition was influenced by organic carbon that was stored in permafrost during the LGM and then underwent decomposition and release following thaw(2,3). It has also been suggested that the rather erratic atmospheric delta C-13 and Delta C-14 signals seen during deglaciation(1.4) could partly be explained by the presence of a large terrestrial inert LGM carbon stock, despite the biosphere being less productive (and therefore storing less carbon)(5,6). Here we present an empirically derived estimate of the carbon stored in permafrost during the LGM by reconstructing the extent and carbon content of LGM biomes, peatland regions and deep sedimentary deposits. We find that the total estimated soil carbon stock for the LGM northern permafrost region is smaller than the estimated present-day storage (in both permafrost and non-permafrost soils) for the same region. A substantial decrease in the permafrost area from the LGM to the present day has been accompanied by a roughly 400-petagram increase in the total soil carbon stock. This increase in soil carbon suggests that permafrost carbon has made no net contribution to the atmospheric carbon pool since the LGM. However, our results also indicate potential postglacial reductions in the portion of the carbon stock that is trapped in permafrost, of around 1,000 petagrams, supporting earlier studies(7). We further find that carbon has shifted from being primarily stored in permafrost mineral soils and loess deposits during the LGM, to being roughly equally divided between peatlands, mineral soils and permafrost loess deposits today.

AB Free and associated bitumens were isolated by sequential extraction from Vlasina lake peat (SE Serbia) and were investigated in order to differentiate between oil pollution and natural bitumens. Four peat samples were collected at different depths, on a peat island. Gas chromatographic (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis revealed the presence of three markedly different bitumen fractions. Here we show that the free bitumens are representing the native peat bitumens. The two associated bitumens are mainly the products of bacterial rework of organic substance, which were then trapped by two differing mechanisms. The bitumens characteristics and association features exclude a contribution of oil pollution.

TI Infiltration, runoff and sediment production in blanket peat catchments:
   implications of field rainfall simulation experiments
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES

   saturation-excess overland flow
ID EROSION; HYDROLOGY; DELIVERY; WATER; CLIMATE; FLOW
AB Blanket peat covers the headwaters of many major European rivers. Runoff production in upland blanket peat catchments is flashy with large flood peaks and short lag times; there is minimal baseflow. Little is known about the exact processes of infiltration and runoff generation within these upland headwaters. This paper presents results from a set of rainfall simulation experiments performed on the blanket peat moorland of the North Pennines, UK. Rainfall was simulated at low intensities (3-12 mm h(-1)), typical of natural rainfall, on bare and vegetated peat surfaces. Runoff response shows that infiltration rate increases with rainfall intensity; the use of low-intensity rainfall therefore allows a more realistic evaluation of infiltration rates and flow processes than previous studies. Overland flow is shown to be common on both vegetated and bare peat surfaces although surface cover does exert some control. Most runoff is produced within the top few centimetres of the peat and runoff response decreases rapidly with depth. Little vertical percolation takes place to depths greater than 10 cm owing to the saturation of the peat mass. This study provides evidence that the quickflow response of upland blanket peat catchments is a result of saturation-excess overland flow generation. Rainfall-runoff response from small plots varies with season. Following warm, dry weather, rainfall tends to infiltrate more readily into blanket peat, not just initially but to the extent that steady-state surface runoff rates are reduced and more flow takes place within the peat, albeit at shallow depth. Sediment erosion from bare peat plots tends to be supply limited. Seasonal weather conditions may affect this in that after a warm, dry spell, surface desiccation allows sediment erosion to become transport limited. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

ID SNUGGEDY SWAMP; SOUTH-CAROLINA; BACK-BARRIER; ENVIRONMENT
AB Three Carboniferous age coals from southern West Virginia, U.S.A., were examined at bench level and compared to a Holocene peat deposit, the Snuggedy Swamp, South Carolina, U.S.A. Data for all deposits consisted of coal or peat thickness, ash content and petrographic composition as well as parting or overlying clastic sediment thickness. Comparison of coal and parting thickness showed an inverse relationship in all cases. Bimodal distribution patterns for coal/peat thickness versus area indicate that the transition between areas of extensive, thick coal/peat and extensive, thin coal/peat was rapid.
   In the coal deposits at bench level, both ash and organic inert content increased toward the transition to thin coal. The areas of thick coal contained the highest vitrinite/reactive contents and lowest ash values volumetrically. This is similar to the distribution of low-ash, well-preserved, thick peat occurring in the central, raised areas of the Snuggedy Swamp, surrounded by areas of high-ash, decomposed peat subject to flooding. Although the depositional environments interpreted for each of the three coal beds and the Snuggedy peat deposit differ widely, the deposits themselves show similar distribution trends in thickness, ash content and petrographic composition.

AB Concentrations of O-2 and CO2 in 11 mineral and peat forest soils were related to physical, chemical and biological site variables by means of PLS modelling. Soil depth, volumetric water content, air-filled porosity, soil temperature and soil respiration explained 66% of the spatial variation in gas concentrations, when all soils and depths were included. With the inclusion of complementary X variables, the model explained 76% of the Y variance. The X variables affecting gas transport in the soil explained more of both spatial and temporal gas variations than those affecting the biological activity. Much of the effect of water content originated in the early growing season and were conditioned by frozen soil layers, hampering the infiltration of water from snowmelt. Soil moisture, rather than temperature, thus regulates the apparent soil atmosphere variations in these forest soils of northern Sweden, where a temperate climate with cold and snowy winters and moist summer conditions prevails.

AB Denitrification plays an important role in N-cycling. However, information on the rates of denitrification from horticultural growing media is rare in literature. In this study, the effects of pH, N, C, and moisture contents on denitrification were investigated using four moderately decomposed peat types (oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and transitional). Basal and potential denitrification rates (20A degrees C, 18 h) from the unlimed peat samples varied widely from 2.0 to 21.8 and from 118.9 to 306.6 mu g (N2O + N-2)-N L-1 dry peat h(-1), respectively, with the highest rates from the eutrophic peat and the lowest from the transitional one. Both basal and potential denitrification rates were substantially increased by 3.6-14- and 1.4-2.3-fold, respectively, when the initial pH (4.3-4.8) was raised to 5.9-6.5 units. Emissions of (N2O + N-2)-N from oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and transitional peats were markedly increased by the addition of 0.15 g NO3-N L-1 dry peat but further additions had no effect. Denitrification rates were increased by increasing glucose concentration suggesting that the activity of denitrifiers in all peat types was limited by the low availability of easily decomposable C source. Increasing moisture contents of all peats from 40 to 50% water-filled pore space (WFPS) did not significantly (p > 0.05) increase (N2O + N-2)-N emissions. However, a positive effect was observed when the moisture contents were increased from 60% to 70% WFPS in the eutrophic peat, from 70% to 80% in the transitional, from 80% to 90% in the oligotrophic and from 70% to 90% in the mesotrophic peat. It can be concluded that liming, N-fertilization, availability of easily decomposable C, and moist condition above 60% WFPS could encourage denitrification from peats although the rates are greatly influenced by the peat-forming environments (eutrophic > mesotrophic > oligotrophic > transitional types).

AB Samples of two moss species, Sphagnum and Polytrichum, were collected at 19 points selected along vertical transects in the Karkonosze Nits. (739-1393 m) and the Izerskie Mts. (500-1100 m), SW Poland. Continuous automatic monitoring of temperature and humidity at the sampling points was carried out (I h intervals) through the entire growth season (2004). A strong correlation between delta C-13 value of plant tissue cellulose and mean air temperature was noted for both areas and sampling periods (R-2 between 0.92 and 0.64). It was calculated that a 1 degrees C increase in air temperature during the growing season results in a -1.6 parts per thousand. (Sphagnum) and a -1.5 parts per thousand. (Polytrichum) decrease in delta C-13. In contrast, it seems that humidity shows no clear influence on the carbon isotope composition of mosses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of different isolates of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi to enhance the growth of Pinus sylvestris seedlings in five natural peat substrates with different nitrogen concentrations, and the effect of the Scots pine seedlings and fungal inoculum on the formation of dissolved inorganic and organic nitrogen in peat. Utilization of different organic nitrogen compounds by microbial community in the peat was also investigated using Biolog MT MicroPlates. Inoculation of the seedlings with EM fungi enhanced seedling growth. Piloderma croceum increased root growth especially, whereas Lactarius rufus increased needle growth and Suillus variegatus I, II and III improved both root and needle growth. All the EM fungi also significantly affected stem growth. Nitrogen concentration of the peat did not affect seedling growth as much as the EM fungi. At the lowest peat N concentration (1.17%) NH4+ mineralisation was lower and DON (dissolved organic nitrogen) accumulation higher than at higher peat N concentrations. The EM fungal isolates had different effects on NH4+ and DON accumulation/degradation in peat. The EM fungal isolates significantly increased NH4+ formation in the peat, whereas L. rufus and P croceum had an opposite effect on DON accumulation. S. variegatus I significantly decreased the DON concentrations during peat incubation. The N concentration of the peat slightly affected the utilization of amino acids and polyamines by the microbial community, whereas inoculation with S. variegatus 1, 11 or III had no effect.

AB We estimated the effect of invading Sasa vegetation and accelerated terrestrialization on the microbial community structure in Sarobetsu-genya wetland (SGW) and Nakanominedaira wetland (NW) (original vegetation, Sphagnum). All examined peat-pore water samples were acidic. Electrical conductivity significantly differed between SGW and NW. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and analysis of similarity based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) band patterns revealed differences in the bacterial community structure between the Sasa and Sphagnum vegetations at a depth of 10 cm in NW. In contrast, the bacterial NMDS profiles at all depths differed between the 2 wetlands rather than between the 2 vegetations. The archaeal community structure significantly differed between the wetlands at depths of 30 and 50 cm. The bacterial diversity index derived from the DGGE profiles significantly differed between the wetlands at all depths. The archaeal diversity index significantly differed between the wetlands at a depth of 50 cm. Sasa invasion affected the microbial community structure in the rhizosphere, up to a depth of 10 cm; this effect differed with the terrestrialization speed. These results suggest that in peat bogs subjected to artificially accelerated terrestrialization, the microbial community changes before the occurrence of the natural hydrarch ecological succession involving ground vegetation.

AB The influence of freezing on Sphagnum highly decomposed peats was estimated from their physical properties and their wettability measured in relation to the degree of desiccation. The results showed that the physical properties of peats were drastically affected by freezing, particularly improving their water availability and resulting in less, and more reversible, shrinkage after air-drying. However, contact angles measured for frozen or unfrozen peats are very similar. These results seem to indicate that the changes in physical properties are only due to a change in peat structure during freezing and are not a consequence of a change in water affinity. Nevertheless, even if freezing does not affect the wettability of materials, its influence on peat structure contributes to an improvement in their hydric properties.

AB With a growing interest in the diversification (e. g., bioenergy, biochemicals) of the forest industry beyond the traditional product streams, concerns that higher harvest utilization levels may compromise site productivity have been heightened. This study reports on 15-year tree growth responses to varying levels of biomass removals conducted on four soil types: loamy tills, outwash sands, wet mineral, and peatlands. Experimental harvest treatments included stem-only, full-tree, full-tree chipping (a full-tree harvest with the roadside material chipped and returned to the site), and full-tree + bladed (a full-tree harvest followed by forest floor removal). Results indicated no significant effect on height growth on the loamy tills, a significant decline for the blading treatment on the sandy soils, and an increase when the blading treatment was applied to the peatland sites. At the stand level, better planted seedling survival and higher recruitment of naturals on the more extreme removal treatment (forest floor removal on sandy sites) tended to nullify any negative impacts identified in the individual-tree growth measurements. The more than doubling of the slash loading on the stem-only treatment plots compared with the full-tree plots did not result in differences in tree productivity levels between these two operational treatments. The stands, however, were just approaching crown closure by year 15, suggesting that ongoing monitoring will be required to confirm that the growth trajectories for the various harvest treatment - soil type combinations can be maintained.

AB The dynamics of the carbon dioxide emissions from the surface of a gleyic iron-illuvial sandy peat podzolic soil under a mature bilberry-sphagnum pine forest were studied during the growing seasons of 2008-2010. The maximum rates of the CO2 emission were observed in late July-early August, and the minimum rates were in October. In the hot summer of 2010, an additional maximum was observed in June. A close positive correlation existed between the intensity of the CO2 emission and the soil temperature (r = 0.71, alpha = 0.05), whereas no significant correlation was found between the CO2 emission and the soil water content. The coefficient of multiple correlation between the rate of the CO2 emission and the hydrothermic soil characteristics reached 0.57 (at alpha = 0.05). The total CO2 emission from the soil surface during the growing season was estimated at 68-100 g of C m(-2).

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is an important index of soil quality because of its relationship with crop yield. The application of organic matter to soil is a significant method for increasing SOM. Different organic materials have varying effects in increasing SOM. This study investigates the effects of combining different sources of organic matter (i.e., compost, leguminous green manure, and peat) with a chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer on the growth and N accumulation in corn and rice plants. This study examines seven treatments, including a no-fertilization check and a conventional chemical fertilizer treatment. Shoots of corn and rice were sampled at the tasseling (panicle initiation for rice) and maturity stages. The biomass yield was measured and the total N was analyzed. At the maturity stage, the soil samples were collected to determine the chemical properties. The results showed that a small percentage of the N in the compost and peat, after their application, was available to the crop during the growth season; the production of biomass and N absorption among rice and corn plants was minimal compared to that treated with chemical N fertilizer. The application of compost and peat resulted in SOM accumulation, particularly with peat. However, the application of compost combined with chemical fertilizer not only produced sufficient nutrients for crop growth but also resulted in an accumulation of SOM, which is vital for enhancing the soil quality. Most of the N in green manure (GM) was mineralized shortly after application, causing excessive growth of rice and corn plants during the early stage, but reducing their reproductive growth and grain yield.

AB Lochnagar is a remote mountain lake to the south-east of the Cairngorm region in Scotland. Its catchment receives anthropogenic trace metals solely from atmospheric deposition. Ten peat cores were taken from the catchment and analysis confirmed that they have been contaminated by trace metals. The peats have an high affinity for trace metals and this results in metal accumulation in the surface peat layers. The formation of trace metal sulphides may also reduce remobilisation. In this way, trace metals derived from atmospheric deposition have been scavenged and accumulated. In contaminated peat layers, 77.4% Hg, 89.6% Pb, 93.4% Cu, 72.4% Zn and 86.5% Cd of the total stored are from anthropogenic sources. The accumulated trace metals in the peats can potentially influence the lake system through erosion. Spheroidal carbonaceous particle (SCP) profiles were used to date the peat cores. By referring to the SCP profiles in the peats and comparing these with the trace metal profiles in the lake sediments, the mobility of trace metals in the catchment peats is confirmed.

AB The Zillingdorf deposit formed during the late Miocene filling of Lake Pannon and contains Austria's largest lignite reserves. Two lignite seams are present and developed within frequently flooded, low-lying mires in near shore environments. High sulphur contents are due to the influence of the brackish water body of Lake Pannon. During peat accumulation a transgression forced the NW-SE trending shoreline northeastwards. Differences in soluble organic matter (SOM) yield and hydrocarbon content of borehole samples and woody macrofossils are related to differences in the content and composition of free lipids of microbial origin and/or hydrocarbons derived from the biogeochemical degradation of plant tissue. Variations of pristane/phytane ratios are interpreted to reflect differences in the redox conditions of the mire. Peatification in an acidic and aerobic environment is further reflected by the predominance of aromatic over saturated hydrocarbons, the presence of an intense complex mixture in the GC traces due to biodegradation processes, high ratios for diasterenes relative to sterenes, and high concentration ratios of hopanes to hop-17(21)-ene of the respective samples. Gelification of plant tissue is governed by microbial activity, as indicated by the positive relationship between gelification index and hopanoids concentration. The composition of terpenoid biomarkers indicates the predominance of gymnosperms over angiosperms and increasing proportions of angiosperms in the peat-forming vegetation with decreasing depth in the upper scam. From the sesqui- and diterpenoids present in the lignite and fossil wood remnants, a predominant role of species of the Coniferales families Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae are concluded. The preservation of plant tissue is governed by the presence/absence of decay-resistant gymnosperms. A general influence of the floral assemblage on the isotopic composition of organic carbon of the lignite (delta C-13=-27.2 to -24.6 parts per thousand) is proposed. Decomposition of plant tissue and biogeochemical carbon cycling is assumed to further affect the delta C-13 values of the lignite. Carbon isotope data of fossil wood remnants are consistent with their chemotaxonomical classification as gymnosperms (delta C-13 between -22.5 parts per thousand and -24.9 parts per thousand) and angiosperms (delta C-13 between -25.5 parts per thousand and -26.6 parts per thousand), respectively. The delta C-13 data of the extracted cellulose reveal clear differences between fossil wood from gymnosperms (average delta C-13=-20.3 parts per thousand) and angiosperms (mean delta C-13=-22.9 parts per thousand). The higher isotopic difference of about 3.5 parts per thousand between cellulose and fossil wood, compared to that found in modern trees, is explained by the smaller effect of C-13 discrimination for cellulose when compared with wood during decomposition.

AB Sapric peat is extremely soft, unconsolidated and has high organic content. It is most decomposed peat with less fiber content among all peats. This paper investigates the effectiveness of using different ratios of cement-sodium silicate system grout compounds with kaolinite in mechanical property (shear strength) and micro-structural properties (SEM and EDX) of sapric peat samples after 3 and 30 days of curing. The study showed that the kaolinite was effective in increasing the shear strength and reducing the moisture content of the treated peat. Calcium chloride seemed to have different effects on the grouts strength. It caused to increased shear strength of samples until the net charge of the sample changed to zero and then it decreased with further increase in calcium chloride. By increasing sodium silicate (within 3%), cement and soaking time on treated peat, it was observed that they are able to increase the shear strength and density with a corresponding decrease in moisture content, porous microstructure, and the multitude of voids of confection.

AB Monitoring of air pollutants is an important instrument to detect threats and to observe temporal trends of emissions. Determining the spatial distribution of oxidized and reduced N species via modelling requires sufficient knowledge about innumerous small sources from traffic, settlements and agriculture. Empirical studies are required to validate the model data but measurements of the total N deposition (e.g. micrometeorological measurements) are very expensive.
   Against this background, the TONIS, a new suitable technique which combines a biomonitoring with plants and technical measurements was developed. During 6 exposures between 2012 and 2016 at different polluted sites in Northwest Germany, TONIS accumulated between 17 and 25 kg N ha-1 yr(-1)t. The results are feasible compared to simultaneously measured NH3 and NO2 concentration and bulk N deposition. At one site within a peat bog the accumulated N in TONIS was found to be in the range of total N deposition derived from a micrometeorological approach. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although most studies find temperature, soil moisture and water table to be important environmental factors that affect peatland carbon dynamics, the role of vegetation communities has been investigated less. Therefore, this study investigates whether peatland ecosystems produce heterogeneous CO2 fluxes due to differences in vegetation community. In addition, the study also examines which major environmental factors influence this vegetation. To achieve the aims of this study, four sites with different vegetation communities were established in a semi-natural peatland ecosystem in Poland. CO2 flux measurements were carried out using a closed dynamic chamber system. Measurement campaigns were carried out from April until December 2008, every 2-3 weeks. Measured ecosystem respiration (Reco) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) rates showed daily and seasonal variation at all investigated sites. Reco presented a strong dependence on soil temperature at the 5 cm depth, while NEE showed a strong dependence on solar radiation. The mean temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) for the four sites ranged between 3.17 and 8.3. The highest NEE and Reco values were obtained at the site represented by Caricetum elatae and the lowest NEE and Reco at the site represented by Calamagrostietum neglectae.

AB The main objective of the study was to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental changes recorded in lake and peatland sediments from the peatland located in the western part of Lublin Polesie, where no former palaeoecological research had been conducted, and to compare findings to changes reconstructed for other sites in the eastern part of this region. Climate changes were considered, as well as the effects of human impact, which intensified particularly after the Middle Ages. In recent times the trajectory of change of the Mytycze ecosystem was exceptional because in the 1960s this area was included in the Wieprz-Krzna Canal System, and then renaturated after the discontinued use of hydraulic engineering structures. This is the largest canal in Poland and runs in the immediate vicinity of the watershed supplied by two large rivers: the Bug and the Wieprz. The presented study mainly relied on the following proxies: pollen, testate amoebae and other non-pollen palynomorphs, and peat decomposition. Data from the Archaeological Picture of Poland (AZP) allowed for a detailed reconstruction of chronological changes in the palaeoenvironment. An important aspect of this study was also the first ever use of testate amoebae remains in the reconstruction of the Lublin Polesie environment. Findings from research on the Mytycze site for the first time confirmed that the beginning of the formation of the lake basin was similar to that reconstructed for all other lakes in the Lublin Polesie region investigated previously with multidisciplinary methods, and dates to the end of the late glacial of the Vistulian. The early phase of the peatland formation resulting from the shallowing of the lake was very long and lasted from the Subboreal period to the 15th century. The youngest phases with records of human impact are characterised by increased human pressure (intensified cultivation of cereals, buckwheat, legumes and brassica crops) after the Wieprz-Krzna Canal System was put into use, and intensified grazing in the vicinity of Lake Mytycze. This phase, dated to the 1970s, is followed by a marked increase in the water level, which was probably related to the supply of water to the dammed Lake Mytycze from Wieprz-Krzna Canal via Lake Drat?ow. Records in the upper part of the core indicate the return of Sphagnum spp., most likely due to the cessation of the use of hydraulic engineering structures and the renaturation of the lake and peatland ecosystem, which led to the appearance of valuable species of plants and birds.

TI Anomalous gold contents in brown coals and peat in the south-eastern
   region of the Western-Siberian platform
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY

DT Article

AB One hundred twenty-two samples of Jurassic and Paleogene brown coals and 1254 peat samples from the south-eastern region of the Western-Siberian platform were analyzed for gold by the neutron-activation method. Mean content of Au in Jurassic coals is 30 +/- 8 ppb, in Paleogene coals is 10.6 +/- 4.8 ppb, and in peat is 6 +/- 1.4 ppb. Concentrations of gold as high as 4.4 ppm were found in coal ash and 0.48 ppm in the peat ash. Coal beds with anomalous gold contents were found at Western-Siberian platform for the first time.
   Negative correlation between gold and ash yield in coals and peat and highest gold concentrations were found in low-ash and ultra-low-ash coals and peat. Primarily this is due to gold's association with organic matter.
   For the investigation of mode of occurrence of An in peat the bitumen, water-soluble and high-hydrolyzed substances, humic acids, cellulose and lignin were extracted from it. It was determined that in peat about 95% of gold is combined with organic matter. Forty to sixty percent of Au is contained in humic acids and the same content is in lignin. Bitumens, water-soluble and high-hydrolyzed substances contain no more than 1% of general gold quantity in peat.
   The conditions of accumulation of high gold concentrations were considered. The authors suggest that Au accumulation in peat and brown coals and the connection between anomalous gold concentrations and organic matter in low-ash coals and peat can explain a biogenic sorption mechanism of Au accumulation. The sources of formation of Au high concentration were various Au-Sb, Au-Ag Au-As-Sb deposits that are abundant in the Southern and South-Eastern peripheries of the coal basin. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Climate protection through rewetting of fen foils: welfare effects shown
   on the example of the Eider-Treene region in Schleswig-Holstein
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
ID ORGANIC SOILS; EMISSIONS; GERMANY
AB By raising the groundwater level of fen soils large amounts of greenhouse gases can be saved at low cost. The Eider-Treene lowland in Schleswig-Holstein served as an example for two scenarios of raising groundwater levels (by 10 and 20 cm). The cost for raising the groundwater level by 10 cm amounted to (sic)12/t co2-eq/year on average, and for raising levels by 20 cm it amounted to (sic)17/t co2eq/year on average. For agricultural undertakings this means costs in the order of (sic)112 and (sic)359 respectively per hectare and year, and in terms of capitalization this corresponds to a reduced present value (losses in land value) amounting to (sic)2240 and (sic)7018 per hectare. In the areas considered for rewetting; dairy farming would be particularly affected by any such measure.
   In this study the calculated costs correspond to the losses in the contribution margin, therefore a wide variability in individual costs shows, depending on the milk price paid. From possible compensation payments by the State to farmers it would be mainly larger dairy farms and beef farmers who benefit. Here, this leads to contribution margin gains amounting to up to (sic)300/hectare and year, i.e. increases in land present value amounting to up to (sic)6000/ha. Smaller farms would be under increased cost pressure due to this type of climate protection measure (losses in the contribution margin of up to (sic)220/hectare and year, i.e. losses in land present value amounting to up to (sic)4440/ha); structural change in this region would thus accelerate further. In the long-term considerable investments in the maintenance and expansion of drainage pumping stations could be saved. In comparison with other climate protection measures, raising the groundwater level of fen areas is an inexpensive way to save considerable amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of a dynamic management of groundwater, i.e. high groundwater levels in winter, and water levels of approx. 30 cm under groundwater level during the growing season, would moreover allow for the continuation of moderate dairy farming activities in lowland regions.

AB We critically review recent literature on carbon storage and fluxes within natural and constructed freshwater wetlands, and specifically address concerns of readers working in applied science and engineering. Our purpose is to review and assess the distribution and conversion of carbon in the water environment, particularly within wetland systems. A key aim is to assess if wetlands are carbon sinks or sources. Carbon sequestration and fluxes in natural and constructed wetlands located around the world has been assessed. All facets of carbon (solid and gaseous forms) have been covered. We draw conclusions based on these studies. Findings indicate that wetlands can be both sources and sinks of carbon, depending on their age, operation, and the environmental boundary conditions such as location and climate. Suggestions for further research needs in the area of carbon storage in wetland sediments are outlined to facilitate the understanding of the processes of carbon storage and removal and also the factors that influence them.

AB Siliceous microfossils (diatom valves, chrysophyte stomatocysts, and testate amoebae plates) were examined from a 2.6-m thick peat deposit from Nordvest phi, northwestern Greenland (76 degrees 44'N, 73 degrees 13'W). The moss, predominantly Aplodon worm-skioldii (Hornem.) R.Br., began to accumulate approximately 6500 years ago and persisted for about 2000 years. Siliceous microfossils were generally well preserved in the peat, although taxon richness was low (i.e., only 19 diatom taxa, 16 chrysophyte cyst morphotypes, and 4 testate amoebae general. Despite the paucity of taxa, marked shifts in species composition were recorded. Geochemical analyses and biogenic silica determination on the peat did not show any significant trends. To our knowledge, this study represents the first such combined analysis of a High Arctic peat, so our interpretations should be considered tentative. Environmental variables were not stable during the 2000 years of peat accumulation, as suggested by microfossil assemblage changes. For example, about 5000 years BP, diatoms reached their maximum relative abundance with taxa indicative of wetter habitats. We hypothesize that an influx of meltwater to the peat may have occurred at this time, perhaps because of wetter conditions or larger accumulations of snow during winter. These preliminary data indicate that siliceous microfossil analyses from arctic peat cores may eventually fine-tune paleoecological inferences for this climatically important region, once the environmental variables determining species distributions in peat deposits are determined.

AB . An integrated multidisciplinary approach including descriptive and experimental research of environmental and biotic factors was used to evaluate an attempt to restore a species-rich fen meadow, phytosociologically belonging to the Cirsio-Molinietum. Expert judgement and preliminary research indicated that soil acidification, due to drainage in the surrounding area, caused the degeneration of the fen meadow. Flooding the meadow with surface water was applied in order to stop acidification. A small irrigated wetland (helophyte filter) was constructed to reduce nutrient availability in the surface water. Sod cutting was applied in a small area as well. The two measures were evaluated through: (1) measurements of hydrological and soil factors, (2) seed bank analysis, (3) recording species composition in permanent plots, (4) assessing the type and extent of nutrient limitation using a full-factorial fertilization experiment, (5) assessing the effect of liming on vegetation biomass, and (6) recording the growth of three introduced fen meadow species in the liming experiment. The research was carried out in a degraded site with intact vegetation, a degraded site where the top soil was removed by sod cutting and a reference site with intact Cirsio-Molinietum vegetation. Groundwater levels in the degraded and the stripped site differed slightly from those of the reference site but they were within the range of Cirsio-Molinietum requirements. Groundwater quality slightly improved in the stripped site. Top-soil removal considerably reduced the macro-nutrient contents and caused a stronger P-deficiency. No increase in soil pH was observed immediately after top-soil removal. A small increase in soil pH was found after five years in the stripped site, indicating a slight recovery from acidification. Liming after top-soil removal had little effect on the soil pH after six months but stimulated the growth of established species such as Agrostis canina. Few viable seeds of characteristic fen meadow species were present in the seed banks of both degraded and well developed fen meadow sites. The species composition after top soil removal reflected the seed bank of the degraded fen meadow and establishment of characteristic fen meadow species was poor, even after five years. The introduced species (Carex hostiana, C. panicea, Cirsium dissectum) survived during the first year in both the degraded and the stripped site. Liming initially stimulated the growth of two species, but in the second year this effect disappeared. After two years, none of the introduced species survived at the stripped site. The restoration measures failed so far, probably because acidification could not be counteracted satisfactorily. Finally, it was concluded that our multidisciplinary approach enables us to draw proper conclusions and that it is suitable for other restoration attempts as well.

AB P-31-NMR has been used to characterise the major forms of organic and inorganic phosphorus in soil derived alkali extracts and humic acids. Blanket peat, which had been under different fertilisation treatments for 10 years was compared with an agricultural mineral soil. In the mineral soil the phosphorus was shown to be in the form of inorganic orthophosphate and phosphate monoesters whereas the peat soil also contained phosphate diesters and other inorganic forms of phosphorus. Changes in various phosphorus pools in the peat soils were shown to correlate with differences in fertilisation regime and land management practice. Fertilisation with superphosphate increased phosphate monoester content in the peat, although vegetation type appeared to have greater impact on the phosphate monoester concentration. The degree of microbial activity, as indicated by the presence of polyphosphates and absence of phosphonates, correlated positively with vegetational improvement and fertilisation of the peat soils.

AB Boreal wetland carbon cycling is vulnerable to climate change in part because hydrology and the extent of frozen ground have strong influences on plant and microbial functions. We examined the response of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) across an experimental manipulation of water table position (both raised and lowered water table treatments) in a boreal-rich fen in interior Alaska. DOC and TDN responses to water table manipulation exhibited an interaction with seasonal ice dynamics. We observed consistently higher DOC and TDN concentrations in the lowered water table treatment (71.7 +/- 6.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.3 mg(-L)) than in both the control (55.6 +/- 5.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 mg(-L)) and raised (49.1 +/- 4.3 and 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg L-1, respectively) water table treatments. Across all plots, pore water DOC concentrations at 20 cm increased as the depth to water table increased (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.001). DOC concentrations also increased as the seasonal thaw depth increased, with solutes increasing most rapidly in the drained plot (R-2 = 0.62, p < 0.001). About half of the TDN pool was composed of dissolved organic N (DON). Inorganic N and DON were both highly correlated with changes in DOC, and their respective constraints to mineralization are discussed. These results demonstrate that a declining water table position and dryer conditions affect thaw depth and peat temperatures, and interactions among these ecosystem properties will likely increase DOC and TDN loading and potential for export in these systems.

AB The results are given of comparative analysis of the content and transformation of Sr-90 and Cs-137 over a peat deposit of swamps. During radioecological study, account was taken of the quantitative composition and physicochemical properties of the peat, as well as of the specific nature of the entry of radioactive products to peat deposits. Considering the increased capacity of peat for accumulating radionuclides and the specific features of sorption processes in a peat deposit, it is expedient to utilize swamps as a convenient natural object for continuous monitoring of radioactive contamination of the environment.

AB Based on the radiocarbon data of the moss peat banks in Fildes Peninsula, Antarctica, it was calculated that the mean rates of peat accumulation in the upper layer and the lower layer are 0.195 and 0.069 4 mm . a(-1) respectively. Based on the radiocarbon date (3 265 +/- 120 aBP) and the mean rate of peat accumulation in the lower peat layer, it was calculated that the age of the coast terrace on which the moss peat bank occurs is earlier than 4 300 aBP. During the past 4 300 years the coast terrace has risen about 18 m without apparently being destroyed, and the age of the glacier retreating process in this area is also earlier than 4 300 aBP.

AB Bioavailability of lipophilic chemicals is influenced by the physicochemical properties of soils/sediment such as particle size, pH, clay, and organic carbon content. The present study investigated the effects of sediment composition and aging on the oral bioavailability of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in rats. Formulated sediments were prepared using various ratios of kaolinite and montmorillonite clay, sand, peat moss, and black carbon, spiked with C-14-HCB, and orally administered to rats prior to and after one year of aging in dark at 10 degrees C. In the nonaged sediments there was a 21 to 45% reduction in the oral bioavailability of HCB when compared to the corn oil standard without any clear pattern of the impact of the sediment clay and/or organic carbon content. One year of aging resulted in statistically significant (p = 0.049) reduction in the oral bioavailability of HCB from the sediments compared to the corn oil standard and nonaged sediment indicating stronger interactions between HCB and sediment contents with aging. The mean reduction in oral bioavailability after one year of aging ranged from approximately 5 to 14% greater than that observed for nonaged sediments. The fecal elimination of the HCB-derived radioactivity from the one-year-aged sediments was much higher than the nonaged sediments, consistent with the lower absorption from the gastrointestinal tract due to lower desorption of HCB from the aged sediments. Increase in the fecal elimination and decrease in oral bioavailability of C-14-HCB was related to the increase in clay and black carbon.

AB Advanced knowledge of the mechanisms and kinetic parameters controlling the thermal decomposition of peat is of importance for understanding smouldering peat fires and quantify fire risk. Smouldering fires do not have the visual impact of the flaming front but constitute an important wildfire phenomenon because of the associated large carbon emissions and damage to a valuable ecosystem. Moreover, in case of extreme dry conditions or strong winds, smouldering fires develop easily into scrub or forest flaming fire. In this context, a thermal study on three different types of peat has been conducted: two high-moor peat types collected in Edinburgh (Scotland) and in Tomsk (Siberia), and one transition peat from Tomsk. The botanical composition, degree of decomposition and ultimate analysis were determined for the different samples and compared. These parameters were correlated to thermal behaviour obtained by Thermogravimetry experiments. Significantly different degradation behaviour is observed for the different peat types. A kinetic method to predict the temperature of the sample at high heating rates is applied. Comparison shows a good correlation between experimental and numerical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Changes in climate could have far-reaching consequences for ecosystems sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation, such as boreal permafrost peatlands and grassland/woodland boundaries. The Long-term data from our studies in these ecosystems suggest that transient responses of permafrost and vegetation to climate change may be difficult to predict due to lags and positive feedbacks related to vegetation and disturbance. Boreal permafrost peatlands comprise an ecosystem with strong local controls on microclimate that influence the formation and thaw of permafrost. These local controls may preserve permafrost during! the transient stages of climate warming, producing lagged responses. The prairie-forest border region of the northern Great Plains has experienced frequent change and has complex dynamics involving transitions in the grassland composition of prairie and in the degree of woodiness in bordering forests. Fire frequency interacts with fuel loading and tree recruitment in ways that affect the tinting and direction of change. Lags and thresholds could lead to sudden large responses to future climate change that are not readily apparent from current vegetation. The creation of adequate models to characterize transient ecosystem changes will require an understanding of the linkages among processes operating at the scale of 10s of meters and over long time periods.

AB Measurements, made at a high subarctic, maritime, wetland tundra site, are presented for three different growing seasons. These are divided into hot-dry, normal-dry and normal-wet years and the behaviour of their surface energy and water balances is examined within the framework of a combination model. For periods of comparable energy availability, evapotranspiration during hot-dry conditions can be larger than during cooler and wetter periods. This results from small stomatal resistance in the sparse canopy of well-rooted sedges, and from the ability of peat soils to supply water under conditions of large atmospheric demand. This demand is expressed in terms of the vapour pressure deficit and it counteracts the large surface resistances which develop during dry periods. In many respects, the energy balance of a subarctic wetland tundra is comparable to observations and models for temperate agricultural and forest lands, in spite of the fact that the soils are organic, the vegetation canopy is sparse and there is continuous permafrost. A dry year promotes deeper thaw depths in the permafrost soils, during the growing season, than does a wet one. This is due to larger ground heat fluxes and larger soil thermal diffusivities. We concluded that maritime, wetland tundra, growing on peat soils, displays feedback mechanisms, which can offset the effects of moisture stress, caused by summer climate warming of a similar magnitude to that simulated by General Circulation Models for a 2 X CO2 scenario.

AB Drained thermokarst lake basins accumulate significant amounts of soil organic carbon in the form of peat, which is of interest to understanding carbon cycling and climate change feedbacks associated with thermokarst in the Arctic. Remote sensing is a tool useful for understanding temporal and spatial dynamics of drained basins. In this study, we tested the application of high-resolution X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of the German TerraSAR-X satellite from the 2009 growing season (July-September) for characterizing drained thermokarst lake basins of various age in the ice-rich permafrost region of the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. To enhance interpretation of patterns identified in X-band SAR for these basins, we also analyzed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from a Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper image acquired on July 2009 and compared both X-band SAR and NDVI data with observations of basin age. We found significant logarithmic relationships between (a) TerraSAR-X backscatter and basin age from 0 to 10,000 years, (b) Landat-5 TM NDVI and basin age from 0 to 10,000 years, and (c) TerraSAR-X backscatter and basin age from 50 to 10,000 years. NDVI was a better indicator of basin age over a period of 0-10,000 years. However, TerraSAR-X data performed much better for discriminating radiocarbon-dated basins (50-10,000 years old). No clear relationships were found for either backscatter or NDVI and basin age from 0 to 50 years. We attribute the decreasing trend of backscatter and NDVI with increasing basin age to post-drainage changes in the basin surface. Such changes include succession in vegetation, soils, hydrology, and renewed permafrost aggradation, ground ice accumulation and localized frost heave. Results of this study show the potential application of X-band SAR data in combination with NDVI data to map long-term succession dynamics of drained thermokarst lake basins.

TI Emissions from thaw ponds largely offset the carbon sink of northern

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAKES; MIRES; GASES; CH4; CO2
AB Northern regions have received considerable attention not only because the effects of climate change are amplified at high latitudes but also because this region holds vast amounts of carbon (C) stored in permafrost. These carbon stocks are vulnerable to warming temperatures and increased permafrost thaw and the breakdown and release of soil C in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The majority of research has focused on quantifying and upscaling the effects of thaw on CO2 and CH4 emissions from terrestrial systems. However, small ponds formed in permafrost wetlands following thawing have been recognized as hotspots for C emissions. Here, we examined the importance of small ponds for C fluxes in two permafrost wetland ecosystems in northern Sweden. Detailed flux estimates of thaw ponds during the growing season show that ponds emit, on average (+/- SD), 279 +/- 415 and 7 +/- 11 mmol C m(-2) d(-2) of CO2 and CH4, respectively. Importantly, addition of pond emissions to the total C budget of the wetland decreases the C sink by -39%. Our results emphasize the need for integrated research linking C cycling on land and in water in order to make correct assessments of contemporary C balances.

The metal concentrations were determined on an ICP-MS Aurora Elite inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) using an internal standard containing the elements Bi, In, Li, Sc, Tb, and Y. The determination conditions were selected using a certified soil standard. The highest concentrations of the test metals were observed in the upper layer of peat, and the concentration of metals decreased with depth of peat occurrence. A regularity was observed only for the elements Mn, Tl, Co, Ni, and Pb, and the other metals were uniformly distributed in peat layers and exhibited no regularity.

AB Agricultural soils are the most important sources for the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), which is produced and emitted from soils also at low temperatures. The processes behind emissions at low temperatures are still poorly known. Snow is a good insulator and it keeps soil temperature rather constant. To simulate the effects of a reduction in snow depth on N2O emission in warming climate, snow pack was removed from experimental plots on three different agricultural soils (sand, mull, peat). Removal of snow lowered soil temperature and increased the extent and duration of soil frost in sand and mull soils. This led to enhanced N2O emissions during freezing and thawing events. The cumulative emissions during the first year when snow was removed over the whole winter were 0.25, 0.66 and 3.0 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1) in control plots of sand, mull and peat soils, respectively. In the treatment plots, without snow cover, the respective cumulative emissions were 0.37, 1.3 and 3.3 g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1). Shorter snow manipulation during the second year did not increase the annual emissions. Only 20% of the N2O emission occurred during the growing season. Thus, these results highlight the importance of the winter season for this exchange and that the year-round measurements of annual N2O emissions from boreal soils are integral for estimating their N2O source strength. N2O accumulated in the frozen soil during winter and the soil N2O concentration correlated with the depth of frost but not with the winter N2O emission rates per se. Also laboratory incubations of soil samples showed high production rates of N2O at temperatures below 0 degrees C, especially in the sand and peat soils.

AB . Until the 1960s, species-rich vegetation on minero-trophic peaty sous (fen sites) were characteristic of the alluvial plains in Schleswig-Holstein (Northwest Germany). Today, many of these habitats undergo successional changes due to abandonment. Vegetation development after abandonment can be characterized as a sequence of different successional stages and described in terms of a successional model. Successional stage I includes grazed, mown and recently abandoned sites without dominants. Stages II and III are characterized by the dominance of highly competitive herbaceous species whue stage IV consists of woody vegetation. Ca. 3000 phytosociological releves were assigned to the respective successional stages. Mean cover values were calculated for 250 species of the regional fen flora and assigned to successional categories according to their changes in cover in the successional series. According to our results 141 species decrease during succession, while 100 species were restricted to early successional stages and 85 species increased. Abandonment of all fen sites in Schleswig-Holstein will probably lead to the regional loss of 23 species of the fen flora. To identify mechanisms underlying successional change, the successional categories were correlated with life history traits and ecological requirements of the species. Results indicate that both light competition and limitation of sexual reproduction of small-seeded species might play a major role in the decrease and extinction of species during succession. Finally, conservation strategies for endangered species in a cultural landscape are discussed.

AB The residual signals of the physical and chemical processes undergone in a river basin are stored in the isotopic composition of river water and are used here to isolate and quantify fluxes of water, energy and carbon for a large boreal river basin. The integrated nature of the river signal is exploited to provide meaningful basin-wide annual averages for fluxes difficult to quantify and extrapolate by studying highly variable interface exchanges at discrete locations. The slope of the linear regression of deuterium (delta D) and oxygen (delta(18)O) isotopes for the Ottawa River is similar to 6.0, considerably less than the slope of the local meteoric water line (7.7). This discrepancy is a consequence of evaporative loss from open water bodies and soils and, through a new method, is calculated to be 8.1% of annual precipitation. As well, on the basis of thirty years of daily meteorological and discharge data, annual evapotranspiration for the Ottawa River basin is calculated to be 53.1%. Combining the evaporation and evapotranspiration calculations apportions 45% of the water losses to transpiration. The energy required to drive these cycles is calculated to be 8% of annual solar radiation for total evapotranspiration and 13% of growing season solar radiation for transpiration. These energies are transformed into latent heat. The water use efficiency ratio is used to estimate total fixation of carbon (gross primary production (GPP)) for the basin at 15.6 mol C m(-2) yr(-1). This rate is substantially greater than the export of carbon via rivers plus rates estimated for carbon respiration in the literature, indicating that the boreal forest is a plausible component of the postulated "missing" carbon sink. Comparison of accumulation rates of C in peatlands and the rates required to account for the missing sink suggest that peat accumulation rates are similar to 20 times too slow to account for the missing sink flux. Speculatively, the living biomass of the boreal forest is the dominant sink. Accepting this, the respiration rate needed for a steady state balance between the calculated boreal forest GPP and the missing global carbon sink is found to be around 5.6 mol C m(-2) yr(-1).

AB Acid, sandy soils selected for blueberry production are usually deficient in plant available phosphorus. Fertilizer addition at planting has not been a recommended practice. This research was designed to evaluate potted blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade) plant growth response to P applied at establishment and interacted with N applied during the growing season. Four liter containerized 'Tifblue' rabbiteye blueberry plants were transplanted into 4.4 kg of 1:1 v/v loamy sand:peat mixture in an 8-liter container. Preplant P was incorporated into the mixture at 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 kg/ha rates. Nitrogen was split-applied post-plant four times at 60-day intervals beginning 30 days after blueberry bushes were transplanted. Total N rates were equivalent to 0, 112, 224, or 336 kg/ha. Plants were harvested 270 days after transplanting. Phosphorus at the 60 and 80 kg/ha rates increased plant growth 40 and 31%, respectively. Plant growth responded linearly to increasing N rate. Leaf and stem weight increases contributed to this linear response while root weight was not affected by fertilizer N. Total plant dry weight was increased by N rates at the 60 and 80 kg/ha P levels. Phosphorus applications increased leaf P levels, but did not increase soil test P. Leaf redness, caused by cool temperatures, was reduced by high N rates. The optimum P rate for fertilization of the soil:peat mixture in the planting hole under conditions of this experiment was the equivalent of 60 kg/ha.

AB Two heat-resistant fen itic cast steels, 1.4476 and 1.4777 with a similar high Cr concentration, have been analyzed regarding their microstructures, mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and aging behavior. The differences observed between the grades are related to their different C contents. A higher C concentration ensures a higher mechanical resistance, in particular at high temperature (850 degrees C) and also a better high-temperature (850 degrees C) corrosion resistance. This is related to the formation of numerous carbides. However, this study also reveals that the microstructure of these steels is greatly affected by aging. In particular, the precipitation of the sigma phase and the formation of nitride precipitates could lead to failure during service at high temperature.

AB Summertime measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were carried out over a range of high-arctic ecosystem types in the valley Zackenbergdalen since 1996 using both chamber and eddy covariance methodology. The net ecosystem CO2 exchange and CH4 flux data presented reveal a high degree of inter-annual variability within the dominant vegetation types in the valley, but also show distinct differences between them. In particular, the wet and dry parts of the valley show distinct differences. In general, the wet parts of the valley, the fens dominated by white cotton grass Eriophorum scheuchzeri, show high productivity, also in comparison with other sites, whereas CO2 uptake rates in the white arctic bell heather Cassiope tetragona and mountain avens Dryas spp.-dominated heaths are much smaller.
   Also within the different ecosystem types, a high degree of spatial variability can be documented. The spatial variability both within and between ecosystem types is especially pronounced for the CH4 flux and can, at least partly, be related to differences in vegetation composition and water table level. The importance of the CH4 emission from the various ecosystem types is evaluated both in relation to carbon and greenhouse gas budgets. In both wet and drier ecosystem components, inter-annual variability seems best explained through differences in the amount and distribution of snow in spring and the length of the growing season.
   A large number of replicate chamber measurements carried out over various vegetation types in the valley are used to produce a synthesis of 10 years of flux data available on growing season carbon dynamics and CH4 emission patterns in the individual parts of this high-arctic ecosystem and relates the differences between the ecosystems found in Zackenbergdalen to comparable sites in the circumpolar North.

AB Standard sediments are required for prospective risk assessments so that comparable fate and effects data can be generated within and between laboratories. One approach is to use artificial media that can be easily reproduced and characterized. However, a concern is that these media may not simulate natural sediments in terms of binding and toxicological properties, In this study, the acute and chronic effects of permethrin were compared in two artificial and one natural sediment using larvae of the midge Chironomus riparius. The influence of clay and carbon content and organic matter type on permethrin toxicity was also investigated. The toxic response measured in natural sediment was lower than that in the two artificial sediments, one of which contained peat and the other which contained alpha-cellulose as the organic carbon source. Of the two, the peat-based medium gave a more comparable response to the natural sediment. Acute and chronic permethrin toxicity was influenced by all sediment factors investigated with a consistently lower toxicity measured in the peat-based sediment compared with the a-cellulose sediment. A decrease in toxicity. coupled with an increase in bulk sediment permethrin concentration, was seen as both clay and organic carbon contents increased. Consideration should be given to improving the environmental realism of simple artificial formulations if the intention is to represent effects measured in natural sediments.

AB Important unknowns remain about how abrupt permafrost collapse (thermokarst) affects carbon balance and greenhouse gas flux, limiting our ability to predict the magnitude and timing of the permafrost carbon feedback. We measured monthly, growing-season fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O at a large thermokarst feature in alpine tundra on the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Thermokarst formation disrupted plant growth and soil hydrology, shifting the ecosystem from a growing-season carbon sink to a weak source but decreasing feature level CH4 and N2O flux. Temperature-corrected ecosystem respiration from decomposing permafrost soil was 2.7 to 9.5-fold higher than in similar features from Arctic and Boreal regions, suggesting that warmer and dryer conditions on the northern QTP could accelerate carbon decomposition following permafrost collapse. N2O flux was similar to the highest values reported for Arctic ecosystems and was 60% higher from exposed mineral soil on the feature floor, confirming Arctic observations of coupled nitrification and denitrification in collapsed soils. Q(10) values for respiration were typically over 4, suggesting high-temperature sensitivity of thawed carbon. Taken together, these results suggest that QTP permafrost carbon in alpine tundra is highly vulnerable to mineralization following thaw, and that N2O production could be an important noncarbon permafrost climate feedback. Permafrost collapse altered soil hydrology, shifting the ecosystem from a carbon sink to carbon source but decreasing CH4 and N2O flux. Little to no vegetation recovery after stabilization suggests potentially large net carbon losses. High N2O flux compared to Arctic and Boreal systems suggests noncarbon permafrost climate feedback.

AB The composition, rank, coal facies, and coal pore structure characteristics of 15 coal samples were investigated systemically using methods of lithotype analysis. maceral analysis, proximate analysis, mercury porosimetry analysis, and nitrogen adsorption analysis. These samples were directly collected from the working faces of No.4, 8, 9 seams in Liulin district, eastern margin Ordos Basin, China. Four types of paleoenvironment including a wet forest swamp, an intergradation forest swamp, a drained forest swamp, and a fresh-water peat swamp were distinguished by lithotype and merceral analysis. An R-cluster analysis was performed to demonstrate the correlations between the coal facies and the pore structures. The results showed that coal rank is the primary factor affecting the development of micropores and transition pores, whereas coal facies control the development of seepage pores in similar coalification conditions, especially in a local district and in a seam. This work suggests that the vertical variations observed in coal properties (macerals, vitrinite reflectance, mineral matters, porosity, BET-specific area, pore size distributions and pores connectivity) were controlled by groundwater level fluctuations, indicated by variations in the ground water index (GWI), in the ancient mires due to different accommodation and peat accumulation rates. Comparison of the porosity characteristics of various coal reservoirs developed in various coal facies indicates that wet forest swamp facies is favorable to the formation of a coalbed methane reservoir because of reasonable pore structure and good connectivity. Intergradation forest swamp facies rank the second, and drained forest swamp facies are less advantageous. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past four decades, satellite observations have shown intensified global greening. At the same time, widespread browning and reversal of or stalled greening have been reported at high latitudes. One of the main reasons for this browning/lack of greening is thought to be warming-induced water stress, i.e., soil moisture depletion caused by earlier spring growth and increased summer evapotranspiration. To investigate these phenomena, we use MODIS collection 6, Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies third-generation (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI3g), and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) satellite-based root-zone soil moisture data. The study area was the Far North of Ontario (FNO), 453,788 km(2) of heterogeneous landscape typical of the tundra-taiga interface, consisting of unmanaged boreal forests growing on mineral and peat soils, wetlands, and the most southerly area of tundra. The results indicate that the increased plant growth in spring leads to decreased summer growth. Lower summer soil moisture is related to increased spring plant growth in areas with lower soil moisture content. We also found that earlier start of growing season leads to decreased summer and peak season maximum plant growth. In conclusion, increased spring plant growth and earlier start of growing season deplete summer soil moisture and decrease the overall summer plant growth even in temperature-limited high latitude ecosystems. Our findings contribute to evolving understanding of changes in vegetation dynamics in relation to climate in northern high latitude terrestrial ecosystems.

AB [1] The response of large stores of carbon in boreal forest soils to global warming is a major uncertainty in predicting the future carbon budget. We measured the temperature dependence of decomposition for upland boreal peat under black spruce forest with sphagnum and feather moss understory using incubation experiments. CO2 efflux rates clearly responded to temperature, which ranged from -10degrees to +8degreesC by similar to2degreesC increments. At temperatures below 0degreesC, significant decomposition was observed in feather moss peat but not in wetter sphagnum peat. Above 0degreesC, decomposition was exponentially related to temperature, corresponding to a Q(10) (the ratio of the rate of CO2 evolution at one temperature divided by that at a temperature 10degreesC cooler) of 4.4 for feather moss and 3.1 for sphagnum peat. The greatest change in CO2 evolution rate with temperature occurred between -2degrees and 0degreesC, which coincided with the phase transition of soil water. We saw no large change in the rate of CO2 evolution between incubation experiments separated by a 6 month storage period for feather moss peat. Stable C isotope measurements of evolved CO2 and the rate of change of CO2 evolution with time suggest different substrates are used to sustain heterotrophic respiration above and below freezing. Radiocarbon signatures of CO2 respired from both types of peat reflected significant contributions from C fixed in the last 35 years ("bomb'' C-14) as well as C fixed prior to 1950. We observed no change in the Delta(14)C of respired CO2 with temperature. Isotopic signatures of peat components showed that a combination of substrates must contribute to the CO2 evolved in our incubations. Decomposition of fine roots (which made up less than 7% of the total peat C) accounted for similar to50% of respired CO2 in feather moss peat and for similar to30% of respired CO2 in sphagnum peat. Fine-grained (< 1 mm), more humified material that makes up 60-70% of the bulk peat organic carbon contributed significantly to heterotrophic respiration (similar to 30% in feather moss and similar to 50% in sphagnum moss peat), despite slow decomposition rates. Increased temperatures caused enhanced decomposition from all pools without changing their relative contributions. Because the contribution of peat decomposition is a small portion of total soil respiration at the study site, increased respiration rates would be difficult to measure as increased fluxes in the field. Nonetheless, sustained warming could lead to significant loss of C from these peat layers.

AB The water balance of a High Subarctic wetland was measured in a newly established research basin near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Measurements spanned the growing season from early June through to the end of August 1991. The watershed was instrumented such that the water budget could be monitored over each of the dominant terrain units. The study basin has 5 major terrain types consisting of sedge-dominated wetland, upland lichen-heath, tundra lakes and ponds, willow-birch wetland, and open spruce forest, in decreasing order of coverage. These terrain units, and the ecosystem as a whole, are representative of coastal wetlands underlain by permafrost in the Hudson Bay Lowland. Runoff and thus streamflow were closely tied to the moisture status of the peatlands and to the depth of the active layer. During 2 unusually dry periods, the peatlands remained wet, which indicates a lack of water mobility when the water table drops below the surface of the wetland. Streamflow response to rainfall during these periods was small in comparison to early summer when the frost table was near the surface, or to wet periods when the water table rose above the surface. Energy balance measurements showed the lakes and ponds to have about 15% higher net radiation than wetlands and 29% greater than upland lichen-heath. From 9 to 18% of net radiation was used in thawing and heating the ground whereas the latent heat flux for the various terrain types utilized from 49 to 83% of net radiation. Even with unusually large rainfalls that occurred in July, evaporation exceeded precipitation over the course of the summer. Despite this, runoff was high and required a large negative change in groundwater storage to account for it. The Lichen-heath and ponds exhibited the greatest change in water storage. The drainage of water from the uplands to the lowlands maintained the soil moisture of the peatlands and contributed to streamflow. Each terrain type had a characteristic water balance due to differences in one or more of the hydrologic variables (evapotranspiration, runoff and storage). This has important implications concerning the impact on the water balance of a change in surface cover brought about by a change in climate.

AB In bog ecosystems, the decomposition rate of plant residues is largely determined by the combined effect of abiotic (temperature and moisture of peat) and biotic (properties of peat-forming plants) factors. Model experiments under well controlled external conditions are a good tool to determine the contribution of each factor to the decomposition process. The aim of the research was to quantify the effect of temperature (T) and moisture (W) of peat on the decomposition rate of the main peat-forming plant residues of the oligotrophic wetland in the southern taiga subzone of Western Siberia.
   In a 3-month incubation experiment, we studied the initial stages of decomposition of 4 types of plant substrates at various temperatures (T = 2, 12, 22 degrees C) and contrasting moisture levels corresponding to 30, 60 and 90% of their water holding capacity (WHC). We collected plant residues of Sphagnum fuscum Klinggr., Chamaedaphne calyculata Moench., and Eriophorum vaginatum L. in the Bakcharskoe oligotrophic bog (Bakcharsky district, Tomsk region, 56 degrees 58'N, 82 degrees 36'E) in September 2017. Besides the individual types of plant residues, a mixed sample of S. fuscum (60%) and Ch. calyculata (40%) was also studied. We determined the basic physicochemical characteristics in the original plant substrates: pH value in water and salt extracts (1M KC1) (litter : solution = 1:25), WHC, hygroscopic moisture, ash content, total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, C to N ratio, and some organic compounds (alcohol-soluble compounds, cellulose, lignin and lignin-like substances) by the gravimetric method (See Table 1-2). Lignin and biogenetically related lignans and flavonoids were determined after removal of bituminous substances and treatment with 72 % sulfuric acid. Cellulose was extracted using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and ethanol.
   For the experiment, we placed plant residues (1-3 g of air-dry mass) in 110-ml glass bottles and moistened to 30, 60 and 90% of their WHC with bog water, which contained native microflora. The bottles with moistened plant residues stayed at room temperature for 7 days (pre-incubation period) and, then, were placed in thermostats for a 3-month incubation at 2, 12, and 22 degrees C. During the experiment, the moisture content of plant material was maintained at a constant level by adding bog water. The experiment was conducted in 3 replicates. CO2 emission rate (or decomposition rate, DecR) of the main peat-forming plant residues was measured using LI-820 (USA) infrared gas analyzer 3-5 times per week for the 1st month of the experiment and 2 times per week over the next 2 months. The decomposition constant (k) of plant residues was calculated based on the curves of cumulative C(CO2) losses over the entire experiment using an exponential regression model. DecR (mu g C/g sample/hour) was calculated according to Kurganova I et al. (2018), Kurganova I et al. (2012). The impact of the temperature factor was estimated using Q(10) temperature coefficient according to Kurganova I et al (2012), which was determined for two temperature intervals (2-12 degrees C and 12-22 degrees C).
   We demonstrated that the dynamics and intensity of C (CO2) release during the experiment were significantly influenced by all three factors: temperature, moisture content, and type of plant residues. In the initial stages of decomposition, we observed an enhanced release of C (CO2) for all plant samples caused by a surge in the activity of destructor microorganisms and the presence of readily available compounds in the litter composition. An increase in the decomposition rate at 22 degrees C was recorded during the first 1-2 days of incubation and at 2 degrees C after 1-2 weeks of experiment. At the same time, the decrease in the decomposition activity of plant residues at 2 degrees C was much slower than at 22 degrees C (See Fig. 1-3). The temperature coefficient Q(10) for DecR depended on the type of plant residue and its moisture and varied from 0.97 to 1.53 in the low temperature range (2-12 degrees C) and from 1.05 to 2.18 in the temperature range of 12-22 degrees C (See Fig. 6). The highest total C (CO2) losses throughout the 3 months of the experiment (C-cum) were observed for Ch. calyculata and E. vaginatum. C-cum value varied from 67 to 93 mg C/g at 22 degrees C and decreased to 29-46 mg C/g at 2 degrees C (See Fig. 4, D-F). Depending on temperature and moisture, S. fuscum lost only 3-5% of the initial amount of C over the 3 months of the experiment. The mixed sample lost 6-11% of the initial C content whereas the C(CO2) losses from Ch. calyculata and E. vaginatum varied from 6 to 18% (See Fig. 4, D-F). Based on the result of 3-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), we revealed that all the factors studied (type of plant substrate, temperature and moisture content) significantly influenced the variability of C-cum value for 3 months of the experiment. The type of substrate is the main factor which affected the total C(CO2), explaining 61% of the total variance of C-cum (See Table 3). Temperature and humidity accounted for 31 and 2% of the variance explained, respectively. The 2-way ANOVA was carried out individually for each plant substrate and showed that the temperature was the main factor that affected the total C(CO2) loss from the studied plant substrates explaining 75-90% of the C-cum dispersion (See Table 4). The lowest values of the decomposition constant (k = 0.0003-0.0004 day(-1)) were attributed to the S. fuscum at 12 and 2 degrees C. Decomposition constants for E. vaginatum and Ch. calyculata were the highest (k> 0.001 day(-1)) at all studied temperatures among all types of plant substrates (See Fig. 5). We can conclude that due to the slow decomposition rate, S. fuscum makes a major contribution to peat formation process.

AB Precipitation is one of the major determinants of soil moisture in plantations growing in the saline-alkali soil in the Yellow River Delta. The present study was conducted on a 28-yr old Robiniapseudoacacia plantation, a major vegetation type of the Yellow River Delta, and the results indicated strong seasonal patterns in soil moisture, salt, nutrient and enzyme activities at varying depths with respect to annual precipitation. Soil moisture during the growing season of March to October fluctuated drastically in response to precipitation events and was generally higher than that from November to February. Furthermore, soil water content in the 0-60 cm soil layer was positively correlated with precipitation during the same period but not for the value in the 60-80 cm soil layer. Salt content in different soil layers increased gradually from November to February, decreased from February to September and then increased in October. Precipitation was strongly and negatively correlated with soil salt content in different soil layers (except 20-40 cm). Soil enzymes became less active and soil nutrient contents decreased with soil depth, though different enzymes and nutrients showed seasonal variations. The activity of polyphenol oxidase increased in spring, reached the maximum values in June, and decreased in later months. The activity of alkaline phosphatase, proteinase and urease fluctuated throughout the growing season, with the maximum values in October. Available phosphorous increased in the early months and decreased after August, whereas available potassium, hydrolysable nitrogen and organic substances content in soil gradually increased throughout. Therefore, it is suggested that precipitation is the crucial limiting factor to tree growth through impacts on soil moisture, salt, nutrient and enzyme activities in saline-alkali soils in the Yellow River Delta.

   Carboniferous Morien Group, Sydney Coalfield, Nova Scotia
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID ATLANTIC CANADA; BASIN; FACIES; ACCUMULATION; FORAMINIFERA
AB The Morien Group (Westphalian A - Stephanian) of the Sydney Basin, Nova Scotia, contains numerous coal seams, many of which can be traced across the onshore part of the basin. Depositional environments during coal formation range from proximal, fluvially dominated to intercalated distal fluvial, to restricted marine. Most of the coal samples analyzed in this study come from the Bras d'Or section, a near-continuous coastal exposure of the Sydney Mines Formation. Petrographic compositions of the samples are discussed in the context of the depositional setting of the enclosing strata. The coal seams have a high vitrinite content (70-90 vol.%), with moderate inertinite and low liptinite. Petrographic indices suggest that most coals of the Sydney Mines Formation are similar to seams deposited in interdistributary or lower delta plain settings in other basins and provide support for the interpreted sedimentological setting of this sequence. The coal seams of the Bras d'Or section show little variation in gross petrographic composition relative to their stratigraphic position, although a slight trend of increasing vitrinite content towards the upper part of the sequence may indicate peat accumulation in a more distal setting. Coal seams that developed in the lower part of the section have relatively high amounts of detrital macerals, indicative of higher water levels and a higher degree of water circulation within the mires. The common occurrence of red beds in the upper part of the section and the increase of structured macerals, including fusinite, suggest somewhat drier conditions during peat accumulation. Petrographic compositions of underlying coals of the South Bar Formation (Gardiner and Tracy seams) indicate deposition in a somewhat more proximal setting than most coals from the Sydney Mines Formation, reflecting the overall retrogradational development of the Morien Group.

AB The conceptual and parameter uncertainty of the semi-distributed INCA-N (Integrated Nutrients in Catchments-Nitrogen) model was studied using the GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) methodology combined with quantitative experimental knowledge, the concept known as 'soft data'. Cumulative inorganic N leaching, annual plant N uptake and annual mineralization proved to be useful soft data to constrain the parameter space. The INCA-N model was able to simulate the seasonal and inter-annual variations in the stream-water nitrate concentrations, although the lowest concentrations during the growing season were not reproduced. This suggested that there were some retention processes or losses either in peatland/wetland areas or in the river which were not included in the INCA-N model. The results of the study suggested that soft data was a way to reduce parameter equifinality, and that the calibration and testing of distributed hydrological and nutrient leaching models should be based both on runoff and/or nutrient concentration data and the qualitative knowledge of experimentalist.

ID SECONDARY COMPRESSION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Peats consist of the partly decomposed remains of vegetation, which have accumulated in waterlogged areas. They are often unsuitable for supporting structures of any kind due to their high water content, high compressibility, low shear strength and high degree of spatial variability. The paper reports a preliminary study on peats from industrial sites in the city of Kayseri, Turkey. The soils in the study area are classified as peat to muck. The peats are fibrous at shallow depth and become amorphous as they extend to some 8 m depth. The ranges of geo-engineering properties are generally consistent with those reported in the literature, with some variation due to their higher mineral soil contents. The behavior of the peats is essentially frictional, with high friction and relatively small cohesion. The direct shear tests yielded higher shear strengths than those from the triaxial tests, due to the fact that the peat specimens used in the direct shear tests were rich in fibers and mineral soils. Back analysis of the settlement of heavy rolls of metal wires laid on the peat generally confirmed the consolidation properties of the soil determined in laboratory.

AB Tree rings are one of the most important proxy data sources for reconstructing past climate variability. In order to understand climate variability, it is necessary to get a spatial and temporal coverage of climate information. Summer temperatures mainly influence tree growth at the altitudinal tree line, while at lower altitudes additional factors affect growth. In addition, the nature of soil where trees grow may affect growth response to climate. To decide climate as well as growth-substrate influences on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing below the tree line, two tree-ring width chronologies, sampled at dry mineral soil and wet peat soil in a mountain valley in the central Scandinavian Mountains, were analysed for climate responses and spectral signals. Temperatures during growth season (May-August) showed the strongest influence on tree growth at both sites. Influence of precipitation in the growing season was low, indicating sufficient amounts of available water during growth. However, at the dry-soil site the influence of late winter/early spring precipitation was significant. Strength of the climate-tree-growth relationship at the dry site was similar to that of trees growing at the present tree line, while weaker at the wet site. Both site chronologies exhibited common spectral peaks at c. 3.5 and 13 years indicating a common growth forcing at those time scales. The wet-site chronology displayed low-frequency variations with a 19-year periodicity, where growth peaks coincided with the lunar tidal maxima indicating a possible influence of lunar forcing. At the dry-site, multi-decadal fluctuations displayed a periodicity of 66 years. Both 13- and 66-year periods can be linked to variations in sea surface temperatures of the North Atlantic Ocean, pointing to a maritime influence, on decadal scales, of pine growth in the area. These results suggest that Scots pine in this environment may be regarded as proxies of North Atlantic Ocean coupled climatic variability.

AB Physiological integration and foraging behavior have both been proposed as advantages for clonal growth in heterogeneous environments. We tested three predictions concerning their short- and long-term effects on the growth of the clonal perennial sedge Schoenoplectus pungens (Pers.) Volk. ex Schinz and R. Keller: (1) growth would be greatest for clones with connected rhizomes and on heterogeneous soil, (2) clones would preferentially place biomass in the nutrient-rich patches of a spatially heterogeneous environment, and (3) physiological integration would decrease a clone's ability to forage. We tested our predictions by growing S. pungens clones for 2 years in an experimental garden with two severing treatments (connected and severed rhizomes) crossed with two soil treatments (homogeneous and heterogeneous nutrient distribution). Severing treatments were only carried out in the first year. As predicted, severing significantly decreased total biomass and per capita growth rate in year one and individual ramet biomass both in year one and the year after severing stopped. This reduction in growth was most likely caused by severing damage, because the total biomass and growth rate in severed treatments did not vary with soil heterogeneity. Contrary to our prediction, total biomass and number of ramets were highest on homogeneous soil at the end of year two, regardless of severing treatment, possibly because ramets in heterogeneous treatments were initially planted in a nutrient-poor patch. Finally, as predicted, S. pungens concentrated ramets in the nutrient-rich patches of the heterogeneous soil treatment. This foraging behavior seemed enhanced by physiological integration in the first year, but any possible enhancement disappeared the year after severing stopped. It seems that over time, individual ramets become independent, and parent ramets respond independently to the conditions of their local microsite when producing offspring, a life-history pattern that may be the rule for clonal species with the spreading "guerrilla" growth form.

AB Terrestrial vegetation currently absorbs approximately a third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, mitigating the rise of atmospheric CO2. However, terrestrial net primary production is highly sensitive to atmospheric CO2 levels and associated climatic changes. In C-3 plants, which dominate terrestrial vegetation, net photosynthesis depends on the ratio between photorespiration and gross photosynthesis. This metabolic flux ratio depends strongly on CO2 levels, but changes in this ratio over the past CO2 rise have not been analyzed experimentally. Combining CO2 manipulation experiments and deuterium NMR, we first establish that the intramolecular deuterium distribution (deuterium isotopomers) of photosynthetic C-3 glucose contains a signal of the photorespiration/photosynthesis ratio. By tracing this isotopomer signal in herbarium samples of natural C-3 vascular plant species, crops, and a Sphagnum moss species, we detect a consistent reduction in the photorespiration/photosynthesis ratio in response to the similar to 100-ppm CO2 increase between similar to 1900 and 2013. No difference was detected in the isotopomer trends between beet sugar samples covering the 20th century and CO2 manipulation experiments, suggesting that photosynthetic metabolism in sugar beet has not acclimated to increasing CO2 over >100 y. This provides observational evidence that the reduction of the photorespiration/photosynthesis ratio was ca. 25%. The Sphagnum results are consistent with the observed positive correlations between peat accumulation rates and photosynthetic rates over the Northern Hemisphere. Our results establish that isotopomers of plant archives contain metabolic information covering centuries. Our data provide direct quantitative information on the "CO2 fertilization" effect over decades, thus addressing a major uncertainty in Earth system models.

AB Although methane (CH4) fluxes from northern wetlands in Asia have been described in previous research at different temporal and spatial scales, integrated studies at the ecosystem scale were scarce. In this study, CH4 fluxes were measured using eddy covariance (EC) technique and the chamber method in a cool temperate marsh in northeast China during the growing season (May-September) of 2011. CH4 emissions were highly variable, both temporally and spatially during the measurement period. According to the EC observation data, CH4 fluxes showed a significant diurnal cycle during the mid-growing season with nighttime average flux about 67% of the average daytime values. Daily cumulative CH4 fluxes varied from 54 to 250 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) with an average flux of 136.2 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The observations of chamber method showed that CH4 emissions differed markedly among the three main plant communities. Average flux at the Carex lasiocarpa site was about 4 times and 13.5 times of that at the Glyceria spiculosa site and Deyewcia angustifolia site, respectively. The spatial variability of CH4 flux was mainly controlled by the varying water table level as well as the spatial distribution of different vascular plants, while the seasonal dynamic of CH4 emission could be best explained by the change of surface soil temperature and air pressure. A comparison was made between EC measurements and the upscaled chamber based model. The results from the model overestimated CH4 emission by 28% compared to the EC data.

AB Annual needle production (PROD) of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and pine pollen accumulation rates (PAR) are compared along a 5-site transect from the Arctic Circle to the northern timberline. PROD is calculated using the Needle Trace Method (NTM). PAR is monitored by two series of pollen traps, located in the centres of mires and within forests, respectively. There is a strong year-to-year agreement in PAR and PROD between the sites for the common 19-year period for which both proxies are available. Mean July temperature of the previous year (TJUL-1) correlates statistically significantly with PROD at all five sites and with PAR in the four northernmost sites. There is also a significant relationship between TJUN-1 and PROD at all sites, and T-JUN and PAR at the two northernmost sites. PROD and PAR correlate most strongly in the three near tree line sites, where PROD explains up to 51% of the variation in PAR. On the basis of the calibration between PROD, PAR and TJUL-1, PROD and TJUL-1 are used to reconstruct past PAR. That such a reconstruction is realistic is supported by its agreement with the pollen record for 1982-2000 and with records of male flowering for the period 1956-1973. The use of PROD in reconstructing past PAR can help in interpreting the fossil pollen signal in terms of climate rather than vegetation change and in evaluating the high-resolution dating of peat profiles and calculations of the rate of peat accumulation.

AB Forest industry corporations use quality management systems in their wood procurement operations. Spatial quality data are used to improve the quality of wood harvesting and to achieve environmental sustainability. Some studies have proposed new management systems based on LiDAR. The main aim of this study was to investigate how efficiently planning systems can select areas for wood harvesting a priori with respect to avoiding harvesting damage caused by forest machinery. A literature review revealed the possibility of using GISs, and case studies showed the criteria required to predict the required quality levels. Terrestrial LiDAR can be utilized in authorities' quality control systems, but it is inefficient for preplanning without terrestrial gamma-ray data collection. Airborne LiDAR and gamma-ray information about forest soils can only be used for planning larger regions at the forest level because the information includes too much uncertainty to allow it to be used for planning in small-sized areas before wood harvesting operations involving wood procurement. In addition, airborne LiDAR is not accurate enough, even at the forest level, for the planning of wood procurement systems because wood harvesting remains challenging without field measurements. Therefore, there is a need for the use of manual ground-penetrating radar for determining the peat layer thickness and the depth to the groundwater table.

AB Information on breakdown of peats as evidenced by shrinkage during cropping is generally lacking. The objective of this investigation was to study the breakdown of peat of various degrees of decomposition, effect of pH on breakdown and to relate the compositional changes during breakdown using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy(FTIR). Incubation studies were used in this investigation. Feat with a higher level of decomposition was less susceptible to breakdown. The pH had a major effect on breakdown with high pH leading to increased rate of breakdown. Lignin content of the peats was somewhat related to breakdown of the peats. The breakdown was also strongly correlated to the changes in the ratio of FTIR spectra of the start and to the end of the incubation particularly the 1600/1060 ratio. The 1600 spectra in mostly lignin 1060 spectra are mostly carbohydrate. There was relative enrichment of 1600 spectra in relation 1060 spectra. Other FTIR spectra ratio changes were also significantly correlated with breakdown. The FTIR technique has the potential to predict breakdown of peats.

AB Seventeen percentages of Sumatra is covered with peat deposits. Some 1.6 million Ha is deposited in the East coast of South Sumatra. More over, 63.503 Ha is found in Ogan Ilir Regency. Laboratory soil tests are performed to determine the engineering properties of the peat. Generally the tests use undisturbed samples obtained with a block sampling from sites in Ogan Ilir Regency, but the physical tests for specific gravity, water content, and ignition loss occasionally employ disturbed samples. The tests for the determination of the engineering characteristics involve shear strength, consolidation, and permeability tests. The test results show that the peat soil in Ogan Ilir can be classified as fibrous peat with degree of decomposition (H-4-H-5 in von Post scale) and fiber content >20 %. The average natural moisture content of the peat is 441,933 %. The average results of direct shear test showed the effective cohesion (c') and the effective angle of internal friction (square') are 7.62 kPa and 19.93 degrees. The average coefficient of rate of consolidation (c(v)) obtained from Oedometer test ranged from 3.20 from 0.93 for pressure range of 25 to 400 kPa. In general, the results show similar values with the reference data of other peat soils.

AB Seasonal changes and temperature dependence of the oxygen consumption rate were measured in the surface peat of a floating mat. A simple model succeeded in reproducing the seasonal pattern in Eh changes at the peat surface. This included two terms: oxygen supply rate as a function of water-table depth and oxygen consumption rate as a function of temperature and microbial activity. The model explained well the minimum and maximum Eh in July and October, respectively. The activity of aerobic microbes in the peat was important in determining redox properties in the floating mat.

AB The urbanised peat-rich coastal-deltaic plain of the Netherlands is severely subsiding due to human-induced phreatic groundwater level lowering, as this causes peat layers to compress and oxidise. To determine the potential susceptibility of this area to future subsidence by peat compression and oxidation, the effects of lowering present-day phreatic groundwater levels were quantitatively evaluated using a subsidence model. Input were a 3D geological subsurface voxel-model, modelled phreatic groundwater levels, and functions for peat compression and oxidation. Phreatic groundwater levels were lowered by 0.25 and 0.5 m, and the resulting peat compression and oxidation over periods of 15 and 30 years were determined. The model area comprised the major cities Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and their surrounding agricultural lands.
   The results revealed that for these scenarios agricultural areas may subside between 0.3 and 0.8 m; potential subsidence in Amsterdam and Rotterdam is considerably lower, less than 0.4m. This is due to the presence of several metres thick anthropogenic brought-up soils overlying the peat below the urban areas, which has already compressed the peat to a depth below groundwater level, and thus minimises further compression and oxidation. In agricultural areas peat is often situated near the surface, and is therefore highly compressible and prone to oxidation. The averaged subsidence rates for the scenarios range between 7 and 13 mm a(-1), which is corresponds to present-day rates of subsidence in the peat areas of the Netherlands. These results contrast with the trend of coastal-deltaic subsidence in other deltas, with cities subsiding faster than agricultural areas. This difference is explained by the driver of subsidence: in other deltas, subsidence of urban areas is mainly due to deep aquifer extraction, whereas in the Netherlands subsidence is due to phreatic groundwater level lowering.

AB Our study compared decomposition and litter microarthropod abundance among five plant communities in a mountain floodplain/fen complex located in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. We found that the least disturbed plant communities, red maple in particular, have the quickest decomposition, the greatest number of litter microarthropods, the highest soil organic carbon, and the lowest soil pH. Positive correlations were shown between soil organic carbon and total microarthropods; negative correlations were found between soil pH and total microarthropods. No correlations were found between soil moisture and decomposition or total microarthropod numbers. We conclude that soil characteristics related to disturbance, rather than to the presence of a closed canopy, are the main influences on decomposition and titter microarthropods.

AB Shallow landslides involving loss of blanket peat are relatively uncommon but can nevertheless be environmentally and geomorphologically significant. This paper describes a cluster of 40 shallow landslides, including significant peat failures, which occurred within 2.5 kin 2 on Dooncarton Mountain (Republic of Ireland) in the evening of 19 September 2003 during an exceptional rainfall event. It examines two hypotheses: (i) that the combination of topography and local soil catena characteristics were the primary site factors that led to the occurrence of most of the failures, and (ii) that anthropogenic disturbance to the slopes in the form of boundary ditches or peat-cutting activities may have contributed to three of the largest peat failures. All of the landslides were mapped and sampled within 4 months of the event. Physical, hydrological and geotechnical properties of the slope materials were determined from samples obtained from nine representative failures. Possible controls on the stability of the slopes were investigated by modelling seven of the landslides and a series of hypothetical slopes using standard limit equilibrium methods. The humified blanket peat was underlain by a dominantly sandy mineral material, including a buried soil horizon, derived from weathering of the mainly schist bedrock. Direct shear tests established the respective shear strengths to be phi'= 50 degrees, c'= 0 (buried soil) and phi'=21-25 degrees, c'= 8-11 kPa (basal peat), although back-analyses suggested that the average peat cohesion was lower than this on the failed slopes. Analyses of separate slope segments of the landslides showed that the main slope convexity, where the peat cover gives way to thin peaty soil, defined the zone of minimum stability. Failure of the slope segment immediately above the convexity was controlled by the depth of peat and the hydrostatic or possibly artesian water pressures within the slopes. Thus catena characteristics coupled with local topography (gradient and peat depth) were important determinants of slope instability. Two of the failed slopes were crossed by boundary ditches but, contrary to accounts from elsewhere, stability analyses suggested that these ditches did not contribute significantly to the landslides. Stability analysis of a slope affected by peat extraction also suggested no direct causal association, but the hydrological conditions developed in the vertical tine cuts did probably contribute to a large peat slide. At other locations, therefore, similar anthropogenic factors should be incorporated in landslide hazard assessments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a foundation soil, peat poses a grave threat to civil engineering construction due to its softness and large compressibility in nature. Hence, it is crucial to research on its cementation mechanism, so that relevant materials can be quantified to stabilize the soil. In this research work, fly ash (FA) was utilized as a pozzolan to enhance the long-term strength accumulation of stabilized peat columns at experimental scale. The research focus was primarily centered on the design of a suitable mixture of Portland composite cement (PCC), calcium chloride (CaCl2), FA and silica sand that can be applied for the development of stabilized peat columns. A laboratory-based approach was initiated to investigate the pertinent factors that influenced unconfined compressive strength of the stabilized peat. It was found that stabilization of peat can be optimally achieved with a mix design at 10 % partial replacement of PCC with FA. The engineering performance of the stabilized peat was assessed by performing unconfined compression and permeability tests. There were progressive patterns of increase in unconfined compressive strength and decrease in coefficient of hydraulic conductivity for test specimens formulated at the optimal mix design. Chemical and morphological evidences on cementation effect and pore reduction in the peat stabilization are traceable from the respective X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy results. A key discovery is that water continued to play a role as a cement dissolving agent that triggered reactivity with FA to precipitate cementing crystals for the binding of the stabilized peat.

AB Peat is a complex material with several organic constituents that contribute to its high capacity to retain metals. In the context of uranium mining, peat can accumulate high concentrations of uranium and its decay products such as radium. Hence, interaction with peat appears to be a key factor in the understanding of the geochemical mechanisms controlling the fate of these products. This study aims to determine the sorption properties of two trace elements, U(VI) and Ra-226, on natural organic matter from peat. The presented method was applied to both natural peat samples originating from a mining context, with various contents of organic matter (from 40 to 70%) and detrital loads, and wetland peat with a more than 98% composition of organic matter. In the present study, considering peat material as a sorbent, its reactivity towards metals and other contaminants can be described as that of an ion exchanger. A relatively simple model of ion-exchange based on the sorption properties of carboxylic sites has been applied with success to describe the sorption of uranium and radium. In the general overview of the different mechanisms able to control the mobility of these radionuclides in a uranium mining context, organic matter is likely one of the main contributors to radionuclide scavenging even under oxic conditions.

ID LATE QUATERNARY HISTORY; BAFFIN-BAY; CLIMATE; RECORD
AB Two extensive peat deposits on Nordvesto, between Greenland and Canada, were examined for macroscopic remains of plants and animals. One of the peat deposits accumulated during the period from c. 7,100 to 5,100 cal. years BP. This peat is guanogenic and completely dominated by the coprophilous bryophyte Aplodon wormskioldii, and also contains frequent remains of feathers. The peat formed close to a large former sea bird colony, probably a puffin (Fratercula arctica) colony. Puffins are now rare in the region, but the population may have been larger during the mid Holocene, when the sea was ice-free for a longer period than at present. The other peat deposit is dated to c. 9,300-7,400 cal. years BP, it is minerogenic and the macrofossils reflect deposition in a shallow, richly vegetated pond. This peat formed during warmer summers than at present.

AB 1. The response of northern tundra plant communities to warming temperatures is of critical concern because permafrost ecosystems play a key role in global carbon (C) storage, and climate-induced ecological shifts in the plant community will affect the transfer of carbon-dioxide between biological and atmospheric pools.
   2. This study, which focuses on the response of tundra plant growth and phenology to experimental warming, was conducted at the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research project, located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range. We used snow fences coupled with spring snow removal to increase deep-soil temperatures and thaw depth (winter warming), and open-top chambers to increase summer air temperatures (summer warming).
   3. Winter warming increased wintertime soil temperature (5-40 cm) by 2.3 degrees C, resulting in a 10% increase in growing season thaw depth. Summer warming significantly increased growing season air temperature; peak temperature differences occurred near midday when summer warming plots were approximately 1.0 degrees C warmer than ambient plots.
   4. Changes in the soil environment as a result of winter warming treatment resulted in a 20% increase in above-ground biomass and net primary productivity (ANPP), while there was no detected summer warming effect on ecosystem-level ANPP or biomass. Both summer and winter warming extended the growing season through earlier bud break and delayed senescence, despite equivalent snow-free days across treatments. As with ANPP, winter warming increased canopy N mass by 20%, while there was no summer warming effect on canopy N.
   5. The warming-mediated increase in N availability, coupled with phenological shifts, may have driven higher rates of ANPP in the winter warming plots, and the lack of ecosystem-level N and ANPP response to summer warming suggest continued N limitation in the summer warming plots.
   6. Synthesis: These results highlight the role of soil and permafrost dynamics in regulating plant response to climate change and provide evidence that warming may promote greater C accumulation in tundra plant biomass. While warming temperatures are expected to enhance microbial decomposition of the large pool of organic matter stored in tundra soils and permafrost, these respiratory losses may be offset, at least in part, by warming-mediated increases in plant growth.

AB The influence of long-term farming practices on the soil's behaviour to adsorb hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) over long times was investigated. Adsorption of five naphthalene derivatives (naphthalene, 1-naphthol, 1-naphthylamine, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 1,4-naphthoquinone) was examined on soils with varying amounts and origins of soil organic matter obtained after amendment with different organic materials over more than 40 years. Soil organic matter, pore sizes and aggregate stability were significantly altered influencing the adsorption behaviour of the soils. Samples of soil amended with peat having an organic carbon content of 3.4% sorbed naphthalene derivatives stronger than the soil treated with sewage sludge (2.6% C-org). All other treatments, calcium nitrate, plots without nitrogen fertilizers, grassland, animal manure, green manure and the fallowed soil sorbed less and no significant difference was found between them although the organic carbon content ranged from 1.0% to 2.6%. Thus, a decrease of the carbon content of a soil does not necessarily imply a reduction of sorption capacities for hydrophobic compounds such as naphthalene derivatives. Furthermore, the importance of protonation of HOCs for the adsorption on soil surfaces was shown. Different polarities of electronic structures of HOCs distinctly influence their adsorption behaviour. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cranberry production involves the use of flooding for several purposes during the growing season, including pest control, winter protection, and harvest. The effect of the dissolved oxygen concentration in floodwater on carbohydrate concentration of uprights and roots during flooding was investigated using potted 'Stevens' cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) vines. Pots were placed in large bins filled with water to simulate a spring pest control flood (called late water) over a 21-day period. Two treatments were applied: oxygenated and nonoxygenated (control). Uprights and roots were collected every 3 days and prepared for HPLC analysis to quantify nonstructural carbohydrate concentration. Soluble sugar (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) and starch concentration, as well as total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNSC) concentration, decreased over the 3-week period in uprights but not roots regardless of treatment. Interestingly, the sucrose, glucose, fructose, and starch concentrations of uprights in the oxygenated treatment were lower than those of uprights in the control treatment throughout the experiment. This research indicates that vines in flooded bogs demonstrate a net carbon loss, resulting in reduced carbohydrate concentration available for growth and fruit production.

AB The Philippi peat, NE Greece, constitutes one of the largest fossil fuel deposits in the Balkans and its potential use for power generation cannot be ruled out in the future. In this study, the concentrations of 43 trace elements (Ag, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Ga, Gd, Ge, Hf, Ho, La, Li, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Pb, Pr, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Th, U, V, W, Y, Yb, Zn, and Zr) in the 550 degreesC peat ashes are determined and related to the concentrations in the bulk peat, to evaluate the behavior of each element during combustion, Mineralogical analysis of the chemically oxidized peat samples revealed that clay minerals, feldspars, quartz, gypsum, and calcite are the dominant mineral phases. The behavior of the trace elements during combustion depends significantly on this mineral composition that, in turn, depends on the depositional conditions during peat accumulation.

ID BANKS
AB On King George Island, South Shetlands Islands, a type of peat formation has been discovered which has not previously been reported from the Antarctic. These formations are in shape of mounds up to 7x15 m in area, with a peat layer of about 1 m thick. About twenty five cm below the surface there is a layer of permanently frozen peat. The mounds are covered by living mosses (Polytrichum alpinum and drepanocladus uncinatus), Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) and lichens. Erosion fissures occurring on the surface are evidence of contemporary drying and cessation of the mound's growth. The initial phase of the development of the mounds began with a community dominated by Calliergidium austro-stramineum and Deschampsia antarctica, and their further development has been due to peat accumulation formed almost entirely by Calliergidium. The location of the mounds is near ct penguin rookery, which clearly conditioned the minerotrophic character of these formations, as compared with the ''moss peat banks'' formed by Chorisodontium aciphyllum and Polytrichum alpestre. Moreover, the peat mounds differ from the latter in several ways, e.g. rate of growth and floristic composition. Radiocarbon dating of peat from the base of one mound gave an age of 4090+/-60 years B.P. This suggests that the age of the tundra on King George Island is about 5000-4000 years.

AB Direct measurements of CO2 fluxes by the eddy covariance method have demonstrated that the examined middle-taiga pine forest, raised bog, true steppe, and southern tundra along the Yenisei meridian (similar to 90 degrees E) are carbon sinks of different capacities according to annual output. The tundra acts as a carbon sink starting from June; forest and bog, from May; and steppe, from the end of April. In transitional seasons and winter, the ecosystems are a weak source of carbon; this commences from September in the tundra, from October in the forest and bog, and from November in the steppe. The photosynthetic productivity of forest and steppe ecosystems, amounting to 480-530 g C/(m(2) year), exceeds by 2-2.5 times that of bogs and tundras, 200-220 g C/(m(2) year). The relationships between the heat balance structure and CO2 exchange are shown. Possible feedback of carbon exchange between the ecosystems and atmosphere as a result of climate warming in the region are assessed.

AB The effects of elevated CO2 supply on N2O and CH4 fluxes and biomass production of Phleum pratense were studied in a greenhouse experiment. Three sets of 12 farmed peat soil mesocosms (10 cm dia, 47 cm long) sown with P. pratense and equally distributed in four thermo-controlled greenhouses were fertilised with a commercial fertiliser in order to add 2, 6 or 10 g N m(-2). In two of the greenhouses, CO2 concentration was kept at atmospheric concentration (360 mumol mol(-1)) and in the other two at doubled concentration (720 mumol mol-1). Soil temperature was kept at 15 degreesC and air temperature at 20 degreesC. Natural lighting was supported by artificial light and deionized water was used to regulate soil moisture. Forage was harvested and the plants fertilised three times during the basic experiment, followed by an extra fertilisations and harvests. At the end of the experiment CH4 production and CH4 oxidation potentials were determined; roots were collected and the biomass was determined. From the three first harvests the amount of total N in the aboveground biomass was determined. N2O and CH4 exchange was monitored using a closed chamber technique and a gas chromatograph. The highest N2O fluxes (on average, 255 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1) during period IV) occurred just after fertilisation at high water contents, and especially at the beginning of the growing season (on average, 490 mug N2O m(-2) h(-1) during period 1) when the competition of vegetation for N was low. CH4 fluxes were negligible throughout the experiment, and for all treatments the production and oxidation potentials of CH4 were inconsequential. Especially at the highest rates of fertilisation, the elevated supply Of CO2 increased above- and below-ground biomass production, but both at the highest and lowest rates of fertilisation, decreased the total amount of N in the aboveground dry biomass. N2O fluxes tended to be higher under doubled CO2 concentrations, indicating that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration may affect N and C dynamics in fanned peat soil. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peat horizons are characteristic features of delta plains worldwide. In this study, we tested the use of peat-based correlations to assess the deformation of Holocene strata in the Po coastal plain (Northern Italy). The Holocene stratigraphy, about 30 km inland from the modern coastline consists of a peat-bearing, estuarine and deltaic succession, up to 23 m thick. Through the analysis of 31 core data and 100 piezocone penetration tests, we identified and mapped three 10-40 cm-thick peat layers (T1-T3) dated to 6.6-5.8, 5.5-5.0 and 3.3-2.7 cal kyr BP respectively. These peat horizons were found to be suitable stratigraphic markers within the Holocene succession over an area of about 200 km(2). The mid-late Holocene palaeogeography, reconstructed through high-resolution peat correlation, supported by 72 radiocarbon dates, highlights a typical upper delta plain environment, with ribbon-shaped distributary channels and swamp interdistributary areas. Peat layers are inclined towards E-NE with gradients that increase downsection from similar to 0.016% (T3) to 0.021% (T1). The gradient of the oldest peat horizon is one order of magnitude larger than the slope of the modern delta plain (similar to 0.0025%). We infer that peat horizons accumulated during periods of low sediment supply mainly controlled by autogenic processes and were deformed after deposition. Differential compaction of underlying sedimentary strata and recent tectonic activity of the buried Apenninic thrust systems are the most likely drivers of strata deformation. Based on isochore maps, we document that higher sedimentation rates in topographically depressed areas compensated, in part at least, the ongoing deformation, keeping unaltered the topographic gradient and the depositional environment. This study demonstrates that peat-based correlation and mapping can shed lights on the mechanisms of strata accumulation and deformation in deltaic settings, constituting a robust basis for reconstructing delta evolution.

AB Ombrogenic Atlantic salt marshes are defined as areas of halophytic, terrestrial vegetation which are periodically flooded by the tide and have a predominant underlying organic substrate comprising of wood and/or Sphagnum peat that formed under freshwater conditions. The objective of this study was to determine to what extent salt marsh plant ecology and, specifically, vegetation composition and zonation relate to this underlying substrate of organic matter (peat). A vegetation survey was carried out on nine salt marshes, three on peat substrate and two on sand, mud and sand/mud, respectively. In parallel, key edaphic variables were measured including pH, conductivity, organic content, moisture content and nutrients: ammonium, nitrate and phosphorus. Salt marshes on peat substrate are distinct. Ammonium content was twice the maximum reported in other salt marsh studies, while the vegetation composition of salt marshes on peat substrate was significantly different from that of other salt marshes. Salt marshes on peat substrate were found to be higher in species diversity and richness and characterised by a predominantly forb and rush community. However, some common salt marsh species, such as Atriplex portulacoides and Spartina anglica were absent from salt marshes on peat. Ordination analysis revealed that zonation was primarily associated with conductivity on peat substrates. In contrast, moisture plays a greater role in zonation within non-peat salt marshes. The findings confirm that the high organic matter content of ombrogenic Atlantic salt marshes is associated with distinct vegetation composition.

AB We measured the seasonal dynamics of major and trace elements concentrations in foliage of larch, main conifer species of Siberia, and we analyzed cryogenic soils collected in typical permafrost-dominated habitats in the Central Siberia. This region offers a unique opportunity to study element fractionation between the soil and the plant because of (i) the homogeneous geological substratum, (ii) the monospecific stands (Larix gmelinii) and (iii) the contrasted habitats (North-facing slope, South-facing slope, and Sphagnum peatbog) in terms of soil temperature, moisture, thickness of the active layer, tree biomass and rooting depth. The variation of these parameters from one habitat to the other allowed us to test the effects of these parameters on the element concentration in larch foliage considered with high seasonal resolution. Statistical treatment of data on larch needles collected 4 times in 3 locations during entire growing season (June-September) demonstrated that : (1) there is a high similarity of foliar chemical composition of larch trees in various habitats suggesting intrinsically similar requirements of larch tree growth for nutrients, (2) the variation of elemental concentrations in larch needles is controlled by the period (within the growing season) and not by the geographical location (South-facing slope, North-facing slope or bog zone) and (3) there are three groups of elements according to their patterns of elements concentration in needles over the growing season from June to September can be identified: (1): nutrient elements [P, Cu, Rb, K, B, Na, Zn, Ni and Cd] showing a decrease of concentration from June to September similar to the behaviour of major nutrients such as N, P and K; (2): accumulating elements [Ca, Mg, Mo, Co, Sr, Mn, Pb and Cr] showing an increase of concentration from June-July to September; (3): indifferent elements [Al, Zr, Fe, Ba, Ti, REEs (Pr, Nd, Ce, La, Gd, Er, Dy, Tb, Lu, Yb, Tm, Sm, Ho, Eu), Y, Th and U] showing a decrease of concentration from June to July and then an increase of concentration to September. A number of micronutrients (e.g., Cu, Zn) demonstrate significant resorption at the end of growing season suggesting possible limitation by these elements. Although the intrinsic requirement seems to be similar among habitats, the total amount of element stored within the different habitats is drastically different due to the differences in standing tree biomass. The partitioning coefficients between soil and larch appear to be among the lowest compared to other environments with variable plants, soils and climates. Applying the "space for time" substitution scenario, it follows that under ongoing climate warming there will be an increase of the element stock following enhanced above-ground biomass accumulation, even considering zero modification of element ratios and their relative mobility. In this sense, the habitats like south-facing slopes can serve as resultant of climate warming effect on element cycling in larch ecosystems for the larger territory of Central Siberia.

AB Different processes drive spatial variation in community composition. Standard measures of composition are useful in species-based conservation and ecology, but they may be less informative in the context of evolutionary history and functional diversity. Functional and phylogenetic approaches are increasingly used to test mechanisms driving biodiversity patterns. We studied 28 families of flies (Diptera) with a range of functional characteristics in three wetland classes (bogs, swamps, marshes) in Quebec, Canada. We examined taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional structure of communities and assessed whether rarity is deterministic or stochastic. Beta- and phylobeta-diversity were also examined for relatedness to local environmental conditions, patch area, and/or surrounding landscape. Phylogenetic community structure analyses had high value and complementarity to standard measures. Environmental filtering acted on bog communities during assembly, as they emerged from a slow peat accumulation process and the plant composition is characteristic as few species can survive in these acidic and low nutrient conditions. Subsequently, community assembly happened randomly. Neutral processes of community assembly are more important in marshes and swamps, as dispersal limitation explained species abundance dynamics of small and common Diptera species. The assembly of marsh communities is a balance between neutral processes and environmental filtering, while assembly in swamps can be seen as neutral. Clustering increased with environmental extremes, indicating environmental filtering. Rare species tended to be less closely related to common species. They have unique habitat requirements, and the high diversity is maintained by temporal turnover of species with similar traits filtered by the environment.

AB A fossil pollen record extending from 11 300 BP to the present was recovered from Mariana Lake, Alberta (55-degrees-57'N, 112-degrees-01'W). Initially, the region had a sparse vegetation dominated by forbs arid graminoids, which at approximately 10 500 BP succeeded to Picea glauca forest. Picea mariana - Sphagnum peatlands began to develop between 10 000 and 9500 BP. After 9000 BP Sphagnum-dominated sites decreased; P. glauca declined while Betula increased. From 7500 to 5500 BP Populus reached its maximum Holocene representation in the vegetation. Sphagnum-dominated peatlands almost disappeared. The changes following 9000 BP were likely caused by increased aridity. However, the presence of P. mariana, Abies, and Larix in the pollen record suggests that mesic sites remained. Beginning at 6500-6000 BP the extent of Sphagnum peatlands began to increase. Abies declined in importance following 5000 BP, possibly due to paludification of mesic sites. The expansion of parkland into central Alberta during the mid-Holocene did not extend to Mariana Lake. However, Mariana Lake records changes in vegetation resulting from increased aridity in the early to mid-Holocene which are not apparent at more northerly sites in Alberta.

AB Microbial activity, based on the rate of hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA), accurately predicted suppressiveness to Pythium damping-off of cucumber in media containing light-colored, relatively nondecomposed Canadian sphagnum peat. Suppressiveness was directly related to the quantity of FDA hydrolysed. Organic matter in container media adsorbed fluorescein. Adsorption was directly related to peat decomposition level. In media prepared with dark, decomposed sphagnum peats, that are H3-H4 or higher on the von Post scale, adsorption of fluorescein was strong enough to interfere with the assay. Since such decomposed peats were consistently conducive, the procedure did not yield false readings even here.

AB Sorption and leaching of the organophosphate (OP) pesticides chlorpyrifos, profenofos, methyl parathion and malathion were investigated with four different types of biomass: coconut husk, rice husk, peat moss and peanut shell. Organic carbon contents of the biomass were in the range of 35.4-45.4%. Sorption studies were carried out by the batch (equilibrium) method at 4 different OP spike concentrations and at pH 3-7. Sorption isotherms conformed to a linear Freundlich equation and the Freundlich constant or sorption coefficient (K-D) confirmed that biomass organic carbon content was the principal sorbent factor affecting OP sorption. For a given sorbent, correlation of the extent of sorption with sorbate chemical properties was examined. Column leaching experiments involving different masses of coconut husk and peanut shell pre-spiked with OPs at the level equivalent to actual spraying concentrations in some Thai tangerine orchards were conducted. These experiments included repeated spikings and leaching. A water flow rate of 20 mL min(-1) was employed corresponding to the current average watering regime. Retardation and biodegradation with these sorbents were also examined.

AB A range of slack vegetation in southern New Zealand was described by detailed sampling of four dune slacks, contrasting in topographic situation and in vegetation.  Comparison is made with a slack previously sampled on Stewart Island.  The five slacks differed markedly in the plant communities present.  One slack, where there was considerable peat accumulation, was dominated by the megaherb Phormium tenax and the restiad Leptocarpus similis.  In another, the peat was deep and had apparently accumulated over a long period; the vegetation contained the trunked sedge Carex secta and was similar in species composition to carr vegetation described from the region.  These two slacks were predominantly native in species composition, though the European Erica lusitanica was a component at the second.  The other two slack sites were on substrate largely comprising sand; the vegetation was shorter, and included a mixture of native and exotic species.  Many of the exotic species found in these sites have been recorded in European slacks.
   Communities were defined by Cluster analysis.  With rare exceptions, each plant community was specific to one or another of the five sites.  Even the few community/site overlaps were in the vegetation of the surrounding dune areas, not of the slack itself.  The communities within a site generally formed discrete zones, related to small differences in elevation.
   The environment was characterised in terms of elevation, water table level, and soil salinity (chloridity), organic content, pH, physical texture and fertility (assessed by bioassay).  There were varying amounts of organic matter accumulation, but the mineral part of the substrate was almost pure sand throughout, except that at one site a stream had brought in silt.  In three of the sites, the mineral base was below high tide level.  The water table fluctuated through the year, with the same pattern as described for Northern Hemisphere slacks.  Chloridity was low, but varied through the year.  Some features of the yearly variation could be related to weather events.
   It is concluded that slacks in the area show considerable variation in vegetation, much of which can be correlated with peat accumulation.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-ASH, PLANAR PEAT SWAMPS IN AN ALLUVIAL-PLAIN SETTING
   - THE NO-5 BLOCK BEDS (WESTPHALIAN-D) OF SOUTHERN WEST-VIRGINIA
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID COAL BEDS; BASIN; USA
AB Coals from the No. 5 Block coal beds (Westphalian D) of the central Appalachian basin are noted for their blocky, dull character and their low ash and low sulfur content. The beds are multiple benched, with rock partings separating benches. Individual benches have limited lateral extent and, where thick, are dominated by bright, high-ash coal at the base and dull, low-ash coal in the upper parts. The duller coals contain more exinite-group and inertinite-group macerals than the brighter coals. These coal beds are encased in sandstone units dominated by fining-upward sequences. The overall depositional setting is an alluvial-plain environment with northwest-flowing channels spaced approximately 20 km apart. The channels were flanked by clastic swamps about 7 km wide. Low-ash peat accumulated in areas of the flood plain most distant from the channels. These peat-accumulating swamps were about 8 km across. In a few instances low-frequency flood events introduced fine siliciclastic sediment into the peat swamps, depositing a thin layer of sediment on tbp of the peat. This sediment layer is thicker where the underlying coal is the thickest. These thick coal areas are topographically lower than surrounding coal areas. This relationship between coal thickness, parting thickness, and topography indicates that these peat swamps were planar at the time of deposition. Individual coal benches contain abundant preserved cellular tissue (telocollinite, semifusinite, and fusinite) at most locations, suggesting that robust vegetation was widespread in the swamps and that the morphology was planar. The high concentrations of exinite-group an inertinite-group macerals in the upper parts of benches resulted from selective decomposition and oxidation of the peat in subaerial and aquatic planar-swamp environments.

TI Remote sensing to detect sub-surface peat fires and peat fire scars in
   the Okavango Delta, Botswana
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID INITIATIVE SAFARI 2000; ALGORITHM; IMAGES; MODIS
AB As a consequence of the constantly shifting water distribution in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, peat accumulated in former wetlands adjacent to receding channels is consumed by fire in successive layers as the peat desiccates. Burning peat has been recorded around the dying Thaoge channel since the mid-19th century. In this study, five different remote sensors were used to detect peat fires in and around the Okavango Delta. ATSR data were used to study the annual cycle from 1999 to 2000, AVHRR data and MODIS data were used to monitor the 2000 fire season, and the MODIS Airborne Simulator and Landsat ETM data were employed for high-resolution studies of single fire events. Peat fires were detected using absolute thresholds in the mid-infrared spectrum, the difference between mid and thermal infrared brightness temperatures, and a threshold in the visible to near-infrared spectrum. Lower thresholds than normally used had to be adopted to detect the fires, which led to an overestimation of fires over other areas. The MODIS Airborne Simulator successfully identified the state of peat fires. Making use of a standard fixed threshold, active-fire detection algorithms, ATSR, AVHRR and MODIS data identified only intense surface fires. Peat fires were distinguished only by using a priori knowledge of either spatial distributions or temporal history. Landsat ETM data could not be used to detect these fires. The peat fires have an annual cycle, with a maximum during the dry winter, coinciding with the surface fire season, and a dormant state during the wet summer. Night-time imagery was necessary to detect sub-surface fires. The present area of peat fires in the Okavango is approximately 100 km(2), which is expected to make negligible contributions to regional trace gas and particulate emissions.

AB Pollen data, plant macrofossil remains and lithostratigraphy are used to reconstruct Flandrian vegetational history from a coastal site in south-eastern England. The record at this site, Pannel Bridge in East Sussex, extends back to C. 10000 BP and is the most complete so far obtained from this region.
   The thirteen pollen assemblages zones defined reflect, in part, the complex development of the site. Prior to c. 8500 BP, wetland in the Pannel valley was localized around the site. Between c. 8500 and c. 6000 BP, in response to changes in coastal configuration, such areas under-went expansion and the valley floor was occupied alternately by sedge fen and Alnus carr. A period of stability followed, with Alnus-dominated communities prevailing for c. 2000 yr. From c. 4000 to c. 2200 BP local conditions were more open with Cyperaceae and subsequently Myrica the dominant wetland types. Alnus carr became re-established c. 2200 BP.
   The vegetational history of adjacent dryland areas is obscured by the changing local conditions and nature of the deposits investigated. The problems of reconstructing past vegetation from coastal peats are explored. Amongst these are the determination of the pollen source area, establishing an environment of origin for many herb types, and distinguishing the processes controlling wetland vegetational change.
   The discussion focuses on the arrival and expansion of arboreal taxa in the early Flandrian and human activity. Unusually, Alnus is present in the pollen and macrofossil record from c. 10000 BP onwards. In dryland areas, after an initial Pinus, Betula phase, Corylus populations expanded c. 9500 BP, Quercus and Ulmus became woodland components from c. 9100 BP and c. 8400 BP onwards respectively. Pollen values for Tilia increased c. 7000 BP and Fraxinus c. 5900 BP though both of these taxa were probably locally present earlier. Openings in the forest canopy appear to have persisted after the arrival of the deciduous trees, possibly as a consequence of human activity during the mesolithic. There is some palynological evidence for human presence accompanying the elm decline, though substantial clearance did not occur until the decline in Tilia, c. 3700 BP. This, and a subsequent phase of disturbance c. 3200 BP, appear not to have been followed by periods of intense human activity. Woodland regeneration may have occurred c. 2000 BP.

ID GEOCHEMISTRY
AB Germination and early growth (21 days) of Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis (Lour.) Rupr.) were investigated under controlled and standardized conditions using 20 peats from different countries and decomposition degrees. As control, a commercially available growing media for propagation was used. In the peats, some chemical and physical properties as well as CO2-evolution were determined. Differences in germination between the substrates appeared only in the early stage but not at. the end. After 21 days, only seven peats had lesser shoot growth compared to the control, while root growth was reduced for 16 out of 20 peats up to 70 %. Apart from P in plants growing on the peat with worst root growth, N-, P-, and K-concentration in the dry matter of shoots was not smaller compared to the control; partly N- and K-concentrations were higher. It turned out that none of the usually analyzed chemical and physical parameters could explain root and shoot growth satisfactorily. Instead, the CO2-evolution from the microbial activity in the peats in combination with air volumes was a better indicator for the root growth of the seedlings, though not for all peats. Reasons and consequences are discussed.

AB Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) agriculture is rapidly expanding and requires large areas of land in the tropics to meet the global demand for palm oil products. Land cover conversion of peat swamp forest to oil palm (large- and small-scale oil palm production) is likely to have negative impacts on microhabitat conditions. This study assessed the impact of peat swamp forest conversion to oil palm plantation on microclimate conditions and soil characteristics. The measurement of microclimate (air temperature, wind speed, light intensity and relative humidity) and soil characteristics (soil surface temperature, soil pH, soil moisture, and ground cover vegetation temperature) were compared at a peat swamp forest, smallholdings and a large-scale plantation. Results showed that the peat swamp forest was 1.5-2.3 degrees C cooler with significantly greater relative humidity, lower light intensities and wind speed compared to the smallholdings and large-scale plantations. Soil characteristics were also significantly different between the peat swamp forest and both types of oil palm plantations with lower soil pH, soil and ground cover vegetation surface temperatures and greater soil moisture in the peat swamp forest. These results suggest that peat swamp forests have greater ecosystem benefits compared to oil palm plantations with smallholdings agricultural approach as a promising management practice to improve microhabitat conditions. Our findings also justify the conservation of remaining peat swamp forest as it provides a refuge from harsh microclimatic conditions that characterize large plantations and smallholdings.

AB Biochar is a renewable, useful material that can be utilized in many different applications. Biochar is commonly produced via pyrolysis methods using a retort-style oven with inert gas. Gasification is another method that can utilize pyrolysis to produce biochar. This method has significant processing advantages; it can be carried out in normal atmospheric conditions, eliminating the use of inert gas, is more amenable to scale. up, and provides heat that can be used to generate power and/or help recoup processing costs. In this work, a simple gasification process using a top-lit updraft style cookstove was used to produce biochars from corn stover, wheat straw, and wheat straw treated with glycerin, which were then compared to biochars made using the more conventional retort oven pyrolysis process. The glycerin-treated wheat straw biochar from the gasification process had carbon content > 70% and an ash content of 25% which was equal or better than the same biochar produced using the retort oven. This biochar has also shown successful use as a peat moss replacement in horticultural applications. This shows that gasification is a simpler, more cost-effective means to produce biochars and should be considered for horticultural and other similar applications. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The renewed interest in the volcanic uplands of the Eastern Velay region (Massif Central, France) has led to the discovery of a new sedimentary sequence from the La Narce du Beage peatland, in Ardeche. Several cores were carried out to produce a high resolution interdisciplinary study. This paper deals with the sedimentological data (lithology, organic matter content, grain size, magnetic susceptibility) obtained on core D (357 cm long), extracted near the outlet of the peatland. A set of ten AMS radiocarbon dates supports these results. This study is a first step in order to reconstruct the evolution of the local environmental changes since the Upper Pleniglacial/Late Glacial transition. The sedimentary record shows a gradual silting of a Late Glacial lake (starting after 18,000 yr. cal. BP) and a gradual increase of organic matter content after 14,600 yr. cal BP. The peat initiation took place during the Early Holocene, after 10,800 yr. cal. BP. The study highlights major Late Glacial and Early Holocene bioclimatic changes at local and regional scales. These changes are characterized by high variations of the accumulation rate of anorganic sediments (TANO): during the Oldest Dryas, after the Bolling/Allerod transition and during the Younger Dryas. During the Preboreal and the Boreal, four main episodes of minerogenic accumulation are dated to (1) 11,200-10,800 cal. yr. BP, (2) 10,400-10,300 cal. yr. BP, (3) 9,900-9,150 cal. yr. BP and (4) 9,000-8,200 cal. yr. BP. The major TANO peak of the last episode (4), younger than 8,650-8,400 cal. yr. BP, could match with the 8,200 cal. yr BP climatic event. Since the mid-Holocene, at the end of the Early Atlantic period (i.e. during the Neolithic Period), a slower peat and sediment accumulation occurred. Therefore, only local changes in the environment are evidenced in connection with changes in the vegetation cover, eventually from climatic and/or anthropogenic origin. Finally, increasing anthropogenic pressure during the last centuries (XIXth and XXth centuries) disrupted the sedimentation processes, therefore not allowing a clear understanding of environmental changes during the Late Holocene.

AB Climate warming, increased precipitation, and permafrost thaw in the Arctic are accompanied by an increase in the frequency of full or partial drainage of thermokarst lakes. After lake drainage, highly productive plant communities on nutrient-rich sediments may develop, thus increasing the influencing greening trends of Arctic tundra. However, the magnitude and extent of this process remain poorly understood. Here we characterized plant succession and productivity along a chronosequence of eight drained thermokarst lakes (khasyreys), located in the low-Arctic tundra of the Western Siberian Lowland (WSL), the largest permafrost peatland in the world. Based on a combination of satellite imagery, archive mapping, and radiocarbon dating, we distinguished early (<50 years), mid (50-200 years), and late (200-2000 years) ecosystem stages depending on the age of drainage. In 48 sites within the different aged khasyreys, we measured plant phytomass and productivity, satellite-derived NDVImax, species composition, soil chemistry including nutrients, and plant elementary composition. The annual aboveground net primary productivity of the early and mid khasyrey ranged from 1134 and 660 g center dot m(-2)center dot y(-1), which is two to nine times higher than that of the surrounding tundra. Late stages exhibited three to five times lower plant productivity and these ecosystems were distinctly different from early and mid-stages in terms of peat thickness and pools of soil nitrogen and potassium. We conclude that the main driving factor of the vegetation succession in the khasyreys is the accumulation of peat and the permafrost aggradation. The soil nutrient depletion occurs simultaneously with a decrease in the thickness of the active layer and an increase in the thickness of the peat. The early and mid khasyreys may provide a substantial contribution to the observed greening of the WSL low-Arctic tundra.

AB The potential of peat hydrolysates for the production of astaxanthin from Phaffia rhodozyma yeast biomass in continuous fermentation was studied. Chemostat fermentations of the yeast were performed using peat hydrolysates as substrate. Kinetic parameters were calculated for the growth of the yeast and the biomass productivity was determined using mathematical models. A low maximum specific growth rate (mu(max) = 0.08 h(-1)) and a high Monod constant (Ks = 26.2 x 10(3)) were obtained for this substrate. The low maintenance energy requirement found, 0.020 g (gh)(-1), confirms the aerobic metabolism of the yeast with this substrate. Under selected conditions, a biomass productivity of 0.108 g (lh)(-1) and an astaxanthin productivity of 0.046 mg (lh)(-1) were obtained. The biomass produced had a high protein and astaxanthin content (490 +/- 8 g kg(-1) and 0.43 +/- 0.07 g kg(-1), respectively), indicating that it can be used as a feed additive. (C) 1998 SCI.

AB Biomass and flower production, shoot growth, and shoot N, P, and K concentrations of Chamaedaphne calyculata were determined in a bog in central Maine. Two separate field experiments were used to compare growth, reproductive output, and shoot nutrient contents of Chamaedaphne: (i) over two seasons under ambient conditions and following addition of N, P, and K individually and in combination; and (ii) during one season using a complete factorial design with three levels of both N and P. Biomass production and shoot length doubled following 1 year of N-P or N-P-K addition, whereas 2 consecutive years of addition tripled these characteristics. Growth responses were accompanied by an increase in tissue N, P, and K concentrations. The most striking response was a fivefold increase in the mass of flower buds produced per plant at the highest levels of N-P and N-P-K addition. The effects of N and P were interactive, and both the absolute quantity and ratio of N:P added were important in terms of the magnitude of the responses. Responses to N were typically curvilinear, whereas responses to P were both curvilinear and linear. Although Chamaedaphne is adapted to low levels of nutrient supply, it responds to the addition of nutrients by increasing the production of vegetative and reproductive tissue and by increasing the content of P in shoots. Without additional supplies of N, P, and K, growth by Chamaedaphne in bogs may be restricted by competition for nutrients with Sphagnum.

TI THE BIOGENIC AND PYROGENIC FACTORS OF HEAVY METAL AND RADIONUCLIDE
   ACCUMULATION IN THE PEAT SOIL OF THE CENTRAL PART OF THE EAST EUROPEAN
   PLAIN
SO AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
LA English
DT Article
DE biogenic; pyrogenic; contribution; peat deposition; landscapes; soil
AB The article deals with the evaluation of the contribution of peat deposition (a natural process causing long-term removal of toxic elements from the migration streams) to the natural capability of the Meshchera lowland landscapes to act as the buffer with respect to the anthropogenic input of heavy metals (HM). It was found that even despite the prevalence of peat soil, it plays a minor role in the heavy metal assimilation capacity of the landscapes, compared to the accumulation of heavy metals by wood and bark, which is 5 to 9 times higher, and to the involvement of heavy metals in the recyclic flows, which is 70 to 150 times higher. In the conditions of the low trophic level of sandy substrates in Meshchera, the mobile forms of heavy metals are extensively involved in the biogenic migration, and peat accumulates them residually, in small amounts. The highest probability of accumulation in peat is typical of slow-moving toxic agents (Pb), while the lowest one is typical of highly mobile biophiles (Zn). The main factors of the vertical distribution of heavy metals in peat strata are their accumulation in the boundary layers, i.e. pyrogenic and trees-tump horizons (2010, the Early Subatlantic, the Subboreal, and more ancient ones), including that in the course of vertical water migration. All of the above factors significantly impede the use of peat deposits in the Polesye-type landscapes as the natural site for studying aerial technogenic pollution. Fires in forest and peat areas release up to 43% of radiocesium deposited in peat into the atmosphere along with the combustion gases, while natural radionuclides remain relatively stable.

AB Soil and litter fungi can colonise and decompose many natural materials, including highly resilient proteinaceous compounds of animal origin. The shells of terrestrial gastropods are formed from such a compound (conchiolin) combined with inorganic calcium carbonate. In this study, we investigated fungal communities colonising empty shells of the common terrestrial gastropod Cepaea hortensis. Shells were exposed on the surface of litter from four different forest types (alder alluvial, oak-hornbeam, peat-bog pine and scree forest) and the fungi were surveyed and identified in four 3-month periods. We found 27 fungal species, one fungus forming mycelial cords, seven types of sterile mycelium and streptomycetes colonising the shells. The most frequent fungal species identified were common soil fungi. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant effect of the litter type on the fungal community. Humidity and pH at the locality are likely to be more important for fungal communities than the proteinaceous material of the shell. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

AB Climate change policy for the land sector is challenged by complex biophysical and socioeconomic contexts. A target approach utilising land-use change indicators is often used to quantify and communicate progress, based upon assumed greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reductions. This paper investigated areal targets for woodland expansion and peatland restoration, both of which can deliver substantial carbon sequestration benefits, with uptake typically supported by grant incentives. A case study used empirical data to investigate realisation of such targets in Scotland referenced against ambitious policy commitments (net-zero emissions by 2045). Analysis of actual locations for recent afforestation and peatland restoration, referenced against biophysical data, showed that new woodland primarily occurred on land that was marginal for agriculture, usually on wetter uncultivated semi-natural land, often on organic soils. This acts to constrain net carbon gains. Both peatland restoration and new woodland show tendency to aggregate in specific zones or locations, regardless of biophysical opportunities, highlighting underlying socioeconomic factors. Differential patterns of uptake are also shown by grant applications across different land use groups. Socioeconomic factors act against more ubiquitous uptake of incentive schemes, especially for new woodland on improved agricultural land, which will constrain long-term decarbonisation objectives unless tackled directly. Investigation therefore shows that use of simple targets (e.g. trees planted) as headline progress indicators can be misleading, potentially contributing to policy failure and misuse of carbon offsets. A more spatially targeted approach is required to maximise GHG reductions relative to local contexts. Recommendations are made for improved measures that recognise spatial and temporal variability, as exemplified by certification schemes.

AB High elevation ecosystems are likely more sensitive to climate change. But, due to paucity of instrumental records, such effects are poorly studied, particularly in mountains outside Europe and North America. Here, we quantified water body area fluctuations for the last 32years in 15 lakes spread over an area of 14.3 million ha in the Argentine Puna, through the classification of Landsat images; and we quantified peatlands NDVI (a proxy of vegetation productivity) from MODIS images. We evaluated the pairwise similarity between lakes interannual fluctuations and their relationship with climate models (TRMM 3B43 v7; CRU TS 4.10) and potential controls (ENSO index); and the correlations between water body area and the NDVI variation of its associated peatlands. Lakes were grouped in two clusters defined by their synchronic water body area variability and these clusters define two main geographic zones: NE and SW. Consistent with previous observations of an overall aridization trend, water body area generally decreased but showed large variability among lakes. Peatlands productivity was more correlated with lake variability than with modeled precipitation, and lake water body area was weakly related to indices of ENSO, providing an additional tool to relate local climate with continental and global climate models. The analysis shows that lake behavior is highly variable spatially and temporally, and that satellite-based monitoring is a valuable tool for assessing ecological conditions of wetlands in the region, characterized by the lack of climatic instrumental records; and to explore the vulnerability of wetlands to climate change.

AB The number and taxonomic structure of the heterotrophic block of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria were studied in monoliths from a high-moor peat (stored at room temperature and in a refrigerator) and in the peat horizons mixed in laboratory vessels. The monitoring lasted for a year. In the T0 horizon, spirilla predominated at room and low temperatures; in the T1 and T2 horizons, bacilli were the dominants. The continuous mixing of the peat layers increased the oxygen concentration and the peat decomposition; hence, the shares of actinomycetes and bacilli (bacteria of the hydrolytic complex) increased. In the peat studied, the bacilli were in the active state; i.e., vegetative cells predominated, whose amount ranged from 65 to 90%. The representatives of the main species of bacilli (the facultative anaerobic forms prevailed) hydrolyzed starch, pectin, and carboxymethylcellulose. Thus, precisely sporiferous bacteria can actively participate in the decomposition of plant polysaccharides in high-moor peat soils that are characterized by low temperatures and an oxygen deficit. The development of actinomycetes is inhibited by low temperatures; they can develop only under elevated temperature and better aeration.

Their distinctions, which allowed to diagnose mixture molecular structure features depending on botanical composition of initial peat, its extent of decomposition and specifics of formation are revealed. It is revealed that all mixtures possess electronic paramagnetism. Concentration of the paramagnetic centers (PMC) is an associativity measure in macromolecules and can be used for calculation of the conditional molecular masses. PMC mass in dorsa/mg for humic acids of the studied peat varies from 0,64.10(-14) to 5,38.10(-14).

AB This paper reports on the syntaxonomical structure, the ecological, physiognomical and phytogeographical differentiation of wetland forests in Latvia dominated by Picea abies and Fraxinus excelsior. Data were collected following the Braun-Blanquet approach and treated by the GROUPAGE, TWINSPAN and CANOCO programs. Spruce forests (Sphagno girgensohnii-Piceetum var. Crepis paludosa, S.g.-P. myrtilletosum) form a well-defined community mostly in shallow and medium deep (0.2-1.3 m) peatland. Assemblages of spruce wetlands in NEE Europe point to amazing similarity and little variation from NE Poland and Fennoscandia over the Baltic States to the central parts of Russia. Ash-dominated wetlands (Carici elongatae-Alnetum, Carici remotae-Fraxinetum) refer only to particular localities of the country and lie on wet mineral, gleyey soils, usually along brooks and on undulating ground rich in subsoil streams, mostly in sites without an evident accumulation of peat. In Latvia, these reach the northernmost limit of distribution and are poorer in species compared with the ash wetlands of Central Europe.

AB The Barakar Formation of Sohagpur Coalfield is an alluvial succession consisting principally of channel sandstones with subordinate amounts of overbank deposits comprising finer clastics and coal.  The major factor controlling peat accumulation is the physical characteristic of sub-peat sediments.  Coal is thin and high in ash in sand-rich areas which compacted least and produced elevated surfaces where peat was sub-aerially exposed and oxidised.  Two modes of accumulation of thicker and relatively low-ash peat operated in the study area.  First, relatively sand-deficient areas compacted easily and yielded morphologically low surfaces where peat could accumulate in greater quantity and the water table was sufficiently maintained to prevent peat destruction.  Secondly, an optimal sand concentration in the substrate created intermediate topographic sites where a delicate balance between the water table and the depositional interface favoured concentration of thicker and better quality coals.

AB Aim: To determine the growth responses of two peat swamp forest species, Shorea platycarpa, a shade-tolerant slow-growing species and Macaranga pruinosa, a light-demanding fast-growing species under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration.
   Methodology: The saplings of both species were grown in a shade house at ambient (400 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1)) and in an open roof ventilation greenhouse at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration 800 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1) for seven months. The temperature in both environments ranged between 25-33 degrees C with 5560% sunlight transmittance and the saplings were thoroughly watered twice a day. Plants growth measurements were estimated at frequent intervals. Saplings biomass characteristics were examined using destructive methods after seven months of treatment and non-destructive method was used for determination of leaf area.
   Results: Elevated CO2 enhanced all the growth characteristics in M. pruinosa with a significant increase was observed particularly on both height and diameter relative growth rate and biomass characteristics. The height relative growth rate and leaf area were significantly reduced under elevated CO2 in S. platycarpa but did not affect the shoot or root diameter and biomass significantly. A positive correlation (r =0.77, p>0.05) between stem biomass and basal diameter for plants under elevated CO2 was recorded for M. pruinosa, but not in S. platycarpa. Both species showed negative correlation (S. platycarpa; r = -0.53, M. pruinosa; r = -0.46, p>0.05) between stem growth and stem biomass at elevated CO2.
   Interpretation: These results unveiled profound effects of elevated CO2 on the growth of light-demanding species M. pruinosa, while shade-tolerant species S. platycarpa was not relatively affected by elevated CO2. This underscored the necessity to analyse different species performance to elevated CO2, thereby improving the ability to predict tropical swamp forest ecosystem responses to rising CO2.Y

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB This study aimed to clarify the distribution trend of sapric peat soils in Japanese agricultural fields from the view point of drainage and landform conditions using the Geographic Information System (GIS). To this end, the environmental conditions in the distribution area of organic soils were divided by combining existing GIS databases of environmental factors that consist of groundwater level, drainage condition, landform classification, and grain size of sediment. In order to evaluate the contribution of these environmental factors to the distribution trend of sapric peat soils, we applied quantification method type II to construct the discrimination model that enables the differentiation of the distribution area of sapric and non-sapric peat soils. In the case of organic soils without mineral surface cover, our discrimination model clearly suggests that sapric peat soils tend to be distributed under good drainage condition on floodplains, and with coarse sediments. This indicates that the effect of drainage conditions on peat decomposition is determined by landform condition. On the other hand, in the case of the land covered with mineral soils on the surface, sapric peat soil distribution was not well estimated. Determining the relationships between the distribution trend of sapric peat soils and the environmental factors by analyzing the existing GIS database is a new application. This was achieved by the combination of GIS and quantification method type II, which contributes to the description of the peat decomposition process from the viewpoint of geographical conditions.

AB Well-preserved prehistoric landscapes and sites have been found, buried deeply below the Holocene peat or floodplain deposits of "Waasland Scheldt polders." During the mid-to-late Holocene, Late Weichselian (river) dunes within the floodplain and river flanks were favored locations for Final Early Neolithic occupation. Available living space was determined by the dune topography and elevation of the peat at that time. Therefore, an elevation model of the peat base was created using multireceiver electromagnetic induction (EMI) survey data. Electrical conductivity data of a dune were collected and 1D inverted within a three-layered soil model with variable electrical conductivity of the top layer and variable depth to the base of the middle layer (i.e., the peat). Themodeled peat base depth was calibrated and validated, and eventually replaced by depth data from coring and cone penetration measurements wherever depth modeling from inverting the EMI measurements proved inaccurate. Using the resulting peat base elevation model, a paleogeographic map at the time of the modeled end date of Mesolithic-Neolithic transitional Swifterbant Culture sites nearby was created by chronologically modeling the peat elevation at that time. The developed paleogeographic mapping methodology can be used for subsequent archaeological prospection by core sampling or to contextualize excavated sites. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We reconstruct the paleoclimatic background of buried peat layers formed around the 10th century, which occur in a snowpatch grassland in a snowy mountain in northern Japan. In the snowpatch grassland, peat accumulation is presently restricted by the presence of a summer snowpatch. Thus, the buried peat layers imply that the summer snowpatch around the 10th century was smaller than it has been in recent times. Climatic control of the year-to-year variation of the present snowpatch was examined based on a snowpatch survey and analysis of meteorological data. The observed snowpatch profiles suggested that winter wind speed played an important role in controlling summer snowpatch size. The buried peat layers indicate not only warming in the melt season, but also a possible weakened winter monsoon in the Medieval Warm Period. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Gas and water transport in peat soil are of increasing interest because of their potentially large environmental and climatic effects under different types of land use. In this research, the water retention curve (WRC), gas diffusion coefficient (D-g) and air and water permeabilities (k(a) and k(w)) of layers in peat soil from two profiles were measured under different moisture conditions. A two-region Archie's Law (2RAL)-type model was applied successfully to the four properties; the reference point was taken at -9.8kPa of soil-water matric potential where volume shrinkage typically started to occur. For WRC in the very decomposed peat soil, the 2RAL saturation exponents (n) obtained for both the wetter (n(w)) and drier regions (n(d)) were smaller than those for the less decomposed peat. For D-g, the saturation exponent in the wetter region was larger than that in the drier one for all layers, which indicated enhanced blocking effects of water on gas diffusion in the wetter region. For the peat layers within each soil, there was a linear relation between saturation exponents in the drier region for k(a) and D-g. The larger saturation exponent of the wetter region for k(w) in peat than in sand suggests a need for specific hydraulic functions for peat soil. The 2RAL model for D-g agreed well with measured data, and performed better than existing unimodal models. To facilitate use of the 2RAL for D-g, we developed a simple predictive expression for D-g at the reference point. The pore-network tortuosity factor and equivalent pore diameter for gas transport confirmed very different pore structure and mass transport behaviour for peat soil and uniform sand.

AB An understanding of P transformations in altered wetlands has mainly developed from temperate and humid regions with neutral to acidic soils. Little is known regarding downstream water quality impact of P transformations in semiarid wetlands that undergone repeated cycles of drying and rewetting. The P geochemistry was studied using the Hedley fractionation scheme in the altered peat soils of the Hula Valley, Israel. The peat soils were sampled according to the peat depth and redox potential characteristics. The mean total P concentration (P-t) in the surface peat horizons (1190 +/- 300 mg kg(-1)) was significantly higher than in the anaerobic (E-H < - 220 mV) peat layers (650 +/- 260 mg kg-1). The concentrations of P in all fractions except the most labile P were significantly higher in the aerobic (E-H = 400 mV) peat layers. The predominant extractable fractions in the surface peat horizons were Ca-P extracted by 1 M HCl (21-60% of P-t), Iron-P extracted by 0.5 M NaOH (11-41% of P-t), and residual P extracted by H2SO4 (20-40% of P-t). The source of the Ca in the Ca-P fraction was mainly from gypsum dissolution following the rewetting cycles. The results clearly showed that the drainage of these wetlands facilitated rapid organic matter (OM) oxidation, release of organically bound metals and P followed by sesquioxides and gypsum precipitation. These geochemical transformations enhanced the P-t concentration per mass of altered peat soil and changed the P distribution among the different pools. Most of the P is currently associated with Fe oxides and hydroxides and/or coprecipitated with Ca.

AB The use of the mini-plug system for the production of container seedlings is relatively new, so there is little information on the potential impact of method on the quality of planting stock. The objective in this study was to evaluate the impact of mini-plug growing method on quality of Pinus brutia seedlings, and compare the performance of this stock type with that of standard container nursery stock. Seedling survival, growth and physiological status (root growth potential, shoot electrolyte leakage) were measured after pre-cultivation in mini-plugs, at the end of the first growing season in standard containers and after field transplanting. Our results showed that mini-plug transplants of P. brutia seedlings performed as well as the standard planting stock currently used in nursery operation in Greece. For the pre-cultivation of P. brutia seedlings in mini-plugs, the use of peat and a density of 2000 mini-plugs m-2 are recommended.

AB Temporary water reservoirs built upon peat soil may exhibit water quality impairment from elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Microbiological decay of the organic carbon in the bed with subsequent release produces "tea" colored water which may require treatment prior to use. This paper describes laboratory experiments designed to obtain data on the release process of DOC from soils containing 0.65%, 10% and 19% carbon. Parallel experiments with and without sodium azide treatment clearly distinguished the initial release of a porewater residual fraction and the microbial produced fraction. A one to two day quick-release DOC fraction, which ranges from 28% to 50%, first emerged from the bed, Step-1. This was followed by a constant rate of DOC production over four weeks, Step-2. The Step-2 average production rates were 3.4, 12, and 31 mg DOC/kg(dry)/day for the respective soils and increased as soil carbon content increased. The inorganic carbon (IC) behaved oppositely; its rate of production decreased with increasing soil carbon. A consistent and simple rate equation described the Step-2 DOC production process. This and other evidence obtained provided the basis for developing a mathematical, model that couples both steps of the bed-to-water DOC release chemodynamics. The model,is presented in a companion paper (Part-2). (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   REPRESENTATION
AB Quantitative reconstruction of past plant abundance from fossil pollen data is still a challenging task for palynologists. During the last decades, mechanistic methods have been developed to convert pollen assemblages from peat and lake deposits into vegetation abundance at regional and local scale. Coastal areas are particularly sensitive to climate and environmental hazards. Thus, quantitative estimates of past vegetation are important to better understand their history and address potential effects of future environmental changes. However, assumptions of the mechanistic models of pollen dispersal and deposition originally designed for near-circular lakes and bogs located inland are violated when applied to coastal sites because of different basin shape and wind direction distribution. This study investigates how to adapt a model of pollen dispersal and deposition developed for lakes to coastal lagoons. A new geometry is defined, and it is demonstrated how some of the major formulas from previous models can be used without any modification in this singular context.

AB REMOVAL OF THE HORMONES 17 beta-ESTRADIOL AND 17 alpha-ETHINYLESTRADIOL FROM AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS EMPLOYING A DECOMPOSED PEAT AS ADSORBENT MATERIAL. This paper describes the adsorption of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) from aqueous solution by decomposed peat. The peat presented a good adsorption process, close to 76.2% for E2 removal and approximately 55.0% for EE2. Moreover, the results indicated a probable multi-layered process. Adsorption isotherms were well fitted by Freundlich model. The data were evaluated considering the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order approaches, being the second more significant mechanism in the rate-controlling step. Thermodynamic data revealed that hormones adsorption onto peat is spontaneous under the employed experimental conditions. The results confirmed the potential of this adsorbent to be employed for effluents treatment.

AB The paper demonstrates an opportunity to determine the elemental composition of the combustible mass of plant biomass, peat, and fossil coal based on technical analysis findings followed by the assessment of the low heat value of solid fuel. This approach may be useful with the absence of elemental analysis findings and the lower heat of combustion of solid fuel. The content of carbon as the main element that forms the structure of solid fuel may be assessed via the yield of volatile matter, as demonstrated in the first case. Empirical dependencies of H-at/C-at and O-at/C-at ratios on carbon content in solid fuel, against which the low heat value of solid fuel with a sulphur content of no more than 2 % is calculated, are defined. Herewith, the deviation from the literature data did not exceed 10 %. The second option examines an opportunity to determine H-at/C-at and O-at/C-at at ratios via the yield of volatile matter. The low heat values of solid fuels with sulphur contents of no more than 2 % were calculated on the basis of the resulting empirical dependencies; herewith, the deviation from the known values does not exceed 6%.
   The use of the resulting empirical dependencies to define the low heat values of solid fuels with a sulphur content of 2.1-8.4 % in some cases, gives an increase in deviations from the literature data within 12-14 %.

AB The Late Jurassic Walloon Subgroup (recently dated as Oxfordian) is a productive, subbituminous coal seam gas source in the Surat Basin and can be subdivided from bottom to top into the Taroom Coal Measures, the Tangalooma Sandstone, the Lower and Upper Juandah Coal Measures, which have different coal character. The lower Taroom coals are commonly thick, associated with sandstones and interpreted to form as base level is rising, creating sodden anoxic conditions for peat accumulation. The middle Tangalooma to Lower Juandah contains fewer and thinner coals, and transitions upwards from a sandstone to siltstone dominated sequence responding to inundation with the development of floodplain lakes. The strata then coarsen upward in both grain size and coal thickness in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures, which may be eroded by an overlying unit, the Springbok Sandstone. This unconformable surface is basin wide and depending on age, can be tied into global changes in climate and base level.
   Existing models for peat growth under changing base level and the variability in terms of the conditions of peat formation through time, as well as throughout the basin, are tested. Environment of peat deposition and changes therein, are investigated by petrographic analysis of the Walloon coals, coupled with high resolution lithotype logging of core and organic stable carbon isotope analysis.
   Fine microlayering and abundance of root suberinite, telo- and detrovitrinite indicate precursory peat formation in a mostly herbaceous marsh to fen environment, in which bigger trees are either infrequent or absent, except for the lower seams of the Taroom Coal Measures and the upper seams of the Lower Juandah Coal Measures, where bright bands are thicker (>= 10 mm) and more frequent. No extended periods of dehydration-oxidation (<1 vol.% mmf inertinite group macerals) are indicated until the deposition of the Upper Juandah Coal Measures that contain greater amounts (5 to 15 vol.% mmf with rare 68 vol.%) of inertinite group macerals. Suberinite is interpreted to reflect dense root mats that are resistant to decay by microbial activity. They leave behind their suberinised exoderms, which originally helped wetland plants to protect themselves from deleterious solutes or in case of a change to drier conditions provided protection from desiccation. The most common inertinite maceral found in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures is inertodetrinite, associated with detrovitrinite. After bush or swamp fires, pieces of charcoal on dried out peat surfaces are easily blown away by the wind and accumulate with sediment in standing water. Fusinites and semifusinites are mainly associated with telovitrinites and are likely to be the result of desiccation and (fungal) mouldering in addition to fire.
   Stable carbon isotopes of coal show a distinct positive shift in the Lower Juandah Coal Measures that sets in well before the increased inertinite content in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures. The enrichment in C-13 could be linked to a change in climate during the high stand depositional cycle, marking the onset of late stage falling, where base level begins to drop, later creating exposures and water stress. A shift to a less humid climate in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures could have favoured the conditions for desiccation, mouldering and bush fires, which is reflected in the coal's maceral composition. The Surat Basin delta C-13 isotope trend follows the global trend found in marine carbonate samples from the same age interval that corroborates increasing enrichment towards the top of the coal measures (approximately middle Oxfordian), followed by a shift to more negative compositions, which corresponds to the onset of the Springbok Sandstone deposition on an unconformable surface.

Vegetation changes following clearcutting and selective cutting (shelterwoods with the density 140 and 200 stem ha-1) were compared. The total cover of the understory increased three times on the clearcut and more than twice in the shelterwoods. The relative decrease of the three most common species was from 73% to 3% on the clearcut and 79 to 28% under the shelter trees. Six of the 16 most common species in the mature forest almost disappeared on the clearcut. In contrast, in the shelterwoods, few species decreased and twelve of the most common species remained the same or increased their cover.

AB Potting mixes prepared with Canadian sphagnum peats varied in suppressiveness to Pythium root rot of poinsettia caused by Pythium ultimum. Root rot and population development of P. ultimum were highest in the most decomposed, dark (H-4 on the von Post decomposition scale) peat, intermediate in a slightly decomposed (H-3) peat. and suppressed in the least decomposed light (H-2) peat. Microbial activity, based on the rate of hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA), was highest in the suppressive and lowest in the conducive potting mixes. In mixes prepared with the slightly (H-3) and most decomposed (H-4) peats, microbial activity declined with time, whereas the population density of P. ultimum increased, and root rot developed. In a mix prepared with the least decomposed (H-2) peat and in a composted pine bark-amended mix, microbial activity and suppression were sustained throughout the growth period. Populations of P. ultimum and Pythium root rot were suppressed as long as the rate of hydrolysis of FDA was sustained above a level of 3.2-mu-g min-1 g-1 dry weight potting mix. Suppression was negated by heating, suggesting that the effect was biological in origin. Both the microflora in and the microbial carrying capacity of the peat contributed to sustained suppression.

AB Cryogenic oligotrophic (Hyperdystric Cryic Fibric Histosols), oligomesotrophic (Dystric Fibric Histosols), mesoeutrophic (Oligeoeutric Fibric Histosols), and eutrophic (Hypereutric Fibric Histosols) peat soils were studied on the eastern slopes of the Kuznetsk Alatau Ridge (Republic of Khakassia). Their altitudinal differentiation was examined, and clustering according to the qualitative and quantitative composition of organic matter was performed. The most informative indicators of similarity and/or differences between the clusters were suggested. The group composition of organic matter was analyzed using acid and alkaline extractions. Multivariate statistical analyses (cluster, discriminant, and canonic) were applied for evaluation of the humus status. Indicators of organic matter status, which are significant for discrimination form two discriminant functions. Function 1 discriminates between the clusters (80%) and includes the indicators characterizing the depths of peat soil transformation: humification degree ( n-ary sumation HA + n-ary sumation FA), type of humus (C-HA/C-FA ratio), and ratio between the fractions of humic acids extracted by 0.02 N NaOH and 0.1 N NaOH (C-0.02 n NaOH/C-0.1 n NaOH). Function 1 clearly separates clusters of permafrost-affected oligotrophic peat soils of the alpine tundra zone (>1460 m a.s.l.) from oligo-mesotrophic peat soils of the subalpine zone (1087 m a.s.l.). Function 2 discriminates (at the 16% difference level) the clusters of peat soils of the forest zone-meso-eutrophic peat soils of the taiga zone (832 m a.s.l.) and eutrophic peat soils of the subtaiga-forest-steppe zone (622-573 m a.s.l.); it also includes hemicellulose and cellulose-characteristics of the initial state of peat-forming plants. The humus status of the mountainous peat soils corresponds to their diagnostics according to the base saturation and pH criteria and reflects a general pedogenetic trend in mountains: an increase in the humus content in soils with the altitude, which was earlier shown for mineral soils.

ID PRODUCTS; PEATLANDS; BRITAIN; BALANCE; FLUXES; SOILS
AB The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol (KP) have created a clear need for methods that enable accurate accounting of carbon (C) stocks and stock changes in forest ecosystems. The rate of accumulation of C in plantation forests in the Republic of Ireland was estimated for the period 1906-2002 using the record of afforestation and a dynamic C accounting model (C-flow). Projections for the period 2003-2012 were made using different afforestation rates. It was assumed that Sitka spruce planted in the period 1906-1989 was Yield Class (YC) 16 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) and that after 1990 this increased to 20 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1). All other conifers were assumed to have the growth characteristics of YC 8 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) lodgepole pine. Broadleaves were assumed to have the growth characteristics of YC 6 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) beech. In 2002, the total forest C stock was 37.7 Mt C representing an increase of 14.8 Mt C since 1990. In 2002, the rate of increase in trees, products, litter and soil was 0.7, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.5 Mt C, respectively. Under a business-as-usual scenario, afforestation since 1990 is estimated to create an annual average C sink of 0.9 Mt C year(-1) during the period 2008-2012. This accounts for similar to 22 per cent of Ireland's reduction commitment under the KP. Afforestation on peat soils was found to reduce the net C sink, although the extent to which it does so is highly dependent on assumptions regarding the rate of peat C loss.

AB Carbon stored in soil and vegetative biomass in mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and seagrass flats ("coastal blue carbon") is a significant component of the coastal carbon budget due to the ability of these ecosystems to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as plant biomass and peat. Growing interest in the protection of these essential yet vulnerable coastal ecosystems, as well as recognition of their capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, has led to the need for rapid and accurate quantification of location-specific coastal blue carbon stocks. This study provides allometric equations for the calculation of aboveground dry biomass based on plant height for 18 salt marsh species from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The 18 plant species were also analyzed for carbon and nitrogen content to determine the appropriate carbon conversion factor to use for blue carbon calculations. The salt marsh plants had an average of 1.2 +/- 0.4% nitrogen and 41.1 +/- 5.5% carbon. With the exception of Batis maritima, which had a carbon content of only 23.4%, carbon content for all other species ranged from 33.4-47.1%. The four most succulent plant species in this study contained an average of 33.3 +/- 7.0% carbon, while the nine graminoid species contained 44.4 +/- 2.0% carbon. These species-specific equations and carbon data provide non-destructive methods to rapidly quantify vegetative biomass and carbon stocks for monitoring efforts and blue carbon stock assessments.

AB The mechanism of forest ground fire is thermal decomposition and smoldering combustion of forest peat or duff. The availability of oxygen is believed to influence the processes. This paper aims to investigate the thermal decomposition of peat under inert and oxidative atmospheres. Experiments were monitored under nitrogen and air atmospheres, using the non-isothermal thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) methods. The pyrolysis curves of peat showed three main stages, i.e., the stage of moisture evaporation (together with low stability of organic compounds) (315-432 K, with the heating rate of 10 K/min), organic matter pyrolysis (432-805 K), and inorganic compound decomposition (805-1075 K). The stage of organic matter pyrolysis also contained three steps, corresponding to hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin pyrolysis. Because the temperature of inorganic compound decomposition was higher than the peat-smoldering temperature, this stage of inorganic compound decomposition was not important for peat pyrolysis. Therefore, the peat pyrolysis processes were simulated using reactions of four fractions: moisture, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. In the combustion curves, the inorganic compound decomposition stage was not distinct, while the organic matter pyrolysis stage became two consecutive stages, i.e., the stage of organic matter decomposition (427-575 K) and char oxidative combustion (575-800 K). A scheme containing moisture evaporation (together with low stability of organic compounds) and two consecutive reactions was proposed to simulate the combustion processes. The good agreement between the experimental and simulated curves validated the proposed models for pyrolysis and combustion of peat. The kinetic parameters of main components/steps were compared to those reported for lignocellulosic biomass.

DE environment; geotechnical engineering; subsidence
AB Organic matter in peat deposits undergoes slow microbial decomposition, which causes permanent material change, including reduction in volume of solids, and is a significant factor in the development of creep settlements for such deposits. Microorganisms accountable for decomposition are readily available in peat, although generally less populous compared with other soils on account of the unfavourable environment. This paper presents a novel experimentallaboratory study that stimulates the growth of microorganisms in a fibrous peat and hence its decomposition rate. The carbon/nitrogen ratio and pH value of the peat were adjusted within optimum ranges for microbial activity to occur by blending sufficient amounts of pulverised fuel ash and urea with the wet peat. This process did not adversely affect indigenous microbial populations within the peat. Blended material was incubated aerobically and anaerobically at 30 degrees C over periods of up to 126 days. Microbial populations increased by approximately 3500-and 1800-fold under aerobic and anaerobic incubation, respectively, which was an indicator of increased decomposition rate. Water content, specific gravity of solids, volatile organic content and fibre content were measured both before and after incubation treatment. Fibre content was found to be approximately inversely proportional to incubation period, with relatively greater reductions in fibre content occurring for blended material under aerobic conditions.

AB Partitioning soil respiration (SR) into its components, heterotrophic and rhizospheric respiration, is an important step for understanding and modelling carbon (C) cycling in organic soils. However, no partitioning studies on afforested organic soil croplands exist. We separated soil respiration originating from the decomposition of peat (SRP), and aboveground litter (SRL) and root respiration (SRR) in six afforested organic soil croplands in Finland with varying tree species and stand ages using the trenching method. Across the sites temporal variation in SR was primarily related to changes in soil surface temperature (-5 cm), which explained 71-96% of variation in SR rates. Decomposition of peat and litter was not related to changes in water table level, whereas a minor increase in root respiration was observed with the increase in water table depth. Temperature sensitivity of SR varied between the different respiration components: SRp was less sensitive to changes in soil surface temperature than SRL or SRR. Factors explaining spatial variation in SR differed between different respiration components. Annual SRp correlated positively with peat ash content while that of SRL was found to correlate positively with the amount of litter on the forest floor, separately for each tree species. Root respiration correlated positively with the biomass of ground vegetation. From the total soil respiration peat decomposition comprised a major share of 42%; the proportion of autotrophic respiration being 41% and aboveground litter 17%. Afforestation lowered peat decomposition rates. Nevertheless the effect of agricultural history can be seen in peat properties for decades and due to high peat decomposition rates these soils still loose carbon to the atmosphere.

AB Although peat slope failures have occurred in Ireland for many thousands of years, their causal factors and the triggering mechanisms involved are poorly understood. A particular barrier to quantitative assessment of the risk of failures is the lack of knowledge of the geotechnical properties of peat and its role in failures. In order to advance the understanding of these issues case history data is invaluable. This paper describes a case study from the Wicklow mountains where a desk and remote sensing based study was used to identify peat slope failures. Subsequently, detailed field studies were carried out at two failure locations. It was found that although the full causal factors at the time of failure are unknown, a common factor was that the failure took place in a zone of highly decomposed and relatively low-fibre-content peat. A revision of the standard test method for fibre content for use in peat soils is proposed.

AB Peat, being a partially decomposed organic material, consists of many organic compounds, such as humic acids and fulvic acids, which contain phenolic, carboxylic acid and amino functionalities, contributing to unique surface characteristics. Firing of peat leads to the loss of organic matter, thus changing the point of zero charge and controlling the extent of adsorption. The change in the initial pH of Cr(VI) solutions does not significantly change the pH of the suspension of Muthurajawela peat (MP) materials and Cr(VI) solutions, maintaining a constant extent of removal. The optimum conditions for the removal of Cr(VI) are 2.0 h shaking time, 1.0 h settling time, 200 degrees C firing temperature and an ambient pH of 3.8-4.2, leading to a high extent of removal of 120 mg kg(-1). The sorption of Cr(VI) on MP fulfills the requirements of the Freundlich adsorption model with a high regression coefficient. Further, the sorption of Cr(VI) on peat is a pseudo-second-order process at moderate solution temperatures.

AB Prescribed burning is a common management technique used across many areas of the UK uplands. However, there are few data sets that assess the loss of biomass during burning and even fewer data on the effect of burning on above-ground carbon stocks and production of char. During fire the production of char occurs which represents a transfer of carbon from the short term bio-atmospheric cycle to the longer term geological cycle. However, biomass is consumed leading to the reduction in litter formation which is the principal mechanism for peat formation. This study aims to solve the problem of whether loss of biomass during a fire is ever outweighed by the production of refractory forms of carbon during the fire. This study combines both a laboratory study of char production with an assessment of biomass loss from a series of field burns from moorland in the Peak District, UK.
   The laboratory results show that there are significant effects due to ambient temperature but the most important control on dry mass loss is the maximum burn temperature. Burn temperature was also found to be linearly related to the production of char in the burn products. Optimisation of dry mass loss, char production and carbon content shows that the production of char from certain fires could store more carbon in the ecosystem than if there had been no fire. Field results show that approximately 75% of the biomass and carbon were lost through combustion, a figure comparable to other studies of prescribed fire in other settings. Char-C production was approximately 2.6% of the carbon consumed during the fire.
   This study has shown that there are conditions (fast burns at high temperatures) under which prescribed fire may increase C sequestration through char production and that these conditions are within existing management options available to practitioners.

AB The relationship between plant-available silicon (Si) soil concentrations and bark Si concentrations in coniferous species is poorly understood. The objectives of this research were to generate baseline data on Si concentrations in soils and bark of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) seedlings in Ireland and to understand better the relationship between soil and bark Si concentrations. Seedlings were harvested from eight plantation forestry sites and two tree nurseries, and Si concentrations in the bark tissue as well as plant-available Si concentrations in soils (CaCl2 extractant) were measured. Bark Si concentrations varied significantly between sites and were lowest [mean 790 (+/- 242 SD) mg kg(-1) dry plant tissue] on acidic, organic rich peat soils, while the highest Si concentrations occurred in seedlings [mean 3688 (+/- 633 SD) mg kg(-1) dry plant tissue] grown on soils with low C concentration and higher pH values (approximate to 4.5 to 5.5 in H2O). Plant-available Si soil concentrations were not related to soil C concentrations. There was a negative (but statistically not significant) relationship between plant-soil concentrations and soil pH. A significant negative relationship was observed between plant-available soil Si concentrations and bark Si concentrations, which may be related to the presence of soil from mixed soil horizons forming the mounds that seedlings were planted on. Uptake and sequestration of Si by seedlings may have been related to the rate of growth of the seedlings, as bark Si concentrations were highest on sites that were expected to have greater seedling growth rates. The negative relationship between bark and plant-available Si soil concentrations suggest that uptake of Si by Sitka spruce is rejective at higher concentrations.

ID SOILS
AB The most favorable conditions for peat accumulation in Kamchatka existed during the Atlantic climatic optimum of the Holocene (5000-6000 yrs ago) and in the Boreal period (8000-9000 yrs ago). Less favorable conditions were in the Subboreal period. The growth of peat substrates in Kamchatka in the modern period is estimated at 1.1-1.5 mm/yr. During the earlier stage of the Subatlantic period (except for the last century), it comprised 0.1-0.3 mm/yr. The rate of peat growth in the Subboreal period varied within 0.03-0.08 mm/yr. During the Atlantic optimum, it increased up to 0.08-0.5 mm/yr. During the earlier stage of the Atlantic period, it comprised 0.06-0.2 mm/yr and, during the Boreal period, 0.1-0.6 mm/yr. The most significant variations in the rate of the peat accumulation in Kamchatka are related to changes in the climatic conditions of the peninsula from its western coast to its eastern coast.

SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
AB In the litters (peaty, weakly decomposed, and strongly decomposed) of bog birch forests, the biochemical transformation of plant material includes several discrete stages. The best prediction of the decomposition stages is the set of indices characterizing the humus status of the soils: the C/N ratio, (I HA pound + I FA) pound/C-polysaccharides, and the contents of humic and fulvic acids of fraction 1 in the groups of plant debris of different sizes. The discrimination of the litters according to the level of the biochemical transformation of the organic residues was observed when using the (I HA pound + I FA) pound/C-polysaccharides ratio, which is 6.3 in the peaty litter and 11.2 and 18.4 in the weakly decomposed and strongly decomposed litters, respectively. The biochemical classification of litters in the bog birch forests is in agreement with the morphological classification of litters.

SO RADIOCARBON

DT Article
ID RADIOCARBON
AB Twelve new sites on Kaua'i provide an island-wide view of late Quaternary (near time) environments on the oldest of the major Hawaiian Islands. Radiocarbon-dated lithologies are compared for estuarine sites on windward and leeward coasts, interior peat bogs ranging from 169 to 1220 m in elevation, prehistoric fishponds, and a sinkhole paleolake in the Maha'ulepu cave system. Terrestrial sedimentation begins in many coastal sites about 6000 cal BP, as sea level approached modem levels. Prehuman sedimentation rates were quite low in all these sites, generally <2 mm/yr, although coastal sites in the late Holocene were subject to major episodic sediment influx from extreme events, including tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods. Interior sites are generally older, having accumulated humic clay and peat layers at least since the late Pleistocene. Since the arrival of humans less than two millennia ago, sedimentation rates have increased in some coastal sites, and further local increases (as much as two orders of magnitude) have occurred since European arrival. Evidence from sites containing fossils of extinct terrestrial snails is consistent with the hypothesis that human-caused extinctions have proceeded in three phases, corresponding to losses (generally the largest species) occurring soon after the arrival of the first humans, followed by a second wave of extinction in late prehistoric times, and a third after European colonization. Dating of sediments from fishponds constructed or enhanced by prehistoric Polynesians suggests that this early form of aquaculture was initiated on Kaua'i by about 830 &PLUSMN; 50 BP. The most elaborate example of fishpond construction in the Hawaiian Islands, the Alekoko or Menehune fishpond on Kaua'i's southeast coast, was probably undertaken by 580 &PLUSMN; 30 BP.

AB This study investigates the growth of forest stands (m(3)ha(-1)a(-1)) and its temporal variation during the five decades of the period 1961-2010 as measured in the national forest inventories by the Finnish Forest Research Institute, in three regions, comprising the southern half of Finland. This growth was explained by sum of the effective temperatures and winter maximum soil frost depth; the correlation coefficient between the measured and modelled growths for the regions and decades studied being 0.97. It was also shown that the regional differences in soil frost depth are related to the differences between the temperature sum in the air and that in the upper soil layer during the growing season. Further, the residuals of the main test were analyzed for secondary factors. The temporal and regional variation could be accounted for by the relatively low growth in the peatland-forests created by the extensive drainage measures of 1961 1980, the response of the growth-rate to May+June precipitation, and the extensive application of fertilizers in 1968 1980. The regional differences and temporal changes in climate are also reflected in the understorey vegetation.

AB The effectiveness of Saskatchewan horticultural peat for removing chromium from the City of Regina wastewater was investigated by using two peat columns each of 100 mm diameter, one column with a 300 mm depth of peat and the second column with a 500 mm depth of peat. Wastewater containing approximately 0.5 mg/L of dissolved chromium was applied to the columns twice daily for a total loading of 1 litre per day. The pH of the wastewater was between 4.0 and 5.0, and the temperature was 23+/-1-degrees-C.  The columns were operated for a period of approximately four weeks.
   The 300 mm and 500 mm columns were found to produce effluents containing a mean dissolved chromium concentration of 0.031 mg/L and 0.018 mg/L respectively with removal efficiencies 94.0% and 96.6% respectively.  Fully developed break-through curves could not be developed for either column within the test period.

AB A substantial amount of below-ground carbon (C) is suggested to be associated with fungi, which may significantly affect the soil C balance in forested ecosystems. Ergosterol from in-growth mesh bags and litterbags was used to estimate fungal biomass production and community composition in drained peatland forests with differing fertility. Extramatrical mycelia (EMM) biomass production was generally higher in the nutrient-poor site, increased with deeper water table level and decreased along the length of the recovery time. EMM biomass production was of the same magnitude as in mineral-soil forests. Saprotrophic fungal biomass production was higher in the nutrient-rich site. Both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungal community composition changed according to site fertility and water table level. ECM fungal community composition with different exploration types may explain the differences in fungal biomass production between peatland forests. Melanin-rich Hyaloscypha may indicate decreased turnover of biomass in nutrient-rich young peatland forest. Genera Lactarius and Laccaria may be important in nutrient rich and Piloderma in the nutrient-poor conditions, respectively. Furthermore, Paxillus involutus and Cortinarius sp. may be important generalists in all sites and responsible for EMM biomass production during the first summer months. Saprotrophs showed a functionally more diverse fungal community in the nutrient-rich site.

ID KLIP RIVER WETLAND; SOUTH-AFRICA; WATER; REMEDIATION; BASIN; ZN; PB
AB Wetlands are well known to be efficient at sequestering pollutants from contaminated water. We investigated metal accumulation in the peats of the Klip River, a natural wetland that has received contaminated water from gold mining operations in Johannesburg for over 130 years. Previous work conducted in the downstream portion identified the wetland as an important system for sequestering metals. We focused on the upstream section of the wetland, more proximal to the source of acid mine drainage, to provide a better understanding of the pollutant sources and the role of the wetland in pollutant attenuation. Geochemical and mineralogical analyses of peat cores revealed considerable metal enrichments in the peat ash, particularly in Co, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cu and U. Metal concentrations are typically between 4 to 8 times higher than those previously reported for the downstream, more distal portion of the wetland. The distribution of metal accumulation within the peat profiles suggests that contamination arises from a combination of sources and processes. Elevated concentrations in the shallow peat are attributed to the input of contaminated surface water via tributaries that drain the Central Rand Goldfield, whereas enrichments in the deeper peat suggest significant sub-surface inflow of contaminated water through the underlying dolomitic rocks. Metal immobilisation occurs through a combination of mechanisms, which include the precipitation of gypsum, metal sulfides,Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and phosphates. Our study highlights the environmental and economic importance of natural wetland systems which have the ability to accumulate large quantities of metals and thus remediate polluted waters.
   Significance:
   Considerable levels of metal accumulation are observed within the Klip River wetland peats.
   The wetland is effective in remediating highly polluted water emanating from the Witwatersrand Basin.
   The Klip River system is important for the region's future water supply.

AB Canada's boreal forest represents an important contributor of the world's wood supply industry. However, maintaining or increasing productivity of the boreal forest may be challenging in areas dominated by forested peatlands. Moreover, sustainable management of these forests must also consider other important aspects of the forest ecosystem such as biodiversity and carbon sequestration. To address these concerns, ecosystem-based management has been implemented in some Canadian jurisdictions, such as in regions where a large portion of the boreal forest is dominated by forested peatlands. The objectives of this paper are (1) to summarize our current understanding of how natural disturbances influence stand dynamics and biodiversity in forested peatlands, and (2) to review the main differences between natural and managed forest stands with respect to soil properties, stand productivity, understory plant communities. We also discuss how even-age management regime succeeds or fails to preserve old forests and how this loss affects both forest structure and habitat diversity at the landscape level. We conclude by showing how, in boreal forested peatlands, forest management could contribute to carbon sequestration and mitigate projected climate change.

AB Regular landscape patterning arises from spatially-dependent feedbacks, and can undergo catastrophic loss in response to changing landscape drivers. The central Everglades (Florida, USA) historically exhibited regular, linear, flow-parallel orientation of high-elevation sawgrass ridges and low-elevation sloughs that has degraded due to hydrologic modification. In this study, we use a meta-ecosystem approach to model a mechanism for the establishment, persistence, and loss of this landscape. The discharge competence (or self-organizing canal) hypothesis assumes non-linear relationships between peat accretion and water depth, and describes flow-dependent feedbacks of microtopography on water depth. Closed-form model solutions demonstrate that 1) this mechanism can produce spontaneous divergence of local elevation; 2) divergent and homogenous states can exhibit global bi-stability; and 3) feedbacks that produce divergence act anisotropically. Thus, discharge competence and non-linear peat accretion dynamics may explain the establishment, persistence, and loss of landscape pattern, even in the absence of other spatial feedbacks. Our model provides specific, testable predictions that may allow discrimination between the self-organizing canal hypotheses and competing explanations. The potential for global bi-stability suggested by our model suggests that hydrologic restoration may not re-initiate spontaneous pattern establishment, particularly where distinct soil elevation modes have been lost. As a result, we recommend that management efforts should prioritize maintenance of historic hydroperiods in areas of conserved pattern over restoration of hydrologic regimes in degraded regions. This study illustrates the value of simple meta-ecosystem models for investigation of spatial processes.

AB Results from monitoring and experimental studies representing various elements of climatic change are presented to evaluate the concurrent dynamics of vegetation types as well as species-specific responses to climatic variations. The studies were carried out in the high-arctic valley of Zackenbergdalen in Northeast Greenland. Vegetation type dynamics and land surface phenology were studied through the use of hand-held sensors of reflection of vegetation, from which the far red normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI-FR) can be inferred. Furthermore, species-specific dynamics were studied through measures of timing and magnitude of flowering through a period of 10 years.
   Time of snowmelt and temperature were the major controlling factors for the timing of the phenology in the six vegetation types: fell-field, Dryas heath, Cassiope heath, Salix heath, grassland, and fen. Snowmelt had a linear positive effect on the timing of the maximum of the growing season, with late snowmelt, causing a later occurrence of the maximum. While higher summed temperatures during the green-up period (time from snowmelt to maximum) also was shown to be positively related to the timing of the maximum, enhanced flower production seemed to cause lower vegetative biomass production and hence a later maximum.
   The seasonal vegetative production, expressed as the seasonal integrated NDVI-FR (SINDVI), had a linear negative relation with the temperatures during the previous summer. This was probably due to higher temperatures causing more flowers the following year, leading to a lower NDVI-FR.
   A strong negative trend in maximum NDVI-FR is documented in all six vegetation types during the years from 1999 to 2006 with a decrease of 0.01 NDVI-FR per year. The main reason could be drying of the upper soil layers due to earlier snowmelt and higher evapotranspiration during recent years.
   Some general trends in phenological characteristics were recognised, although responses varied among species. The time of snow disappearance was the main determinant for onset of flowering. Shrubs seemed to be superior in taking advantage of an early snowmelt with respect to initiation of flowering. In addition, most species developed flowers and seed capsules faster when temperatures increased. More flowers increase the chance of cross-pollination and hence, offer an increased possibility for sexual reproduction and genetic exchange. Most species increased the number of flowers in years following a warm growing season in the previous year, although some species also depended on climatic conditions in the current year prior to onset of flowering.
   Experimental manipulations of growing season length, temperature and incoming radiation in plots with the dominant dwarf shrub, white arctic bell-heather Cassiope tetragona, confirmed that this species significantly reduced flowering when subjected to shading or reduced growing season length.
   Based on current predictions for climatic changes in the Zackenberg area (Stendel et al., 2008, this volume), it is expected that the plant species currently present will be able to put more effort in sexual reproduction, thus ensuring increased species adaptedness to changing climate through enhanced genetic variance. However, this is provided that seeds are able to germinate, that species are not out-competed by faster growing and canopy-forming invading species, and that species are able to continue flowering even under reduced light levels caused by an increased cloud-cover.

AB Peat depositional environments, the sites where and conditions under which peat accumulates, significantly influence a resultant coal's physical properties, chemical composition, and coal utilization behavior. Recognition of peat depositional environments for coal is a challenging endeavor because coal's observed compositional properties not only result from a variety of geological processes operating during peat accumulation, but also reflect the influence of adjoining or external depositional sedimentary environments and alteration during later diagenesis and/or epigenesis. The maceral or microlithotype composition of any one layer of peat can be the product of years or decades of plant growth, death, decay, and post-burial infiltration by roots in addition to the symbiotic, mutualistic, parasitic, and saprophytic relationships with non-plant biota, such as arthropods, fungi, and bacteria. The overprint of increasing thermal maturation and fluid migration through time on the resulting coal can make these relationships difficult to recognize. Therefore, published models based on maceral composition alone must be used with great caution. Lipid compositions, even from lipid-poor low-rank coals, can provide important information about depositional environments and paleoclimate, especially if combined with the results of organic petrography and paleontological studies. Just as sulfur derived from seawater provides environmental clues, the ratios of two particularly relevant trace elements rather than a single trace element can be used to interpret peat depositional environments. Epigenetic minerals, as well as their corresponding chemical compositions should not be used for such a purpose; similarly, resistant terrigenous minerals deposited during peat accumulation in many cases should be used with considerable caution. The interactions of the biota present in the peat-forming ecosystem, often determined using palynological and geochemical proxies, and their interpretation in the context of geography and paleoclimate are important means for deciphering peat depositional environments. Overall, a combination of evidence from geochemistry, mineralogy, palynology, and petrology of coal and from stratigraphy, sedimentology, and sedimentary facies of related rocks is necessary for accurate and comprehensive determination of depositional environments. The need for interdisciplinary studies is underscored by peat compositional properties, which have been greatly affected by various processes during the syngenetic, diagenetic or epigenetic stages of coal formation.

AB Sequestration of organic matter by peat accumulation constitutes a primary sink for carbon in the global carbon cycle. The processes that control the formation and storage of peat at geological time scales are poorly understood but are of a non-solved issue of fundamental importance for understanding the global climate system. We analyzed a 7 million years long terrestrial record of Late Oligocene age from the As Pontes Basin in Northern Spain, which demonstrates that minima in the 405-kyr and 2.4-Myr eccentricity cycles play a key role in peat formation. Such nodes exhibit reduced precession amplitudes, thus avoiding extremes in seasons and seasonal contrast for a prolonged period of time. In the As Pontes Basin, this orbital configuration is associated with a decrease in siliciclastic sedimentation and enhanced peat formation. Feedbacks between equilibrium landscapes and ecosystem stability will lead to a deceleration of weathering and erosion rates in catchment areas and to minimum and stable sediment flux along the sediment routing system. Mid-latitude peat burial could contribute to disturb the carbon cycle by removing (atmospheric) carbon at times of minimum eccentricity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SPHAGNUM PEAT
AB Gypsum binder is a quick-setting and fast-hardening material that is used widely in the construction industry for plastering and as an ingredient of concrete, other binding materials, etc. The issue addressed here is its short shelf life (around three months) which arises because it is hygroscopic, i.e. it readily absorbs moisture and begins to set during transport and storage. The main methods that are currently available for protecting gypsum binder against unwanted exposure to moisture and water vapour are considered, and hydrophobic modification with the bitumen released during peat thermolysis (a method previously considered for cement) is proposed as a promising alternative. Because there is overlap in the temperature ranges used in the manufacture of gypsum binder and those required for the initial stages of thermal decomposition of the organic matter in peat, it is expected that hydrophobisation could be achieved during the established manufacturing process without any changes to plant or procedures. The optimum concentration of organic (peat) additive for gypsum rock mined from the Shushokskoye deposit in Russia is derived experimentally. With 0.5-1 % of peat additive, the strength grading of the gypsum plaster is preserved and its storage time without caking and hydration increases, even under adverse conditions (100 % relative humidity). The proposed method is compatible with current gypsum production technology, it does not require any changes in equipment, and the prices of mineral raw materials and semi-finished peat products are approximately the same. Thus, the incorporation of hydrophobic modification using peat into the manufacturing process for gypsum binder is unlikely to increase the cost of the product.

AB Thawing permafrost and the resulting microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon (C) is one of the most significant potential feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a changing climate. In this article we present an overview of the global permafrost C pool and of the processes that might transfer this C into the atmosphere, as well as the associated ecosystem changes that occur with thawing. We show that accounting for C stored deep in the permafrost more than doubles previous high-latitude inventory estimates, with this new estimate equivalent to twice the atmospheric C pool. The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastrophically exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be altered by climate change along with thawing permafrost, such as growing season length, plant growth rates and species composition, and ecosystem energy exchange. However, these processes do not appear to be able to compensate for C release from thawing permafrost, making it likely that the net effect of widespread permafrost thawing will be a positive feedback to a warming climate.

AB Pollen, palynomorphs, and rhizopods were studied from several < 1 m thick, peaty and silty sediment sections on southwestern October Revolution Island, Severnaya Zemlya. Six AMS radiocarbon ages from the sections show that peat accumulation started at ca. 11,500 and stopped after 9500 cal. yr BP, consistent with several previously reported 14 C ages. Open steppe-like vegetation existed on the island during the late Glacial, shortly before the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Environmental conditions on the island were most favourable for local biota during the early Holocene, ca. 11,500-9500 cal. yr BR when tundra-like sedge-grass communities dominated the vegetation. Low shrub tundra associations with dwarf birch and willow grew in more wind-sheltered localities. The temperatures during the growing season were at least 4 degrees C higher than today. The Vavilov Ice Cap was at or behind its present margins. Environmental conditions in the region changed significantly ca. 9400 cal. yr BP as a result of colder and drier conditions, when vegetation became similar to the modern, sparse lichen-moss-grass cover.

AB Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is an important grain legume crop, mostly grown in semi-arid environments and often faces intermittent drought spells during different growth stages, which severely hamper its yield. This study, comprising of three separate experiments, was conducted to evaluate the potential of seed priming with CaCl2 in improving drought tolerance in lentil. In the first experiment, lentil seeds were hydroprimed (water) or osmoprimed with 0.5 and 1% CaCl2; while non-primed seeds were taken as control. In the second and third experiments, lentil seeds were subjected to pre-optimized osmopriming (1% CaCl2) and hydropriming followed by surface drying or re-drying of primed seeds to original weight. The first two experiments were conducted in petri plates, while, in experiment 3, seeds were planted in plastic pots containing peat moss, maintained at 75% water holding capacity (WHC; well-watered) or 50% WHC (water deficit). Hydropriming and osmopriming improved seed germination, seedling growth, biomass production, chlorophyll intensity, sugar accumulation and reduced the oxidative stress in lentil under water deficit. However, osmopriming (1% CaCl2) was more effective than the hydropriming in improving the lentil growth, biomass production, Ca accumulation and sugar metabolism under both well-watered and water deficit conditions. Seed surface drying, after priming, was more beneficial in improving the lentil performance, under both well-watered and water deficit conditions, than re-drying to original weight. Osmopriming (1% CaCl2) increased the seeding dry weight (67%), SPAD value (140%), leaf Ca concentration (56%), alpha-amylase activity (55%), total soluble sugars (48%) and reduced malanodialdehyde content (35.9%) and total antioxidant activity (29.2%) than un-primed seeds under water deficit. In conclusion, osmopriming improved the lentil performance under optimal and water deficit conditions through early and synchronized emergence, better sugar and Ca accumulation which reduced the oxidative damage and resulted in better seedling growth and biomass production.

AB Over the past millennium, there have been several precipitation temperature cycles characterized by instabilities in the eastern monsoon region in China, but the processes, factors, and anthropogenic activities potentially responsible remain poorly understood. In this study, we present an analysis of phytoliths from borehole core drilled through an ombrotrophic peat mire in Jiangxi Province, China. Our results record three climatic episodes over the past 1300 year: a warmer interval, c. 800-1305 CE, similar to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP); a cooler interval, c. 1305-1860 CE, similar to the Little Ice Age (LIA); and another warmer interval, as the climate entered the Present Warm Period (PWP) after c. 1860 CE. Quantitative analysis of phytolith assemblages demonstrates that the MWP comprised two intervals: the early MWP, c. 800-1140 CE, was progressively wetter in a warm dry setting and late MWP, c. 1140-1305 CE, was warm and humid. The LIA also comprised two intervals: the early LIA, c. 1305-1610 CE, was cool and dry, and the late LIA, c. 1610-1860 CE was cool and humid. Some abrupt climate events occurred at: (1) c. 1050, 1110-1130, and 1780-1845 CE (wet events); (2) c. 1980-1990 CE (dry events); (3) c. 920 and 1770 CE (warm events); (4) c. 980 and 1050 CE (cold events). The transition from the MWP to the LIA, as indicated by phytoliths, was a gradual process that took c. 100 years, and exhibited frequent temperature fluctuations. Correlations between the phytolith assemblages and the solar activity, East Asia Summer Monsoon, El Nino, and La Nina are evident. Solar maxima and La Nina-like conditions are related to warmer and humid conditions that led to clay sand accumulation during the MWP. Solar minima and El Nino-like conditions were associated with a cold and wet climate that led to peat accumulation during the LIA. These observations provide important insights into paleoclimatic change in the eastern monsoonal region of China, and provide a basis on which to understand the response of the Xishan Mountains in SE China to the MWP and LIA, and explore centennial-scale climate fluctuations and their driving mechanisms.

AB Biochar can be produced from several organic sources with varying nutrients and metal concentrations. Four commercial grade biochars were evaluated as peat substitute. Biochars were characterised for plant nutrients and for biological stability. The results showed that there were negligible quantities of N and P and generally high levels of K and high biological stability. When these materials were mixed with peat at 10, 25 and 50% and nutrients were added to bring them to the same level of nutrients as in fertilized peat, it was found that biochar mixtures considerably reduced the levels of calcium chloride/DTPA (CAT) extractable N (including nitrate), P, and electrical conductivity greater extent with higher rates of biochar addition except for K. The pH and K levels were increased with biochar addition. The drop in EC has important implications regarding the use of other materials used to dilute peat, for example, corn posted green waste, the rate of dilution is limited due to high EC and biochar addition gives the potential for higher peat dilution of these materials. Nitrate and phosphorus are very vulnerable to leaching of these nutrients in the environment in peat substrates and the binding of these by biochar has implication for leaching and nutrient application strategy. Root development using Cress test and tomato plant height and biomass using containers, were in some cases better than peat indicating that biochar could be used to dilute peat e.g. for seedling production where root development and rapid growth are very important. Application of biochars resulted in a marked reduction of N (and P) in the plant. There were significant correlation between CAT extractable N and P and corresponding plant concentration, indicating the standard growing media test, CAT, would be suitable for assessing the nutrient status of peat biochar mixes.

DT Article
AB The geochemical characteristics of peats and regularities in the distribution of mineral components have been studied in pent deposits in the Altai piedmont. These regularities depend on a number of factors including the closeness of the studied deposits to source areas, the petrographic compositions of rooks in these areas, the geomorphologic position of drainage systems and peat deposits, the amount of a mineral substance input, acid the intensity of postsedimentation processes. For the first time, we have traced regularities of gold transformation in peats and revealed a trend of gold accumulation caused by diagenetic alterations. It was shown that element concentrations in peats exceeding clarkes could he used as a criterion for prospecting ore accumulations in source areas. The use of systems analysis for establishing the genetic nature of minerals allows us to trace mineral-formation processes at various stages of sedimentation and diagenesis and assess the possibility of discovering ore formation products.

AB The Drama basin is a typical intermontane basin (2,300 km(2)) in northern Greece filled with detrital and lacustrine sediments containing peat/lignite seams. In the southwestern part of the basin (Philippi sub-basin) peat accumulated practically until the present. Specific conductivity and pH, as well as contents of major ions and trace elements have been determined in 20 surface and shallow groundwater samples collected across the basin. Water composition reflects the dominance of carbonate rocks in the whole basin. Peat oxidation an mineralization contribute to poor element enrichment of the Philippi sub-basin surface water derived from both the organic and inorganic peat fractions. Anthropogenic activities (waste water effluents and rubbish dumps) increase Mn, P, B, and Br concentrations. Only Mn exceeds EC recommendations (50 mug/l) in some places. There is also a slight increase in Na+ and Cl- contents. Improving measures in the management of point pollution sources should be a priority to warrant the sustainable exploitation of water resources in the Drama basin.

AB Net ecosystem CO2 exchange was measured over a mountain birch forest in northern Finland throughout the growing season. The maximal net CO2 uptake rate of about - 0-5 mg(CO2) m(-2) s(-1) was observed at the end of July. The highest nocturnal respiration rates in early August were 0.2Mg(CO2)m(-2) s(-1). The daily CO2 balances during the time of maximal photosynthesis were about -159(CO2) m(-2) d(-1). The mountain birch forest acted as a net sink of CO2 from 30 June to 28 August. During that period the net CO2 balance was -448 g(CO2)m(-2). The interannual representativeness of the observed balances was studied using a simplified daily balance model, with daily mean global radiation and air temperature as the input parameters. The year-to-year variation in the phenological development was parameterised as a function of the cumulative effective temperature sum. The daily balance model was used for estimating the variability in the seasonal CO2 balances due to the timing of spring and meteorological factors. The sink term Of CO2 in 1996 was lower than the 15-year mean, mainly due to the relatively late emergence of the leaves.

AB Investigations were conducted with the aim to improve the energetic characterization of peats with different geological origin, hydrology, and botanical composition. Special attention was paid to the effects and kinetics of thermal treatment of peat decomposition in an oxidative atmosphere. Experiments were carried out using thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and a calorimetric bomb. The present study shows that thermal decomposition process consists in a devolatilization step between 473 and 650 K and a combustion step between 650 and 773 K. Thermochemical properties (i.e., degree of decomposition, ultimate analysis, and heating value) were determined for each sample and correlated to thermal behavior. Based on the experimental results, the kinetic parameters for pyrolysis and combustion of boreal peat were estimated using a three-step model. The kinetic triplet of each reaction was estimated using the hybrid kinetic method Cancellieri et al. (Thermochim Acta 438:41-50, 2005). These results will assist in the development of an energetic classification of peat fuels.

AB Paleohydrological changes during the late Holocene are inferred from humification, testate amoebae, and pollen evidence from three blanket peat profiles in northwest Scotland, Replicate peat humification records from the Traligill basin share the same patterns of change for a 600-yr period of overlap between 1800 and 2400 cal yr B.P. The shared patterns, inferred from samples with a resolution of 5-13 yr,represent basinwide hydrological changes. In a nearby, but hydrologically separate, area with caves beneath peat, the luminescence emission wavelength measured in two speleothem samples correlated with the humification record in the overlying peat, This correlation implies that speleothem luminescence emission wavelength depends primarily on decay rates in the soils from which drip waters are derived, as long as there is no major change in soil or vegetation. The peat and speleothem records from the cave site further correlate with the peat records from the Traligill basin. Taken together, the records thus represent a regional climatic signal. Peaks in surface wetness replicated in two or more records occur at ca, 2300, 2090, 2030, 1820, 1600, and 1440 cal yr B.P. Further peaks occur at 800, 570, and 115 cal yr B.P. in the humification and stalagmite records that extend to the present day. Correlative changes have been observed, not only in other peat records from Scotland but also in ice accumulation at GISP2, These further correlations imply that precipitation regimes in Scotland and Greenland were in phase during the late Holocene.

AB The paper reports the results of the organic petrological, palynological and geochemical characterization of lignite samples from the Kipra lignite seam (Late Miocene, Maritsa-West Basin, Bulgaria). The bulk of the organic matter (OM) is represented by highly gelified detrohuminite with locally abundant leaf-derived ulminite. Liptinite group is characterized by predominance of microsporinite and liptodetrinite, locally with cutinite and fluorinite. Terpene resinite and suberinite are rare. Low TPI and high GI indices indicate peat formation from vegetation with low preservation potential, deposited under water-logged environment of marsh- or fen-type. The palynological results reveal a vegetational community representing different habitats (i.e. mesophytic, marginal and aquatic). The relatively poor preservation of the palynomorphs, however, suggests vegetation that was more diverse during peat formation. Although gymnosperm palynomorphs predominate, the gymnosperm organic matter contribution was probably minor as indicated by the low contents of sesqui- and diterpenoid biomarkers. Because of the absence of triterpenoid biomarkers of neither oleanane, nor lupane or ursane-type, it is considered that angiosperms that do not synthesize their precursors predominated, or the depositional environment had unfavorable characteristics, which prevented the transformation of the triterpenoid precursors.
   The extractable organic matter yield from the Kipra lignite is low, and dominated by saturated compounds, while polar compounds and asphaltenes occur in low amounts. Aromatic compounds are completely absent. The saturated hydrocarbons are mainly composed of n-alkanes, accompanied by minor amounts of branched- (including isoprenoids) and cycloalkanes, sesqui- and diterpenoids, steroids and hopanoids. Straight chain alkanes are prevailed by long-chain homologues, but show rather mature distribution with CPI similar to 1. Biological (e.g. bacterial) activities and/or environmental control are considered as the main factor/s controlling the observed uncommon n-alkane distributions. A rather uncommon pentacyclic terpenoid, i.e. onocerane I, was tentatively identified in one sample, based on its characteristic fragmentation pattern. Based on its presence, a very specific plant community is considered, and/or specific palaeoenvironmental conditions occurred at least temporarily during the peat formation. However, the responsible plants could not be identified. The low amounts of hopanoid biomarkers, together with the low amounts of n-alkanones, are consistent with limited aerobic biodegradation of the plant remains. The mature 22S/(22S + 22R) C-30 hopane ratio (similar to 0.55), as well as the random huminite reflectance values (similar to 0.3-0.4%), which are more than twice higher than previously reported, argue for a local increase of coalification degree, presumably due to increased thermal influx around major faults.

AB Arctic tundra ecosystems are currently facing amplified rates of climate warming. Since these ecosystems store significant amounts of soil organic carbon, which can be mineralized to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), rising temperatures may cause increasing greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere. To understand how net the ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 will respond to changing climatic and environmental conditions, it is necessary to understand the individual responses of the processes contributing to NEE. Therefore, this study aimed to partition NEE at the soil-plant-atmosphere interface in an arctic tundra ecosystem and to identify the main environmental drivers of these fluxes. NEE was partitioned into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and further into autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic respiration (R-H). The study examined CO2 flux data collected during the growing season in 2015 using closed-chamber measurements in a polygonal tundra landscape in the Lena River Delta, northeastern Siberia. To capture the influence of soil hydrology on CO2 fluxes, measurements were conducted at a water-saturated polygon center and a well-drained polygon rim. These chamber-measured fluxes were used to model NEE, GPP, R-eco, R-H, R-A, and net primary production (NPP) at the pedon scale (1-10 m) and to determine cumulative growing season fluxes. Here, the response of in situ measured R-A and R-H fluxes from permafrost-affected soils of the polygonal tundra to hydrological conditions have been examined. Although changes in the water table depth at the polygon center sites did not affect CO2 fluxes from R-H, rising water tables were linked to reduced CO2 fluxes from R-A. Furthermore, this work found the polygonal tundra in the Lena River Delta to be a net sink for atmospheric CO2 during the growing season. The NEE at the wet, depressed polygon center was more than twice that at the drier polygon rim. These differences between the two sites were caused by higher GPP fluxes due to a higher vascular plant density and lower R-eco fluxes due to oxygen limitation under water-saturated conditions at the polygon center in comparison to the rim. Hence, soil hydrological conditions were one of the key drivers for the different CO2 fluxes across this highly heterogeneous tundra landscape.

AB The organic mattermineral complex plays an important role in regulating the fate of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in the environment. In the present study, the authors investigated the microbial bioavailability of phenanthrene (PHE) sorbed on the original and demineralized humic acids (HAs) and humin (HM) that were sequentially extracted from a peat soil. Demineralization treatment dramatically decreased the 720-h mineralized percentage of HM-sorbed PHE from 42.5 +/- 2.6% to 3.4 +/- 1.3%, whereas the influence of this treatment on the biodegradability of HA-associated PHE was much lower. Degradation kinetics of HA- and HM-sorbed PHE showed that its initial degradation rate was negatively correlated with the aromatic carbon content of humic substances (p?<?0.05). This was attributed to the strong interactions between PHE and the aromatic components of humic substances, which hampered its release and subsequent biodegradation. The 720-h mineralized percentage of PHE was inversely correlated with the estimated thickness of the organic matter layer at the surfaces of HAs and HMs. Therefore, in a relatively long term, diffusion of PHE within the organic matter layer could be an important factor that may limit the bioavailability of PHE to bacteria. Results of the present study highlight the molecular-scaled mechanisms governing bioavailability of PHE sorbed on humic substances. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012; 31: 14311437. (C) 2012 SETAC

AB Large intact moorland oligotrophic peat microcosms, complete with associated Calluna vulgaris- or mixed grass-dominated vegetation, have been subjected to realistically simulated precipitation with or without enhanced N. The control 'rainfall' solute composition was appropriate for the site of microcosm collection. In addition, N treatments were applied by adding to this basic mixture two or six times the ambient N deposition for the site, as either (NH4)(2)SO4 or HNO3. For both Calluna-dominated and grass-dominated microcosms, the treatments over 12 months resulted in significant falls in peat C:N ratio, associated with substantial increases in exchangeable NH4+. The accumulation of NH4+-N in peat was greater under Calluna than under grass for all N treatments. Peat KCl-extractable NH4+ concentration increased significantly with increasing (NH4)(2)SO4 treatments under both types of vegetation. However, peat total N concentration was only increased significantly by both NH4+ treatments under Calluna and by the highest NH4+ treatment under grass. The results show that peat-based ecosystems respond rapidly to enhanced N deposition, with NH4+-N deposition resulting in greater soil N accumulation than the corresponding amount of NO3--N deposition.

ID WATER; INFILTRATION; TRANSMISSION; SHAPE
AB A key parameter used in wetland hydrological and landform development models is hydraulic conductivity. Head recovery tests are often used to measure hydraulic conductivity, but the calculation techniques are usually confined to rigid soil theory. This is despite reports demonstrating the misapplication of rigid soil theory to non-rigid soils such as peals. Although values of hydraulic conductivity calculated using compressible techniques have been presented for fenland peals, these data have never, to the authors' knowledge, been compared with such calculations in other peat types. Head recovery tests (slug withdrawal) were performed on piezometers at depths ranging from 10 to 80 cm from the surface on north Pennines blanket peals. Results were obtained using both rigid and compressible soil theories, thus allowing comparison of the two techniques. Compressible soil theory gives values for hydraulic conductivity that are typically a factor of five times less than rigid soil calculations. Hydraulic conductivity is often assumed to decrease with depth in upland peats, but at the study site in the northern Pennines it was not found to vary significantly with depth within the range of peat depths sampled. The variance within depth categories was not significantly different to the variance between depth categories showing that individual peat layers did not have characteristic hydraulic conductivity values. Thus, large lateral and vertical differences in hydraulic conductivity over short distances create problems for modelling but may help account for the high frequency of preferential flow pathways within what is otherwise a low matrix hydraulic conductivity peat. Hydraulic conductivity was found to vary significantly between sampling sites, demonstrating that hillslope- or catchment-scale variability may be more important than plot-scale variability. Values for compressibility of the peats are also reported. These generally decline with depth, and they also vary significantly between sampling sites. There are implications for the way in which measurements of hydraulic conductivity and other properties of blanket peat are interpreted, as the effects of environmental change in one part of a peat catchment may be very different to those in another.

AB Many antibiotics, including sulfonamides, are being frequently detected in soil and groundwater. Livestock waste is an important source of antibiotic pollution, and sulfonamides may be present along with organic-rich substances. This study aims to investigate the sorption reaction of two sulfonamides, sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and sulfapyridine (SPY) in two organic-rich sorbents: a commercial peat soil (38.41% carbon content) and a composted manure (24.33% carbon content). Batch reactions were conducted to evaluate the impacts of pH (4.5-9.5) and background ions (0.001 M-0.1 M CaCl2) on their sorption. Both linear partitioning and Freundlich sorption isotherms fit the reaction well. The n values of Freundlich isotherm were close to 1 in most conditions suggesting that the hydrophobic partition is the major adsorption mechanism. In terms of SMZ, K-d declined with increases in the pH. SPY has a pyridine group that is responsible for adsorption at high pH values, and thus, no significant trend between Kd and pH was observed. At high pH ranges, SPY sorption deviated significantly from linear partitioning. The results suggested the sorption mechanism of these two sulfonamide antibiotics tended to be hydrophobic partitioning under most of the experimental conditions, especially at pH values lower than their corresponding pK(a2), The fluorescence excitation emission matrix and dissolved organic carbon leaching test suggested composted manure has higher fulvic acid organics and that peat soil has higher humus like organics. Small organic molecules showed stronger affinity toward sulfonamide antibiotics and cause the composted manure to exhibit higher sorption capacity. Overall, this study suggests that the chemical structure and properties of sulfonamides antibiotics and the type of organic matter in soils will greatly influence the fate and transport of these contaminants into the environment.

AB Global warming is anticipated to have a significant impact on high-latitude ecosystems which store large amounts of C in their soils and have a predominance of permafrost. The purpose of this study was to estimate the total C storage of different ecosystems along a north-south transect in Alaska. Soil pedons from three Alaska climate zones were studied. These zones were the arctic slope with continuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly tussock tundra and coastal marsh, Interior Alaska with discontinuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly spruce forest on the upland and tundra or bog in the lowland, and Southern Alaska free of permafrost with the vegetation predominantly mixed hardwood and conifers with moss bogs.
   Soil samples were taken from the representative ecosystems of these zones for carbon storage analysis. In the Arctic and Interior Alaska zones, many soils are cryoturbated and as a result the horizons are warped and often broken. These conditions made it impractical to use the common method for estimating C storage that is used for soils with roughly parallel horizons. For this study the linear proportion of each horizon in the cryoturbated pedon was digitized by using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the irregular horizons were collapsed to form a simulated profile with parallel horizons. The carbon content of each pedon was then calculated based on the linear proportions. These carbon stores based on the whole soil (1 m deep) approach were compared to other available estimates from the literature.
   Calculations for pedons from selected ecosystems in Alaska ranged from 169 MgC/ha to 1292 MgC/ha. The organic carbon storage of the arctic coastal marsh pedon amounted to 692 MgC/ha, and that of the arctic tundra pedon amounted to 314 and 599 MgC/ha. The carbon storage of interior forest pedons was 169 and 787 MgC/ha, and the associated organic soil stored nearly 1300 MgC/ha. The carbon storage in the mixed forest and coastal forest pedons was 240 and 437 MgC/ha, respectively. The bog associated with the mixed and coastal forest stored 1260 MgC/ha. Soils with the thickest organic layers were bogs associated with the tundra and boreal forest. These soils had the largest carbon storage. Carbon stores estimated from the whole pedon approach are 30 to 100% higher than those from the literature from the same zones. These data suggest that the global carbon storage estimates based in part on literature values from the N. latitudes, may be underestimated.

AB Arctic permafrost soils contain large amounts of organic carbon and the pollutant mercury (Hg). Arctic warming and associated changes in hydrology, biogeochemistry and ecology risk mobilizing soil Hg to rivers and to the Arctic Ocean, yet little is known about the quantity, timing and mechanisms involved. Here we investigate seasonal particulate Hg (PHg) and organic carbon (POC) export in 32 small and medium rivers across a 1700 km latitudinal permafrost transect of the western Siberian Lowland. The PHg concentrations in suspended matter increased with decreasing watershed size. This underlines the significance of POC-rich small streams and wetlands in PHg export from watersheds. Maximum PHg concentrations and export fluxes were located in rivers at the beginning of permafrost zone (sporadic permafrost). We suggest this reflects enhanced Hg mobilization at the permafrost boundary, due to maximal depth of the thawed peat layer. Both the thickness of the active (unfrozen) peat layer and PHg run-off progressively move to the north during the summer and fall seasons, thus leading to maximal PHg export at the sporadic to discontinuous permafrost zone. The discharge-weighed PHg:POC ratio in western Siberian rivers (2.7 +/- 0.5 mu g Hg: g C) extrapolated to the whole Ob River basin yields a PHg flux of 1.5 +/- 0.3 Mg y(-1), consistent with previous estimates. For current climate warming and permafrost thaw scenarios in western Siberia, we predict that a northward shift of permafrost boundaries and increase of active layer depth may enhance the PHg export by small rivers to the Arctic Ocean by a factor of two over the next 10-50 years.

AB Within the framework of the European Land Arctic Physical Processes project and as part of the Danish Research Council's Polar Program, a study on trace gas exchange in a high-arctic ecosystem was conducted in NE Greenland, May-August 1997. On the basis of carbon dioxide flux measurements from three dominant surface types, this paper reports on the upscaling of such measurements from canopy to landscape level. Over a three-week period starting in mid-July, the different surfaces revealed large differences in the CO2 flux with uptake rates ranging from 0.7 g C m(-2) d(-1) over the dwarf shrub heath to 3.0 g C m(2) d(-1) over denser parts of the fen, while willow snowbed revealed intermediate uptake rates. The carbon dioxide exchange could be simulated by a CO2 model, combining photosynthesis and soil respiration routines, for which the parametrization depended on the vegetation type. Results from the simulation were supported by a sensitivity analysis based on a three-dimensional footprint model where it was shown that the CO2 uptake was strongly related to the measured leaf area index. The CO2 model was used to calculate the spatial distribution in Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) on the basis of Landsat satellite data acquired at the peak of the growing season and stratified according to vegetation type. It was found that there was a reasonable agreement between the satellite-based flux estimate (-0.77 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and the CO2 flux found by areal weighting of the eddy correlation measurements (-0.88 g C m(-2) d(-1)) for Me specific study day. Finally, the summer season NEE was calculated for the whole Zackenberg Valley bottom. In June, there was a valley-wide carbon loss of 8.4+/-2.6 g C m(-2) month(-1), whereas the valley system accumulated 18.8+/-6.7 g C m(-2) season(-1) during the growing season (July-August).

AB Stand productivity of the dominant macrophyte Typha latifolia may be constrained by salinity and pollution in the oil sands wetlands of northern Alberta. We compared the performance and stand biomass of T. latifolia plants established in oil sands industrial wetlands (directly exposed to byproduct processed materials), on-site indirectly-affected, and off-site natural wetlands. We studied T. latifolia physiology (gas exchange, leaf fluorescence), morphology, leaf chemistry, and stand biomass. Oil sands plants had lower stomatal conductance than plants in natural wetlands resulting in lower transpiration but unaffected net photosynthesis rates. Oil sands plants had smaller and lower numbers of green leaves than natural wetlands plants. T. latifolia stands established in oil sands wetlands had lower aboveground and total biomass compared to natural wetlands. Despite water chemistry differences, T. latifolia plant performance did not differ between oil sands wetlands types. However, there was a lower total stand biomass in industrial than in indirectly-affected wetlands. T. latifolia had an unaltered photosynthetic activity in the oil sands wetlands allowing for the maintenance of persistent plant stands. However, T. latifolia growth restrictions and a lower stand biomass in the oil sands wetlands probably compromise long-term reclamation objectives focused on the accumulation of organic sediment and peat.

AB Studies of the chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols, rain water and snow in various regions of the globe quite often show the presence of pyridine and a number of its low mass derivatives. Nevertheless, the sources of those compounds in the environment have not yet been established and definitely require elucidation, supported by reliable experimental results. In the present work the chemical composition of peat combustion products as one of the important sources of atmospheric aerosol emission is studied by two-dimensional gas chromatography - high-resolution mass spectrometry with a focus on the detection of pyridine derivatives. Twenty-five compounds of this class were reliably identified and quantified in laboratory experiments on peat burning. Among them 3-hydroxypyridine predominates, while the rest analytes are mostly represented by alkyl derivatives: pyridine, 2-methylpyridine, 3-methylpyridine, 2,5-dimethylpyridine, 2,6-dimethylpyridine, 2-ethylpyridine, lutidines (in order of decreasing concentration). The distribution of these combustion products coincides with that obtained earlier in environmental studies carried out in Arctic, Central Russia and France. The experiments on peat thermal decomposition by pyrolysis GC-MS demonstrated that the maximum concentrations as well as the number of detected analytes were found under conditions of oxygen lack and a temperature of about 500 degrees C, i.e. characteristic conditions of peat wildfires. The observed levels of pyridines' emission recalculated on the peat dry weight exceeded 200 mg kg(-1). Considering hundreds of millions tons of peat burning in megafires over 20,000 tons of pyridines penetrate the Earth atmosphere annually. The obtained results allow concluding that peat burning may be the major and still underestimated source of pyridine and lower alkylpyridines in the Earth atmosphere. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper summarizes an evaluation of practicability of rural countermeasures after radioactive fallout in northern conditions carried out by a Finnish group of experts in the FARMING Network project. Snow and soil frost limit the selection of crops, and the short growing season allows mostly one harvest yearly. Cold climate restricts fruit production to apples and berries. Due to the long indoor feeding period, conserved and stored clean feed is available almost all year round. The use of fertilisers and lime on poor and acidic soils leads to high potassium and calcium intake of cows increasing the incidence of milk fever. The surface soil layer is thin and ploughing deeper than 20 cm is problematic due to stony and compacted soils. It also increases soil acidity and decreases fertility. Cultivation of peatlands limits the selection of plants and increases long-term radiocaesium contamination of crops. Frost and snow delay ploughing and spreading of waste milk on arable land, but removal of snow is a decontamination option. Long distances and high transport costs complicate carrying out the countermeasures. The Finnish stakeholder group considered it vital to be prepared for implementation of practicable measures for the safety of food. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increases in ground temperature make soil organic carbon in permafrost environments highly vulnerable to release to the atmosphere. High-centred polygonal terrain is a form of patterned ground that may act as a large source of carbon to the atmosphere because thawing ice wedges can result in increased ground temperatures, soil moisture, and thaw depth. To evaluate the effect of ice wedge degradation on carbon flux, carbon emissions were characterized at two polygonal peatlands in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands in northern Canada. Opaque chambers were used to measure CO2 and CH4 emissions from nine nondegraded polygon centres and nine moderately degraded troughs four times during the growing season. To measure emissions from 10 ponds resulting from severe ice wedge degradation, wind diffusion models were used to characterize fluxes using CO2 and CH4 concentration measurements made in each pond. Our field data show that degraded troughs had increased ground temperature, deeper active layers, and increased CO2 and CH4 emissions. Our study shows that rates of CO2 and CH4 emissions from high-centreed polygonal terrain are likely to increase with more widespread melt pond formation in this terrain type.

AB Tropical wetlands are typically productive ecosystems that can introduce large amounts of carbon into the soil. However, high temperatures and seasonal water availability can hinder the ability of wetland soils to sequester carbon efficiently. We determined the carbon sequestration rate of 12 wetland communities in four different tropical wetlands-an isolated depressional wetland in a rainforest, and a slow flowing rainforest swamp, a riverine flow-through wetland with a marked wet and dry season, a seasonal floodplain of an inland delta-with the intention of finding conditions that favor soil carbon accumulation in tropical wetlands. Triplicate soil cores were extracted in these communities and analyzed for total carbon content to determine the wetland soil carbon pool. We found that the humid tropic wetlands had greater carbon content (P a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) than the tropical dry ones (96.5 and 34.8 g C kg(-1), respectively). While the dry tropic wetlands had similar sequestration rates (63 +/- A 10 g Cm-2 y(-1) on average), the humid tropic ones differed significantly (P < 0.001), with high rates in a slow-flowing slough (306 +/- A 77 g Cm-2 y(-1)) and low rates in a tropical rain forest depressional wetland (84 +/- A 23 g Cm-2 y(-1)). The carbon accumulating in all of these wetlands was mostly organic (92-100%). These results suggest the importance of differentiating between types of wetland communities and their hydrology when estimating overall rates at which tropical wetlands sequester carbon, and the need to include tropical wetland carbon sequestration in global carbon budgets.

AB Quantification of activity data and emission factors for carbon (C) in inland wetland mineral soils (IWMS) lack suitable low cost indicators for key soil C processes in temperate forests. In a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest near Soro, Denmark, SOC stocks and the risk of losing pre-drainage legacy SOC were studied using a digital elevation model (0.4 m resolution), redox potential and soil respiration measurements. The results were compared with a digitized legacy soil map used in the national GHG reporting to UNFCCC. In upland, flat and sloping terrain, an aerobic soil environment (Eh > 400 mV) prevailed throughout most of the year, but in a peat-filled topographic depression (TD) anaerobic conditions (Eh < 400 mV) fully or sporadically occurred in the growing season, controlled by the ditching-affected water table. The relief included SOC rich TDs making up 18.9% of the area based on the "Filled sink" algorithm (Saga GIS). In contrast, the peat cover on the legacy soil map was 8.2%. Furthermore, the mapped peat polygons were offset from the TDs defined by the DEM. The SOC stocks at 0-40 cm depth outside TDs (least squares mean 8.4 +/- sem 0.3 kg C m(-2)) were significantly lower than within TDs (11.9 +/- sem 0.5 kg C m(-2)). Average annual soil respiration increased linearly with the SOC stock by 0.06 kg C per kg SOC up to a SOC stock of 11 kg C m(-2) to 20 cm depth, and a SOC loss of 0.23 +/- se 0.10 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) was indicated inside the TD areas, close to the IPCC estimate of 0.26 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) for drained organic soils under forest. Our results show that continuous sensor-based monitoring of redox potential and shallow water tables linked with high-resolution DEMs offer the possibility to estimate the spatial extent of inland wetland mineral soils and their status as aerobic or anaerobic as indicated by iron rods with higher accuracy than previously. This underpins the potential use of such data for activity data mapping in Tier 3 greenhouse gas reporting.

AB Background: An insight into the molecular composition of ombrotrophic peats of different geographical origin and collected at different depths was achieved by the humeomics method. The humeomic fractionation allowed the separation of molecular components in either organic solvents or water on the basis of their progressive binding strength to the humic matrix. The solubilized matter in fractions was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy, while the residues depleted of the extracted material were observed by C-13 cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13-CPMAS-NMR) spectroscopy.
   Results The analytical characterization of fractions and residues differentiated peats not only on the basis of the different classes of extracted molecules, but also on their binding strength to the complex peat matrix. Aromatic, lipidic, and sugar compounds were the most representative molecular classes extracted in the humeomic fractions and their abundance varied with depth. The distribution and abundance of extracted compounds provided an indication of the extent of organic matter accumulation in peat. The NMR spectra of solid residues supported the interpretation of the characteristics of the various extracts.
   Conclusions Our findings proved that the humeomic approach allows to provide important information on both the molecular composition of peats and its variation with depth.

AB The peat profile in the Ohnohara wetland in Central Japan is very valuable due to the continuous accumulation of peat since even before the last glacial maximum era. Using this profile, we investigated the environmental and climatic changes which occurred since the last glacial era based on the determination of the contents and composition of phenolic compounds released from peat by CuO oxidation. For describing the changes in the anaerobic/aerobic conditions in the wetland, the phenolic degradation products were grouped into phenolic acids, acetophenones, cinnamic acids, and phenolic aldehydes. The changes in the ratios between cinnamyl, vanillyl, syringyl, and p-hydroxyphenyl compounds as well as the ratio of ferulic acid/p-coumaric acid corresponded well to the changes in the vegetation type of the wetland. Phenolic compounds released from the peal samples corresponded A-ell to the observations based on palynological studies and to the data relating to post-glacial climatic changes. Therefore, it is suggested that the contents and composition of phenolic compounds of peat could be used as an index of the changes in paleo-environments.

AB A common lycopsid genus, Sigillaria Brongniart, has been recorded most frequently in peat-forming forests in Europe and North America, but rarely in China. Although Sigillaria, in China, has been found in coal balls and used as evidence that it was a coal-forming element, it has never been recorded as compression/impressions in peat-forming settings. Recent investigation of an Early Permian autochthonous peat-forming flora of the Taiyuan Formation near Wuda, Inner Mongolia, has provided evidence that Sigillaria Could be a major element of peat-forming vegetation in China. Sigillaria is the only arborescent lycopsid acting as a major contributor to peat/coal formation. The genus Sigillaria is another element that China has in common with the Palaeozoic low-land floras of Europe and North America, enhancing the common floral aspects between the tropical swamp vegetations of the east and west regions of the Palaeotethys Ocean.

AB Data from a transect of four cores collected in the Makepeace Cedar Swamp, near Carver, Massachusetts, record past changes in deposition, vegetation, and water level. Time series of palynological data provide a 14,000-yr record of regional and local vegetation development, a means for biostratigraphic correlation and dating, and information about changes in water level. Differences in records among cores in the basin show that water level decreased at least 1.5 m between similar to 10,800 and 9700 cal yr B,P., after which sediment accumulation was slow and intermittent across the basin for about 1700 yr. Between 8000 and 5600 cal yr B.P,, water level rose similar to 2.0 m, after which slow peat accumulation indicates a low stand about the time of the hemlock decline at 5300 +/- 200 cal yr B.P, Dry conditions may have continued after this time, but by 3200 cal yr B.P., the onset of peat accumulation in shallow cores indicates that water level had risen to close to its highest postglacial level, where it is today, Feat has accumulated across the whole basin since 3200 cal yr B,P, Data from Makepeace and the Pequot Cedar Swamp, near Ledyard, Connecticut, indicate an early Holocene dry interval in southern New England that began 11,500 yr ago near the end of the Younger Dryas interval. The dry conditions prevailed between 10,800 and 8000 cal yr B,P, and coincide with the arrival and later rise to dominance of white pine trees (Pinus strobus) both regionally and near the basins. Our results indicate a climatic cause for the "pine period" in New England. (C) 2000 University of Washington.

TI Biomass allocation in Late Pennsylvanian coal-swamp plants
SO PALAIOS
LA English
DT Article
ID EURAMERICA; FROND; BASIN
AB Carbon allocation to different tissues and organs of Late Pennsylvanian-aged coal-swamp plants was determined for the first time through study of coal balls from the Calhoun coal of central Illinois. Coal balls are concretions that preserve the original peat fabric of the coal seam; they occur within the coal matrix and generally are permineralized with calcium carbonate. Coalified plant cell walls are preserved within the mineral matrix of the coal ball, entombed within the calcium carbonate. Relative carbon allocation was determined by separation of the mineral matrix and organic carbon. Carbon content was determined for replicates of tissues or organs of Psaronius tree ferns, Medullosa pteridosperms, the lycopsid Sigillaria approximata, the small fern Botryopteris forensis, and ''whole peat''. Unit volume results for tissues and organs were normalized for trunk sections 45 cm in diameter and 1 m long. Psaronius tree ferns were significantly ''cheaper'' than all other plants due to the large mantle of aerenchymatous roots that made up the bulk of the trunk. Medullosans and small ferns were most ''expensive'', with the arborescent lycopsid in between. Relative expense of construction closely parallels the inferred ecological role of each plant within ancient coal swamps, deduced from distributional patterns and indicators of habitat conditions. Tree ferns and lycopsids are colonists, medullosans are site occupying forms.

AB Agrochemicals and plastics represent a burden on natural ecosystems and there is an urgent need to introduce alternative plant protection measures that have fewer negative impacts on the environment. Replacement of plastic mulches and synthetic pesticides with their biodegradable alternatives offers a way to decrease chemical residues. Pyrolysis liquids (PL) have been suggested as easily degradable and residue-free herbicides for agriculture. We tested the efficiency of PL (1%-10% of volume) containing peat mulch (PLM) in weed control under glasshouse and field conditions. We also estimated the length of the withdrawal period needed between PLM spreading and sowing/planting for crops and examined the light permeability and effects of PLM on soil temperature. In the glasshouse, the mulch amended with 5%-10% PL inhibited weed germination entirely. In the agricultural field, the number of weeds remained 44%-60% lower under PLM than under the control mulch. In a study performed in a city park, weed cover around the base of trees remained 64%-85% lower under PLM than without a mulch. However, a 7-21 d withdrawal period, depending on crop plant species, is needed to avoid injuring the crops. PLM inhibited sunlight effectively and the effects on soil heat sum across the growing season remained small. The weed-inhibiting effect of PLM is probably a result of both the PL compounds and the solid cover, formed by the sticky PL and peat fibres, which acts as a mechanical barrier. We conclude that the PLM is a promising alternative to plastic mulches.

AB Arctic peat soils contain vast reserves of organic C and are largely anaerobic. However, anaerobic respiration, particularly the role of Fe(III) and humic substances as electron acceptors, is not well understood in such ecosystems. We investigated these processes in a drained thaw lake basin on the Arctic coastal plain near Barrow, Alaska. We measured concentrations of soluble Fe and other potential electron acceptors, described the microbial community, and performed experiments in the laboratory and field to measure net rates of Fe(III) reduction and the relationship of this process to C cycling. In most areas within the basin, aerobic conditions existed only in the upper few centimeters of soil, though oxygen penetrated deeper in raised areas, such as rims of ice wedge polygons. Concentrations of nitrate and sulfate in soil pore water were low or negligible. Soil pore water contained surprisingly high concentrations of Fe(II) and Fe(III), in the range of hundreds of mu M, suggesting the presence of organic chelators. The solid phase contained substantial amounts of iron minerals, with a progressively reduced oxidation state throughout the growing season. The most abundant 16S rRNA sequence in our gene survey was closely related to the Fe(III)-reducing bacterium, Rhodoferax ferrireducens, and other sequences closely related to Fe-transforming bacteria were found. Field and laboratory incubations with soluble Fe(III) and the quinonic compound, AQDS (a common humic analog), stimulated respiration and verified that Fe(III) reduction occurs in these soils. We conclude that reduction of Fe(III) and humic substances are major metabolic pathways in this ecosystem.

AB Tierra del Fuego is subject to increases in solar UV-B radiation in the austral spring and summer due to ozone depletion.
   Plastic films were used to filter solar UV-B radiation over peatland plots through six field seasons, resulting in near-ambient (c. 90%) and reduced (c. 17%) solar UV-B treatments.
   As in the first three field seasons of treatments, near-ambient UV-B caused reduced height growth but had no effect on biomass production of the moss Sphagnum magellanicum. it reduced leaf and rhizome growth of Tetroncium magellanicum. Height growth and morphology of Empetrum rubrum and Nothofagus antarctica were only affected by solar UV-B during the fourth to sixth field seasons. There was also a decrease in Tetroncium leaf nitrogen under near-ambient UV-B.
   Growth of Sphagnum was less affected than that of most emergent vascular plants. This enabled the Sphagnum mat to engulf more Nothotagus, and limit the escape of Empetrum under near-ambient UV-B. Yet, differences in the response of species to solar UV-B were not expressed as changes in plant community composition.

AB Jatropha curcas has the ability to phytoextract high amounts of heavy metals during its first months just after seeding. Notwithstanding, there is scarce information about metal uptake by adult J. curcas plants. To shed light on this issue, 4-year-old J. curcas L. plants were planted in a soil mixture of peat moss and mining soil (high metals content), and the biomass growth and metal absorption during 90 days were compared with those of plants growing in peat moss. The main metal found in the mining soil was Fe (31985 mg kg(-1)) along with high amounts of As (23717 mg kg 1). After the 90-day phytoremediation, the plant removed 29% of Fe and 44% of As from the soil mixture. Results revealed that J. curcas L. translocated high amounts of metals to its aerial parts, so that translocation factors were much higher than 1. Because of the high translocation and bioaccumulation factors obtained, J. curcas L. can be regarded as a hyperaccumulator plant. Despite the great capacity of J. curcas L. to phytoremediate heavy-metal-contaminated soils, the main drawback is the subsequent handling of the metal-contaminated biomass, although some potential applications have been recently highlighted for this biomass.

ID HUMIC MATERIALS; SORPTION; POLLUTANTS
AB The sorption at room temperature of benzene and carbon tetrachloride from water on three high-organic-content soils (muck, peat, and extracted peat) and on cellulose was determined in order to evaluate the effect of sorbent polarity on the solute partition coefficients.  The isotherms are highly linear for both solutes on all the organic matter samples, which is consistent with a partition model.  For both solutes, the extracted peat shows the greatest sorption capacity while the cellulose shows the lowest capacity; the difference correlates with the polar-to-nonpolar group ratio [(O + N)/C] of the sorbent samples.  The relative increase of solute partition coefficient (K(om)) with a decrease of sample polar content is similar for both solutes, and the limiting sorption capacity on a given organic matter sample is comparable between the solutes.  This observation suggests that one can estimate the polarity effect of a sample of soil organic matter (SOM) on K(om) of various nonpolar solutes by determining the partition coefficient of single nonpolar solute when compositional analysis of the SOM is not available.  The observed dependence of K(om) on sample polarity is used to account for the variation of K(om) values of individual compounds on different soils that results from change in the polar group content of SOM.  On the assumption that the carbon content of SOM in "ordinary soils" is 53-63%, the calculated variation of K(om) is a factor of approximately 3.  This value is in agreement with the limit of variation of most K(om) data with soils of relatively high SOM contents.

AB Pythium root and stem rots cause problems in production of greenhouse and nursery crops. Composts, however, can provide biological control of these diseases. We planted and germinated cucumber (Cucumis sativus 'Straight Eight') seeds in compost-amended (spruce or pine bark composts) or in highly decomposed sphagnum peat (H-4 on the von Post decomposition scale) mixes suppressive and conducive to Pythium root rot, respectively. Two-week-old seedlings were transplanted, using the split-root technique, into the compost-amended mixes and the peat mix. Split-root pairings were peat/compost, peat/peat, and compost/compost. Only one side of the split roots was grown in potting mix infested with Pythium ultimum and P. aphanidermatum. Root rot in the infested mix, averaged across all spit-root pairings, was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) less severe and mean root dry weights were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) higher in plants germinated in the compost-amended mixes than in the peat mix. Also, root rot in the infested pear mix was significantly less severe on roots paired with the compost-amended mixes than those paired with the peat mix. Plants grown from seed in the compost-amended mixes or the peat mix also were tested for resistance to anthracnose. Three weeks after planting, anthracnose on the second leaf of cucumber 'Straight Eight' inoculated with Colletotrichum orbiculare was significantly less severe (P less than or equal to 0.05) on plants grown in the compost-amended mixes than in the peat mix. Peroxidase activity, a putative marker of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in cucumber, was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) enhanced in plants grown in the compost-amended mixes compared to the peat mix. However, the activity of a peroxidase isozyme in the second leaf of cucumber plants was greater when plants were grown in compost as well as after prior inoculation with C. orbiculare than if grown in peat and with or without prior inoculation. The interaction of compost and the pathogen appeared critical for rapid activation of SAR-associated gene expression in cucumber plants.

AB The Late-glacial and Holocene environmental history of the Gordano Valley, North Somerset, UK has been reconstructed using pollen, sediment particle size and mineralogical analyses and radiocarbon dating. A Devensian sediment ridge across the valley confined the waters of a small lake, within which the initial sedimentation was minerogenic. Radiocarbon dating of overlying organic-rich deposits suggests that this began late in the Dimlington Stadial c. 18,000-15,000 Cal. BP. Petrographic analyses indicate the minerogenic sediments were partly wind-blown in origin. Climatic amelioration during the Windermere Interstadial c. 15,000 Cal. BP encouraged a shift from minerogenic to biogenic sedimentation. A brief return to minerogenic sedimentation between c. 10,400 and c. 9,520 Cal. BP was followed by uninterrupted fen peat accumulation throughout the Holocene. The later minerogenic horizon appears to represent the Loch Lomond Stadial. Few stratigraphic sequences preserving the complete Devensian Late-glacial-Holocene transition exist in southwest Britain, making the sedimentary archive of the Gordano Valley valuable regionally for reconstructing Late-glacial climate change.

AB Uncertainties and difficulties surrounding laboratory strength testing of peat have caused the increasing reliance on in situ testing methods, which include T-bar and ball penetrometers, to determine the undrained strength of peat for design purposes. This paper presents the results of miniature full-flow penetrometer (T-bar and ball) tests on decomposed peat samples to provide a better understanding of the interpretation of the strength parameters in this material. The tests were conducted in a pressure chamber, in which miniature T-bar and ball penetrometer tests can be performed on peat samples consolidated under specific vertical effective stresses. Penetrometer bearing factors were derived experimentally using the monotonic penetration resistance and the undrained shear strength estimated from triaxial tests. The bearing factors, expressed as the penetration resistances normalised by the undrained shear strength data (obtained from triaxial tests) compare well with those derived from plasticity solutions. In addition, the remoulded strength parameters derived from penetrometer cyclic tests are comparable with those obtained from fall cone tests. The findings reported in this paper illustrate the capability of full-flow penetrometer tests to measure the undrained strength of peat.

AB Thermal characteristics and gas compositions during peat pyrolysis under helium atmosphere were investigated using the TG-FTIR-MS coupling technique. The majority of gas products were released during the decomposition temperature of 150-550 degrees C, resulting in about 60% mass loss of peat. The main gas species detected during 150-400 degrees C were CO2, CO, CH4, C2H6, HCOOH, CH3CH2COOH, C4H8 and CH2CHCHO. From 400 degrees C to 550 degrees C, some aromatic hydrocarbons were identified, including benzaldehyde, phenol, benzoic acid and toluene. The release of CO2, CO, CH4 and some aromatic hydrocarbons over 550 degrees C provided the evidence of char pyrolysis. A five-step pyrolysis scheme including water evaporation, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin degradation, and char pyrolysis was used to simulate peat decomposition process in inert atmosphere. The well agreement between the calculated and experimental curves indicated that major aliphatic gases were derived from hemicellulose and cellulose pyrolysis, while aromatic hydrocarbons were mainly from lignin and char pyrolysis. This work provides a deep insight into the utilization of peat for gaseous biofuels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A 45-day incubation experiment in laboratory was conducted to examine the effects of the carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) additions on carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from two alpine meadow soils sampled on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: one with acid pH and high organic carbon content (HM), and the other one with alkaline pH and low organic carbon content (CM). The concentrations of DOC, NO3--N, NH4+-N and DTN in soils were measured at the end of the incubation. Addition of C significantly increased soil CO2 and N2O emissions in both alpine meadow soils. No significant effect of P addition on CO2 and N2O emission was detected in both soils. Data analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between the cumulative CO2 emissions and the soil DOC concentration, and a significant negative correlation between the cumulative N2O emissions and soil NO3--N concentration. These results suggest that soil CO2 and N2O emission is directly linked to the availability of soil C, while P is not the limiting factor for soil microbial activity in alpine meadow soils.

TI A REVIEW AND REINTERPRETATION OF EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF
   VICTORIAN BROWN COAL
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID VEGETATION; LITHOTYPES; DEPOSIT; FACIES; PEAT; SEAM
AB The nature of the depositional environments which led to the formation of the very extensive Victorian Brown Coal deposits located in Southeastern Australia, has been the subject of numerous publications.  Previous publications on this subject have suggested that these coals were laid down in an extensive series of peat swamps similar to the Florida Everglades (U.S.A.).  One of the central premises of this depositional model has been that lithotype formation is dependent on the degree of inundation of the original peat-forming environment.  Specifically, it proposes an inverse relationship between the degree of inundation and the "lightness" (of colour) of the resulting lithotype, with the light and pale lithotypes being deposited in fully inundated environments.
   In this manuscript, the evidence on which this depositional model is based, and other data, from a variety of disciplines, relevant to the question of the nature of the depositional environments of these coals, is reviewed.  The resulting synthesis of data has led the present authors to conclude that previous depositional models cannot fully account for the observed chemical, physical and geological characteristics of these coals.
   Therefore, a new depositional model is proposed which seeks to account for these observed characteristics.  It is concluded by the present authors that deposition of these coals probably took place in an extensive and long-lived series of ombrogenous (raised or domed) forested peat swamps, structurally analogous to modern peat accumulations in SE Asia.
   Further it is suggested that lithotype formation is governed not by the degree of inundation of the original peat-forming environments, but rather by the degree of aerobic degradation experienced by the initial peat accumulations, with pale and light coals representing the products of the most severely degraded peats.

AB The regional variability in tundra and boreal carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes can be high, complicating efforts to quantify sink-source patterns across the entire region. Statistical models are increasingly used to predict (i.e., upscale) CO2 fluxes across large spatial domains, but the reliability of different modeling techniques, each with different specifications and assumptions, has not been assessed in detail. Here, we compile eddy covariance and chamber measurements of annual and growing season CO2 fluxes of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during 1990-2015 from 148 terrestrial high-latitude (i.e., tundra and boreal) sites to analyze the spatial patterns and drivers of CO2 fluxes and test the accuracy and uncertainty of different statistical models. CO2 fluxes were upscaled at relatively high spatial resolution (1 km(2)) across the high-latitude region using five commonly used statistical models and their ensemble, that is, the median of all five models, using climatic, vegetation, and soil predictors. We found the performance of machine learning and ensemble predictions to outperform traditional regression methods. We also found the predictive performance of NEE-focused models to be low, relative to models predicting GPP and ER. Our data compilation and ensemble predictions showed that CO2 sink strength was larger in the boreal biome (observed and predicted average annual NEE -46 and -29 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) compared to tundra (average annual NEE +10 and -2 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). This pattern was associated with large spatial variability, reflecting local heterogeneity in soil organic carbon stocks, climate, and vegetation productivity. The terrestrial ecosystem CO2 budget, estimated using the annual NEE ensemble prediction, suggests the high-latitude region was on average an annual CO2 sink during 1990-2015, although uncertainty remains high.

DE ORGANIC SOILS; RADIO CESIUM; TRANSLOCATION
ID FALLOUT
AB Caesium-134 chloride solution was injected into the surface of a peaty podzol at 3 cm depth with 5 cm spacing over a M2 at two upland sites, one of which had been fertilized and reseeded. The movement of radio caesium in the soil was subsequently followed by coring and/or taking out 10-cm square blocks at monthly intervals over a period of 2 years. There was very little movement of the caesium down the profile, with more than 95% remaining at the point of application. Lateral movement was also minimal. The caesium did not concentrate in the roots. Samples of herbage collected from the surface during the growing season showed a progressively decreasing concentration of caesium over the period. Total caesium removed in herbage amounted to 3.5 and 0.6% of the original present for the improved and unimproved soils, respectively.
   The extractability of the caesium from the Cs-134-amended peaty soil was compared with that from a low-ash peat which had been treated with the radionuclide for 2 months. Initially 1 M ammonium acetate (pH 7.2) extracted 30 and 56% of the Cs from 0-3 and 3-6 horizons of the improved peaty podzol, respectively. After 5 months only about 12 and 7% of the Cs was extracted by 1 M ammonium acetate and 4 and 1% by 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate from the 0-3 and 3-6 cm horizons, respectively. After 24 months 1 M ammonium acetate extracted 1.6 and 3.3% of the Cs from the 0-3 and 3-6 cm horizons, respectively. In contrast, the values for the peat after 2 months were 100 and 80% for 1 M ammonium acetate and 0.1 M pyrophosphate, respectively.

AB The objective of the study was to elucidate correlations between meadow plant species, the content of some biogenic elements in groundwater, sward harvesting frequency and the level of the groundwater table at the beginning and at the end of a growing season. An adequate choice of species grown in organic soil may be of particular significance for nutrient management and prevention of water eutrophication due to biogenic elements. A lysimeter experiment was conducted on peat-muck soil. The chemical composition of groundwater sampled underneath the rhizosphere of P. pratensis, Ph. pratense and L. perenne was assessed in several years. Two fixed levels of the groundwater table were maintained in the lysimeters: 50 and 90 cm below the ground surface. Grass was harvested three or five times during a growing season. The content of nitrate-nitrogen and ammonium-nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sodium and magnesium was determined in the analysed groundwater. The results showed significant variation in the mean (over the research period) content of selected mineral components (except for phosphate ions) in the piezometer water collected under the rhizosphere of specific grass species. The species L. perenne absorbed mineral components most effectively. The highest concentration of the majority of the components studied was found in water beneath the rhizosphere of P. pratensis. Significantly higher concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen (but not ammonium-nitrogen) and potassium were found in water in the springtime. The biogenic element content found in objects with a three-cut harvesting regime was lower than in waters underneath grasses harvested five times. Regardless of the species and harvesting frequency, a significantly higher content of specific cations and anions in piezometer water was found in objects with a lower level of the groundwater table.

AB As coastal wetlands subside worldwide, there is an urgency to understand the hydrologic drivers and dynamics of plant production and peat accretion. One incidental test of the effects of high rates of discharge on forested wetland production occurred in response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident, in which all diversions in Louisiana were operated at or near their maximum discharge level for an extended period to keep offshore oil from threatened coastal wetlands. Davis Pond Diversion was operated at six times the normal discharge levels for almost 4months, so that Taxodium distichum swamps downstream of the diversion experienced greater inundation and lower salinity. After this remediation event in 2010, above-ground litter production increased by 2.7 times of production levels in 2007-2011. Biomass of the leaf and reproductive tissues of several species increased; wood litter was minimal and did not change during this period. Root production decreased in 2010 but subsequently returned to pre-remediation values in 2011. Both litter and root production remained high in the second growing season after hydrologic remediation. Annual tree growth (circumference increment) was not significantly altered by the remediation. The potential of freshwater pulses for regulating tidal swamp production is further supported by observations of higher T.distichum growth in lower salinity and/or pulsed environments across the U.S. Gulf Coast. Usage of freshwater pulses to manage altered estuaries deserves further consideration, particularly because the timing and duration of such pulses could influence both primary production and peat accretion.

AB Plant growth forms are widely used to predict the effects of environmental changes, such as climate warming and increased nitrogen deposition, on plant communities, and the consequences of species shifts for carbon and nutrient cycling. We investigated whether the relationship between growth forms and patterns in litter quality and decomposition are independent of environmental conditions and whether growth forms are as good as litter chemistry at predicting decomposability.
   We used a natural, latitudinal gradient in NW Europe as a spatial analogue for future increases in temperature and nitrogen availability. Our screening of 70 species typical of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands showed that leaf litters of Sphagnum mosses, evergreen and deciduous shrubs, graminoids and forbs differed significantly in litter chemistry and that the ranking of the growth forms was independent of the region for all litter chemistry variables. Differences among growth forms were usually larger than differences related to the environmental gradient.
   After 8 and 20 months incubation in outdoor, Sphagnum-based decomposition beds, growth forms generally differed in decomposability, but these patterns varied with latitude. Sphagnum litters decomposed slower than other litters in all regions, again explaining its high representation in organic deposits of peatlands. Forb litters generally decomposed fastest, while the differences among the other growth forms were small, particularly at higher latitudes.
   Multiple regression analyses showed that growth forms were better at predicting leaf litter decomposition than chemical variables in warm-temperate peatlands with a high N-load, but less so in the subarctic, low-N region.
   Our results indicate that environmental changes may be less important in determining ecosystem leaf litter chemistry directly than are their indirect effects through changes in the relative abundance of growth forms. However, climatic and nutritional constraints in high-latitude peatlands promote convergence towards nutrient-efficient plant traits, resulting in similar decomposition rates of vascular growth forms despite differences in litter chemistry. The usefulness of the growth-form concept in predicting plant community controls on ecosystem functioning is therefore somewhat limited.

AB The wetlands play an important role in global carbon and nitrogen storage, and they are also natural sources of greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Land-use change is an important factor affecting the exchange of greenhouse gases between wetlands and the atmosphere. However, few studies have investigated the effect of land-Use change on CH4 and N2O emissions from freshwater marsh in China. Therefore, a field Study was carried out over a year to investigate the seasonal changes of the emissions of CH4 and N2O at three sites (Deyeuxia angustifolia marsh, dryland and rice field) in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. Marsh was the source of CH4 Showing a distinct temporal variation. Maximum fluxes occurred in June and the highest value was 20.69 +/- 2.57 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). The seasonal change of N2O fluxes from marsh was not obvious, consisted of a Series of emission Pulses. The marsh acted as a N2O sink during winter, while became a N2O source in the growing season. The results showed that gas exchange between soil/snow and the atmosphere in the winter season contributed greatly to the annual budgets. The winter season CH4 flux was about 3.24% of the annual flux and the winter uptake of N2O accounted for 13.70% of the growing-season emission. Conversion marsh to dryland resulted in a shift from a strong CH4 source to a weak sink (from 199.12 +/- 39.04 to -1.37 +/- 0.68 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1)), while increased N2O emissions somewhat(from 4.07 +/- 1.72 to 4.90 +/- 1.52 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1)). Conversion marsh to rice held significantly decreased CH4 emission from 199.12 +/- 39.04 to 94.82 +/- 9.86 kg CH4 ha(-1) yr(-1) and N2O emission from 4.07 +/- 1.72 to 2.09 +/- 0.79 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB We identified the effects of vegetation changes, and aerobic and anaerobic decay on the lignin composition in the Penido Vello peat record (Galicia, Spain). The ombrotrophic part of this peat record was dominated by graminoids and has significant contributions of ericoids at some depths. The organic matter (OM) of different peat fractions (bulk, NaOH-extractable fraction, and non-extractable residues) of 15 samples from the upper meter was analysed with pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC/MS). In addition, the dominant plant species were analysed, including Carex durieui, Agrostis curtisii, Molinia caerulea, Deschampsia flexuosa, Festuca rubra, Eriophorum angustifolium, Erica mackaiana and Calluna vulgaris, and their lignin composition compared to that of the peat OM. The high abundance of guaiacol and 4-formylguaiacol in fresh plant tissue compared to peat OM suggests that in addition to p-coumaric and ferulic acid (which are abundant in graminoids), other non-lignin phenolic monomers are contributed by graminoid species. For the non-lignin phenolics, graminoids differed from ericoids in the high abundance of ferulic acid (4-vinylguaiacol), while p-coumaric acid (4-vinylphenol) showed high and similar abundances in ericoids and graminoids. This result suggests that ratios between p-hydroxyphenyl (or p-coumaric acid) and other lignin moieties in (pyrolysates of) peat cannot be used as source indicator. Comparison of plant and peat fractions using factor analysis allowed a distinction between the effects of source (plant identity) and decay on the lignin composition of the Penido Vello peat, and different stages of decomposition were identified. Preferential decay of guaiacyl over syringyl moieties was found for the first stage of decay. This preferential decay is probably related to the large abundance of guaiacyl moieties in easily degradable non-lignin phenolics. Preferential decay of syringyl moieties occurred during subsequent aerobic decay. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A static, dark chamber technique was used weekly from mid-July to mid-November in 1995 and biweekly from mid-May to late November in 1996, to measure methane (CH4) flux and soil and plant community res ration of CO2 from 36 sites in two wetlands In Kejimkujik National Park in south-central Nova Scotia, Canada. Overall mean fluxes of CH4 were 43 mg m(-2) d(-1) in 1995 and 20 mg m(-2) d-1 in 1996. Respiration rates were 5.1 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1995 and 3.2 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1996. Fluxes of CH4 and CO2 were related to microtopography and ecological grouping, depth to water table, and air and peat temperatures. Edge and hummock sites showed the lowest CH4 flux and the highest respiration rate, while pools showed the highest CH4 and lowest respiration rate. Gas emissions displayed a strong seasonal pattern with highest values occurring during the summer (June to August) and with a marked reduction in late fall. Depth to water table and air temperature explained 34 to 43% of the variance in CH4 flux and respiration from the sites over the 2 years (n = 666 to 824). We developed algorithms relating the daily mean flux of CH4 and respiration from the wetlands to an aspatial soil moisture, water table, and temperature model (ForHyM2) applied to the wetland basins. We then applied this model to calculated May to October fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from 1966 to 1998. We estimated that CH4 fluxes ranged from 2.8 to 7.4 g m(-2) with a mean of 3.7 g m(-2) and a standard deviation of 1.2 g m(-2) over the 1966-1998 period. Respiration estimates ranged from 0.60 to 1.16 kg CO2 m(-2) with a mean of 0.74 kg CO2 m(-2) and a standard deviation of 0.11 kg CO2 m(-2). Application of a 2xCO(2) General Circulation Model scenario to temperature and precipitation for this part of eastern Canada resulted in increases of growing season CH4 emissions from 4.7 to 11.4 g m(-2) and respiration from 0.77 to 1.32 kg CO2 m(-2).

AB Sports fields constructed on sand-based root zones are generally permeable to water and nutrients, and potential contaminants of the groundwater. This study was conducted to determine the effect of slow-release and water-soluble fertilizers on growth, nutrient uptake and leaching from a sand-based Kentucky bluegrass (Pea pratensis L.) turf Two root zone mixtures and two N rates were investigated in two independent lysimeter experiments. In the first experiment(1) the 80:20 sand-peat mixture gave better growth and darker-colored turf than the 60:40 sand-peat mixture. Only RC-NPK and water-soluble NPK treatments in this experiment gave acceptable turf quality for the entire growing season. Frequent application with water-soluble fertilizer or spring application with slow-release carriers gave generally <5 mg L-1 NO3-N in the leachate. In the second experiment (2) application of 300 or 450 kg N ha(-1) (either as spring or spring/summer application) as urea-ammonium-nitrate (UAN) (gel) did not give desirable turf growth during the entire period of investigation. Sulfur-coated urea gave generally better turf quality than UAN, but not as good as biweekly compound NPK fertilization. Irrespective of fertilizer N rate, the leaching losses of N varied from 1.1 to 2.9%, giving average NO3-N concentrations in the leachate for all treatments <2 mg L-1. Sandy soil used for sports turf, and fertilized with SCU and RC-NPK, or frequent and small amounts of water-soluble N carriers, appears not to create any serious environmental concern in southern part of Norway where the rainfall is moderate.

AB Soil moisture plays a vital role in regulating the direction and magnitude of methane (CH4) fluxes. However, it remains unclear whether the responses of CH4 fluxes to climate warming exhibit difference between dry and moist ecosystems. Based on standardized manipulative experiments (i.e., consistent experimental design and measurement protocols), here we explored warming effects on growing season CH4 fluxes in two alpine grasslands with contrasting water status on the Tibetan Plateau. We observed that experimental warming enhanced CH4 uptake in the relatively arid alpine steppe, but had no significant effects on CH4 emission in the moist swamp meadow. The distinct responses of CH4 fluxes were associated with the different warming effects on biotic and abiotic factors related to CH4 oxidation and production processes. Warming decreased soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and increased the pmoA gene abundance and CH4 oxidation potential in the alpine steppe, which together led to a significant increase in CH4 uptake at this alpine steppe site. However, warming-induced enhancement in CH4 oxidation potential might be counteracted by the simultaneously increased CH4 production potential in the swamp meadow, which could then result in insignificant warming effects on CH4 emission at this swamp meadow site. Based on a meta-analysis of warming effects on CH4 fluxes across the entire Tibetan Plateau, we found that the entire alpine grasslands could absorb an extra 0.042 Tg CH4 (1 Tg = 10(12) g) per growing season if soil temperature increased by 1 degrees C. These findings demonstrate that warming effects on CH4 fluxes differ between two alpine grasslands with contrasting moisture conditions and the entire alpine grasslands may not trigger a positive CH4 feedback to climate system with moderate warming.

AB The relationship between certain morphological characteristics of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) planting stock (STK) and post-planting seedling performance was evaluated. Root system size at planting, its expansion, and its capacity to conduct water during the first post-planting weeks were determined. These characteristics were related to the performance of STK planted on two forest sites and measured for three growing seasons and to the performance of seedlings grown in large wooden boxes buried in the soil outdoors for one growing season (grown without competition from other vegetation). The compared STK were (i) polystyroblock grown, (ii) polystyroblock grown with chemical root pruning, and (iii) peat-board grown with mechanical root pruning. After three growing seasons on forest sites, seedlings with mechanically pruned roots grew more above ground than did seedlings from polystyroblock containers. This difference in seedling growth performance was even more significant for seedlings grown in wooden boxes. Of these, the mechanically pruned seedlings grew more not only above the ground but they also produced larger root systems by the end of the first growing season. This was despite the initially significantly smaller root systems of mechanically pruned seedlings, compared with the other two STK. Early (5-7 weeks after planting) post-planting root expansion patterns in the three STK were significantly different, with the roots of mechanically pruned seedlings growing less than the roots in the other two STK. In spite of this, pressure-probe measured hydraulic conductivity and water flux through root systems increased during the first post-planting weeks in mechanically pruned seedlings while declining or changing little in the other two STK. It was concluded that root system size at planting and its early post-planting expansion did not relate well to the root system hydraulic properties or to the post-planting seedling growth performance.

AB Boreal peatlands store an enormous pool of soil carbon that is dependent upon - and vulnerable to changes in - climate, as well as plant community composition. However, how nutrient availability affects the effects of climate and vegetation change on ecosystem processes in these nutrient-poor ecosystems remains unclear. Here we show that although warming promoted higher CH4 emissions, the concurrent addition of N counteracted most (79%) of this effect. The regulation effects of the vegetation functional group, associated with the substrate quality, suggest that CH4 emissions from peatlands under future warming will be less than expected with predicted shrub expansion. In contrast, N2O flux will be enhanced under future warming with predicted shrub expansion. Our study suggests that changes in greenhouse gas emissions in response to future warming and shifts in plant community composition depend on N availability, which reveals the complex interactions that occur when N is not a limiting nutrient.

AB This study provides quantitative ecological targets for restoring degraded peat-based Carolina Bays in the Carolina Flatwoods Ecoregion. Cluster analysis of vegetation data from three Carolina Bay reference sites in Bladen County, North Carolina, indicated four plant communities present: pond pine (Pin us serotina) woodland, non-riverine swamp forest dominated by swamp gum (Nyssa biflora), high pocosin dominated by evergreen shrubs with scattered pond pine, and bay forest dominated by loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus). We classified bay soils according to surface organic layer thickness (OLT) into mineral, histic, shallow organic, and deep organic types. We monitored the water table of each soil type in one bay throughout one growing season. The soil types with corresponding water table regimes were: mineral (9.4 cm mean OLT with a rooting zone water table [RZWT] 39% of the monitoring period), histic (27.5 cm OLT and 76% RZWT), shallow organic (63.9 cm OLT and 84% RZWT), and deep organic (102.5 cm OLT and 57% RZWT). Pearson residual analysis and correspondence analysis revealed that pond pine woodland was positively associated with mineral and histic soils, non-riverine swamp forest with shallow organic soil, bay forest with deep organic soil, and high pocosin with deep organic soil. We concluded that peat-based Carolina Bay restoration in the Carolina Flatwoods Ecoregion should be gauged against reference data which suggests: 1) pond pine woodland be established on mineral and histic soils; 2) non-riverine swamp forest be established on shallow organic soils; and 3) high pocosin and bay forest be established on deep organic soils.

AB Palaeoecological investigation of soils exposed by eroding peat haggs on the moors above Tintwistle (Derbyshire) suggests that Mesolithic impact on upland soils between c. 360-500 m OD was not as dramatic, nor as long-lasting, as has sometimes been suggested. Despite evident erosion prior to peat inception, patterning has survived within Mesolithic scatters of artefacts. Neolithic activity is attested by both artefacts and charcoal-rich horizons suggesting intermittent burning of vegetation. Peat finally blanketed these uplands around the start of the second millennium cal. BC.
   These results demonstrate radically different scenarios at different altitudes within relatively small distances across the southern Pennines, shifting our appreciation of the chronology of changes in vegetation and erosion, as well as contributing to wider debate on the causes of moorland development, which can inform future land management.

FX Thanks are due to English Heritage (now Historic England, HE) for fully
   supporting the project intermittently over decades (Pr 1119 - N Peak
   ESA); fieldwork was conducted 1991-93 (when DG was employed by Trent &
   Peak Archaeological Trust), with interim reports circulated after each
   season, then a hiatus due to DG's work circumstances during which time
   the radiocarbon dates on the charcoals were achieved (1994-2001), with
   full archive reporting in 2009, a web paper in 2012 and drafting this
   paper 2012-16. DG's greatest debt is to Ken Smith (PDNPA), project
   director and mentor, for much helpful advice over many years and keeping
   faith in a final product. One regret is not having completed this prior
   to the deaths of Pat Stonehouse and Roger Jacobi, who both willingly
   passed on their knowledge. Many others have also contributed to this
   project. The named authors are thanked for their extreme patience; HE
   staff (present and past) for their numerous contributions including Alex
   Bayliss, Bob Bewley, Andrew Brown, Kate Cullen, Peter Horne, Jonathan
   Last, John Meadows, Pete Marshall, Michael Russell and Pete Wilson, and
   Rowena Gale for charcoal identifications. DG is also grateful to Penny
   Spikins (University of York) for supplying information on the March Hill
   Carr basal peat dates prior to her own publication; to Andrew Myers and
   Nichola Manning (Derbyshire County Council), and to Jason Dodds (West
   Yorkshire Archaeological Advisory Service) for supply of information.
   Thanks to North-West Water and their agents, to the National Trust
   Marsden Moor Office and to English Nature for access and permission to
   conduct the fieldwork in areas of SSSI. The field-team was led by DG
   with Frances Green, Peter Hammond, Richard Jackson and John Watson;
   Frances Green is particularly acknowledged for her very significant
   influence on the thinking and presentation of the fieldwork results. In
   addition, staff, then of the Royal Commission on the Historical

AB Peat is a common substrate used for the cultivation of potted plants. However, the use of peat in horticulture has recently been questioned from an environmental standpoint, since it is a non-renewable resource and plays a major role in atmospheric CO2 sequestration. The aim of this work was to assess the potentialities of substrates obtained from vermicompost, compost and anaerobic digestion processes to partially substitute peat for sage (Salvia officinalis L.) cultivation. Therefore, we planned an experiment to assess the effect of these substrates on essential oil (EO) yield and composition, as well as on leaf nutrients concentration of sage plants. The three substrates were mixed with commercial peat (Radicom) at a ratio of 40% of alternative substrates and 40% of commercial peat. The chemical properties of the alternative substrates did not affect the leaf content of macro and micronutrients, as well as of heavy metals. Moreover, the EO yield and quality was not affected by the substrates and did not differ among them. Results provided evidence that the three alternative substrates can be used to partially substitute peat in soilless cultivation of sage plants. However, due to the higher values of the electrical conductivity of the substrates obtained from composting and anaerobic digestion processes, such substrates must be used with caution.

AB Hydrochars are materials with a promising future, as their high carbon content and porosity renders them suitable for uses including peat substitutes, soil remediation and carbon adsorbent precursors. Combining hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis offers the prospect to provide advanced materials with a higher porosity and carbon content. This approach would mitigate drawbacks associated to hydro-chars, including phytotoxicity. This research studied the influence of pyrolysis temperature and heating time on the resulting properties of chars made from hydrothermal carbonization of biomass wastes at 200 degrees C for 4 h and compared them to biochars that had not received any prior hydrothermal carbonization. Interestingly, hydrochar followed by pyrolysis was able to result in phytostimulation, while, when only pyrolysis was carried out, phytotoxicity was eliminated, but no phytostimulant effect was observed. In addition, the results indicated that the higher and longer the pyrolysis temperature (from 350 to 550 degrees C) and duration time (from 1 to 5 h), respectively, the more microporosity was generated, while phytotoxicity was reduced. In addition, aromaticity and thermal stability significantly increased with pyrolysis treatment. Consequently, hydrochars improve their properties and offer more potential for environmental applications after a pyrolysis post-treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We quantified the wholesale transformation of the boreal landscape by open-pit oil sands mining in Alberta, Canada to evaluate its effect on carbon storage and sequestration. Contrary to claims made in the media, peatland destroyed by open-pit mining will not be restored. Current plans dictate its replacement with upland forest and tailings storage lakes, amounting to the destruction of over 29,500 ha of peatland habitat. Landscape changes caused by currently approved mines will release between 11.4 and 47.3 million metric tons of stored carbon and will reduce carbon sequestration potential by 5,734-7,241 metric tons C/y. These losses have not previously been quantified, and should be included with the already high estimates of carbon emissions from oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading. A fair evaluation of the costs and benefits of oil sands mining requires a rigorous assessment of impacts on natural capital and ecosystem services.

AB The vertical dry strength of rice hull containers was the highest of all containers tested. Plastic containers and paper containers had similar vertical dry strengths. Containers composed of 80% cedar fiber and 20% peat (Fertil), composted dairy manure (Cowpot), and peat had lower dry vertical dry strengths than the aforementioned containers but had higher vertical dry strengths than those composed of bioplastic (OP47), coconut fiber, and rice straw. Rice hull containers and paper containers had the highest lateral dry strengths. Rice straw, Cowpot, and plastic containers had similar dry lateral strengths, which were significantly higher than those of OP47, Fertil, coconut fiber, and peat containers. Highest dry punch strengths occurred with traditional plastic and Cowpot containers, while the lowest dry punch strengths occurred with OP47, Fertil, coconut fiber, peat, and rice straw containers. Plastic, rice hull, and paper containers had the highest wet vertical and lateral strengths. Plastic containers had the highest wet punch strength, while Fertil, Cowpot, and peat containers had the lowest wet punch strengths. When saturated substrate was placed into containers and the substrate surface and drainage holes were sealed with wax, plastic, OP47, and rice hull containers had the lowest rates of water loss per unit of container surface area, while peat, Fertil, and rice straw containers had the highest rates of water loss per unit of container surface area. The amounts of water required to produce a geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum) crop were significantly higher and the average irrigation intervals were shorter for peat, Fertil, coconut fiber, Cowpot, and rice straw containers than for traditional plastic containers. The amounts of water required to produce a geranium crop and the average irrigation intervals were similar among plastic, rice hull, and OP47 containers. Algal and fungal coverage on the outside container walls averaged 47% and 26% for peat and Fertil containers, respectively, and was higher than for all other containers tested, which had 4% or less algal and fungal coverage. After 8 weeks in the field, Cowpot containers had decomposed 62% and 48% in the Pennsylvania and Louisiana locations, respectively. Peat, rice straw, and Fertil containers decomposed 32%, 28%, and 24%, respectively, in Pennsylvania, and 10%, 9%, and 2%, respectively, in Louisiana. Coconut fiber containers had the lowest level of decomposition at 4% and 1.5% in Pennsylvania and Louisiana, respectively.

AB Smoldering combustion of peat receives considerable attention for the substantial destruction of carbon storage and potential health threats from high yields of noxious gaseous products. In this work, the combustion characteristics of peat were investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR) at five heating rates (5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 K min(-1)). The results showed that the combustion process included three stages, corresponding to the processes of dehydration (302-423 K), decomposition of organic matters of peat (423-643 K) and char oxidation (643-873 K). Tiny light organic gas products were generated in a lower temperature range (473-643 K), primarily ascribing to the decomposition of organic matters. Abundant CO2 and slight CO were released in a higher temperature range (643-873 K) during the combustion process, mainly due to char oxidation. A four-step kinetic scheme was developed through Genetic Algorithm and described the combustion kinetics very well. These results provide a better insight into the smoldering combustion characteristics and the gas emission behaviors of peat.

AB The Quebec government has established a program to treat industrial and domestic wastewaters. However, this program does make it necessary to dispose of large quantities of sludge. This sludge can be burned or landfilled but such solutions do not properly draw benefit from the sludge's potential as a fertilizer. There is a considerable interest in composting of the sludge. In this study, compost from the composting plant in Plattsburgh was mixed with the growing substrate normally used for the production of containerized jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) seedlings to determine if the compost could be used for the production in containers of forest seedlings. The growth of containerized seedlings produced with proportions by volume of 80% peat moss and 20% vermiculite was compared to the growth of seedlings when the peat moss (80%) was replaced by different proportions of compost (20, 40, 60, and 80%). After one growing season in tunnel, the best growth rates in terms of shoot height, root-collar diameter, and dry biomass were obtained with the control, followed in decreasing order by the treatments compost 20, 40, 60, and 80%. In this experiment, the use of compost from wastewater treatment plants reduced significantly the growth of jack pine and this can be explained mainly by the lack of nitrogen in the tissues of jack pine seedlings. However, the adjustment of nitrogen fertilization and conditions of cultivation by using compost may permit the production of containerized seedlings having the same dimensions as the controls. The seedling growth parameters when 20% compost was incorporated in the substrate were nearly the same as the control seedling.

AB Pakistan's largest coal reserves are in the Sindh Province. The organic geochemical characteristics and petrographic characteristics of the Tertiary coals in the Thar coalfield, south-eastern Sindh Province, were investigated to their hydrocarbon generative potential and regional rank and to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment conditions during peat accumulation. The Thar coals are lignite to subbituminous C rank, possessing huminite reflectance in the range of 0.26-0.39 % and high moisture and volatile matter contents. The coals have total organic carbon (TOC) content in the range of 47-67 wt%, and hydrogen index values between 105 and 437 mg HC per gram TOC indicate that their organic matter type is dominated by type III and mixed types II-III kerogens, whereby the coals were derived from plant materials of terrigenous origin. If subjected to appropriate burial and heating, the hydrocarbon potential of these coals would be considered to be mainly gas-prone with limited oil-generative capacity. Diagnostic macerals and petrographic facies show that the Thar coals are humic and characterised by predominant huminite with significant amounts of liptinite and low amounts of inertinite macerals, representing predominantly topogenous mires deposited under anaerobic conditions, with limited thermal and oxidative tissue destruction. The palaeoenvironment conditions of the coals are generally interpreted as a lower deltaic plain wet peat-swamp depositional setting, which are generally characterised by low Tissue Preservation Index (TPI) and high Gelification Index (GI) values. These plotted on the marsh field of the Diessel's diagram, consistent with generate relatively high ash yield. The organic facies study also shows that the main coal seams of the Thar coalfields were deposited in limnic freshwater environment, generally wet limno-telmatic zone as supported by relatively low sulphur contents.

AB Forest clear-cutting followed by soil preparation means disturbance for soil microorganisms and disruption of N and C cycles. We measured fluxes of N2O and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in upland soil (podzol) and adjacent peat within a clear-cut forest catchment. Both soil types behaved in a similar way, showing net uptake of N2O in the first year after the clear-cutting, and turning to net release in the second. The N2O flux dynamics were similar to those of N content in logging residues, as reported from a nearby site. As organic matter is used in the food web of the decomposers, we attempted to explain the dynamics of N2O uptake and release by measuring the concurrent dynamics of the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction and the aromaticity of DOC in a soil solution. The labile and most readily available LMW fractions of DOC were nearly absent in the year following the clear-cutting, but rose after two years. The more refractory high molecular weight (HMW) fraction of DOC decreased two years after the clear-cutting. The first year's net uptake of N2O could be accounted for by the growth of decomposer biomass in the logging residues and detritus from the degenerating ground vegetation, resulting in immobilization of nitrogen. Simultaneously, the labile, LMW fraction of DOC became almost completely exhausted. The low availability of the LMW fraction could retard the growth and cause the accumulated decomposer biomass to collapse. During the following winter and summer the fraction of LMW clearly increased, followed by increased N2O emissions. The presence of LMW DOC fractions, not the concentration of DOC, seems to be an important controller for N2O liberation after a major disturbance such as clear-cutting and site preparation. The complex connection between DOC characteristics, nitrification or denitrification merits further studies.

AB This paper presents a characterization of the carbon accumulation process in small Andean wetlands located in the Upper Rio Barbas, in the town of Finlandia, Quindio, Colombia. Decomposition bags were used to estimate organic matter decomposition rates and values for the decomposition constant in the short term; loss on ignition and carbon-14 dating were used to calculate rates of carbon accumulation in the long term. The 52 wetlands occupy an area of 7.2 ha and are located at elevations between 2,000 and 2,200 masl. The decomposition constant, k is 0.524 for wetland soils in contrast with 0.962 for well drained soils. The carbon concentration in the three wetlands varies between 91 and 319 g C kg(-1). Carbon stocks per unit area in the three studied wetlands range between 80 and 117 kg C m(-2). The long term rate of carbon accumulation - LARCA - is between 30 and 50 g C m(-2) yr(-1), comparable to those found for peat areas of Andean paramos.

AB Microfacies and sedimentological analyses of the Upper Permian coal-bearing Heshan Formation in the Heshan coalfield of central Guangxi suggest that these coal measures formed in a marine carbonate platform setting. Low-volatile bituminous coals with very high organic sulphur overlie either palaeosols or locally developed cherts. The petrography and geochemistry of the coals suggest formation in low-lying mires, in which marine influence increased upwards. In the Heshan and overlying Dalong Formations, four third-order sequences are described based on the recognition of four sequence boundaries. Higher-order sequences within each of these third-order sequences are also documented and; within Sequence III, coal seams are developed above higher-order transgressive surfaces, representing the deposits formed during the lag time between initial flooding of the platform and the onset of carbonate production. In the Heshan Formation, the coals with greatest thickness occur immediately above third-order transgressive surfaces. It is argued that, in some coal-bearing siliciclastic-free marine carbonate-platform settings, accommodation creation rates and peat accumulation rates are balanced, hence greater coal accumulation can be achieved at the transgressive surface rather than at the maximum flooding surface.

AB Carbon dioxide efflux and soil microenvironmental factors were measured diurnally in Carex aquatilus- and Eriophorum angustifolium-dominated riparian tundra communities to determine the relative importance of soil environmental factors controlling ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere. Measurements were made weekly between 18 June and 24 July 1990. Diurnal patterns in carbon dioxide efflux were best explained by changes in soil temperature, while seasonal changes in efflux were correlated with changes in depth to water table, depth to frozen soil and soil moisture. Carbon dioxide efflux rates were lowest early in the growing season when high water tables and low soil temperatures limited microbial and root activity. Individual rainfall events that raised the water table were found to strongly reduce carbon dioxide efflux. As the growing season progressed, rainfall was low and depth to water table and soil temperatures increased. In response, carbon dioxide efflux increased strongly, attaining rates late in the season of approximately 10 g CO2 m-2 day-1. These rates are as high as maxima recorded for other arctic sites. A mathematical model is developed which demonstrates that soil temperature and depth to water table may be used as efficient predictors of ecosystem CO2 efflux in this habitat. In parallel with the field measurements Of CO2 efflux, microbial respiration was studied in the laboratory as a function of temperature and water content. Estimates of microbial respiration per square meter under field conditions were made by adjusting for potential respiring soil volume as water table changed and using measured soil temperatures. The results indicate that the effect of these factors on microbial respiration may explain a large part of the diurnal and seasonal variation observed in CO2 efflux. As in coastal tundra sites, environmental changes that alter water table depth in riparian tundra communities will have large effects on ecosystem CO2 efflux and carbon balance.

AB Within northern peatlands, landscape elements such as vegetation and topography are spatially heterogenic from ultra-high (centimeter level) to coarse scale. In addition to within-site spatial heterogeneity, there is evident between-site heterogeneity, but there is a lack of studies assessing whether different combinations of remotely sensed features and mapping approaches are needed in different types of landscapes. We evaluated the value of different mapping methods and remote sensing datasets and analyzed the kinds of differences present in vegetation patterns and their mappability between three northern boreal peatland landscapes in northern Finland. We utilized field-inventoried vegetation plots together with spectral, textural, topography and vegetation height remote sensing data from 0.02- to 3-m pixel size. Remote sensing data included true-color unmanned aerial vehicle images, aerial images with four spectral bands, aerial lidar data and multiple PlanetScope satellite images. We used random forest regressions for tracking plant functional type (PFT) coverage, non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination axes and fuzzy k-medoid plant community clusters. PFT regressions had variable performance for different study sites (R-2 -0.03 to 0.69). Spatial patterns of some spectrally or structurally distinctive PFTs could be predicted relatively well. The first ordination axis represented wetness gradient and was well predicted using remotely sensed data (R-2 0.64 to 0.82), but the other three axes had a less straightforward explanation and lower mapping performance (R-2 -0.09 to 0.53). Plant community clusters were predicted most accurately in the sites with clear string-flark topography but less accurately in the flatter site (R-2 0.16-0.82). The most important remote sensing features differed between dependent variables and study sites: different topographic, spectral and textural features; and coarse-scale and fine-scale datasets were the most important in different tasks. We suggest that multiple different mapping approaches should be tested and several remote sensing datasets used when maps of vegetation are produced.

AB Changes in temperature and carbon dioxide during glacial cycles recorded in Antarctic ice cores are tightly coupled. However, this relationship does not hold for interglacials. While climate cooled towards the end of both the last (Eemian) and present (Holocene) interglacials, CO2 remained stable during the Eemian while rising in the Holocene. We identify and review twelve biogeochemical mechanisms of terrestrial (vegetation dynamics and CO2 fertilization, land use, wildfire, accumulation of peat, changes in permafrost carbon, subaerial volcanic outgassing) and marine origin (changes in sea surface temperature, carbonate compensation to deglaciation and terrestrial biosphere regrowth, shallow-water carbonate sedimentation, changes in the soft tissue pump, and methane hydrates), which potentially may have contributed to the CO2 dynamics during interglacials but which remain not well quantified. We use three Earth System Models (ESMs) of intermediate complexity to compare effects of selected mechanisms on the interglacial CO2 and delta(CO2)-C-13 changes, focusing on those with substantial potential impacts: namely carbonate sedimentation in shallow waters, peat growth, and (in the case of the Holocene) human land use. A set of specified carbon cycle forcings could qualitatively explain atmospheric CO2 dynamics from 8 ka BP to the pre-industrial. However, when applied to Eemian boundary conditions from 126 to 115 ka BP, the same set of forcings led to disagreement with the observed direction of CO2 changes after 122 ka BP. This failure to simulate late-Eemian CO2 dynamics could be a result of the imposed forcings such as prescribed CaCO3 accumulation and/or an incorrect response of simulated terrestrial carbon to the surface cooling at the end of the interglacial. These experiments also reveal that key natural processes of interglacial CO2 dynamics - shallow water CaCO3 accumulation, peat and permafrost carbon dynamics are not well represented in the current ESMs. Global-scale modeling of these long-term carbon cycle components started only in the last decade, and uncertainty in parameterization of these mechanisms is a main limitation in the successful modeling of interglacial CO2 dynamics.

AB Rain-fed peatlands are dominated by peat mosses (Sphagnum sp.), which for their growth depend on nutrients, water and CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. As the isotopic composition of carbon (C-12(,)13) and oxygen (O-16(,)18) of these Sphagnum mosses are affected by environmental conditions, Sphagnum tissue accumulated in peat constitutes a potential long-term archive that can be used for climate reconstruction. However, there is inadequate understanding of how isotope values are influenced by environmental conditions, which restricts their current use as environmental and palaeoenvironmental indicators. Here we tested (i) to what extent C and O isotopic variation in living tissue of Sphagnum is speciesspecific and associated with local hydrological gradients, climatic gradients (evapotranspiration, temperature, precipitation) and elevation; (ii) whether the C isotopic signature can be a proxy for net primary productivity (NPP) of Sphagnum; and (iii) to what extent Sphagnum tissue delta O-18 tracks the delta O-18 isotope signature of precipitation. In total, we analysed 337 samples from 93 sites across North America and Eurasia us ing two important peat-forming Sphagnum species (S. magellanicum, S. fuscum) common to the Holarctic realm. There were differences in delta C-13 values between species. For S. magellanicum delta C-13 decreased with increasing height above the water table (HWT, R-2 = 17 %) and was positively correlated to productivity (R-2 = 7 %). Together these two variables explained 46 % of the between-site variation in delta C-13 values. For S. fuscum, productivity was the only significant predictor of delta C-13 but had low explanatory power (total R-2 = 6 %). For delta O-18 values, approximately 90 % of the variation was found between sites. Globally modelled annual delta O-18 values in precipitation explained 69 % of the between-site variation in tissue delta O-18. S. magellanicum showed lower delta O-18 enrichment than S. fuscum (-0.83 %0 lower). Elevation and climatic variables were weak predictors of tissue delta O-18 values after controlling for delta O-18 values of the precipitation. To summarize, our study provides evidence for (a) good predictability of tissue delta O-18 values from modelled annual delta O-18 values in precipitation, and (b) the possibility of relating tissue delta C-13 values to HWT and NPP, but this appears to be species-dependent. These results suggest that isotope composition can be used on a large scale for climatic reconstructions but that such models should be species-specific.

AB Coal seams of substantial thicknesses and lateral continuity are developed in the Expedition and Iceberg Bay Formations at Strathcona Fiord and in the Expedition Formation at Bache Peninsula. The coals are lignite/subbituminous in rank and have low to moderate sulphur and variable ash contents. At Strathcona Fiord resources have been estimated to be in the order of 1 billion tonnes, whereas at Bache Peninsula estimated resources are 100 million tonnes.
   The coals at Strathcona Fiord are characterized by the dominance of wood-derived macerals of the humotelinite group, whereas at Bache Peninsula the coals have high amounts of detrital macerals (humodetrinite) and also have significant amounts of inertinite macerals. Pollen and spore assemblages in coals from the Iceberg Bay Formation at Strathcona Fiord are dominated by Taxodiaceae pollen with less and variable amounts of Pinaceae pollen, pteridophyte spores and angiosperm pollen. The pollen and spore assemblages indicate a Late Paleocene-Early Eocene age of the Iceberg Bay Formation coals. The Expedition Formation coals at Bache Peninsula have in general a somewhat less diverse pollen and spore assemblage and show a larger input of fern and Sphagnum spores. The pollen and spore assemblages in Expedition Formation coals at Bache Peninsula are indicative of (Early?) Paleocene age.
   The depositional environment for Iceberg Bay Formation coals at Strathcona Fiord is that of a forested swamp, which formed on a broad coastal plain. At Bache Peninsula peats formed in broad valleys, in which a fluviatile-lacustrine environment of deposition prevailed. The mires were likely less forested than at Strathcona Fiord as indicated by the abundance of ferns and sphagnum spores and the very low content of wood-derived macerals of the humotelinite group. The pollen assemblages in both Expedition and Iceberg Bay Formation coals indicate a temperate climate and moderate precipitation during peat accumulation.

AB Reactivity of atmospherically deposited nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) was investigated in three mountain forest catchments and one ombrotrophic peat bog located in the northern Czech Republic. The study sites are characterized by moderate to high N pollution rates that are currently decreasing. Monitoring of hydrodynamic data and catchment hydrochemistry (precipitation, soil solutions and runoff) was complemented by delta N-15 analyses of dissolved inorganic N (NO3-, NH4+). Measured delta N-15 data were used to calculate the extent of biogeochemical reactions and to construct N mass balances. Two-component models of runoff generation were developed using hydrological and delta O-18-H2O data on local precipitation, runoff, and soil waters collected by lysimeters. Catchment discharge was formed by groundwater (60-80%) and storm precipitation (40-20%), with minimal time lags. Groundwater had a diluting effect on reactions proceeding in the soil zone, including nitrification and denitrification. The rates of nitrification were estimated by comparing the delta N-15 values of atmospheric input and soil water, while the rates of denitrification were derived from the differences in the delta N-15 values of soil water and stream discharge. The Nu isotope effect of mineralisation of organic N was assessed by comparing delta N-15 values of soil and soil extracts. Nitrogen release from the catchments was controlled by temperature-dependent seasonality of soil reactions. Atmospheric N entered the runoff directly only during a short late winter - early spring period, accounting for approximately 10% of the total N input. Important inputs of mineralised organically cycled soil N were observed at the beginning and the end of the growing season, with measurable denitrification occurring during the same time periods. The measured apparent N isotope fractionations were significantly lower than previously published values (-3 to -14 parts per thousand vs. -30 parts per thousand for nitrification, and -3 vs. -20 parts per thousand for denitrification). Lower N-15 fractionations originated both from the dilution effect of groundwater on stream discharge and from the depletion of available ammonium during nitrification reactions. Denitrification proceeding during recharge of the groundwater body was estimated from the difference in the delta N-15 values of NO(3)(- )in precipitation and groundwater.

AB Incorporation of organic materials into soil improves the soil sorption capacity, while limiting the mobility of metals in soil and their availability to plants. These effects can be taken advantage for remediation of soils polluted with heavy metals. The objective of this study is to assess the remediatory potential of peat applied to soils with concomitant pollution with Cd, Pb, and Zn. Two 1-year experiments were run in microplots in which maize was grown as the test plant. The following treatments were compared on two soils (sandy soil and loess): (1) control, (2) heavy metals (HM), (3) HM+peat in a single dose, and (4) HM+peat in a double dose. Maize was harvested in the maturity stage; the biomass of roots and aerial parts, including grain and cobs, was measured. Besides, concentration of metals in all those plant parts and the net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate were determined. The approach of using peat in soil remediation led to satisfactory results on sandy soil only. The application of peat to sandy soil caused significant changes in the accumulation of the metals and their translocation from roots to other parts of plants, which resulted in a higher intensity of photosynthesis and an increase in the maize biomass compared to the HM treatment.

AB Glacial recession is a major process in terrestrial ecosystems of the world and an obvious result of global warming Here we describe the alpine (above tree line) and subalpine forested and wetland/peatland vegetation chronosequences in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska We derived the results from three products (1) 4 deglaciation map of 50,000-, 13,000, and 1 to 246-year-old (Neoglacial) surfaces, (2) a landcover map, and (3) a plant association classification For the alpine chronosequence, Neoglactal surfaces are dominated by the tall shrub (>1 5 m) (Alnus and Salix), dwarf shrub (<0 1 m) (Salix and Dryas), and mesic herbaceous landcover classes These landcover classes also dominate the 13,000- and 50,000-year-old surfaces but dwarf shrub dominance changes to ericaceous The subalpine forested chronosequence consists of Populus balsamifera ssp trichocarpa and Picea sitchensis classes dominating the mid- and late seral Neoglacial surfaces, then Tsuga mertensiana and Picea sitchensis classes dominating the 13,000- and 50,000-year-old surfaces Wetlands/peatlands are rare on the Neoglacial and 13,000-year-old surfaces but common on the 50,000-year-old surface Alnus is rare on the 50,000-year-old surface yet common on the 13,000-year-old surface and, we speculate, is a relict from the end of the Pleistocene

AB The present results are the effect of bioprospecting of an appropriate medium, which could optimize the quality and quantity of the microalga Pseudopiediastrum boryanum var. longicorne Reinsch biomass cultured in a laboratory photobioreactor for biosorption purposes. Four liquid media commonly used for cultivation of green algae of the genus Pediastrum were compared, including Knop's, Waris-H, Chu's and L-S2T2 media, which differed with respect to the composition and concentration of nutrients. A number of the parameters characterizing biomass growth, namely dry weight, optical density, chlorophyll a concentration, as well as morphological parameters characterizing the condition of the alga and its surface area indicating the potential sorption capacity (population structure, cell number, coenobium size and marginal cell size), showed a significant impact of culture medium on the growth of the microalga. The most productive culture was found in the L-S2T2 medium containing organic substances in the form of peat and soil extracts, which could be crucial for biomass production and the area of potential sorption capacity.

ID DESORPTION
AB We studied the adsorption of two herbicides of different polarity, linuron and metamitron, by a mineral soil and two peats at different decomposition stages and determined Freundlich and distribution coefficients per unit of organic matter. The Freundlich adsorption constant (K-f) was 20 to 30-fold higher in the case of linuron and 40- to 90-fold higher for metamitron for the organic materials (peats) than for the mineral soil, reflecting adsorption dependence on both organic matter content and type. The well-decomposed peat showed the highest affinity for both herbicides. Hydrophobic bonding is suggested as a possible explanation. For linuron, the variation in K-oc was reduced to less than a twofold variation in K-oc by normalizing adsorption to organic carbon, whereas for metamitron, K-oc values were not constant, confirming that this parameter may be of little meaning for polar compounds.

AB Quantitative relationships between the active acidity of peat soils on the one hand and their exchange acidity (pH(KCl)), nonexchangeble (total potential) acidity (1M CH3COONa extract), contents of exchange cations and alkaline-earth bases, and base saturation degree, on the other hand, have been identified in the form of a linear function. Coefficients of the resultant regression equations are provided. The high predictive capability of the produced regression models is proven using independent data as examples. The use of regression equations eliminates the need for time-consuming chemical analytical works, thus making it possible to operatively classify wetlands and peat soils on the basis on their chemical properties: saturation with alkaline-earth bases and pH value. The botanical composition may also be used as a reliable indicator, provided that the degree of peat decomposition is low and subject to special knowledge of morphology and anatomy of sphagnum mosses and vascular swamp plants.

AB Phytostabilization with native plant species might represent an economically more realistic and cost-effective option than excavation, soil washing, and sludge disposal for rehabilitation of degraded and polluted industrial areas. This work was done to assess the changes induced by native plant revegetation in the chemical properties and mobility-bioavailability of Pb and Zn pollutants of soil and post-washing sludges from an Italian brownfield site of national interest.
   A 5-year native plant revegetation of polluted soil and relative post-washing sludges from a steel plant was achieved in situ and ex situ in pot and in the presence and absence of peat as organic amendment. During the experiment, the vegetation growth was monitored (Adamo et al. In Int J Environ Sci Technol 12(6):1811-1824, 2015). Before and after plant growth, the substrates were studied for pH, organic carbon, and carbonate contents. Lead, Zn, and other metal mobility and leachability were investigated by water extraction. The metal bioavailability was estimated by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) extraction at pH 7.3. Sequential extractions (BCR procedure) were used to fractionate Pb and Zn in soil main geochemical forms. Plant ability to uptake metals was evaluated on the three most representative species: Bituminaria bituminosa, Daucus carota, and Dactylis glomerata.
   After 5 years of revegetation with native plants, the substrate pH and organic carbon content were respectively decreased and increased by plant growth, with changes masked by peat treatments. Although metal pollutants in both substrates were characterized by low water solubility and DTPA availability, after plant growth, an increase of rhizospheric Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn solubility in H2O was detected. According to metal speciation, Pb and Zn were largely occluded in easily reducible manganese/iron oxides and trapped in the mineral structure of silicates, with no visible changes of distribution after plants. Water extraction always underestimated plant uptake, whereas DTPA and sequential extractions better predicted Pb and Zn uptake.
   Despite the original extremely low mobility and bioavailability of metal pollutants in both soil and post-washing sludges, the acidification and increase of organic carbon content induced by peat amendments and plant growth enhance the solubility in water of metal-containing compounds. Therefore, attention must be paid to these effects in the long period. A continuous monitoring of the changes of pollutant mobility-bioavailability induced by native plant revegetation of brownfields is crucial to prevent risks to the surrounding environment and human health.

AB Dinosaur footprints were found in Pliensbachian terrigenous rocks in the central North Caucasus. Tracks of different sizes (12-35 cm) were identified at three levels of the Mizur Formation section. The sediments accumulated on the wide (15-20 km) shelf of a paleobasin. The coastal land was covered with abundant vegetation. The warm and humid climate favored the development of weathering crusts, lake-bog systems, and peat accumulation. The seawater temperature ranged from 21 to 25 degrees C. The accumulation of sediments on the shallow shelf and their distribution over the area were influenced by wave activity, currents, and tidal phenomena. At low tide, small dinosaurs visited the shelf zone in order to search for food in the form of benthic fauna, which was abundant in clayey-silty sediments. The simultaneous presence of significantly different-size animal tracks may indicate that large individuals preyed on smaller ones. The presence of dinosaur tracks at different levels of the upper Pliensbachian strata indicates that representatives of the terrestrial fauna periodically visited the paleoshelf during the Domerian.

AB Antibiotics are the foundation of modern medicine, and the sustainability of antibiotic use depends on overcoming the challenge of antibiotic resistance (AR). This may be extremely difficult, given that antibiotic production by environmental microbiota is a natural process and AR is widespread in nature. AR has been shown to spread readily and quickly, as well as to exist in the absence of anthropogenic forcing (i.e., the application of antibiotics by humans). This study compared a range of approaches to identify AR gene sequences in microbial community genomes in three habitats (Palsa, Bog, and Fen) across a permafrost thaw gradient in Abisko, Sweden. Depending on the search algorithm used, we found a range of 0.72-1.29% AR protein-coding genes across all habitats, with model-based search algorithms resulting in greater sensitivity than traditional identity-based approaches for identifying AR sequences. Though each habitat within the permafrost gradient showed different cell densities, pH, bioavailable carbon, water content, nutrient availability, and other factors that impact microbial life, the difference in overall AR protein abundance between habitats was not significant. Examination of AR at this location will contribute to our understanding of AR presence in natural environments and how AR may be impacted by permafrost thawing related to global warming.

DT Article
AB Fertilization of ecological cultivating systems for producing greenhouse tomatoes with locally produced mulches was studied from 1993 to 1995. The tomato plants were cultivated in limited growth beds filled with nutrient-poor substrate, consisting of farmyard manure (MM) compost, straw and soil subsequently mixed with peat and gypsum. Mulches of freshly cut grass or clover or a mixture of the two were placed on the surface of the substrate to assess their value as fertilizer. Fruit yield, fruit quality, plant length and NPK-content of mulch materials and bed water were regularly measured. Comparisons made on four occasions during each growing season showed that the mulches containing clover produced significantly higher yield than the grass mulch and this treatment also had the best utilization of P and K. Nitrogen utilization was highest in beds fertilized with grass mulch, even though the yield was lower, Combined mulch of grass and clover produced intermediate yield and had good utilization of N, P and K. However the clover-grass mulch seemed to have potential for higher yield than was found in the experiment.

SO PLANT PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The incidence of potato pathogens on healthy roots of micropropagated (MP) and seed tuber (ST) plants was examined on successive dates during the growing season in two field experiments. Microplants were grown in a glasshouse for 4-5 weeks in perlite or peat-based substrates, and exposed or not to natural inoculum before planting in the field. The seed tubers originated from stocks of visually clean or moderately blemished tubers and were surface-sterilized or not before planting. Polyscytalum pustulans and Helminthosporium solani only infected roots of ST plants and inoculated MP plants. The incidence of P. pustulans was affected by seed tuber-borne inoculum and, in 1 year, by the substrate. H. solani was detected infrequently on roots. Rhizoctonia solani was present at low frequencies in most root samples, and more ST than MP plant roots were colonized, there were no substrate effects. In 1 year, increased inoculum levels increased root infection, but only in MP roots. Colletotrichum coccodes occurred at high frequencies and was most common in roots of ST plants. Progeny tubers showed some treatment effects when tested in September and after storage for 6 months, but there were no consistent relationships between root and progeny tuber infection.

AB Use of wood ash or a mixture of wood and oil shale ashes increases the concentrations of P and K in the assimilation organs of conifers and stimulates tree growth.
   The effect of fertilization with wood ash (10 and 15 t ha(-1)) and a mixture of wood ash (10 t ha(-1)) and oil shale ash (8 t ha(-1)) on the growth (height, root collar diameter, biomass, biomass production) and nutrient concentrations in subsoil and needles of young Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies plants on the Puhatu (Northeast Estonia) cutaway peatland in the first 2 years were studied. After the second growing year differences in the average height growth of P. abies and P. sylvestris were statistically significantly higher on ash-treated plots than on the control plots (p < 0.05), being respectively 1.4-1.6 and 1.5-1.7 times greater than height growth of the control trees. The best results on root collar diameter were observed on mixture ash treatments: the root collars were 1.9 (P. abies) and 2.2 (P. sylvestris) times larger than of the control trees. The biomass of the two conifer species and the biomass production of P. sylvestris in 2012 was the greatest on the mixture ash treatments. Five months after fertilization with ashes the concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg were higher on the treated plots than on the control plot. Although the concentrations of P and K in P. sylvestris needles rose after the treatment with ash, seedlings suffered from P and K deficiency. The concentrations of P and K in P. abies needles were on optimum. The P/N and the K/N ratios in needles were also improved compared to control trees needles.

AB Integration between mycoherbicides and herbicide (glyphosate) application for the control of branched broomrape (Orobanche ramosa) was carried out during early summer (January 2006) in a tomato field naturally infested with O. ramosa at Giza governorate, Egypt. Mycoherbicides, Trichoderma harzianum (T-1 and T-3) and T. viride (T-2) were used in this study. Tomato seeds cv. GS(12) were sown in polystyrene foam cells containing peat-moss soil inoculated three times (once/week) with each testedmycoherbicide. The herbicide glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] was also used as a foliar spray at a rate of 50 mL/L. This was applied one time only, 10 days after tomato seedling transplantation during the growing season. Under field conditions, significant reduction in the incidence and intensity of branched broomrape infection was observed in the combined mycoherbicidal and herbicidal treatments. The application of mycoherbicides followed by foliar spray with glyphosate was the most appropriate treatment. This resulted in the highest reduction in the parasitic parameters of O. ramosa, although a lesser increase in tomato yield in comparison with the individual mycoherbicide approaches was recorded. The present work developed an effective, applicable and cost-effective method acceptable for controlling O. ramosa in tomato fields.

AB This study analyses long-term water quality data from an upland peat catchment in order to understand long-term changes in hydrological flowpaths and how they relate to recovery from severe drought and control the release of DOC. The study examined comparative records from rainfall, soil and stream samples over a 9-year period, which included an approximately I in 30-year drought 2 years into the period. The study examined single tracers and utilised multivariate statistics to examine changing sources and routes of runoff. The study shows that the severe drought is part of dry period not restricted to a single summer and this extended dry period may give rise to the extent of the chemical changes observed in the stream chemistry. During this period of drought there is no evidence for substantive new flowpaths being generated during the drought, instead the residence time of the water in the upper peat horizon (< 10 cm depth) increases and that this increase is reflected in the chemistry of runoff. The soil waters deeper in the peat profile (approx. 50 cm) show increased influence of rainwater compositions and that during drought the residence times at depth increase. There is an offset between the severe drought and maximums in concentrations of Fe, DOC and Al are related to the hydrophobic nature of the peat matrix. The effects of a 30-year drought persisted for no more than 3 years ending with the end of the dry period, and at least the effects of severe drought lasted only a year. The study suggests that in peat catchments summer's are hydrologically independent of the winters and this fact limits the consequences of severe drought. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To estimate the impact of a volcanic eruption on vegetation, we conducted a field survey and collected peaty sediments and made pollen and tephra analysis from Barasantou Bog, in eastern Hokkaido, northern Japan. Using an electron probe micro-analyzer, we identified five tephra layers in the core: Ma-g (7.6 cal ka BP), Ma-e (5.5 cal ka BP), Ma-d (4.0 cal ka BP), Ta-c (2.5 cal ka BP), and Ko-c2 (AD 1694). When the peat began to accumulate again after deposition of the Ma-g tephra, the groundwater level of this area was very low, and Alnus, Poaceae, Thalictrum, Artemisia, and ferns dominated. Gradually, the groundwater level increased, and the condition of this wetland approached the present conditions, about 5.0 to 4.5 cal ka BP. Pinaceae conifers increased 2.5 cal ka BP. It is presumed that Picea glehnii and Abiesspecies formed wetland forests. Myrica gale and Alnus increased again, and grew to the edge of the wetland. At the same time, Quercus subgen. Lepidobalanus decreased and Betula increased. This trend might be due to the influence of human activity. The wetland vegetation changed from Thalictrum and Artemisia to Sanguisorba, and then from Sanguisorba to Menyanthes after the deposition of Ma-g tephra or after 2.5 ka BP. It was thought that the wetland changed from low moor to middle or high moor. A tephra layer tens of cm thick is not expected to affect pollen composition, and may have no clear impact on the surrounding vegetation. Sediment with a thickness of a few cm requires a deposition time of approximately 10 years; pollen analysis results are on the scale of the average vegetation change during that period. We conclude that short-term vegetation changes were not detected.

AB Much uncertainty still exists regarding spatial and temporal variability of stable isotope ratios ((13)C/(12)C and D/H) in different CH(4)-emission sources. Such variability is especially prevalent in freshwater wetlands where a range of processes can influence stable isotope compositions, resulting in variations of up to similar to 50 parts per thousand for delta(13)C-CH(4) and similar to 150 parts per thousand for delta D-CH(4) values. Within a temperate-zone bog and marsh situated in southwestern Ontario, Canada, gas bubbles in pond sediments exhibit only minor seasonal and spatial variation in delta(13)C-CH(4), delta D-CH(4) and delta(13)C-CO(2) values. In pond sediments, CO(2) appears to be the main source of carbon during methanogenesis either directly via CO(2) reduction or indirectly through dissimilation of autotrophic acetate. In contrast, CH(4) production occurs primarily via acetate fermentation at shallow depths in peat soils adjacent to ponds at each wetland. At greater depths within soils, Sigma CO(2) and H(2)O increasingly exert an influence on delta(13)C- and delta D-CH(4) values. Secondary alteration processes (e.g., methanotrophy or diffusive transport) are unlikely to be responsible for depth-related changes in stable isotope values of CH(4). Recent models that attempt to predict delta D-CH(4) values in freshwater environments from D/H ratios in local precipitation do not adequately account for such changes with depth. Subenvironments (i.e., soil-forming and open water areas) in wetlands should be considered separately with respect to stable isotope signatures in CH(4) emission models.

AB In this study, we have analysed the series of daily air temperatures from 1977 to 2009 measured in a sedge-grass marsh ecosystem near the town of Tebo, Czech Republic (Central Europe). Annual averages of daily mean, minimum and maximum temperatures were analysed. Possible significant increases were recorded for all these values during the study period. The annual average of daily maximum temperatures increased on average by 0.0827 degrees C per year. The annual average of daily mean air temperatures increased by 0.0544 degrees C per year. The rise of the annual average of daily minimum air temperature was the lowest, namely by 0.0374 degrees C per year. The air temperature rise was not the same in all periods of the year, and different increases were found in individual months. The daily mean air temperature rose significantly in the growing season (AprilAugust). In all the other months except December, a statistically non-significant rise of daily mean air temperatures was recorded. From the ecological point of view, the different monthly increases are more important for the wetland ecosystem than the slow gradual rise of air temperature over the years. The air temperature rise recorded in the wetland studied was lower than that predicted by climatic models. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In recent years, monitoring of the status of ecosystems using low-cost web (IP) or time lapse cameras has received wide interest. With broad spatial coverage and high temporal resolution, networked cameras can provide information about snow cover and vegetation status, serve as ground truths to Earth observations and be useful for gap-filling of cloudy areas in Earth observation time series. Networked cameras can also play an important role in supplementing laborious phenological field surveys and citizen science projects, which also suffer from observer-dependent observation bias. We established a network of digital surveillance cameras for automated monitoring of phenological activity of vegetation and snow cover in the boreal ecosystems of Finland. Cameras were mounted at 14 sites, each site having 1-3 cameras. Here, we document the network, basic camera information and access to images in the permanent data repository (http://www.zenodo.org/communities/phenology_camera/). Individual DOI-referenced image time series consist of half-hourly images collected between 2014 and 2016 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1066862). Additionally, we present an example of a colour index time series derived from images from two contrasting sites.

AB Studies of both macro- and micro- fossil plants have been increasingly used to help in our understanding of the formation of peats and coals as well as in the study of associated clastic sequences.  This increase of interest is, in part, due to technological and methodological advances but also because of the need to develop interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary studies to solve fundamental problems.  In this brief summary, discussion is presented of our increasing knowledge of the peat (coal)- forming vegetation and recent advances in coal seam profiling both using macrofossil coal-ball and palynological data.  Secondly, I consider new work on the distribution of organic particles in sediments and their potential use in palaeonenvironmental and palaeoecological analysis.  The importance of integrating botanical, petrological and geochemical data is emphasized.  The impact of new microscopical and image analysis techniques is assessed.  The role of experimental work on the origin of coal macerals as well as the need to study modern peat forming environments is discussed.

AB A peat core from southern Greenland provided a rare opportunity to investigate human-environment interactions, climate change and atmospheric pollution over the last similar to 700 years. X-ray fluorescence, gas chromatography-combustion, isotope ratio mass spectrometry, peat humification and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were applied and combined with palynological and archaeological evidence. Variations in peat mineral content seem to be related to soil erosion linked with human activity during the late Norse period (13th-14th centuries AD) and the modern era (20th century). Cooler conditions during the Little Ice Age (LIA) are reflected by both slow rates of peat growth and carbon accumulation, and by low bromine (Br) concentrations. Sporer and Maunder minima in solar activity may be indicated by further declines in Br and enrichment in easily degradable compounds such as polysaccharides. Peat organic matter composition was also influenced by vegetation changes at the end of the LIA when the expansion of oceanic heath was associated with polysaccharide enrichment Atmospheric lead pollution was recorded in the peat after similar to AD 1845, and peak values occurred in the 1970s. There is indirect support for a predominantly North American lead source, but further Pb isotopic analysis would be needed to confirm this hypothesis. (C) 2015 University of Washington.

DE alpha-amino N; extractable organic nitrogen; free amino N; organic soils
AB Organic nitrogen (DON) was extracted from two improved pasture soils, one of which had been re-colonized by acid heath vegetation, and a blanket peat. Although the quantities extracted in H2O, 10 mM CaCl2, 500 mM K2SO4 and 50 mM Na2HPO4 were not consistent, mean extractable DON as a proportion of total N was greater in the two grazed pastures (0.4%) than in the peat (0.2%). Averaged over the four extractants, free alpha-amino N was greater in the peat and least in the improved pasture soil and accounted for 26% of DON in the peat and less than 5% in the mineral soil. Amino N increased after 6 M HCl hydrolysis, and this combined N contributed 56% to DON in extracts of the mineral soil compared with only 36% in the peat This variation in the relative contributions of free and combined amino N to DON indicated qualitative differences in the composition of DON between the three soils.

AB An incubation experiment was carried out to test the effects of biogenic municipal waste (compost I) and shrub/grass (compost II) composts in comparison to peat on respiration and microbial biomass in soil. The amounts of these three substrates added were linearly increased in the range of field application rates (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%). The SUM Of CO2 evolved during the incubation was markedly raised by the three substrates and increased with the rate of substrate concentration. However, the percentage of substrate mineralized to CO2 decreased with the addition rate from 103 to 56% for compost I, from 81 to 56% for compost II, and from 21 to 8% for peat. During the first 25 days of incubation, compost I enlarged the biomass C content, which remained constant until the end. In contrast, compost II did not raise biomass C initially. But at the end of the incubation, the biomass C content of all 4 compost II treatments almost reached the level of the respective compost I treatment. The increase was significantly larger the more of the two composts was added. In contrast to the two composts, the addition of peat did not have any significant effect on microbial biomass C. The average qCO(2) values at day 25 declined in the order compost I > compost II > peat, at day 92 the order was changed to compost II > peat > compost 1. This change in the order was caused by a significant decrease in qCO(2) values of the compost I treatments, a significant increase in qCO2 values of the peat treatments and constant qCO(2) values in the compost II treatments.

DE South China Sea; marginal basins; land-sea interactions; peat
   dispersion; Oligocene
AB In the present study, the coal-rock organic facies of Oligocene Yacheng Formation of the marginal basin in the South China Sea were classified and divided. In addition, through the correlations of the large-scale coal-bearing basins between the epicontinental sea and the South China Sea, it was concluded that the coal forming activities in the South China Sea presented particularity and complexity. Furthermore, the coal forming mechanisms also presented distinctiveness. The marginal basins in the South China Sea consist of several large and complex rift or depression basins, which are distributed at different tectonic positions in the South China Sea. Therefore, the marginal basins in the South China Sea are not simple traditional units with onshore continental slopes extending toward the deep sea. The marginal basins are known to consist of multi-level structures and distinctive types of basins which differ from the continental regions to the sea. During the Oligocene, the existing luxuriant plants and beneficial conditions assisted in the development of peat. Therefore, the Oligocene was the significant period for the formation and aggregation of the peat. However, the peat did not form in unified sedimentary dynamic fields, but instead displayed multi-level geographical units, multiple provenance areas, instability, and nonevent characteristics. As a result, the marginal basins in the South China Sea are characterized by non-uniform peat aggregation stages. In another words, the majority of the peat had entered the marine system in a dispersive manner and acted as part of the marine deposits, rather than during one or several suitable coal-forming stages. These peat deposits then became the main material source for hydrocarbon generation in all of the marginal basins of the South China Sea. The study will be of much significance for the hydrocarbon exploration in the marginal basins of the South China Sea.

AB In terms of agricultural use, peat soils have weak structure, high water content, insufficient soil aeration and poor thermal properties resulting in suboptimal physical properties and yields of grass. During the period 1978 - 1995, a long-term field trial was conducted on highly decomposed peat soil in order to investigate the impact of adding mineral materials to improve soil characteristics and increase grass yield. Shell sand or moraine soil (200, 400 or 800 m(3) ha(-1)) was incorporated into peat soil. Generally, addition of both shell sand and moraine soil improved the physical properties of the soil and grass production. During the first nine years, shell sand ( 400 m 3 ha(-1)) was the most efficient. Thereafter, moraine soil ( 400 and 800 m(3) ha(-1)) seemed most beneficial. This study indicates that additions of shell sand or moraine soil to peat are appropriate methods to improve and conserve the physical properties and cropping potential of these vulnerable soils.

AB Estimation of the carbon (C) storages and fluxes in different forest ecosystems is essential for understanding their C sequestration ability. The net ecosystem production (NEP) and the net primary production (NPP) in five downy birch (Betula pubescens) stands, aged between 12 and 78 years, growing on fertile well-drained Histosols, were studied. Drainage of swamp forests is a large-scale manipulation, which causes significant shifts at the ecosystems level, altering C and nutrient cycling a great deal. Young and middle-aged downy birch stands (12-30-year-old) acted as C sink ecosystems, accumulating 1.4-3.0 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). In the 38-year-old stand NEP was roughly zero; annual C budget was almost in balance. The over-matured downy birch stand (78-year-old) acted as a C source emitting 0.95 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Annual woody biomass increment of the stand was the main factor which affected the forest to act as a C accumulating system. Although the highest heterotrophic respiration (Rh) values were measured in the middle-aged stands, mean soil C emission did not differ significantly between the studied stands. Annual total soil respiration (Rs) and Rh ranged from 7.4 to 8.8 t C ha(-1) and 4.7 to 6.2 t C ha(-1), respectively. Soil temperature appeared to be the dominant driver of the soil CO2 effluxes. Temperature sensitivity (Q(10) value) of respiration rates (3.0-5.5), as well as the Rh/Rs (0.6-0.7) varied irrespective of stand age. Both the annual aboveground litter (1.5-1.9 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and fine root litter (0.9-1.5 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)) input fluxes were quite similar for the studied stands. However, the annual organic C input into the soil via above- and belowground litter was smaller than the annual Rh efflux, indicating that continuous mineralization of the peat layer reduces the soil organic C pool. The main share of the C stock in the drained swamp downy birch stands was soil C; the storage of C accumulated in the woody biomass of the trees accounted for only 5-20% of the total C storage of the ecosystem.

AB A laboratory bench-scale fixed-bed column study operated as a down-flow configuration was conducted to evaluate Sphagnum peat moss and crushed mollusk shells as natural low-cost adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals from aerated and unaerated synthetic landfill leachate. Columns were packed with 15 cm of prepared peat moss, or 15 cm adsorbent mixtures made up of peat moss and crushed mollusk shells (4.0-4.75 mm) from Lake Ontario at different bed depth ratios. Peat was found to have the best adsorption capacities in columns treating aerated synthetic leachate for cadmium and nickel with 78.6% and 83.8% removal efficiencies, respectively. The removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen from the synthetic leachate was also monitored to evaluate the potential effects of biological activity on heavy metal adsorption. Columns receiving unaerated raw synthetic leachates did not show any significant removal of COD and total nitrogen, whereas some reduction in COD and total nitrogen was noted in the columns treating aerated synthetic landfill leachate. The results suggested that biological activity and biofilm growth could positively contribute to heavy metal retention within the fixed-media biosorption columns.

AB Many species use coarse woody debris (CWD) and are disadvantaged by the forestry-induced loss of this resource. A neglected process affecting CWD is the covering of the surfaces of downed logs caused by sinking into the ground (increasing soil contact, mostly covering the underside of the log), and dense overgrowth by ground vegetation. Such cover is likely to profoundly influence the quality and accessibility of CWD for wood-inhabiting organisms, but the factors affecting covering are largely unknown. In a five-year experiment we determined predictors of covering rate of fresh logs in boreal forests and clear-cuts. Logs with branches were little covered because they had low longitudinal ground contact. For branchless logs, longitudinal ground contact was most strongly related to estimated peat depth (positive relation). The strongest predictor for total cover of branchless logs was longitudinal ground contact. To evaluate the effect on cover of factors other than longitudinal ground contact, we separately analyzed data from only those log sections that were in contact with the ground. Four factors were prominent predictors of percentage cover of such log sections: estimated peat depth, canopy shade (both increasing cover), potential solar radiation calculated from slope and slope aspect, and diameter of the log (both reducing cover). Peat increased cover directly through its low resistance, which allowed logs to sink and soil contact to increase. High moisture and low temperatures in pole-ward facing slopes and under a canopy favor peat formation through lowered decomposition and enhanced growth of peat-forming mosses, which also proved to rapidly overgrow logs. We found that in some boreal forests, peat and fast-growing mosses can rapidly cover logs lying on the ground. When actively introducing CWD for conservation purposes, we recommend that such rapid covering is avoided, thereby most likely improving the CWD's longevity as habitat for many species.

AB Given the bioremediation potential of peat, natural capping of landfills in wetlands with a "peat cap" could provide a sustainable addition to regular capping methods using basal liners with limited life-spans and sand. It is unknown, however, which initial conditions optimise growth of this "peat cap" on top of as and layer. Here, we tested the combined effects of topsoil addition (clay or organic soil) and vegetation type (Typha latifolia, T. angustifolia, Stratiotes aloides and submerged spp.) on net ecosystem C exchange and water quality in 18 sandy basins situated in a constructed wetland on top of a landfill. Although the highest net C sequestration rates occurred in Typha stands on sand, due to lower decomposition-related C losses as compared to clay and organic topsoils, vegetation development was slow and its cover was very low (15%) compared to clay (40%) and organic topsoils (70%). As this strongly impeded the build-up of a uniform peat layer, we conclude that, within a restricted time frame, the application of nutrient-richtop soils is still necessary for sufficient biomass production to accumulate organic material. By recycling local soils, the accompanying initial C loss becomes negligible on a landscape scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Temperate wetlands have been undergoing increased nitrogen (N) inputs in the past decades, yet its influence on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics is still elusive in these ecosystems. Here, using a field multi-level N addition (0, 6,12, and 24 g N m(-2) year(-1)) experiment, we investigated the changes in aboveground plant biomass, DOC production from plant litters, DOC biodegradation, and DOC concentration in surface water and soil pore water (0-15 cm depth) following 10 years of N addition in a freshwater marsh of Northeast China. We observed that, irrespective of N addition levels, N addition caused an increase in DOC production from plant litters under both non-flooded and flooded conditions. Conversely, DOC biodegradation was inhibited by N addition in both surface water and soil pore water. Because of enhanced DOC production from plant litters and declined DOC biodegradation, N addition elevated DOC concentration in surface water and soil pore water across the growing season. In addition, long-term N addition increased aboveground plant biomass, but decreased species richness. Our results suggest that long-term N enrichment promotes DOC accumulation through the contrasting effects on litter-derived DOC production and microbial decomposition of DOC in temperate wetlands.

AB Implementation of construction works on weak (e.g., compressible, collapsible, expansive) soils such as peatlands often is limited by logistics of equipment and shortage of available and applicable materials. If preloading or floating roads on geogrid reinforcement or piled embankments cannot be implemented, then soil stabilization is needed. Sustainable soil stabilization in an environmentally friendly way is recommended instead of applying known conventional methods such as pure cementing or excavation and a single replacement of soils. Substitution of conventional material (cement) and primary raw material (lime) with secondary raw material (waste and byproducts from industries) corresponds to the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations, preserves resources, saves energy, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Besides traditional material usage, soil stabilization is achievable through various secondary raw materials (listed according to their groups and subgroups): 1. thermally treated waste products: 1.1. ashes from agriculture production; 1.2. ashes from energy production; 1.3. ashes from various manufacturing; 1.4. ashes from waste processing; 1.5. high carbon content pyrolysis products; 2. untreated waste and new products made from secondary raw materials: 2.1. waste from municipal waste biological treatment and landfills; 2.2. waste from industries; 3. new products made from secondary raw materials: 3.1. composite materials. Efficient solutions in environmental engineering may eliminate excessive amounts of waste and support innovation in the circular economy for sustainable future.

AB Marine/brackish elastic sediments replace freshwater peals in the stratigraphic column of many coastal lowland areas bordering the North Sea during the late Holocene. Radiocarbon dates are routinely used to provide a chronology for this shift. We examine the assumptions underpinning this approach. The results of investigations from 13 sites in the Rye area of Romney Marsh, southeast England, are reported. Dates from apparently gradational contacts of a highly humified, laterally persistent, peat layer range from 3170-2840 cal. yr BP to 1290-1050 cal. yr BP. Multiple inundations or prolonged gradual inundation are nevertheless rejected, as discrete post-peat bodies of sediment are absent and because peat growth appears to have slowed-down or ceased at many sites in advance of inundation. Additionally in the Rye area, sharp contacts are widespread and the pollen assemblages rarely indicate the occurrence of transitional plant communities. A review of the dating evidence from other coastal lowland regions reveals that multiple dating of the upper surface of peat beds invariably produces diachronous results. As a consequence time-transgressive processes feature prominently as causal mechanisms underlying this shift. However. many of the dating difficulties recognized in the Rye area appear to apply to other regions. We conclude that radiocarbon dates from the upper surface of peat layers should in most instances only be regarded as limiting ages for the deposition of the overlying clastic sediments. New chronologies need to be built without a priori assumptions as to the underlying processes. ideally through the direct dating of the elastic sediments.

AB The peat archives are one of the stratigraphic records revealing clearly physical, chemical and biological signals of human influence on the Earth System since the 1950s, at least. The presented study was aimed mainly to identify the level and origin of anthropogenic radionuclides such as (238,) (239,) Pu-240 in a Pb-210-dated peat profile derived from the Northern Ural, Russian Federation. As stated, the vertical variability of Pu-240/Pu-239 isotopic compositions reflects the nuclear weapons testing history with the maximum in the 1960s and small regional impact most likely of high-yielded tests in the 1950s as well as Chinese detonations in the 1970s. Peat accumulations rates were similar to those obtained in adjacent areas, whereas Pb-210 flux slightly exceeded the reference level established for adequate latitude belt.

AB To elucidate the environmental fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) once released into soil, sixteen humic acids (HAs) and one humin (HM) fractions were sequentially extracted from a peat soil, and sixteen priority PAHs in these humic substances (HSs) were analyzed. It was found that the total concentration of 16 PAHs (Sigma 16PAHs) increased evidently from HAl to HA16, and then dramatically reached the highest value in HM. The trend of Sigma 16PAHs in HAs relates to surface carbon and C-H/C-C contents, the bulk aliphatic carbon content and aliphaticity, as well as the condensation enhancement of carbon domains, which were derived from elemental composition, XPS, C-13 NMR, as well as thermal analyses. HM was identified to be the dominant sink of 16 PAHs retention in soil, due to its aliphatic carbon-rich chemical composition and the highly condensed physical makeup of its carbon domains. This study highlights the joint roles of the physical and chemical properties of HSs in retention of PAHs in soil and the associated mechanisms; the results are of significance for PAH-polluted soil risk assessment and remediation.

AB Flooded peat wetlands are an important global carbon pool and are relatively sensitive to frost degeneration due to global climate change. To study the dynamics of greenhouse gas (GHG) formations in the soil of a flooded peat marsh in response to freeze-thaw processes, CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes and gas concentrations at different soil depths were measured in a flooded peat marsh in Northeast China during a freeze-thaw period (from November 2004 to July 2005). During the freeze period, the gas concentrations underneath the frozen soil increased as the freeze developed until the soil completely froze in the root (15-35 cm) and peat (35-80 cm) layers. The highest gas concentrations accumulated in the gley layer (80-120 cm) when the greatest freeze depth formed. During the thaw period, the gas concentrations increased above the frozen layer (15-60 cm); in contrast, the gas concentrations underneath the frozen layer (60-120 cm) rapidly decreased when the bottom of the frozen layer began to thaw. GHG emissions from the marsh were not correlated with gas concentrations underneath the frozen layer during the freeze period but were significantly correlated with gas concentrations above the frozen layer (15-60 cm) during the thaw period. The study suggested that large changes in GHG formation dynamics occurred underneath the frost in the flooded peat marsh when the frost began to thaw due to gas physical diffusion within the peat layer.

AB We present new radiocarbon dates from a number of Holocene peat deposits along a north-south transect across the Yamal Peninsula. The samples were collected from frozen peat deposits with large ice wedges in: the northern tundra near Seyaha Settlement, in the Central Yamal Peninsula, the southern tundra in Shchuch'ya River valley at the Edem'yaha mouth, the southern part of the Yamal Peninsula, and the southern forest tundra near Labytnangi Town. C-14 dates of wood remains from the tundra in the Yamal Peninsula could be used to reconstruct a northern limit of forest during the Holocene Optimum. The wood layers at the bottom of the peat give evidence for immigration of trees further north beyond the present boundary. The first forest appearance in the Seyaha River valley area is dated about 9 ka BP according to the oldest peat date in the Seyaha cross section. This suggests that summer temperatures were higher than at present. Very fast accumulation of peat (around 5 m/ka: about 9-8 ka BP at Seyaha and about 7-6 ka BP at Shchuch'ya) also supports this observation.
   In contrast, oxygen isotope composition of Holocene syngenetic ice wedges from the area (delta(18)O= -19.1 to -20.3parts per thousand in the Seyaha cross-section and -17.3 to -20.3parts per thousand in the Shchuch'ya River) show that winter temperatures were significantly lower than presently, i.e. the climate during the Holocene Optimum was slightly more continental. The frozen peat near Labytnangi has thawed during the last 20 years, indicating global warming.

AB Rhizosphere bacteria were isolated from root tip segments of cucumber seedlings grown in a suppressive, slightly decomposed light-colored peat mix, a conducive, more decomposed dark-colored peat mix, and a suppressive dark peat mix amended with composted hardwood bark. The bacteria were identified by a gas chromatographic fatty acid methyl ester analysis. The total number of taxa recovered from a single root tip segment ranged from 9 to 18. No single taxon predominated on all root tip segments harvested from any of the mixes. The highest relative population density reached by a given taxon on any root tip segment was 45%. Hill's first and second diversity numbers, the modified Hill's ratio, and Hurlbert's rarefaction method, which were used as measures of species diversity, indicated that the organic matter decomposition level of the potting mixes did not affect bacterial species diversity. Bray-Curtis polar ordination and Dice resemblance functions, however, indicated that the organic matter decomposition level of a mix significantly influenced the composition of bacterial species in the rhizosphere. Pseudomonas spp. and other taxa capable of inducing suppression of pythium damping-off predominated in the suppressive mixes. These organisms were absent from the conducive mix, in which Arthrobacter and Bacillus spp. predominated. Although effective bacterial biocontrol agents were isolated from both the suppressive mixes and the conducive mix, the majority were isolated from the less decomposed suppressive mixes. Finally, the efficacy of strains was significantly greater in the slightly decomposed light peat mix than in the decomposed dark peat mix. Natural disease suppression within these mixes was associated with the organic matter decomposition level and the bacterial species compositions of the mixes.

AB The data presented were obtained at the first stage (1993-1999) of studies on evaluating the basic parameters of biological production in Russian terrestrial ecosystems in order to provide information for assessing and modeling the carbon budget of the entire terrestrial biota of the country. Stocks of phytomass (by fractions), coarse woody debris, and dead roots (underground necromass) were calculated by two independent methods, which yielded close results. The total amount of phytomass in Russian terrestrial ecosystems was estimated at 81 800 Tg (=10(12) g = million t) dry matter, or 39989 Tg carbon. Forest ecosystems comprise a greater part (82.1%) of live plant organic matter (here and below, comparisons are made with respect to the carbon content); natural grasslands and brushwoods account for 8.8%; the phytomass of wetlands (bogs and swamps), for 6.6%; and the phytomass of farmlands, for only 2.5%. Aboveground wood contains approximately two-thirds of the plant carbon (63.8%), and green parts contain 9.9%. For all classes of ecosystems, the proportion of underground phytomass averages 26.7% of the total amount, varying from 22.0% in forests to 57.1% in grasslands and brushwoods. The average phytomass density on lands covered with vegetation (1629.9 million hectares in Russia) is 5.02 kg/m(2) dry matter, or 2.45 kg C/m(2). The total amount of carbon in coarse woody debris is 4955 Tg C, and 9180 Tg C are in the underground necromass. In total, the vegetation of Russian terrestrial ecosystems (without litter) contains 54124 Tg carbon.

DE LATE HOLOCENE; MANGROVE HABITAT DEVELOPMENT; PHILIPPINES; POHNPEI
   ISLAND; SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; ZONATION
AB Using the sites of Pagbilao, the Philippines and Pohnpei Island, the Federated States of Micronesia, zonation and development process of mangrove habitats on tidal flats situated in the geomorphic environment excluding estuary, delta, and lagoon or backmarsh behind barrier or beach ridge were discussed from the viewpoint of geomorphology.
   Zonations of the mangrove forests were observed from seaward to landward in both areas. Most of the zones correspond with the variations of the ground level or deposit. Mangrove peat which has a thickness of about-2 meters was deposited in the main part of the mangrove habitats in both areas. On the other hand, some large Sonneratia alba were observed in the Rhizophora apiculata habitat on Pohnpei Island. The authors presumed that some of the large S. alba have survived by regeneration from fallen stems since the mangrove forest developed on the present site.
   The maximum depth of the mangrove peat layer reaches 1.7 meter below the present sea level in Pagbilao and over 2.5 meters at Pohnpei Island. The bottom of the mangrove peat was dated at about 2,000 y.B.P. in both areas by the radiocarbon method. The mangrove peat depositional areas have not been moved during the last 2,000 years. Therefore, the mangrove forests seem to have grown in the present sites since 2,000 y.B.P. and accumulated peat in connection with the subsequent sea-level rise.

AB Soils are sources of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) globally, but emissions from permafrost-affected soils have been considered negligible owing to nitrogen (N) limitation. Recent measurements of N2O emissions have challenged this view, showing that vegetated soils in permafrost regions are often small but evident sources of N2O during the growing season (similar to 30 mu g N2O-N m(-2) day(-1)). Moreover, barren or sparsely vegetated soils, common in harsh climates, can serve as substantial sources of N2O (similar to 455 mu g N2O-N m(-2) day(-1)), demonstrating the importance of permafrost-affected soils in Earth's N2O budget. In this Review, we discuss N2O fluxes from subarctic, Arctic, Antarctic and alpine permafrost regions, including areas that likely serve as sources (such as peatlands) and as sinks (wetlands, dry upland soils), and estimate global permafrost-affected soil N2O emissions from previously published fluxes. We outline the below-ground N cycle in permafrost regions and examine the environmental conditions influencing N2O dynamics. Climate-change-related impacts on permafrost ecosystems and how these impacts could alter N2O fluxes are reviewed, and an outlook on the major questions and research needs to better constrain the global impact of permafrost N2O emissions is provided.

AB Wetland restoration has been conducted worldwide due to the important ecological functions provided by wetlands. However, the global patterns of soil organic carbon (SOC) change following wetland restoration are not clear, which has limited the efficacy of the management of restored wetlands. In this study, we synthesized the results from 41 studies and carried out a meta-analysis to examine the SOC dynamics following wetland restoration and the underlying mechanisms. The SOC of restored wetlands was 13.8% (p = 0.017) higher than that of cultivated wetlands and 29.2% (p < 0.001) lower than that of natural wetlands. Wetland restoration facilitated SOC sequestration under certain conditions, including when the wetlands were restored via water supplementation, had seasonal hydrology in their natural status (before cultivation), were peatlands, occurred under a temperate climate, were restored for 6 to 10 years, or had been cultivated no longer than 15 years before restoration. Meanwhile, some conditions had negative effects on SOC sequestration, including wetlands under a tropical climate, those restored using a plantation approach, and those with a tidal hydrology after restoration. Model selection analysis suggested that the hydrological conditions of cultivated wetlands, soil depth, vegetation type, peat condition and restored age were important influential factors affecting SOC after wetland restoration, with the first 2 being the most important influential factors. Our results indicate that wetland restoration is inefficient in terms of SOC recovery and that wetland restoration to recover SOC is urgently needed and should be conducted more appropriately. The results of this study provide theoretical support for wetland management with the aim of SOC sequestration.

AB A pot culture experiment was undertaken under controlled conditions in the National Phytotron Facility to investigate the interactive effect of microbial inoculants blue-green algae (BGA), Azospirillum, phosphate-solubilizing bacterium (PSB) Pseudomonas striata, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (VAMF), and Azolla, individually and in combination with chemical fertilizers and/rock phosphate on the wetland rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar 'PNR 381'. The microbial inoculants-BGA, PSB, VAMF, and Azospirillum-positively interacted with one another, resulting in significant improvement in yield and nutritional parameters. Application of biofertilizers also substantially improved soil (peat) fertility status by increasing the nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and organic carbon content. The biofertilizer combination BGA + PSB + VAMF + Azospirillum was best for improved growth and yield traits, nutritional status of rice, and sustained soil (peat) fertility. Azolla, which is a highly competitive organism, suppressed the growth of the other four inoculants. The inclusion of VAMF and PSB was observed to significantly improve the zinc nutrition of the paddy and the P utilization of the applied rock phosphate. A basal dose of nitrogenous fertilizer was essential for deriving maximum benefits from applied inoculants, thereby underlying the supplementary/complementary role of biofertilizers in efficient nutrient management in agriculture.

AB The use of a biological cover for in situ control of gaseous sulfide emission from an anaerobic pond was investigated by a laboratory-scale experiment. The biological cover, constituting by a peat bed floating on the wastewater, caused a reduction of the H2S emission rate by 84.6%. The addition of Fe3+ (with FeCl3.) and plants (Juncus effusus L.) to the peat bed significantly improved the performance to reach a H2S removal of 95.5%. Despite the fluctuations in the sulfide concentration in the wastewater, the performance of the biological covers remained constant during the entire period of the study. The analysis of the different forms of sulfur accumulated in the peat beds allowed the understanding of the mechanisms involved in H2S removal. The high amount of sulfate demonstrated that the conditions were favorable to the biological oxidation of H2S. The addition of Fe3+ increased the formation of insoluble ferrous monosulfide (FeS) and pyrite (FeS2). The plants seemed to convert sulfate into elemental and organic sulfur.

   ESTUARY; MEAN HIGH WATER; LEVEL CHANGE; SOUTHWEST BRITAIN
AB Salt marshes, most now embanked, together with genetically related wetlands and high intertidal flats, make a major environmental contribution to the lowland coasts of Northwest Europe. They occur in many different contexts, but chiefly on open and barrier coasts and in estuaries and embayments, and range greatly in scale, from a modest total that measure hundreds of square kilometres in individual extent, to an enormous number each of an area no greater than tens to a few hundred hectares.
   These marshes and associated environments are under complex natural controls and experienced from the mid-Holocene onward human exploitation and, increasingly, interference. The main external controls are the sea-level, tidal and sediment-supply regimes. Intrinsic infuences are provided by the halophytic vegetation and sediment autocompaction. Upward sea-level movements and autocompaction combine to provide accomodation space within which marshes build upward. Field data and simulation modelling show that youthful mineralogenic marshes grow up rapidly and can mature within a few hundred years of inception. They consist of a vegetated platform dissected typically by extensive networks of blind-ended, branching tidal creeks and gullies. The how-resistant surface vegetation, shaping the combined wave-tide boundary layer on the platforms, both traps and binds tidally introduced mineral sediment, but also contributes an organic component of indigenous origin to the deposit. When sea-level becomes stable or falls, however, in response to century-millennial scale fluctuations, the organic sediment component becomes dominant and mineralogenic marshes are transformed into organogenic ones. Organogenic marshes normally display a considerable range of sub-environments which create much spatial variation in the peat facies which accumulate. At an advanced stage, domed raised bogs, rising significantly above the general landscape, may appear on the marshes. Because peat is such a porous and permeable sediment, and there is little or no tidal inundation, organogenic marshes in Northwest Europe typically lack surface channels for internal drainage.
   The stratigraphic sequences accumulated during the Holocene beneath coastal marshes and high tidal flats typically present an alternation on a vertical scale of decimetres to metres of silts (mineralogenic marshes, high intertidal mudflats) and peats (organogenic highest intertidal-supratidal marshes). Coastal barriers and some channels are represented by local accumulations of sand and/or gravel. The silts and peats form couplets which are generally considered to be related to fluctuations of sea-level about the general upward trend. Field investigations and modelling show that, in areas where marshes are mature, the upward change from an organogenic to a sequence of mineralogenic marshes (transgressive overlaps) is accompanied by the initiation and invasive development of a branching network of tidal creeks. These decay and infill during the reversal of the environmental sequence and the approach, expressed as a series of repressive overlaps, of the next set of peat-forming conditions. The operation of the continuous, progressive, irreversible and asymptotic process of sediment autocompaction exerts a major, secondary control on depositional regimes and marsh behaviour. A variety of local responses are consequently possible in an extensive marsh, even though the marsh may be everywhere in dynamic equilibrium with environmental factors. Autocompaction also strongly shapes the character of Holocene coastal sequences as now perceived, introducing significant stratigraphic distortions and displacements which, for the time being, limit the accuracy of sea-level curves and rates of sea-lever change based on dated intercalated peats.
   Prehistoric humans benefitted from the resources of coastal salt marshes, especially at the times when peat marshes begin to be transgressed. Feat domes not yet fully collapsed may have provided vantage points for seasonal ocupancy or even settlement from which the richer resource of the mineralogenic marshes developing on lower ground could be exploited. Increasing human interference on salt marshes over the last millennium, chiefly through wholesale land-claim and set-back, augmented by rising sea levels and continuing autocompaction, has led to a variety of poorly understood but generally deleterious effects in the lowland coastal zone. These include major changes to tidal and sedimentary regimes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predicted climate changings can affect hemi-boreal forests especially for soil conditions with low water-holding capacity and susceptibility to soil water deficits. In our study, species-specific sap flux, transpiration and water use efficiency of growth (WUE) were investigated at a mixed hemi-boreal forest ecosystems, especially during temporary moderate dry periods in the main growing season. Therefore, two representative forest sites with different drought susceptibility were selected in Northwest-Lithuania. The aim of our investigations was to identify the responsible factors influencing transpiration and WUE from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L. H. Karst.) and birch (silver birch: Betula pendula Roth. and downy birch: B. pubescens Ehrh.) during temporary drought incidents at a water-limited, oligitrophic sand dominated forest site and at a water saturated, mesoeutrophic organic peat forest site for the whole vegetation period and two moderate short-term drought incidents in 2016. During the dry periods Norway spruce trees exhibited lowest sap flux compared to Scot pine and birch while similarly showing highest WUE. Up-scaled to a virtual pure stand none of the species were differing in species specific transpiration. Thus, we found no evidence for extended drought sensitivity of Norway spruce at the water limited site during the first investigation year. Sap flux of Scots pine trees was more or less constantly high during the main growing season and the dry periods at both plots, while WUE was quite low during the "dry periods". Thus, we assume that Scots pine trees are less affected by temporarily drought events than Norway spruce. Birch trees exhibited significantly highest sap flux during dry periods at the water limited site whereas quite low WUE was not differing between sites. Thus, birch may compete with Scots pine trees at the study sites in terms of water consumption and growth in future.

AB Formulated sediments are recommended for use in toxicity tests to achieve standardized evaluations. However, the organic matter used in formulated sediments may differ qualitatively from that in natural sediments, which may lead to different chemical partition patterns and, hence, different toxicity effects. By deriving partition coefficients for organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon (KOC and KDOC, respectively) for eight pyrethroid insecticides from three formulated and five natural sediments, the authors characterized the differences between formulated and natural sediments in pesticide sorption. For all pyrethroids, the mean values of KOC and KDOC of formulated sediments were two to three, and three to 10 times smaller than those of natural sediments, respectively. The two formulated sediments containing -cellulose or Manitoba peat showed significantly (p<0.0001) smaller KOC and KDOC values than natural sediments based on statistical analyses, while the difference was not significant for the formulated sediment containing New Brunswick peat. The KOC values were closely correlated (p<0.001) with soot carbon content, while the amount of carboxylic or phenolic functional groups may have affected KDOC. Therefore, the source and quality of organic matter are likely the most important factors in formulated sediments and must be standardized to provide consistency in sediment toxicity tests. Environ.

AB Question: This paper compares published palynological studies from coastal swamps containing the same suite of species. We ask the following questions: (1) does succession follow the same pathways in different swamp systems, or (2) at different times? If not, (3) how variable are the patterns and (4) what are the likely driving factors?
   Location: Great Barrier Island, Northern New Zealand.
   Methods: Eighteen pollen profile diagrams were studied from four estuarine wetlands, ranging from mangroves to swamp forest. Recognition of a transition between vegetation stages was by subjective consideration of the relative abundances of pollen of key indicator species at different depths in the sedimentary sequence.
   Results: A linear sequence of vegetation communities beginning with mangroves and followed by estuarine marsh communities composed of Juncus kraussii, Leptocarpus similis and Baumea juncea was recognised in almost all pollen diagrams. Further transitions, from Baumea to a terrestrial system of Leptospermum shrubland or Cordyline/Dacrycarpus swamp forest, followed two main pathways associated with autogenic accumulation of peat and terrigenous sediment input respectively. At Kaitoke and Awana the marine/freshwater transition occurred before the arrival of humans on Great Barrier Island. At Whangapoua, increased sedimentation followed anthropogenic burning of adjacent forest, and this transition was faster and is still in progress.
   Conclusion: Palynology and current vegetation zonation patterns concur to demonstrate that the marine sedimentation phase of estuarine succession is predictable and linear. Baumea marks the transition to the freshwater phase, in which varied successional patterns are determined by interactions between hydrology, sediment input, and peat accumulation. Natural and human disturbances drive sedimentation rates, and interact with autogenic factors, to dictate vegetation transitions in these later stages. The intensive impact (mainly burning) during Polynesian times had a much greater effect on estuaries and swamps than the pre-Polynesian natural processes, greatly accelerating plant succession.

ID CONCRETE CARBONATION; PROFILES
AB The phenolphthalein indicator method, the pH of slurries method, X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are all commonly associated with evaluating the carbonation front depth in concrete. Recent research (using a closed chamber method) has indicated that stabilized peat is a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) (at least in the short term), as the binder takes in CO2 both from the atmosphere and any CO2 released by oxidized peat. Therefore, the application of carbonation depth techniques to stabilized peat are of interest and are explored in this paper for the first time as a precursor to developing a greater understanding of the carbonation process in this material. The carbonation fronts obtained by XRD, loss on ignition, and FTIR all arose at similar depths, as these methods all identify the depth at which the calcium carbonate concentration is elevated with respect to the baseline (i.e., the maximum advancement of the carbonation front). In contrast, the phenolphthalein method underestimated the carbonation front considerably. The pH of the stabilized peat slurries method gave the depth at which leaching of calcium hydroxide and calcium ions occurred, rather than a carbonation depth, and exceeds the depths determined from the other techniques. Advantages and disadvantages of all techniques are discussed.

AB The geochemistry of the REE (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, Yb, and Lu) is reviewed with supporting data from coals of North Asia. The 7189 samples from North Asia included in this study represent all coal ranks (lignites, sub bituminous coals, bituminous coals and anthracites) as well as coals formed under different geotectonic regimes and in different sedimentary conditions. These coals are characterized by higher contents of the REE as compared to the coal Clarke. The distribution characteristics and accumulations of the REE have been studied in several coal deposits and basins. Within some basins with the near-background average contents of the REE isolated coal beds enriched in lanthanides have been observed. In coal basins and deposits the relative enrichment in the lanthanides are observed in the fields or zones adjacent to the source area of the terrigenous material. Accumulation of high REE contents in coal deposits can be attributed to the presence of rocks in the source area containing high concentrations of REE and also alkaline or acidic volcanic ash contemporaneous with the peat accumulation in the basin. Transformation of volcanic ashes under the aggressive hydro-environment of a peat bog results in the mobilization and redeposition of the REE adjacent to the altered volcanic ashes (tonsteins) with the formation of high concentrations of REE in the coal beds. The formation of the REE anomalies may also be related to hydrothermal processes. The modes of occurrence of the REE change during the coalification process. Brown coals with a low degree of coalification are dominated by the organic modes of occurrence of the REE, whereas in hard coals and anthracites authigenic mineral forms dominate.

AB The Cs-137 activities in soil profiles and in the mycelia of four ectomycorrhizal fungi were studied in a Swedish forest in an attempt to understand the mechanisms governing the transfer and retention of Cs-137 in forest soil. The biomass of four species of fungi was determined and estimated to be 16 g m(-1) in a peat soil and 47-189 g m(-1) in non-peat soil to the depth of 10 cm. The vertical distribution was rather homogeneous for two species (Tylospora spp. and Piloderma fallax) and very superficial for Hydnellunt peckii. Most of the Cs-137 activity in mycelium of non-peat soils was found in the upper 5 cm. Transfer factors were quite high even for those species producing resupinate sporocarps. In the peat soil only approximately 0.3% of the total Cs-137 inventory in soil was found in the fungal mycelium. The corresponding values for non-peat soil were 1.3, 1.8 and 1.9%.

AB Peatland buffer zones with sedimentation ponds are established with the intention of capturing solids and nutrients liberated in drained forestry catchments. As noted in earlier fertilization experiments, added nitrogen (N) immediately increases nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in such buffers, and we expected the same to happen after disturbances in the catchment caused by clear-cutting, soil preparation, and ditch cleaning. We measured N2O fluxes, water table dynamics, and vegetation cover from a wetland one year before and two years after the clear-cut and buffer establishment. The low pre-harvest emissions did not increase, but N2O emissions from the sedimentation pond exceeded those from humic lakes with a high N load. In the soil profile, N2O concentrations were high, indicating a potential to produce N2O in the buffer. In one sub-site the soil N2O concentration was below the atmospheric level, which was in accordance with the high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The change in vegetation along the overland flow paths could be explained by a shift in the species thriving in wet conditions but not in those requiring higher nutrient levels. In spite of the apparent potential of soil to produce N2O, the fluxes to the atmosphere remained low. Transformation of N2O to unobserved N-2 may explain some of the low N emissions, together with the low concentrations entering the buffer.

AB Effective modeling of many hydrological and climatological processes requires accurate spatial characterization of soil moisture, often over large regions and across different spatial scales. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be sensitive to surface soil moisture, and is therefore a promising alternative to field data campaigns. However, the presence of spatially-variable vegetation and surface roughness also affect SAR backscatter. In this research, empirical models were developed to both predict soil moisture from SAR and assess the relationship between LiDAR-derived vegetation and surface conditions, and polarimetric SAR parameters in a vegetated peatland environment. Importantly, the low predictive strength of soil moisture models was only evident through a process of model cross-validation (bivariate regression R-2 ranged from 0.14 to 0.66 for fitted models and 0.05 to 0.41 for independently cross-validated models). The LiDAR-derived vegetation density was found to explain a large amount of variance in the SAR data, and models to predict soil moisture from SAR from only the least vegetated sites within the peatland demonstrated much higher predictive strength (R-2 = 0.11 to 0.71). Soil moisture within the vegetated and least-vegetated sites was not significantly different. Therefore, non vegetated areas may be useful as representative imaging locations for remotely monitoring surface moisture conditions in large peatland complexes with heterogeneous vegetation.

AB The influence of organic C quantity and quality on denitrification in riparian environments is poorly understood. We measured denitrification potential (DNP), organic matter, and several fractions of organic C in surface soils and subsurface sediments in a river riparian zone. Surface soils in conifer forest peat, mixed forest, and marsh sites had similar DNP, although mean organic matter ranged from 9.4% (marsh) to 19.6% (mixed forest) and 36.6% (peat). These soils also differed widely in organic C, water-extractable C, and anaerobic mineralizable C. Mean DNP in peat at depths of 0.8 to 1.4 m was four times lower than in the surface peat. Mean organic matter and organic C were significantly greater in the deep peat than at the surface, whereas the other C fractions were similar. Mean organic matter content of buried channel sediments at depths of 2 to 3 m was 3.6%; however, mean DNP was 75 to 80 times lower than in the surface mixed forest and marsh soils. When the three surface soil sites were considered separately, anaerobic mineralizable C showed the highest correlation with DNP in the marsh soils (r = 0.87) and the conifer peat soil (r = 0.82). Water-extractable C was also highly correlated with DNP in the marsh soils (r = 0.81). Correlations between DNP and either organic matter or the three C fractions were not significant in the deep peat, whereas the former channel sediments showed a significant relationship between DNP and both organic matter (r = 0.81) and water-extractable C (r = 0.81). These results show that C quantity and quality influence DNP, but no single index was a good predictor for all soil types.

AB To achieve an optimal time-control for a late Subboreal to early Subatlantic peat sequence from Pancavska Louka in the Czech Republic, different strategies are applied to convert a series of radiocarbon dates into a calendar time-scale. The methods of selection and preparation of the samples for AMS C-14 dating are presented. The results of calibrating single radiocarbon dates are compared with a C-14 wiggle-match strategy. As the accumulation rate of the peat was not constant, the concentrations of arboreal pollen are used to estimate the accumulation rate changes and to correct for these changes. The resulting time-control represents the best solution for this peat sequence with the methods currently available. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The chemical composition during baseflow was used to elucidate the fundamental processes controlling longitudinal and seasonal patterns of stream acidity in Yellow Creek, a chronically acidic headwater (pH range 3.7-4.2) on the Appalachian Plateau in northeastern West Virginia. Sulfate concentrations controlled the variability of stream acidity within the Yellow Creek catchment. Decreases in stream free H+ acidity with decreasing elevation likely resulted from SO42- retention in riparian wetland areas as well as spatial variation in dominant tree species. Seasonal variations in free H+ and inorganic monomeric aluminum (Aln+) concentrations appeared related to seasonal fluctuations in baseflow discharge which was controlled by vegetative activity. Baseflow stream discharge, as well as H+ and Aln+ acidity, gradually declined during the growing season (June through October), likely reflecting microbial SO42- reduction in saturated anaerobic environments within riparian wetlands. A marked pulse of stream H+, Aln+, and SO(4)(2-)coincided with an abrupt increase in baseflow discharge resulting from the cessation of transpiration after leaf-fall in November. This seasonal pattern suggests that autumn may be a critical period for eastern brook trout in streams draining wetlands on the Appalachian Plateau.

AB A peat deposit on Ellesmere Island(1), Nunavut, Canada, allows a unique glimpse of the Early Pliocene terrestrial biota north of the Arctic Circle. The peat accumulated in a beaver pond surrounded by boreal larch forest near regional tree line(2) in coastal hills close to the Arctic Ocean. The ecological affinities of the plant and beetle remains(3) contained in the peat indicate that winter temperatures on Ellesmere Island were nearly 15degreesC higher and summer temperatures 10degreesC higher than they are today. Here we show that the mammalian remains buried in the peat represent mainly taxa of Eurasiatic zoogeographic and phyletic affinities, including the first North American occurrence of a meline badger (Arctomeles). This deposit contains direct evidence of the composition of an Early Pliocene (4-5 million years ago) arctic mammalian fauna during an active period of interchange between Asia and North America.

ID LINE DESIGN
AB The main objective of the research presented in this paper was to develop a new philosophy for the design of a product family (PF) and its assembly system. Most methodologies usually do not consider the interactions between those two design processes. Moreover, most "assembly-centered" concurrent engineering (CE) approaches do not deal with PFs. A research project, called CISAL, was initiated in Belgium in the late nineties to tackle this problem. The proposed tool is intended to be applicable to PFs and hybrid assembly lines (presenting manual, robotic and automated operations). It is subdivided into three interacting main modules: preliminary design for assembly (DFA) and assembly planning (AP); detailed DFA and AP; line layout. The whole methodology is articulated around the functional entities (FEns), resulting from a first-order decomposition of the PF and aiming at reducing the complexity inherent to the design of multivariant products. All tools presented take this decomposition into account and treat design issues related to each FEn separately, considering the PF as an assembly of FEns. This paper presents the framework of CISAL, and the underlying methodology is illustrated on an industrial case study.

AB Experiments with various traffic regimes in grassland (no traffic, light and medium tractor with two mechanisation lines; forage harvester and two-step harvesting) and three fertilization levels (N 120, 180, 240 kg ha(-1)) were carried out in five fields on sandy soils and peat soils in Bodo, northern Norway. Increased tractor weight caused significant decrease in yields on the peat soils with both mechanisation lines. When the peat soils were exposed to the light tractor treatments, DM yields increased significantly as the fertilization level rose from N 120 kg ha(-1) to N 180 kg ha(-1), but not for further increase to N 240 kg ha(-1). With the medium tractor treatments, there was no significant yield increase from N 120 kg ha(-1) to N 180 kg ha(-1), but a further increase to N 240 kg ha(-1) gave significantly higher yields. Use of lighter machines on peat soils may therefore lead to reduced fertilizer costs for farmers, and decrease the risk of leaching from the soil. On the sandy soils, yields were significantly lower at the medium tractor treatment with two-step harvest compared to no traffic. With the exception of decreased air-filled porosity at 1-5 cm depth of the peat soils no significant change in soil physical properties of the plough layer were measured. Therefore, the negative impact of traffic on plant growth was more likely due to plant injury than impaired soil conditions.

AB Carbon translocation was studied in two populations of two closely related, stoloniferous Vaccinium species; the sub-arctic V. microcarpum and the boreo-memoral V. oxycoccos, both growing in nutrient-poor bogs. The youngest tip of the stolen was labelled using pattern studied after four weeks of growth. The sub-arctic plants showed more acropetal translocation than the boreal plants, indicating that the stolen apex acts as a strong sink. This may reflect the larger need for this species to invest in lateral growth to be able to complete its life-cycle in the short growing season.
   The cutting-off of the apical region did not affect carbon translocation. The reason for this might be that the rapidly developing leaves just behind the apex, and nor the apex itself, are the strongest carbon sinks. Alternatively, the high respiration rate of the apex might mask the carbon transported there.
   The sub-arctic plants translocated relatively more carbon to leaves than to stolons than did the boreal plants. This might reflect the stronger need for the subarctic species to save carbon in a more readily available form to efficiently utilize the more restricted periods of growth in its climatically harsher environment.

AB The study was conducted to characterize previously unexplored wetland vegetation in lower montane areas of the Himalaya (1597-2538 m above sea level) of Jigme Dorji National Park, Gasa District, Northern Bhutan. A random quadrat sampling method was employed to assess percent plant cover and environmental data were collected following standard procedures. Cluster and indicator species analyses using plant cover data were used to define the species composition of plant communities. Differences in community composition along gradients of elevation, slope, soil pH, available phosphorus, and peat/soil depth were analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The wetlands supported 120 vascular plant species from 84 genera and 51 families. Analyses identified four plant communities, I to IV, each named from the three most prominent species. The key indicator species of four plant communities,Acorus calamus, Carex diandra, Equisetum ramosissimum, andCarex capillacea, dominate shallow fresh marsh, seasonally flooded basin of flat, fresh water meadow, and poor fen, respectively. Elevation and soil phosphorus were the most important environmental variables in explaining the variation in wetland vegetation. The findings can be used to support the work of conservation agencies to identify and conserve these plant communities and their habitats in the Himalaya.

AB Adequate soil nutrients and water supply are critical to vegetation establishment and creation of sustainable ecosystems in post-disturbed mining sites. This study investigated effects of various amendments and capping techniques on soil quality and moisture distribution on a reclaimed waste rock pile at the Key Lake uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Soil profiles were reconstructed in 2010 using locally available sandy glacial materials to create soil covers of 1 m thickness. The reclamation treatments consisted of a Control plot, commercial peat (Peat), a local lake sediment (Sediment), underlying flax straw (Straw), mulched forest floor and Ae (LFH), fertilizer (NPK), manure pellets (Pellets), and a demonstration plot (Demo) comprised of Sediment, LFH and Pellets. Soil amendments were applied by various techniques as broadcast, surface incorporation, below the surface or surface mounding. Annual plot monitoring was conducted from 2011 to 2013 and soil samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), available nutrients, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and regulated metals. Volumetric moisture contents were measured periodically to examine soil moisture response to growing-season precipitation. In 2013, the topsoil of the Control plot was slightly acidic (pH of 6.3) while the Sediment and Demo plots had the lowest pH of 4.0. The EC and SAR values were below 1.0 in all treatment plots. The highest levels of available N, TN, TOC and CEC were in the Sediment and Demo plots, followed by the Peat. The concentration of arsenic exceeded the regulatory limit by 3.4- and 2.6-fold in the Sediment and Demo topsoil, respectively, while concentrations of other metals were below the limits in all treatment plots. The Sediment and Demo treatments were most effective in retaining water in the topsoil, while application of soil amendment by mounding enhanced infiltration and water transmission in the profile. In terms of soil fertility and moisture storage, the combination of organic amendments in multi-layers plus surface mounding, as in the Demo plot, is the most promising capping technique for restoring soil health, vegetative cover and ecosystem functions on the waste rock pile.

AB One of the most important, but also one of the most tedious, problems confronting the mineral industries in dealing with sulfides and graphite is estimating the depth of a buried object from self-potential anomalies. A peat layer has been encountered in the subsurface Holocene sediments of the eastern part of the Nile delta at depths range from 7 to 13 meters. The maximum thickness of the peat (3m) has been recorded in the southern part of Mansoura city, and it decreases gradually in a configuration parallel to the Damietta branch of the Nile. To elucidate the peat layer in terms of depth and thickness, a self-potential survey was carried out at Mansoura city, Nile Delta of Egypt, in terms of eight profiles. Interpretation of the data was performed through the correction and processing using derivative analysis of higher orders by means of an algorithm developed by the authors. Depth, shape factor, and the optimum order of the regional component are determined. A rough estimation of the relief of the peat layer was derived. Based on the results, the depth to the peat layer varies from 11.8 up to 13.1 meters, which correlates very well with the available information and the lithological data in the area.

AB Soil type is an important factor defining terrestrial ecosystems and plays a major role for the movement of solutes and cycling of nutrients and carbon. This paper focuses on the effect of peat complex dual-porosity structure on nitrate reduction, with the main objective to show how this process is controlled by pore-scale mass transfer and exchange of nitrate between mobile and immobile pore fractions. A mesocosm experiment was conducted where input solutions of bromide (Br-) and nitrate (NO3 (-)) were continuously supplied downward into 40 cm depth of peat. Br- and NO3 (-) breakthrough curves were used to constrain transport parameters and nitrate reduction rates in the peat depth profile. The vertical distribution of potential nitrate reduction rates were compared with depth distributions of partitioning mobile-immobile pores and the exchange coefficient between the pores. The results showed that an increase of immobile pore fractions with depth increases the common interface surface area between mobile and immobile pores which constitutes to a more pronounced exchange between the two transport domains and enhances the nitrate reduction. Hence, the pore structure with mobile-immobile pore fractions and exchange rate of solutes between mobile and immobile phases play a major role in nitrate reduction in peat soils.

AB DRAINMOD 6.1 was evaluated for hydrological simulation of two drained (1.0m drain depth, 20m spacing) peat extraction areas in Northern Finland. Water table depth (WTD) and drainage outflow were recorded continuously during two years, and the data were used for model calibration and validation. Despite some under- and overestimation of certain events, WTD fluctuations simulated quite accurately, whereas the model did not simulate drainage outflow well compared to observed data, especially for daily runoff. Mean absolute error (MAE) was 11.29 and 9.09cm and Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (EF) was 0.64 and 0.62 for both study sites during the validation period, indicating good agreement between predicted and observed WTD. These results demonstrate that DRAINMOD 6.1 can satisfactorily simulate the WTD fluctuations in peat extraction areas in the cold climate of northern Finland, but further studies are needed to improve the model to better include frozen condition and peat extraction activities.

AB Twenty channel coal samples were collected and examined along 15 km throughout the outcrops of coal bearing shale horizon in the middle part of the Abu Thora Formation in Sinai. The coal seam varies in thickness between 20 cm and 72 cm (averaging 55 cm). Fuel analysis shows the shaly coal facies is three times more dominant than the coal facies in the studied area. The type of coal is very low-grade with ash contents (d.b.; dry-base) of about 55% which is a poor quality for industrial use. The high ash content reflects the planner mire of the rheotrophic system during peat accumulation. Coalification paleo-temperature was relatively high of averaging 108.9 degrees C which could be attributed to additional thermal heating by the Jurassic sill capping the Abu Thora Formation especially within the western area of Gebel Hazbar. The studied coal is classified as medium rank ortho-bituminous based on the average vitrinite reflectance, gross calorific values, volatile matter, and fixed carbon. Vitrinite genesis and exinite genesis during developments of coal macerals are the two main pathways of the studied coal samples that are attributed to well preserved vascular plants under dominant anoxic waterlogged swampy conditions.

AB The dynamic properties of peat have been identified as major source of uncertainty in the evaluation of seismic hazards throughout the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in northern California. This paper summarizes the results of a laboratory study of the dynamic properties of a layer of peaty organic soil underlying the south levee on Sherman Island near the western side of the delta. Conventional Shelby tube sampling procedures were able to obtain high-quality samples because of the compactness of this peat layer, located between depths of 9 and 16 m. The samples tested were very fibrous and had ash contents of 35-56%. Staged cyclic triaxial loading was used to measure the stress-strain behavior of several specimens under cyclic shear strains ranging from about 0.0005% to 10%. Other tests included piezo-ceramic bender element tests to measure the shear wave velocity of specimens within the triaxial device, and undrained monotonic triaxial compression and extension tests. The effects of loading frequency, cyclic degradation, consolidation stress history, and structural anisotropy are evaluated. The resulting modulus reduction and damping relationships for the Sherman Island peat are compared with published results for other peats, solid waste materials, and mineral soils.

TI Comparing Methods for Measuring Water Retention of Peat Near Permanent
   Wilting Point
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANIC SOILS; PRESSURE PLATES; ERRORS
AB Peat soils shrink and become very hydrophobic when dried. Both properties may cause inaccuracies when applying laboratory methods for soil hydraulic properties that have been developed and tested for mineral soils. This study aimed to compare different methods for the determination of the water retention of peat soils near permanent wilting point (pF 3.5 to 4.2). Three common methods were tested: two pressure apparatus (ceramic plate [Soilmoisture] vs. membrane [Eijkelkamp] and a dew-point potentiameter (WP4C, Decagon Devices, Inc.), which is based on the equilibrium of soil water potential with air humidity. We used both field-moist peat samples and samples that had been rewetted after oven-drying. We found that there was no systematic difference between the two pressure apparatus. Low moisture variability among replicates and dew-point potentiameter measurements that indicated a drainage to pF 4.2 support the use of pressure apparatus for the determination of water retention near permanent wilting point. Despite a rewetting time of 2 wk including periodic mixing, rewetted oven-dried samples showed lower soil moistures at pF 3.5 and 4.2 than field-moist ones. This severe and long-lasting hysteresis effect was strongest for less decomposed peat samples. Thus, field-moist samples should be used. This makes the classical dew-point potentiameter measurement protocol, which is based on defined water additions to oven-dried samples, unsuitable for peat samples.

AB The oribatid mites Oppiella nova, Tectocepheus velatus and Nothrus silvestris and the enchytraeid worm Cognettia sphagnetorum are four common animal species in boreal forest soils. According to the literature, they respond differently to clear-cutting of forest stands. O. nova responds with population decreases, T. velatus and N. silvestris with small changes and C. sphagnetorum with population increases. We hypothesised that the presence/absence of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi is a major factor in explaining these reactions. The population responses of these soil animals to inoculation of five species of EM fungi growing in symbiosis with their host tree (Pinus sylvestris L) and one saprotrophic fungus. Hypholoma capnoides, growing on wood were tested in pot microcosms with artificial soil (peat and vermiculite) for 70-84 days. Additionally, plants without inoculation of EM fungi, plants growing in forest soil (FS) and plant-free peat and vermiculite (PV) were included. O. nova increased significantly in abundance in the treatments with the EM fungi Suillus variegatus and Paxillus involutus, but not in the other treatments. T velatus increased significantly in abundance in FS, but declined in most of the other treatments, and N. silvestris showed a similar, albeit not significant, response. C. sphagnetorum did not increase in abundance in any of the treatments with EM fungi but increased its abundance four times in both FS and PV. The results show that the fungivore O. nova preferentially feeds on certain EM fungi, especially S. variegatus, whereas the EM fungus Piloderma fallax and the saprotrophic H. capnoides are not preferred. In contrast, C sphagnetorum is restricted in its population growth by the EM fungi studied, and this dominant microbi-detritivore is clearly favoured by the absence of EM fungi.

AB Introduction: Following oil sands mining in Alberta, Canada, the main land management goal is to establish a functioning boreal forest ecosystem, including the understory plant community. One of the challenges with restoring the understory is the presence of non-native species that compete with desirable native species for resources. In a greenhouse experiment, we studied the growth of two native understory species (Galium boreale and Vicia americana) and a non-native invasive species (Matricaria perforata) grown with either intra- or interspecific neighbors across three common land reclamation soils and a nitrogen fertilizer treatment.
   Results: When grown by itself, V. americana aboveground biomass did not differ among soil or fertilizer treatments, likely due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Growth of M. perforata was directly related to soil nitrogen, and it had the greatest increase in biomass with fertilization. Growth and biomass of G. boreale was less than the other species, and it had the highest mortality in the nitrogen-poor soil. When grown together, the proportional biomass of M. perforata and V. americana varied with soil treatment such that M. perforata was dominant in the high-nitrogen forest floor-mineral mix treatment while V. americana was dominant in the low-nitrogen peat-mineral mix.
   Conclusions: Operationally, care should be taken when applying fertilizer to reclamation areas, as it may have an unwanted positive effect on growth for undesirable non-native plants at the expense of native species. In terms of seed mixtures, V. americana may be a good option for low inorganic nitrogen resource soils and G. boreale for high nitrogen resource soils.

AB The accumulation and preservation of peat soils in Everglades freshwater marshes and mangrove swamps is an essential process in the ecological functioning of these ecosystems. Human intervention and climate change have modified nutrient dynamics and hydroperiod in the Everglades and peat loss due to such anthropogenic activities is evident. However, not much is known on the molecular level regarding the biogeochemical characteristics, which allow peat to be preserved in the Everglades. Lipid biomarkers trapped within or bound to humic-type structures can provide important geochemical information regarding the origin and microbial transformation of OM in peat. Four lipid fractions obtained from a Cladium peat, namely the freely extractable fraction and those associated with humin, humic acid, and fulvic acid fractions, showed clear differences in their molecular distribution suggesting different OM sources and structural and diagenetic states of the source material. Both, higher plant derived and microbial lipids were found in association with these humic-type substances. Most biomarker distributions suggest an increment in the microbial/terrestrial lipid ratio from the free to humin to humic to fulvic fractions. Microbial reworking of lipids, and the incorporation of microbial biomarkers into the humic-type fractions was evident, as well as the preservation of diagenetic byproducts. The lipid distribution associated with the fulvic acids suggests a high degree of microbial reworking for this fraction. Evidence for this 3D structure was obtained through the presence of the relatively high abundance of alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acids and phenolic and benzenecarboxylic compounds. The increment in structural complexity of the phenolic and benzencarboxylic compounds in combination with the reduction in the carbon chain length of the dicarboxylic acids from the free to fulvic fraction suggests the latter to be structurally the most stable, compacted and diagenetically altered substrate. This analytical approach can now be applied to peat samples from other areas within the Everglades ecosystem, affected differently by human intervention with the aim to assess changes in organic matter preservation.

AB The investigation assessed the performance of rubber seedlings on different soilless media and soil-based medium. The treatments consisted of three soilless media codded M1, M2, M3 and soil-based medium M4 as a control. The highest rates of seedling growth and biomass yield were recorded in the soilless medium with 10% burned rice husk (BRH), 30% peat moss and 15% vermiculite (coded as M1) with noticeable effect in root morphological traits, while the pH and EC were 6.5 and 2.3 mu S/m, respectively. Nitrogen was apparent in the M1 2.59, M2 3.03, M3 2.78 while 1.82 in M4 was recorded in the soil-based medium. Similarly, the phosphorus was noticed in M1 0.23, M2 0.26, M3 0.33, and in M4 0.13. Plant roots of rubber seedlings grown in the M1 was significantly different from the seedlings grown in M2 and M3 and M4. The least amount (5%) urea-N used was used in the best medium (M1). This amount of nitrogen could be maintained to reduce fertilizer usage. These results showed that the soilless medium that contains 10% BRH with 5% urea-N could greatly increase the growth of rubber seedlings.

AB This study examines the early stages of clastic deposition above the main coal seam in the Most Basin (Ohre Rift, NW Czech Republic). Eight drill cores were subjected to chemical analysis by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and cation exchange capacity determination (CEC) to corroborate the local chemostratigraphic scheme and extend its temporal and spatial ranges. Additionally, four drill cores were subjected to palaeomagnetic polarity analysis for magnetostratigraphic dating, and two cores were subjected to the frequency analysis of variations in elemental compositions to obtain cyclostratigraphic patterns and more detailed insight into depositional dynamics. We demonstrate that a local lake was present in the Bilina area from the end of palaeomagnetic chron C5Er through chron C5En (18.524-18.056 Ma according to the Astronomically Tuned Neogene Time Scale 2012) to the beginning of the C5Dr chrons. This finding extends the previous age models for the Most Formation by more than 0.5 My (18.6 to 17.9 Ma). The chemostratigraphic scheme, which is based on variations in the concentrations of K and the values of CEC, was successfully extended from the basin centre to its north-east periphery, which reflects the basin-wide environmental changes that terminated the peat accumulation (coal formation) in the basin. The basin-wide lacustrine body formed by the coalescence of local lakes and the flooding of the remaining peatlands ca. 17.8 Ma (during C5Dn), which is coeval with the substantial reduction of the Antarctic ice sheet prior to the onset of the Miocene climatic optimum (MCO). The Most Basin deposits are the most detailed (with respect to temporal resolution) continental sedimentary archive of the time period preceding the MCO that have not been described to date.

AB 1. Functional traits mechanistically capture plant responses to environmental gradients as well as plant effects on ecosystem functioning. Yet most trait-based theory stems from terrestrial systems and extension to other habitats can provide new insights.
   2. Wetlands differ from terrestrial systems in conditions (e.g. soil water saturation, anoxia, pH extremes), plant adaptations (e.g. aerenchyma, clonality, ubiquity of bryophytes) and important processes (e.g. denitrification, peat accumulation, methane emission). Wetland plant adaptations and trait (co-)variation can be situated along major plant trait trade-off axes (e.g. the resource economics spectrum), but soil saturation represents a complex stress gradient beyond a simple extension of commonly studied water availability gradients.
   3. Traits that affect ecosystem functioning overlap with patterns in terrestrial systems. But wetland-specific traits that mediate plant effects on soil redox conditions, microbial communities and on water flow, as well as trait spectra of mosses, vary among wetland types.
   4. Synthesis. With increasing availability of quantitative plant traits a trait-based ecology of wetlands is emerging, with the potential to advance process-based understanding and prediction. We provide an interactive cause-and-effect framework that may guide research efforts to disentangle the multiple interacting processes involved in scaling from environmental conditions to ecosystem functioning via plant communities.

A horizon ranging in thickness between 75 and 100 cm with elevated concentrations of Ni, Zn, Bi, and Se is identified as a result of comprehensive studies. Magnetite and carbon spherules, as well as native iron found at the bottom of the horizon suggest an impact event that occurred about 5500 years ago. For the first time, peat deposits are a target of paleomagnetic research. Distinct inclination variations of the remanent magnetization vector are established in the horizon at a depth of 50 to 75 cm, which corresponds in time to the "Etrussia" geomagnetic excursion (2500 years ago).

AB Late Holocene deforestation and peat formation in the Charlevoix highlands: Onset of the subalpine and alpine belts. Fire history based on C-14 ages of soil charcoal in the Charlevoix highlands was reconstructed for the late Holocene. The subalpine and alpine belts developed after 3000 BP. Fire occurred sporadically and contributed to forest fragmentation and reduction in tree regeneration likely in relation to climate deterioration. The subalpine and alpine vegetation is thus a response to ecological changes induced by recurrent fires, rather than a direct response to a climatic gradient associated with topography. Differences found in highland vegetation (forested or open) at similar altitudes resulted from differential fire influence among sites. Feat formation on slopes started after 1250 BP and intensified after 600 BP. The delay between fire occurrence and peat formation indicates that peat actually started to accumulate when a general trend toward climate cooling occurred after the Little Climatic Optimum period, a thousand years ago. In spite of this delay, it is likely that shallow ombrotrophic peat formed over steep slopes in reponse to postfire forest opening on the highlands.

AB The production of methylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative neurotoxin, in freshwater systems is primarily driven by naturally occurring sulfate reducing bacteria in anoxic sediment and waters. This research used laboratory microcosms to examine the influence of sulfate on MeHg production and partitioning in sulfate-impacted freshwater estuary sediment. A laboratory sulfate addition experiment exposed 20 cm diameter intact sediment cores with varying organic carbon content to sulfate concentrations in the overlying water ranging from 5 to 50 mg L (1). Results from the 6 month incubation suggest that net MeHg production in sediment from open-water areas of the St. Louis River Estuary was not directly related to overlying water sulfate. Mercury mobility, as indicated by porewater concentrations, appeared to be related to the quantity of organic carbon and sulfur in sediment. Laboratory flux estimates were consistent with porewater concentrations and provided a means to compare diffusion-driven MeHg loading from sediment to MeHg loading from upstream sources.

AB Sequence stratigraphy and coal cycles based on accommodation trends were investigated in the coal-bearing Lower Cretaceous Mannville Group in the Lloydminster heavy oil field, eastern Alberta. The study area is in a low accommodation setting on the cratonic margin of the Western Canada sedimentary basin. Geophysical log correlation of coal seams, shore-face facies, and the identification of incised valleys has produced a sequence-stratigraphic framework for petrographic data from 3 cored and 115 geophysical-logged wells. Maceral analysis, telovitrinite reflectance, and fluorescence measurements were taken from a total of 206 samples. Three terrestrial depositional environments were interpreted from the petrographic data: ombrotrophic mire coal, limnotelmatic mire coal, and carbonaceous shale horizons. Accommodation-based coal (wetting- and drying-upward) cycles represent trends in depositional environment shifts, and these cycles were used to investigate the development and preservation of the coal seams across the study area.
   The low-accommodation strata are characterized by a high-frequency occurrence of significant surfaces, coal seam splitting, paleosol, and incised-valley development. Three sequence boundary unconformities are identified in only 20 m (66 ft) of strata. Coal cycle correlations illustrate that each coal seam in this study area was not produced by a single peat-accumulation episode but as an amalgamation of a series of depositional events. Complex relations between the Cummings and Lloyd-minster coal seams are caused by the lateral fragmentation of strata resulting from the removal of sediment by subaerial erosion or periods of nondeposition. Syndepositional faulting of the underlying basement rock changed local accommodation space and increased the complexity of the coal cycle development.
   This study represents a low-accommodation example from a spectrum of stratigraphic studies that have been used to establish a terrestrial sequence-stratigraphic model. The frequency of changes in coal seam quality is an important control on methane distribution within coalbed methane reservoirs and resource calculations in coal mining. A depositional model based on the coal cycle correlations, as shown by this study, can provide coal quality prediction for coalbed methane exploration, reservoir completions, and coal mining.

AB The present study examined the modulatory effects of natural fiber substrates (agave fiber, coconut fiber and peat moss) and synthetic alternatives (capillary mat and cellulose sponge) on the nutritive and phytochemical composition of select microgreens species (coriander, kohlrabi and pak choi) grown in a controlled environment. Polyphenols were analyzed by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS, major carotenoids by HPLC-DAD, and macro-minerals by ion chromatography. Microgreens grown on peat moss had outstanding fresh and dry yield but low dry matter content. Natural fiber substrates increased nitrate and overall macro-mineral concentrations in microgreens compared to synthetic substrates. The concentrations of chlorophylls, carotenoids and ascorbate were influenced primarily by species. On the contrary, variability in polyphenols content was wider between substrates than species. Out of twenty phenolic compounds identified, chlorogenic acid and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside were most abundant. Hydroxycinnamic acids and their derivatives accounted for 49.8% of mean phenolic content across species, flavonol glycosides for 48.4% and flavone glycosides for 1.8%. Peat moss provided optimal physicochemical conditions that enhanced microgreens growth rate and biomass production at the expense of phenolic content. In this respect, the application of controlled stress (eustress) on microgreens growing on peat moss warrants investigation as a means of enhancing phytochemical composition without substantial compromise in crop performance and production turnover. Finally, nitrate deprivation practices should be considered for microgreens grown on natural fiber substrates in order to minimize consumer exposure to nitrate.

AB Mor, slightly decomposed peat and highly decomposed peat, two soil types of each, were incubated for 154 days in the laboratory at +15 degrees C with and without enchytraeid worms, which functionally are the most influential faunal group in boreal forests. We quantified the release rates of organic and inorganic nitrogen (N) in dissolved and extractable forms from decomposing organic matter and explored the effects of enchytraeid worms on the release rates. About 80% of the dissolved N was released in the form of NH4+-N, except in mor without worms and in slightly decomposed peat with and without worms, where the net release from soil solution was in the form of dissolved organic N (DON). The majority of DON was in the high molecular weight fraction. In the presence of worms, the mineralization rate of N was highest in mor and in the absence of worms in highly decomposed peat. The large initial DON pool may explain the high mineralization rate in highly decomposed peat. The changes in the soil-solution N pool were small compared to the changes in extractable N pool which emphasizes the importance of the adsorbed N in soil N dynamics. Because N release through decomposition is the major component of N balance in forested catchments, the results of the study can be used for improving models of catchment scale N dynamics

AB Northern peatland methane (CH4) budgets are important for global CH4 emissions. This study aims to determine the ecosystem CH4 budget and specifically to quantify the importance of Phalaris arundinacea by using different chamber techniques in a temperate wetland. Annually, roughly 70 +/- 35% of ecosystem CH4 emissions were plant-mediated, but data show no evidence of significant diurnal variations related to convective gas flow regardless of season or plant growth stages. Therefore, despite a high percentage of arenchyma, P. arundinacea-mediated CH4 transport is interpreted to be predominantly passive. Thus, diurnal variations are less important in contrast to wetland vascular plants facilitating convective gas flow. Despite of plant-dominant CH4 transport, net CH4 fluxes were low (-aEuro parts per thousand 0.005-0.016 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and annually less than 1% of the annual C-CO2 assimilation. This is considered a result of an effective root zone oxygenation resulting in increased CH4 oxidation in the rhizosphere at high water levels. This study shows that although CH4, having a global warming potential 25 times greater than CO2, is emitted from this P. arundinacea wetland, less than 9% of the C sequestered counterbalances the CH4 emissions to the atmosphere. It is concluded that P. arundinacea-dominant wetlands are an attractive C-sequestration ecosystem.

AB Changes in the composition of organic matter in the peat horizon of peaty podzolic-gley soils upon their artificial drainage were studied, and a minor increase in the share of humic acids associated with the transformation of organic matter was found. Drainage decreases the content of carbohydrates in the fractions of humus acids. The humification index of peat is more fitted with the degree of decomposition of peat than the C-ha/C-total value and can be used for the evaluation of the humus status of peaty soils.

AB The microbial community structure of two biofilters used for the oxidation of methane and organic trace gases generated in landfills was analysed by phospholipid fatty acid composition. Community structure varied with biofilter depth, reflecting varying conditions of substrate supply as well as of organic carbon content, nutrient status and osmotic stress determined by the different materials used for the individual biofilter layers. Both biofilters were dominated by type 11 methanotrophs. In the biofilter charged with landfill gas containing significant amounts of trace organics, fatty acid 18: 1 omega7c constituted 87% of the methanotrophic PLFA, while the recognised signature fatty acids 16: 1omega8 and 18: 1omega8, which were well represented in the other biofilter, were entirely absent. This indicates the development of a highly specific methanotrophic population, presumably as a result of the adaption to continuous organic trace gas exposure.

AB The vegetation of the high-Andean cushion-plant peatlands is mainly characterized by the cushion-forming Juncaceae of the genus Oxychloe, Distichia and Patosia, as well as Cyperaceae of the genus Zameioscirpus. This particularity of Southern Hemisphere cushion peatlands is unique and exclusive to the high-Andean regions of South America. The floristic composition and site factors of 340 peatlands were studied between 1995-2013 to investigate changes in the vegetation of the high Andean peatlands from its southernmost distribution in Argentina (39 degrees S, province of Neuquen) to the limit with Bolivia (22 degrees S, province of Jujuy). Site factors were characterized based on water samples. Data for precipitation and temperature conditions was obtained from the WorldClim 2.0 dataset. Cushion-plant species and their accompanying flora clearly reflect the changing ecological conditions along the marked climatic gradient from south to north. A group of species is limited to the southern region of the study area (provinces of Neuquen and Mendoza), and another group is limited almost exclusively to the northern region (provinces of San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Salta and Jujuy). Some Oxychloe species are distributed only in the transition zone between the winter and predominantly summer rainfall zone, however, many accompanying species show wide ecological amplitudes. The quality in the supply of minerals does not seem to play a decisive role in the differentiation of vegetation, except for the concentration of salts. Climatic conditions seem to be more relevant to the presence of the species. Our research shows that the survival of the plants is closely linked to the rainfall regime and seasonal temperature fluctuations. Similarly, the survival of plants and the potential formation of flowers and mature seeds depends on the presence of pollinators and species that disperse seeds (e.g. birds and camelids). Mobility by dispersion is also necessary for plant survival in the high Andean regions, which have experienced repeated climatic changes over the past centuries and millennia. This brought about the permanent displacement of the zoning of vegetation, and with it, the displacement of zones favorable for cushion-plant growth. The phylogenetic relationships and the spatial distribution suggest that the cushion-forming Juncaceae, depending on the evolution of climate, geomorphological processes and local site conditions, progressed step by step from the south to the north. Their current distribution is therefore largely understood as a result of short-term and long-term climatic changes.

AB 1. Due to its novelty and scale, the EMBER project is a key study within the prescribed burning evidence base. However, it has several significant but overlooked methodological flaws.
   2. In this paper, we outline and discuss these flaws. In doing so, we aim to highlight the current paucity of evidence relating to prescribed burning impacts on ecosystem services within the British uplands.
   3. We show that the results of the EMBER project are currently unreliable because: it used a correlative space-for-time approach; treatments were located within geographically separate and environmentally distinct sites; environmental differences between sites and treatments were not accounted for during statistical analysis; and, peat surface temperature results are suggestive of measurement error.
   4. Policy Implications. Given the importance of the EMBER project, our findings suggest that (a) government agencies and policymakers need to re-examine the strengths and limitations of the prescribed burning evidence base; and, (b) future work needs to control for site-specific differences so that prescribed burning impacts on ecosystem services can be reliably identified.

AB A relationship was sought between species distribution and seasonal change in the redox property of peat in a floating mat in Mizorogaike Pond, central Japan. The mat surface experienced an annual submergence-emergence cycle due to its sinking-rising movement. Redox potential (Eh) of the surface peat showed little difference between communities in the mat in the submergence season (January-June) and early emergence season (July-August). However variation in Eh among communities was dear in the late emergence season (September-December). Among seven communities in the floating mat, the Menyanthes trifoliata-Rhynchospora fauriei, M. trifoliata-Eriocaulon sikokianum-E. hondoense f. pilosum, Sphagnum cuspidatum and M. trifoliata-Carex thunbergii communities had high Eh (400-600 mV) in the late emergence season, while the Menyanthes trifoliata and Phragmites australis-M. trifoliata communities had lower Eh (200-400 mV). The M. trifoliata-Isachne globosa community was intermediate (300-500 mV). The earlier the emergence of the peat surface began, the higher the Eh became in the late emergence season.

AB The transition from a command to a market economy resulted in widespread cropland abandonment across the former Soviet Union during the 1990s. Spatial patterns and determinants of abandonment are comparatively well understood for European Russia, but have not yet been assessed for the vast grain belt of Western Siberia, situated in the Eurasian forest steppe. This is unfortunate, as land-use change in Western Siberia is of global significance: Fertile black earth soils and vast mires store large amounts of organic carbon, and both undisturbed and traditional cultural landscapes harbor threatened biodiversity. We compared Landsat images from ca. 1990 (before the break-up of the Soviet Union) and ca. 2015 (current situation) with a supervised classification to estimate the extent and spatial distribution of abandoned cropland. We used logistic regression models to reveal important determinants of cropland abandonment. Ca. 135,000 ha classified as cropland around 1990 were classified as grassland around 2015. This suggests that ca. 20% of all cropland remain abandoned ca. 25 years after the end of the Soviet Union. Abandonment occurred mostly at poorly drained sites. The likelihood of cropland abandonment increased with decreasing soil quality, and increasing distance to medium-sized settlements, roads and railroads. We conclude that soil suitability, access to transport infrastructure and availability of workforce are key determinants of cropland abandonment in Western Siberia.

TI Palaeohydrologic conditions and geomorphic processes during the
   Postglacial in the Palatine Upper Rhine river floodplain
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID GERMANY
AB Stratigraphic, palynological, sedimentological, geophysical and Mollusc analyses of three peat cores from palaeomeanders in the floodplain of the Southern Palatine Upper Rhine river valley were used to reconstruct interrelations between palaeohydrologic, palaeoclimatic and geomorphodynamic changes throughout the genesis of the floodplain.
   Pollen analyses indicate that softwood floodplain forests probable were still absent to a large extent until the Early Subboreal. Anthropogenic impact oil the vegetation in the river floodplain was presumably only minor or absent. After the silting up of the oldest meander during the Late Atlanticum, peat formation started at the beginning of the Subboreal. Accumulation rates during this peatification phase were low. Subsequently, peat growth was interrupted during the Subboreal (since 3,450 cal. BP) for a period of almost 1,800 years. The results indicate that during a period of relatively stable river dynamics in the Mid-Holocene, dry and terrestrial site conditions prevailed in the Northern Upper Rhine river valley. The soils were mainly sandy and floods were rare.
   Since the Younger Iron Ages, the vegetation In the floodplain was influenced by humans. Flood dynamics had already increased considerably during the Late Subboreal, as indicated by a widespread influx of fine grained sediments into the Northern Upper Rhine valley. Due to these changes, a mosaic of different sites developed in the floodplain. This was a prerequisite for the establishment of a softwood floodplain forest, deduced from the new results of pollen analysis. Furthermore, the renewed peat formation within the oldest meander during the Migration Period and the incipient peat accumulation in the younger meanders in the Early Middle Ages suggest a rising groundwater table in the floodplain. The high peat accumulation rates are further evidence for good peat formation conditions in the Younger Holocene. Sediment layers within the upper peat layers of the palaeomeanders show a vast increase of flood activity of the Upper Rhine river since the High- and Late Middle Ages. From that time onwards huge areas of the Rhine river floodplain were flooded periodically.

AB Characteristics Of CO2-C exchange were studied in a temperate herbaceous wetland in 2006 and 2007, years with contrasting hydrological regimes. The wetland Mokre Louky (the "Wet Meadows" near Trebon), Czech Republic (49 degrees 01'30 '' N, 14 degrees 46'20 '' E) is a sedge-grass marsh dominated by Carex acuta L The site is situated in the inundation area of a large human-made lake (Rozmberk fishpond, 5 km(2)). The water table is near the soil surface and is fairly stable throughout the year (+/- 0.1 m), except for flood events, when it can reach up to 2 m above the soil surface. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was calculated from the CO2 fluxes measured by the eddy-covariance technique and was compared with the seasonal course of plant live aboveground biomass. The results show that: (1) the annual net uptake Of CO2-C Was 199 and 220 g C m(-1) yr(-1) in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The daily net CO2-C uptake reached 12-20 g C m(-2) day(-1) in sunny summer days. These values are among the highest values reported for wetlands of the northern hemisphere. (2) Although the observed wetland is adapted to floods, the summer flood substantially reduced its net CO2-C uptake. The daily courses of net CO2-C uptake point to reduced rates Of CO2-C fixation by the vegetation cover. (3) A recovery growth of plant biomass was associated with a second peak of NEP in September 2006. (4) Lack of knowledge on the dynamics of methane emissions presently limits deeper understanding of the effect of floods on carbon balance in wetlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growth of four white spruce (Picea glauca) clonal islands ranging in age from ca. 98 years to more than 400 years was investigated in the shrub zone of the forest-tundra east of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, The elongation of 20 similar-aged stems in each of the three youngest islands was monitored during 1988 and 1989. along with ground and air temperatures. Stems in the younger islands showed a more flexible response to both daily and annual variation in temperature, Younger islands showed faster recovery from frost events during elongation and longer periods of elongation in cooler years, Early spring warming that caused snowmelt to occur before the growing season appeared to result in moisture stress later in the period of elongation. In stems of spruce shrub, the branches are concentrated near ground level because growth is slow and adventitious buds develop on the stem after repeated loss of stem terminals through snow abrasion. In young trees, shading and increased moisture from trapped snow coincide with feather moss establishment and a deep active layer, resulting in higher ground temperatures and faster tree growth. It is during this early period of development that a tree may be best able to develop an erect stem. In later development, the lowest branches of trees become appressed, grow roots, and become second-order stems, and this process continues outward from the central stem. In older tree islands, peat accumulation and needle abrasion can lead to conditions less favourable for growth and maintenance of needles. Consequently, the canopy may thin, which reduces its ability to trap snow, When snow cover is reduced, lichen-heath establishes and permafrost intrudes into the mound. Subsequent growth of the secondary stems on the mound may be too slow to enable successful development of an erect stem. Thus. island development is largely dependent on changing ground temperatures, which become colder as peat accumulates and frost heaving elevates the mound. Warm spring and summer conditions appear to lead to unfavourable conditions for tree islands.

AB A late Pliocene incised valley fill to lacustrine succession, which contains an interbedded brown coal seam (< 20 m thick), is examined in terms of facies analysis, physical stratigraphy and sequence architecture. The succession (< 50 m thick) constitutes the first depositional event of the Castelnuovo Synthem, which is the oldest unconformity bounded stratigraphic unit of the nonmarine Upper Valdamo Basin, Northern Apennines (Italy). The integration of field surveys and borehole logs identified the following event sequence: first valley filling stages by coarse alluvial fan and channelised streams; the progressive setting of low gradient floodbasins with shallow floodplain lakes; subsequent major waterlogging and extensive peat mire development; and system drowning and establishment of permanent lacustrine conditions. The deposits are grouped in a set of nested valley fills and are arranged as high-frequency depositional sequences.
   The sequences are bounded by minor erosive truncations and have distinctive upward trends: lowstand system tract thinning; transgressive system tract thickening; highstand system tract thinning and eventual non-deposition; and the smoothing of along-sequence boundary sub-aerial incisions. Such features fit in with the notion of an idealised model where second-order (high-frequency) fluctuations, modulated by first-order (low-frequency) base-level rising, have short-lived standing + falling phases and prolonged transgressions, respectively. Furthermore, the general sequence architecture reveals how a mixed palustrinesiliciclastic system differs substantially from a purely siliciclastic one. In the transgressive phases, terrigenous starvation induces prevailing peat accumulation, generating abnormally thick transgressive system tracts that eventually come to occupy much of the same transgression-generated accommodation space. In the highstand phases, the development of thick highstand system tracts is then prevented by sediment upstream trapping due to retrogressive fluvial aggradations, probably coupled with low-accommodation settings inherited from the transgressive phases.

AB Due to the importance of the wide occurrence of thick coal seams for Chinese coal resources, the origins of these seams have received considerable attention. Using the Early Cretaceous No. 5 coal seam with a thickness of 16.8 m in Inner Mongolia as a case study, this paper presents a systematic investigation of the coal petrology, geochemistry, and palynology of 19 coal samples to explain the origin and evolution of peat accumulation. The results indicate that the No. 5 coal seam is generally characterized by low rank (lignite), dominant huminite (average = 82.3%), intermediate ash yield (average = 16.03%), and sulfur content (average = 1.12%). The proportion of spores generally increases from the bottom to the top of the coal seam, whereas the proportion of pollen decreases. The vegetation in the coal seam is dominated by gymnosperms at the bottom and by ferns at the top. The paleographic precursor peat was most likely accumulated in the lakeshore where herbaceous and bushy helophytes were dominant. The total sulfur content was positively related to the huminite content. The sulfur content was possibly derived from bacterial action with sulfur brought in via marine incursions. Three overall declining-increasing values of carbon isotopes within the No. 5 coal seam possibly indicated three general cooling trends during peat accumulation. The environment of peat accumulation included three cycles, including one drying-wetting-drying in the bottom part and two drying-upwards cycles in the upper part. These cycles of the peat-accumulation environment could likely be ascribed to climate change because of their good agreement with humidity signals from plant types at that stage.

AB The analysis of experimental materials obtained in various regions of Russia and Belarus suggests that the thawing depth of plowed peat soils depends on the sum of mean daily air temperatures after the snow melting. The effect of other factors, including the latitudinal position of particular places, the water-physical properties of soils, and their geomorphic position on slopes of different aspects, is concealed by the major role of the heat flux from the atmosphere. The suggested exponential equation to describe this dependence can be applied for prediction of the thawing depth of arable peat soils in the European part of Russia and in West Siberia.

AB Campbell Island lies 600 km southeast of the New Zealand mainland. Scrub, grassland, rushes and large-leaved forb vegetation grow on the deep peats that cover nearly the entire island. Campbell Island was extensively glaciated at the height of the Last Glaciation and mean annual temperatures were about 5 degrees C below present. Feat growth began c. 13 000 BP, and large-leaved forbs, rushes and other tundra plants grew under a cooler (-3 degrees C) climate than now. Grassland largely replaced the large-leaved forbs at around 9500 BP as the climate warmed. Scrub and dwarf forest of Dracophyllum was uncommon until around 7000 BP and reached its greatest altitudinal and areal extent between then and 3000 BP. Warmer (+0.5 degrees C), drier summer conditions during the mid- to late Holocene favoured this scrub expansion. In the late Holocene, Dracophyllum scrub was reduced in density and altitudinal range, probably by cooling temperatures and increased southwesterly winds. A warming of the island by 1 degrees C since the turn of the century may have encouraged Dracophyllum to spread into tussock and bog communities depleted by late nineteenth to early twentieth century fire and grazing.

AB Aim The long-term stability of coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and salt marshes depends upon the maintenance of soil elevations within the intertidal habitat as sea level changes. We examined the rates and processes of peat formation by mangroves of the Caribbean Region to better understand biological controls on habitat stability.
   Location Mangrove-dominated islands on the Caribbean coasts of Belize, Honduras and Panama were selected as study sites.
   Methods Biological processes controlling mangrove peat formation were manipulated (in Belize) by the addition of nutrients (nitrogen or phosphorus) to Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), and the effects on the dynamics of soil elevation were determined over a 3-year period using rod surface elevation tables (RSET) and marker horizons. Peat composition and geological accretion rates were determined at all sites using radiocarbon-dated cores.
   Results The addition of nutrients to mangroves caused significant changes in rates of mangrove root accumulation, which influenced both the rate and direction of change in elevation. Areas with low root input lost elevation and those with high rates gained elevation. These findings were consistent with peat analyses at multiple Caribbean sites showing that deposits (up to 10 m in depth) were composed primarily of mangrove root matter. Comparison of radiocarbon-dated cores at the study sites with a sea-level curve for the western Atlantic indicated a tight coupling between peat building in Caribbean mangroves and sea-level rise over the Holocene.
   Main conclusions Mangroves common to the Caribbean region have adjusted to changing sea level mainly through subsurface accumulation of refractory mangrove roots. Without root and other organic inputs, submergence of these tidal forests is inevitable due to peat decomposition, physical compaction and eustatic sea-level rise. These findings have relevance for predicting the effects of sea-level rise and biophysical processes on tropical mangrove ecosystems.

AB There is increased interest in how to balance military preparedness and environmental protection at Department of Defense (DoD) facilities. This research evaluated a peat moss-based technology to enhance the adsorption and biodegradation of explosive residues at military testing and training ranges. The evaluation was performed using 30-cm-long soil columns operated under unsaturated flow conditions. The treatment materials were placed at the soil surface, and soil contaminated with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) was spread over the surface. Simulated rainfall initiated dissolution and leaching of the explosive compounds, which was monitored at several depths within the columns. Peat moss plus soybean oil reduced the soluble concentrations of TNT, RDX and HMX detected at 70 cm depth by 100%, 60%, and 40%, respectively, compared to the no-treatment control column. Peat moss alone reduced TNT and HMX concentrations at 10 cm depth relative to the control, but exhibited higher soluble RDX concentrations by the end of the experiment. Concentrations of HMX and RDX were also reduced at 30 em depth by the peat moss plus soybean oil treatments relative to those observed in the control column. These preliminary results demonstrate proof-of-concept of a low cost technology for reducing the contamination of groundwater with explosives at military test and training ranges.

AB Long-term increases in DOC concentration in rivers draining areas of upland peat are a ubiquitous phenomenon in the UK. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these increases, but one compelling explanation is the observed long-term increase in temperature in UK uplands causing increases in peat decomposition rates, and increasing the depth of oxidation as evaporation increases depth to the water table. The study constructed an empirical model for water table depth and decomposition rate calibrated against observations from the Environmental Change Network monitoring site at Moor House in the North Pennines, UK. The study shows: (i) Depth of the water table has not changed significantly over a 30-year period, reflecting the fact that blanket peat is well buffered against climate change. (ii) Increases in temperature are responsible for a 12% increase in DOC production while an approximate 78% increase in DOC production has been observed. (iii) Overall DOC production is predicted to rise by 6% but observation suggests increases on the scale of 97%. (iv) The model inadequately represents changes in production and supply of DOC during periods of severe drought. The study shows that temperature change alone is insufficient to explain observed increases in DOC production. Alternative explanations for large increases in DOC production could include changes in land management, but an enzymic latch mechanism, i.e. derepression of anaerobic degradation, causing increased decomposition rates in response to severe drought is preferred.

AB Agricultural peat soils are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O). Emissions of N2O were measured from field plots of grass, barley, potatoes and fallow on a peat field in northern Finland during 2000-2002 and in southern Finland in 1999-2002. In the north the mean annual fluxes of N2O (with their standard errors) during 2 years were 4.0 (+/-1.2), 13 (+/-3.0) and 4.4 (+/-0.8) kg N ha(-1) from the plots of grass, barley and fallow, respectively. In the north there were no significant thaw periods in the middle of winter. As a result, the thawing in the spring did not induce especially large N2O emissions. Emissions of N2O were larger in the south than in the north. In the southern peat field the mean annual fluxes during 3 years were 7.3 (+/-1.2), 15 (+/-2.6), 10 (+/-1.9) and 25 (+/-6.9) kg N2O-N ha(-1) for grass, barley, potato and fallow plots, respectively. Here, the largest single episodes of emission occurred during the spring thaw each year, following winter thaw events. An emission factor of 10.4 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) for the N2O emission from the decomposition of the peat results from these data if the effect of fertilization according to the IPCC default emission factor is omitted. The direct effect of adding N as fertilizer on N2O emissions was of minor importance. On average, 52% of the annual N2O flux entered the atmosphere outside the cropping season (October-April) in the north and 55% in the south. The larger N2O fluxes from the peat soil in the south might be due to the more humified status of the peat, more rapid mineralization and weather with more cycles of freezing and thawing in the winter.

AB Potential rates of N mineralization and nitrification were measured in samples taken from three depths of the peat layer, Ag and Eg horizons in a peaty gley soil in Northumberland in September and May. The site, originally supporting moorland vegetation dominated by Molinia, had been planted with lodgepole pine, Sitka spruce and birch 25 years previously. Soil moisture content in the upper and middle peat layers beneath the trees was lower than that under Molinia and this effect was greater and extended to deeper layers beneath lodgepole pine. The upper peat layer was more acid beneath the trees (pH(CaCl2) = 3.0-3.1) than that under Molinia (pH(CaCl2) = 3.3, base saturation: 5%) an effect that was detected throughout the profile. Net mineralization of N decreased with increasing depth in the profile, but relative nitrification (NO(3)/(NH(4)(+) + NO(3)(-))), after an initial decrease, increased in the lower peat and Ag horizon as the inorganic mineral content and pH increased. Rates of net mineralization of N (NH(4)(+) + NO(3)(-)) under aerobic conditions were similar beneath all tree species. Nitrification was active beneath Molinia, but was almost absent in the upper peat (0-7 cm) beneath the trees. In the lower peat layers, nitrification was more active beneath pine than under Molinia, spruce or birch, coinciding with lower summer water table and lower soil moisture beneath the pine. The decline in nitrification beneath the trees in the upper peat was attributed to the increased acidity associated with enhanced interception of atmospheric deposition by tree canopies. Incubation under waterlogged conditions at 30 degreesC to assess potential N availability showed no depletion of available N beneath the trees. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The boreal forest is a region characterized by wide swings in temperature and light levels over the course of a year. This seasonal variability strongly effects the vegetation of this biome. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) Values were observed at daily timescales for key land cover types of the boreal forest, developing a more detailed description of seasonal changes in NDVI than could be produced from satellite data. NDVI Values were calculated from tower-mounted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and global solar sensors measuring both incoming and reflected radiation above the canopies at four Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) sites. Comparisons were made between the tower-based broadband hemispherical NDVI values and the narrowband nadir-viewed NDVI values from helicopter modular multiband radiometer (MMR). The comparisons indicate that the tower NDVI values are close to the MMR NDVIs in value for the BOREAS sites, but the range in tower NDVIs is not so great as in the MMR NDVIs. In 1996, BOREAS towers operated from before thaw to freeze-up, allowing a complete picture of growing season NDVI for fen, young jack pine, black spruce, and aspen sites. The tower-based NDVI time series display different patterns for each vegetation type, showing the effects of snow cover and vegetation green-up and senescence. Changes in solar zenith angles are shown to have little effect on the seasonal NDVI patterns.

AB Many research studies have evaluated potential organic and mineral container substrate components for use in commercial potting substrates. Most studies report results of plant growth over a single production season and only a few include physical properties of the substrates tested. Furthermore, substrates containing predominantly organic components decompose during crop production cycles producing changes in air and water ratios. In the commercial nursery industry, crops frequently remain in containers for longer periods than one growing season (18 to 24 months). Changes in air and water retention characteristics over extended periods can have significant effect on the health and vigor of crops held in containers for 1 year or more. Decomposition of organic components can create an overabundance of small particles that hold excessive amounts of water, thus creating limited air porosity. Mineral aggregates such as perlite, pumice, coarse sand, and calcined clays do not decompose, or breakdown slowly, when used in potting substrates. Blending aggregates with organic components can decrease changes in physical properties over time by dilution of organic components and preserving large pore spaces, thus helping to maintain structural integrity. Research is needed to evaluate changes in container substrates from initial physical properties to changes in air and water characteristics after a production cycle.

AB Seed size and germination time are related to factors affecting natural regeneration of forest stands. Sources of seed mass variation and the effect of seed mass on seedling performance were investigated in a Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii population. From eight maternal plants, seed mass variation was characterized for two crops at the within-individual level by mean, coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis values. Fifty seeds were planted in each of two substrate types, to monitor emergence, and survival and seedling performance during one growing season. Most variation in seed mass occurred within trees (c. 61%), rather than between them (c. 39%). Seed mass influenced emergence, depending on substrate type and mother plant. There were between-tree differences in the date of emergence, and a negative relationship was found between seed mass and date of emergence for the pine-seeds sown in peat substrate. The growth of seedlings was positively related to seed mass. It was argued that successful establishment of seedlings appears to be dependent on mother plant identity associated to seed traits, and that Pinus nigra stands could achieve regeneration by two different alternatives, depending on whether environmental variance overwhelms genetic variation.

ID SHELF
AB The results of mineralogical-geochemical studies of the oligotrophic pine-fruticulose-sphagnum segment of Vasyugan Swamp (West Siberia) in the winter of 2017 are presented. A mathematical model is developed for the depth distribution of chemical elements in water and acid extracts of peats, organo-mineral sediments, and inorganic soil. It is shown that two complex geochemical barriers related to the changes in filtration properties of soils and contributing to the formation and/or accumulation of Fe compounds and other chemical elements function in the peat deposit. The first (oxidizing, reduction, sulfide, and adsorption hydroxide) barrier is found approximately at a depth of 0.40-1.25 m; the second (alkaline carbonate and hydrolytic, adsorption hydroxide, clayey, and carbonate) barrier lies in the lower layer of the peat deposit (a depth of 2.25-2.50 m). The result obtained is important for understanding the production-destruction methane cycle.

AB The hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a very suitable process to transform wet biomass feedstocks into a peat-like material without drying the biomass input. Therefore, the energetic balance is more favorable than for alternative processes converting biomass as a whole. Further synergies can be achieved when the plant is employed as central hub for a regional biorefinery. Hence, a HTC pilot plant is operated with garden prunings and monitored during two years. It is shown that the elemental composition of HTC carbon is relatively constant. A carbon content of higher than 60% (based on dry, ash-free matter) is achieved. Fixed carbon content and volatile matter show low variation being the volatile content quite high with 61% on average. Dried in a post-process treatment which is less energy-demanding than drying of the raw biomass and pressed into pellets or briquettes the HTC carbon can be used as solid biofuel fulfilling the European standard (EN 14961-6).
   With a regional thermal valorization of the biofuel the ashes can be returned as phosphorous source to the crop land from which the biomass was harvested. Part of the process water, which involves a high amount of potassium, can be used for crop irrigation. In this way, valuable plant nutrients are recovered for soil remediation. Hence, closing the nutrient cycles a HTC plant can be considered as a sustainable local biorefinery producing a solid biofuel. Thereby, solar energy is exploited which was fixed before by photosynthesis together with the carbon dioxide which is liberated in the combustion of the solid biofuel. Optionally, the process water might serve as an alternative source of energy as it is demonstrated that its carbon content can be exploited for biogas production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

DE BOG; re-liquefaction; CCS
AB This paper presents the review on the boil-off gas re-liquefaction system of liquefied CO2 transport ship for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). It is assumed that liquefied CO2 is transported between South Korea and Middle East for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and enhanced gas recovery (EGR), which is similar to the oil and LNG transportation route. The concept of open re-liquefaction cycle which means that the boil-off CO2 is compressed, cooled, and expanded before being piped back into the tank is suggested. The effects of impurities on the re-liquefaction cycle is investigated under the condition of fixed cooling capacity in terms of cycle performance and reliability. Specifications of LCO2 transport ship about storage tank and re-liquefaction system is reviewed. In addition, economic feasibility is investigated. As for the case of the present study, negative effects of impurities on the cycle performance and reliability should be considered due to its considerable effects. Conservatively calculated internal rate of return (IRR) of the reliquefaction system shows 4.1%, therefore, it can be guessed that the BOG re-liquefaction system will have economic validity in the future CCS chain.

AB Pollen analysis of a 1 m 80 core, taken from Tamsaa swamp at 3000 m on the northern side of the Bale Mountains, southern Ethiopia, shows, from ca. 13,000-10,000 C-14 year BP, Apiaceae-dominated pioneer toeless vegetation on the deglaciated landscape. A rise in Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae around 10,000 year BP may indicate a change to a drier climate. A hiatus in peat accumulation occurred during the early to mid Holocene. This may be related to the destruction of organic matter during dry intervals of the early Holocene and during the mid-Holocene aridity. Late Holocene peat accumulation is thought to be related to the onset of a moist phase around 2500 year BP. During the same period, pollen from the present day forest limit taxa, namely Juniperus and Hagenia, which presently grow around the studied site, began to rise. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH

DT Article
AB Optimization of the performance of a closed-loop, milling depth control system for a peat milling machine was undertaken. The system was optimized using a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, set at a proportional gain of 50, and derivative and integral times of 0.5 and 0.89 s, respectively, giving a bandwidth of 66 rad s (- 1) with a response similar to a first-order system. The system was evaluated by comparison with the existing manual control method, and revealed large reductions in crop depth (yield) variation. The system allows the driver of the miller numerical control over peat crop depth (yield) in a way not previously feasible. The variance of depth produced by automatic control was at most a quarter (at 95% confidence) of that of manual control, on a depth-distance basis. Frequency domain comparison of the control methods, revealed a 71% reduction in the amplitudes of depth variation at frequencies below 45 rads(-1) for the automatic method. The significant advantages afforded by the system, give the peat production industry a tool, which if used in conjunction with application mapping technology, can lead to significant benefits in the quality control of peat production.

ID HISTORY; AGE
AB A series of radiocarbon (C-14) dates of peat and other materials, containing organic matter, were obtained from Belyi Island. We have identified a large group of dates associates with MIS 1, as well as a significant group of dates associated with the Kargin (MIS 3) period (40-31 ka cal BP). A large number of dates from the Late Glacial period and from the Early Holocene (MIS 1-ca. 14-9 ka cal BP) point to this time interval being associated with warm climate conditions (the Holocene thermal maximum). The climate cooled off significantly during the Middle and Late Holocene, and the intensity of peat accumulation declined. The dates from the MIS 2 period are missing, due to the conditions of this period being extremely unfavorable for the accumulation of peat, as well as of other materials suitable for C-14 dating.

AB Data are reported on the chemical variations in amino acids and carbohydrates and isotopic compositions of the individual carbohydrates which have been isolated from living matter, Sphagnum, and from the underlying peat. These results are supported by a C-13 NMR assessment of the same samples. Carbohydrates isolated from plants and animals have carbon isotopic compositions which are recognized to be associated with isotopic fractionations during the incorporation and metabolism of carbon. The isotopic label can be used to trace sources of carbohydrates in materials undergoing diagenesis. Production of non-indigenous carbohydrates, which may be associated with bacterial action, can be identified through more depleted isotopic compositions in the carbohydrates from a "soft" hydrolysis. Xylose, glucose and galactose, for example, isolated from the fresh plant, became more depleted C-13 during peat formation, possibly indicating a microbial source. Mannose, rhamnose and arabinose, isolated from the same peat samples, remained fairly constant in their isotopic compositions, reflective of the indigenous plant input. The cellulose portion of the samples also remained isotopically constant during diagenesis, whereas a more refractory isolate, the residue following exhaustive chemical degradation, became depleted in C-13 with depth in the peats, indicating a post-depositional formation.

   MOISTURE; DIOXIDE; FLOOR; DECOMPOSITION; PLANTATIONS
AB The amounts of carbon stored in soils and vegetation in Britain, and the potential of forestry to influence, whether soils act as sinks or sources, are discussed. Soils are estimated to contain c.22 X 10(9) t carbon, while the amount in vegetation including forests is only 115 X 10(6) t. Some 86 per cent of the soil carbon is present in pears and peaty-surfaced soils, mainly in north-west Britain. Soil carbon content is strongly related to climate and altitude. Conversion of lowland cultivated land to forest can result in carbon accumulation in soils, as it can following the planting of some uplands, but quantities appear to be small in relation to the amounts carbon released to the atmosphere through fossil fuel use. Forest felling may result in decreases in soil carbon store, due to soil disturbance and changes in microclimatic conditions, but several decades after reafforestation the carbon store may recover to near original levels. Shortening forest rotations may result in long-term declines in soil carbon store. The main concern is the potential for forestry to convert peats, which contain amounts of carbon equivalent to 100 years' fossil fuel use at 1988 levels and which are normally slow sinks for atmospheric carbon, into carbon sources returning it to the atmosphere. The possible impacts of forestry and global warming on rates of carbon loss from upland soils including peats are discussed.

AB From 1989 to 1993 the foliar uptake of radioactive strontium (Sr-85) and cesium (Cs-134) by selected leaves of grapevine plants and the subsequent redistribution within the plants was examined under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. The radionuclides were applied as chlorides. These plants were grown in large pots containing a mixture of local soil and peat. Plant and soil samples were analyzed throughout the growing season and also during the following vegetation period. Only traces of the applied radiostrontium were taken up by the leaves. This element was essentially not redistributed within the plants. In contrast, radiocesium was easily taken up through the leaf surface, transported to other plant parts and to some extent released from the roots into the soil. Cesium reaching the soil may interact with clay particles causing a very reduced availability for plants. Therefore the soil may act as a long-term sink for radiocesium. On the other hand, grape berries represent transient sinks. The cesium levels in the berries decreased again in a late phase of maturation, but the mechanisms causing this loss are not yet identified. During the second vegetation period, only a very minor proportion of the radiocesium taken up previously by the plants was present in the above ground parts.

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes 1997-2010 were studied by combining remotely sensed normalised difference water index (NDWI) with in situ CH4 fluxes from Rylekaerene, a high-Arctic wet tundra ecosystem in the Zackenberg valley, north-eastern Greenland. In situ CH4 fluxes were measured using the closed-chamber technique. Regression models between in situ CH4 fluxes and environmental variables [soil temperature (T-soil), water table depth (WtD) and active layer (AL) thickness] were established for different temporal and spatial scales. The relationship between in situ WtD and remotely sensed NDWI was also studied. The regression models were combined and evaluated against in situ CH4 fluxes. The models including NDWI as the input data performed on average slightly better [root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.56] than the models without NDWI (RMSE = 1.67), and they were better in reproducing CH4 flux variability. The CH4 flux model that performed the best included exponential relationships against temporal variation in T-soil and AL, an exponential relationship against spatial variation in WtD and a linear relationship between WtD and remotely sensed NDWI (RMSE = 1.50). There were no trends in modelled CH4 flux budgets between 1997 and 2010. Hence, during this period there were no trends in the soil temperature at 10 cm depth and NDWI.

AB More than eighty years of mining at the Novo-Ursk Au-bearing sulfide field (Kemerovo region, Russia) have produced a mixed natural-industrial system "wastes-gold-bearing acid mine drainage (AMD) waters-peat". The behavior of Au, Ag and related elements in the system "wastes-AMD" is described in Part 1 of our study (Myagkaya et al. 2016) where we discuss interaction between the gold-bearing mine drainage waters and peat. This interaction leads to rapid accumulation of Ca, Fe, Mn, Ba, Cu, Zn, Se, Au, Ag, Hg, Pb to concentrations exceeding those in cyanidation wastes (especially, Cu, Zn, Se, Hg, and Pb). The contents of Au (about 5 ppm on average, locally as high as 155 ppm) and Ag (average about 11.2 ppm, locally up to 560 ppm) in peat are above the lowest economic values. These results provide clues to technologies for both generation of secondary gold (silver) deposits at existing or planned tailings and immobilization of toxic elements.
   Gold is accumulated in peat by a series of processes (reduction of ion gold to elemental form, sorption by complexation, biochemical reactions, etc.). This secondary gold is mostly chemically bound and invisible and a minor part is nanoparticulate (from tens of nm to 1.5-4 mu m particles; with 7.5-53 parts per thousand Cu); it coexists with barite, secondary pyrite, tiemannite, Hg and Zn sulfides. Silver becomes redeposited in peat as silver-bearing sulfides and selenides. The presence of fossil bacterial fragments points to microbially mediated physicochemical processes leading to sulfide and gold mineralization by sulfate reduction and biosorption. Formation of abundant gold and mercury minerals may be due primarily to microbial activity.
   Peat in the area of the Ursk tailings is actually a prototype of coalbeds. Therefore, the mineralogical and geochemical patterns of gold and silver reprecipitation on organic matter, and the respective Au and Ag enrichment, provide insights into the early history of gold mineralization in coal.

AB Based on evidence from forest ecosystems that litter decomposition is highest in its home habitat, the so-called home field advantage (HFA), we tested whether HFA also occurs in production grasslands, to which solid cattle manure (SCM) was applied. Two dairy farms were selected which differed in type of home-produced SCM (stacked or composted) and soil type (sand or peat). Disappearance patterns of manure dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) were monitored from litterbags (4 mm mesh size) during the grass growing season. At the same time, apparent herbage N recovery (ANR) of SCM, applied at two rates (200 and 400 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), was measured. On average, manure DM and N disappearances on the home farms were 20 and 14% greater, respectively, than on away farms. Differences in ANR were also very pronounced (on average 14 and 53% higher at home than away for the two respective application rates). The two SCM types were also studied on two neighbouring dairy farms (one on sand and one on peat soil) where no SCM had been applied for many years. Here, manure DM and N disappearances from the litterbags were much lower (P < 0.01). This experiment provides strong evidence for a home field advantage in production grasslands differing in fertilization history, showing that site-specific manure management affects the soil-plant interactions regulating plant N-availability. These findings have to be taken into account when changing fertilization regimes in production grasslands. This is the first report to quantify a HFA from an agricultural ecosystem. HFA values we report here have not been established in any ecosystem thus far. (C) Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Young children with their hand-to-mouth activity may be exposed to contaminated soils. However few studies assessing exposure of organic compounds sequestrated in soil were realized. The present study explores the impact of different organic matters on retention of NDL-PCBs during digestive processes using commercial humic substances in a close digestive model of children: the piglet. Six artificial soils were used. One standard soil, devoid of organic matter, and five amended versions of this standard soil with either fulvic acid, humic acid, Sphagnum peat, activated carbon or a mix of Sphagnum peat and activated carbon (95:5) (SPAC) were prepared. In order to compare the different treatments, we use spiked oil and negative control animals. Forty male piglets were randomly distributed in 7 contaminated and one control groups (n = 5 for each group). During 10 days, the piglets were fed artificial soil or a corn oil spiked with 19 200 ng of Aroclor 1254 per g of dry matter (6 000 ng.g(-1) of NDL-PCBs) to achieve an exposure dose of 1 200 ng NDL-PCBs.Kg(-1) of body weight per day. NDL-PCBs in adipose tissue were analyzed by GC-MS. Fulvic acid reduced slightly the bioavailability of NDL-PCBs compared to oil. Humic acid and Sphagnum peat reduced it significantly higher whereas activated carbon reduced the most. Piglets exposed to soil containing both activated carbon and Shagnum peat exhibited a lower reduction than soil with only activated carbon. Therefore, treatment groups are ordered by decreasing value of relative bioavailability as following: oil >= fulvic acid > Sphagnum peat >= Sphagnum peat and activated carbon >= Humic acid >> activated carbon. This suggests competition between Sphagnum peat and activated carbon. The present study highlights that quality of organic matter does have a significant effect on bioavailability of sequestrated organic compounds.

TI Changes in the Elemental Composition of Lignin during Humification
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Lignin was extracted with aqueous dioxane in the genetic series of humification: dead nonhumified plants -> plant residues at the initial stage of humification (during the first 1-3 annual cycles) -> weakly decomposed peat -> highly decomposed peat. In the course of the humification and peat formation, the lignin was subjected to profound redox transformation; therefore, the elemental composition of the dioxane lignin in the humified peat-forming plants differed from that in the original plants by the higher contents of hydrogen and nitrogen and the lower contents of oxygen and carbon. As a result of the redox reactions, the lignin was partly oxidized and converted to humic substances during the humification of the dead plants. Therefore, it could not be extracted with aqueous dioxane. The reduced part of the lignin remained in the humified materials. The proportion of aromatic fragments in the molecules of the remaining lignin was smaller and that of aliphatic fragments larger than in the lignin of the original plants.

AB A large reservoir of organic carbon is stored in the permafrost region. Therefore, understanding the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from rivers in the permafrost zone is important in the context of climate change. This study investigated the dynamics of DOC export from the wetlands of the Kandu River catchment located in a cold temperate region in northeast China during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012. Our findings indicated that subsurface flow was the primary runoff pathway that transports DOC from wetland soil to stream discharge. The organic-mineral soil structure resulted in substantial differences in water sources, as well as in DOC resources, between the flood and base flow volume during the growing seasons. The active layer depth is key, as it affects runoff generation and the DOC concentration and chemical characteristics of stream discharge. The DOC flux from our study area was estimated to be up to 1039.66 t during the growing season, which represents more than one third of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in wetlands. Given the expected increase in air temperature and precipitation, our results indicate that there will be an increase in the total DOC flux for the study region in the future as a result of increased DOC concentration.

AB At a former Danish polluted landfill, a field experiment using biofilters as an ex-situ remediation strategy for leachate water was carried out. The leachate water was polluted with phenoxy acids, mecoprop, dichlorprop, and their impurities originated from previous years of disposal of production wastes. Three individual biofilters were set up and each was filled with different a support material, e.g., sand, stonewool, and peat amended sand. The sand biofilter was spiked with ammonium acetate in pulses lasting a week to stimulate biomass growth and thereby enhance the removal of the phenoxy acids. The effects on removal and enantioselectivity were studied during a 69-day sampling campaign. Results showed that stimulation of the microbial community with ammonium acetate provided a boost, hence removal in the sand biofilter increased after the dosing whereas the stonewool and peat biofilters showed generally low removal. The highest removal was observed after stimulation in the sand biofilter for both herbicides. After a starting period, the removal was compound-specific but ranged from 60-100%. The final concentrations exceeded the drinking water limits slightly (0.25 mu g L-1) (mecoprop and 2-(2/4-chlorophenoxy)propanoic acid), while it was considerably below the limit for all other compounds (2-(2-methylphenoxy)propanoic acid and dichlorprop). Enantioselective fractions were already 0.41, and 0.75 for mecoprop and dichlorprop, respectively, in the inlet, probably due to in-situ degradation in the landfill-Mecoprop showed some enrichment of the (R)-enantiomer in the sand biofilter whereas no real trends were seen in the stonewool and peat biofilter. Only minor alterations in enantiomeric fractions were observed for dichlorprop in all three biofilters. This experiment shows that it is feasible to remove micropollutants from landfill leachates and it is possible to stimulate biomass and thereby initiate and obtain increased removal faster.

TI SEASONAL GROWTH OF SCOTS PINE UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF WATER-LOGGED SOILS

SO LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL

ID RESPIRATION
AB The seasonal rhythm of height growth of young shoots of Scots pine growing in a 33-year-old shrubby-sphagnum pine forest of the northern taiga natural-climatic zone has been studied in a complex with the main physiological processes. The possibility of regulating their intensity by additional introduction of nitrogen fertilizer has been determined. It has been found that on hydromorphic excessively wet soils of the North, seasonal height growth of pine occurs with a maximum rate in late June and early July, when air temperature rises and the root system is released from excessive moisture. Unlike lichen pine forests, in which pine roots are not affected by flooding, on hydromorphic peat soils pine grows much slower and during the growing season has less intensive physiological processes. The low rate of shoot growth and physiological processes in pine in sphagnum forest site conditions is explained by dysfunction of its root system as a result of soil anoxia caused by flooding, as well as by insufficient supply of growing shoots with macronutrients from the crown as a result of violation of their normal outflow and movement in the tree. Nitrogen fertilizers positively affect growth and physiological processes in pine trees in sphagnum forest types. However, their effect in these forest site conditions is much weaker than in the dry lichen forests of the Far North. On water-logged peat soils under the influence of nitrogen fertilizer seasonal height growth of pine trees increases by 20 %, the duration of seasonal shoot growth increases by 8-10 days, the intensity of photosynthesis increases significantly, and, as a result of reduced water consumption for transpiration, the tree water regime normalizes and the transpiration productivity increases. These positive nitrogen-induced changes ultimately improve the viability and productivity of sphagnum pine forests.

AB The hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf waxes (delta D-wax) primarily reflects that of plant source water. Therefore, sedimentary delta D(wa)x records are increasingly used to reconstruct the delta D of past precipitation (delta D-p) and to investigate paleohydrologic changes. Such reconstructions rely on estimates of apparent fractionation (epsilon(app)) between delta D-p and the resulting delta D-wax. However, epsilon(app) values are modified by numerous environmental and biological factors during leaf wax production. As a result, epsilon(app) can vary widely among plant species and growth forms. This complicates estimation of accurate epsilon(app) values and presents a central challenge to quantitative leaf wax paleohydrology. During the 2014 growing season, we examined epsilon(app) in the five deciduous angiosperm tree species (Prunus serotina, Acer saccharinum, Quercus rubra, Quercus alba, and Ulmus americana) that dominate the temperate forest at Brown's Lake Bog, Ohio, USA. We sampled individuals of each species at weekly to monthly intervals from March to October and report delta D values of n-C-29 alkanes (delta Dn-C29 (alkane)) and n-C-28 alkanoic acids (delta Dn-C28 (acid)), as well as xylem (delta D-xw) and leaf water (delta D-lw). n-Alkane synthesis was most intense 2-3 weeks after leaf emergence and ceased thereafter, whereas n-alkanoic acid synthesis continued throughout the entire growing season. During bud swell and leaf emergence, delta D-lw was a primary control on delta Dn-C29 (alkane) and delta Dn-C28 (acid) values, which stabilized once leaves became fully expanded. Metabolic shifts between young and mature leaves may be an important secondary driver of delta D-wax changes during leaf development. In mature autumn leaves of all species, the mean epsilon(app) for n-C29 alkane (-107%) was offset by approximately-19% from the mean epsilon(app) for n-C28 alkanoic acid (-88%). These results indicate that in temperate settings n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids from deciduous trees are distinct with respect to their abundance, timing of synthesis, and epsilon(app) values.

AB We present a network of sites across Fennoscandia for optical sampling of vegetation properties relevant for phenology monitoring and satellite data calibration. The network currently consists of five sites, distributed along an N-S gradient through Sweden and Finland. Two sites are located in coniferous forests, one in a deciduous forest, and two on peatland. The instrumentation consists of dual-beam sensors measuring incoming and reflected red, green, NIR, and PAR fluxes at 10-min intervals, year-round. The sensors are mounted on separate masts or in flux towers in order to capture radiation reflected from within the flux footprint of current eddy covariance measurements. Our computations and model simulations demonstrate the validity of using off-nadir sampling, and we show the results from the first year of measurement. NDVI is computed and compared to that of the MODIS instrument on-board Aqua and Terra satellite platforms. PAR fluxes are partitioned into reflected and absorbed components for the ground and canopy. The measurements demonstrate that the instrumentation provides detailed information about the vegetation phenology and variations in reflectance due to snow cover variations and vegetation development. Valuable information about PAR absorption of ground and canopy is obtained that may be linked to vegetation productivity.

AB Climate-warming-induced permafrost thaw exposes large amounts of carbon and nitrogen in soil at considerable depths, below the seasonally thawing active layer. The extent to which plant roots can reach and interact with these hitherto detached, deep carbon and nitrogen stores remains unknown. We aimed to quantify how permafrost thaw affects root dynamics across soil depths and plant functional types compared with above-ground abundance, and potential consequences for plant-soil interactions. A decade of experimental permafrost thaw strongly increased total root length and growth in the active layer, and deep roots invaded the newly thawed permafrost underneath. Root litter input to soil across all depths was 10 times greater with permafrost thaw. Root growth timing was unaffected by experimental permafrost thaw but peaked later in deeper soil, reflecting the seasonally receding thaw front. Deep-rooting species could sequester N-15 added at the base of the ambient active layer in October, which was after root growth had ceased. Deep soil organic matter that has long been locked up in permafrost is thus no longer detached from plant processes upon thaw. Whether via nutrient uptake, carbon storage, or rhizosphere priming, plant root interactions with thawing permafrost soils may feed back on our climate both positively and negatively.

TI Organic amendments potentially stabilize metals in smelter contaminated

DE Soil remediation; Heavy metals; Carbon stock regulation
AB The long-term emission impacts of the nickel processing industry in the Kola Peninsula, the largest source of sulfur dioxide and heavy metals emissions in Northern Europe, have created vast technogenic barrens near the mineral industry complexes. The pace of rehabilitation using the improved remediation technologies to enhance sustainable environmental management and regional economic development is of crucial social and economic importance. In a 120-day incubation experiment, we evaluated the prospects for the restoration of two soils at different degradation stages via carbon pool regulation comparing to mineral ameliorants - NPK fertilizer, and liming agent. Organic additives used included a humic preparation based on an alkaline brown coal extract, wood-derived biochar, and peat-derived gel, supplied by mycorrhizae fungi. The results demonstrate that the selected organic amendments are suitable for restoration of acidic metal contaminated soils. Specifically, the treatments provided a measurable increase in soil carbon content, a marked decrease in acidity, a decrease in extractable metal contents, together with an enhanced nutrient uptake and vegetative growth. A stabilization effect increased from biochar to peat-gel, liming agent and humic preparation, with an accompanying increase in soil pH. Although biochar showed a reduced ability to metal stabilization, the associated treatments were the most productive. The most effective amendments in multi-metallic contaminated soils need to be able to stabilize bioavailability of metals, adjust pH to the optimum for plant growth, and regulate nutrient consumption.

AB Northern conditions are characterised by long days with much light and low temperatures during the growing season. It has been claimed that herbs and berries grown in the north are stronger tasting compared to those of southern origin. The compounds imparting aroma and color to berries and herbs are secondary metabolites which in plants mostly act as chemical means of defense. Recently, the production of secondary metabolites using plant cells has been the subject of expanding research. Light intensity, photoperiod and temperature have been reported to influence the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites. Native wild aromatic and medicinal plant species of different families are being studied to meet the needs of raw material for the expanding industry of e.g., health-promoting food products known as nutraceutics. There are already a large number of known secondary compounds produced by plants, but the recent advances in modern extraction and analysis should enable many more as yet unknown compounds to be found, characterised and utilised.
   Rose root (Rhodiola rosea) is a perennial herbaceous plant which inhabits mountain regions throughout Europe, Asia and east coastal regions of North America. The extract made from the rhizomes acts as a stimulant like the Ginseng root. Roseroot has been categorized as an adaptogen and is reported to have many pharmacological properties. The biologically active components of the extract are salitroside tyrosol and cinnamic acid glycosides (rosavin, rosarin, rosin).
   Round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia L.) has circumboreal distribution. It inhabits nutrient-poor, moist and sunny areas such as peat bogs and wetlands. Sundew leaves are collected from the wild-type for various medicinal preparations and can be utilized in treating e.g., as an important "cough-medicine" for different respiratory diseases. The antimicrobial activity of extracts of aerial parts against various bacteria has been investigated. Drosera produces various secondary metabolites. The most abundant, among these compounds, are the naphthoquinones. Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is a characteristic field layer species in boreal forests. Bilberry and other northern Vaccinium species, berries and leaves, contain high amounts of phenolic compounds. Bilberries are known for its exceptionally high amounts of anthocyanins with powerful antioxidant capacity. They have been shown to possess beneficial health effects, like having a protective role in cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Many flavonoids also seem to have antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiallergenic properties. The effect of ingested cranberry (V. oxycoccus) juice has been shown to prevent urinary tract infections in women.

SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
LA English

ID SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA; CARBONATE
AB The sedimentary infill of the Acigol maar lake, one of the volcanic centres in the Cappadocia district of Anatolia, contains unusual, high-calorific sub-Recent peat deposits, of which the origin is' attributed to geothermal processes. The sedimentary facies record is analyzed to reconstruct the lake's depositional history and to disentangle the combined signal of climatic and geothermal factors. The facies succession comprises: a lake-fringe elastic apron shed from the maar walls; early-stage, coarse-grained tuffaceous deposits of the lake proper, intercalated with brecciated mudstones and limestones; and final-stage, fine-grained tuffaceous deposits of the lake proper, intercalated with peats and plant-bearing clastics and with some terminal travertines. The closed lake was highly dependent on climate, particularly precipitation, and the depositional conditions were further controlled by a connective hydrothermal system which itself was driven by the input of meteoric water. The associated heat flow played an important role by creating a microclimatic niche, where even the impoverished late-Quaternary (cold regional climate) vegetation could flourish and form substantial peats. The varying hydrological budget of the lake was the main ''switching'' mechanism for the peat-forming conditions, with two water-depth thresholds involved. If the lake level rose too high, the low vegetation was drowned and hemipelagic elastic sedimentation prevailed. If the lake level fell too low, the vegetation was killed and formation of travertine took place. The heat flow through the pore water and elastic sediments was crucial to the high maturation of the peat deposits.

AB A 5.4 m peat core from the Sandy Run Creek (SRC) valley in the upper Coastal Plain of Georgia shows that before 30 ka the valley had an aggradational sandy floor with shallow swales and low ridges of 1-2 m amplitude suggesting a braided stream pattern and a low water table. The climate from 30-25 ka was cool and dry and the vegetation open grassland with stands of pine and spruce that produced few fires. At ca. 16 ka a warmer, wetter climate caused SRC to meander and incise the valley fill removing some previously deposited sediment at the site of our peat core so that sediments of 13 ka rest directly on sediments deposited at 25 ka. After ca. 13 ka higher groundwater levels initiated vertical accretion of floodplains allowing peat accumulation in shallow depressions across the valley. Pollen from the Younger Dryas period (ca. 13-11 ka) indicates a cool, moist environment of open oak woodland, mesic trees, riparian populations of alder, and reduced levels of pine. By the early to mid Holocene, tupelo and oak dominated over pine indicating wetter conditions, while sand stringers in peat record periodic heavy rains, an elevated water table, and intervals of substantial runoff. Cooling after ca. 4.5 ka brought drier and more variable conditions. Fires increased and southern pine replaced tupelo and oak. The absence of sand stringers in peat younger than 4.5 ka indicates fewer intense rainfall events. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peat is an abundant resource in Ireland and has the capacity to be used in low-cost, low-maintenance wastewater treatment systems for single houses. In this study four fibrous peat columns, of varying depths were constructed and tested in the laboratory for their capacity to remove contaminants from domestic-strength synthetic wastewater. The four filters had peat depths of 0.3 m, 0.6 m, 0.9 m and 1.2 m. During the 360 day study the filters were intermittently loaded with domestic strength synthetic wastewater at a hydraulic loading rate of 180 l/m(2)center dot d. Hydrographs and residence times for each filter were examined as was their ability to remove impurities from the wastewater. Removal of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)) and total chemical oxygen demand (COD(t)) were >= 96% and 84%, respectively, in all filters with almost complete nitrification (>= 99%) being recorded for each filter. The removal of total suspended solids (TSS) was excellent at >= 94% and no clogging was recorded on any filter during the study. For the 0.6 m, 0.9 m and 1.2 m deep filters, total viable counts (TVC) were less than EU surface water directive limits for Class A2 potable water sources. The systems were cheap to construct and very easy to maintain.

AB Holocene sediment cores from contemporary terrestrialised kettle holes on two islands in the Ostholstein lakeland area, Northern Germany, were investigated by palaeoenvironmental methods. Records from such isolated locations, such as these island mires, are an important source of information on small-scale vegetation changes. Pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and macrofossils were used to reveal anthropogenic impact as well as lake level fluctuations. Changes in the peat decomposition and the ratio of organic to minerogenic content in the sediment facilitated correlation with past ground water table levels and accordingly with former lake levels. The palynological surveys indicate that human impact on the islands expanded in prehistoric times during phases of low lake levels or periods of stable hydrological conditions. The first distinct low level is recorded between ca. 8210 and 7740 cal. yr b.p. Another major low level period was detected for the time span from approximately 5290 to 4600 cal. yr b.p. After a subsequent period with a wetter climate, indicated by rising and fluctuating lake levels culminating at ca. 2420 to 2180 cal. yr b.p., a third lowering occurred until about 660 cal. yr b.p. This period was interrupted by minor fluctuations in lake levels from ca. 1770 to 1630 cal. yr b.p. and from ca. 1370 to 1010 cal. yr b.p.

AB The reduction of human use in many grassland systems across Europe has led to bush encroachment and a loss of biodiversity. Low intensity grazing systems by livestock has often been used as a cost-effective management tool to counteract this process. However, not all semi-natural grasslands are suitable for this due to large distance from human settlements or adverse environmental conditions. In this study we address the question whether natural wild large ungulates can be a useful management tool as well. In nutrient-limited systems, large herbivores can affect vegetation dynamics by redistribution of nutrients next to their direct effects on the vegetation. They can preferentially forage plant species and deposit their pellets at other locations leading to nutrient redistribution. We studied whether moose (Alces alces) in the Biebrza National Park (Poland), plays a role in nitrogen dynamics. Microscopic analyses of faeces showed that 57% of the diet consisted of Salix cinerea, which was preferentially foraged upon indicated by a positive Jacobs' selectivity index. Pellet density was significantly higher in patches of S. cinerea compared to the surrounding vegetation. Based on the chemical composition of moose pellets and the pellet density, we calculated that moose-derived N (faeces and urine) leads to a relevant N-input in willow patches compared to other sources of N in the system. We show that moose do not redistribute nitrogen between different vegetation types but instead speed up the local recycling of nitrogen in patches dominated by willows during the growing season. As a consequence, nutrients become quicker available here than in other parts of the system. We hypothesize that enhanced N-availability in willow patches may off-set the growth reduction caused by moose browsing on willows, which fits to the observed continuous expansion of willows in the study area despite high density of moose. This suggests that moose likely stimulate the growth of willow rather than the often supposed suppression of this woody species. In these systems, more labour-intensive management (f.e. mowing) is required to counteract bush encroachment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Jurassic Walloon Coal Measures of the Surat Basin were previously estimated to be of Middle Jurassic age, ranging from Aalenian to Callovian, based on an uncalibrated eastern Australian biostratigraphic framework. New U-Pb dates of 162.55 +/- 0.05 Ma and 158.86 +/- 0.04 Ma obtained from zircons in ash-fall volcanic tuffs now place the Walloon Coal Measures of the Surat Basin in the Upper Jurassic Oxfordian. The new dates have several implications for the interpretation of the Jurassic strata in the Surat Basin. First-order subsidence rates of 61 m/Myr for the Walloon Coal Measures are more akin to those of foreland basins than the previously assumed intracratonic setting. The dates also imply deposition of the Walloon coals in substantially higher latitudes than previously assumed and that they accumulated as peats in mires that experienced more than three months' continual darkness each winter. Zircon dating of tuffs and associated geochemistry should assist with the correlation of the laterally impersistent coals, fluvial sandstone and mudstone of the Walloon Coal Measures, which are currently difficult to correlate over distances of more than a few kilometres. Dating of the palynostratigraphic zones APJ4.2 to APJ5 (Aequitriradites norrisii Association Zone to Murospora florida Association Zone) will also need to be recalibrated.

AB Mekong River Delta sediment bears arsenic that has been released to groundwater under anaerobic conditions over the past several thousand years. The oxidation state, speciation, and distribution of arsenic and the associated iron bearing phases are crucial determinants of As reactivity in sediments. Peat from buried mangrove swamps in particular may be an important host, source, or sink of arsenic in the Mekong Delta. The total concentration, speciation, and reactivity of arsenic and iron were examined in sediments in a Mekong Delta wetland by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and selective chemical extractions. Total solid-phase arsenic concentrations in a peat layer at a depth of 6 m below ground increased 10-fold relative to the overlying sediment. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy revealed that arsenic in the peat was predominantly in the form of arsenian pyrite. Arsenic speciation in the peat was examined further at the micron-scale using mu XRF and mu X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy coupled with principal component analysis. The multiple energy mu XRF mapping and mu XANES routine was repeated for both iron and sulfur phase analyses. Our mu XRF/mu XANES analyses confirm arsenic association with pyrite a less reactive host phase than iron (hydr) oxides under anaerobic conditions. The arsenian pyrite likely formed upon deposition/formation of the peat in a past estuarine environment (similar to 5.5 ka BP), a process that is not expected under current geochemical conditions. Presently, arsenian pyrite is neither a detectable source nor a sink for aqueous arsenic in our sediment profile, and under present geochemical conditions represents a stable host of As under the reducing aquifer conditions of the Mekong Delta. Furthermore, organic carbon within the peat is unable to fuel Fe(III) reduction, as noted by the persistence of goethite which can be reduced microbially with the addition of glucose.

AB The potential of entomogenous fungi to control black vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus (Fabricius)) larvae has been demonstrated on a range of protected crops species, but very little attention has been paid to weevil control on outdoor crops, such as strawberry. Curative applications of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin conidia to strawberry plants potted in field soil (5 X 10(8) conidia/pot) reduced the population of O. sulcatus larvae by up to 94%, whereas similar treatments reduced larval numbers in peat compost by a maximum of 53%. Significant differences in relative performance were observed among the four M. anisopliae strains (37-80, 101-82, 189-83, and 275-86) in the two media. Strain 189-83 was the most virulent isolate in both media, whereas strain 101-82 reduced the O. sulcatus population in field soil by only 15% and had no effect in peat compost. Larval establishment in the pots treated with 0.05% Triton X-100 (control treatment) was greater in peat compost than in field soil with nearly twice as many larvae in the former medium. The larval population was evenly distributed in most of the pots with the exception of the pots containing peat compost treated with strain 189-83 which showed significant heterogeneity. Spore density declined with increasing depth in pots containing peat compost. The situation was reversed in the pots of field soil and the highest spore concentrations were found at the base of the pots. More conidia were recovered from the pots containing peat compost than from the pots of field soil. There were also significant differences between strains in the number of colony forming units per sample. In both media, mean counts for strains 37-80 and 275-86 were significantly greater than those for strain 101-82; strain 189-83, however, had a low count in peat relative to 37-80 and 275-86, but had a higher count in field Soil.

AB The Karapinar-Ayranci deposit is the most significant one among the recently explored coal deposits in Turkey. The aim of the present study was to determine maceral, mineralogical, and elemental compositions of coal samples picked up from one borehole (DK-7) drilled at the northern part of the deposit. The coal samples display moderate to high ash yield (average 38.7%, on dry basis), high volatile matter yield (average 33.9%, on dry basis), high total sulfur (average 6.7%, on dry basis) and low hydrogen contents (average 4.8%, dry basis). Huminite is dominant, and liptinite and inertinite appear at low concentrations. The bulk coal samples contain mainly quartz, clay minerals (mainly illite and chlorite), muscovite, feldspars, carbonates (calcite and aragonite), and rarely pyrite and gypsum/bassanite. The maceral and mineralogical compositions point to mesotrophic and rheotrophic conditions during peat accumulation; nevertheless, the inorganic intercalations show that peat formation was ceased several times. The petrographical and mineralogical compositions of coal seams in northern and eastern parts of the deposit could imply vegetation and water chemistry differences. The abundance of fossil shell-bearing layers in the studied samples could imply a slightly higher water table than this in the eastern part. In addition, higher telohuminite content might be related to a higher contribution of tree/bush peat-forming vegetation in the northern part; however, the lack of xylite-rich lithotype and the abundance of fluorinite-type resinite imply the predominance of shrubs on the palaeomire's surface. Overall, the precursor peat in the northern part of the deposit was accumulated under pure telmatic to limnotelmatic conditions, vegetation heterogeneity and ditches transporting inorganic material from the margins were developed on the surface of the Karapmar-Ayranci palcomire.

DE FLOATING MAT; MICROTOPOGRAPHY; MIZOROGAIKE POND; TERRESTRIALIZATION;
   WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATION
AB The relationship between vegetation and seasonal changes in water level was examined in a system of terrestrializing floating peat mat and pond in a warm temperate zone. The duration of flooding, or drawdown period, is related to vegetation in the mat. The first process of terrestrialization would be the attenuation of floating-sinking movement of the mat and the consequent stabilization of water level. Water level at the time when the movement of the mat was attenuated determined the subsequent vegetation change at the site. Two series of succession according to terrestrialization were recognized, and started from initial conditions of low and high water levels respectively. Habitats in low initial water levels experienced short flooding and long drawdown periods. Species changes in the successional series were: Menyanthes trifoliata-Rhynchospora fauriei-Eriocaulon sikokianum-Sphagnum cuspidatum. Submerged peat was experimentally emerged, and the crowded community of Rhynchospora fauriei and Eriocaulon sikokianum established within one or two years. Appearance of these species was controlled by the water level of the habitats in winter. Another series of species changes in terrestrialization process was: Menyanthes trifoliata-Phragmites australis-Carex thunbergii or Isachne globosa. Habitats of these types of vegetation were in the area with relatively high initial water level (long flooding and short drawdown) when the floating-sinking movement of the mat attenuated. After the temporal paludification, the water level was lowered by the accumulation of peat in the process of terrestrialization.

AB The changes in chemical, physicochemical, and physical properties of pyrogenic formations resulting from the burning of previously drained peat soils and the distribution of natural plant species on their surface are considered. Under the influence of precipitation and floodwater alkaline-earth metals are leached; pH values becomes lower; carbon, iron and manganese accumulate in the upper burnt layers. The surface horizons of pyrogenic bodies are sticky, and the burnt peat horizons have a low swelling capacity. In five or six years after the fire, stable plant associations with dominant species are formed on the surface of all pyrogenic formations. The possibility of growing crops on them is doubtful because of their low fertility and secondary swamping.

AB There have been many innovations in mill technologies, oil palm agronomy and pest management over past decades that are increasingly meeting the certification criteria of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). In addition, because oil palm plantations may be functionally analogous to forests, and remain undisturbed for several decades, they can provide some essential ecosystem services to local/national stakeholders in terms of direct use-values (products, economics) and indirect use-values (carbon sequestration, biodegradation, hydrology); though the economic value of indirect services, such as maintenance of water quality, have not been recognized as national assets. On the other hand, option values (gene pools) and existence values (biodiversity) for oil palm plantations are low and loss of these values is contentious when natural systems are converted. Negative perceptions of oil palm being 'eco-friendly' also reflect the extent to which forest and peatland conversion to oil palm have resulted in off-site effects such as carbon mobilization, damage to river systems from sedimentation and loss of biodiversity. It is concluded that the industry could improve its image by adopting mitigation measures, including better landscape design and documentation of the areas under development, and by improving the visibility that some sectors of the industry are making to address these environmental issues.

TI Interaction between the bituminous and humic components of peat
SO SOLID FUEL CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PARAMAGNETISM; METALS; IONS
AB It was established that an increase in the bituminosity of peat with the degree of decomposition can be explained by an exchange interaction between the pi electrons of the molecular polyconjugation systems of humic acids and the quasi-polyconjugation systems of bitumens (the presence of the latter is caused by a synergistic effect of the interaction of separated aromatic rings and the hydrogen bonds of functional groups). This interaction leads to the formation of unique associates, and this fact explains an increase in the concentration of humic substances in a composition with bitumens with increasing the degree of decomposition. The concept of associates is confirmed by a considerable increase in the EPR signal observed upon the removal of a low bitumen content, which was accompanied by changes in its parameters in a number of cases. The formation of these associates occurs under different geoclimatic conditions of peat deposit formation. The lower bituminosity of lowland peats is caused by steric hindrances created by the Ca2+ ions bound to the functional groups of humic substances for the access of hydrocarbon molecules.

TI Excavation-drier method of energy-peat production reduces detrimental
   effects of this process on watercourses
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In Finland, peat is used for energy production, its share being ca. 7% of the total primary energy source in 2006. However, with the increasing use of energy peat, also the detrimental effects on watercourses have received increasing attention. Consequently, to reduce the detrimental effects on watercourses and to minimize the weather risks, Vapo Ltd. started the development of a new excavation-drier peat production method (EDM), in which vegetation cover can be kept intact in the area until the extraction starts, and there is no need for effective drainage of the area. Runoff and water quality were monitored in the study sites located from southern to northern Finland in 2006-2007. The nutrient, suspended solids and DOC loads were greatly reduced using the EDM method, and in some cases the loads were < 1% of corresponding to the milling method when calculated per energy unit produced. The main reason why the EDM method is more "watercourse friendly" is the small extraction area open at one time; usually under 5% of the area of the milling method, when the same amount of energy is produced.

AB We analysed growth strategies (biomass allocation, nutrient sequestration and allocation) of heather (Calluna vulgaris) and purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) seedlings in monocultures and mixtures in relation to N, P, and N + P fertilisation in a greenhouse experiment in order to simulate a heath's pioneer phase under high airborne nitrogen (N) loads. N fertilisation increased the total biomass of both species in monocultures. In mixtures, M. caerulea sequestered about 65% of the N applied, while C. vulgaris suffered from N shortage (halving of the total biomass). Thus, in mixtures only M. caerulea will benefit from airborne N loads, and competition will become increasingly asymmetric with increasing N availability. Our results demonstrate that the heath's pioneer phase is the crucial tipping point at which the competitive vigour of M. caerulea (high belowground allocation, efficient use of belowground resources, shortened reproductive cycles) induces a shift to dominance of grasses under increased N availability.

DT Article
AB Macrofossil remains from dated peat sections help clarify paleoclimate patterns inferred from subtle changes in the palynological data from the northern Russian Far East. These data show latitudinal range extensions for tree Betula. Larix gmelinii, and Picea sp., as well as the occurrence of tree-sized shrubs of Duschekia fruticosa and Salix sp. in areas that today are low shrub tundra. Ages of extralimital taxa suggest a postglacial thermal maximum between similar to 11,000 and 8100 C-14 BP including a region-wide, warm Younger Dryas. This warm interval contrasts to other areas of Siberia where the thermal optimum is similar to 9000-4000 C-14 BP. Additionally, macrofossils suggest that Holocene changes in northern treeline were not synchronous. In the Far East, treeline advance and retreat occurred earlier by similar to 1000 C-14 y and similar to 4000 C-14 y, respectively, as compared to other areas of Russia. Basal and minimum ages of peat deposits indicate that the Early Holocene was a particularly important time for peat initiation and accumulation across northern Siberia.

AB Modem and fossil pollen analyses have established the local vegetation succession and landscape evolution along the Meade River near Atqasuk, Alaska. Three data sets were analyzed: (1) a 142-cm-long peat deposit on the exposed river bluff face, (2) a short, 13-cm peat monolith from the near-surface sediment, and (3) a modem data set of surface samples collected along-a transect representative of a geomorphic gradient of low-center, transitional, and high-center polygons. Pollen-microfossil assemblages changed significantly along this gradient. Detailed analysis of the short pollen profile shows successional vegetation changes over the last 250 years. The long profile, a 9400-year record of past vegetation, indicates that initially, the site was covered by shallow lakes. Eolian activity had a substantial effect on sediment deposition, but a period of rapid peat growth from 8500 to 5000 C-14 year B.P. is coincident with increased vegetation cover of mixed grass-shrub tundra. Following this period, peat growth slowed, and shrub vegetation was replaced by tussock-forming sedge vegetation.

AB An UV-B-exclusion experiment was established in high arctic Zackenberg, Northeast Greenland, to investigate the possible effects of ambient UV-B on plant performance. During almost a whole growing season, canopy gas exchange and Chl fluorescence were measured on Vaccinium uliginosum (bog blueberry). Leaf area, biomass, carbon, nitrogen and UV-B-absorbing compounds were determined from a late season harvest. Compared with the reduced UV-B treatment, the plants in ambient UV-B were found to have a higher content of UV-B-absorbing compounds, and canopy net photosynthesis was as an average 23% lower during the season. By means of the JIP-test, it was found that the potential of processing light energy through the photosynthetic machinery was slightly reduced in ambient UV-B. This indicates that not only the UV-B effects on PSII may be responsible for some of the observed reduction of photosynthesis but also the effects on other parts of the photosynthetic machinery, e.g. the Calvin cycle, might be important. The 60% reduction of the UV-B irradiance used in this study implies a higher relative change in the UV-B load than many of the supplemental experiments do, but the substantial effect on photosynthesis clearly indicates that V. uliginosum is negatively affected by the current level of UV-B.

AB Pollen data were collected from a one-meter peat succession recovered from the top of the Tropea Promontory (Calabria), a territory continuously inhabited throughout Prehistory and Protohistory. The peat was deposited in a small pond/marsh that was gradually filled up. Six C-14 dates allowed the peat growth to be constrained to between ca. 3000 and 1000 calBC. Considerable landscape and land use changes occurred in the area in that time interval, due to both environmental changes and intensive human activities. An open landscape with scattered oak woods characterized the high plain, whereas on the wet soils surrounding the marsh, wet woodlands (Alnus), and hygrophilous vegetation (Cyperaceae) developed, their relative abundance being used to mark the local environmental evolution. The occurrence of different anthropogenic indicators reveals that the area was exploited for agricultural practices (cereal cultivation) and livestock grazing, the latter being the main activity practiced around the marsh between the Eneolithic (stable settlements) and the Early-Middle Bronze Age (seasonal presence). The possibility of climatic influence on the peat evolution was studied by comparisons with well-dated isotope records. The marsh contraction phase roughly coincides with the 4.2 ka calBP event, while the end of peat accumulation postdates the 3.0 ka calBP rapid climate change event.

AB Atlantic white cedar (AWC) stands form peat substrates in association with a seasonally flooded, saturated hydrologic regime. Less than 2% of the AWC swamp land area present during the pre-colonial era remains, and most of the current area now exhibits a temporarily flooded hydrologic regime. The purpose of this study was to quantify radial AWC growth at time scales that were cumulative (throughout ~60-year lifespans) and annual to clarify the relationship with hydrologic regime and climate in drained and undrained stands. Two 60-year-old stands having either drained or undrained conditions were selected in national wildlife refuges in Virginia and North Carolina, USA. Shallow groundwater wells fitted with continuous recorders measured depth-to-water-table during the 1999 calendar year to verify hydrologic regimes, and tree ring widths were evaluated from 54 trees per site. Cumulative time scale growth of individual tree stems was strongly suppressed by high water tables in the undrained stand. Annual growth rates among climate variables also diverged such that wetter months were positively correlated with tree ring width in the drained stand. Results suggest that AWC tree ring growth patterns can provide natural resource managers with insights into historic hydrologic conditions that influence ecosystem services and biodiversity.

AB Peat and gyttja (organic lake sediment) are important indicators for past environmental conditions; they form in areas where the supply of clastic sediment is insufficient to fill the accommodation space. Previous studies of delta sediments, however, have focused mainly on clastic deposits, whereas organics have received only minimal attention. Identification of organic facies can be of value for understanding delta formation as it provides insight into, for example, palaeoenvironmental conditions and compaction susceptibility of these layers. Currently, however, field characteristics of organics are not well-documented for the full range of facies present in delta plains. In this study, a field method a classification key for identifying organic facies in delta plains was developed based on concisely described organic facies in selected cores from the Rhine-Meuse delta, The Netherlands. This method was tested on archived borehole descriptions of the diachronous basal peat layer in the distal Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta; this was done by means of a semi-automated procedure to select and classify samples from a database. The resulting data set was used for mapping organic facies in the basal peat layer by means of indicator kriging and inverse distance weighting. The resulting facies distribution map shows consistent and geologically meaningful patterns, which were interpreted in terms of hydrological regimes. The formation of the basal peat layer, which marks the onset of Holocene aggradation, has been controlled by marine-dominated, fluvial-dominated and seepage-dominated environments. Before 9000 cal yr bp, marine processes influenced the initial stage of organic accumulation in the western part of The Netherlands. After 9000 cal yr bp, on the flanks of topographical higher regions, seepage-dominated mesotrophic organic facies characterized the onset of accumulation. Simultaneously, nutrient-rich organic facies could develop in the Rhine-Meuse valley: gyttja formed in the sediment-limited Meuse realm, whereas reed peat accumulated in the Rhine realm, indicating lower water depths and thus a higher elevated surface level. It is concluded that the classification key for identifying organic facies is a strong tool to better recognize peat and gyttja types on the basis of macroscopic field characteristics. Application of the key on archived boreholes also proved to be feasible. Identification of organic facies and determination of their spatial distribution at delta scale, as is shown in this study, contributes to understanding delta evolution.

AB In this study, n-alkane and isoprenoid, saturated and aromatic biomarker distributions of Miocene coals in the can (canakkale) region, were studied to investigate organic geochemical characteristics, depositional environment, and hydrocarbon potential of these coals.
   can formation (Middle Miocene) unconformably overlies the basement can volcanites (Upper Oligocene-Lower Miocene). This formation is composed of lignite, clayey lignite, and ligniferous clayey levels of various thicknesses interlayering with clay and tuffite. The formation represents sediments of small lacustrine basins that are isolated by faults that are formed contemporaneously with Early-Middle Eocene volcanism. Coaliferous units are overlain by lower agglomerate levels.
   The Rock Eval analyses show that the average TOC (Total Organic Carbon) content of the coal is 53.71% and the average HI (Hydrogen Index) value is 180.5 mgHC/gTOC. OI (Oxygen Index) values (avg. 22.33 mgCO(2)/gTOC) show that the depositional environment of peat deposits is suboxic. According to HI-Tmax, S-2-TOC classification diagrams and Pr/n-C-17 vs. Ph/n-C-18 diagram, the organic matter is composed of Type II and Type III kerogen mixing and represents a transitional environment. In gas chromatograms, n-alkanes with high, mostly odd-numbered carbons are dominant and they are associated with a slight algal contribution. CPI22-30 (Carbon Preference Index) and TAR(HC) (Terrigenous/Aquatic Ratio) values indicate a dominance of high-carbon numbered n-alkanes, indicating the presence of terrestrial organic matter.
   P-aq (aquatic plant n-alkane proxy) values (0.2; 0.3) indicate a climate with relatively wet conditions or low precipitation, the presence of emergent macrophyteses, and the scarcity of hydrophilic plants. Pwax (vascular plant n-alkane proxy) ratio (0.8; 0.7) shows moderately wet conditions and a relatively low water level.
   The TOC, ACL (n-alkane average chain length), Q(wood/grass), Q(wood/plant), and Q(grass/plant) values indicate the presence of woody plants in a peat bog and relatively wet and moderately warm climate conditions.
   Based on DBT/P (dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene) ratio, sample c-2 points to the character of marine shale and other lacustrines whereas sample c-6 indicates fluvial/deltaic depositional environment.
   Overall, 20S/(20R + 20S), beta beta/(alpha alpha+beta beta) sterane, 22S/(22R + 22S) homohopane, and moretane/hopane ratios that reflect the maturity of organic matter are indicative of immature organic matter. MA(I)/MA(I + II), TA(I)/TA(I + II) and C28TA/(C29MA + C28TA) steroid, MPI, MPR, and MDR ratios calculated from aromatic biomarkers are quite low, which indicate an immature nature.
   The n-alkane, saturated and aromatic biomarker data on the can coals reveal that deposition should have taken place in a terrestrial environment changing from lacustrine to fluvial under predominately suboxic-oxic and acidic conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using a high resolution C-14 chronology, delta(13)C values and organic carbon content, from loess/paleosol and peat profiles in China, we can demonstrate century scale warm-cold East Asian monsoon paleoclimatic fluctuation events and significant precipitation variability within the last deglaciation. The major climatic events recognized are the Bolling (1 300-12 500 a B. P.), Older Dryas (12 500-11 750 a B. P.), Allerod (11 750-11 200 a B. P.) and Younger Dryas (11 200-10 000 a B. P.). The stratigraphic structure of the last deglaciation sediments is characterized by frequent changes in sedimentation phases reflecting climatic instability. These high frequency, rapid climatic events can correlate with fluctuations recorded by sea surface temperatures in the Norwegian Sea. This indicates a pale oclimate teleconnection between polar, high latitude areas and East Asian monsoon areas through westerlies and the related atmospheric pressure system.

Results showed that G. herbaceum seedlings can survive in all treatments, but T. paniculatum seedlings died out in 75% and 100% SMR substrates where higher electrical conductance was found (2.3-2.7 dS m(-1)). Both growth and biomass mostly declined with the increase of SMR proportion in the growing media for the two species except for root biomass in T. paniculatum seedlings between the control and the 25% SMR treatment. Shoot nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and contents tended to be higher in low- and high-SMR-proportional substrates, respectively. N and P statuses were both diagnosed to be excessive than needed for the two species. Overall, it was not recommended to culture G. herbaceum seedlings in the substrates with SMR; instead T. paniculatum seedlings can be cultured in the growing media with SMR in volumetric proportion of 25%.

AB We measured flocculation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water from a humic lake (DOC = 14.9 mg C L-1) and from an adjacent mire (DOC = 25.7 mg C L-1), in in situ enclosure experiments with different light regimes. Light stimulated the formation of organic particles in both waters, and organic particle formation was observed at all incubation depths, even in the dark controls. Production of phytoplankton biomass was negligible, and allochthonous DOC was the most important precursor of the sinking particles. 8-22% and 25-60% of the loss of DOC in lake and mire water, respectively, could be accounted for by flocculation. Depth-integrated flocculation based on the enclosure experiments was 14.7 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Lake-water DOC concentration and water color has been increasing during the last decade, and sediment trap studies show that gross sedimentation of organic carbon also increased. Thus flocculation of allochthonous DOC, stimulated by light, constitutes a pathway for the sequestration of carbon in lake sediments.

AB In this review, technical and economically viable potentials for carbon sequestration in the agricultural soils of Europe by 2008-2012 are analysed against a business-as-usual scenario. We provide a quantitative estimation of the carbon absorption potential per hectare and the surface of agricultural land that is available and suitable for the implementation of those measures, their environmental effects as well as the effects on farm income. Realistically, agricultural soils in EU-15 can sequester up to 16-19 Mt C year(-1) during the first Kyoto commitment period (2008-2012), which is less than one fifth of the theoretical potential and equivalent to 2% of European anthropogenic emissions. We identified as most promising measures: the promotion of organic inputs on arable land instead of grassland, the introduction of perennials (grasses, trees) on arable set-aside land for conservation or biofuel purposes, to promote organic farming, to raise the water table in fanned peatland, and-with restrictions-zero tillage or conservation tillage. Many options have environmental benefits but some risk of increasing N2O emissions. For most measures it is impossible to determine the overall impact on farm profitability. Efficient carbon sequestration in agricultural soils demands a permanent management change and implementation concepts adjusted to local soil, climate and management features in order to allow selection of areas with high carbon sequestering potential. Some of the present agricultural policy schemes have probably helped to maintain carbon stocks in agricultural soils. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cultivated organic soils make a significant contribution to phosphorus (P) leaching losses from agricultural land, despite occupying a small proportion of cultivated area. However, less is known about P mobilisation processes and the P forms present in peat soils compared with mineral soils. In this study, P forms and their distribution with depth were investigated in two cultivated Histosol profiles, using a combination of wet chemical extraction and P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy.
   Both profiles had elevated P content in the topsoil, amounting to around 40 mmol kg(-1), and P speciation in both profiles was strongly dominated by organic P. Topsoils were particularly rich in organic P (P-org), with relative proportions of up to 80%. Inorganic P in the profiles was almost exclusively adsorbed to surface reactive aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe) minerals. In one of the pro-files, small contributions of Ca-phosphates were detected.
   A commonly used P saturation index (PSI) based on ammonium-oxalate extraction indicated a low to moderate risk of P leaching from both profiles. However, the capacity of soil Al and Fe to retain P in organic soils could be reduced by high competition from organic compounds for sorption sites. This is not directly accounted for in PSI and similar indices.
   Accumulation of P-org in the topsoil may be attributable by microbial peat decomposition and transformation of mineral fertiliser P by both microbiota and crops. Moreover, high carbon-phosphorus ratio in the surface peat material in both profiles suggests reduced net mineralisation of P-org in the two soils. However, advancing microbial peat decomposition will eventually lead to complete loss of peat horizons and to mineralisation of P-org. Hence, P-org in both profiles represents a huge potentially mobilised P pool.

AB Biotite is a potassium rich mineral, which is used as a fertilizer in organic farming and as a soil amendment in conventional farming. Its ability to reduce (134)Cs uptake by ryegrass from peat soil was studied in pot experiments and compared with zeolite, heavy clay, bentonite and apatite. In addition, the long-term effect of biotite on (137)Cs uptake from peat soil was studied in the peat field.
   In the pot experiments in the first cut of ryegrass, the minerals decreased (134)Cs uptake by plants in the following order: zeolite > heavy clay > bentonite > biotite > apatite. Apatite did not have any effect on the plant (134)Cs level. In the later cuts, the uptake of (134)Cs from biotite-treated soil decreased further while that from soils treated with other minerals remained unchanged or even increased. In general, (134)Cs uptake by plants decreased with increasing mineral level. The decrease of (134)Cs uptake became more efficient, especially at the early growth stage, by mixing small amounts of zeolite in biotite. The results of the field experiment indicated the long-term effect of biotite on reducing (134)Cs uptake by plants. Biotite application rate was 30 t ha(-1). The five-year mean of the plant/soil concentration ratio of (137)Cs was 0.05 for biotite-treated soil, in contrast to 0.14 for the control soil. On the whole, biotite reduced considerably the (137)Cs level of plants on peat soil and this effect was long-lasting. For an effective reduction of plant radiocesium a great quantity of biotite is needed and therefore it is most suitable for greenhouse cultivation where contaminated slightly decomposed peat is used as a growing medium.

AB Shifts in oxic and anoxic conditions in soil are most frequently caused by water table fluctuations, heavy rain, snowmelt or flooding, with potentially significant impacts on microbial processes and the ability of soils to convert mineral nitrogen to nitrogen gases efficiently. The impact of oxic/anoxic cycles on nitrogen transformation rates was therefore explored in the upper layer (0-30 cm) of partially degraded peat soil. We hypothesized that high denitrification potential would be conserved due to the high organic matter content of this soil. Mineral nitrogen was applied to approximately 1-cm deep layers of homogenized soil in microcosms, with no external source of readily degradable carbon. Microcosms were subjected to three cycles, each consisting of an oxic phase of 8-11 days and an anoxic phase of 21-28 days. Approximately 2% of the ammonium load was lost through ammonia volatilization during oxic phases and the remainder was nitrified. The accumulated nitrate decreased soil pH from 8.0 to 6.8 before its transformation through denitrification. Nitrification and denitrification rates during the three oxic/anoxic cycles (approximately three months) were 2.9-3.2 kg N ha(-1) d(-1) and 1.0-2.3 kg N ha(-1) d(-1), respectively. Extrapolation of these values to 30-cm deep soil layers gave rates that were sufficient for complete transformation of at least 1700 kg N ha(-1) of ammonium to nitrogen gases, which is ten-fold greater than the annual nitrogen application of 170 kg N ha(-1) permitted by the European directive. Denitrification rates decreased linearly during the three cycles (from 36 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 1 mu g N g(-1) d(-1) dry soil), projecting cessation of denitrification activity and CO2 production during the fifth cycle. Storage of peat soil at 4 degrees C most probably allowed slow degradation of organic matter that was completely oxidized to CO2 after the soil was exposed to higher temperature (28 degrees C). Storage of soil for one year did not affect nitrification rate, but reduced denitrification rate, unless soil was amended with a readily degradable carbon source. The data suggest that, despite the high carbon content of this soil, it cannot sustain transformations of high N loads to nitrogen gases for prolonged periods without amendment with readily available carbon.

AB Phosphorus loading to the Everglades from nearby agricultural areas has become a major concern, and is considered to be a significant factor in the encroachment of cattail (Typha domingensis Pers.) and other rapidly growing vegetation into endemic sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) marsh. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the variability in turnover of organic C in plant and soil detrital pools along a P enrichment gradient in an Everglades marsh and to identify substrate characteristics and environmental factors controlling C turnover. Potential rates of C mineralization in plant Litter and peat were determined by measuring aerobic and anaerobic microbial respiration under controlled conditions in laboratory incubations. Potential C mineralization decreased with depth and, consequently, substrate age, in the plant-soil profile. Within individual detrital pools [standing dead plant material, soil litter layer, surface peat (0-10 cm depth) and subsurface peat (10-30 cm depth)], potential C mineralization decreased down gradient from the source of nutrient loading to WCA-ZA. Overall, 91% of the variability in aerobic C mineralization in peat and plant litter was accounted for by substrate P concentration and lignocellulose composition. Anaerobic C mineralization rates were consistently about one-third of aerobic rates. Results indicated that organic C turnover in detrital pools in WCA-2A is significantly affected by accelerated P loading, but is also controlled by O-2 availability and substrate C quality.

AB Elemental (C, N, Pb) and isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) measurements of cored sediment from a small bog in northern New Mexico reveal changes in climate during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Abrupt increases in Pb concentration and delta C-13 values ca. 14 420 cal. YBP indicate significant runoff to the shallow lake that existed at that time. Weathering and transport of local volcanic rocks resulted in the delivery of Pb-bearing minerals to the basin, while a C-13-enriched terrestrial vegetation source increased the delta C-13 values of the sedimentary material. Wet conditions developed over a 300 a period and lasted for a few hundred years. The Younger Dryas period (ca. 12 700-11 500 cal. YBP) caused a reduction in terrestrial productivity reflected in decreasing C/N values, delta N-15 values consistently greater than 0 parts per thousand and low organic content. By contrast, aquatic productivity increased during the second half of this period, evidenced by increasing delta C-13 values at the time of highest abundance of algae. Dry conditions ca. 8000-6 000 cal. YBP were characterised by low organic carbon content and high Pb concentrations, the latter suggesting enhanced erosion and aeolian transport of volcanic rock. The range in delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N values in the sedimentary record fall within the range of modern plants, except during the periods of runoff and drought. The sedimentary record provides evidence of natural climate variability in northern New Mexico, including short- (multi-centennial) and long-(millennial) term episodes during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.

AB A Middle Pennsylvanian tuff bed (the Belka bed) in the roof of the Lower Radnice Coal bears To peat-forming vegetation preserved in growth position. This vegetation has been studied in detail at the 12 hectares large Oval coal deposit in the southern part of the Radnice Basin. Documentation of the fossil record in six excavations and that previously collected in the former opencast mine allowed for a detailed reconstruction of the local peat-forming lepidodendrid-cordaitalean forest structured into well-developed stories. It consists of about 33 species, which colonized the occasionally flooded planar peat swamp precursor of the Lower Radnice Coal. The canopy story of this vegetation was dominated by Lepidodendron (Paralycopodites) simile, L lycopodioides, Lepidophloios acerosus and Cordaites borassifolius. They formed a relatively dense canopy, locally interrupted with significant gaps allowing development of a rich groundcover that together with liana-like plants represents the most diverse part of the forest. A less diverse understory composed of calamites, medullosan pteridosperms and Psaronius tree ferns displays a patchy distribution pattern presumably related to density of the canopy. The minimal area that sufficiently represents the pattern of this forest phytocoenosis is estimated to be about 200 m(2), although lower stories are well represented even within much smaller areas of about 60 m(2). Slight heterogeneity in the population density of dominant taxa (Cordaites vs. lepidodendrid lycopsids) was documented across the Oval coal deposit. The fossil record of the Balka tuff bed also indicates that the coal-forest colonizing the peat swamp prior the generation of forest killed by volcanic ash fall, was destroyed, presumably due to long-lasting flooding and thus suggests that catastrophic events were probably a relatively common part of the evolution of peat-forming Pennsylvanian successions.

Quantitative results support the following model: Initial stages of peat accumulation in the ancient swamp were dominated by aerial debris from vegetation growing near the swamp margin. Through this debris grew an assemblage of plants dominated by the lycophyte Chalaneria cormosa. There was a gradual transition to an assemblage dominated by a pteridosperm and tree fern canopy with numerous gymnospermous and pteridophytic subcanopy species, and extensive herbaceous ground cover of the zygopterid fern Corynepteris. Late stages of ecological succession were dominated by Psaronius tree ferns.

AB QuestionUnderstorey development is a great challenge in the restoration of many forest sites, particularly when sources of vegetation propagules are scarce. Can placement of propagule-rich soil patches within reclaimed landscapes otherwise covered with propagule-poor material promote the dispersal of vegetation from the patches into the surrounding areas?
   LocationLarge reclamation site in the Canadian (Alberta) boreal forest.
   MethodPatches of propagule-rich forest floor material were placed within a matrix of propagule-poor peat material. Vegetation assessments (cover estimates, seed rain) were done surrounding these patches in the third and fourth growing seasons.
   ResultsThere was significant egress of species from the patches into the peat after four growing seasons, and overall species associated with the patches had higher cover in the peat than species that were associated with the peat itself. While wind-dispersed herbaceous species from the patches were found at the leading edge of the egressing community, most species used vegetative propagation, resulting in short egress distances. Several patch-associated species were found in seed rain collected on the peat areas but were not observed in this material, suggesting seedbed limitations.
   ConclusionDespite the relatively short distance of egress, this experiment suggests that placement of propagule-rich soil material within reclaimed landscapes will promote egress into adjacent propagule-poor soil material.

AB The anastomosing system of the upper Narew River consists of a network of interconnected channels. The channels are relatively deep (width/depth ratio 2-10), straight to sinuous, and they lack natural levees. They are characterised by a low water slope and very low stream power. The river is distinctly bedload-dominated and the transport of suspended clastic fines is minimal. Channel deposits consist almost exclusively of medium- to coarse-grained sand. Laterally extensive interchannel areas are flat and covered with,peat-forming vegetation. These stable wetlands are flooded for many weeks during high water stages. Except for the channels, the valley fill consists of peat layer reaching 4 m in thickness. The rate of vertical aggradation of the peat deposit is estimated at 1-1.5 mm/year. The radiocarbon dating indicates that the peat layer is predominantly late Holocene in age. The impact of vegetation on the system is overwhelming. Vegetation produces an erosion-resistant peat layer, stabilizes channel banks and slows down the. water flow. Vegetation also stimulates aggradation of bedload material on the channel bottom, and contributes to avulsion by blocking the channels. The channel network owes its origin to repeated though infrequent avulsion. Avulsion in the,studied system is a small-scale, gradational and slow process. New channels evolve very slowly because of unfavourable hydrologic conditions and the presence of a resistant peat substratum. A new channel eventually intercepts only a part of the flow, while the old channel is still active, though to a limited extent. Although newly formed channels might subsequently be abandoned, long-lasting ones predominate within the system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SOIL PIPES; CATCHMENT; RECONNAISSANCE; STRATIGRAPHY; THROUGHFLOW;
   PIPEFLOW; MODEL
AB Natural soil pipes are common and significant in upland blanket peat catchments yet there are major problems in finding and defining the subsurface pipe networks. This is particularly important because pipeflow can contribute a large proportion of runoff to the river systems in these upland environments and may significantly influence catchment sediment and solute yields. Traditional methods such as digging soil pits are destructive and time-consuming (particularly in deep peat) and only provide single point sources of information. This paper presents results from an experiment to assess the use of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to remotely sense pipes in blanket peat. The technique is shown to be successful in identifying most of the pipes tested in the pilot catchment. Comparison of data on pipes identified by GPR and verified by manual measurement suggests that pipes can be located in the soil profile with a depth accuracy of 20 to 30 cm. GPR-identified pipes were found throughout the soil profile. however, those within 10-20 cm of the surface could not be identified using the 100 or 200 MHz antennae due to multiple surface reflections. Generally pipes smaller than 10 cm in diameter could not be identified using the technique although modifications are suggested that will allow enhanced resolution. Future work would benefit from the development of dual-frequency antennae that will allow the combination of high-resolution data with the depth of penetration required in a wetland environment. The GPR experiment shows that pipe network densities were much greater than could be detected from surface observation alone. Thus, GPR provides a non-destructive. fast technique which can produce continuous profiles of peat depth and indicate pipe locations across survey transects. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

   treatment wetlands
AB The South Florida Water Management District (District) is conducting research focused on potential advanced treatment technologies to support reduction of phosphorus (P) loads in surface water entering the remaining Everglades. Periphyton-based stormwater treatment areas (PSTA) are one of the advanced treatment technologies being researched by the District. This detailed research and demonstration project is being conducted in two phases. Basic research in field-based mesocosm experiments was conducted during the first phase within the District's Everglades Nutrient Removal Project (ENR). Studies were conducted in 24 portable PSTA mesocosms and three of the south ENR test cells. Phase 1 studies addressed the effects of system substrate (shellrock, organic peat, or sand), water depth, hydraulic loading rate, vegetation presence, depth:width ratio, and inhibition of algal growth on total phosphorus removal performance of the PSTA mesocosms. A second phase of research is currently under way, during which PSTA feasibility will be evaluated further in four field-scale constructed mesocosms totaling about 2 ha, and follow up studies within the ENR test cells and portable mesocosms will be conducted to further investigate the effects of other inorganic substrates, shallow water depth, and velocity on treatment performance. Phase 1 monitoring has determined that periphyton-dominated communities can be established in constructed wetlands within 5 months. The algal component of these periphyton plant communities is characteristic of natural Everglades periphyton. High macrophyte densities resulted from use of peat soils in PSTA mesocosms, while shellrock and sand soils promoted more desirable sparse macrophyte stands. P removal rates under the conditions of this research were relatively high considering the low influent total P concentrations tested (average 23 mug/L). PSTA mesocosms on shellrock soils were able to attain long-term average outflow total P concentrations as low as 11 mug/L. The maximum one-parameter TP first-order removal rate constant (k(1)) measured was 27 m/y. Minimum attainable outflow total P concentrations and mass removals appear to be the result of a balance between internal P loading from antecedent soils, uptake and burial processes in new sediments, and rainfall inputs. A different soil type (limerock) will be tested for effectiveness during Phase 2. Selected existing treatments will also be continued to look for trends over a second growing season.

AB A high-resolution lacustrine-peat record from the desert-loess transitional zone in Northern China was obtained to reconstruct Holocene environmental change in the region. AMS C-14 dates are used to provide a chronology. The results indicate that the site was a desert environment before 12.2 cal kyr BP, and was then occupied by a paleolake which started to shrink, with a wetland occurring from 6.2 to 3.0 cal kyr BP. Subsequently, the site became a seasonally water-filled depression. Based on the lithology and measurements of grain size and total organic carbon content, the climate changed from arid to humid at 12.2 cal kyr BP, and became more humid after 8.3 cal kyr BP. From 6.2 to 3.0 cal kyr BP, precipitation decreased but the climate remained at an optimum. After 3.0 cal kyr BP, the climate was dry overall but with several humid intervals. A comparison of paleoclimatic records from lacustrine and aeolian deposits from the region reveals a discrepancy about the nature of the early Holocene climate, and we conclude that this is because lacustrine sediments responded more sensitively to precipitation than aeolian deposits when the temperature was low. The environmental evolution of the region was synchronous with changes in the Asian summer monsoon (ASM), but temperature also played a key role in the early Holocene.

AB PRE herbicides have been reported to injure both the foliage and roots of hybrid bermudagrass turf established in sand culture. Research was conducted to evaluate the influence of reed-sedge peat moss (RSPM) on hybrid bermudagrass injury following PRE herbicide applications to plants established in sand culture. Washed sod plugs were established in mini-rhizotrons constructed with sand root-zones varying in organic carbon content (0.000, 0.003, 0.007, and 0.012 kg kg(-1)). Herbicide treatments included indaziflam (35 and 52.5 g ai ha(-1)) and prodiamine (840 g ai ha(-1)). Significant foliar injury was only observed with indaziflam at 52.5 g ha(-1). When applied to plants in sand with no detectable (0.000 kg kg(-1)) organic carbon, foliar injury measured 61% by 6 wk after treatment. Comparatively, injury with indaziflam at 52.5 g ha(-1) was reduced by 40% with applications to plants established in sand with 0.007 kg kg(-1) organic carbon. Root length, root length density, and root surface area were greatest in sand-based root zones with >= 0.007 kg kg(-1) organic carbon regardless of herbicide treatment; however, only indaziflam (52.5 g ha(-1)) and prodiamine-treated plants exhibited diminished root parameters relative to the nontreated check. Data in the current study illustrate that RSPM can affect above- and belowground injury following PRE herbicide applications to hybrid bermudagrass in sand root-zones.

AB Centuries of anthropogenic releases have releases in a global legacy of mercury (Hg) contamination. Here we use a global model to quantify the impact of uncertainty in Hg atmospheric emissions and cycling -On anthropogenic enrichment and discuss implications for future Hg levels. The plausibility of sensitivity simulations is evaluated against multiple independent lines of Observation, including natural archives and direct measurements of present-day environmental Hg concentrations. It has been previously reported that pre-industriaVenrichment recorded in sediment and peat disagree by more than a factor of 10. We find this difference is largely erroneous and caused by comparing peat and sediment against different reference time periods. After correcting this inconsistenr-yi, median enrichment in Hg accumulation since pre-industrial 1760 to 1880 is a factor of 4.3 for peat and 3.0 for sediment. Pre-industrial accumulation in peat and sediment is a factor of greater than the precolonial era (3000-BC to 1550 AD). Model scenarios that omit atmospheric emissions of Hg,froin early mining are inconsistent with observational constraints on the present-day atmospheric, oceanic, and soil Hg reservoirs, as well as the magnitude of enrichment in archives. Future reductions in anthropogenic emissions will initiate a decline in atmospheric concentrations within 1 year, but stabilization of subsurface and deep oaearr Hg levels requires aggressive controls. These findings are robust to the ranges of uncertainty in past emissions arid Hg cycling.

AB Wetland peats were analyzed for their potential to consume and produce carbon monoxide (CO) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Kinetic and functional characteristics of anaerobic CO consumption were compared with those of methanogenesis. Inhibitors of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction decreased the rate of CO consumption by 30 and 20%, respectively, suggesting that methanogens and sulfate reducers played secondary roles in CO uptake. Low concentrations of nitrate (0.2 mM) stimulated CO uptake? while high concentrations (20 mM) were partially inhibitory. Sulfate (20 mM), ferric iron (60 mu mol cm(-3)), and acetate (10 mM) had no effect on CO consumption. Formate and glucose (10 mM) temporarily stimulated net CO and H(2) production. Aerobic incubations of previously anaerobic peat stimulated transient CO production. Kinetic analysis of anaerobic CO consumption by two sediment types (organic peal and mineral silt) showed that maximum potential uptake velocities (V(maxp)) in each sediment were similar, 1-2 nmol CO cm(-3) sediment h(-1), with apparent half saturation constants (K(app)) ranging from 5 to 37 nM CO. Anaerobic CO consumption may limit CO accumulation in wetland peats and sediments, thereby affecting CO emissions. Understanding the role and characteristics of wetland CO consumption may help explain current and future patterns in wetland CO dynamics. (C) 1999 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB The European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive stipulates that only biofuel systems that achieve greenhouse gas emission savings of 60% will be eligible to be considered for the 2020 target of 10% renewable energy in transport. Rape seed biodiesel is a very popular indigenous European biofuel; however, this 60% target is very challenging for the biofuel produced. Tropical biofuels such as palm oil biodiesel tend to be sustainable, due to use of residues and byproduct to satisfy parasitic energy demands. This paper explores, through life cycle assessment methodologies, the whole rape seed system and the potential to improve sustainability. Allocation by energy content attributes almost half the greenhouse gas emissions to rape cake (a coproduct). Indeed rape cake as animal feed displaces imported soybean from Latin America and potential destruction to rain forests. Together with use of glycerol as a source of heat, greenhouse gas savings of 75% maybe attained, indicating a sustainable system. Furthermore use of rape straw pellets in lieu of the environmentally unsound practice of using peat produced from Irish Bogs as a source of domestic heating can lead to a 135% savings on diesel. Interestingly, rape cake as a source of biomethane greatly improves the energy balance of the system but is of little benefit to emissions.

AB The impacts of different growing substrate compositions, consisting of peat (PM), peat substituted with 30% green fibre (G30) and coco coir fibre (CC) growth media, were investigated in regard to the plant height, biomass and floral yield, biomass nitrogen (N) content, root growth, and cannabidiol content (CBD/A) of two phytocannabinoid-rich cannabis genotypes in an indoor pot cultivation system. Genotypes and substrate treatment combinations were randomly allocated to 36 plants according to a Latin square design. The results showed a higher total plant height for PM (39.96 cm), followed by G30 (35.28 cm), and the lowest in CC (31.54 cm). The N content of leaves indicated the highest values for plants grown in G30 (52.24 g kg DW-1), followed by PM (46.75 g kg DW-1) and a significantly lower content for CC (37.00 g kg DW-1). Root length density (RLD) increased by 40% (PM) and 50% (G30), compared to CC treatments, with no significant differences in root dry weight. Both genotypes, Kanada (KAN) and 0.2x, reacted in a genotype-specific manner. KAN indicated a reduced floral yield of plants grown in G30 (4.94 g plant(-1)) and CC (3.84 g plant(-1)) compared to PM (8.56 g plant(-1)). 0.2x indicated stable high floral yields of 9.19 g plant(-1) (G30) to 7.90 g plant(-1) (CC). Leaf DW increased in PM (5.78 g plant(-1)) and G30 (5.66 g plant(-1)) compared to CC (3.30 g plant(-1)), while CBD/A content remained constant. Due to a higher biomass yield, the CBD/A yield of flowers (549.66 mg plant(-1)) and leaves (224.16 mg plant(-1)) revealed 0.2x as an interesting genotype for indoor pot cultivation in a peat-based substrate substituted with 30% green fibres. Overall, the demand for organic green fibres to partly replace fractionated peat showed a genotype-specific option for a homogeneous plant development, with comparable high biomass yields and stable cannabinoid contents compared to a peat containing standard substrate.

AB Several Mio-Pliocene aged lignite seams occur as part of a non-marine transgressive sequence in the Elhovo graben in southeastern Bulgaria. The present study is focused on 45 samples collected from three boreholes in the eastern part of the basin. Petrographic data along with ash and sulphur contents were used in order to determine the lateral and vertical variations of the coal facies and depositional environment of the Elhovo lignite.
   The lignite seams accumulated in a rheotrophic, low-lying mire with high pH value and are characterized by high ash yields and sulphur contents. Despite of the neutral to weakly alkaline environment the bacterial activity was limited and the tissue preservation and gelification were mainly controlled by the redox conditions.
   Vegetation rich in decay resistant conifers dominated in the Elhovo basin together with mesophytic angiosperm species. The absence of algal remains and sapropelic coal indicated that open water areas were not present during peat accumulation. The latter processed in an environment, characterized by low subsidence rate, in which prior to the burial the woods were subjected to severe mechanical destruction. According to our interpretation, the enhanced impregnation of the tissues bacteria and fungi played only a secondary role in the process of humification. The lignite from borehole 122 and partly from BH 145 deposited in an environment characterized by relatively low (ground)water table, whereas to the south an area dominated by a flooded forest swamp (BH 104) formed. This is suggested by the better tissue preservation and gelification of the organic matter in BH 104. The vertical variation of the maceral composition in the studied lignite is interpreted as a consequence of vegetational changes, rather than to changes in the depositional environment. The low contents of inertinite macerals indicate that despite of the low water level the environment was relatively wet and the thermal and oxidative destruction of the tissues was limited.
   Peat accumulation was terminated by a major flooding event and a short term establishment of a lake. In contrast to the West Maritsa basin, no seam formed in the Elhovo basin during the filling stage of the lake. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Thicker snowpacks and their insulation effects cause winter-warming and invoke thaw of permafrost ecosystems. Temperature-dependent decomposition of previously frozen carbon (C) is currently considered one of the strongest feedbacks between the Arctic and the climate system, but the direction and magnitude of the net C balance remains uncertain. This is because winter effects are rarely integrated with C fluxes during the snow-free season and because predicting the net C balance from both surface processes and thawing deep layers remains challenging. In this study, we quantified changes in the long-term net C balance (net ecosystem production) in a subarctic peat plateau subjected to 10 years of experimental winter-warming. By combining(210)Pb and(14)Cdating of peat cores with peat growth models, we investigated thawing effects on year-round primary production and C losses through respiration and leaching from both shallow and deep peat layers. Winter-warming and permafrost thaw had no effect on the net C balance, but strongly affected gross C fluxes. Carbon losses through decomposition from the upper peat were reduced as thawing of permafrost induced surface subsidence and subsequent waterlogging. However, primary production was also reduced likely due to a strong decline in bryophytes cover while losses from the old C pool almost tripled, caused by the deepened active layer. Our findings highlight the need to estimate long-term responses of whole-year production and decomposition processes to thawing, both in shallow and deep soil layers, as they may contrast and lead to unexpected net effects on permafrost C storage.

AB Due to their location close to the northern border of Romania, their complex glacial geomorphology and the existing biodiversity, the Maramures Mountains represent an interesting area. Despite this, few palynological studies have been published so far about these mountains. Recent pollen analyses performed in Taul Mare-Bardau and Cristina peat bogs, both located in the Northern Maramures Mountains, reveal the Holocene regional vegetation history, beginning with the Atlantic period, as confirmed by C-14 dating. High values of Corylus avellana in the bottom part of both sequences suggests an Atlantic age for the beginning of the peat accumulation. Picea abies values indicate its significant presence in the region, continuing through the entire sequence. The development of P. abies and C. avellana forest is assumed to have occurred between 9800 and 9000 cal BP, based on the general trend in the Romanian Carpathians, even though this interval is not covered by the pollen diagrams from the Maramures Mountains. Mixed oak elements appear under-represented in the sequences because of the high altitude of the sites, similar to Carpinus betulus, whose continuous curve shows small values. The spread of mixed oak elements occurred at around 10,800 cal BP, as in most regions of the Romanian Carpathians. The Fagus sylvatica curve reaches high values during the Subatlantic period, certifying its substantial and early presence in the region. Abies alba pollen occurs continuously in the diagram only during the last period (Subatlantic), and it is poorly represented compared to beech. The beginning of C betulus expansion is dated at ca. 6000 cal BP in Maramures Mountains, whereas F. sylvatica starts to expand at ca. 5100 cal BP, and A. alba at only 2500-3200 cal BP. The decrease in AP/NAP ratio, observed in the last pollen zones, reflects the increasing human intervention in the region, mostly by clearing and cutting of spruce and beech forests.

AB The effect of artificial shoot clipping on the vegetative growth and sexual reproduction of the evergreen bearberry, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, and the deciduous bog bilberry, Vaccinium uliginosum, was studied in the vicinity of a copper-nickel smelter in SW Finland. According to the research hypothesis, heavy metal induced shoot death breaks the apical dominance in the clones growing in a polluted environment. This causes activation of dormant axillary and adventitious buds and an increase in branching on the older parts of the stem. Regrowth after shoot death was studied by clipping off all the current-year shoots from experimental branches in autumn (1994) and spring (1995). Within-clone and between-clone control branches were used to test the data.
   Both species displayed a considerable ability to activate dormant meristems after the damage. Regrowth of the current shoots during the next growing season (1995) was about 80% compared to the within-clone control in both species after autumn clipping. Shoot clipping in early summer was more detrimental for both species, and the regrowth of A. uva-ursi was less than that of V. uliginosum. Differences in the storage reserves and source-sink mechanisms of carbon allocation between evergreen and deciduous species probably explain their distinct response. When the removed biomass was added to the living biomass of the branches, there was overcompensation in the total dry weight of A. uva-ursi after autumn clipping, and the weight was almost 90% of the control after spring clipping. The total dry weight of V. uliginosum also equalled that of the control when the removed biomass was added. No berries developed on either species in the year following the autumn treatment, because clipping removed all the flower buds. Spring clipping had no effect on the sexual reproduction of A. uva-ursi, but decreased the berry production of V. uliginosum. The degree of compensatory growth of both species was only slightly affected by the distance from the smelter. It is suggested that dormant bud activation, rapid regrowth and plastic branching contribute to the resistance mechanism to heavy metals.

   NORFOLK; ENGLAND; WATER; ROCKS
AB 'Uranium, lead, and sulphur data for a Middle Pleistocene interglacial peat deposit from Norfolk, UK, suggest that uptake of these elements was synchronous and confined to a single early diagenetic episode, probably coeval with peat formation. Sulphur isotope data indicate that reducing conditions have been maintained within the deposit throughout its history. Both uranium and lead concentration profiles show a marked discontinuity near the middle of the bed, probably indicating an environmental change, possibly emergence. The lead isotope data an compatible with a single lead component below the discontinuity and two components above. Groundwater is thought to be the dominant source of lead with an additional airfall component present in the upper peat. The uranium and lead concentration profiles below the discontinuity and the sulfur isotope profile throughout the pear support the view that these elements were sequestered from upwelling groundwaters.
   The organic material is particularly suitable for Th-230/U-238 dating because it contains a negligible allogenic mineral component and very low Th-232 activity. A sequence of consistent ages through the peat profile (mean 317 +/- 14 ka) over a wide range of uranium concentrations (7-65 mg g(-1)), strongly suggests that a discrete, short-lived, uranium-uptake event has been dated and that subsequent differential isotopic migration has not occurred. One sample, from immediately below the discontinuity, has an infinite apparent age, but there is strong evidence for sequestration of uranium from the peat into adjacent wood fragments found along the discontinuity. Calculated initial U-234/U-238 values of 1.2-1.3 support a groundwater origin for the uranium, rather than a marine origin resulting from a subsequent rapid transgression. The very restricted range of U/Pb ratios in the lower part of the peat bed, and the heterogeneity of the initial lead isotopic composition in the upper part, preclude U-Pb isochron dating. Po-210 measurements (as a proxy for Pb-210) also indicate possible post-depositional migration of Rn-222 which, if active over a significant period, would bias any U-Pb age estimate. The Th-230/U-238 ages are consistent with deposition during oxygen isotope Stage 9. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Impacts of peat and vegetation on permafrost degradation under climate
   warming
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB [1] Simulations of maximum annual thaw at a continuous and a discontinuous permafrost site in Canada were performed using Community Land Model version 3 (CLM3) and randomized historical climate records from these sites, superimposed with United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 scenario of climate change. A positive trend in permafrost degradation was simulated for the 2000 to 2100 period in response to climate warming. Surface cover condition and soil properties play a dominant role in affecting ground thaw. In particular, a thin peat layer or surface organic cover can significantly buffer the permafrost against severe degradation. The occurrence of vegetation and extensive presence of a peat and organic layer in the circumpolar areas will modulate the regional impact of climate warming on permafrost thaw.

AB High rates of potassium (K) are often applied in an attempt to increase stress tolerance of hybrid bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt Davy] turfs. Two field-grown bermudagrass cultivars,'Tifdwarf' and 'Tifway', were used to determine the influence of applied K on plant nutrient content and nutrient retention in two soils. Six rates of Kranging from 0 to 390 kg . ha(-1) were applied twice per month each growing season from 1992 to 1994. The cultivars were established on both a sand-peat (9:1 by volume) and loamy sand. Potassium chloride and K2SO4 were compared as sources of K, and were applied simultaneously with N applications. Extractable soil K and leaf tissue K concentrations increased with increasing K rates. There was a critical K fertilization level (74 to 84 kg . ha(-1)) for each cultivar and medium combination beyond which no increase in tissue concentration was observed. Increasing K fertilization resulted in a decrease in extractable Ca and Mg in both media with corresponding decreases in tissue Ca and Mg concentrations. High K rates appear to increase the potential for Ca and Mg deficiencies in bermudagrass, indicating that rates higher than those that provide sufficient K levels for normal growth should not be used.

AB Prairie restoration aims to create self-sustaining, resilient prairies that ameliorate biodiversity loss and soil deterioration associated with conversion of native grasslands to agriculture. Legumes are a key component of the nitrogen-limited prairie ecosystem. Evidence suggests that lack of suitable rhizobia may explain legume absence from restored prairies. This study explores effects of novel alternative inoculant delivery methods on: (a) prairie legume establishment, (b) soil biological properties, and (c) inoculant strain ability to nodulate the host over time.
   Alternative inoculation methods for seven legume species were tested in a replicated field experiment. Legume establishment, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and rhizobial inoculant strain recovery were measured over a 3-year period.
   Legume species richness in the second growing season was enhanced by a soil-applied granular clay inoculant, while seed-applied powdered peat inoculation was generally ineffective. When Dalea rhizobia were recovered 3-year after planting, only 2 % from the seed-applied inoculation treatment identified with the inoculant strains, whereas this amount ranged from 53 to 100 % in the other inoculation treatments. Some legumes established unexpectedly effective symbioses with strains not originally intended for them.
   Results provide new insights on inoculation of native legumes, especially when a mix of seeds is involved and the restoration targets harsh environments.

DE WATER STRESS; ROOTING ENVIRONMENT; CLONAL DIFFERENCES; PARTITIONING
AB Two-year-old Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) plants from four clones were grown in naturally lit growth chambers for 6 months at either ambient (350 ppm) or ambient + 250 ppm (600 ppm) CO2 concentration. Plants were grown in large boxes filled with peat, in a system that allowed the roots of individual plants to be harvested easily at the end of the growing season. Half of the boxes were kept well watered and half were allowed to dry out slowly over the summer. Plants growing in elevated CO2 showed a 6.9% increase in mean relative growth rate compared to controls in the drought treatment and a 9.8% increase compared to controls in the well-watered treatment, though there was considerable variation in response among the different clones and water treatments. Rates of net CO2 assimilation were higher and stomatal conductances were lower in plants grown in elevated CO2 than in ambient CO2 in both the well-watered and drought treatments. Both of these factors contributed to the doubling of instantaneous water use efficiency. The partitioning of biomass to roots was unaffected by elevated CO2, but the ratio of needle mass/stems + branches mass decreased. Together with reduced stomatal conductance, this probably caused the observed increases in xylem pressure potentials with elevated CO2.

AB Newly constructed wetlands are created to provide a range of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration. Our understanding of the initial factors leading to successful peat formation in such environments is, however, limited. In a new 100-ha wetland that was created north of Amsterdam (the Netherlands), we conducted an experiment to determine the best combination of abiotic and biotic starting conditions for initial peat-forming processes. Sediment conditions were the main driver of vegetation development, biomass production and elemental composition during the 3-year study period. Overall, helophytes (Typha spp.) dominated basins with nutrient-rich conditions, whereas nutrient-poor basins were covered by submerged vegetation, which produced about seven times less aboveground biomass than helophytes. The C/N ratios for all plant species and biomass components were generally lower under nutrient-rich conditions and were lower for submerged species than helophytes. Because total basin biomass showed five times higher shoot and ten times higher root and rhizome production for clay and organic than sand sediments, even with some differences in decomposition rates are the conditions in the nutrient-rich basins expected to produce higher levels of initial peat formation. The results suggest that addition of a nutrient-rich sediment layer creates the best conditions for initial peat formation by stimulating rapid development of helophytes.

AB Different methods to inoculate seedlings of Pinus pinaster and P. sylvestris with edible Lactarius species under standard greenhouse conditions were evaluated. Fungal inoculations were performed both under pure culture synthesis in vitro, followed by transplantation of acclimatized seedlings, and directly in the greenhouse using different techniques for inocula production (mycelial slurries, vegetative inoculum grown in peat-vermiculite and alginate-entrapped mycelium). In vitro inoculations with L. deliciosus produced thoroughly colonized seedlings. However, a sharp decrease in mycorrhizal colonization was detected on transplanted seedlings after 4 month's growth in the greenhouse. On the other hand, all the inocula applied directly in the greenhouse, except the alginate-entrapped mycelium, produced a variable number of mycorrhizal seedlings and colonization rates after the first growing season, depending on the plant-fungal combination and the inoculation method. Inoculations with vegetative inocula of the strain 178 of L. deliciosus were the most effective in producing mycorrhizal seedlings. All the seedlings inoculated with this strain were colonized although the colonization rates were relatively low. The commercial feasibility of the different inoculation methods for the production of seedlings colonized with edible Lactarius species is discussed.

AB Detrital peat (organic carbon-enriched deposit) with high arsenic (As) content is widely distributed in sediments where groundwater As contamination exists. Iron sulfides often persist in these sediments under anoxic conditions. However, the mechanisms and pathways of formation of iron sulfides and its potential contribution in controlling As mobility are still poorly understood. In this study, we examined three As-contaminated peat sediments from the Hetao Basin in China to gain better understanding of the complex interplay between iron sulfides formation and As mobility. We employed high-resolution spectroscopic techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy and 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy, coupled with electron microscopy to determine the speciation of iron sulfides and the associated As in the peat sediments.
   Pyrite (FeS2) and metastable greigite (Fe3S4) persisted in peat as end-members of S and Fe diagenetic pathways. The Ferich phyllosilicates and decaying plant tissues provided the ideal micro-environments for pyrite and greigite nucleation. Pyrite formation most likely occurred via the polysulfides pathway in the surface water-sediments interface during early diagenetic process, while the relative enrichment of reactive Fe compared to sulfide possibly inhibited the transformation of greigite to pyrite in such Fe-rich sediments.
   Our results revealed that the peat sediments could act as a stable sink for As immobilization under steady groundwater anoxic conditions, with As content up to 250 mg/kg and large proportions (40 to 60 wt.% As) sequestered in pyrite and greigite. Pyrite crystallites had up to 1 wt.% As content through the replacement of the S-I sites. Greigite crystallites had a relatively constant As content ranging from similar to 500 to similar to 1400 mg/kg. Instead of being adsorbed or structurally incorporated, arsenic formed distinct arsenic sulfide phase in the greigite-enriched sediments, which was analogous to realgar. The transfer of As from iron sulfides to ferrihydrite temporarily retarded As release into groundwater under slightly oxic groundwater conditions. However, the reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite and potential subsequent As re-release could be a source of As in groundwater under disturbed redox conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human activities have changed global nitrogen (N) cycling in the last decades. Global warming has potential to alter the decomposition of organic carbon. At the moment the effects of inorganic and organic N additions on litter decomposition, alone and in combination with increasing temperature, are not well known. A filed experiment of N addition (nitrate, ammonium and organic N) was conducted in the reed (Phragmites australis) wetlands in the Yellow River Delta, China. At the end of second growing season, the standing litter (leaf and stem) of reed were collected, and were incubated (90 days) to determine the combined effects of N forms and increasing temperature on litter decomposition. The CO2 production was defined as litter decomposition. The results showed that increasing temperature accelerated stem litter decomposition, and had no effect on leaf litter decomposition. Nitrogen additions inhibited leaf and stem litter decomposition due to the decrease in C/N ratio. Ammonium and organic N additions had larger inhibitory effects on stem litter decomposition compared with nitrate addition. This highlights the importance of differentiating the effects of N forms on litter decomposition. Moreover, the combined effect of N additions and increasing temperature on both litter decomposition was antagonistic due to the decreased Q(10) value of litter decomposition after N additions. Our results suggest that the negative effect of N addition on litter decomposition may be enhanced by increasing temperature in the near future.

AB Channel structure settlement along a canal in Lagos, southwestern Nigeria, was investigated using the ground penetrating radar (GPR) and geotechnical techniques with a view to establishing the cause(s) of the structure failure. GPR probing was carried out along eight parallel traverses in the E-W direction using the GSSI SIR-3000 200 MHz monostatic antenna. Geotechnical investigations involving sieve analysis, Atterberg limits, moisture content, organic content and consolidation test were carried out for soil classification and competence test. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were conducted to determine clay mineralogy of the peaty soil. The GPR data were processed using Radpro software. Four lithological layers consisting the topsoil (sand), peat, clay and sandy clay were delineated from the processed GPR data. Peat occurred at shallow depth to depths deeper than the foundation depth of the engineering structure investigated. The geotechnical results revealed that the peat has 125-167 % moisture content, high liquid limit and plastic index values of 109-174 % and 60-100 % respectively and organic content of 5.12 %. The sieve analysis showed that the peaty soil is fine grained having up to 98 % passing at 0.004 mm sieve opening exhibiting high compressibility and low consolidation coefficients. This peat was classified as organic clay with peat using the unified soil classification system. The XRD analyses showed the dominance of kaolinite, illite and quartz minerals in the peaty soil. This study revealed that the peaty soil underlying the investigated area has geologic and engineering properties not suitable to sustain the canal construction.

AB In this study the effect of summer fertilization on the initiation of frost hardening of containerized second-year Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings is studied. During the second growing season three different fertilization programs (water soluble NPK with micronutrients) determined by electrical conductivity of peat water extract (0.2, 0.5 and 1.2 mS cm(-1)) were initiated. The growth and nutrient concentrations of needles were monitored during the fertilization period. The frost hardiness of seedlings was assessed on four separate occasions at two week intervals from August 7 to September 18. This assessment was based on artificial freezing tests and visual damage scoring of tissue browning on current-year needles. Clear differences in foliar N, P and K concentrations were observed between the fertilization treatments. Fertilization prolonged the growing period of needles and increased root collar diameter. In all the tests, the highest fertilization level resulted in the highest level of frost hardiness. The difference between the fertilization treatments ranged from 1 degrees C to 2.2 degrees C. Frost hardiness increased with an increase in foliar nitrogen concentration and slightly less consistently with increases in foliar phosphorus and potassium concentrations.

AB Four different compression/impression floras are preserved in only 4.32 m to of the geologic section in the Early Permian Shanxi Formation of the Wuda District of Inner Mongolia, northwestern China. These floras represent four different plant communities and landscapes that followed each other in time. The oldest flora was rooted in sandy clay and initiated peat accumulation that lead to the formation of the lower coal seam. This seam is 230-cm thick and overlain by a 66-cm thick volcanic tuff that preserves a second different flora that grew on the peat at the time of the ash-fall. Standing stems and large plant parts are present. The upper part of the tuff is rooted by a single species of lycopsid (the third flora) again initiating peat accumulation. On top of this second seam of 120 cm thickness rests a roof-shale, deposited as mud in a shallow lake, the formation of which was responsible for the cessation of peat deposition. This fourth flora represents the plants growing around the lake on elastic substrate. Four different environments followed each other in this locality over a geologically short time span and each time conditions prevailed to preserve plant macrofossils. Three of these floras represent peat-forming plant communities of essentially the same time interval. This demonstrates the great variability of vegetation and landscapes in the tropical Cathaysian realm of the Late Paleozoic. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper provides details of a study to track the lateral seepage of nitrogen through the bunds of a paddy field in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. Field simulation experiments were conducted during the rice growing season in 2010 at the experimental plots of the Sanjiang Mire Wetland Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Measurements revealed that the lateral seepage rates were significantly affected by the irrigation water amount. Once the lateral seepage began, its rate increased with the increasing water level in the paddy field. The concentrations of nitrogen in lateral seepage from the bund showed good responsiveness to the nitrogen application rates and the fertilization time in the paddy field. The nitrogen concentrations increased with increasing urea application rates, and these concentrations decreased sharply within the first few days (10 similar to 15 d) after fertilization, and then presented a stable trend, suggesting that the first few days (10 similar to 15 d) after fertilization were critical period for pollution control. The bund could intercept some of the nitrogen in seepage water, and it presented higher interception ability to total nitrogen (N-t) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) than that of nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N). For the three urea treatments, the seasonal N-t output loads were estimated to be 7.82, 26.49 and 33.35 kg ha(-1), respectively, taking about 8.69, 14.72 and 12.35 percent of the total nitrogen fertilizer applied. The lateral seepage contributed to more than 35 percent of the nitrogen loss load, and it is one of the most important pathways for nitrogen loss from paddy field.

AB Mineralogy and geochemistry of No.6 Coal from the Heidaigou Mine of the Jungar Coalfield of North China were studied using instrumental neutron activation analysis, inductively coupled-plasma mass spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The results show that gallium concentration is as high as 44.8 mu g center dot g(-1) in the whole coal-Channel sample, and varies from 30.1 mu g center dot g(-1) to 76.0 mu g center dot g(-1) (mean 51.9 mu g center dot g(-1)) in the main minable benches of No.6 Coal. Such high concentration of Ga in the coal is far higher than the industrial grade (30 mu g center dot g(-1)). The thickness of the main minable benches accounts for 81.9% of the whole coal bed. The laboratory high-temperature ashes (550 degrees C) of the main minable coal benches also contain a high concentration of Ga, varying from 62.2 mu g center dot g(-1) to 178 mu g center dot g(-1), with an average of 89.2 mu g center dot g(-1). The boehmite significantly enriched in No.6 Coal is the main carrier of the high Ga in the coal. Average concentration of Ga in boehmite is 0.09%. The average content of boehmite is 6.1% in the whole coal and 7.5% in the main minable benches. Boehmite is derived from the bauxite in the weathered crust of the underlying Benxi Formation in the north of the basin during the peat accumulation. The colloidal idrargillite had been shortly transported from the weathered crust to the peat mire, and owing to the compaction of the overlying strata during the peat accumulation and early diagenesis, the idrargillite colloid had begun to be dehydrated, leading to boehmite formation. A preliminary estimation showed that the ensured and prospected reserves of Ga in No.6 Coal are up to 6.3 x 10(4)t and 8.57x10(5)t, indicating a superlarge gallium ore deposit. The particular paleogeography of the Jungar Coalfield and the peculiar carrier of Ga in coal suggest that this Ga ore deposit is unique in the world. Rare earth elements are also enriched in coal and laboratory ashes. The weighted average concentration of the total rare earth elements is 255 mu g center dot g(-1) and 830.36 mu g center dot g(-1) in the main minable benches and their laboratory ashes, respectively. Because Al is the main composition of boehmite, aluminum and rare earth elements in No.6 Coal are also the available and valuable resources.

AB Core and seismic data from the Venice lagoon area, located in the foreland region between the northern Apennines and the southern Alps (northern Italy), allow a detailed investigation of the Late Pleistocene fully continental succession accumulated during the last glacial phase. These deposits consist of an aggrading alluvial plain, some tens of meters thick, which is locally incised by river channels, while both patchy and continuous peat layers complete the succession. In particular, a very continuous peat layer up to 1 m thick (P1), sandwiched within alluvial plain sediments, is well recognizable in the whole lagoon area in both cores and seismic lines. C-14 datings of P1 reveal an age ranging between 22 and 24 cal ka B.P., confirming its lateral continuity. All these elements suggest that P1 developed after an episode of marked moisture and large scale cut-off of terrigenous sediment, leading to the establishment of generalized paludal conditions probably during the Laugerie interstadial. As at these latitudes interstadial phases were commonly typified by enhanced arboreal vegetation cover preventing significant terrigenous supply, swamp areas characterized by peat accumulation developed. The present evidence is helpful to recognize stadial-interstadial cycles during the last glacial phase, and may integrate the current knowledge to establish a correlation between cycles recorded in fully continental deposits and those recognizable in ice cores and marine successions.

AB The persistence and penetration into soil of surface-applied unformulated conidia of two isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae and one of Beauveria bassiana at sites with clay, peat and two kinds of sand as their soil types and at depths of from 0 to 20 cm was studied in 1988-1991 under conditions characterized by permanent snow cover and frozen soil in the winter time. At 0-5 cm depth, M. anisopliae persisted throughout the experiment at all sites, clay being the most and peat the least favourable soil for persistence. Clay and one of the sandy soils were the least and peat the most conducive soil to penetration of M. anisopliae from the surface to deeper soil layers and persistence therein. Differences in persistence were evident between the two M. anisopliae isolates in the sandy and peat sites, but not in the clay site. Three years post-application there were still enough infectious propagules of M. anisopliae in soil of all sites to infect over 80% of the Tenebrio molitor larvae used as baits in samples taken from the cylinders of all soils. All the augmented propagules of B. bassiana disappeared during the first winter after application in clay and one of the two sandy sites, but some persistence one year post-inoculation was evident at 0-5 depth in one of the sand soils and at 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths in peat.

AB On-farm biopurification systems were developed to remove pesticides from contaminated water generated at the farmyard. An important process in the system's efficiency is the sorption of pesticides to the substrates used in the biopurification systems. The composition and type of material present in the biobed are crucial for retention of chemicals. This study investigated the sorption of linuron, isoproturon, metalaxyl, isoxaben, bentazon and lenacil on substrates commonly used in a biopurification system, i.e. cow manure, straw, willow chopping, soil, coconut chips, garden waste compost, and peat mix. Linear, Freundlich. and Langmuir sorption isotherms were fitted to the obtained data. The best fit was obtained with the Freundlich model. More immobile pesticides (i.e. linuron and isoxaben) tended to associate with the organic substrate, while more mobile pesticides partition in the water (i.e. bentazon). According to sorption capacity, the substrates could be classified as peat mix > compost, coco chips, straw > cow manure, willow chopping > sandy loam soil. Sorption capacity was positively correlated with the organic carbon content, CaO and the cation exchange capacity. Furthermore, no significant differences in sorption could be found between technical and formulated isoproturon and bentazon, Moreover, the individual sorption coefficient K-d was additive, which means that individual sorption coefficients can be used to calculate the sorption coefficients of a mixture of substrates. What concerns the mutual interaction of pesticides it could be observed that the sorption of linuron and metalaxyl was significantly lower in combination with isoproturon and bentazon, while the latter pesticides were not influenced by the presence of linuron and metalaxyl. As guidelines, firstly, it could be stated that using the most sorbing materials such as peat mix, might significantly increase the biopurification systems efficiency. Secondly, the treatment of very mobile pesticides, such as bentazon, should be taken with care as these will easily leach through the system. Additional chemical treatment might be necessary for these type of pesticides. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rooting depth, watertable depth and oxygen regime were measured in plots of Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine and a 50% mixture of each species planted on a deep unflushed blanket peat.  The water-table was about 10 cm deeper and roots occurred about 2 cm deeper under the pine than under the spruce or the mixture.  In addition the mean concentration of oxygen at 50 cm depth was significantly larger under the pine and the mixture than under the spruce, showing that the rapid early growth of the pine had started to dry the peat.  There was no evidence of any improvement in the growth of the spruce in the mixture compared to the pure Sitka spruce, suggesting that the expected nursing benefit had not occurred.

AB The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of different fertigation treatments (25, 50, 75 and 100 %) on yield and nutrient uptake of watermelon as the second crop and to compare with conventional practices. Experiments were conducted over the experimental fields of Eukurova University, Agricultural Faculty Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department under field conditions. Experiment was conducted in randomized blocks split plots design with three replications. A total of 160 kg ha(-1) nitrogen (N) as ammonium sulphate, 100 kg ha(-1) phosphorus (P) as MKP and 200 kg ha(-1) potassium (K) as KNO3 were applied. Seedlings were planted in peat/perlite mixture (1:1 V/V) and transplanted to experimental plots following with wheat harvest in June. The watermelon plants were irrigated 9 times during the growing season in one week intervals. Current findings revealed that 75% fertigation treatment (120 kg ha(-1) N, 75 kg ha(-1) P, 150 kg ha(-1) K) had the greatest yield (48.38 t ha(-1)). Also, it increased N (% 3.78), P (% 0.31), Zn (45.7 mg kg(-1)), Mn (43.1 mg kg(-1)) and Cu (17.6 mg kg(-1)) contents of plants.

AB Albian coal measures of the Skeena Group in the Telkwa coalfield comprise more than 500 m of conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and coal that were deposited during two regressive/transgressive cycles. The stratigraphic sequence is divisible into four lithostratigraphic units. The basal unit (Unit 1) is about 100 m thick and comprises conglomerate, sandstone, mudstone, coal and seatearth deposited in a fluvial environment on a deeply eroded volcanic basement. Gravel and sand were deposited in braided channels and bars, and mud accumulated in floodplains. Feat accumulated in poorly drained backswamps. In the northern part of the study area, coal seams thin and split, a result of periodic flooding of peat swamps with sediment-laden water from nearby streams. Deposition of Unit I ended with marine transgression. Unit II consists of up to 140 m of silty mudstone, bioturbated and cross-bedded, chert and muscovite-rich sandstone, and rare thin carbonaceous mudstones deposited in a shallow marine environment. The sands were deposited as distributary channels and mouth-bars. Muds were deposited in bays and thin discontinuous peat accumulated in local salt marshes.
   Unit III averages 90 m in thickness and comprises bioturbated and rippled, chert and muscovite-rich sandstone, siltstone, carbonaceous mudstone and thick coal seams deposited in a variety of low-energy, paralic environments. Sand and mud were deposited and biogenically reworked in tidal flats, and siltstone accumulated in a restricted, nearshore marine environment to the east. Feat accumulated in freshwater coastal, domed mires which periodically prograded over tidal flats. All but the lowermost coal seams pinch out eastward into brackish and nearshore marine sediments. The ash yield of many coals increases towards their seaward margin. Locally, the sulphur yield of the coal is high, reflecting occasional inundation by brackish water. The coals were deposited during regressive maximum and are characterized by an essentially vertical stacking pattern comprising an aggradational parasequence set. The major coals are considered to have been deposited at the turnaround between progradation and retrogradation.
   Unit IV is over 150 m thick and is composed of chloritic sandstone overlain by silty mudstone, deposited in a marine environment. The basal sandstone is a transgressive lag deposit. Silty mudstone is the predominant lithofacies and was deposited in a nearshore, shallow marine environment. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Following large-scale surface oil sands mining, large tracts of the boreal forest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region of Western Canada are legally required to be reclaimed. A greater understanding of how these novel ecosystems function and develop with regard to water use is crucial to aid in the development of regulatory practices and protocols based on information from ecosystem recovery. In this paper, a 12-year (2003-2014) eddy covariance measurement record of latent and sensible heat fluxes and gross ecosystem productivity of carbon dioxide is analysed to evaluate how a reclaimed boreal forest has developed during its initial growth period. The study site is a reclaimed oil sands saline-sodic clay shale overburden deposit that was topped with 100cm of glacial till and 20cm of peat mineral mix. The site was seeded with barley (Hordeum spp.) in 2001 to reduce erosion of the soil cover whereas aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) boreal tree species were planted in 2004. Changes in structure and function corresponded to the transition of dominant vegetation cover from early successional species to forest. Leaf area index increased from a growing season peak of 0.9 in 2003 to 4.0 in 2014 and was associated with an increased growing season gross ecosystem productivity (4.9 to 8.9g C m(-2) day(-1)), an increased evapotranspiration (1.6 to 3.4mm day(-1)), and a decreased partitioning of energy to sensible heat (Bowen's ratio decreased from 1.1 to 0.4). Although canopy conductance increased throughout the 12years, the shift from early successional species to trees with more conservative water use resulted in a decrease in conductance normalized by leaf area. Water use efficiency has increased slightly since 2008 with an average of 10.0g CO2 kg(-1) H2O for the last 6 years. No prolonged dry periods were observed during the study period. The functioning of this novel ecosystem is evolving as expected on the basis of the trends observed for other natural and disturbed boreal forests.

AB Tussocks formed by Carex stricta are a relatively large carbon (C) pool in sedge meadows, but the stability of organic matter in these ecosystems is not well understood. We initiated year-long incubation experiments (22.5 degrees C) to evaluate the CO2 and CH4 production potentials of sedge meadow substrates under field moist and inundated treatments from five sites in the Upper Midwest, USA (4 reference, I restored). C mineralization potentials decreased with depth (tussocks > underlying soil), and were positively correlated with macro-organic matter content and negatively with lignin. Across sites, C stored in tussocks and soil at the restoration was the least stable, suggesting that the restoration of C-storage function may take decades. Mineralization potentials were similar between field moist and inundated treatments, but inundation resulted in higher methane production, accounting for 24-51% of total carbon mineralized from tussocks. In the field however, C stricta tussocks emitted less methane (393 +/- 76 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) than tussock interspaces (1362 +/- 371 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) early in the growing season; we suggest that tussock tops oxidized methane produced from deeper anoxic horizons. Our results highlight the importance of considering how microtopography modulates greenhouse gas flux from wetlands and suggests that the C stored in the older, more decomposed C stricta tussock sedge meadow substrates (both within and between sites) is relatively stable.

ID APERTURE RADAR DATA; MULTIFREQUENCY; PARAMETERS
AB Mapping forest cover types in the boreal ecosystem is important for understanding the processes governing the interaction of the surface with the atmosphere. In this paper we report the results of the land-cover classification of the SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data acquired during the Boreal Ecosystem Atmospheric Study's intensive field campaigns over the southern study area near Prince Albert, Canada. A Bayesian maximum a posteriori classifier was applied on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory airborne SAR images covering the region during the peak of the growing season in July 1994. The approach is supervised in the sense that a combination of field data and existing land-cover maps are used to develop training areas for the desired classes. The images acquired were first radiometrically and absolutely calibrated the incidence angle effect in airborne images was corrected to art acceptable accuracy, and the images were used in a mosaic form and geocoded and georeferenced with an existing land-cover map for validation purposes. The results shore that SAR images can be classified into dominant forest types such as jack pine, black spruce, trembling aspen, clearing, open. water and three categories of mired strands with better than 90% accuracy. The unispecies stands such as jack pine and black spruce are separated with 98% accuracy, but the accuracy of mixed coniferous and deciduous stands suffers from confusing factors such as varying species composition, surface moisture, and understory effects. To satisfy the requirements of process models, the number of cover types was reduced from eight to five general classes of conifer wet, conifer dry, mixed deciduous, disturbed, and open water. Reduction of classes improved the overall accuracy of the classification over the entire region from 77% to 92%. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Horizontal heterogeneity causes difficulties in the eddy covariance technique for measuring surface fluxes, related to both advection and the confounding of temporal and spatial variability. Our aim here was to address this problem, using statistical modelling and footprint analysis, applied to a case study of fluxes of sensible heat and methane in a subarctic mire. We applied a new method to infer the spatial heterogeneity in fluxes of sensible heat and methane from a subarctic ecosystem in northern Sweden, where there were clear differences in surface types within the landscape. We inferred the flux from each of these surface types, using a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters of a hierarchical model which includes coefficients for the different surface types. The approach is based on the variation in the flux observed at a single eddy covariance tower as the footprint changes over time. The method has applications wherever spatial heterogeneity is a concern in the interpretation of eddy covariance fluxes.

AB This study aims to evaluate three classes of methods to discriminate between 13 peatland vegetation types using reflectance data. These vegetation types were empirically defined according to their composition, strata and biodiversity richness. On one hand, it is assumed that the same vegetation type spectral signatures have similarities. Consequently, they can be compared to a reference spectral database. To catch those similarities, several similarities criteria (related to distances (Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Canberra distance) or spectral shapes (Spectral Angle Mapper) or probabilistic behaviour (Spectral Information Divergence)) and several mathematical transformations of spectral signatures enhancing absorption features (such as the first derivative or the second derivative, the normalized spectral signature, the continuum removal, the continuum removal derivative reflectance, the log transformation) were investigated. Furthermore, those similarity measures were applied on spectral ranges which characterize specific biophysical properties. On the other hand, we suppose that specific biophysical properties/components may help to discriminate between vegetation types applying supervised classification such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Regularized Logistic Regression (RLR), Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Biophysical components can be used in a local way considering vegetation spectral indices or in a global way considering spectral ranges and transformed spectral signatures, as explained above. RLR classifier applied on spectral vegetation indices (training size = 25%) was able to achieve 77.21% overall accuracy in discriminating peatland vegetation types. It was also able to discriminate between 83.95% vegetation types considering specific spectral range [350-1350 nm], first derivative of spectral signatures and training size = 25%. Conversely, similarity criterion was able to achieve 81.70% overall accuracy using the Canberra distance computed on the full spectral range [350-2500 nm]. The results of this study suggest that RLR classifier and similarity criteria are promising to map the different vegetation types with high ecological values despite vegetation heterogeneity and mixture.

AB This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest of native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occuring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock. water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil.

AB Black spruce [ Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] and tamarack [ Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch] are the predominant tree species in boreal peatlands. The effects of 34 days of flooding on morphological and physiological responses were investigated in the greenhouse for black spruce and tamarack seedlings in their second growing season (18 months old). Flooding resulted in reduced root hydraulic conductance, net assimilation rate and stomatal conductance and increased needle electrolyte leakage in both species. Flooded tamarack seedlings maintained a higher net assimilation rate and stomatal conductance compared to flooded black spruce. Flooded tamarack seedlings were also able to maintain higher root hydraulic conductance compared to flooded black spruce seedlings at a comparable time period of flooding. Root respiration declined in both species under flooding. Sugar concentration increased in shoots while decreasing in roots in both species under flooding. Needles of flooded black spruce appeared necrotic and electrolyte leakage increased over time with flooding and remained significantly higher than in flooded tamarack seedlings. No visible damage symptoms were observed in flooded tamarack seedlings. Flooded tamarack seedlings developed adventitious roots beginning 16 days after the start of flooding treatment. Adventitious roots exhibited significantly higher root hydraulic conductivity than similarly sized flooded tamarack roots. Flooded black spruce lacked any such morphological adaptation. These results suggest that tamarack is better able to adjust both morphologically and physiologically to prolonged soil flooding than black spruce seedlings.

AB Surface waters in the Florida Everglades contain high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compounds. delta(13)C values of DOC samples collected from the northern Everglades indicate that less than about 23% of the DOC was derived from sugarcane (the dominant agricultural crop in the area), and the amount of DOC from sugarcane was greater during the dry period. Most of the DOC (>50%) in the northern Everglades was in the low molecular weight (< 1000 Dalton) fraction (LMW-DOC). The relative amount of high molecular weight DOC (HMW-DOC) was higher in the wet period than in the dry period. Radiocarbon ages of the DOC ranged from "> modern" to about 2400 years B.P., indicating that DOC was derived from both historic peat deposits and modern vegetation. At each site, the HMW-DOC had older radiocarbon ages than the LMW-DOC, and therefore contained a greater fraction of DOC derived from the historic peat deposits. It appears that at least some of the old DOC compounds from the historic peat deposits were decomposed during their residence in the surface water system in the northern Everglades, and the LMW-DOC was more microbially labile than the HMW-DOC. Our analysis suggests that accelerated decomposition of organic matter in the historic peat deposits (due to land-use change) could be a significant source of DOC and nutrients in the northern Everglades. Our data also suggest that the radiocarbon signature of DOC could be used as a sensitive indicator of the overall effectiveness of a wetland restoration project.

AB The palsas of Leirpullan are developed in deltaic sands and silts in the zone of alpine permafrost at an altitude of 1437 m (estimated mean annual air temperature -2.7 degrees C). Five mounds that represent a chronosequence are analysed with particular reference to initiation, aggradation and degradation phases. It is inferred that geoecological factors control initial mound formation beneath areas of thin (<20 cm) moss-peat, which provide summer insulation for developing permafrost. Low summer temperatures and low summer precipitation appear to allow the survival of permafrost, the existence of stable mounds, and limited height growth, after the gradual successional replacement of moss-peat by fellfield vegetation growing directly on the mineral substrate. Degradation occurs owing to thermokarstic processes, which result in the formation of rim-ridge ramparts. 'Exogenous' processes associated with lateral thermal erosion by lake and river water are important at the site. Regeneration and the possible effects of climatic change are also discussed. Palsas with only a thin peat cover in the initial stage of formation but no peat cover during subsequent development and degradation are considered to be near one extreme of a morphological and genetic continuum of pure peat palsas to mineral permafrost mounds. The rim-ridge ramparts characteristic of the degraded palsas of Leirpullan appear to provide appropriate modern analogues for relict Pleistocene forms in Wales and elsewhere in Europe formerly interpreted as pingo scars.

AB Purpose Implementation of green roofs could help to reduce rapid runoff and help cities to mitigate heat islands. The aim of the study is to assess the water and temperature regimes of four experimental green roof test beds having different growing media and plant coverage during the vegetation season 2018. Materials and methods Experiments were conducted in four test beds (1 x 1 m) established on a flat roof. Two types of growing media were used. The first (A) was a substrate composed of crushed spongolite, crushed expanded clay, and peat. The second (B) was a coarser substrate, composed of crushed expanded clay, crushed bricks, peat, and compost. Two test beds, hereafter designated ACu and BCu, were filled with substrates A and B respectively and planted with a mixture ofSedumspp. cuttings with approximately 10% coverage. The substrate thickness was 6 cm. Two other test beds, designated ACa and BCa, were filled to a depth of 4 cm with A and B growing media, respectively, and planted with a carpet ofSedumspp. with approximate coverage of 100%. Results and discussion The experiment was conducted over one growing season. Continuous monitoring of substrate temperature, water content, and outflow was conducted on each test bed. The lowest runoff coefficient was observed in test bed ACu, while the highest runoff occurred in test bed BCu, with twice the amount of outflow as ACu. The total runoff coefficient of ACa was more than one-third higher than that of ACu. The lowest maximum substrate temperature on the hottest day of the season was observed in bed ACa with a temperature of 40.6 degrees C, while the highest temperature was seen in bed BCu, 7.9 degrees C higher. Conclusions The analysis of the rainfall-runoff relationship calculated for individual rainfall events demonstrated that runoff coefficients depended on initial water content, rainfall intensity, rainfall depth, substrate type, and vegetation cover. Beds planted with sedum carpets and having more extensive vegetation coverage were superior at moderating extremes of temperature.

AB The use of biochar as an additive for growing media for the production of potted plants requires a sound knowledge of how its properties impact plant biomass production. This study aims at linking physical and chemical properties of biochar with horticultural crop biomass. For this purpose, we incorporated six different biochars into growing medium and grew basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), lettuce (Lactuca saliva L. var. crispa) and pansy (Viola wittrockiana Gams.) for one month in greenhouse conditions. We found that physical and chemical properties of biochars had a significant impact on plant growth. Biochars with low density and high porosity promoted the biomass of basil and lettuce. While nutrient concentration in biochars had no impact on plant growth, lettuce and pansy biomasses decreased with increasing biochar pH and basil biomass decreased with increasing biochar electrical conductivity. By identifying which biochar properties influence plant biomass, our study allows selection of the biochars which are the best suited for incorporation into growing media.

ID SIMULATION-MODEL; HYDROLOGY; PEATLANDS; ORIGIN
AB Wetland ecosystems are often characterized by distinct vegetation patterns. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of these patterns; including spatially variable peat accumulation and water ponding. Recently, short-range facilitation and long-range competition for resources (a.k.a scale dependent feedback) has been proposed as a possible mechanism for pattern formation in wetland ecosystems. We modify an existing, spatially explicit, advection-reaction-diffusion model to include for a regional hydraulic gradient and effective anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity. This effective anisotropic hydraulic conductivity implicitly represents the effect of ponding: a reduction in the long-range inhibition of vegetation growth in the direction perpendicular to the prevailing hydraulic gradient. We demonstrate that by accounting for effective anisotropy in a simple modeling framework that encompasses only a scale dependent feedback between biomass and nutrient flow, we can reproduce the various vegetation patterns observed in wetland ecosystems: maze, and vegetation bands both perpendicular and parallel to prevailing flow directions. We examine the behavior of this model over a range of plant transpiration rates and regional hydraulic gradients. Results show that by accounting for the effective x-y anisotropy that results from biomass-water interaction (i.e., ponding) we can better understand the mechanisms that drive ecosystem patterning.

AB Holocene permafrost from ice wedge polygons in the vicinity of large seabird breeding colonies in the Thule District, NW Greenland, was drilled to explore the relation between permafrost aggradation and seabird presence. The latter is reliant on the presence of the North Water Polynya (NOW) in the northern Baffin Bay. The onset of peat accumulation associated with the arrival of little auks (Alle alle) in a breeding colony at Annikitisoq, north of Cape York, is radiocarbon-dated to 4400 cal BP. A thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia) colony on Appat (Saunders Island) in the mouth of the Wolstenholme Fjord started 5650 cal BP. Both species provide marine-derived nutrients (MDNs) that fertilize vegetation and promote peat growth. The geochemical signature of organic matter left by the birds is traceable in the frozen Holocene peat. The peat accumulation rates at both sites are highest after the onset, decrease over time, and were about 2-times faster at the little auk site than at the thick-billed murre site. High accumulation rates induce shorter periods of organic matter (OM) decomposition before it enters the perennially frozen state. This is seen in comparably high C/N ratios and less depleted delta C-13, pointing to a lower degree of OM decomposition at the little auk site, while the opposite pattern can be discerned at the thick-billed murre site. Peat accumulation rates correspond to delta N-15 trends, where decreasing accumulation led to increasing depletion in delta N-15 as seen in the little-auk-related data. In contrast, the more decomposed OM of the thick-billed murre site shows almost stable delta N-15. Late Holocene wedge ice fed by cold season precipitation was studied at the little auk site and provides the first stable-water isotopic record from Greenland with mean delta O-18 of -180 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand, mean delta D of -136.2 +/- 5.7 parts per thousand, mean d excess of 7.7 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand, and a delta O-18-delta D slope of 7.27, which is close to those of the modern Thule meteoric water line. The syngenetic ice wedge polygon development is mirrored in testacean records of the little auk site and delineates polygon low-center, dry-out, and polygon-high-center stages. The syngenetic permafrost formation directly depending on peat growth (controlled by bird activity) falls within the period of neoglacial cooling and the establishment of the NOW, thus indirectly following the Holocene climate trends.

AB Atmospheric N deposition can enhance biological P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems and increase the importance of organic P to plants and microorganisms. We used NaOH-EDTA extraction and solution P-31 NMR spectroscopy to determine the P composition of soils in the Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve, northern England, an upland region influenced by such deposition for at least 150 years. Three characteristic soil types were sampled on three occasions during an annual cycle: blanket peat (318 mg g(-1) total C, 607 mug g(-1) total P, pH 3.9); acid organic soil under grassland (354 mg g(-1) total C, 1190 mug g(-1) total P, pH 3.7); calcareous soil under grassland (140 mg g(-1) total C, 649 mug g(-1) total P, pH 7.3). Between 58 and 99% of the total P in soil and litter layers was extracted by 0.25 M NaOH + 0.05 M EDTA. Extracts of all soils were dominated by organic P, mainly in the form of orthophosphate monoesters (43-69% extracted P). The two acidic soils also contained large proportions of orthophosphate diesters (6-19% extracted P) and phosphonates (7-16% extracted P), suggesting that these compounds become stabilised at low pH. However, a seasonal trend of increasing orthophosphate monoester-to-diester ratios, most evident in the calcareous grassland soil, indicated the preferential degradation of orthophosphate diesters during the growing season. Orthophosphate was the major inorganic P compound (17-34% extracted P), and all soils contained pyrophosphate (1-5% extracted P). However, orthophosphate determined in the NaOH-EDTA extracts by solution P-31 NMR spectroscopy was substantially greater than that determined by molybdate colourimetry, suggesting that orthophosphate occurred in complexes with humic compounds that were not detected by conventional procedures. Our results suggest that organisms able to use recalcitrant soil organic P may have a competitive advantage in environments under enhanced atmospheric N deposition.

AB Stratigraphic records from coastal cliff sections near the Marresale Station on the Yamal Peninsula, Russia, yield new insight on ice-sheet dynamics and paleoenvironments; for northern Eurasia. Field studies identify nine informal stratigraphic units from oldest to youngest (the Marresale formation, Labsuyakha sand, Kara diamicton, Varjakha peat and silt, Oleny sand, Baidarata sand, Betula horizon, Nenets peat, and Chum sand) that show a single glaciation and a varied terrestrial environment during the late Pleistocene. The Kara diamicton reflects regional glaciation and is associated with glaciotectonic deformation from the southwest of the underlying Labsuyakha sand and Marresale formation. Finite radiocarbon and luminescence ages of ca. 35,000 to 45,000 yr from Varjakha peat and silt that immediately overlies Kara diamicton place the glaciation >40,000 yr ago. Eolian and fluvial deposition ensued with concomitant cryogenesis between ca. 35,000 and 12,000 cal yr B.P. associated with the Oleny and the Baidarata sands. There is no geomorphic or stratigraphic evidence of coverage or proximity of the Yamal Peninsula to a Late Weichselian ice sheet. The Nenets peat accumulated over the Baidarata sand during much of the past 10,000 yr, with local additions of the eolian Chum sand starting ca. 1000 yr ago. A prominent Betula horizon at the base of the Nenets peat contains rooted birch trees ca. 10,000 to 9000 cal yr old and indicates a >200-km shift northward of the treeline from the present limits, corresponding to a 2degrees to 4degreesC summer warming across northern Eurasia.

AB Different combinations of peat and chalk or lime sources with differing moisture contents were used to determine how specific physical and chemical properties of the casing soil relate to the growth and water relations of the mushroom. The peat types varied in terms of decomposition and extraction method; the lime addition varied in terms of rate and type (chalk or sugar beet lime). During the colonisation of the casing soil before fruiting, the extension growth rate of mushroom mycelium was most closely correlated (negatively) with the volumetric moisture content of the casing soil. Scanning electron microscopy showed that mycelium growing at a lower casing soil matric potential (Psi(m)) had a much finer and branched structure than mycelium growing at a higher Psi(m). Across all the peat and lime source treatments, a relationship was found between the mean Psi(m) of the casing soil and mushroom yield, with an optimum Psi(m) of -7.9 to -9.4 kPa. Mushrooms are produced in 'flushes' at about 8-day intervals and during the development of each flush of mushrooms, there was a significant decrease in casing soil Psi(m). This decrease (to below -40 kPa) was greatest in the second flush, which was the highest yielding. There were no relationships between mushroom yield and casing soil osmotic potential Psi(pi) within the range -93 to -154 kPa or any of the other chemical properties and water and air holding characteristics of the casing soils which were determined. Across different casing soil treatments, mushroom dry matter content was negatively correlated with mushroom yield and positively correlated with mushroom tissue osmotic potential.

ID TRACE-ELEMENTS; KAROO BASIN; LIGNITES; MINE
AB Sedimentological investigations of the coal-bearing Vryheid Formation (Karoo Sequence) in the Witbank Coalfield have revealed that coal-peat deposition was associated with both marine and non-marine palaeodepositional events.  At the terminal stage of peat accumulation, swamps were inundated by marine transgressions which deposited mud and silt above the peat (coal) and these over-lying sediments contain typical marine features:  glauconite associated with marine ichnofossil assemblages.  In similar stratigraphic positions elsewhere in the basin, the peat swamps were invaded by basinward-prograding non-marine fluvial systems which deposited coarse sand and gravel over the peat.  These overlying sediments are coarse-grained arkosic strata.
   Geochemical analysis of the No. 2, No. 4 and No. 5 coal seams in the region were undertaken using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRFS).  These analyses show that the geochemistry of the coal compliments the sedimentological interpretations.  Elements which tend to be more concentrated in marine-derived sediments, e.g. boron, chlorine, lithium and bromine, occur in greater concentrations in the top of coals overlain by marine strata than in coals overlain by non-marine fluvial sequences.  The latter do not show enrichments of these elements.
   Trace-element composition of the coal seams was further utilized as a means of identifying the seams using multivariant discriminant analysis.  Each coal seam plots in a specific field thereby permitting its identification based on the trace-element content.  If unknown areas of the coalfield are being explored, a knowledge of the palaeodepositional stratigraphic sequences together with quantitative geochemical analyses could permit rapid identification of the coals concerned.

AB In this study, peat has been used as an adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals in a fixed bed system. Experiments have been performed to investigate the effect of flowrate and bed depth on the peat-metal ion system. A film-pore diffusion model has been used to predict the breakthrough behaviour. The three major parameters in the mathematical model are the external mass transfer coefficient, k, the effective pore diffusivity, D-eff, and the solid-phase loading capacity, q(e). One of the main problems in this type of modelling is the prediction of q(e), particularly for sorbent-solute systems which take a long time to achieve equilibrium saturation. Some researchers have used the equilibrium isotherm capacity, some utilize a fixed fraction of the isotherm capacity and other workers perform the numerical or graphical mass balances at the breakthrough curves, which is time-consuming and tedious. The present method incorporates a novel empirical solution for q(e), which is correlated with the service time. Good agreement between the predicted theoretical breakthrough curves and the experimental results is observed.

AB Burial of organic matter in deep peat deposits has already been experimentally demostrated to slow down or even inhibit anaerobic decomposition due to lack of diffusive transport and end-product accumulation. However, so far little is known about potential biogeochemical or thermodynamic indicators for the observed inhibition of further decomposition. For example, theoretical energy yields for methanogenesis, hydrogen partial pressures, stable isotope fractionation factors between CO2 and CH4, and electrochemical properties of dissolved organic matter have been proposed as thermodyamic indicators for such inhibition. To test the applicability and explanatory power of these indicators to identify conditions inhibiting organic matter decomposition, we incubated homogenized ombrotrophic peat for 300 days at 20 degrees C under diffusive flux conditions as control, and compared the observed effects to a treatment with vertical advective transport by water circulation and to a treatment in which both the unsaturated and water-saturated zone of the peat profile were kept anoxic. Results of energy yields of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were compared to hydrogen partial pressures, to C-13 isotope fractionation factors and to redox properties of dissolved organic matter as obtained from mediated electrochemical oxidation and reduction. While CO2 and CH4 production slowed substantially in the deep peat profile, a concomitant decrease of Gibs free energy yields available to hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogensis and hydrogen and acetate concentrations over time supported a thermodynamic constraint on methanogenesis. Although, energy yields for the hydrogenotrophic pathway were close to or below the theoretical energy minimum levels already after 15 days. Transiently elevated H-2 concentrations, not related to actual methanogenesis rates were observed for about 150-225 days. Thereafter, hydrogen concentrations diminished to levels below thresholds to thermodynamically support ongoing methanogenesis. Thus even on incubation timescales of 150-225 days, steady-state hydrogen concentrations as would be expected from thermodynamic considerations did not adjust on the bulk scale of observation. Gibbs free energy estimates for methanogenesis based on hydrogen partial pressures were consequently biased and did not reach the minimum required threshold despite ovious net CH4 production. Ratios between electron accepting (EAC) and donating (EDC) capacity of dissolved organic matter, however, turned out to provide suitable indicators of predominant redox conditions along gradients, stabilizing at low values upon onset of methanogenesis. Thus, our study demonstrated that the thermodynamically driven slow down of decomposition in deep peat deposits, preventing the peat to decompose further, cannot be easily identified based on a single indicator. However, constant and high concentrations of decomposition end-products, indicating zero net turnover and low energy yields, and constantly low EAC/EDC ratios, indicating no further availability of terminal electron acceptors, seem to be characteristic of the onset of conditions inhibiting further significant decomposition of peat.

AB Recent rates of peat accretion (as determined by Cs-137) and N, P, organic C, Ca and Na accumulation were measured along a 10 km eutrophication gradient in the northern Everglades area of Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA 2A) that has received agricultural drainage from the Hillsboro canal for the past 25-30 yrs. Rates of peat accretion were highest at sampling locations closest to the Hillsboro canal, 1.6 km downstream, (5.67 +/- 0.50 mm/yr) and decreased to 2.01 +/- 0.31 mm/yr at distances of 7.1 to 10.7 km downstream. Phosphorus and Na accumulation were a function of both peat accretion and soil P and Na concentrations. The concentration and accumulation of P in peat deposited in the past 26 years was highest near the Hillsboro canal (1478 +/- 67 mug/g, 0.66 +/- 0.06 g/m2/yr) and decreased to 560 +/- 20 mug/g and 0.10 +/- 0.02 g/M2/yr at distances of 8.8 to 10.7 km downstream. Like phosphorus, the concentration and rate of Na accumulation was highest near the Hillsboro canal (3205 +/- 1021 mug/g, 1.48 +/- 0.53 g/m2/yr). Although sodium enrichment of the peat was limited to 1.6 km downstream of the Hillsboro canal, increased rates of Na accumulation penetrated 5.2 km downstream of the Hillsboro canal, the extent of the area of enhanced peat accretion.
   In contrast to P and Na, there was no difference in the concentration of soil organic C, N and Ca along the eutrophication gradient. However, there was a gradient of organic C, N and Ca accumulation corresponding to the area of enhanced peat accretion. The highest rates occurred 1.6 km south of the Hillsboro canal (212 +/- 5 g organic C/M2/yr, 14.1 +/- 0.4 g N/m2/yr, 22.1 +/- 5.2 g Ca/m2/yr). Accumulation of organic C, N and Ca at distances of 7.1-10.7 km downstream averaged 87 +/- 11, 6.3 +/- 0.7 and 6.5 +/- 0.9 g/m2/yr, respectively.
   The areal extent of enhanced peat accretion and organic C, N, Ca and Na accumulation encompasses approximately 7700 ha of the northern part of WCA 2A. The area of enhanced P accumulation is larger, covering 11,500 ha or 26% of the total area of WCA 2A. The 11,500 ha area has functioned as a sink for P for the past 25-30 yr removing 74% (49.3 MT/yr) of the 67 MT/yr that enters via agricultural drainage and rainfall: Moreover, P accumulation along the gradient was related to mean (1989-1990) surface water P concentration, decreasing as surface water P decreases. These findings suggest that P accumulation is dependent on the P concentration in the water column and that decreasing P loadings per unit area result in less P storage per unit area. The potential long-term equilibrium of the 11,500 ha area as a sink for P is based on a mean annual loading of 67 metric tons P/yr. Input rates exceeding this loading rate could result in an expansion of the 11,500 ha area until a new equilibrium size is reached.

AB The results of a long-term study of changes in soils and vegetation during postagrogenic succession of sown meadows on reclaimed peat soils (Eutric Histosols) are presented. The study was performed on experimental plots in the Korzinskaya Lowland (Karelia); sowing of perennial grasses was accompanied by the application of mineral fertilizers. Observations over changes in the vegetation communities along with the reduction of the peat thickness were conducted. The soil samples were analyzed for the organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus contents and for the pH of salt extracts. Vegetation was described using the Braun-Blanquet approach; the botanical composition and the biomass of herbs were assessed by their cutting and weighing. Nematode communities were characterized by their taxonomic diversity, population density, and eco-trophic structure. The analysis of soil profiles demonstrated that the thickness of the peat deposits decreased over 40 years of observation (1974-2015). The direction of vegetation succession on sown meadows was dictated by the type of fertilization. Two plant communities were formed: Deschampsieta caespitosae humidiherbosum developed on the plots treated with mineral fertilizers, and Elytrigeto magnograminosoherbosum community developed on the plots treated with mineral and organic fertilizers. The main changes in soil nematode communities during the long-term succession were related to their eco-trophic structure. Two trophic groups exhibited an obvious response: the relative abundance of nematodes associated with plants decreased, whereas the share of plant-parasitic nematodes increased. In addition, it was found that the species composition of herbs predetermined the ecological specialization of dominant plant-parasitic nematode taxa.

AB A strong relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulphate (SO42-) dynamics under drought conditions has been revealed from analysis of a 10-year time series (1993-2002). Soil solution from a blanket peat at 10 cm depth and stream water were collected at biweekly and weekly intervals, respectively, by the Environmental Change Network at Moor House-Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve in the North Pennine uplands of Britain. DOC concentrations in soil solution and stream water were closely coupled, displaying a strong seasonal cycle with lowest concentrations in early spring and highest in late summer/early autumn. Soil solution DOC correlated strongly with seasonal variations in soil temperature at the same depth 4-weeks prior to sampling. Deviation from this relationship was seen, however, in years with significant water table drawdown (>-25 cm), such that DOC concentrations were up to 60% lower than expected. Periods of drought also resulted in the release of SO42-, because of the oxidation of inorganic/organic sulphur stored in the peat, which was accompanied by a decrease in pH and increase in ionic strength. As both pH and ionic strength are known to control the solubility of DOC, inclusion of a function to account for DOC suppression because of drought-induced acidification accounted for more of the variability of DOC in soil solution (R-2=0.81) than temperature alone (R-2=0.58). This statistical model of peat soil solution DOC at 10 cm depth was extended to reproduce 74% of the variation in stream DOC over this period. Analysis of annual budgets showed that the soil was the main source of SO42- during droughts, while atmospheric deposition was the main source in other years. Mass balance calculations also showed that most of the DOC originated from the peat. The DOC flux was also lower in the drought years of 1994 and 1995, reflecting low DOC concentrations in soil and stream water. The analysis presented in this paper suggests that lower concentrations of DOC in both soil and stream waters during drought years can be explained in terms of drought-induced acidification. As future climate change scenarios suggest an increase in the magnitude and frequency of drought events, these results imply potential for a related increase in DOC suppression by episodic acidification.

AB A total of 233 samples from the upper 16 m of the Toushe peat core retrieved in central Taiwan were measured for TOC and delta C-13(TOC) values. From these samples, 17 selected samples with large delta C-13(TOC) fluctuations were analyzed for n-alkane and delta D of the C27 and C29 n-alkanes. Combining with the detailed high-resolution pollen and geochemical records, this study reveals more detailed climatic variations in terms of temperature and precipitation as well as abrupt climatic events during the past 30 Kyrs. Before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), climate was cold and damp with predominantly woodland vegetation in Toushe Basin, and turned to cold and dry after 25 Kyr BP. Climatic conditions there were the worst during LGM over the past 30 Kyrs, especially around 23 and 18 Kyr BP when the woodland was diminished and C4 grass was dominated. Although short durations of relatively wet conditions could be found at 17, 16 and 14 Kyr BP, cold and dry climates were prevailing during 29.5-28, 24-22, 17-15 and 13-11.5 Kyr BP, corresponding to Heinrich (H) Events 3, 2, 1, and Younger Dryas (YD), respectively. During the early Holocene, dry climate occurred at similar to 11, similar to 10, 9.7-9.2 and similar to 8 Kyr BP; whereas wet condition appeared at 10.3, 9.8, 9-7.5 Kyr BP. In the middle Holocene, climate kept warm and moderate wet in the first half period, but many dry events existed in the second half following a cold and dry event at 6 Kyr BP. After a sharply warm peak at 5.2 Kyr BP, the climate in Toushe turned to cold quickly, and tree/shrub vegetation disappeared completely with the replacement of C3 grasses. In the late Holocene, climate was relatively wetter with predominant C3 grasses in the basin. Our climatic interpretations based on the peat records agree well with the Greenland ice core and Chinese speleothem records on millennium time scales during the last glacial period. Dry climates corresponding to weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) during the Heinrich events and Younger Dryas in central Taiwan and eastern China demonstrate the climatic forcing on such long time scales in concert with regional monsoon climate. However, the discrepancies exist between our peat record and the Dongge/Hulu stalagmite record on: (1) the age of H2; (2) climate intensities of LGM and HI; and (3) wetness condition during Holocene. These observations call for further study on high-resolution climatic changes especially on moisture budget in the East Asian monsoonal region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands in mid-high latitude regions play a vital role in climate change, due to their high organic carbon density. Nonetheless, the stabilization of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions in these regions is largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to examine the changes in SOC and its fractions along a latitudinal gradient and to analyze the influencing factors in the southern margin of the permafrost region on the Eurasian continent. Topsoil (0-20 cm) was collected from five wetlands along a latitudinal gradient in Northeast China. We analyzed SOC and some labile fractions. Our results demonstrated that wetland SOC and its labile fractions concentration declined with decreasing latitude. The Permafrost regions had greater organic carbon content than the regions with seasonally frozen ground. The light fraction organic carbon and particulate organic carbon accounted for 5-83% and 21-32%, respectively, of the SOC and were particularly enriched in the permafrost region. Microbial biomass carbon and dissolved organic carbon showed a similar decreasing trend to that of SOC. At the same latitude, vegetation affected SOC stock and the dynamics of its labile fractions. Therefore, wetlands in mid-high latitudes contain a large carbon pool, and carbon stock varies with latitude. Although the labile fractions were higher in the permafrost region, their activities were lower, due to low temperature and poor nutrient status. Under global warming, the labile carbon pool may be mobilized and contribute to the greenhouse effect. Moreover, vegetation differences should be considered in obtaining an accurate carbon calculation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The major part of the north polar region is intensely rising by postglacial crustal movement. This process gives rise to the separation of different basins from seas and oceans, which affects a combination of freshwater and marine organisms. Gradually losing contact with the seas, many near-shore lakes of the Arctic are mostly desalted and form bogs. Fungi as decomposers play an important role in all ecosystems. However, the diversity and role of fungi in Arctic aquatic ecosystems is largely unknown. It is also not clear how the taxonomic structure of the fungal community is affected by the process of gradual desalinization and waterlogging. We investigated the diversity of filamentous culturable fungi in different parts of the brackish Kislo-Sladkoe Lake (White Sea, Russia). Annually, 42 samples of the bottom and coastal soils have been collected at the lake from which fungi were recovered on standard and selective media. Based on morphological and molecular markers, a total of 127 taxa have been identified. The fungal community appeared to be influenced by its sea origin and comprised both marine (Paradendryphiella salina, Acremonium spp.) and terrestrial soil species of Penicillium, Talaromyces, Mucor, Umbelopsis, Cladosporium, Cadophora, Sistotrema, Helotiales, Pleosporales, sphagnum moss destructors (Oidiodendron spp.) and insect-associated species of Tolypocladium. The results indicate that the composition of the fungal community in the rising polar White Sea region reflects the dynamics of global changes in physical-chemical parameters and animal and plant associations because of separation from the sea.

AB Mechanisms influencing retention, biogeochemical cycling, and release of legacy mercury within soils of forests and wetlands remain poorly understood. We quantified mercury pool size and stoichiometry with carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur across forest-wetland transects and among wetlands of different hydrogeologic settings in the Adirondack region of New York State. Average total mercury pool size in soils (to 50 cm depth) was greater in forests (17.5 mg/m(2)) than in wetlands (6.1 mg/m(2); p<0.010). The average mercury pool size (to 50 cm depth) in shallow-peat riparian wetlands (9.3 mg/m(2)) was greater than in deep-peat riparian (5.4 mg/m(2); p=0.099) or headwater wetlands (3.6 mg/m(2); p=0.046). Accumulation of mercury was enhanced at the forest-wetland interface. In mineral horizons of the forest soil and in shallow-peat riparian wetlands, mercury was positively correlated with carbon (r(2)=0.73-0.96) and nitrogen (r(2)=0.82-0.93), but not sulfur. In contrast, mercury and sulfur were strongly correlated in headwater wetland peat (r(2)=0.73). Dissolved mercury was correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water and stream water of deep-peat and shallow-peat riparian wetlands (r(2)=0.46-0.73), but not in headwater wetland pore water. In headwater outlet streams, dissolved mercury was correlated with DOC (r(2)=0.62), but the slope was only one third that in riparian streams. Hydrogeologic setting influences decomposition processes, biogeochemical cycling of mercury, and hydrologic transport that in turn, govern the size and stoichiometry of mercury pools across the upland-wetland interface and among different wetland types. Ultimately, mobilization of legacy mercury into aquatic ecosystems from forest soils and wetlands likely depends upon decomposition dynamics and hydrologic flow paths.

AB Noeggerathiales are an extinct group of spore-bearing plants of uncertain systematic position that are known from Carboniferous and Permian age Euramerican and Cathaysian floras that occurred in present-day Europe, North America, and East Asia. The order Noeggerathiales includes over 50 species of more than 20 fossil genera, but their paleoecology is not well understood yet. Previously this group had been found only in extrabasinal floras or those inhabiting clastic wetlands. Noeggerathiales have never been recorded in coal ball floras. Thus, it is up to now uncertain whether this group has contributed to the formation of coal. Recent investigations of an Early Permian peat-forming flora of the Taiyuan Formation near Wuda, Inner Mongolia, which was preserved in a volcanic ash fall has provided evidence that noeggerathialean plants not only existed in the peat-forming vegetation but could even be the dominant group in some areas of the coal swamp. The Noeggerathiales in this particular peat-forming forest include Tingia unita, Paratingia wudensis, and a new species of Paratingia. Exceptionally well-preserved specimens indicate that these noeggerathialean plants are small trees with a canopy of compound leaves and strobili near the top of an unbranched (monocaulous) stem.

AB Sediment magnetic properties of a short core from Sharkey Lake, MN, record the effects of Euroamerican settlement and climate change over the last 150 yr. The onset of European-style farming led to increased erosion, reflected in high values of concentration-dependent parameters such as magnetic susceptibility (kappa), Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM), and Anhysteretic Remanent Magnetization (ARM). These high values are only partially due to increased supply of terrigenous material to the lake, and recent sediment contains an additional component of authigenic fine (single-domain) magnetite, most likely magnetosomes from magnetotactic bacteria. High organic productivity in the lake during the 1920s to 1940s drought increased this authigenic component resulting in highly magnetic fine-grained sediment. A comparison with older Holocene sediment from the same lake shows that, over time, most of the fine magnetic signal is lost after deposition, leading to decreases in magnetization and a bimodal grain size distribution of ultrafine, superparamagnetic grains and coarser multidomain particles, evident from measurements of ARM/IRM ratios, hysteresis measurements, and low-temperature analyses. The effects of dissolution and the superposition of climate and land-use signals complicate the use of recent sediments as modem analogs for sediment magnetic analyses.

ID GAMMA-RAY ATTENUATION; SPATIAL PREDICTION; SAMPLING DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION
AB Remote sensors provide high resolution data over large spatial extents that can potentially be used to map soil properties such as the concentration of organic carbon or its moisture content. The sensors rarely measure the property of interest directly but instead measure a related property. There is a need to make ground measurements of the property of interest to calibrate a model or relationship between the soil property and the sensor data.
   We develop a framework for optimizing the locations and number of ground measurements of a soil property for surveys incorporating sensor data. The data are used to estimate a linear mixed model of the property where the fixed effects are a flexible spline-based function of the sensor measurements.
   The framework is used to map peat depth across a portion of Dartmoor National Park using radiometric potassium data measurements from an airborne survey. The most accurate maps result from using a geostatistical predictor to combine the relationship with the sensor data and the spatial correlation amongst the peat depth measurements. The optimal sampling designs suggest that ground measurements should be focussed where peat depths are largest and most uncertain. When measurements are made at 25 optimally selected sites, predictions that do not utilise the sensor data have 20% larger root mean square errors than those that do. For 200 ground measurements this benefit is 14%. The maps produced using the sensor data and 25 ground measurements have smaller root mean square errors than those based only upon 200 ground measurements.

AB Trichoderma isolates were added to a range of peat-based growing media as a dried fermenter biomass to study the prospects of general use in promoting bedding plant growth.
   The responses of marigold plants in peat/grit compost, petunia plants in peat/sand compost and verbena plants in Fisons M2 compost to inoculation with a range of Trichoderma strains applied as dry fermenter biomass were studied.  In tests with marigold seedlings, T. harzianum strains WT, T35 and 20 and T. viride strain 47 applied at a rate of 1% w/v showed increases in shoot fresh and dry weights of up to 40% and 52%, respectively, and T. harzianum strains T35 and 20 increased the number of flowers by up to 40%.  In tests with petunia plants, T. harzianum strain TH1 applied at a rate of 0.1% w/v increased the shoot fresh weight by 82% and dry weight by 87%.  The number of flowers and buds were increased with strain TH1 at application rates of 0.1% and 0.01% w/v and with T. harzianum strain T12B applied at a rate of 0.1% w/v by up to 227%.  In tests with verbena seedlings, T. harzianum strains WT and 20 and T. viride strains 75, 92 and T8 were applied at 0.3, 0.7 and 1.0% w/v.  Depending on concentration, each strain was able to increase either number of flowers, weight of flowers, shoot fresh weight or shoot dry weight, but only WT applied at 1% w/v increased all these parameters.  Thus Trichoderma biomass can increase flowering and shoot growth of petunia, marigold and verbena under a range of cultural conditions.

AB Since each greenhouse gas (GHG) has its own radiative capacity, all three gasses (CO2, CH4 and N2O) must be accounted for by calculating the net global warming potential (GWP) in a crop production system. To compare the impact of GHG fluxes from the rice growing and the fallow season on the annual gas fluxes, and their contribution to the GWP and carbon sequestration (CS) were evaluated. From May to April in Bibai (43 degrees 18 ' N, 141 degrees 44 ' E), in central Hokkaido, Japan, three rice paddy fields under actual management conditions were investigated to determine CS and the contribution of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes to GWP. Methane and N2O fluxes were measured by placing the chamber over the rice plants covering four hills and CO2 fluxes from rice plants root free space in paddy fields were taken as an indicator of soil microbial respiration (R-m) using the closed chamber method. Soil CS was calculated as the difference between net primary production (NPP) and loss of carbon (C) through R-m, emission of CH4 and harvest of crop C. Annual cumulative R-m ranged from 422 to 519 g C m(-2) yr(-1); which accounted for 54.7 to 55.5% of the rice growing season in particular. Annual cumulative CH4 emissions ranged from 75.5 to 116 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and this contribution occurred entirely during the rice growing period. Total cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.091 to 0.154 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and from 73.5 to 81.3% of the total N2O emissions recorded during the winter-fallow season. The CS ranged from -305 to -365 g C m(-2) yr(-1), suggesting that C input by NPP may not be compensate for the loss of soil C. The loss of C in the winter-fallow season was much higher (62 to 66%) than in the growing season. The annual net GWP from the investigated paddy fields ranged from 3823 to 5016 g CO2 equivalent m(-2) yr(-1). Annual GWP(CH4) accounted for 71.9 to 86.1% of the annual net GWP predominantly from the rice growing period. These results indicate that CH4 dominated the net GWP of the rice paddy.

AB A small paleolagoon along the margin of the glacial Lake Algassiz basin near Wampum, Manitoba, 130 km southeast of Winnipeg, contains an unusually thick and continuous sequence of late-glacial and Holocene organic sediment. Cores at 17 sites through this sequence provide insight into the fluctuations of the level of Lake Agassiz, the timing of the construction of the lake's most extensive strandline (the Upper Campbell beach), and the paleoecology of this area during the past 10 000 C-14 yr. The history of this area is established from 26 new AMS radiocarbon dates, siliceous microfossils, plant macrofossils, mineralogy; sediment characteristics, and stratigraphic relationships.
   Following deglaciation at Wampum about 11 C-14 ka, deposition of largely unfossiliferous silty clay with occasional ice-rafted clasts represents relatively deep-water conditions in Lake Agassiz. Overlying this is a spatially and temporally variable mixture of silt, sand, peat, gyttja, and marl, containing an allochthonous assemblage of siliceous microfossils and plant macrofossils with a wide range of radiocarbon dates. These sediments were deposited in an embayment of Lake A gassiz, mainly in shallow, quiet waters, as the lake transgressed about 10 ka over the Moorhead low-water phase surface, Between about 9.7 and 9.3 ka, the Wampum embayment was progressively isolated from Lake Agassiz by growth of the Upper Campbell spit, resulting in the formation of a lagoon. Organic-rich deposits on the lakeward side of the lagoon were buried 9.3-9.4 ka by sand and gravel of the spit, and a thin overwash of sand marks this event throughout the lagoon. At about this time, Lake Agassiz fell below the Upper Campbell beach level. Subsequent accumulation at Wampum consists mainly of algal gyttja during the early Holocene and mart during the middle Holocene; only minor fluctuations in hydrological conditions occurred, except for slightly warmer and drier conditions between 6.2 and 4.0 C-14 ka, These stable, shallow-water conditions may he due partly to persistent groundwater contributions to the site. Progressive encroachment of rooted aquatics led to present-day fen conditions; peat accumulation across the basin began by about 4.0 ka.

AB As the largest biogeochemically active terrestrial reserve of carbon (C), soils have the potential to either mitigate or amplify rates of climate change. Ecosystems with large C stocks and high rates of soil C sequestration, in particular, may have outsized impacts on regional and global C cycles. Montane meadows have large soil C stocks relative to surrounding ecosystems. However, anthropogenic disturbances in many meadows may have altered the balance of C inputs and outputs, potentially converting these soils from net C sinks to net sources of C to the atmosphere. Here, we quantified ecosystem-level C inputs and outputs to estimate the annual net soil C flux from 13 montane meadows spanning a range of conditions throughout the California Sierra Nevada. Our results suggest that meadow soils can be either large net C sinks (577.6 +/- 250.5 g C m(-2) y(-1)) or sources of C to the atmosphere (- 391.6 +/- 154.2 g C m(-2) y(-1)). Variation in the direction and magnitude of net soil C flux appears to be driven by belowground C inputs. Vegetation species and functional group composition were not associated with the direction of net C flux, but climate and watershed characteristics were. Our results demonstrate that, per unit area, montane meadows hold a greater potential for C sequestration than the surrounding forest. However, legacies of disturbance have converted some meadows to strong net C sources. Accurate quantification of ecosystem-level C fluxes is critical for the development of regional C budgets and achieving global emissions goals.

AB Rapid climate change at high latitudes is projected to increase wildfire extent in tundra ecosystems by up to fivefold by the end of the century. Tundra wildfire could alter terrestrial silica (SiO2) cycling by restructuring surface vegetation and by deepening the seasonally thawed active layer. These changes could influence the availability of silica in terrestrial permafrost ecosystems and alter lateral exports to downstream marine waters, where silica is often a limiting nutrient. In this context, we investigated the effects of the largest Arctic tundra fire in recent times on plant and peat amorphous silica content and dissolved silica concentration in streams. Ten years after the fire, vegetation in burned areas had 73% more silica in aboveground biomass compared to adjacent, unburned areas. This increase in plant silica was attributable to significantly higher plant silica concentration in bryophytes and increased prevalence of silica-rich gramminoids in burned areas. Tundra fire redistributed peat silica, with burned areas containing significantly higher amorphous silica concentrations in the O-layer, but 29% less silica in peat overall due to shallower peat depth post burn. Despite these dramatic differences in terrestrial silica dynamics, dissolved silica concentration in tributaries draining burned catchments did not differ from unburned catchments, potentially due to the increased uptake by terrestrial vegetation. Together, these results suggest that tundra wildfire enhances terrestrial availability of silica via permafrost degradation and associated weathering, but that changes in lateral silica export may depend on vegetation uptake during the first decade of postwildfire succession.
   Plain Language Summary Climate change in the Arctic is leading to more frequent and severe wildfire in Arctic tundra ecosystems. Studying the silica (SiO2) cycle in Arctic ecosystems is important because the amount of silica exported from land to sea can control uptake by marine primary producers in Arctic coastal waters. We investigated how tundra wildfire affects silica cycling by returning to a large Arctic wildfire 10 years after the burn to collect samples of stream water, vegetation, and peat. We found that plants growing on burned landscapes contained 73% more silica in their aboveground biomass compared to unburned areas nearby. While the fire thawed permafrost underneath it, we did not observe increased levels of silica in streams draining burned areas. This pattern indicates that elevated rates of silica uptake via plants may prevent increased silica export to marine waters following tundra wildfire. We conclude that the effect of tundra fire on silica cycling depends on the recovery trajectories of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the Arctic.
   Key Points
   After the largest Arctic tundra fire in recent times, burned vegetation had 73% more silica in aboveground biomass, due to higher plant silica concentration in bryophytes and increased prevalence of silica-rich gramminoids in burned areas Wildfire redistributed peat silica stocks, with higher concentrations, but 29% lower total stocks due to shallower peat layer postburn Dissolved silica concentration in tributaries draining burned catchments did not differ from unburned catchments, indicating that accelerated vegetation uptake may limit lateral silica export during the first decade of post wildfire succession

AB Plants growing in salt-affected soils may have retarded growth and inhibited or altered metabolic processes. This study aims at investigating the impact of subsurface soil salinity on root growth and metabolic processes in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). The seeds of perennial ryegrass (cv. Quick Start II) were planted in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes (10 cm diameter x 42 cm long) for 2 months. The experiment consisted of three treatments: 1) control, 40 cm filled with sand-peat mixture (7 sand : 3 peat wt/wt); 2) T20, a 20-cm-deep layer of saline soil covered with a 20-cm-deep layer of sand-peat mixture; and 3) T30, a 30-cm-deep layer of saline soil covered with a 10-cm-deep layer of sand-peat mixture. Our study showed that soil salinity at the subsurface inhibited the growth of perennial ryegrass roots. Compared with the control, the root activity in saline soil layer decreased, whereas it remained high in themixture-soil zone. The content of amino acids in the roots obtained from the surface soil (0-10 cm) in T30 was greater than that in both the T20 and the control regimes. The content of soluble sugars in the roots went up with the decrease of the depth of sand-peat mixture. The increased root activity and free amino acids content in the roots sampled from the upper soil layers coupled with the increased soluble sugars in the roots subjected to soil salinity stress in the bottom soil layer represents some adaptive responses and regulative mechanisms in perennial ryegrass.

AB As a multiple function tree species, Cyclocarya paliurus (Batal) Iljinskaja is mainly planted and managed for timber production and medical use. To improve the seed use efficiency and outplanting performance of C. paliurus, the effects of container types and growth medium on the seedling growth and root morphology of C. paliurus were investigated by using a completely randomized block experimental design with a 4 x 3 factorial arrangement during nursery culture. Both container type and growth medium significantly affected the growth, biomass, and root morphological indexes of C. paliurus seedlings, but container size had a greater effect on the seedling quality of C. paliurus than the growth medium formula. The root-collar diameter and height of the seedlings were positively and significantly correlated with the biomass variables and root morphological variables, and could be considered essential attributes for evaluating seedling quality. Based on the results from this study, the management regime used here in C. paliurus seedling production is suggested to ensure good quality seedling delivery. Our study provides not only valuable insights into the container seedling culture of C. paliurus, it also enables nursery managers to optimize seedling production.

AB The aim of this study was to establish the main drivers of the spatial variability in growing season CH4 flux within an arctic wetland ecosystem. During 3 years (2011-2013) we measured CH4 flux and potential drivers, e.g., CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration), temperature, water table depth, pore-water concentration of organic acids (e.g., acetate) and the vascular plant composition and density. The study included 16-20 main plots (C-main) and in 2013 also experimental plots (10 excluded muskoxen grazing, 9 snow fence and 10 automated chamber plots) distributed over 0.3 km(2). The results show a 1.8-times difference in CH4 flux magnitude inter-annually and 9- to 35-times spatially (depending on year and treatment). During all 3 years GPP was a strong driver of the variability in C-main plots. Accordingly, the plant productivity related variables NEE, GPP and acetate were singled out as the strongest drivers of the variability in 2013, when all variables were measured on a majority of the plots. These variables were equally strong drivers of the spatial variability in CH4 flux regardless of whether experimental plots were included in the analysis or not. The density of Eriophorum scheuchzeri was the strongest driver of the spatial variability in NEE, GPP and acetate. In conclusion, changes in vegetation composition or productivity of wet arctic ecosystems will have large impacts on their carbon balance and CH4 flux, irrespective of whether these changes are driven directly by climate change or by biotic interactions, such as grazing.

AB A system of sand talus cones in a small forested rocky sandstone area was investigated to determine the importance of disturbance-related dynamics and mesoclimate to vegetation differentiation. These cones (usually 3-12 m long) are formed by the accumulation of sand at the foot of sandstone rocks and are subject to frequent disturbance by the transport of sand. Vegetation was recorded both at the whole-cone level and at the within-cone level; the latter was approached by means of a transect of small squares along each cone. Soil profiles were recorded at the upper. centre and bottom parts of the cones. To express mesoclimatic differentiation among the cones within the rocky area, the potential insolation was calculated from the horizon angular height and the likelihood of thermal inversions was estimated by the height of the cones above the valley bottom.
   The major environmental factor correlated with variation in cone vegetation is the disturbance dynamics as determined by the structure of the soil profiled active cones (with sand at the surface) are colonized by different species as compared with non-active cones (with surface covered by humus sediments). There is a clear primary succession gradient from plants able to cope with continuous sand transport to stands of tall bryophytes, small shrubs and herbs. Quite often the same gradient is found within cones, with late successional vegetation confined to the lower, stabilized parts of the cones. while the upper part is still being affected by sand transport. The differentiation along the gradient of disturbance is much stronger than the differentiation due to climatic or other gradients.
   Indirect data indicate that the long-term average rate of sand accumulation is ca. 1 mm/yr. If sand transport ceases, Sphagnum peat accumulates on some of the cones the depth of accumulated Sphagnum remains may reach 50 cm, The development of the peat layer is but weakly correlated with the measured variables suggesting that random processes at the beginning of Sphagnum establishment may be a driving force, By measuring Sphagnum growth and decomposition, and the peat density, we estimated the time needed for their development to be several hundreds of years.

AB Increasing rates of relative sea-level rise (RSL) have been linked to coastal wetland losses along the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. While such losses have yet to be reported for New England tidal marshes, rapidly rising RSL may still be affecting these systems. Studies of the Wequetequock-Pawcatuck tidal marshes over four decades have documented dramatic changes in vegetation that appear to be related primarily to differential rates of marsh accretion and sea-level rise. Other environmental factors such as sediment supply and anthropogenic modifications of the system may be involved as well. When initially studied in 1947-1948 the high marsh supported a Juncus gerardi-Spartina patens belting pattern typical of many New England salt marshes. On most of the marsh complex the former Juncus belt has been replaced by forbs, primarily Triglochin maritima, while the former S. patens high marsh is now a complex of vegetation types-stunted Spartina alterniflora, Distichlis spicata, forbs, and relic stands of S. patens. These changes are documented by vegetation sampling that closely followed the 1947-1948 methods and by peat core analysis. Marsh elevations were determined by leveling, and the mean surface elevation of areas where the vegetation has changed is significantly lower than that of areas still supporting the earlier pattern (4.6 vs. 13.9 cm above mean tide level). The differences in surface elevation reflect differences in accretion of marsh peat. Calculations based on sandy overwash layers deposited during historically recorded storms as well as on experimentally placed marker horizons of known age indicate that stable areas have been accreting at the rate of local sea-level rise, 2.0-2.5 mm/yr at least since 1938; changed areas have accreted at about one half that rate. Lower surface elevations result in greater frequency and duration of tidal flooding, and thus in increased peat saturation, salinity, and sulfide concentrations, and in decreased redox potential, as directly measured over the growing season at both changed and stable sites. It is proposed that these edaphic changes have combined to favor establishment of a wetter, more open vegetation type dominated by two distinctive communities-stunted S. alterniflora and forbs. Changes documented on the Wequetequock-Pawcatuck system have been observed on other Long Island Sound marshes and may serve as a model for the potential effects of sea-level rise on New England tidal salt marshes.

AB We have studied the thermal stability of the Cu and Fe nitrides. These results show that a nanometer-thick Cu nitride film decomposes at the Fe(4)N growth temperature. Considering this, we propose for their use in spintronics, the room temperature growth of a nonmagnetic (FeN)/semiconducting (Cu(3)N) epitaxial nitride bilayer that transforms into a ferromagnetic (Fe(4)N)/metallic (Cu) one by mild thermal annealing at 700 K. This process can be employed to locally decompose by laser (or ion) irradiation FeN/Cu(3)N/Fe(4)N) trilayers, giving rise to an array of lithographically defined Fe(4)N/Cu/Fe(4)N spin valves surrounded by metal/semiconductor spacers.

AB The stable isotope compositions of moss tissue water (delta H-2 and delta O-18) and cellulose (delta C-13 and delta O-18), and testate amoebae populations were sampled from 61 contemporary surface samples along a 600-km latitudinal gradient of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) to provide a spatial record of environmental change. The isotopic composition of moss tissue water represented an annually integrated precipitation signal with the expected isotopic depletion with increasing latitude. There was a weak, but significant, relationship between cellulose delta O-18 and latitude, with predicted source water inputs isotopically enriched compared to measured precipitation. Cellulose delta C-13 values were dependent on moss species and water content, and may reflect site exposure to strong winds. Testate amoebae assemblages were characterised by low concentrations and taxonomic diversity, with Corythion dubium and Microcorycia radiata types the most cosmopolitan taxa. The similarity between the intra- and inter-site ranges measured in all proxies suggests that microclimate and micro-topographical conditions around the moss surface were important determinants of proxy values. Isotope and testate amoebae analyses have proven value as palaeoclimatic, temporal proxies of climate change, whereas this study demonstrates that variations in isotopic and amoeboid proxies between microsites can be beyond the bounds of the current spatial variability in AP climate.

AB We estimated CH4 and N2O emissions from the main land-use types in rural landscapes using data from the literature (950 study sites/experiments from the temperate and boreal zone published from 1980 to 2009 in 165 scientific papers indexed by the ISI Web of Science) and assessed the emission potential of CH4 and N2O from rural landscapes in Estonia. According to this analysis, natural peatlands and marshes appeared to be the most important CH4 emitters, whereas N2O is emitted mainly from drained peatlands and marshes, set aside areas, conventional arable lands, fertilized grasslands, and coniferous and mixed forests - all on hydromorphic soils. The estimated median value of annual CH4-C and N2O-N fluxes for Estonian rural landscapes are 25,519 and 11,050t respectively. CH4 consumption makes up 13.2% of the emission. The largest CH4 emitters are peatlands (17,746 tCH(4)-C year(-1); 60%), whereas coniferous and mixed forests on hydromorphic soils with altered hydrologic regime are responsible for the bulk (51%) of N2O fluxes. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of Estonian rural land-use types (42,685 km(2)) from potential CH4 and N2O fluxes is 5.99 million t of CO2 equivalents, of which N2O is responsible for 86%. Several measures for the further mitigation of greenhouse gas emission from rural landscapes are proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil samples from the upper 10-cm-thick layer of the humus horizon (without forest litter) were taken in Podol'sk and Serpukhov districts (1130 and 1080 km(2), respectively) of Moscow oblast. At each sampling site, ecosystem (forest, plowland, or fallow), soil (soddy-podzolic, soddy-gley, bog-podzolic, meadow alluvial, gray forest, and anthropogenically transformed soils of lawns and industrial zones), predominant vegetation, and topography (floodplain and low, medium, and upper parts of watersheds) were determined. The carbon content of the microbial biomass (C-mic) was determined by the method of substrate-induced respiration; we also determined the rate of basal (microbial) respiration (BR) and the organic carbon content, pH, and particle-size distribution. Overall, 237 samples from Serpukhov district and 45 samples from Podol'sk district were analyzed. The BR/C-mic ratios (respiration quotient qCO(2)) and C-mic/C-org ratios were calculated. The Cmic content in the soils ranged from 43 to 1394 mu g C/kg; the BR varied from 0.06 to 25 mu g CO2-C/g per h, qCO(2), from 0.34 to 6.52 mu g CO2-C/mg C-mic per h; and the C-mic/C-org ratio, from 0.19 to 10.65%. It was found that the most significant factors affecting the variability of the C-mic and BR are the parameters of ecosystem (50% and 80%, respectively) and soil (30% and 9%, respectively). The most significant variability of these indices was found in forest soils; it was mainly controlled by the soil texture (33 and 23%) and the C-org content (19 and 24%). The C-mic parameter made it possible to differentiate the soils of the territory for the purposes of their evaluation, monitoring, and biological assessment more clearly than the BR value and the soil chemical characteristics.

AB We report the formation of a stable iron nitride thin film following the exposition of an Fe(001) single crystal to atomic N plasma produced by means of a radio-frequency (rf) discharge source. The obtained phase, enabled by N-atomic diffusion into the iron matrix, has been characterized using spectroscopical and structural techniques. The comparison of the experimental results with first-principles calculations sheds light on the formed structure stability. The result is the formation of a metallic non-magnetic protective coating film on the iron substrate with a zinc blende (ZB) structure (gamma ''-FeN). The formed film has high oxidation resistance, metallic character, non-magnetic ground state and good epitaxial growth. Thermal treatment of the iron nitride film shows that, at around 700 K, the FeN is decomposed, resulting in bcc Fe as a consequence of the high diffusivity of N in Fe.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effects of soil conditioners on the structure stability of degraded soil. Biomass ash, lime, lime with zeolite, biological fertilizer and peat ash, mixed with chemical fertilizer were selected as soil conditioners. A pot experiment with degraded clay loam soil (a Cambisol) was carried out. The stability of soil aggregates was analyzed by the Le Bissonnais method. The results showed that macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm) of biomass ash treatment in fast wetting test stayed stable compared with others. The higher mean weight diameter and geometrical mean diameter in biomass ash treatment indicated a high stability from external forces. From this study, the stability of soil aggregates was improved by the addition of biomass ash in degraded soil effectively, but more attention should be paid on soil slope protection during heavy-rain seasons.

AB A laboratory-scale column experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of organic carbon amendments on the mobility of As. Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl and Zn in mine tailings. Three columns were packed with sulfide- and carbonate-rich tailings, which were amended with a 1:1 (vol.) mixture of peat and spent brewing grain at proportions of 0.2 and 5 vol.%. A simulated input solution characterized by circumneutral pH and elevated concentrations of SO(4) and S(2)O(3) was passed through the columns for 540 days. The input solution contained low concentrations of metal(loid)s during the initial 300 days and elevated concentrations thereafter. Decreases in mass transport of S(2)O(3) were observed in all columns; with increased attenuation observed at 5 vol. % organic carbon content. Removal of Mn, Ni, Cu, Sb and Mo was observed in all columns during the initial 300 days. However, during this time, mobilization of Fe, As, Zn and Pb was observed, with the greatest increases in concentration observed at the higher organic carbon content. During the final 240 days, S(2)O(3) removal was enhanced in columns containing organic carbon, and Fe, Mn. Ni, Tl, As and Sb removal also was observed. This study demonstrates the influence of organic carbon amendments on metal(loid) mobility in mine tailings. Decreases in mass discharge of metal(loid)s may be achieved using this technique; however, site-specific geochemical conditions must be considered before field-scale implementation.

AB A Holocene sequence of six alternating dune-slack features is found on the outer 2.3 km strip of coastal plain in the Haast Ecological District, south western New Zealand. Climatic conditions are strongly perhumid and mesothermal. Information on surface profile, vegetation pattern and associated environmental parameters is used to establish ecological processes operating in the system. Multivariate analyses of quantitative and floristic data from up to seven structural tiers at fifty-four sites along the sequence have revealed twelve quadrat groups (communities) and twelve generally related floristic groups. These were differentiated from the 110 vascular species and more important bryophytes of the eighty-four taxa recorded.
   A mixed podocarp-Nothofagus-broadleaved rain forest, up to 33 m tall, dominates the crests and upper slopes of the beach ridges while mostly herbaceous wetlands occupy the intervening swales. Communities are differentiated within each of these two major vegetation types largely in relation to distance from the coast, and hence age. Forest fringe woodland and shrubland vegetation of the forest-wetland ecotone constitute another five communities.
   Drainage is established as the major determinant of vegetation distribution. Environmental conditions highly favourable to paludification prevail. These account for the considerable and increasing peat depth (to 6.7 m) with distance from the coast.
   Slight doming of the wetlands, marginal lagg streams and local development of string pools indicative of patterned aapa mires are special features of the wetlands that previously were known only from localized much more elevated sites in New Zealand. Changes at various scales are operating. At the macro-scale, three major and three smaller sediment-laden rivers discharge perhaps 50 million tonnes annually on to the coast of the District. Together with some other favourable geographical features, the discharge creates a coastal environment strongly conducive to progradation. The soil sequence is marked by increasingly low nutrients, high organics, high acidity and podzolization of adequately drained sites under a forest cover, with increasing distance from the coast. At the meso-scale, processes operating at the pronounced ecotone between predominantly wooded vegetation and wetland are probably favouring the latter through paludification.
   Very high ecological and nature conservation values of this dune-slack sequence and associated vegetation pattern justify the highest status of protection. Careful management is required to ensure continued protection of the area while making it available for public access and interpretation for ecotourism within the South West New Zealand World Heritage Area.

AB The present study sought to determine the effect of spatial heterogeneity, a product of the different vegetation mosaics and environmental and structural gradients of the paramo, on the structure of anuran assemblage in a sector of Chingaza National Park. Environmental and structural variables were recorded from aerial photographs taken with a drone in six vegetation mosaics identifying landscape metrics to areas of influence of 50 and 100 m. At the end of 162 hours/person of sampling, we found 45 individuals belonging to four species. The variables mostly related to the structure of anuran assemblages varied with the spatial scale of analysis as follows: (a) at the level of the environmental-structural gradient in the vegetation mosaics (microhabitat scale), the percentage of frailejones, number of trunks of fallen frailejones, air temperature, and wind speed were the most determinant; (b) at the landscape unit level, at an area of influence of 50 m, the effect of the number of classes and in particular, the extent of peatland and peatland vegetation classes was evidenced; and (c) at an area of influence of 100 m scale, the configuration of the landscape units was most important, mainly the extension of the classes of peatland and low scrubs intermixed with pajonal and frailejonal. The results suggest that anurans present a scale-dependent response to spatial heterogeneity, an aspect that should be considered in the protected area's management plans when structuring population monitoring schemes.

AB Many streams that were channelized to facilitate timber floating in northern Sweden, have in recent years been restored by returning coarse sediment (cobbles and boulders) to the channel and reconnecting riparian with instream habitats. We asked if such restoration measures affect germination and survival of plants in the riparian zone, and if such potential effects depend on location in the catchment. We used a paired site approach, comparing the performance of Helianthus annuus (sunflower) phytometers (seeds and seedlings) in the riparian zone in channelized versus restored river reaches along climate and stream size gradients in the Vindel River catchment in northern Sweden. Phytometer survival, substrate availability, and soil nutrient content in large streams were enhanced by restoration, but overall, phytometer performance was negatively related to the length of the growing season, i.e. phytometers grew best at high altitudes and short growing seasons. This result may have been caused by less competition from the shorter and sparser neighbouring vegetation at these sites or to more frequent flooding events, enhancing retention of organic matter. Soil nutrient levels were lowest close to the coast and in large streams, probably due to deposition of mineral sediment. The higher availability of riparian habitat at restored than at channelized sites suggests that plant species richness and abundance may potentially increase after restoration. Seedling transplantation seems to be a preferable revegetation measure, because phytometer seedlings established better than seeds and survival was significantly higher at restored sites. The good plant performance at sites with short growing seasons and high altitudes suggests that, with limited resources, restoration measures should first be located to such sites.

AB Bayer process liquors present a difficult and complex matrix to the analytical chemist, and the history of the application of modern analytical techniques to this problem is a case study in innovation. All Bayer process liquors contain organic compounds, in amounts varying from traces to several grams per litre. The total organic carbon content of Bayer liquors may be less than 5 g/L up to as much as 40 g/L. The presence of these organic impurities is of concern to Bayer technologists because they can have significant impacts on the economics of the process and the quality of the product. This review examines the history and current state-of-the-art of the analysis of organics in Bayer process liquors, and provides guidance on the applicable techniques matched to a comprehensive list of the compounds most likely to be present.

AB Torrefaction process is one of the solutions to produce solid fuel from a cocoa pod shell (CPS). Fuel characteristics of CPS changed after torrefaction. Effects of torrefaction temperature and holding time on physical, thermal, and chemical properties of CPS were investigated in this study. The experiments were conducted in a tubular torrefaction reactor. Three different torrefaction temperatures of 200, 250, and 300 degrees C and four holding times of 0, 30, 60, and 90 min were considered in this investigation. It was found that the color of CPS changed from light brown to black due to the increasing content of fixed carbon and depend on the torrefaction temperature and the holding time. The decrease in the grayscale value of the torrefied CPS represented an increase in HHV. Fixed carbon content and - higher heating value (HHV) of the torrefied CPS increased up to 17.5% and 41.3% compared to the raw CPS, while the volatile matter decreased up to 19.4%. The O/C and H/C atomic ratio decreased from 0.79 and 1.68 to 0.37 and 1.01, respectively, which corresponded to the increase of carbon content and decrease of oxygen and hydrogen contents. The properties of severe torrefaction CPS resembled between lignite and peat. The grindability and hydrophobicity of CPS was improved. The CPS based biochar should be used as a substitute for solid fuel that has the same characteristic to reduce the unfavorable effects of its potassium content.

AB Different sulfur fractions of low sulfur (average 0.11%) coals from the latest Permian in southwestern China were analyzed isotopically at a high vertical resolution to examine the ramifications for potential terrestrial extinction mechanisms at the Permo-Triassic boundary. S-org (organic sulfur) accounts for 87% of the total sulfur content on average, while S-py (pyritic sulfur) is very low (13% of the total sulfur content and ca. 0.01% of the whole sample weight) and relatively constant throughout the profile except for some insignificant additions in clay-rich layers. These indicate the possible differential contribution of local diagenesis during the early stages of peat accumulation. The delta S-34(org) values have a relatively narrow range, from + 1.5 parts per thousand. to + 7.6 parts per thousand, while the delta S-34(py) values have a wider range, from + 0.8 parts per thousand. to + 34.1 parts per thousand., suggesting that pyrite was possibly formed in different stages and that there was negligible bacterial contribution to the primary organic sulfur fraction. Thus, the organic sulfur signal in the coal is largely sourced from the original plant material and records temporal variations in the isotopic composition of the sulfur input to the coal forming environment. The stratigraphically lower coal (B3) has delta S-34(org) values around + 4 parts per thousand. while the stratigraphically higher coal (B2), which is closer to the Permian-Triassic boundary, has clearly higher delta S-34(org) values, ranging from +5.3 to + 7.6 parts per thousand. This change is most likely due to increased marine sulfate aerosol inputs into the coal-forming peatland caused by coastline retreat during Late Permian transgression. Importantly, there is no evidence in these discrete intervals of coal formation to indicate a dominant role of atmospheric inputs of isotopically lighter sulfur from either H2S released from euxinic oceans or volcanic SO2. This militates against theories that implicate such sources of sulfur in terrestrial extinction mechanisms at the end-Permian. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents data on the isotopic compositions of individual carbohydrates which have been isolated from both living organisms and from a depositional environment.  Through recent developments in chromatography, isolation of monosaccharides in sufficient quantity for isotopic analysis is possible.  Carbohydrates isolated from marine and terrestrial plants and animals have carbon isotopic compositions which clearly indicate biosynthetic processes which are recognized to be associated with isotopic fractionations during the incorporation and metabolism of carbon.  Stable nitrogen isotopic compositions of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, isolated from a variety of chitins, indicate a common fractionation of nitrogen which may be associated with transamination.  This fractionation is estimated to be about -9 parts per thousand relative to the whole organism.  Through the isotopic label, the source or history of an organic material may be traced through diagenesis.  Further, production of non-indigenous carbohydrates, which may be associated with fungal or bacterial action, can be identified through depleted isotopic compositions.  Xylose, for example, isolated from a peat, was approximately 8 parts per thousand more depleted in carbon than the whole peat or mannose isolated from the same peat.  The isotopic distributions of carbohydrates isolated from living organisms are essential for the interpretation of those characterized in natural mixtures from an environment.

AB Avoiding catastrophic climate change requires rapid decarbonization and improved ecosystem stewardship. To achieve the latter, ecosystems should be prioritized by responsiveness to direct, localized action and the magnitude and recoverability of their carbon stores. Here, we show that a range of ecosystems contain 'irrecoverable carbon' that is vulnerable to release upon land use conversion and, once lost, is not recoverable on timescales relevant to avoiding dangerous climate impacts. Globally, ecosystems highly affected by human land-use decisions contain at least 260 Gt of irrecoverable carbon, with particularly high densities in peatlands, mangroves, old-growth forests and marshes. To achieve climate goals, we must safeguard these irrecoverable carbon pools through an expanded set of policy and finance strategies.
   In order to limit warming and the most severe consequences of climate change, net global carbon emissions must reach zero by 2050. Many ecosystems contain carbon that would be irrecoverable on this timescale if lost and must be protected to meet climate goals.

AB Sand-based turfgrass root zones have limited nutrient retention and water-holding capacity. Peat moss often is used to offset these deficiencies, but peat moss decomposes. Biochar is a co-product of several biofuel production processes used to produce bio-oil. Biochar is stable and could have similar water and nutrient retention impacts as peat moss when mixed in sand-based turfgrass root zones. The objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of biochar as a sand-based root zone amendment. Water retention, water infiltration, creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) rooting depth, and nutrient evaluation experiments were conducted on six sand and biochar root zone mixtures. At field capacity, sand-based media containing 25% (v/v) biochar retained 260 and 37096 more water compared to media containing 5% biochar and a pure sand control, respectively. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of the root zones decreased as biochar concentrations increased. The rooting depth of bentgrass was reduced up to 46% at biochar concentrations > 10%. Extracted pore water electrical conductivity and dissolved total organic carbon increased as biochar concentrations increased. Nitrogen leaching was reduced as biochar concentrations increased. According to the results, biochar may improve water storage, reduce overall water use, and decrease N fertilizer applications in sand-based turfgrass ecosystems.

AB A series of small, shallow seasonally, or interannually, waterlogged depressions (dambos) in the upper Zambezi Valley in western Zambia hold shallow peat deposits and are bounded on their western margin by sandy lunette dunes. Using luminescence dating of sands, fossil pollen analyses and the macrocharcoal record from cored peat, the long-term stability of these landforms and the vegetation they now support is investigated at a site east of the upper Zambezi. Although the upper lunette dune sediments accumulated between 14 +/- 2 and 6 +/- 1 ka, the onset of peat accumulation and preservation within the dambo did not occur until 2800cal a BP, suggesting that only from this point onwards were conditions stable and wet enough year-round to allow the formation and preservation of peat during this time. Results from this study indicate that the long-term behaviour of the dambo conforms to a cut-and-fill dynamic, where under more arid conditions the dambo becomes a dry pan, providing a sediment source for the adjacent lunette dune. In contrast, during wetter times, when the dambo holds surface water year-round, it becomes an organic-rich sediment repository preserving a fossil pollen record of long-term vegetation change.

AB This study deals with the issue of caking of mineral binding materials during storage and transportation. The author conducted a critical analysis of known methods for the protection of cement from exposure to moisture and water vapour. Common disadvantages of these methods are their low effectiveness and complexity of use in industrial and domestic environments. This article introduces a new method for hydrophobising construction materials using peat, which achieves high water repellency in the modified materials with relatively low expenditure on organic materials. The author proposes film coating of the mineral particles of dispersed hydrophilic materials as a protection mechanism against their undesirable exposure to moisture during storage. The insulating film consists of hydrophobic products (bitumens) released during thermal decomposition of the organic matter in peat. The estimated thickness of the bitumen film is about 12 nm and it does not adversely affect the flow properties of the powder. A model of the formation of film coatings on mineral particles is provided and their elemental chemical composition is determined. It is shown experimentally that the modified hydrophobic cement is protected from exposure to liquid vapours, and optimal values of organic component concentrations in the dispersed mineral matter that do not reduce the strength of cement mortar are identified.

AB This article presents the results of laboratory tests on soft, normally consolidated soils from the Vistula Marshlands. Samples of high-plasticity organic soils (muds) taken from 3.2.-4.0 m and 9.5-10.0 m depth, as well as peat deposit at 14.0 m, are analysed. Presented case study confirms the applicability of the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) method based on Cone Penetration Tests (CPTU) and allows for a conservative estimation of effective friction angle for muds. The plastification angle equal to 14.5 degrees for organic silt, applied in the modified NTH method, fits well the triaxial test (TX) results. Moreover, the dilative-contractive behaviour according to the CPTU soil classification based on the Robertson's proposal from 2016 corresponds well with volumetric changes observed in the consolidated drained triaxial compression tests. The internal friction angles of the Vistula Marshlands' muds and peats are lower in comparison with the database of similar soft soils.

AB A field trial was designed to test the potential of various wastes as soil amendments in horticultural production. Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L.) and carrot (Daucas carota L.) were grown during 1993-1995 under irrigation in a coarse-textured, British Columbia soil to which annual applications of 45 t ha(-1) of various organic amendments plus NPK-fertilizers had been applied. The amendments included biosolids from Vancouver, Kelowna and Penticton, biowastes from Aldergrove and Abbotsford, and peat. Yield of both chard and carrot was increased for some organic treatments plus fertilizer relative to plots receiving commercially recommended rates of NPK-fertilizer only (control plots). Leaf N, P, Zn and Cu concentrations of both crops were usually elevated, but not to toxic values, in plots receiving wastes containing high concentrations of the respective nutrients. By the end of the third growing season, extractable P, Zn and Cu increased in the surface 15 cm of soil, relative to control plots, with P and Cu increases evident to 30 cm depth. Extractable K and pH varied, with applied waste with some treatments having higher and other treatments lower values than in control plots. The cumulative evidence suggested that many locally produced biosolids and biowastes have the potential to improve soil quality and the growth of high value horticultural crops.

AB Pinus nigra is one of the most widely used tree species for reforestation within its geographical distribution, as well as being a potential substitute for other tree species in Central Europe under future climate scenarios. P. nigra is transplanted into the field as two-year or three-year old seedlings because of its relatively low growth rate in the nursery. This study investigated the effects of fertilization programs and shading on P. nigra seedlings, aiming to accelerate early growth, and thus to reduce the nursery rearing time. The experiment (a completely randomized block design) was conducted in an open-air nursery by sowing seeds from Grevena, Northern Greece, in Quick pots filled with peat and perlite in a 2:1 ratio. The seedlings were subjected to two levels of fertilization-5 and 10 g L-1 NPK (30-10-10)-and two shading levels: 50% and 70%. At the ends of the first and second nursery growing season, we recorded the seedlings' above- and below-ground morphology and biomass data. The results show that the application of all of the treatments produced seedlings which met the targeted quality standards for outplanting. However, the combination of a high fertilization rate and low shading level resulted in seedlings of a higher morphological quality, which is often considered to be an indicator for a successful seedling establishment in the field.

AB Growth and drought resistance of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta (Loud.)), and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) container seedlings, treated with paclobutrazol at different times and with concentrations up to 2.8 mM, were examined over their second growing season. In two experiments all three species were planted in sand beds in the open and subjected to different levels of moisture stress. Paclobutrazol drenches of 0.3 and 0.6 mM made twice in October, prior to planting the following March, reduced dry weight growth the least, or increased growth in lodgepole pine under dry conditions. Paclobutrazol generally decreased survival under drought stress, particularly if treatment was applied immediately before planting, rather than the previous October. In a third experiment paclobutrazol treated white spruce were grown, in 3.1 L capacity containers filled with peat and vermiculite, at different moisture supply levels and temperatures in growth chambers, Water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated from water use and increases in dry weight of these seedlings over 83 days. Paclobutrazol treatment increased WUE most strongly over the first 31 day measurement period, under all temperature and moisture conditions, but the effect was negligible during the last 24 days of the experiment, and height growth was reduced by treatment. Mineral nutrient concentrations were affected by paclobutrazol, and it was concluded that these and other responses depended partly on seedling condition at the time of treatment.

AB The linkages between methane production, transport, and release from terrestrial and aquatic systems are not well understood, complicating the task of predicting methane emissions. We present novel data examining the potential for the saturated zone of active layer soils to act as a source of dissolved methane to the aquatic system, via soil water discharge, within a headwater catchment of the continuous permafrost zone in Northern Canada. We monitored redox conditions and soil methane concentrations across a transect of soil profiles from midstream to hillslope and compare temporal patterns in methane concentrations in soils to those in the stream. We show that redox conditions in active layer soils become more negative as the thaw season progresses, providing conditions suitable for net methanogenesis and that redox conditions are sensitive to increased precipitation during a storm eventbut only in shallower surface soil layers. While we demonstrate that methane concentrations at depth in the hillslope soils increase over the course of the growing season as reducing conditions develop, we find no evidence that this has an influence on stream water methane concentrations. Sediments directly beneath the stream bed, however, remain strongly reducing at depth throughout the thaw season and contain methane at concentrations 5 orders of magnitude greater than those in hillslope soils. The extent of substreambed methane sources, and the rates of methane transport from these zones, may therefore be important factors determining headwater stream methane concentrations under changing Arctic hydrologic regimes.

AB Background: Carbon storage potential has become an important consideration for land management and planning in the United States. The ability to assess ecosystem carbon balance can help land managers understand the benefits and tradeoffs between different management strategies. This paper demonstrates an application of the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) model developed for local-scale land management at the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. We estimate the net ecosystem carbon balance by considering past ecosystem disturbances resulting from storm damage, fire, and land management actions including hydrologic inundation, vegetation clearing, and replanting.
   Results: We modeled the annual ecosystem carbon stock and flow rates for the 30-year historic time period of 1985-2015, using age-structured forest growth curves and known data for disturbance events and management activities. The 30-year total net ecosystem production was estimated to be a net sink of 0.97 Tg C. When a hurricane and six historic fire events were considered in the simulation, the Great Dismal Swamp became a net source of 0.89 Tg C. The cumulative above and below-ground carbon loss estimated from the South One and Lateral West fire events totaled 1.70 Tg C, while management activities removed an additional 0.01 Tg C. The carbon loss in below-ground biomass alone totaled 1.38 Tg C, with the balance (0.31 Tg C) coming from above-ground biomass and detritus.
   Conclusions: Natural disturbances substantially impact net ecosystem carbon balance in the Great Dismal Swamp. Through alternative management actions such as re-wetting, below-ground biomass loss may have been avoided, resulting in the added carbon storage capacity of 1.38 Tg. Based on two model assumptions used to simulate the peat system, (a burn scar totaling 70 cm in depth, and the soil carbon accumulation rate of 0.36 t C/ha(-1)/year(-1) for Atlantic white cedar), the total soil carbon loss from the South One and Lateral West fires would take approximately 1740 years to re-amass. Due to the impractical time horizon this presents for land managers, this particular loss is considered permanent. Going forward, the baseline carbon stock and flow parameters presented here will be used as reference conditions to model future scenarios of land management and disturbance.

AB Enlarging the fleet of gas carriers would make it possible to respond to the growing demand for hydrocarbon gases, but it will increase carbon dioxide emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has developed the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) with the objective of carbon emission reduction for new ships. In this paper, thirty gas carriers transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and equipped with various types of main engines are considered. As shown by the calculation of the attained EEDI, 2 of the 13 LPG carriers and 6 of the 17 LNG carriers under study do not comply with the EEDI requirements. To meet the stringent EEDI requirements, applying thermochemical regenerators (TCRs) fed by main engine exhaust gases is suggested. Mathematical modeling is applied to analyze the characteristics of the combined gas-turbine-electric and diesel-electric power plant with thermochemical recuperation of the exhaust gas heat. Utilizing TCR on gas carriers with engines fueled by syngas produced from boil-off gas (BOG) reduces the carbon content by 35% and provides the energy efficiency required by IMO without the use of other technologies.

AB Subfossil pollen from two bogs in temperature-sensitive, high-altitude regions were analysed in order to reconstruct early- to mid-Holocene summer temperature fluctuations in the Eastern Alps. The pollen records showed four centennial-scale cooling intervals with low growing-season temperatures, Resulting in decreasing pollen production and/or lower treeline position during the period 9000 - 6000 cal. BP. For the first time, the 8200 cal. BP cold event and an equivalent to the Misox cold phase in the Swiss Alps were detected in the Eastern Alps. The oscillations recorded in the pollen curves for Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra) and sedges (Cyperaceae) at c. 8200 cal. BP match, in time and magnitude, the delta(18)O excursion in the Greenland GRIP ice-core record as well as sea- surface cooling in the North Atlantic. The close congruence between the pollen records covering 3000 years and climate proxy-data from both Hemispheres indicates that large-scale environmental changes, possibly caused by North Atlantic freshwater pulses and/or fluctuations in solar activity, caused decreases in pollen production and/ or treeline shifts in the Alps. Although the 8200 cal. BP climatic deterioration was of a global character, its impact on biological productivity of temperature-sensitive sites at high altitude has only rarely been demonstrated. The data indicate that pollen analyses near and above the timberline within high-altitude, herb-dominated plant communities are of considerable and yet largely unexplored potential to detect abrupt short-term as well as long-term climatic variations.

AB Three experimental trials established from 1956 to 1959 on virgin oligotrophic peatland were selected for case studies on net present value, internal rate of return (IRR) and cost effectiveness (CE). Critical analyses of biological parameters showed that site indexes determined by top heights gave serious under-estimates of actual timber production. The stands obviously represent a subuniverse with higher pole stage stand density and higher diameter/height ratios than defined by the growth tables. Available models on biomass production were also evaluated.
   IRR for naturally seeded pine stands was about 2.6% without fertilization and 4.6% with. Planted and fertilized pine and spruce stands had 3.6% and 4.4% IRR respectively, which are higher than earlier published for such investments on oligotrophic sites.
   Net absorption of the climate gasses CO2, CH4 and N2O, expressed in CO2-equivalents per unit of cost of timber production (CE), is high for the cases in question and above the upper range of previously published figures. The CE of unfertilized naturally seeded pine is 33, of fertilized naturally seeded pine 41, of planted-fertilized pine 24 and of planted-fertilized spruce 29. Our CE-figures are high compared with the cost-effectiveness of other sector strategies of greenhouse gas reduction.

AB As a result of changed land use and concomitantly increased drainage, in combination with increased use of water for industrial, agricultural and other human purposes, there is an increasing shortage of "natural" water in many areas of The Netherlands in summer.  To compensate for this shortage, increasing amounts of hard water from the Rivers Rhine and Meuse are diverted to these lowlands.
   It is commonly assumed that the disappearance of Stratiotes aloides L. in peaty lowlands is caused by a decline of the water quality, owing to high concentrations of nutrients in the incoming water.  However, field observations in "de Weerribben", a large mire complex in The Netherlands, indicated that the decline of the water quality in this area is caused by an altered ion composition of the water.  The incoming Rhine-type water from Lake IJsselmeer is very alkaline, rich in HCO3- and SO4(2-).  These anions appear to be responsible for a change in the decomposition processes.  Consequently, the peat becomes very fine and soft, and because of increased bioturbation the water becomes turbid.  As a result of increased reduction processes in the soil there is an increased mobility of phosphorus, leading to internal eutrophication and greatly increased levels of reduced compounds such as S2-, CH4 and NH4+ in the soft, upper layer of the bottom.  Transplantation experiments with Stratiotes aloides plants showed that the plants started to decay in winter, after migration to the soft, upper sapropel layer.  Culture experiments proved that the S2- and NH4+ levels in this layer are lethal to Stratiotes plants.

Here, we established a four-level P addition experiment (0, 1.2,4.8, and 9.6 g Pm-2 year(-1)) in a N-limited freshwater wetland in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of eight years of P addition on DOC concentration, SUVA(254) (Abs(254)/DOC concentration, indicating the aromaticity of DOC), C:C ratio (Abs(400)/DOC concentration, indicating the proportion of colored humic substances in DOC), and E4:E6 ratio (Abs(465)/Abs(665), indicating the molecular size of humic substances) in surface water and soil pore water (0-15 cm depth) during the growing season (June through September). Our results showed similar changing trends in concentration and optical properties of DOC following eight years of P addition in the both surface water and soil pore water across the sampling dates. Generally, P addition decreased DOC concentration, SUVA254, and C:C ratio, and increased E4:E6 ratio, irrespective of P addition levels. These altered optical properties of DOC indicated that P addition decreased the molecular weight and aromaticity of DOC, and thus increased the quality of DOC. These results suggest P enrichment substantially reduces the quantity of DOC in N-limited temperate freshwater wetlands, and imply that increased DOC quality following P addition can further provide a positive feedback to decreased DOC pool.

AB Transformations of sodium acetate, ammonium sulphate, urea and wheat straw in peat have been studied by determining the distribution of N-15-labelled material, and by C-13 and N-15 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) using cross polarization (CP) and magic-angle spinning (MAS).  Samples of an oligotrophic blanket peat were incubated for 6 months at 15-degrees-C with N-15 ammonium sulphate, N-15 urea, 13C15N urea, N-15-labelled wheat straw or C-13 sodium acetate.  The incubated samples were separated into fractions of > 1 mm, 1-0.5 mm, 0.5-0.25 mm, 0.25-0.15 mm, 0.15-0.05 mm, 0.05-0.005 mm and a water-soluble fraction by wet sieving, and were then freeze-dried.  The distribution of N-15 between the fractions was obtained after isotope-ratio analysis by mass spectrometry, and the 0.5-0.25 mm, 0.05-0.005 mm and water-soluble fractions from the incubations were examined by C-13 and N-15 NMR.
   C-13-labelled acetate increased carbohydrate resonances in the 0.05-0.005 mm and soluble material, but an organic acid derived from the substrate was still present 6 months later.  Incorporation of N-15 from ammonium sulphate into the peat was low, and more than 50% of the added N was detected in the soluble fraction still present as (NH4+)-N-15.  As carbohydrate and soluble organic matter were detected in the peat, it was concluded that microbial activity and N immobilization were restricted by poor aeration and low pH.  Urea, in contrast, interacted with all the fractions examined, with some N-15 being incorporated into a range of compounds that included protein, peptides, amides, amino acids and carbamates or lactam derivatives.  A small proportion of labelled N-15 from wheat straw, originally present in the > 1 mm and 1-0.5 mm fractions, had moved into the 0.05-0.005 fraction during incubation and sieving.  The C-13 spectra suggested that the presence of the straw may have stimulated decomposition of the peat components.

AB Alpine wetlands in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play a crucial role in the regional hydrological cycle due to their strong influence on surface ecohydrological processes; therefore, understanding how TP wetlands respond to climate change is essential for projecting their future condition and potential vulnerability. We investigated the hydrological responses of a large TP wetland complex to recent climate change, by combining multiple satellite observations and in-situ hydro-meteorological records. We found different responses of runoff production to regional warming trends among three basins with similar climate, topography and vegetation cover but different wetland proportions. The basin with larger wetland proportion (40.1%) had a lower mean runoff coefficient (0.173 +/- 0.006), and also showed increasingly lower runoff level (-3.9% year(-1), p = 0.002) than the two adjacent basins. The satellite-based observations showed an increasing trend of annual non-frozen period, especially in the wetland-dominated region (2.64 day.year(-1), p < 0.10), and a strong extension of vegetation growing-season (0.26-0.41 day.year(-1), p < 0.10). Relatively strong increasing trends in evapotranspiration (ET) (similar to 1.00 mm.year(-1), p < 0.01) and the vertical temperature gradient above ground surface (0.043 degrees C.year(-1), p < 0.05) in wetland-dominant areas were documented from satellite-based ET observations and weather station records. These results indicate recent surface drying and runoff reduction of alpine wetlands, and their potential vulnerability to degradation with continued climate warming.

AB The article presents the results of a combination of isotopic (delta N-15 and delta C-13), geochemical (TOC, TN, C/N) and palaeobotanical investigations. They were carried out on organic matter (OM) that had been deposited from the Younger Dryas to the Subboreal chronozone in palaolake sediments (north-eastern Poland). OM from the late Younger Dryas consists only a small amount of TOC and TN, which together with the lack of aquatic macrophyte macrofossils confirm low primary production in the then reservoir. The higher values of C/N ratio (18-27) and delta C-13 (ca. -26 parts per thousand) suggest that OM was mainly terrestrial in origin. During the Preboreal chronozone (11,450-10,150 cal. BP), there was a probable deepening of the reservoir through the melting of dead ice. This might have been intensified by an increase in precipitation and a fall in evapotranspiration during the 'Preboreal oscillation'. From the early Preboreal chronozone (ca. 11,345 cal. BP), a mixed source of OM is indicated by C/N ratio (from 8 to 13). At the same time significant increase in TOC and TN probably registered a rise in primary production in the palaeolake. From the older part of the Boreal chronozone (ca. 9865 cal. BP) algae productivity increased (the C/N ratio dropped to ca. 8 and was then constant). At the beginning of the Atlantic chronozone (ca. 8650 cal. BP) a probable increase in the water level caused the partial relocation of OM from the reed swamp belt and/or the adjacent alder carr into deeper sections of the palaeolake (an increase in TOC and TN). In the late Atlantic chronozone (ca. 6965-6650 cal. BP), TOC and TN decreased while delta C-13 had high values, which probably reflected a more distinct stratification of the water column with anoxic bottom waters. Next, in the late Atlantic and early Subboreal chronozone (ca. 6650-5205 cal. BP) the amount of OM in palaeolake sediments was still rising. The delta C-13 values dropped, suggesting an intensification of processes of water mixing. These processes were simultaneous with the constant shallowing of the palaeolake and the disappearance of habitats suitable for submerged macrophytes. The topmost part of the profile is characteristic of a strong decomposition of peat, causing a release of carbon dioxide and therefore the depletion of the carbon pool in the peat (a drop in the C/N ratio). The concurrent upward trend of the delta N-15 curve is probably the effect of a greater anthropogenic impact on the palaeolake/mire and its catchment and/or more recent human interference in the topmost peat layers.

AB The productivity and decomposition of Typha orientalis at Kaitoke Swamp on Great Barrier Island, New Zealand, were measured to determine the annual dynamics of its biomass. These interactions, including peat accumulation under nutrient-rich conditions, are often poorly understood. Annual productivity and maximum "standing" above-surface and below-surface biomass were measured using sequential harvest plots. Decomposition was determined using recently dead T orientalis leaves in mesh litter bags placed on, above, and below the swamp surface.
   The annual productivity of T orientalis (c. 3 kg m(-2)) is within world-wide estimates for swamp wetland species. The order of decomposition of leaf litter at Kaitoke Swamp is: below surface > surface > above surface. Litter bag mesh size did not affect decomposition processes, indicating that larger decomposer animals probably do not have a significant influence on biomass loss in the site. Peat accumulation was estimated based on observations and measurements of the entrainment process. T orientalis had low estimated peat accumulation, with 6.5% (0.19 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) of the annual production remaining after all components had been underground for 5 years. Consequently a large amount of the annual production of biomass is lost from the site. The ratio of maximum biomass to annual productivity was 2.2, also indicating low biomass accumulation.

AB Cores of sediment from Nee Soon, a peat-forming freshwater swamp located in the perimarine zone of Singapore, have yielded a record of vegetation history that comprises parts of the last glacial and Holocene periods. The evidence includes two conventional and four AMS radiocarbon dates, the oldest of which is 23,050 +/- 330 B.P. (uncalibrated radiocarbon years), and variations in the abundances of sub-fossil pollen and spores and charcoal. The results of a study of the relationship between contemporary vegetation and modem pollen accumulation facilitated interpretation of sub-fossil tree pollen data. Peat formation occurred at Nee Soon during the last glacial, when sea levels on the Sunda continental shelf were well below those at present. The occurrence of montane pollen types, notably Podocarpaceae, in sediment samples dated to the late glacial and early Holocene suggests either temperatures substantially lower than those of the present and, possibly, humid conditions, or cold, seasonally dry climates and reduced levels of atmospheric CO2. The abundance, of charcoal indicates the widespread occurrence of fires throughout the entire period represented by the cores. For the mid Holocene, the evidence indicates an increased saline influence, presumably as a result of relatively high sea levels. Falling sea levels during the late Holocene appear to have preceded the onset of the most recent period of peat formation at Nee Soon. The evidence confirms that long (last glacial-interglacial) records of lowland vegetation history are available from terrestrial locations in the humid core of Southeast Asia and suggests that the complexity of perimarine swamp dynamics is not captured fully by Anderson's model, which assumes a close relationship between peat formation and sea level.

AB Spent mushroom substrate (SMS) is a by-product of mushroom growing. It is often classified as waste despite that it is high in organic matter and mineral micronutrient. In last 10 years, mostly in Europe and Asia, studies of potential ways of reuse of SMS were done. Most of them showed that spent mushroom substrate can be reused as a bioadditive or fertilizer. For Ukraine, where mushroom growing is on its rise, we've decided to test SMS from local producer as a fertilizer. Blueberry was selected as a test culture for this multiyear experiment. For the first year the following parameters were taken for studying: chemical composition of fertilized soil, number of soil microorganisms and the content of total microbial biomass, direction of soil microbiological processes. Spent mushroom substrate of Lentinula edodes (shiitake mushroom) was used as an experimental sample. Peat was used as a comparative sample. As a result of studying of the actual content of elements, in terms of 1 mg / 100 g of dry matter for peat, the following data were obtained: Ca2+ - 427.6, Mg2+ - 210.6, P2O5 - 78, K2O - 29.09, N ammonium - 4.0, N nitrate - 1.61. For the SMS, they were as follows: Ca2+ - 455.6, Mg2+ - 729.0, P2O5 - 338, K2O - 340.5, N ammonium - 41.0, N nitrate - 183.0. As a result of analysis of the cationic-anionic composition of the water extract, in terms of 1 mg-eq. / 100 g, the following data were obtained for peat: HCO3- - 0.15, Cl- - 0.30, Ca2+ - 0.29, Mg2+ 0.50, Na+ - 0.21, K+ - 0.10, SO42- - 1.34. For the SMS, they were as follows: HCO3- - 0.01, Cl- - 0.12, Ca2+ - 2.79, Mg2+ - 2.64, Na+ - 1.18, K+ - 4.22, SO42- - 1.31. The total salt content for peat was 0.11%, pH - 4.31. For the SMS the total salt content was 0.37%, pH - 4.04. For both soil samples the number of microorganisms and the content of total microbial biomass were determined. The enrichment of soil by SMS led to the growth of microbial biomass (406.34 +/- 38.10). In the soil fertilized by SMS decreased number of oligotrophs more than in 3 times and pedotrophic microorganisms in 2 times in compare with soil fertilized by peat. Basing on the number of soil microorganisms coefficients of mineralization,.ligotrophity, pedotrophity and transformation of organic matter were calculated. For soil fertilized by peat values of the coefficients were next: mineralization - 1.0,.ligotrophity - 1.56, pedotrophity 1.78, transformation of organic matter - 94.61. For soil fertilized by SMS we got next values: coefficient of mineralization - 1.95, coefficient of.ligotrophity - 1.21, coefficient of pedotrophity - 2.49 and coefficient of transformation of organic matter - 26.31.

AB The wetlands play an important role in carbon storage, especially at high latitudes, at which they store nearly one-third of global soil carbons. However, few studies have investigated the emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in the long-term, especially effects of freeze-thaw cycles on these gases emissions in freshwater marsh ecosystems. In this paper, we collected greenhouse gas emission data from a freshwater marsh area in China for 4 years, evaluated their release variables and speculated on their potential atmospheric impact. For this paper, we report on the CO2, CH4 and NO emission rates recorded from June 2002 to November 2005 in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China. We measured their interannual variations and fluctuations, as well as factors affecting their emissions, and estimated their regulation and freeze-thaw cycle impacts. Our results revealed obvious CO2 and CH4 emission fluctuations during the winter months, and during the freeze-thaw cycle, and a strong interannual variation during the growing season. Overall, we documented a close relationship between the CO2 and CH4 emissions, implicating some regulatory commonality. We determined that the marsh was a N2O sink during the winter, but a significant source of NO during the freeze-thaw cycle as the temperature increased, especially in early summer. During the thaw-freeze period, the N2O levels were positively correlated with the water depth. Additionally, water depth greatly governed the interannual variation of the N2O emissions from the marshes during the thaw-freeze period. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands at the interface of the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are intensive sites for mineralization of organic matter, but the contribution of winter season fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O from wetland ecosystems to annual budgets is poorly known. By using the static opaque chamber and GC techniques, fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O at two freshwater marshes in the Sanjiang Plain were measured during the winter seasons of 2002/2003 and 2003/2004 with contrasting snow conditions and flooding regimes. The results showed that there were significant interannual and spatial differences in CH4, CO2 and N2O fluxes. The Carex lasiocarpa marsh emitted more CH4 and CO2 while absorbed less N2O than the Deyeuxia angustifolia marsh during the winter seasons. Over the winter season, emissions of CH4, CO2 and N2O ranged from 0.42 to 2.41 gC/m(2), from 24.13 to 50.16 gC/m(2), and from -25.20-to -148.96 mgN/m(2), respectively. The contributions of winter season CH4 and CO2 emission to the annual budgets were 2.32%-4.62% and 22.17%-27.97%, respectively. Marshes uptake N2O during the freezing period, while release N2O during the thawing period. The winter uptake equaled to 13.70%-86.69% of the growing-season loss. We conclude that gas exchange between soil/snow and the atmosphere in the winter season contributed greatly to the annual budgets and cannot be ignored in a cool temperate freshwater marsh in Northeast China.

AB Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) interstadials are marked by a sharp increase in the atmospheric methane (CH4) concentration, as recorded in ice cores. Wetlands are assumed to be the major source of this CH4, although several other hypotheses have been advanced. Modelling of CH4 emissions is crucial to quantify CH4 sources for past climates.
   Vegetation effects are generally highly generalized in modelling past and present-day CH4 fluxes, but should not be neglected. Plants strongly affect the soil-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and the net primary production of the vegetation supplies organic matter as substrate for methanogens. For modelling past CH4 fluxes from northern wetlands, assumptions on vegetation are highly relevant since paleobotanical data indicate large differences in Last Glacial (LG) wetland vegetation composition as compared to modern wetland vegetation. Besides more cold-adapted vegetation, Sphagnum mosses appear to be much less dominant during large parts of the LG than at present, which particularly affects CH4 oxidation and transport. To evaluate the effect of vegetation parameters, we used the PEATLAND-VU wetland CO2/CH4 model to simulate emissions from wetlands in continental Europe during LG and modern climates. We tested the effect of parameters influencing oxidation during plant transport (f(ox)), vegetation net primary production (NPP, parameter symbol P-max), plant transport rate (V-transp), maximum rooting depth (Z(root)) and root exudation rate (f(ex)). Our model results show that modelled CH4 fluxes are sensitive to f(ox) and Z(root) in particular. The effects of P-max, V-transp and f(ex) are of lesser relevance. Interactions with water table modelling are significant for V-transp.
   We conducted experiments with different wetland vegetation types for Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) stadial and interstadial climates and the present-day climate, by coupling PEATLAND-VU to high resolution climate model simulations for Europe. Experiments assuming dominance of one vegetation type (Sphagnum vs. Carex vs. Shrubs) show that Carex-dominated vegetation can increase CH4 emissions by 50% to 78% over Sphagnum-dominated vegetation depending on the modelled climate, while for shrubs this increase ranges from 42% to 72%. Consequently, during the LG northern wetlands may have had CH4 emissions similar to their present-day counterparts, despite a colder climate. Changes in dominant wetland vegetation, therefore, may drive changes in wetland CH4 fluxes, in the past as well as in the future.

AB This paper illustrates the response of a fluvial depositional system to the interplay between peat compaction and clastic sediment supply, at a range of spatial and temporal scales, as documented by extensive exposures in an open-cast mine in the Most Basin, part of the Oligo-Miocene Ohre Rift (Eger Graben) basin system in the Czech Republic. The Most Basin is characterized by the occurrence of a number of phenomena resulting from syn- and post-depositional interactions between clastic sedimentary systems and the underlying accumulation of organic material that was the precursor of the main lignite seam of up to 45 m thickness. The studied strata are interpreted as deposits of an avulsive, mixed-load fluvial system. The large-scale depositional architecture documents an existence of at least five stratal packages up to 1500 m wide and up to several tens of metres thick, representing a record of long-term evolution of a clastic floodplain bordered by accumulating peat. Within each of the packages, several small-scale channel-belts were documented. Individual packages are separated by carbonaceous mudstones indicating a period of reduced clastic input and interpreted as due to avulsion of the fluvial channels out of the floodplain limit. Two main, mutually linked, processes controlled the evolution of the studied fluvial system: (i) syndepositional compaction of the underlying peat and (ii) avulsions of the channels away from the original floodplain, resulting in formation of a new floodplain. The processes which caused the channels of the Hrabak fluvial system to reach the avulsion threshold were: (i) decrease of rate of creation of accommodation leading to increased sinuosity and thus to a decreased channel slope, and (ii) cross-floodplain tilting of the channel belt caused by differential compaction of underlying organic-rich substratum.

AB This study reconstructed the vegetation dynamics and associated climate change of the past similar to 4100 years based on the pollen data from a short peat core (i.e., KLSZ-2) in Kelashazi Peat (48.12 degrees N, 88.37 degrees E, 2422 m a.s.l.) in the Altai Mountains. The reconstructed vegetation and climate were then stacked with those from a longer peat core (i.e., KLSZ-1) to evaluate the vegetation dynamics and associated climate change of the entire Holocene and to examine the delta C-13(cellulose)- and delta O-18(cellulose)-based temperature reconstructions in the same peat. This study shows that vegetation in Kelashazi valley was dominated by alpine meadows before -8200 cal. yr BP, by taiga forests at similar to 8200-similar to 5600 cal. yr BP, and by an expansion of alpine meadows since similar to 5600 cal. yr BP. This study also examined the vegetation dynamics and associated climate in the context of the entire Altai Mountains and the surrounding areas. Our examination suggests that the forest expansion in high elevations was initiated when the temperature reached a threshold level during the early Holocene, and the forest expansion in low elevations (i.e., below the down treeline) was initiated when the moisture reached a threshold level during the middle Holocene or even late Holocene. It is also notable that the forest expansion at low elevations appears to have been longitude-dependent, i.e., time transgressive eastward. A possible mechanism to explain the longitude-dependency is that a gradual shrinking trend of the Siberian High linked to the Holocene increase in winter insolation allowed the domination of the water vapor-enriched Westerlies to gradually encroach eastward.

ID WATER MARSH; VEGETATION; NUTRIENTS; PAPYRUS; SWAMPS
AB Freshwater floating marshes cover a significant area of coastal Louisiana, USA.  These marshes consist of emergent vascular plants rooted in a surface mat of live and dead roots that grades downward into a decomposing peat layer.  The mat floats over a layer of free water underlain by highly decomposed sludge.
   We sampled the floating marsh surrounding Lake Boeuf, Louisiana, every 10 weeks over a 16 month period in 1982-1983 to quantify the concentrations of nitrogen (total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrite-nitrate and ammonium) and phosphorus (total phosphorus (TP) and phosphate) contained in interstitial water from the root mat and peat layer.  Determinations were also made for water from the free-water zone beneath the floating mat, the adjacent lake and the encircling swamp.  TKN and TP were analyzed in particulate samples from above-ground plants, roots, mat, peat and sludge.
   Both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in marsh water samples were consistently higher than in lake and swamp water samples, which were similar.  Within the floating marsh, a gradient with depth existed for TKN from the mat (160-mu-g-atoms l-1) to the peat (205-mu-g-atoms l-1) to the free-water zone (400-mu-g-atoms l-1).  Inorganic N (primarily as ammonium) accounted for a large part of this trend.  TP was also highest in the free-water zone (22-mu-g-atoms l-1) and lower in the mat and peat layers (11-13-mu-g-atoms l-1).  In below-ground solid samples, a TKN gradient with depth also existed, and highest concentrations were in the sludge (28 mg g-1), decreasing upward in the peat (25 mg g-1), mat (18 mg g-1) and roots (10 mg g-1).
   The floating marsh rises and falls with changes in local water level.  When water from the adjacent lake moves under the mat during periods of rising water, the high nutrient concentration in the free-water zone beneath the mat is diluted.  As water levels fall, nutrients move out from under the floating mat.  This flux of nutrients from the floating marsh may be an important contribution to the overall budget of the system.

AB Identifying options of climate change mitigation is of global interest to researchers. Whereas wide range of techniques of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestration have been studied in row crops and forest systems, little research has been done on the ornamental horticulture. The ornamental industrial sector has indeed some negative impacts on the global environment, but also presents opportunities to reduce GHG emissions and increase C sequestration. Thus the objective of this study was to synthesize the potential contributions of some substrates used in the horticultural sector to carbon sequestration. The specific focus of the review is on the possible use of compost, vermicompost and biochar as soilless substrate substitutes for containerized ornamental plants production. Around 11 million kilograms of sphagnum peat moss are used annually in the world for horticultural production. Therefore, the potential of using compost, vermicompost and biochar as growing media is assessed on the basis of data from greenhouse studies. Peat-based substrate can be substituted up to 30% to 35% by compost or vermicompost and up to 20% to 25% by biochar. Some examples from field studies are included to conduct the life cycle assessment of using these growth media. An estimate of C storage on the long-term basis in soil indicates up to 3 million tons of CO2 equivalent as the maximum C potential storage per year in the global productive sector if the peat-based growing media are substituted by compost/vermicompost and biochar at the ratios mentioned above. Finally, synergies between compost vermicompost and biochar are discussed when these materials are combined as growing media additives and research gaps in this area of activity have been identified for further research.

AB The Yenikoy coal field is located in a narrow area between the Black Sea coast and the Istranca (Standrja) Mountain in the Thrace Basin. The aims of this study are to characterize coal petrographical, mineralogical, palynological, geochemical, and sedimentological properties of the Yenikoy coal deposit and to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental conditions during peat accumulation. A total of 9 coal samples collected from the coal seam section are almost entirely composed of xylite-rich lithotype, and are characterized by low ash yield (7.9-21.1%, average 13.6%; on dry basis) and high total S contents (1.0-3.7%, average 2.2%; on dry basis). The macroscopic features, maceral composition, and coal fades suggest that the peat was accumulated under mesotrophic anoxic conditions, and the peat-forming vegetation consisted mainly of arboreal species (e.g. Cupressaceae, Ulmus, Carya, Zelkova, Alnus, Pterocarya and Quercus). The low HI values of the analysed samples are presumably related to presence of xylite-rich lithotype rather than the dominance of herbaceous plant and/or low preservation of organic matter in the palaeomire. Even though, relatively B-enrichments, high total S contents, and weak anomalies of some REY (e.g. Y, Ce, and Gd) in the analysed samples could refer possible sea water influence into palaeomire in the study area during Late Oligocene; the sedimentological and palynological (freshwater algaes: Pediastrurn, Spirogyra, and Mougeotia) data that indicate the palaeomire was located within a delta plain environment where small freshwater lakes and/or ponds developed. The statistical analysis and SEM-EDX data show the vast majority of elements in the analysed coal samples have inorganic affinity. The major elements Al, K, and enriched elements like B, V, Cr, Hg, and U seem to be affiliated with aluminosilicate minerals, whereas Fe, Ni, and As have probably sulphide affinity. The detrital presences of apatite crystals as detected by SEM-EDX analysis indicate that REY have mainly phosphate affinity in the analysed samples. Vertical distributions of the elements and ash yields suggest that the detrital input ratio was changeable and controlled some elemental enrichment during peat accumulation. These variations could be related to development of and fluvial conditions in the study area which interrupted peat-accumulation several times during Late Oligocene.

AB Field samples of bryophytes are highly variable in carbon isotope discrimination values (Delta a measure of (CO2)-C-13 uptake relative to (CO2)-C-12), but it is unknown what affects Delta under field conditions, or how variation in Delta relates to bryophyte performance. This study employed field and greenhouse common garden studies to evaluate the influence of microsite, seasonal, and genetic variation on Delta in peatmosses. Three species of Sphagnum that occupy hollow (S. recurvum), carpet (S. palustre), and hummock (S. tenerum) habitats were sampled for relative growth rates (RGR), C:N ratio, and Delta throughout a growing season. Values of Delta ranged from 19.0 to 27.1 parts per thousand. This variation was unrelated to species (P=0.61). However, Delta varied seasonally (P<0.001), with lower discrimination in the spring (mean 22.5 parts per thousand), followed by summer (23.8 parts per thousand) and winter (24.7 parts per thousand). There was also significant microsite variation (P=0.015) which disappeared when plants were grown in a common garden. In both spring and summer, microsite variation in Delta was inversely related to RGR (P<0.001), bur unrelated to C:N ratios (P>0.08). These results suggest that environmental, not genetic, variation at microsites affects Delta in non-vascular plants. However, environmental control of Delta is unlike that in vascular plants where water limitation lowers chloroplastic demand and increases resistance to carbon uptake. In non-vascular plants, water limitation lowers chloroplastic demand and decreases resistance to carbon uptake. These processes have additive effects and generate high spatial and seasonal variability in Delta.

AB Littoral zones at the interface of the lake and the catchment are intensive sites for mineralization of organic matter, but the contribution of vegetated littoral zone to winter fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from lake ecosystems into the atmosphere is poorly known. We studied littoral carbon gas fluxes and their spatial controls at five boreal lakes of varying trophic state during three consequent winters with contrasting snow conditions and flooding regimes. Lake-wide estimates including littoral winter release and potential pelagic spring pulse of gases were calculated for three lakes. Large interannual and spatial differences in carbon gas fluxes were controlled by the interaction of climatic factors, ice and snow cover, on-site hydrology, and apparently substrate supply from biomass production of the previous growing season. Littoral CO2 fluxes ranged from 0.9 to 7.5 mol m(-2) winter(-1), and the CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.04 to 0.38 mol m(-2) winter(-1), the latter being highest in eutrophic lakes. The vegetated littoral contributed the most (66-78%) to winter CH4 emissions from two lakes; in the smallest and most productive lake, pelagic accumulation exceeded littoral release. The large variation in littoral CO2 release could contribute to between-winter differences of 82% in lake-wide carbon gas emissions. The water level of the preceding summer and precipitation during early winter were found to be useful predictors for littoral carbon gas fluxes in winter. This suggests that the carbon gas exchange of a shallow boreal lake can be highly sensitive to changes in snowfall and subsequent flooding.

AB A function of bedding material in poultry houses is to absorb and release moisture. New bedding is commonly placed at inadequate depths in houses. Pine shavings are the industry standard for bedding material in the majority of the United States, but can be hard to obtain or costly. Alternative materials were tested for moisture absorption and retention. Peat moss and chopped wheat straw were found to absorb nearly 8x and 7x their own weight in moisture, respectively. Peat moss was then used in a broiler study and compared to fresh and used pine shavings for 6 weeks. Body weight was lower at d 7 for the used litter and peat moss treatment compared to fresh shavings with no differences at d 42. No differences in ammonia generation or litter pH were observed. Litter moisture was higher for peat moss through d 14. Paws were better in the fresh shaving and peat moss pens than used shaving pens at both d 21 and 42. Next, different depths of used and fresh shavings on footpad dermatitis (FPD) were examined. Trials 1 and 2 compared 2.5, 7.6, and 12.7 cm of fresh shavings or used litter, respectively. In Trial 1, 2.5 cm had higher litter moisture than 7.6 and 12.7 cm at d 21, 28, and 35 (P < 0.05). The 12.7 cm had better paw scores than 2.5 cm at d 21 and 35 (P < 0.05). In Trial 2, 12.7 cm had lower litter moisture than 2.5 cm at d 28, 35, and 42 (P < 0.05). The paws in 12.7 cm were better than those in 2.5 cm at d 35 and 42 (P < 0.05). There was little difference in paw quality and litter moisture between 7.6 and 12.7 cm litter depth in both trials. Peat moss may be an acceptable alternative bedding material and should be evaluated on a commercial scale in areas where it can be obtained economically. These findings suggest that broiler houses should have at least 7.6 cm of litter to control litter moisture levels and reduce FPD.

AB Successful purpose-grown willow production systems require regular monitoring of willow growth to apply timely management techniques for increased productivity and timing of harvest for maximizing profit. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a novel method of estimating above-ground willow biomass, involving measuring light attenuation through the willow canopy, to calculate a 'stem area index' for relating to harvested willow biomass. Two different willow clones, with contrasting growth form, were used: single stem (Charlie) and multi-stem (SV1). Given the strong correlations (r(2) > 0.97; p < 0.05) between the measured stem area index and harvested willow biomass, regardless of growth form, it appears that this simple mensurative technique is a promising alternative for estimating above-ground biomass in short-rotation willow plantations.

AB Precipitation, soil solution and drainage water were collected from a blanket peat catchment at Moor House National Nature Reserve in the Northern Pennine Uplands, UK, an area of moderately high N deposition. Two tributaries of the main stream were also sampled. Between 1993 and 1995 samples were analysed for NH4+ and NO3- and for part of the period for organic N. Inputs of N in precipitation exceeded outputs in stream water. Organic N represented a small proportion of N inputs while inputs of inorganic N averaged 10.2 kg ha(-1) a(-1). Soil solution from 10 cm depth in the peat was dominated by organic N whereas at 50 cm NH4+ slightly exceeded organic N. NO3- was rarely detected at either depth except during a period of exceptionally warm and dry weather in 1995. Output fluxes in stream water of organic N (5.7 to 6.5 kg ha(-1) a(-1)) were much greater than those of inorganic N (0.6 to 2.2 kg ha(-1) a(-1)). Inorganic N in streams was predominantly NO3- except in the smallest stream which had the largest concentrations of NH4+. This suggests that N transformations, particularly nitrification, may be taking place in the mineral soils adjacent to the streams or within the stream channel of the larger catchment.

AB The aim of this work is to assess the usefulness of biowaste deriving from Circular Bioeconomy (CBE) processes (i.e., vermicompost, compost and digestate), as growing substrates for the partial or total replacement of peat, by measuring the vegetation biometric parameters of sage (Salvia officinalisL.)-leaf area; Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) value (index of chlorophyll concentration); fresh and dry weight of leaves; stem weight; root length. The results showed that vermicompost positively influenced most of above parameters (+16.7% for leaf area, +7.3% for fresh leaf weight, +6.4% for dry leaf weight, +8.5% for fresh stem weight, +0.9% for dry stem weight, +16% for root length) and, therefore, can be used as a sustainable growing substrate, alternative to peat, for the sage soilless cultivation. Yet, the results of some biometric parameters are better with peat rather than with compost (-7.2% for SPAD value, -47.3% for fresh leaf weight, -46.8% for dry leaf weight, -32.9% for fresh stem weight, -39.1% for dry stem weight, -52.4% for fresh root weight, -56.6% for dry root weight) and digestate (-30.2% for fresh leaf weight, -33.6% for dry leaf weight, -23.9% for fresh stem weight, -27% for dry stem weight, -51.8% for fresh root weight, -34.4% for dry root weight, -16% for root length). Therefore, these results are interesting for potted plants in nursery activity, while the above differences must be verified also after the transplanting of the tested plants in open field. However, the use of all the above growing substrates alternative to peat allows the sustainable valorization of food industry by-products, plant biomass, animal manure and the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW).

AB In specific conditions even small or very small quantities of wastewater may become threat for areas under special protection. In Poland about 62% of water for drinking purposes is taken from superficial intakes: rivers, lakes and barrage reservoirs (according to data from Polish Main Statistical Office) [6]. Recreation and rest centres are often located in forests, at lakes or other particularly protected reservoirs. Sometimes transportation of sewage with wastewater removal vehicles is impossible. The lack of electric energy lines makes impossible application of classic technological arrangement for wastewater treatment.
   The unfavourable degree of wastewater dilution with receiving waters and necessity of special protection of receiving waters, sometimes forces use of cleaning of outflows on filters suitable for small wastewater treatment plants. Various solutions are given [17, 18]:
   sand filters,
   sand-peat filters,
   peat filters,
   sand filters with the recirculation.
   Change of heavy metals forms of occurrence in sewage sludge is connected with technological processes of wastewater treatment and sewage sludge processing [30].
   Consideration of criteria of usefulness of sewage sludge for natural utilization requires information about conditions of heavy metals release to the environment and the their accessibility for plants [30].
   Immobilization of heavy metals in sewage sludge can be conducted with application of natural silty aluminosilicate minerals, among others: bentonite, clays, kaolinite, ilite, montmorillonite, klinoptylolite and muskowite. Metals heavy adsorbed by silty minerals (e.g. clays, bentonite) create exceptionally durable aluminosilicate connections. Metals in this fraction (V) are inaccessible for alive organisms and permanently excluded from the circulation in the environment.
   Program investigations on application of peat for removal contaminants, especially bacteriological, from wastewater allow to get definite information which may be used in practice [17, 18]. Results obtained during investigations on effectiveness of removal of some kinds of contaminants from wastewater filtered through peat deposit prove, that in wastewater filtered through peat deposit with various depth and with the various intensity of inflow, very high reduction of microbiological contamination is achieved, in many cases 100%.

TI Measurement of Peat Soil Shear Strength Using Wenner Four-Point Probes

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS

ID ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; RESISTIVITY
AB The general objective of this research was to measure the peat soil shear strength using Wenner four-point probes and vane shear strength methods. Specifically, the objective of this study was two-fold, namely, (a) investigating the relationship between laboratory soil resistivity and undrained shear strength and (b) determineing the relationship between in-situ soil resistivity and undrained shear strength. Data were randomly collected over six locations in Meranek, Sarawak, for in-situ test and three repetitions for each data were set based on three parameters. The selected parameters were soil density, moisture content, and salinity for both laboratory and in-situ test using Wenner four-point probes and vane shear method. The soil resistivity and vane shear strength readings for laboratory test were correlated with soil salinity, moisture content, and density. The R-2 values showed a good correlation for soil salinity (R-2 =0.8468) and density (R-2 =0.9475), respectively. However, a weak correlation of R-2 =0.1205 was observed for soil moisture. The R-2 value for in-situ correlation between soil resistivity and three parameters (soil salinity, moisture content, and density) was R-2 =0.8916. It can be concluded that the peat soil shear strengths of the study area using Wenner four-point probes from in-situ were (4.38 ohm.m) and laboratory was (2.47 ohm.m) and when using the vane shear strength method, in-situ was (23 kPA) and laboratory was (5 kPA). This study implies that the peat soil of the study area can be categorized as texture (soft loamy soil) and it is suitable for agriculture instead of construction. The relationship established between Wenner four-point probes and vane shear method can be beneficial for ground engineering design to enhance investigation on site suitability. Future work on DUALEM-421 technique should be emphasised for better subsurface exploration accuracy and resolve peat depth for an in-situ test.

AB This study reports the concentrations of 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from managed burning of moorland vegetation and compares them to PAH in catchment vegetation, underlying peats, head water suspended sediment (HSS), stream water and reservoir sediment cores. Total PAH ranged from 203 to 11,112 mu g/kg in the blanket peats, 101-290 mu g/kg in the fresh moorland vegetation, 4186 mu g/kg at the burnt site, 17,439 mu g/kg in the HSS, 56 ng/L in the stream water and 987 to 7346 mu g/kg in the reservoir sediments. No total or individual PAH concentrations exceeded the published sediment quality guidelines. The perylene content of selected moorland vegetation (sphagnum, heather and bilberry) ranged from 10 to 18% as compared to only 2% for the sediment hosted PAH. A comparison of whole and <250 mu m fractions from the burnt surface layer revealed a near threefold increase in PAH concentration in the fine fraction and a change in the PAH distribution such that naphthalene >> phenanthrene > 2-methylnaphthalene. Elevated total PAH contents were observed close to the blanket peat sediment surface (0-10 cm) and then declined at greater depths. The high PAH content of the HSS was attributed to the high sorption capacity of the organic-rich particles (TOC 25.8% (wt/wt)). The distribution of individual PAH in reservoir cores and HSS was consistent and the results of the principal component analysis and isomeric ratios suggest mainly pyrolytic inputs, from either vegetation burning and coal combustion. A comparison of the reservoir core PAH profiles shows that the source(s) have remained largely unchanged since the reservoir construction in 1929 AD. reflecting consistent moorland management practices.

AB Measurements of the atmospheric concentrations of NO, NO2, total NO(y) and O3 were made on a 12-m tower in a tundra bog ecosystem in southwestern Alaska during the growing season (July-August) of 1988. Typical concentrations of NO(x) and NO(y) were 10-15 pptv, and 130-200 pptv, respectively, lower than at other remote continental sites. Anthropogenic influences were small at this site during this time of year, but significant enhancements in NO(x) and NO(y) concentrations were observed from distant biomass fires. Measurements of NO(x) and O3 Vertical profiles, in combination with eddy correlation measurements of O3 flux (Jacob et al., this issue (b), provide an estimate of the NO(x) emission rate from the surface to the atmosphere, 0.13(+/-O.05) x 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1. Direct (eddy correlation) measurements of the flux of total NO(y) were made for the first time, indicating a downward flux of NO(y) at all times of day, with maximum deposition of 2.5(+/-0.9) x 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1 in the afternoon. Deposition of HNO3 appears to dominate the atmosphere/surface exchange of NO(y). The mean dry deposition rate of NO(y) to the tundra was 1.8(+/-1.0) x 10(9) molecules cm-2 s-1, about half as large as the wet deposition rate of NO3- (Talbot et al., this issue). The impact of wet tundra ecosystems on regional and global atmospheric chemistry is discussed in light of these results.

AB The Bernice coal field, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania, contains anthracite-rank coal in relatively unfolded strata. That setting, along with a misinterpretation of the significance of apparent rank anomalies, led to examples from the Bernice coal field being used in the development of coalification theories in the late 1800's and early 1900's. The evidence available was used to justify both theories of ''thrust pressure'' coalification and rank variation due to original differences in the peat or peat accumulation processes as opposed to thermal metamorphism.

AB The balance between organic matter production and decay determines how fast coastal wetlands accumulate soil organic matter. Despite the importance of soil organic matter accumulation rates in influencing marsh elevation and resistance to sea-level rise, relatively little is known about how decomposition rates will respond to sea-level rise. Here, we estimate the sensitivity of decomposition to flooding by measuring rates of decay in 87 bags filled with milled sedge peat, including soil organic matter, roots and rhizomes. Experiments were located in field-based mesocosms along 3 mesohaline tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Mesocosm elevations were manipulated to influence the duration of tidal inundation. Although we found no significant influence of inundation on decay rate when bags from all study sites were analyzed together, decay rates at two of the sites increased with greater flooding. These findings suggest that flooding may enhance organic matter decay rates even in water-logged soils, but that the overall influence of flooding is minor. Our experiments suggest that sea-level rise will not accelerate rates of peat accumulation by slowing the rate of soil organic matter decay. Consequently, marshes will require enhanced organic matter productivity or mineral sediment deposition to survive accelerating sea-level rise.

AB Novel ecosystem development is occurring within the western boreal forest of Canada due to land reclamation following oil sand surface mining. Sphagnum peat is the primary organic amendment used to reconstruct soil in these novel ecosystems. We hypothesised that ecosystem recovery would be indicated by an increasing similarity in the biomolecular characteristics of novel soil organic matter (SOM) derived from peat to those of natural boreal ecosystems. We evaluated the use of the homologous series of long chain ( >= C-21) n-alkanes with odd/even predominance to monitor the re-establishment of boreal forest on these anthropogenic soils. The lipids were extracted from dominant vegetation inputs and SOM from a series of natural and novel ecosystem reference plots. Twice the concentration of n-alkanes was extracted from natural than from novel ecosystem SOM ( p < 0.01). We observed unique n-alkane signatures for the source vegetation, e. g. peat material was dominated by C-31, and aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) leaves by C-25. The n-alkane distribution differed between the two systems ( p < 0.001) and reflected the dominant vegetation input, i. e. peat or tree species. Our results indicate that further research is required to clarify the influence of vegetation or disturbance on the signature of n-alkanes in SOM; however, the use of n-alkanes as biomarkers of novel ecosystem development is a promising application.

AB This study has been conducted within the "Fonds pour la formation de chercheurs et l'aide la recherche (FCAR)-Action concertee RADARSAT" program. The study shows the potential of RADARSAT-1 standard mode data (S1 and S7 beams) for mapping natural and exploited wetlands in southern Quebec. The best period for the acquisition of SI beam data is during the growing season. However, an S7 beam mode image acquired in February (winter) can help to discriminate different vegetation densities within wetlands. With a maximum likelihood classification method, the data set giving the best results is the winter S7 image and two summer S1 images (May 7 or June 11 and July 28 or August 3). The large wetlands can be easily classified amongst other areas (i.e., agricultural, open water, forest, etc.) by this method and data set, but the different categories of vegetation communities within wetlands cannot be well discriminated. However, the use of a texture parameter (mean, 7 x 7 windows) can significantly improve the classification accuracy. It also permits to distinguish exploited wetlands from natural wetlands and forest areas with an average precision of 89% (for training sites). Furthermore, a neural network classification approach has been adapted to classify radar images for three categories of natural wetlands (i.e., woody wetlands, shrubby wetlands and woody shrubby wetlands). The best classification results (i.e., 86% accuracy) were obtained using a neural network trained by 18 texture channels derived from six RADARSAT-1 images (three S1 and three S7). However, using only two images (one S1 and one S7) gave a similar level of accuracy (84% on test sites and 90% on training sites).

AB The reconstruction of historical trends in atmospheric deposition of contaminant metals by use of their concentration profiles in accumulating, ombrotrophic peat deposits, in conjunction with radionuclide-derived chronologies, is subject to uncertainty because of potential post-depositional mobility both of the radionuclides and of the contaminant metals. Results are presented here for a study of the distribution of Pb-210, Pb, stable Pb isotopes and radiocaesium in the unsaturated, surface zone of ombrotrophic peat deposits in three contrasting locations in Scotland. Pb-210 chronologies are derived and the implied historical variations in atmospheric depositional fluxes and atom ratios of contaminant Pb are considered, along with total inventories, relative to known historical trends in input and proximity to heavily populated, industrial areas. Similarly, radiocaesium concentration profiles, activity ratios and inventories are considered in the context of the Pb-210 chronologies and known inputs. It is concluded that the historical trends in the depositional flux and stable Pb atom ratio of contaminant Pb derived on the basis of the Pb-210 chronologies are in good agreement with known temporal variations in these parameters, consistent with post-depositional immobility of Pb under the conditions investigated here. The study confirms that the high degree of mobility of radiocaesium in organic soils renders it of little value in providing chronological information, but suggests that the presence of small amounts of mineral matter may restrict this mobility.

AB This paper presents evidence for the nature of early and middle Neolithic farming activity, its impact upon the landscape and environment, and its vulnerability to climatic change, at a sub-peat field system at Belderg Beg, North Co. Mayo, Ireland. Pollen analyses of a C-14 dated peat deposit close to the field system indicates that basin peat accumulated from c. 5590 to 5330 cal. BP, probably triggered by farming activities. The palynological evidence indicates that the field system was constructed for pastoral farming, surrounded by woodland. Sediment-stratigraphic analyses show that the soil in the field system was subject to significant erosion, which may have been a causal factor in the local cessation of agriculture in the late sixth millennium cal. BP. Peat humification analyses indicate that surface wetness was greatest at c. 4940 cal. BP, several centuries after abandonment of the field system, coincident in age with evidence for higher precipitation from other sites in North Mayo. Comparison with other records of early and mid-Neolithic agricultural activity and abandonment in the region suggests that the well-recognised mid-Neolithic agricultural decline occurred in the broad context of a shift to a more oceanic climate, but that local factors such as soil quality may have been more important in the exact timing of local agricultural abandonment.

   scarification
AB For the development of vegetation in Kuwait, several ornamental trees and shrubs are being introduced and evaluated for their suitability under its harsh environmental conditions. Caper (Capparis spinosa L.) is a multipurpose crop native to Mediterranean area, known for its drought- and salinity tolerance and its ability to conserve soil moisture. Poor seed germination due to physical and physiological dormancy is a major limitation for its large scale cultivation. A study was carried out to investigate the effects of acid scarification followed by a combination of seed treatments including 0.04% gibberellic acid (GA(3)), one, two or three weeks chilling or warm water treatment with one, two or three months chilling on germination of dry caper seeds that were sown either in Petri dishes or directly in the potting medium. The results showed that scarification with 1% H2SO4 for 20 min followed by 0.04% GA(3) and one week chilling at 4 degrees C was the most effective in breaking dormancy of dry caper seeds and resulted in 64% germination in commercial substratum (SAB Potting Soil-Plantaflor) containing a nixture of slightly decomposed peat (white peat) and more strongly decomposed peat (frozen black peat) with organic mather less than 95% and nutrients like nitrogen (100-300 mg l(-1)), phosphate (100-300 mg l(-1)), and potassium (100-400 mg l(-1)) as compared to warm water treatment with three months chilling, which gave 42% germination.

AB The end of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA) ushered in a period of significant change in Earth's carbon cycle, demonstrated by the widespread occurrence of coals worldwide. In this study, we present stratigraphically constrained organic stable carbon isotope (delta C-13(org)) data for Early Permian coals (312 vitrain samples) from the Moatize Basin, Mozambique, which record the transition from global icehouse to greenhouse conditions. These coals exhibit a three-stage evolution in atmospheric delta C-13 from the Artinskian to the Kungurian. Early Kungurian coals effectively record the presence of the short-lived Kungurian Carbon Isotopic Excursion (KCIE), associated with the proposed rapid release of methane clathrates during deglaciation at the terminus of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA), with no observed disruption to peat-forming and terrestrial plant communities. delta C-13(org) variations in coals from the Moatize Basin are cyclic in nature on the order of 10(3)-10(5) years and reflect changes in delta C-13(org) of similar to +/- 1% during periods of stable peat accumulation, supporting observations from Palaeozoic coals elsewhere. These cyclic variations express palaeoenvironmental factors constraining peat growth and deposition, associated with changes in base level. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness of vitrain in coal as a geochemical tool for recording global atmospheric change during the Late Palaeozoic.

AB At Pedregal, more than 40 m of sediments are exposed within a 'fan complex' formed between lateral moraines of the adjacent Mucuchache and El Caballo valleys. Early and late Merida (Wisconsinan) glaciations are represented by till and till plus proglacial sediments, respectively. A middle Wisconsinan interstadial event, here termed the Pedregal interstade, began at the end of the Early Merida glaciation at approximately 60 ka BP. Following the retreat of ice from the small Pedregal Basin, a lake formed when the local drainage was blocked due to movement of the Mesa de Caballo along the Bocono Fault. Shallow lake or no-lake phases lasted approximately a few hundred to, at most, 2000 years, and each lake phase was marked by peat accumulation. Four of seven peats identified formed during sufficiently long intervals for soil profiles (incipient to mature Spodosols) also to develop. The Spodosol with the strongest development (Eb/Bsb/Coxb/Cub horizons) is found adjacent to the lowest peat and reflects ongoing early Merida stadial (MIS 3) conditions; the youngest peats, associated with weak podzolic soils (Eb/Bsb horizons), formed under slightly warmer interstadial conditions, presumably with less soil water. Cyclic lacustrine deposition is related to lake level and relative depth fluctuations, due in part to variable shoreline/delta progradation and shallowing as the lake deepened in general. Whereas final drainage of the lake is related to movement of the Bocono Fault and breach of the moraines that form the Mesa de Caballo, earlier lake level fluctuations appear related to climate change. Radiocarbon dating of the peats suggests they are related to warmer periods and may tentatively correlate with small 'interstadials' or 'D-O events' detected in the oxygen-isotope record of Greenland ice cores and North Atlantic marine sediments.

AB Ecosystem reconstruction after mining disturbance is a challenge considering the multitude of factors that affect soil formation and revegetation. In the boreal forest of western Canada, peat material is often used as the organic amendment for land reclamation to upland forest. Carbon and water dynamics of peat-dominated ecosystems differ from natural upland forest soils. The objective of this work was to evaluate the evolution of soils reconstructed after mining disturbance using C-13 and H-2 analyses of n-alkane tracers. Ten soils from natural ecosystems were sampled (0-10 cm) and compared with 11 soils from novel ecosystems ranging in age from 0 to 30 yr, as well as a fresh peat sample. Soils supported different vegetation, including pine (Pinus spp.), aspen (Populus spp.), and white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss]. Despite overlaps for some individual n-alkanes, we found a dominance of n-C-25 in reconstructed soils, also dominant in the peat material, and a dominance of n-C-27 in natural soils, one of the dominant n-alkanes in natural forest vegetation. In addition, there was a significant difference in odd n-alkane delta H-2 and delta C-13 values between natural and reconstructed soils (p < .05). Differences in <delta>H-2 values, more negative for reconstructed soils than for natural soils, were attributed to changes in soil moisture, from wetter peat-dominated soils to drier upland forests; among forest types, delta H-2 values were most negative under pine vegetation. The delta C-13 composition of odd n-alkanes, in particular n-C-27, was significantly related to tree age (p < .05). Overall, both H-2 and C-13 isotopic signatures of odd n-alkanes exhibited differences between natural and reconstructed soils. However, within the reconstructed soils, neither isotopic signature showed a clear evolution with age since reclamation.

AB Numerous differences in the petrography and organic geochemistry of two Tertiary, low rank coal deposits of Bulgaria, formed within comparable depositional environments, are outlined. Different floral assemblages are indicated as the main sources of organic matter. For the Eocene Bourgas sub-bituminous coals a warm climate plant community dominated by angiosperms is reflected in the biomarker composition, whereas a coniferous flora was the main source of the resinous organic matter of the Miocene Maritza-East lignite. The results are in agreement with palaeobotanical data. These differences in the peat forming vegetation of the Paleogene compared to the Neogene of Bulgaria are attributed to decreasing temperature during the Tertiary. The abundance of resinous compounds relative to lipids from plant waxes (long chain n-alkanes), as well as the preservation of plant tissue, are mainly controlled by gymnosperm/angiosperm ratios. Pristane/phytane and diasterenes/sterenes ratios reflect variations in redox conditions and the pH of the depositional environments, caused by eustatic sea level changes, freshwater inflow, or varying (ground)water table. Changing Eh and pH values are associated with differences in microbial activity controlling the extent of gelification of plant tissue. Bacteria most probably contributed to the aromatisation of triterpenoids in the mire. Enhanced thermal maturation of organic matter during diagenesis is reflected in higher contents of n-alkanes and the presence of alkyl naphthalenes in the Bourgas coals. Alkyl naphthalenes are thought to have been formed from pentacyclic triterpenoids rather than from resinous compounds. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The bioavailability of an organic compound in a soil or sediment commonly declines with the soil-chemical contact time (aging). A series of parallel desorption and bioavailability experiments was carried out on phenanthrene previously aged up to similar to 100 d in Mount Pleasant silt loam (Mt. Pleasant, NY, USA) or Pahokee peat soil to determine as a function of the aging period the degree of correlation between the reduction in bioavailability and the rate and extent of desorption and the influence of soil organic matter composition on availability. The mineralization of phenanthrene by two bacteria and the uptake of phenanthrene by earthworms showed expected declines with aging. Likewise, the rate of phenanthrene desorption in the absence of organisms decreased with aging. The decline in initial rate of mineralization or desorption was nearly an order bf magnitude after 50 to 60 d of aging. Plots of normalized rates of mineralization or desorption practically coincided. Similarly plots of normalized fraction mineralized or fraction desorbed during an arbitrary period gave comparable slopes. The partial removal of organic matter from the peat by extraction with dilute NaOH to leave the humin fraction reduced the biodegradation of phenanthrene aged for 38 and 63 d as compared to the nonextracted peat,but the effect disappeared at longer incubation times. The rate of desorption from samples of peat previously extracted with NaOH or Na4P2O7 declined with aging and, for a given aging period, was significantly slower than from nonextracted peat. This work shows that the reduction in bioavailability of phenanthrene over time in soil is directly correlated with reduction of its physical availability due to desorption limitations. In addition, this study shows that removal of extractable humic substances leads to a decline in the rate of desorption and, in the bioavailability of the substrate.

AB Effects of depression depth (Z(T)), lake surface elevation (E-S), catchment area:lake surface area (A(T):A(O)), trophic status, and surficial geology on sediment burial rates in small Western Boreal Plain lakes were assessed using content and chronology of cores from a relatively large and small lake on each of moraine (M), glaciofluvial (GF), and glaciolacustrine (GL) deposits. Aquatic and terrestrial plant and sediment carbon:nitrogen (C:N) suggested most buried C was aquatic. The rate of long-term total C burial averaged 31 g(.)m(-2). year(-1) (range: 0-84 g(.)m(-2) (.) year(-1)); this was recently 79 g(.)m(-2). year(-1) (range: 40-180 g(.)m(-2.)year(-1)) (higher and more variable rates than previously reported for Boreal lakes). Long-term C accrual rate and sediment depth increased with increasing Z(T). In each landform, a relatively low base elevation (EB = E-S - Z(T)) lake began accumulating sediment thousands of years before a high EB lake. GF depressions were deeper and had accrued more C(.)m(-2) (and infilled) faster than M and GL lakes; a large GF lake had no organic sediment, perhaps because of large groundwater inputs. Increasing A(T):A(O) corresponded with increasing C accrual rates where precipitation and evaporation dominated (surface runoff infrequent) (M and GL) but not where groundwater dominated (GF lakes) lake water budgets, illustrating the importance of landform and depression characteristics in regionalizing lake-C burial estimates.

These forests often have large stores of soil organic carbon. Recent increases in temperature at northern latitudes may be stimulating decomposition rates of this soil carbon. It is unclear, however, how changes in environmental conditions influence decomposition in these systems, and if substrate controls of decomposition vary with hydrologic and thermal regime. We addressed these issues by investigating the effects of temperature, moisture, and organic matter chemical characteristics on decomposition of fibric soil horizons from three black spruce forest sites. The sites varied in drainage and permafrost, and included a "Well Drained" site where permafrost was absent, and "Moderately well Drained" and "Poorly Drained" sites where permafrost was present at about 0.5 m depth. Samples collected from each site were incubated at five different moisture contents (2, 25, 50, 75, and 100% saturation) and two different temperatures (10 degrees C and 20 degrees C) in a full factorial design for two months. Organic matter chemistry was analyzed using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry prior to incubation, and after incubation on soils held at 20 degrees C, 50% saturation. Mean cumulative mineralization, normalized to initial carbon content, ranged from 0.2% to 4.7%, and was dependent on temperature, moisture, and site. The effect of temperature on mineralization was significantly influenced by moisture content, as mineralization was greatest at 20 degrees C and 50-75% saturation. While the relative effects of temperature and moisture were similar for all soils, mineralization rates were significantly greater for samples from the "Well Drained" site compared to the other sites. Variations in the relative abundances of polysaccharide-derivatives and compounds of undetermined source (such as toluene, phenol, 4-methyl phenol, and several unidentifiable compounds) could account for approximately 44% of the variation in mineralization across all sites under ideal temperature and moisture conditions. Based on our results, changes in temperature and moisture likely have similar, additive effects on in situ soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition across a wide range of black spruce forest systems, while variations in SOM chemistry can lead to significant differences in decomposition rates within and among forest sites.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effect of N fertilization on the soil CH, flux during the growing season of onion in a structured clay soil with stagnant water at depths of 70-80 cut and with a peat-mixed subsoil. The following 4 treatments were analyzed over a period of two years: T1) fertilized, onion growing, T2) fertilized, bare field, T3) unfertilized, onion growing, and T4) unfertilized, bare field. In the fertilized T1 and T2 treatments, fertilizers (mixture of 3: 1 NH4NO3 : (NH4)(2)SO4) at rates of 322 kg N ha(-1) in 1999 and 242 kg N ha-1 in 2000 were applied as basal fertilizers before onion was transplanted. CH4 fluxes among the treatments ranged from -0.06 to 0.12 mg CH4-Cm(-2)h(-1) in 1999, and from -0.03 to 0.01 mg CH4-C m(-2) h(-1) in 2000, which were high after heavy rain in summer. Cumulative CH4 flux from May to November in the fertilized T1 and T2 treatments was 59 mg CH4C M-2 for both treatments in 1999, and 3.2 and -0.9 mg CH4-C m(-2) in 2000, respectively. On the other hand, in the unfertilized T3 and T-4 treatments, the cumulative CH4 flux was 0.2 and -9.2 mg CH4-C m(-2) in 1999, and -26 and -20 mg CH4-C m(-2) in 2000, respectively. Although the cumulative CH4 flux in each treatment was higher in 1999 than in 2000, the fertilized treatments in both years showed a significantly higher cumulative CH4 flux than the unfertilized treatments. This might be ascribed to the higher level of nitrification in the fertilized treatments, because a high nitrate concentration was observed in the fertilized treatments in the onion growing season. The results also revealed that onion growing did not exert a significant influence on the CH4 flux. The precipitation from May to November was 642 nun in 1999 and 1,008 mm. in 2000, and the CH4 emission increased when the precipitation was low. In addition, the CH4 concentration in the soil profile increased with the increase of the depth in summer as the soil was dry. These findings indicated that CH4 diffusion from the soil to the atmosphere was inhibited by rainwater.

ID NUTRIENT SOLUTION STRENGTH
AB Changes in the pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and concentrations of essential nutrients have to be analyzed to enable reuse of the drainage solution (DS) in closed hydroponic cultivation of a crop because the chemical characteristics (CC) of drainage vary in relation to the kind of crop grown and the root media used. The objective of this research was to investigate changes in the CC of DS during cultivation of 'Seolhyang' strawberries. The root medium is composed of coir dust, peat moss, and perlite in the ratio 6:2:2 (v/v/v), and the composition of the nutrient solution applied for crop cultivation is N, P, K, Ca, and Mg at 15, 5, 7, 6, and 2 mg.L-1, respectively. The changes in the CC of the DS as well as the growth, yield, and fruit quality were investigated in relation to the number of years the root media used. The pH of the DS decreased as the number of years of root medium usage increased. The ECs of DS in all treatments were in the range of 0.8 to 1.5 dS.m(-1) during the growing season and tended to rise as the number of years of usage in the root medium increased. The concentrations of NO3 and Ca in the DS ranged from 200 to 600 mg.L-1 and 52 to 176 mg.L-1, respectively. The K concentration in the DS was in the range of 104 to 221 mg kg(-1) in all treatments during the growing season. The concentrations of P and Mg in the DS were 15 to 60 mg.L-1 and 18 to 48 mg.L-1, respectively. As the number of years of root media usage increased, the concentrations of NO3, P, Ca, and Mg tended to rise, whereas that of K tended to decrease. The different treatments with varying number of years of root medium usage did not lead to significant differences in plant growth, tissue nutrient content, budding and flowering date, and total yield. The results from this research, the changes in nutrient composition of the DS and their effect on tissue nutrient content, can be used to modify the nutrient composition in the DS when the solution is reused in closed hydroponic cultivation of 'Seolhyang' strawberries.

AB Water draining from the Everglades marshes of southern Florida contains high concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC), N (DON), and in some locations, P (DOP). These dissolved organic nutrients carry over 90% of the N and organic C, and about 25% of the P exported downstream in the Everglades. Our objectives were to describe the most important aspects of the origin and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Everglades, and to describe the processes controlling its concentration and export. Concentrations of dissolved organic nutrients are influenced by local plant production, decomposition, and sorption equilibrium with peat. The drained peat soils of the Everglades Agricultural Area and the more productive marshes of the northern Everglades produce some of the highest concentrations of DOC and DON in the Everglades watershed. In portions of the marshes of the northern Everglades, P enrichment was correlated with higher local DOC and DON concentrations and greater production of soluble plant matter. Microbial degradation of Everglades DOM was very slow; less than 10% of the DOC was lost after 6 months of incubation in the laboratory and supplements of inorganic nutrients failed to speed the decomposition. Exposure to solar radiation increased the subsequent decay rate of the remaining DOC (25% in 6 mo.). Solar radiation alone mineralized 20.5% of the DOC, 7% of the DON, and degraded about 50% of the humic substances over 21 days in sterile porewater samples and thus degraded DOM faster than microbial degradation. The humic substances appeared to inhibit biodegradation of the other fractions of the DOC since hydrophilic organic acids decomposed faster when isolated from the humic substances. The fate of DOC and DON is closely linked as indicated by a generally narrow range of C/N ratios. In contrast, high concentrations of DOP were associated with P enrichment (at least in pore water). The DOC was composed of about 50% humic substances, 33% hydrophilic acids, and 15% hydrophilic neutral substances, typical of DOC from other environments, despite the fact that it originates from a neutral to slightly alkaline peatland. Despite high exports of DON (3.9 g m(-2) y(-1) from one area), the marshes of the northern Everglades are a sink for DON on a landscape scale. The agricultural fields of the Everglades Agricultural Area, however, exported net quantities of DON. High concentrations of DOC desorbed from the agricultural soils when water with no DOC was added. Sorption experiments indicated that high concentrations of dissolved organic matter flowing into the marshes from the Everglades Agricultural Area could suppress the further desorption of additional soluble organic matter through physicochemical mechanisms. While biological factors, plant production and microbial decomposition are important in producing potentially soluble organic nutrients, physicochemical sorption equilibria, hydrology, and degradation by solar radiation are also likely to control the export of this material on the landscape scale.

AB The Amstel river is located in the peat-covered coastal plain of the Netherlands and gives Amsterdam its name (Amstel dam). It is a small secondary branch of the repeatedly bifurcating Rhine delta system. Historically, the Amstel debouched into the peat-fringed former Oer-IJ estuary, which was connected to the North Sea, but after the closure of this inlet the estuary was transformed into an inland sea (IJ) due to erosion of the adjacent peat. The Amstel river was active between 3000 BP and 1122 AD after which time the supply water from the Rhine was stopped due to the construction of a dam far upstream near Wijk bij Duurstede. On the basis of borehole data from various sources, four cross-sections were constructed in the Amstel branch to study the unknown lithology and lithostratigraphy of the Amstel sediments in the Amsterdam area. The deposits show the Amstel was a low-energy river which carried mainly clay. The cross-sections reveal that the Amstel in its downstream part was flanked by two lithologically identical layers of overbank clay, intercalated by a peat layer. The lowermost overbank clay was deposited from 3000 BP to about 1000 AD. The intercalated peat layer is estimated to have developed between the 11th and 12th centuries AD, indicating a decreased sediment supply in the Amstel, and rise of water level in the downstream river caused by Zuiderzee influences such as storms and tide. The uppermost overbank clay was deposited during major storm surges such as those documented in 1164 and 1170 AD, and was derived from the brackish Zuiderzee; it has been traced upstream along the Amstel for over 10 km. Near the mouth of the Amstel channel in the Oer-IJ estuary its bottom has been scoured by estuarine processes to a lower level. On the basis of archaeological and geological data it is argued that the Amstel channel of medieval Amsterdam had a water depth of about 6 m before the construction of a dam in the 13th century. Soil scientists, historical geographers and historians have argued that the Amstel once consisted of two separate rivers: a northern Oer-IJ connected channel draining from the Amsterdam Stopera to the north, and a southern peat draining channel draining from the Amsterdam-Watergraafsmeer to the south. The relatively straight stretch of the present-day Amstel now positioned within the urban area has been hypothesised to be man-made between the 11th and 13th centuries AD. In this paper, on the basis of geological arguments such as channel depths, overbank clays, peat composition and other characteristics, it is concluded that the Amstel had a natural channel in the Amsterdam area.

AB The first stage of tempering of an iron-carbon-nitrogen martensite (containing 1.7 at.% C and 3.3 at.% N) was studied by atom probe analysis. Different stages of transformation were obtained by subjecting various specimens to different heat treatments. Analysis of the mass spectra revealed the presence of peaks not observed on decomposing binary FeC and FeN martensites: molecular ions occurred that contained both carbon and nitrogen. Upon tempering the FeCN martensitic specimens, interstitial-enriched regions develop. In most of these regions one type of interstitial is predominantly present but a small amount of the other type is present too. In combination with previously obtained X-ray diffraction results it was concluded that two types of transition precipitates are formed: nitrogen-rich regions also containing carbon and identified as alpha ''-like precipitates (alpha '' is the transition precipitate formed in binary FeN martensite), and carbon-rich regions also containing nitrogen and identified as epsilon/eta-like precipitates (epsilon/eta is the transition precipitate formed in binary FeC martensite).

AB Anaerobic carbon mineralization is a major regulator of soil methane production, but the relationship between these processes is variable. To explain the dynamics of this relationship a model was developed, which comprises the dynamics of alternative electron-accepters, of acetate and of methanogenic biomass. Major assumptions are: (i) alternative electron-accepters suppress methanogenesis and (ii) the rate of electron-acceptor reduction is controlled by anaerobic carbon mineralization. The model was applied to anaerobic incubation experiments with slurried soil samples from a drained and an undrained peat soil in the Netherlands to test the model and to further interpret the data. Three parameters were fitted with a Monte Carlo method, using experimentally determined time series of methane, carbon dioxide and acetate. The fitted parameters were the initial concentration of electron-acceptors, the initial concentration of methanogenic biomass and the maximum relative growth rate of methanogenic biomass. Simulated and measured time courses of methane corresponded reasonably well. The model as such stresses the importance of alternative electron-accepters. At the drained site initial alternative electron-acceptor concentrations were between 0.3 and 0.8 mol electron equivalents (el. eqv.) kg(-1) dw soil, whereas at the undrained site they were between 0.0 and 0.3 mol el. eqv. kg(-1) dw sail, depending on the experimental treatments. The sum of measured NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-) concentrations and estimated maximum Fe(3)(+) and Mn(4+) concentrations was much lower than the fitted concentrations of alternative electron-accepters. Apparently, reduction of unknown electron-accepters consumed a large part of anaerobically-mineralized carbon which, therefore, was not available for methanogenesis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra at the sulfur (S) K-edge (E = 2472 eV) were compared for bulk soil material, humic and fulvic acid fractions, and different particle size separates from Ah horizons of two arable Luvisols, from an O and a Bs horizon of a Podzol under Norway spruce forest, and from an H horizon of a Histosol (peat bog). In the bulk soil samples, the contribution of reduced organic S (organic mono- and disulfides) to total sulfur increased from 27% to 52%, and the contribution of ester sulfate and 4 S decreased from 39% to 14% of total S in the following order: arable Luvisols Ah-forested Podzol O-Histosol H. This sequence reflects the increasing organic carbon content and the decreasing O(2) availability in that order. Neither sulfonate nor inorganic sulfide was detected in any of the bulk soil samples. For all samples except the Podzol Bs, the XANES spectra of the bulk soils differed considerably from the spectra of the humic and acid fractions of the respective soils, with the latter containing less reduced S (16-44% of total S) and more oxidized S (sulfone S: 19-35%; ester sulfate S: 14-38% of total S). Also the S speciation of most particle size fractions extracted from the Ah horizon of the Viehhausen Luvisol and the Bs horizon of the Podzol was different from that of the bulk soil. For both soils, the contribution of oxidized S species to total S increased and the contribution of sulfoxides and organic mono- and disulfides decreased with decreasing particle size. Thus, sulfur K-edge XANES spectra of alkaline soil extracts, including humic and fulvic acids or of particle size separates are not representative for the S speciation of the original soil sample they are derived from. The differences can be attributed to (i) artificial changes of the sulfur speciation during alkaline extraction (conversion of reduced S into oxidized S, loss of SO(4)(2-) during purification of the extracts by dialysis) or particle size separation (carry-over of water-soluble S, such as 4 SO(4)(2-)), but also to (ii) preferential enrichment of oxidized S in hydrophilic water-soluble soil organic matter (ester sulfate) and in the clay fraction of soils (ester sulfate, adsorbed 4 (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Mullins Coal lies within the braided-fluvial South Bar Formation. The lateral extent (15 km) and thickness (2 m) of the coal suggest that controls for peat accumulation were allogenic. Marine inundation of the distal braidplain, as indicated by the high-sulphur content of the coal and the occurrence of agglutinated foraminifera in associated shales, caused ponding of freshwater near maximum marine transgression, with accumulation of thick paralic peat across a stable platform of sandy fluvial sediments. Highstand parasequences with thin capping coals were subsequently incised beneath a sequence boundary as the braidplain readvanced. The Mullins Coal thins and splits in association with muddy bayfill deposits eastward towards the Glace Bay Syncline, a long-lived palaeotopographic element related to fault-bounded basement blocks. Although relative sea-level change controlled the stratigraphic position of the precursor peats, differential tectonic subsidence and/or compaction modified their extent, thickness and quality.

AB This paper characterizes a seasonally inundated Danish floodplain wetland in a state close to naturalness and includes an analysis of the major controls on the wetland water and nitrogen balances.
   The main inputs of water are precipitation and percolation during ponding and unsaturated conditions. Lateral saturated subsurface flow is low. The studied floodplain owes its wetland status to the hydraulic properties of its sediments: the low hydraulic conductivity of a silt-clay deposit on top of the floodplain maintains ponded water during winter, and parts of autumn and spring. A capillary fringe extends to the soil surface, and capillary rise from groundwater during summer maintains near-saturated conditions in the root zone, and allows a permanently very high evapotranspiration rate. The average for the growing season of 1999 is 3(.)6 mm day(-1) and peak rate is 5(.)6 mm day(-1). In summer, the evapotranspiration is to a large degree supplied by subsurface storage in a confined peat layer underlying the silt-clay.
   The floodplain sediments are in a very reduced state as indicated by low sulphate concentrations. All nitrate transported into the wetland is thus denitrified. However, owing to modest water exchange with surrounding groundwater and surface water, denitrification is low; 71 kg NO3-N ha(-1) during the study period of 1999. Reduction of nitrate diffusing into the sediments during water ponding accounts for 75% of nitrate removal. Biomass production and nitrogen uptake in above-ground vegetation is high-8(.)56 t dry matter ha(-1) year(-1) and 103 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Subsurface ammonium concentrations are high, and convective upward transport into the root zone driven by evapotranspiration amounted to 12(.)8 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). The floodplain wetland sediments have a high nitrogen content, and conditions are very favourable for mineralization. Mineralization thus constitutes 72% of above-ground plant uptake.
   The study demonstrates the necessity of identifying controlling factors, and to combine surface flow with vadose and groundwater flow processes in order to fully comprehend the flow and nitrogen dynamics of this type of wetland. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The paper presents the results of studying the Pesochansk brown coal deposit located in the central Dnieper-Donets coal-bearing area. The sedimentary cover of this area is characterized by the presence of salt structures, one of which is the Pesochansk stock. The subsidence trough of this pre-Paleogene structure was filled with the Paleogene-Neogene sediments containing three brown coal seams with different lithopetrographic compositions. This diversity was related to instability of the tectonic regime, changes in the paleogeographic condition and climate, as well as variability of the primary plant material and its transformation rate. It is shown that peat was accumulated during the formation of Lower and Middle coal seams in the coastal-marine lowland with a high degree of inundation, resulting in the formation of predominantly gelite-type coals. During the formation of the Upper coal seam, peat was accumulated mainly in the lacustrine-marsh environment with the predominant formation of gelitites.

AB Peat-swamp vegetation of the late Middle Pennsylvanian differed markedly from that of the Late Pennsylvanian. Dominating the former was a variety of arborescent lycopsids, medullosan pteridosperms, and increasing numbers of marattialean tree ferns. In contrast, marattialean tree ferns and medullosan pteridosperms were dominant in the Late Pennsylvanian whereas lycopsids were of lesser importance, although much species turnover occurred in each of these groups. The most severe turnover was among the lycopsids; the Sigillariaceac were the only major lycopsid lineage to survive, thrive, and attain wide distribution throughout Euramerica, represented almost exclusively by Sigillaria brardii Brongniart (possibly a species complex). The nature of the ecological transition that brought the marattialean vegetation to dominance is not well understood, even though the pattern has been documented across Euramerica. In a study of terminal peat-swamp vegetation preserved at the coal-bed to roof-shale transition in three major late Middle Pennsylvanian age coals of the Illinois Basin, USA, we have identified two major plant assemblages. The first, preserved at the coal-to-roof transitional interface, is autochthonous to minimally parautochthonous and appears to have been buried rapidly during the introduction of sediment to the swamp habitat, burying the vegetation close to its site of growth. This vegetation is similar in taxonomic composition to that documented from the peat swamp (based on coal balls), although the quantitative abundances of the dominant species are different from most coal-ball assemblages. In contrast, the second major plant assemblage occurs in tidal channels that traversed actively developing mudflats flanking major estuaries on the lowland landscape. These channels primarily contain the arborescent lycopsid Sigillaria Brongniart with scattered remains of marattialean tree fern and pteridosperm foliage. This second assemblage more closely resembles the peat-swamp flora of the Late Pennsylvanian than that of the Middle Pennsylvanian and may presage this younger flora. The pattern suggests that following the ecological disruption during the Middle-Late Pennsylvanian transition, vegetation formerly dominant in Middle Pennsylvanian clastic-swamp habitats colonized the Late Pennsylvanian peat swamps and surrounding swampy lowlands. This clastic-swamp vegetation thus appears to have harbored lineages (even if not individual species) that survived the turnover and were then able to move into the disrupted landscape from which the formerly dominant forms had been removed.

AB Acridine orange (AO), dinitrobenzoic acid (DNB), bromocresol green (BCG), bromophenol blue (BPB), and methylene blue (MB) were chosen as model aromatic compounds of different polarity, charge, and solubility in water to examine the-effects of solute properties on hydrophobic adsorption. These compounds show strict structural similarities to some herbicides and other potential xenobiotic pollutants and exhibit distinct absorption maxima in the visible region, which allows for their easy determination. A well-decomposed peat (medisaprist) at four different stages of drying was used to determine compound adsorption/desorption influences based on the degree of hydrophobicity and charge density of an organic surface. Adsorption and desorption isotherms were investigated using the batch equilibration method and determining the concentration of free chemicals by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. AO had a high tendency of adsorption and was strongly sorbed on peat samples that had been air-dried for 12 months. The lower Freundlich coefficient values found for MB when compared with AO at all the drying stages of the peat indicated that electrostatic attraction has a secondary contribution to sorption. On the contrary the higher energy that must be spent to break solute-solvent interactions in the case of charged or polar molecules is one of the main factors in determining the position of the equilibrium. Fora given solute, K-f values varied with the degree of hydrophobicity and the charge density of the surface, but again solute-solvent interactions appear to be much more important in the overall energy balance of hydrophobic pollutants than the electrostatic sorbate-sorbent interactions. A change in the solution pH does not improve the adsorption of the relatively polar DNB molecule, but sorption increases strongly for BCG and BPB when these molecules are in non-dissociated farms. The larger increase in BPB sorption observed on H+ saturated peat suggests that the degree of interaction increases with the suppression of the negative charge, but charge repulsion has a small effect in preventing adsorption of molecules bearing hydrophobic groups such as BCG. Desorption results differed depending on the chemical structure of the compound examined. For example, with AO there was no desorption from the more hydrophobic peat surfaces. A negative hysteresis was observed for DNB; the magnitude of hysteresis, evaluated using the ratio of Freundlich coefficients for adsorption and desorption, increased with the drying stage of the sorbent and was larger on oven-dried samples.

AB The vegetation and land cover structure of tundra areas is fragmented when compared to other biomes. Thus, satellite images of high resolution are required for producing land cover classifications, in order to reveal the actual distribution of land cover types across these large and remote areas. We produced and compared different land cover classifications using three satellite images (QuickBird, Aster and Landsat TM5) with different pixel sizes (2.4m, 15 m and 30m pixel size, respectively). The study area, in northeastern European Russia, was visited in July 2007 to obtain ground reference data. The QuickBird image was classified using supervised segmentation techniques, while the Aster and Landsat TM5 images were classified using a pixel-based supervised classification method. The QuickBird classification showed the highest accuracy when tested against field data, while the Aster image was generally more problematic to classify than the Landsat TM5 image. Use of smaller pixel sized images distinguished much greater levels of landscape fragmentation. The overall mean patch sizes in the QuickBird, Aster, and Landsat TM5-classifications were 871 m(2), 2141 m(2) and 7433 m(2), respectively. In the QuickBird classification, the mean patch size of all the tundra and peatland vegetation classes was smaller than one pixel of the Landsat TM5 image. Water bodies and fens in particular occur in the landscape in small or elongated patches, and thus cannot be realistically classified from larger pixel sized images. Land cover patterns vary considerably at such a fine-scale, so that a lot of information is lost if only medium resolution satellite images are used. It is crucial to know the amount and spatial distribution of different vegetation types in arctic landscapes, as carbon dynamics and other climate related physical, geological and biological processes are known to vary greatly between vegetation types.

AB Grasslands are one of the major biomes on earth and can serve as important soil carbon sinks. Nutrient enrichment of these grasslands can have a significant impact on carbon losses through the decomposition process. We investigated the effects of long-term (12-yr) experimentally increased N and/or P supply on litter production and on the chemistry and decomposition of bulk litter from two grasslands differing in soil nutrient status.
   Potential aboveground litter production in the controls of a P-rich low-productivity riparian grassland was lower than that in a N-rich high-productivity peat grassland and increased with enhanced N supply. Nutrient treatments did not enhance litter production in the high-productivity peat grassland. The concentrations of phenolics in bulk litter from the peat grassland, dominated by sedges, were 2-3 times higher than those in the riparian grassland that was dominated by herbs and grasses. At both sites increased nutrient supply had no detectable effect on phenolics concentrations. All P-related litter chemistry parameters reflected the higher soil P status of the riparian grassland. P fertilization had a greater effect on litter chemistry in the P-deficient peat grassland than in the P-rich riparian grassland. At both sites, there was no change in overall litter chemistry in response to N fertilization, except for higher lignin concentrations in the peat grassland litter. Both short-term (8 wk) litter incubations in the laboratory and a 3-yr litter bag study in the field showed that riparian grassland litter decomposed faster than litter from the peat grassland. The long-term nutrient additions had no significant effects on the decomposition of the bulk litter of each grassland type. Regression analysis on the combined data of the two sites showed that phenolics, and to a lesser extent, P-related litter chemistry parameters, exerted a strong control on both litter respiration and litter mass loss.
   Our study shows that long-term experimental nutrient additions do not lead to increased decomposition rates in grasslands and that the initial plant community litter quality is the main determinant of carbon losses through the decomposition process. The results of this study suggest that nutrient enrichment will likely affect ecosystem carbon balance more by affecting litter production than by affecting litter decomposition rates.

AB Wetlands are an important natural source of methane to the atmosphere. The amounts of methane emitted from inundated ecosystems in the United States can vary greatly from area to area. Seasonal temperature, water table dynamics, and carbon content of soils are principal controlling factors. To calculate the effect of wetlands (and their potential conversion to other land uses) on global greenhouse gas emissions, information on area covered by various wetland types is needed, along with verified projections of spatial variation in net methane emissions. Both of these variables are poorly known, and estimates are largely unavailable at the country level. Nationwide satellite datasets for the coterminous United States (excluding Alaska) have been combined with ecosystem model predictions of monthly net carbon exchange with the atmosphere to produce the first detailed mapping of methane fluxes from natural wetlands on a monthly and annual basis. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model's predicted mean emission flux of methane from wetlands of the continental United States totaled 5.5 Tg CH4 per year. Ranked in terms of total annual flux, the 10 states with the highest predicted emissions (not considering Alaska) are all located in the Great Lakes region and the southern coastal regions of the country.

AB We report here the first findings of testate amoebae at high southern latitudes (54 degrees S) from four gravity cores recovered in the Lago Fagnano (Tierra del Fuego, Argentina), where twelve taxa have been recognized. Among them, Centropyxis constricta "constricta", Centropyxis elongata, Difflugia globulus, Diffiugia oblonga "oblonga", and Difflugia protaeiformis "amphoralis" are always present, while other taxa are randomly distributed. According to the sand/silt ratio in the different cores, the Total Organic Carbon content and the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio, as well as the presence/disappearance and abundance of testate amoebae from cluster analysis, we infer a correlation between major textural/granulometrical changes found in the cores and environmental changes. A seismic event occurred on 1949, which substantially modified the morphology of the eastern Lago Fagnano shoreline and the supply pattern from two main eastern tributaries of the lake, is recorded in the studied cores. This event has in part modified the distribution of testate amoebae taxa within the studied cores. Present results show that testate amoebae represent important indicators to detect changes occurring in the environment in which they live. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The precise measurement of the water retention and shrink/swell properties of growing media or soil over time is important for the effective management of irrigation and fertilization. A new apparatus was developed for simultaneously and continuously measuring the water retention and shrink/swell properties of growing media during several drying/wetting cycles with varying intensities (0 <->-5 kPa, 0 <->-10 kPa, 0 <->-32 kPa). The measurements on slightly decomposed Sphagnum peat showed encouraging results. Regardless of the intensity of drying, water retention and shrink/swell properties are mainly modified after the first drying process, resulting in degradation of density and water retention, whereas these properties are unaffected by the other cycles, even if hysteresis phenomena are always shown to take place. Variations in drying intensity reveal different physical behaviors with an inflection point observed (i.e., a change in physical behavior) for the shrink/swell and water retention curves for the highest intensity tested (from -20 kPa).

AB Hydrologic and soil parameters were surveyed in three wetlands to determine the prevailing influences on vegetation distribution and composition. Five hydrologic parameters, four soil parameters, and the relative elevation of sampling plots in two restored wetlands and one reference wetland were compared. Bray-Curtis ordination techniques were used to discern correlations between the measured environmental parameters and the presence and abundance of twelve wetland plant species. Species' environmental preferences were then related to differences in vegetation distribution and composition between reference and restored wetlands. Data analysis revealed the strongest correlations between average water level, minimum water level, and depth of peat and the presence and abundance of the twelve wetland plant taxa. The relatively thin layer of peat found in the restored areas, and the consequent lower average and minimum water levels, was correlated with the presence and spread of Salix spp. The thicker layer of peat found in the reference area was correlated with the greater presence of the co-dominants Carer aquatilis and Calamagrostis canadensis.

AB Blister bark is a disease of increasing virulence representing a serious threat for apple orchards in several alpine valleys. Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae van Hall was indicated as a potential causal agent, among others. Plant growth conditions might affect disease bearing. Three growth substrates: silt loam soil, sandy loam soil and peat were tested in two different locations: one showing many cases of blister bark symptomsoccurrence and the other (up to present) symptoms-free. Leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence and leaf pigment content were measured in 2014 and 2015. Canopy growth, yield and plant biomass were measured and root biomass allocation pattern was described. Plant sanitary status was described and the possible presence of P. syringae was monitored. Silt soil reduced plant development while peat ensured the wider and healthier root system. Silt and sandy soils exposed plants to the risk of stress with a significant reduction of leaf gas exchanges in the presence of inaccuracies in water management. During autumn early blister bark symptoms occurred in sandy and silt soils only in the previously symptoms-free area. During next spring several plants grown in sandy soil and in peat, resulted symptomatic in the location characterized by previous attacks. In all symptomatic plants P. syringae pv. syringae was isolated. This study indicates that a poor plant physiological status exposed plants to early attacks even in the presence of low environmental inoculum. Conversely a vigorous vegetative growth might further expose plants to the risk of spring attack in locations with high inoculum pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In lowland areas of the Netherlands, any peat sediments will gradually become enriched with anthropogenically derived Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Due to Dutch policy standards these (anaerobic) sediments are not allowed to be dredged and placed onto land. Under aerobic conditions, however, biodegradation of PAH is greatly enhanced. This degradation is further stimulated by colonisation of the sediments by earthworms. Laboratory experiments show that although earthworms do not avoid PAH-contaminated sediment, their burrowing-activity is reduced. Furthermore, these sediments have no significant ecotoxicological impacts on earthworms. Experimental introduction of earthworms into PAH-contaminated OECD-soil will result in a decrease in overall PAH content. In field surveys no significant differences in earthworm numbers between locations with fresh and old sediment could be found. It is concluded that dredging of PAH-contaminated sediment poses a very limited environmental threat, and that putting these sediments on land will improve PAH-biodegradation, partly through the colonisation by and activities of earthworms.

AB Dinitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria is of particular importance for the nutrient economy of cold biomes, constituting the main pathway for new N supplies to tundra ecosystems. It is prevalent in cyanobacterial colonies on bryophytes and in obligate associations within cyanolichens. Recent studies, applying interspecific variation in plant functional traits to upscale species effects on ecosystems, have all but neglected cryptogams and their association with cyanobacteria. Here we looked for species-specific patterns that determine cryptogam-mediated rates of N(2) fixation in the Subarctic. We hypothesised a contrast in N(2) fixation rates (1) between the structurally and physiologically different lichens and bryophytes, and (2) within bryophytes based on their respective plant functional types. Throughout the survey we supplied (15)N-labelled N(2) gas to quantify fixation rates for monospecific moss, liverwort and lichen turfs. We sampled fifteen species in a design that captures spatial and temporal variations during the growing season in Abisko region, Sweden. We measured N(2) fixation potential of each turf in a common environment and in its field sampling site, in order to embrace both comparativeness and realism. Cyanolichens and bryophytes differed significantly in their cyanobacterial N(2) fixation capacity, which was not driven by microhabitat characteristics, but rather by morphology and physiology. Cyanolichens were much more prominent fixers than bryophytes per unit dry weight, but not per unit area due to their low specific thallus weight. Mosses did not exhibit consistent differences in N(2) fixation rates across species and functional types. Liverworts did not fix detectable amounts of N(2). Despite the very high rates of N(2) fixation associated with cyanolichens, large cover of mosses per unit area at the landscape scale compensates for their lower fixation rates, thereby probably making them the primary regional atmospheric nitrogen sink.

AB Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone (THPSS) and Coastal Upland Swamps in the Sydney Basin (CUSSB) are listed as endangered ecological communities under Australia's national and state legislation. They are threatened by a range of human and climate impacts. Across the region there are 3208 individual, valley-bottom, elongate-shaped, upland swamps that drain first- or second-order drainage lines and small catchment areas (mean = 0.25 km(2)). They occur at a median distance of 57 km from the coast in areas with an average annual rainfall of 1505 mm/year and average annual temperature of 15 degrees C. Those closer to the coast occur on elevations as low as 160 m a.s.l., and those further from the coast, on plateau country, occur up to 1172 m a.s.l. (median 634 m a.s.l.). The valleys that contain these swamps terminate downstream at a valley constriction or bedrock step, behind which alluvial materials have accumulated, and peat has formed to produce relatively steep swamps (median slope 6.2 per cent). Understanding the spatial distribution and physical attributes of these systems, and having the accompanying maps as a resource, is critical for development of sound, well-informed conservation, rehabilitation and monitoring programs, and for analysing the ecosystem services they provide.

   SEQUESTRATION
AB The growing of ornamental plants for urban greening has significant environmental and economic implications. In particular, the intensive use of peat and high-quality water at the nursery stage is sensitive due to the problems of soil depletion and water salinization even in urban areas. In these contexts, a preference for salinity-resistant species and cultivation techniques based on the substitution of low-impact materials could be beneficial.
   Here, an experiment has been carried out with two ornamental plant species - cherry laurel [Prunus laurocerasus L.] which is salinity-sensitive, and phillyrea [Phillyrea latifolia L.] which is salinity-resistant - using substrates containing different amounts of biochar in place of peat. Moreover, using irrigation water at two different salinity concentrations, we assess the extent to which the biochar can mitigate salinity damage in these plant species. The results of this study showed that the addition of biochar to the potting medium had no effect on plant growth but crucially limited cherry laurel salinity damage. Tolerance to salinity was attributed to lower Na+ retention in the biochar-containing substrates. Based on these findings, we conclude that the application of biochar not only reduces the amount of peat required in growth substrates, but can also permit the utilization of low-quality irrigation water - thereby also reducing the leaching of nutrients such as K+ and N-NH4+.

AB It has been hypothesized that major global fires occurred following a bolide impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Evidence for this has been mainly from 'soot' or black carbon at a number of marine boundary sites as well as the occurrence of inertinites (fusinite) in coals above the boundary. In addition, the occurrence of fossil charcoal (inertinites) in potential Tsunami deposits has been used to strengthen this idea. However, fire is known to have been widespread throughout the Cretaceous based on the distribution of fossil charcoal, and it is necessary to evaluate the claims for a global fire at the K-T boundary within the context of this more extensive record of ancient fires. The occurrence of the K-T boundary within the Sugarite coal sequence in the Raton Basin, New Mexico, offers the opportunity to assess the incidence of fire in local peat-forming vegetation, in the latest Cretaceous, across the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary interval and in the earliest Tertiary. The distribution of fire products, i.e. fossil charcoal, is assessed using a combination of inertinite group macerals in polished blocks of coal and plant particles released by chemical maceration of coal. Inertinite group macerals (fusinite, semifusinite, inertodetrinite), which represent fossil charcoal, and particles of charcoal in maceration residues are abundant throughout the Sugarite coal sequence, both before, during and after the K-T boundary event. Samples from below the boundary yield inertinites that constitute more than 20% of the coal; three horizons are inertinite rich (> 50%). Fire was obviously an important element of the terrestrial environment during the latest Cretaceous. High inertinite values and abundant charcoal particles characterize the latest Cretaceous part of the coal, the carbonaceous shale just below the boundary, the boundary interval itself and Tertiary coals and carbonaceous shales above the boundary. Charcoal in mineral-rich units of the latest Cretaceous, immediately below the boundary, in the boundary interval and in the Tertiary, is dominated by small inertodetrinite particles. These might have been wind blown from regional fires or they may reflect reworking during erosion, which led to sediment input into the mire. In either case the charcoal signature in these units is the same, irrespective of their position in the sequence. Our data, combined with that from two other sites in terrestrial sequences in North America, show that fires were an integral part of mire ecosystems through the latest Cretaceous and into the early Tertiary. Therefore, evidence for distinctive global wildfires at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary would have to be sought from careful consideration of other aspects of charcoal deposition, including flux rates for charcoal and soot.

AB Investigations of a sedimentary sequence exposed in the distal margin of a small debris cone in the valley of Pasture Beck, eastern Lake District, have yielded detailed information concerning the time and nature of cone aggradation phases and the local vegetation and land-use history. Radiocarbon dates from two buried peat beds indicate that the cone surface was generally stable from the late 8(th) to the early 13(th) centuries AD (1165-736 cal. BP). An interlude of colluvial gravel deposition interrupted peat accumulation and was probably the result of a single short-lived event. Gravel-dominated beds represent deposition of reworked rockfall debris and glacial drift by cohesionless debris flows, whereas finer-grain beds are probably the result of sheet-flows derived by washout of fines from debris-flow deposits. The stratigraphic evidence indicates that the minerogenic sediments accumulated in quick succession. Pollen and charcoal data from peat samples reveal intensification of land-use before burial of the peats by minerogenic sediments. It is proposed that landscape instability was associated first with Norse-Irish settlement and woodland clearance, and later, probably, to the expansion of upland pastures and more intensive grazing in the 13th century AD. When the Pasture Beck data is considered along with information from elsewhere in the British Isles, it is apparent that not all patterns of Late Holocene landscape change in upland areas can be ascribed to a single cause.

AB Permineralized samples of the tree fern Psaronius sp. belong to the spectacular discoveries of the Lower Permian Rotliegend 'Petrified forest of Chemnitz', one of the most famous palaeontological sites in the world. The cellular tissues of the 280 million years old fossil fern show a delicate three-dimensional preservation by permineralization. Moreover, anatomical detail can be distinguished very well because of the black coloured former cell walls. By means of Raman spectroscopy this fossilised tissue of the adventitious roots is revealed to be carbon which structure seems to correspond to anthracite. The aim of this work is the experimental confirmation of the carbon structure by means of thermogravimetry and Raman spectroscopy on coal samples of different rank, especially anthracite samples from different times and localities.
   Coal maturation involves the sequence peat-lignite-coal-anthracite-microcrystalline graphite by incresasing the density and specific energy. The loss of in situ moisture (typically up to 200 degreesC) and volatile organic matter (up to 600 degreesC) has been acquired by thermogravimetry. The increasing carbon content, density resp. structure results in Raman spectra with typical band shape of the D- and G-peaks. We used these methods to characterise and compare the separated coal samples to the dispersed carbon inclusions in permineralized Psaronius. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is evidence that oxidation of CH4 to CO2 by methanotrophic bacteria in forest soil is a major sink for atmospheric CH4, even though growth of the bacteria on such low CH4 concentrations (< 1.7 mu L L(-1)) is perplexing. Measurements of CH4 and CO2 in a northern hardwood ecosystem in the Adirondack Park in the state of New York indicated that: (i) soil CH4 concentrations were mostly higher than the concentration of CH4 in forest air, with concentrations as high as 500 mu L L(-1) at the 0.1-m depth in the early and late parts of the growing season; (ii) soil CO2 concentrations ranged from the atmospheric level to as high as 19 000 mu L L(-1) at the 0.2-m depth in midsummer; (iii) net consumption of atmospheric CH4 emission by soil in midsummer averaged only 0.25 mg m(-2) d(-1), which is low compared with findings for most forest ecosystems; and (iv) methanogenesis occurred in soil samples throughout the profile when incubated anaerobically as well as aerobically with CH3F to inhibit methanotrophs. The prominent activity of methanogenic bacteria producing CH4 in the spring and autumn could support the growth of methanotrophic bacteria that otherwise consume atmospheric CH4 when methanogens are not active. Therefore, CH4 dynamics in this Spodosol represent the balance between CH4 production and CH4 oxidation, which is similar to the CH4 dynamics in many wetland ecosystems.

AB Planting shrubs above-grade with organic matter has shown potential for improving landscape establishment. To further investigate this technique, wax myrtle [Morella cerifera (syn. Myrica cerifera)] (3 gal) and mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia 'Olympic Wedding') (5 gal) were planted on 30 Oct. 2006 (fall planting) and 12 Apr. 2007 (spring planting) in the ground in a shade house in Auburn, AL. At each planting date, plants of each species were assigned one of four treatments. Three of four treatments used a modified above-grade planting technique in which shrubs were planted such that the top 3 inches of the root ball remained above soil grade. Organic matter, either pine bark (PB), peat (PT), or cotton gin compost (CGC), was applied around the above-grade portion of the root ball, tapering down from the top of the root ball to the ground. In the fourth treatment, plants were planted at-grade with no organic matter (NOM). In general, both species had higher shoot dry weight (SDW) and root spread (RS) when planted in the fall than when planted in spring. Among all treatments, plants also typically had larger RS when planted above-grade with PB or PT. For easy-to-transplant species (such as wax myrtle) and especially for difficult-to-transplant species like mountain laurel, fall planting using this modified above-grade planting technique with PB or PT may improve post-transplant root growth and speed establishment in the first growing season.

AB This study was carried out on a coal seam of the "Untere Brackwasser-Molasse'' (Chattian), about 50 cm thick, interbedded with non-bituminous and bituminous limestones. Coals and associated beds were analysed megascopically (lithotype analysis), petrologically (maceral and microlithotype analysis) and geochemically (Rock-Eval pyrolysis).
   The vertical distribution of lithotypes and microlithotypes point to water I:able oscillations during the period of peat accumulation. The site of peat accumulation, however, was permanently covered with water.
   Maceral analysis reveals a dominance of detrovitrinite-subgroup macerals with variable liptinite-group and inertinite-group macerals. The amount of mineral matter is slight. Therefore, the coals are characterized by high gelification index (GI) values and low tissue preservation index (TPI) values. Plant remains found in the coals indicate that conifers were an important component of the peat-producing flora. The high degree of tissue degradation, typical of the coals, is the result of a high bacterial activity in the calcium-rich peat swamp and probably also of the occasionally brackish conditions. The limestones, which are rich in ostracods, bivalves and charophytes, have a variable TOC content (3-26%) and their organic matter is of terrestrial origin with a mixed liptinitic/vitrinitic character.
   The depositional environment is interpreted as a swamp forest with a variable density of herbaceous vegetation situated in a lower delta plain. Feat accumulation began subaquatically and probably influenced by brackish conditions. The main phase of peat accumulation represents autochthonous to hypautochthonous pear deposition under predominantly fresh-water conditions. A periodic rise in the water table due to the interaction of subsidence and compaction as well as eustatic sea-level rise, led to the deposition of the limestones under fresh - to brackish water conditions. Feat accumulation was terminated by a progressive drowning of the pear swamp accumulation and by a shift towards brackish conditions.

AB Science-based information on historical fire frequency is lacking for longleaf pine sandhills. We undertook a high-resolution macroscopic charcoal and geochemical analysis of sediment cores recovered from three depression marshes located within a longleaf pine sandhill ecosystem in Florida, USA. A similar to 1500-year fire history reconstructed from >1.5 m length peat cores analyzed at decadal to multi-decadal resolution revealed abundant macroscopic charcoal particles at nearly all sampling intervals, suggesting that fire occurred near the sites for almost all decades represented in the deposit. This result supported previous hypotheses of a frequent natural fire return interval for Florida's longleaf pine sandhills and suggested that management decisions for this ecosystem should continue to focus on the frequent prescription of controlled burns. Our research also demonstrated that some of Florida's depression marshes contain a >3000-year archive of organic-rich peat. Bulk elemental carbon and nitrogen data and stable carbon isotope analysis of the deposits at two of the three study sites suggested persistently wet soils. Soil data from the third site suggested that drying and peat oxidation occurred periodically. These depression marshes rapidly sink carbon, with measured sequestration rates on the order of 16 to 56 g m(-2) yr(-1). Our research demonstrated that Florida's depression marshes provide an untapped record of paleoenvironmental information.

AB Due to the high rates of N fertility necessary for producing high-quality turfgrasses, quick, reliable methods of determining the N status of turfgrasses would be valuable management tools. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the use of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to schedule N fertilization on two dwarf-type bermudagrasses [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt Davy]. The second objective was to test the accuracy of NIRS-predicted mineral tissue concentrations. The third objective was to study the effect of N fertility on thatch development. 'Tifdwarf' and 'FloraDwarf' bermudagrasses grown on sand-peat (9:1 by volume) were subjected to five treatments using time, NIRS-predicted N thresholds, and a visual quality rating threshold to schedule applications of (NH4)(2)SO4 for 20 wk per growing season in 1997 and 1998. There were positive linear relationships between total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and NIRS-predicted N in 1997 (r(2) = 0.76; slope = 0.96) and 1998 (r(2) = 0.92; slope = 1.06). NIRS-scheduled fertility resulted in similar quality with less fertilizer than time or visual quality-based fertility. The NIRS mineral concentration predictions for K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu were positively correlated with traditional laboratory methods, but there was not sufficient precision in measurements to use NIRS for determination of these nutrients. Thatch development and yields were greater in treatments receiving higher rates of fertilizers, suggesting that excessive growth rates due to high rates of applied fertilizer may have contributed to thatch development.

SO COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of biosolids compost, in the formulation of media used in the commercial production of container grown nursery crops, has been slow in the Northeast region of the United States. When biosolids compost is used in growing media, it is limited to small percentages. Regulations in Connecticut restrict the use of most biosolids compost to growing media for containerized ornamental plants and landfill cover. Information on the benefits of using biosolids compost, to grow a wide range of plant species in containers, could increase usage by nurseries. Seven species of flowering annuals, nine species of herbaceous perennials and eight species of woody ornamentals were grown in media containing 0, 25, 50, and 100 percent (by volume) biosolids compost, in combination with a mixture of bark, peat and sand, Biosolids compost came from the Metropolitan District Corporation (MDC) facility in Hartford, Connecticut. It was a mixture of wood chips and digested biosolids (3:1 by volume). Optimal plant growth generally occurred in media containing 50 and 100 percent compost. Plants growing in media high in compost were often somewhat stunted and chlorotic for several weeks after planting probably due to higher levels of salinity and ammonium nitrogen in their media. However, by the middle of the growing season these plants had recovered and at season's end, they were often superior to plants grown in media with less compost. Increasing proportions of compost generally increased the amounts of plant nutrients and heavy metals in media while decreasing air filled pore space. All heavy metal concentrations were below levels of concern.

The geochemical properties of the sediments were characterized by the chemical and mineral compositions as well as leaching experiments and sequential extractions of As. The results showed that higher As content of 4-9 mg/kg was observed in peat layers with organic matter content > 10 wt%, and that higher As contents deeper than 8 m below the surface were also observed. The deeper sediments were likely to be formed in brackish water conditions due to lower weight ratios of organic carbon content to sulfur content (C/S < 10). The results of the leaching experiments showed that As was mobilized at slightly alkaline region. These indicate that the distribution of As depended on the organic content in the sediments and sedimentation condition, and that the mobility of As in the sediment was affected by pH.

AB Climate warming is expected to have a large impact on plant species composition and productivity in northern latitude ecosystems. Warming can affect vegetation communities directly through temperature effects on plant growth and indirectly through alteration of soil nutrient availability. In addition, warming can cause permafrost to thaw and thermokarst (ground subsidence) to develop, which can alter the structure of the ecosystem by altering hydrological patterns within a site. These multiple direct and indirect effects of permafrost thawing are difficult to simulate in experimental approaches that often manipulate only one or two factors. Here, we used a natural gradient approach with three sites to represent stages in the process of permafrost thawing and thermokarst. We found that vascular plant biomass shifted from graminoid-dominated tundra in the least disturbed site to shrub-dominated tundra at the oldest, most subsided site, whereas the intermediate site was co-dominated by both plant functional groups. Vascular plant productivity patterns followed the changes in biomass, whereas nonvascular moss productivity was especially important in the oldest, most subsided site. The coefficient of variation for soil moisture was higher in the oldest, most subsided site suggesting that in addition to more wet microsites, there were other microsites that were drier. Across all sites, graminoids preferred the cold, dry microsites whereas the moss and shrubs were associated with the warm, moist microsites. Total nitrogen contained in green plant biomass differed across sites, suggesting that there were increases in soil nitrogen availability where permafrost had thawed.

AB Core and outcrop analysis from Lena mouth deposits have been used to reconstruct the Late Quaternary sedimentation history of the Lena Delta. Sediment properties (heavy mineral composition, grain size characteristics, organic carbon content) and age determinations (C-14 AMS and IR-OSL) are applied to discriminate the main sedimentary units of the three major geomorphic terraces, which form the delta. The development of the terraces is controlled by complex interactions among the following four factors: (1) Channel migration. According to the distribution of C-14 and IR-OSL age determinations of Lena mouth sediments, the major river runoff direction shifted from the west during marine isotope stages 5-3 (third terrace deposits) towards the northwest during marine isotope stage 2 and transition to stage 1 (second terrace), to the northeast and east during the Holocene (first terrace deposits). (2) Eustasy. Sea level rise from Last Glacial lowstand to the modern sea level position, reached at 6-5 ka BP, resulted in back-filling and flooding of the palaeovalleys. (3) Neotectonics. The extension of the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge into the Laptev Sea shelf acted as a halfgraben, showing dilatation movements with different subsidence rates. From the continent side, differential neotectonics with uplift and transpression in the Siberian coast ridges are active. Both likely have influenced river behavior by providing sites for preservation, with uplift, in particular, allowing accumulation of deposits in the second terrace in the western sector. The actual delta setting comprises only the eastern sector of the Lena Delta. (4) Peat formation. Polygenetic formation of ice-rich peaty sand ("Ice Complex") was most extensive (7-11 m in thickness) in the southern part of the delta area between 43 and 14 ka BP (third terrace deposits). In recent times, alluvial peat (5-6 m in thickness) is accumulated on top of the deltaic sequences in the eastern sector (first terrace). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB 1 Bryophytes played a dominating role in recolonizing bare surfaces left by severe fires which destroyed the vegetation and variable amounts of peat on parts of the North York Moors in the dry summer of 1976, Ashed pear (AH) was normally first colonised by Ceratodon purpureus, followed by Polytrichum piliferum with dominance later tending to pass to P. commune. Charred surfaces and progressively granulating peat (GP) remained largely bare except for patches of Dicranella heteromalla, Pohlia nutans and Poltrichum spp.
   2 On charred surfaces recreated in this study and GP bryophyte cover was < 10% after one year, compared with 22% on ash. Shelter and lime treatments resulted in nearly 100% cover on some charred peat and ash, but superficially charred peat and GP still had < 50% cover.
   3 Glasshouse trials confirmed that charred surfaces and GP had some residual chemical deficiency or toxicity even when physical conditions were improved.
   4 In hanging-drop cultures, Pohlia nutans germinated well on extracts of all surface-types and Funaria hygrometrica germinated well on extracts from AH and GP; Polytrichum commune gave about 10% germination on AH, and D. heteromalla about 10% germination on AH and GP. Germination of C. purpureus on all the burnt surfaces, and of F. hygrometrica on the charred surfaces appeared to be nutrient or pH-limited. Germination of F. hygrometrica, D. heteromalla and the Polytrichum species was apparently inhibited to varying degrees by water-soluble extracts from the charred surfaces.
   5 Protonema of Pohlia nutans grew well on extracts from all surfaces. D. heteromalla grew well on AH and to some extent on GP; F. hygrometrica showed some growth on extracts from AH and GP, Growth of C. purpureus and D. heteromalla appeared to be nutrient- or pH-limited on some or all of the burnt surfaces. Extracts from the burnt surfaces reduced growth of F. hygrometrica and almost or completely suppressed growth of Campylopus pyriformis and the Polytrichum species.
   6 The pH appeared to be an important factor affecting germination and growth for most species; there was a significant positive correlation between germination and pH of the culture solution (range 3.5-6.4) for all species but Ceratodon purpureus and Pohlia nutans.
   7 In glasshouse trials, toxicity from lichen/alga crusts on intact peat surfaces reduced germination of D. heteromalla by c. 50%; the similar effect on germination of Polytrichum piliferum was not statistically significant.
   8 Wind-tunnel experiments showed that the surface of charred peats and GP dried quicker than AH under high-radiation conditions. Except for Campylopus pyriformis, which survived to -390 MPa, the protonema of all the mosses was killed by 24h exposure at -23 MPa; protonema of Polytrichum commune was the most sensitive to slight desiccation.
   9 Ash is chemically and physically favourable for moss establishment. Freshly charred surfaces are chemically unfavourable. Establishment on these surfaces can only occur if there is an adequate interval between amelioration of chemical conditions and the onset of physical instability and granulation of the peat surface.

AB The influence of permafrost growth and thaw on the evolution of ice-rich lowland terrain in the Koyukuk-Innoko region of interior Alaska is fundamental but poorly understood. To elucidate this influence, the cryostratigraphy and properties of perennially frozen sediments from three areas in this region are described and interpreted in terms of permafrost history. The upper part of the late Quaternary sediments at the Koyukuk and Innoko Flats comprise frozen organic soils up to 4.5 m thick underlain by ice-rich silt characterised by layered and reticulate cryostructures. The volume of visible segregated ice in silt locally reaches 50 per cent, with ice lenses up to 10 cm thick. A conceptual model of terrain evolution from the Late Pleistocene to the present day identifies four stages of yedoma degradation and five stages of subsequent permafrost aggradation-degradation: (1) partial thawing of the upper ice wedges and the formation of small shallow ponds in the troughs above the wedges; (2) formation of shallow thermokarst lakes above the polygons; (3) deepening of thermokarst lakes and yedoma degradation beneath the lakes; (4) complete thawing of yedoma beneath the lakes; (5) lake drainage; (6) peat accumulation; (7) permafrost aggradation in drained lake basins; (8) formation of permafrost plateaus; and (9) formation and expansion of a new generation of thermokarst features. These stages can occur in differing places and times, creating a highly complex mosaic of terrain conditions, complicating predictions of landscape response to future climatic changes or human impact.

AB In this article, an intermediate CO2 storage system for long-distance ship transportation was modeled. The storage terminal links the continuous CO2 liquefaction process to discrete marine ship transportation and performs as a buffer between them. It is composed of four distinct processes: a CO2 input process, a storage tank and loading process, a recirculation process, and a BOG (boiled-off gas) reliquefaction process. The entire system should be operated as a liquid phase. Consequently, operation conditions, tank capacity, insulation specification, and streamflow rates play a major role in operating the storage terminal securely. The goal of this study is to design a base case of the storage terminal and propose its appropriate operation condition which makes the terminal operate with minimum operation energy. Results of the base case simulations are compared with improperly insulated systems on the pipeline and tanks that generate more BOG than the base case. The total operation energies of the base case and case studies are presented, and it turns out that approximately three times the operation energy is required if the system is not properly designed.

AB Nitrogen deposition was experimentally increased on a Scottish peatbog over a period of 13 years (2002-2015). Nitrogen was applied in three forms, NH3 gas, NH4Cl solution, and NaNO3 solution, at rates ranging from 8 (ambient) to 64 kgNha(-1) yr(-1), and higher near the NH3 fumigation source. An automated system was used to apply the nitrogen, such that the deposition was realistic in terms of rates and high frequency of deposition events. We measured the response of nitrous oxide (N2O) flux to the increased nitrogen input. Prior expectations, based on the IPCC default emission factor, were that 1% of the added nitrogen would be emitted as N2O. In the plots treated with NH4+ and NO3- solution, no response was seen, and there was a tendency for N2O fluxes to be reduced by additional nitrogen, though this was not significant. Areas subjected to high NH3 emitted more N2O than expected, up to 8.5% of the added nitrogen. Differences in the response are related to the impact of the nitrogen treatments on the vegetation. In the NH4+ and NO3- treatments, all the additional nitrogen is effectively immobilised in the vegetation and top 10 cm of peat. In the NH3 treatment, much of the vegetation was killed off by high doses of NH3, and the nitrogen was presumably more available to denitrifying bacteria. The design of the wet and dry experimental treatments meant that they differed in statistical power, and we are less likely to detect an effect of the NH4+ and NO3- treatments, though they avoid issues of pseudo-replication.

AB A Pliocene lignite seam up to 160 m thick occurs in the Velenje basin (Slovenia). The seam originated in a topogenous mire and evolved within a non-marine, transgressive setting. Differences in soluble organic matter yield and hydrocarbon content of borehole samples from the lignite are related to differences in the composition of free lipids of microbial origin and/or hydrocarbons derived from the biogeochemical degradation of plant tissue. Variations of the redox conditions within the mire are reflected by pristane/phytane ratios. The abundance of terpenoid biomarkers indicates the predominance of gymnosperms over angiosperms, which is consistent with palynomorphic spectra dominated by pollen of the Sequoia-Taxodium-Metasequoia plant community rather than by angiosperms. Evidence is also provided that the content of land plant derived biomarkers and the preservation of plant tissue is controlled by the input of resin-rich, decay-resistant conifers. Sections of the seam characterized by a high degree of gelification of humotelinite (gelification index) show high contents of hop-17(21)-ene but low hopane concentrations. The results suggest that the gelification of plant tissue may be governed by the activity of anaerobic rather than aerobic bacteria. Despite the minor variation in the proportions of gymnosperms versus angiosperms in the peat-forming vegetation, a general influence of the floral assemblage on carbon isotopic composition of the coals (delta(13)C -25.3 to -27.0parts per thousand) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is assumed to affect the delta(13)C value of the lignite. Petrographic and geochemical data of gelified and ungelified fossil wood provide evidence that gelification may be governed by microorganisms (e.g. anaerobic bacteria) different from those responsible for decreasing cellulose contents during early diagenetic, aerobic degradation of wood. Based on the molecular composition of terpenoid biomarkers, the wood fragments are identified as derived from gymnosperms. The relative proportions of saturated versus aromatic hydrocarbon fractions of fossil gymnosperms display a general tendency towards lower values in gelified wood remains. This indicates that bacteria involved in gelification of plant tissue may also be involved in aromatisation of diterpenoid hydrocarbons. The chemotaxonomical classification of the macrofossils as gymnosperms is corroborated by the mean carbon isotopic compositions of the macrofossils (delta(13)C = -24.5parts per thousand) and the extracted cellulose (delta(13)C = -22.0parts per thousand). The higher isotopic difference of about 2.5%. between cellulose and fossil wood, compared to that found in modern trees, can most probably be explained by the smaller effect of C-13 discrimination for cellulose when compared with wood during decomposition [Chem. Geol. 158 (1999) 121]. Compared with the coals, the delta(13)C values of wood and extracted cellulose are affected to a minor extent by microbial activity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial processes contribute largely to the greenhouse effect and climate change. One of these industries is the cement industry, which contributes around 8% of CO2 emissions caused by mankind. Two promising and interesting ways to reduce CO2 emission are the utilization of alternative cementitious materials and carbon capture and utilization through CO2 mineralization. In this study, peat-wood fly ashes from fluidized bed combustion were used as a construction material for mineral carbonation. A self hardening characteristic of this type of fly ash was utilized, and simultaneous carbonation and hydration reactions were studied. The study showed that fly ashes from the fluidized bed combustion of peat and wood could be used to capture and mineralize CO2 during hydration reactions. At the same time, CO2 could improve the strength of self-hardened fly ashes. One interesting future possibility is fly ash tile production at energy plants: fly ashes can be used to capture CO2 from flue gases, thus improving the strength of produced tiles.

AB The rate of biochemical decomposition of organic matter in drained peaty soils has been studied for the common, mixed, and cover farming systems with a concurrent analysis of hydrothermic conditions. The maximum depletion of peat was observed in the plow horizon for the black system and in the plow and subplow horizons for the mixed system. For the cover system, two maximums were found for the biochemical decomposition of organic matter (in the plow horizon and in the zone of the open capillary fringe). Sanding and cover culture enhance the biochemical depletion of peat. Protection against the degradation is associated with control of the ground water table.

AB Different micro-mesoporous carbons derived from d-glucose (GDC), granulated white sugar (WSDC) and highly decomposed Estonian peat (PDC) were synthesized using hydrothermal carbonization and direct activation methods. The resulting carbonaceous materials were activated using chemical (KOH and ZnCl2) and physical (CO2) activation methods. The electrochemical characteristics of the electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) based on 1 M Et3MeNBF4 solution in acetonitrile and EtMeImBF(4) were measured using two-electrode cells. The EDLCs assembled had specific capacitances from 20 up to 158 +/- 18 F g(-1) (in EtMeImBF(4)) and phase angle values from - 65 degrees to - 88 degrees (at low frequencies). The characteristic time constant values vary more than 10 times. Applying constant power discharge method, very high energy and power densities (34 W h kg(-1) at 10 kW kg(-1)) for activated carbon powders-based EDLCs have been measured. Fitting of impedance data showed that enhanced mesoporosity reduces the adsorption and mass-transfer resistance values.

AB Potting mixes prepared with dark, highly decomposed Sphagnum peat, with light, less decomposed Sphagnum peat, or with composted pine bark, all three of which were colonized by indigenous microorganisms, failed to; consistently suppress Rhizoctonia damping-off of radish or Rhizoctonia crown and root rot of poinsettia. Inoculation of these mixes with Chryseobacterium gleum (C299R2) and Trichoderma hamatum 382 (T-382) significantly reduced the severity of both diseases in the composted pine bark mix in which both biocontrol agents maintained high populations over 90 days. These microorganisms were less. effective against damping-off in the light and dark peat mixes, respectively, in which populations of C299R2 declined. In contrast, crown and root rot, a disease that is severe late in the crop, was suppressed in all three types of mixes. High populations of T-382 in all three mixes late during the cropping cycle may have contributed to control of this disease.

AB Combined magnetic mineral, organic and inorganic carbon content and geochemical analysis were conducted on laminated sediments from Santa Maria del Oro, a crater lake in Nayaril (western Mexico), to build up a model of the paleoenvironmental conditions for the last 2,600 years. This sequence is of particular importance as it constitutes a high resolution record of late Holocene climatic and environmental change in west-central Mexico. The analyses attained in this study allowed to recognize abrupt changes, to identify dry periods, and to compare these variations with available records in central Mexico. Laminations are caused in general by alternations of their main components: lithogenic detritus, biogenic and authigenic carbonates, and amorphous material from biological and volcanic remains. The volcaniclastic accumulations include two tephras, one of them, the Toba Jala, produced by the Cehoruco volcano. Six facies of silt, sand and peat were recognized Horizons characterized by high inorganic carbon content, authigenic siderite, and the dissolution of the finest ferrimagnetic mineralogy (magnetite) in reductive conditions, are upward followed by an increase in the concentrations of fine grained ferrimagnetic minerals. This sequence represents dissolution-precipitation cycles of magnetic minerals by anoxic/oxic variations in the water-sediment interface during warmer and dryer periods. These environmental conditions are especially present around 600 - 1140 A. D., and 1410 - 1830 A.D., which coincide with the archeological Classic period (300 - 900 A.D.) drought, the Little Ice Age (1350 - 1800 A.D.) and the droughts of the last 700 years. The effects of climatic variations such as the drought occurred in the archeological Classic period, the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, and the droughts over the last 700 years, have been documented in sites along central Mexico.

AB A sediment core has been retrieved from Vanevan peat (south-eastern shore of Lake Sevan, Armenia), which is today disconnected from Lake Sevan thanks to an artificial shallowing of the lake. Based on 5 radiocarbon dates, Vanevan record covers the Mid Holocene (from ca. 7800 to ca. 5100 cal. BP). The Late Holocene is today absent in the peat stratigraphy due to modern peat exploitation by surface mining. This study focuses on a multi-proxy approach including pollen, charcoals, and pollen-inferred climate reconstruction.
   An open-land, steppic vegetation is recorded up to ca. 7700 cal. BP, followed by a more forested landscape during the Mid Holocene (up to ca. 5700 cal. BP), and ending again with an open-land vegetation (to the end of record, 5100 cal. BP). This vegetation dynamics responds to general climate changes documented in the Near East. Whether human activities are documented since ca. 7500 cal. BP (Late Neolithic) in Vanevan, they remain marginal and probably did not affect the area. Early Holocene dry climate, which caused the steppic environment to be widespread through the Near East, is strongly related to low late spring precipitation (PMay-Jun = 180 mm). Mid Holocene forested landscape and increasing lake-level seem related to late spring precipitation (+28%), which is the main change in estimated climate parameters. This has to be linked with reinforcement of the Westerlies and less active Siberian High, which are inversely involved in the following, dry phase starting at ca. 5700 cal. BP.

AB River regulation since the 17th century, large-scale drainage, and intensive farming have seriously transformed soils in the river valleys of Poland. Flood suppression and groundwater lowering have created oxidizing conditions in topsoil and allowed biological activity and plant rooting, which has retarded original stratification of the alluvial substratum. However, ploughing has led to the development of thick humus horizons. In particular, soils with organic topsoil horizons have been changed, i.e. they have lost their initial swampy nature and have undergone an anthropogenic transformation to mineral soils. Despite the long-term agricultural land use, it is still possible to recognize the peaty character of organic matter in some soils and this allows reconstruction of their origin. This study investigated a sequence of soils in the valley of the river Barycz: (i) occasionally flooded, very moist Fluvic Histic Gleysols, with a Murshic organic layer, (ii) weakly drained soils with a high groundwater table, deeply ploughed, where the sandy plough layer contains easily recognizable peat-derived organic material, weakly bound to the mineral fraction (Fluvic Anthromollic Gleysols), and (iii) deeply drained soils, deeply ploughed, where organic carbon content in the plough layer is below 10%, but peat-derived particles of organic matter are still recognizable and are weakly bound to the mineral fractions [(Endogleyic Phaeozems (Anthric) or Endogleyic Umbrisols (Anthric)]. None of the thick plough layers, although intentionally created by humans by mixing the organic layer with underlying sandy material, fulfill the requirements of the anthropogenic diagnostic horizons. Therefore, two new qualifiers are proposed to the WRB classification in relation to the recent addition of the "Murshic" qualifier, namely "Anmooric" and "Attic", to allow accurately naming the postswampy soils at subsequent stages of their transformation.

AB The relationships between vegetation, hydrology, and the landscape-forming processes of erosion and deposition are examined in channels of the northeastern Okavango Delta, Botswana. Channel development appears to be due to the confinement of rapid water movement by vegetation processes and peat formation in backswamp areas. The channels have sandy beds and densely vegetated banks composed of erosion-resistant peat deposits between 1.5 m and 4 m thick. Sediment introduced into the delta is transported as bed-load, is unable to escape from the peat-lined channels and is therefore deposited along the channel floor. Channels that receive their water supply directly from source areas are therefore dominated by depositional processes. In contrast, channels that receive their water supply as overspill from these aggrading source channels do not receive bed-load sediments from source areas, and their beds tend to be erosional. Channel switching is therefore suggested to be due to a combination of erosional and depositional processes, rather than simply the result of depositional processes as has previously been suggested. A conceptual model of channel development and change within the northeastern Okavango Delta is presented.

AB Histosols are a huge reservoir for C, covering <1% of the world's land surface but storing up to 12% of total soil C. Thorough comprehension of factors controlling the rate of soil C loss from Histosols is critical for proper management of these C sinks. Two experiments evaluated how formerly cultivated, warm-climate Histosols undergoing wetland restoration respond to decreases in soil temperatures via vegetative shading, under different water table conditions. We compared temperature and soil CO2 efflux differences from intact soil cores under three levels of light reduction in a greenhouse: 0%, 70%, and 90%. Soil in full sun was consistently warmer and showed higher efflux rates than 70% and 90% shade treatments: 4.132, 3.438, and 2.054 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Shade treatments reached peak efflux rates at similar water potential, -2 to -4 kPa. A field experiment subjected in-situ soil to full sun, 70% light reduction, and light reduction from naturally occurring herbaceous vegetation. Shade treatment effects on soil temperature and C mineralization were evident throughout the growing season. Vegetative shade effects on soil temperature were greatest in August and September when soil under vegetation was 5-11 degrees C cooler than unshaded soil. Soil CO2 efflux was correlated strongly with soil temperature; daily efflux rates were consistently highest from unshaded soil. Efflux across treatments showed a strong seasonal correlation to soil moisture, increasing as soil dried in response to water table decline. Soil water potential was unaffected by shade treatment, suggesting temperature effects were solely responsible for efflux differences between treatments. All results confirm that surface shading has a strong influence on soil temperatures and C mineralization rates. Management to enhance vegetative shading in wetland restoration projects may be an effective strategy for slowing soil C losses and promoting soil C sequestration when O-2 is not limiting.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has a major influence upon sorption/desorption and transport of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in soil environments. However, the molecular mechanisms of DOC sorption and its effects on aged HOC desorption in contaminated soils still remain largely unclear. Here, effects of three different DOC (one from commercial peat and two from biochars produced at 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C pyrolysis temperatures, respectively) and oxalate (as a reference) on abiotic desorption behavior of aged phenanthrene from three agricultural soils were investigated. Results showed that desorption of aged phenanthrene from soils was predominantly dependent on soil organic carbon content. The presence of DOC and oxalate resulted in higher desorption of phenanthrene compared to water alone, and the effects were positively related to soil organic carbon content and DOC/oxalate concentration. The facilitating effects of DOC were further increased during the second consecutive desorption, whereas oxalate had no such effect. Ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry confirmed the molecular fractionation of DOC at the soil-water interface during DOC sorption. Specifically, the DOC molecules with O-rich moieties were preferentially adsorbed, whereas the molecules with phenolic and aromatic structures were selectively retained in the soil solutions through competitive displacement and co-sorption reactions during sorption. The enriched phenyl structures in the retained DOC facilitated its association with phenanthrene in the solutions and thus the release of phenanthrene from the soils. In contrast, oxalate replaced some organic carbon from the soils and thus released the associated phenanthrene into the solutions. Our findings highlight the importance of the molecular composition and structure of DOC for the desorption of phenanthrene in soil-water environments, which may help improve our understanding of the release and transport of organic compounds in the environments.

AB Humic substances (HS) constitute 50-80% of total dissolved organic matter (DOM) in freshwaters but in the open ocean < 3%, indicating that large fractions of DOM and HS are removed in the estuarine and coastal zone. In order to assess the role of bacteria in this removal, we conducted experiments in flow-through cultures to examine the decomposition of peat bog-born humic acids (HA) by marine (salinity 30, Exp1) and estuarine (salinity 10, Exp2) bacterial communities. After similar to 70 days 40-> 60% of the HA were decomposed. Highest fractions were decomposed in treatments in which the bacterial communities were fed by HA media of a foreign salinity, e.g., of 14 in Exp1 and of 28 in Exp2. Some of the HA material was not decomposed but broken down to smaller moieties entering the fulvic acid (FA) fraction. The analysis of the HA media and their residuals after bacterial decomposition by pyrolysis GC/MS showed that individual organic compounds were decomposed. In Exp1, 32 aliphatic and aromatic compounds, including lignin biomarkers, were detected in the HA medium of which mainly aliphatic compounds were decomposed. In Exp2, 49 compounds were detected of which similar to 40-60% were not detected any more after bacterial decomposition in the HA fraction but still in the FA fraction. The results show that estuarine and marine bacterial communities can decompose large amounts of HA and that this process is important in reducing the amount of terrestrial HS and DOM entering the estuarine and coastal region.

AB The objectives of this study are to (1) characterize the carbon (C) content, leaf area index, and aboveground net primary production (ANPP) for mature aspen, black spruce, and young and mature jack pine stands at the southern and northern Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) areas and (2) compare net primary production and carbon allocation coefficients for the major boreal forest types of the world. Direct estimates of leaf area index, defined as one half of the total leaf surface area, range from a minimum of 1.8 for jack pine forests to a maximum of 5.6 for black spruce forests; stems comprise 5 to 15% of the total overstory plant area. In the BOREAS study, total ecosystem (vegetation plus detritus plus soil) carbon content is greatest in the black spruce forests (445,760-479,380 kg C ha(-1)), with 87 to 88% of the C in the soil, and is lowest in the jack pine stands (68,370-68,980 kg C ha(-1)) with a similar distribution of carbon in the vegetation and soil. Forest floor carbon content and mean residence time (MRT) also vary more among forest types in a study area than between study areas for a forest type; forest floor MRT range from 16 to 19 years for aspen stands to 28 to 39 years for jack pine stands. ANPP differs significantly among the mature forests at each of the BOREAS study areas, ranging from a maximum of 3490 to 3520 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for aspen stands to 1170 to 1220 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for jack pine stands. Both net primary production (NPP) and carbon allocation differ between boreal evergreen and deciduous forests in the world, suggesting global primary production models should distinguish between these two forest types. On average, 56% of NPP for boreal forests occurs as detritus and illustrates the need to better understand factors controlling aboveground and below-ground detritus production in boreal forests.

AB Concentrations of total carbon and nitrogen were measured by gas chromatography method, and the carbon content of inorganic compounds was determined by the volumetric method in soils of undisturbed coastal landscapes of the Barents Sea (Khaypudyrskaya Bay). Two groups of soils were specified. The first group included saline marsh soils formed under flooding by tidewater and surging seawater. The second group included soils of tundra ecosystems, which were subjected to precipitation of marine aerosols. In the first group, the content of C-org varied from 5 to 75 g/kg, the content of N total varied from 1 to 5 g/kg, and the C-org/N-tot ratio varied from 10 to 18. Humus-accumulative horizons buried under recent marine sediments were described in the middle part of the marsh soil profile. In the second group, the contents of C-org was 430-470 g/kg and N-tot 4-7 g/kg. The C-org/N-tot ratio in the surface peat horizons equaled to 64-95 g/kg and decreased by three-seven times in the deeper layers. The soils of the low-level marshes flooded each tide and especially their surface horizons contained more inorganic carbon than any other soils. Mass fraction of inorganic carbon varied from 4 to 20% of the total carbon content. Seawater and carbonate-containing rocks could be the source of the inorganic carbon. A correlation was found between the contents of C-org and N-tot in soils and in plant communities growing on these soils. Additional input of C-org and N-tot into marsh soils was due to the living activity of birds and to organic substances in seawater.

AB Archaeological excavations and environmental archaeological studies over many years in the Shanghai Area have provided a wealth of information for Holocene environmental changes, growth and decline of human settlements and man-land interaction. Distribution of archaeological sites between 7000 and 3000 cal. yr BP indicates a regression process and a southward advance of the coastline in the study area. Temporal and spatial analyses of C-14 dates for archaeological sites, shell ridges, buried trees, and peat suggest that Holocene environmental changes may well have been a major cause of the rise and fall of human settlements and their civilization. A relative sea-level curve of the Shanghai Area was derived from dated shell ridges and peat, and correlates well with the reconstructed sea-level curves of the Yangtze Delta and East China. The development of human settlements was interrupted at least four times in the Shanghai Area, matching four periods of high sea-level, peat accumulation, and increase in shell ridges, after which Neolithic communities moved onto the plain and reclaimed their lowlands for rice cultivation. The Chenier Ridges played an important role in sheltering the Neolithic settlers. The collapse of Liangzhu Culture about 4000 cal. yr BP was followed by the less-developed Maqiao Culture. These studies suggest that extreme environmental and hydrological conditions such as terrestrial inundation caused by sea-level rise and heavy rainfall, contributed to the cessation of paddy exploitation and to the social stress that led to the Liangzhu Culture demise.

AB Entry of metals in form of aerosols into areas of high air humidity such as peat bogs represents a serious danger for inhabiting organisms such as the unicellular desmid Micrasterias denticulata Breb. ex Ralfs (Desmidiaceae, Zynematophyceae, Streptophyta). To understand cellular detoxification and tolerance mechanisms, detailed intracellular localization of metal pollutants is required. This study localizes the metals aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and cadmium (Cd) in the green algal model system Micrasterias after experimental exposure to sulfate solutions by highly sensitive TEM-coupled electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Concentrations of the metals shown to induce inhibiting effects on cell development and cytomorphogenesis were chosen for these experiments. Long-term exposure to these metal concentrations led to a pronounced impact on cell physiology expressed by a general decrease in apparent photosynthesis. After long-term treatment, Zn, Al, and Cu were detected in the cell walls by EELS. Zn was additionally found in vacuoles and mucilage vesicles, and Cu in starch grains and also in mucilage vesicles. Elevated amounts of oxygen in areas where Zn, Al, and Cu were localized suggest sequestration of these metals as oxides. The study demonstrated that Micrasterias can cope differently with metal pollutants. In low doses and during a limited time period, the cells were able to compartmentalize Cu the best, followed by Zn and Al. Cu and Zn were taken up into intracellular compartments, whereas Al was only bound to the cell wall. Cd was not compartmentalized at all, which explains its strongest impact on growth, cell division rate, and photosynthesis in Micrasterias.

AB Pools and fluxes of N in wetland vegetation and soils were compared with an adjacent upland site to assess the relative importance of wetland versus upland landscapes in watershed N-retention in the Adirondack Mountains of New York (U.S.A.). The majority of N storage occurred in forest soils and wetland peat deposits (96 and 99% of total N in upland forests and wetlands, respectively). Annual N-uptake (49 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) was greater for wetland vegetation than that of upland vegetation (30 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). In the wetland the supply of N from mineralization (36 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) was less than N-uptake; in contrast, upland N mineralization (76 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) exceeded N vegetation uptake. Annual N-storage in peat was small due to low peat accretion rates. Wetlands acted as a sink for N and stored a disproportionally high fraction (15%) of catchment N in relation to their relatively small surface area (similar to4%) within the catchment.

AB The European Alps are a geomorphologically active region and experience a number of gravity-driven hillslope processes. Soil and landscape formation in the Alps has consequently undergone several minor and major traceable changes of developmental trajectories during the Holocene. Soil development is hypothesised to be often non-linear with time and characterised by stages of progressive and regressive evolution caused by up building (formation, profile deepening) and erosion (profile shallowing). Several cold and warm climate phases are identified during the Holocene but it is largely unknown which effects these might have had on slope processes. By using datable moraines (Be-10) and mires (C-14), we have constructed a temporal framework for these processes. Using the geochemical imprint of mires in the Alpine setting of the Goschener-valley of the Central Swiss Alps, we reconstructed general (mostly erosional) landscape processes for the last ca. 10 ka. As this is the type locality for the Goschener cold phase, we assumed that this phase (Goschener cold phase I and II similar to 1.5 and similar to 2.5 ka BP) should have left easily recognizable traits. After deglaciation (11-12 ka BP), soil evolution was progressive. Beginning around 8 ka BP, we detect a distinct increase in erosion here, together with a vegetation change (towards tundra vegetation) and the highest measured rates of carbon sequestration. Other phases of high geomorphic activity were recognised ca. 5-6 ka BP, 4 ka BP and, to a lesser extent, 1-3 ka ago. The cold phase at 5-6 ka BP corresponds to a less distinct change in vegetation and lessened erosion. Human impact is increasingly obvious since about 2.4 ka BP which overlaps with the Goschener cold phase. Nonetheless, erosion processes were not extraordinarily high during this period and a climate effect cannot be distinguished. We detect evidence of increasing human disturbance (regressive soil evolution) for about the last 1 ka. We also detect an increase in dust flux during the last ca. 4-5 ka, presumably due to the landscape change(s) in the Sahara during this time.

AB An integrated analysis of megascopic lithotype, microscopic maceral and mineral composition, stable carbon isotope and interburden sedimentology from a single well was used to interpret the response of the Late Permian Fort Cooper Coal Measures (FCCM) to regional and global environmental influences. The FCCM are differentiated from underlying, relatively high vitrinite Moranbah Coal Measures, and overlying higher inertinite Rangal Coal Measures in the Bowen Basin by their intercalation with abundant tuff and siliciclastic partings and interbeds. Besides this, there is little described about the variation in the organic composition of the FCCM and its causes. The FCCM can be subdivided into a lower aggradational Fair Hill Formation, transgressed by the shallow marine derived Black Alley Shale that interfinger with/is overlain by the progradational Middle Main Seams and Burngrove Formation coal measures. The coals are dominantly dull with minor bright bands that are more abundant in the Burngrove Formation representing a change in plant composition. The maceral analysis shows that the coals in the Fair Hill Formation and Middle Main Seams are vitrinite-rich (80-90% mmf) albeit with high mineral matter suggesting the formation of precursory peat under rising water levels and with high sediment (tuff) influx and preservation. The coals in the Burngrove Formation have an increased inertinite content (30% muff) but are also high in mineral matter suggesting a shift to increased decomposition arising from a fluctuating water table, possibly increased aridity and/or microbial activity. Tuffs occur throughout, and although their frequency is higher in the lower Fair Hill Formation, the preservation of thicker tuffs in the upper Burngrove Formation indicates increased intensity of volcanism that could have modified the environment. Variation in carbon isotope compositions show a parabolic trend, from around -24.1%a in the Fair Hill Formation to more variable values in the Middle Main Seams with an overall C-13-enrichment upwards in the Burngrove Formation, prior to the delta C-13 values becoming negative (depleted between -1 to -4% from the average -24.1%0) in the top seams and into the overlying Rangal Coal Measures. The C-13-depletion trend in the upper part of the section is unexpected in view of corresponding increase in inertinite content of the coals indicating that the delta C-13 values/plant composition and inertinite content are decoupled, unless the inertinite origin is from intense microbial decay. Similar stable carbon isotope depletion trends have been observed elsewhere in an equivalent strati graphic interval of the Bowen Basin suggesting that the carbon isotope values are responding to global conditions that cause negative excursions in carbon isotopes before the P-T boundary. Overall, the basin was continuously subsiding and peats accumulated with constant interruptions from excessive sedimentation and volcanic eruptions. The low proportion of visible thick bright bands coupled with high telovitrinite (mmf) content suggests a marsh to fen environment, with an open canopy and ponding able to preserve volcanic ash falls.

AB Thermokarst lakes form following the thaw of ice-rich permafrost and drain after a few decades to millennia. Drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs) become epicenters for peat accumulation and re-aggradation of ice-rich permafrost. This re-aggradation of permafrost may be interrupted by subsequent thermokarst lake formation with sufficient disturbance. Thermokarst lakes and DTLBs are abundant near Old Crow, Yukon, Canada, but little is known about their evolution through the Holocene. In this study, we investigate the hydrology and drainage histories of seven DTLBs from the Old Crow Flats on the basis of cryostratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, and pore-ice delta O-18 and delta H-2 records. Cryostratigraphic evidence implies only one of the seven studied DTLBs underwent multiple thermokarst cycles. Radiocarbon age-depth models demonstrate a slowdown in the rate of post-drainage peat accumulation with time. Pore-ice isotope analyses reveal a spectrum of possible post-drainage isotopic histories resulting from spatial variability in permafrost, vegetation, and hydrology. Unlike lacustrine silt, post-drainage peat contains relatively constant pore-ice isotope trends. In light of our findings, we propose that syngenetic peat permafrost in DTLBs preserve a warm-season sampling of local meteoric waters. These pore-ice delta O-18 and delta H-2 records may aid millennial-scale paleoclimate investigations, as we demonstrate through our reconstruction of Holocene climate change in northern Yukon.

TI PETROGRAPHIC CHARACTER OF COAL SUBSTANCE FROM SALT SEDIMENTS IN THE

SO GOSPODARKA SUROWCAMI MINERALNYMI-MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
LA Polish
DT Article
DE Petrography of coal; brown coal; xylite; salt rocks; Miocene; Wieliczka
AB The salt-bearing sequence in Wieliczka comprises two members. In the lower, bedded part (stratiform deposit) the salt rocks arc layered and form elongated structures similar to scales and asymmetrical folds. The upper part (boulder deposit) is developed as coarse breccia mainly composed of salt clays (so-called zubers), with blocks of coarse-grained salts. These blocks are of irregular size and shape and range from 1 m(3) to giant blocks of about 100000 m3 in volume.
   In the litostratigraphical profile of salt series (Fig. 1) we can distinguish the following sediments (from the bottom): base anhydritic claystone and rock salt called the oldest salt bed; sandstones and claystones with layers anhydrite called the "sub-salt sandstone" or "undersalt sandstone"; 4-5 layers of coarse crystalline salt called green bedded salt; the bed of shaft salt and the complex of salty banks with layers of claystones and siltsones and admixture of anhydrite called the complex of "spisa salt". In upper part of the deposit there arc marly claystones and zubers (marly claystone with the suspended grains of crystalline halite), among which are placed the irregular blocks of coarse-grained and crystalline salt so-called lumpy green salt (e.g. Galamay et.al. 1997).
   Coal layers and carbonized plant fragments in salt rocks are known from many underground excavations and were mentioned for example through Gawel (1962), Kolasa (1982, 1990), Bukowski (1997). Particularly abundant accumulations of carbonized plant fragments and coal layers occur in the complex of sub-salt sandstone (p.1 - Fig.1), in the upper part of spisa salts (p.2 - Fig.1) and within barren rocks of boulder deposit (p.3 - Fig.1). The aim of this paper is presenting results of examinations of coal substance derived from these salts complexes.
   Two forms of coal material from the profile of salt rocks from the Wieliczka deposit have been distinguished after petrographic investigation:
   - coal layers and coal pockets in salt (upper spiza salts) and conglomerates of the boulder part of deposit,
   - coal debris of xylitie coal and detritic coal in sandstone and conglomerate of sub-salt sandstone complex.
   Coal layers in salt rocks of at most several centimeters of thickness can be easily distinguished by black color and cubic divisibility. They are mainly built of rare type of lignite -gelific coal (75%) with the great amount of fine xylite (25%). Gelific coal is composed for the most part of gelinite maceral (cugelinite - 74%), whereas xylite is built of textinite (22%) and fusinite (3%) occasionally. Pyrite (1 %) is also found to be one of its ingredients.
   Coal layers and coal pockets in conglomerates are about several millimeters thick. They are mainly consisted of gelinite (81%) but their important components are also meccrals of lipnite group (up to 15%): cutinite (12%) descended from leaves, resinite (1%) that is fossil resin from gymnosperms trees and liptodetrinite (2%). Interesting form of gelinite is its striated form arose as a result of progressive filling of primary rock pockets and bug holes by organic gel.
   The petrographic composition of coal fragments in complex sub-salt sandstone is very diverse. There can mainly be found xylite (80%) of size of gravel and sand grains. There is also debris of detritic and gelinite coal (up to 20%). Xylite is gelified to different degree. It is to a large extent composed of textoulminite and cuulminite but also of textinite. Typical elements of it arc fragments consisted of semifusinite and fusinite continually converting into texinite. Xylite fragments are often impregnated by pyrite. Lithoclasts of detritic coal arc composed of densinite (85%) with a small amount of gelinite grains (up to 5%) as well as macerals of lipnite group-cutinite and resinite (up to 6%). Additionally, they consist of fine-grained pyrite and quartz. There is a parallel composition of coal detritic in subsalt sandstone complex.
   Coal material is humic and it has a low rank of coalification. It consists of 61.2 to 65.0% C - elemental carbon content, recalculated to dry and ash-free basis. The coefficient of random reflectivity of cuulminite B is 0.22 to 0.25%. That is typical for coal that is described as ortho lignite C (ECE-UN 2003).
   Coal in profile of salt series of Wieliczka mine is visibly allochtonous. It comes from peat deposits evolved around marine salt bays. The petrographic composition suggests salinized moores of fen type, generally forest swamp and open marsh. It is plausible that there were also raised bogs, evidently related to rheotropic, riverine zone. Organic material was washed off and then transported in the organic sol form by the streams and deposited in water of salted water reservoir (coal layers) or it was transported to the reservoir in the form of lithoclasts of peat and detritus.

AB A link between microbial life history strategies and soil organic carbon storage in agroecosystems is presumed, but largely unexplored at the gene level. We aimed to elucidate whether and how differential organic material amendments (manure versus peat-vermiculite) affect, relative to sole chemical fertilizer application, the link between microbial life history strategies and soil organic carbon storage in a wheat-maize rotation field experiment. To achieve this goal, we combined bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS amplicon sequencing, metagenomics and the assembly of genomes. Fertilizer treatments had a significantly greater effect on microbial community composition than aggregate size, with soil available phosphorus and potassium being the most important community-shaping factors. Limitation in labile carbon was linked to a K-selected oligotrophic life history strategy (Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria) under sole chemical fertilizer application; defined by a significant enrichment of genes involved in resource acquisition, polymer hydrolysis, and competition. By contrast, excess of labile carbon promoted an r-selected copiotrophic life history strategy (Cytophagales, Bacillales, Mortierellomycota) under manure treatment; defined by a significant enrichment of genes involved in cellular growth. A distinct life history strategy was not observed under peat-vermiculite treatment, but rather a mix of both K-selected (Acidobacteria) and r-selected (Actinobacteria, Mortierellomycota) microorganisms. Compared to sole chemical & nbsp;fertilizer application, soil organic carbon storage efficiency was significantly increased by 26.5% and 50.0% under manure and peat-vermiculite treatments, respectively. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of organic material amendments, but in particular a one-time peat-vermiculite application, to promote soil organic carbon storage as a potential management strategy for sustainable agriculture.

AB Turcotte, I. and Quideau, S.A. 2012. Phenolic profiles in natural and reconstructed soils from the oil sands region of Alberta. Can. J. Soil Sci. 92: 153-164. This research was conducted in the Athabasca oil sands reclamation area of northeastern Alberta, where land reclamation entails reconstruction of soil-like profiles using salvaged materials such as peat and mining by-products. Successful reclamation is in part dependent on the quality of the organic capping of these reconstructed soils. This study investigated organic matter composition between reconstructed and natural soils. Soil samples (0-10 cm) were taken from 45 plots to represent a range of reclaimed and undisturbed sites. The botanical origin of soil organic matter was characterised through cupric oxide oxidation, which yields lignin monomers hypothesized to reflect vegetation inputs and extent of decomposition based on time since reclamation. Additional soil organic matter parameters were obtained using acid hydrolysis, physical separation and ramped cross polarisation C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Yields of vanillyl phenols, coumaryl phenols, p-hydroxy phenols, summed lignin phenols and total phenolic constituents were significantly higher in natural soils than in reconstructed soils. We suggest that there may be an accelerated decomposition of peat phenols in reconstructed soils, which would leave only those phenols representative of the vascular plant history accumulated in the initial peat profile.

AB Ephemeral ponds (EPs) are small isolated wetlands within a forested upland matrix that typically flood in spring and dry over the growing season. We compared the vegetation of permanent wetlands to that of EPs to describe: 1) plant community structure, 2) functional group structure, 3) alpha- and beta-diversity patterns including shared species, and 4) floristic quality. We studied 57 wetlands (33 ephemeral, 24 permanent) in the Chippewa Moraine region of northwestern Wisconsin during 2013-2014. Vegetation analysis separated wetlands into 3 groups: EPs (n = 33), sedge meadow (SM; n = 11), and lacustrine fringe (LF; n = 13) wetlands. EPs had high specific conductivity, soluble reactive P and total P, small area and catchment size, and high canopy cover compared to permanent wetland communities. Ephemeral and permanent wetlands had highly variable water depth, pH, peat depth, and tree basal area. EPs had a higher proportion of woody indicator species (50%) than did permanent wetlands (9.1%). SMs and LFs had a high graminoid cover, whereas EPs had high annual, fern, and woody vegetation cover. Species richness guild structure was similar among the different wetland groups, except for EPs, which had a higher proportion of woody plant species. Both EPs and LFs had significantly lower a and higher b diversity than SMs. EPs had significantly higher species turnover than LFs or SMs. Higher proportions of species were shared within than among wetland classes. The mean proportion of EP species in permanent wetlands was relatively low (similar to 30%). A higher proportion of EP species was shared with SMs than LFs. EPs floristic quality was intermediate to that of SMs (high) and LFs (low), indicating that EPs do not have low floristic quality. EP species in the glaciated Upper Midwest may not be endemic, but the EP plant community is different from those of permanent wetland types and worthy of conservation.

AB We performed detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination to compare seven successional seres running in stone quarries, coal mining spoil heaps, sand and gravel pits, and extracted peatlands in the Czech Republic in central Europe. In total, we obtained 1,187 vegetation samples containing 705 species. These represent various successional stages aged from 1 to 100 years. The successional seres studied were more similar in their species composition in the initial stages, in which synathropic species prevailed, than in later successional stages. This vegetation differentiation was determined especially by local moisture conditions. In most cases, succession led to a woodland, which usually established after approximately 20 years. In very dry or wet places, by contrast, where woody species were limited, often highly valuable, open vegetation developed. Except in the peatlands, the total number of species and the number of target species increased during succession. Participation of invasive aliens was mostly unimportant. Spontaneous vegetation succession generally appears to be an ecologically suitable and cheap way of ecosystem restoration of heavily disturbed sites. It should, therefore, be preferred over technical reclamation.

AB Nearly all Hg in vegetation is derived directly from the atmosphere. Mass of Hg in forest vegetation (roughly 0.1 mg m(-2)) is about an order of magnitude smaller than that in the forest floor (1 mg m(-2)) and two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the mineral soil (10 mg m(-2)). Mass of Hg in peat (20 mg m(-2)) is greater than the sum of that in mineral soil and the forest floor; wetlands usually sequester more Hg than associated uplands. The strong relationship of Hg to organic matter, associated with binding by reduced S groups, is fundamental to understanding Hg distribution and behavior in terrestrial systems. The stoichiometry of the Hg-C relationship varies; Hg-S relationships, though less variable, are not constant. Because of the Hg-organic matter link, landscape conditions that lead to differential soil organic matter accumulation are likely to lead to differential Hg accumulation. The ratio of methylmercury (MeHg) to total Hg is generally low in both vegetation (near 1.5%) and soil (< 1%), but areas of poorly drained soils and wetlands are sites of MeHg production. The annual emission of anthropic Hg from the 48;contiguous states of the USA (144 Mg) is two orders of magnitude less than the pool of Hg in forests of those states (30 300 Mg). Peattands, less than 2% of total land area, sequester more than 20 times annual emissions (2930 Mg). If global climate change affects C storage it will indirectly affect Hg storage, having a major effect on the balance between emissions and sequestration and on the global Hg cycle.

AB Bobov Dol subbituminous coal from Bulgaria was studied by chloroform extraction and subsequent TMAH thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation. The molecular composition of the "free" bitumen was compared with the products of residue pyrolysis. GC/MS separation registered lipids, i.e. n-alkanes and terpenoids, mainly sesqui- and diterpenoids, predominantly aromatized. Pyrolysis released additional portions of n-alkanes, regular isoprenoids, n-fatty acids, hopanes, etc. Direct extraction of "free" bitumen with chloroform and TMAH thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation of the residue attained somewhat different lipid pools of coal organic matter. The results of TMAH thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation demonstrated that, despite the relatively advanced geological age of the sample (Late Oligocene) some lignin remnants were still preserved. The following species were registered: 3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyacetophenon and 3 methoxy-4-hydroxy benzoic acid. By analogy with the lignin structure of modern trees, the abundance of vanillic structures indicated conifers as the predominant coal-forming vegetation in the Bobov Dol peat bog. Fatty acids in "free" bitumen and in the products of thermochemolysis were compared and certain differences were depicted. The presence in the pyrolysate of linear mono- and dicarboxylic fatty acids, mainly of higher plant origin, revealed the role of ester linkages in coal organic matter structuring at an R-o = 0.42-0.43% maturity. The experimental data denoted that lipid components and conifer lignin had considerable contribution to Bobov Dol coal organic matter. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated plant reproduction in relation to genetic structure, population size, and habitat quality in 13 populations of the rare biennial plant Pedicularis palustris with 3-28500 flowering individuals. We used AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) profiles to analyze genetic similarities among 129 individuals (3-15 per population). In a cluster analysis of genetic similarities most individuals (67%) were arranged in population-specific clusters. Analysis of molecular variance indicated significant genetic differentiation among populations and among and within subpopulations (P < 0.001). Gene flow (N(e) m) was low (0.298). On average, plants produced 55 capsules, 17 seeds per fruit, and 42 seedlings in the following growing season. The number of seeds per capsule was independent of population size and of genetic variability. In contrast, the number of capsules per plant (P < 0.05) and the number of seedlings per plant (P < 0.05) were positively correlated with population size. The relation between population size and the number of seeds per plant was not significant (P = 0.075). The number of capsules and of seeds and seedlings per plant (P < 0.01) were positively correlated with genetic variability. Genetic variability was independent of actual population size. suggesting that historical population processes have to be taken into account, too. Stepwise multiple regressions revealed additional significant relationships ol habitat parameters (soil pH. C:N ratio), vegetation composition, and standing crop on reproductive components. We conclude that populations of P. palustris are genetically isolated and that reproductive success most likely is influenced by population size, genetic variability, and habitat quality. Management strategies such as moderate grazing, mowing, and artificial gene flow should endeavor to increase population size as well as genetic variation.

AB A stratigraphic succession of alternating peat and minerogenic sediments at the foot of a steep mountain slope provides the basis for the reconstruction of a preliminary colluvial history from the alpine zone of Jotunheimen, southern Norway. Layers of silty sand and sandy silt, typically 5-10 cm thick and interpreted as distal debris-flow facies, are separated by layers of peat that have been radiocarbon dated. Deposition from at least 7500 to about 3800 C-14 yr BP of predominantly minerogenic material suggests relatively infrequent but large-magnitude debris-flow events in an environment warmer and/or drier than today. Particularly low colluvial activity between about 6500 and 3900 C-14 yr BP was terminated by a succession of major debris-few events between about 3800 and 3400 C-14 yr BP. Unhumified peats indicative of higher water tables, separate six debris-flows that occurred between about 3300 and 2300 C-14 yr BP and signify a continuing high frequency of colluvial activity. Uninterrupted peat accumulation between about 2400 and 1600 C-14 yr BP indicates reduced debris-flow activity; subsequent renewed activity appears to have culuminated in the 'Little Ice Age' after about 600 C-14 yr BP. This pattern of colluvial deposition demonstrates a long history of natural Holocene low-alpine landscape instability, suggests an increase first in the magnitude and then in the frequency of debris-flow activity coincident with late Holocene climatic deterioration, and points to the potential of debris-flow records as a unique source of palaeoclimatic information related to extreme rainfall events.

AB Miocene lignites representing a depositional history of about 7 million years (18-11 Ma before present) have been studied by organic petrological and organic geochemical methods including analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. The three lignite seams investigated (Morken, Frimmersdorf, Garzweiler) developed from peats which grew in a nutrient depleted paralic environment situated close to the sea. All seams have low ash/mineral matter contents, but seam Frimmersdorf is richer in sulfur as compared to seams Morken and Garzweiler. Sulfur richness and distribution in seam Frimmersdorf might be due to the diagenetic effect of sulfate reduction and pyrite precipitation following flooding by the sea and deposition of the marine Neurath sands on top of seam Frimmersdorf.
   Geochemical palaeotemperature analysis (GDGT) revealed a warm climate during deposition of the peats representing lignite seams Morken and Frimmersdorf which shifted towards lower temperatures (2-3 degrees C) during deposition of the uppermost seam Garzweiler, i.e., at about 13-11 Ma before present. This trend is basically supported by cellulose oxygen isotope values which show a significant scatter, however. Carbon isotope values are less variable, indicating predominance of angiosperms in the peat vegetation and rather stable environmental conditions as well as floral assemblage. Organic petrological studies reveal predominance of small plants and a nutrient depleted environment. A modified Groundwater Index (GWIac) was applied, suggesting deposition above the general groundwater level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global warming and land use changes, contributing to landscape level fuel increments, could threaten Mediterranean pine forest resilience to wildfire disturbances. Reconstructions of historical fire regimes allow for the disentanglement of these two drivers by comparing the influence of climatic and anthropogenic variables on fire. Here we combine three sources of historical data: charcoal accumulation rates from a peat bog, detailed historical records of fire incidence and tree-ring width data from five relict black pine (Pinus nigra) forests with fire-scarred trees located in Sierra de Gredos (central Spain). We found growth suppression in 1893 and 1894 in all the sites which coincided with a peak of fire incidence in historical records and an increase in charcoal accumulation rates. The occurrence of these three synchronous events suggests increased wildfire incidence in the area which shaped the current stand structure of relict black pine forests. These late 19th century developments, we argue, can be mainly attributed to anthropogenic factors and contributing climatic drivers. We argue that the dissolution of the "Mesta", the biggest transhumance livestock organization in Europe lasting from the 13th to the 19th centuries, led to more extensive grazing and uncontrolled use of forests and grasslands which likely contributed to increased wildfire incidence. Additionally, 1893 was characterized by anomalously warm spring temperatures which may have facilitated vegetation flammability. Our approach couples human and climate systems as drivers of historical fire incidence in Mediterranean pine forests.

AB Despite the fact that phosphorus (P) is critical for plant biomass production in many ecosystems, the implications of soil organic carbon (OC) sequestration for the P cycle have hardly been discussed yet. Thus, the aims of this study are, first, to synthesize results about the relationship between C and P in soil organic matter (SOM) and organic matter inputs to soils, second, to review processes that affect the C:P ratio of SOM, and third, to discuss implications of OC storage in terrestrial ecosystems for P sequestration. The study shows that the storage of OC in mineral soils leads to the sequestration of large amounts of organic phosphorus (OP) since SOM in mineral soils is very rich in P. The reasons for the strong enrichment of OP with respect to OC in soils are the mineralization of OC and the formation of microbial necromass that is P-rich as well as the strong sorption of OP to mineral surfaces that prevents OP mineralization. In particular, the formation of mineral-associated SOM that is favorable for storing OC in soil over decadal to centennial timescales sequesters large amounts of OP. Storage of 1,000 kg C in the clay size fraction in the topsoils of croplands sequesters 13.1 kg P. In contrast, the OC:OP ratios of wood and of peatlands are much larger than the ones in cropland soils. Thus, storage of C in wood in peatlands sequesters much less P than the storage of OC in mineral soils. In order to increase the C stocks in terrestrial ecosystems and to lock up as little P as possible, it would be more reasonable to protect and restore peatlands and to produce and preserve wood than to store OC in mineral soils.

AB Antarctica is a unique place for soil, biological, and ecological investigations. Soils of Antarctica have been studied intensively during the last century, when different national Antarctic expeditions visited the sixth continent with the aim of investigating nature and the environment. Antarctic investigations are comprised of field surveys mainly in the terrestrial landscapes, where the polar stations of different countries are situated. That is why the main and most detailed soil surveys were conducted in the McMurdo Valleys, Transantarctic Mountains, South Shetland Islands, Larsemann Hills and the Schirmacher Oasis. Our investigations were conducted during the 53rd and 55th Russian Antarctic expeditions in the base of soil pits, and samples were collected in Sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions. Sub-Antarctic or maritime landscapes are considered to be very different from Antarctic landscapes due to differing climatic and geogenic conditions. Soils of diverse zonal landscapes were studied with the aim of assessing the microbial biomass level, basal respiration rates and metabolic activity of microbial communities. This investigation shows that Antarctic soils are quite diverse in profile organization and carbon content. In general, Sub-Antarctic soils are characterized by more developed humus (sod) organo-mineral horizons as well as by an upper organic layer. The most developed organic layers were revealed in peat soils of King George Island, where its thickness reach, in some cases, was 80 cm. These soils as well as soils formed under guano are characterized by the highest amount of total organic carbon (TOC), between 7.22 and 33.70 %. Coastal and continental Antarctic soils exhibit less developed Leptosols, Gleysols, Regolith and rare Ornhitosol, with TOC levels between 0.37 and 4.67 %. The metabolic ratios and basal respiration were higher in Sub-Antarctic soils than in Antarctic ones, which can be inter-preted as a result of higher amounts of fresh organic remnants in organic and organo-mineral horizons. The soils of King George Island also have higher portions of microbial biomass (max 1.54 mg g(-1)) compared to coastal (max 0.26 mg g(-1)) and continental (max 0.22 mg g(-1)) Antarctic soils. Sub-Antarctic soils differ from Antarctic ones mainly by having increased organic layer thickness and total organic carbon content, higher microbial biomass carbon content, basal respiration, and metabolic activity levels.

AB Combined effects of co-occurring global climate changes on ecosystem responses are generally poorly understood. Here, we present results from a 2-year field experiment in a Carex fen ecosystem on the southernmost tip of South America, where we examined the effects of solar ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-315 nm) and warming on above- and belowground plant production, C : N ratios, decomposition rates and earthworm population sizes. Solar UVB radiation was manipulated using transparent plastic filter films to create a near-ambient (90% of ambient UVB) or a reduced solar UVB treatment (15% of ambient UVB). The warming treatment was imposed passively by wrapping the same filter material around the plots resulting in a mean air and soil temperature increase of about 1.2 degrees C. Aboveground plant production was not affected by warming, and marginally reduced at near-ambient UVB only in the second season. Aboveground plant biomass also tended to have a lower C : N ratio under near-ambient UVB and was differently affected at the two temperatures (marginal UVB x temperature interaction). Leaf decomposition of one dominant sedge species (Carex curta) tended to be faster at near-ambient UVB than at reduced UVB. Leaf decomposition of a codominant species (Carex decidua) was significantly faster at near-ambient UVB; root decomposition of this species tended to be lower at increased temperature and interacted with UVB. We found, for the first time in a field experiment that epigeic earthworm density and biomass was 36% decreased by warming but remained unaffected by UVB radiation. Our results show that present-day solar UVB radiation and modest warming can adversely affect ecosystem functioning and engineers of this fen. However, results on plant biomass production also showed that treatment manipulations of co-occurring global change factors can be overridden by the local climatic situation in a given study year.

AB Straw incorporation, a common agricultural practice for improving soil quality in paddy soil, leads to the increase of methane (CH4) emission. Application of biochar in soil is an attractive method to sequestrate carbon and reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. This study aimed at exploring the effect of biochar on CH4 emission in the paddy soil with straw incorporation.
   In this study, the low-temperature biochar (BC300) and high-temperature biochar (BC500 and BC700) were incubated with or without straw in soil. Soil CH4 fluxes were monitored during the whole period of laboratory incubation. Soil properties were measured, including pH, redox potential (Eh) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The abundance and composition of methanogenic archaeal and methanotrophic bacterial communities were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing, respectively.
   When no straw was applied, low-temperature biochar decreased soil Eh, increased the abundances of methanogenic archaea, and thus promoted the emission of CH4, while high-temperature biochar had little effect on CH4 emission. When straw was applied, biochar inhibited CH4 emission by decreasing the content of available carbon for methanogenic archaea. The inhibition effect of high-temperature biochar was stronger than that of low-temperature biochar.
   The results indicated that CH4 emission was affected by both biochar type and straw application. Biochar could significantly decrease CH4 emission when straw was returned to paddy soil, and the decrease induced by high-temperature biochar was stronger than that of low-temperature biochar.

AB The results of preliminary studies on nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and calcium bioaccumulation in the herbaceous plants of mid-forest spring niches are presented in this paper. Studies were conducted in the upper course of the Kamienna Creek, a left bank tributary of the Slupia River located in the area of the Forest Division Lesny Dwor (northern Poland). Groundwater, soil and plant samples were collected from three stands distributed within the headwater bog with Rheic Sapric Histosols covered by age-varied black alder. Based on N, P, K, Ca and Mg contents in the plants, groundwater and soils, bioaccumulation factors of these elements in plants were calculated in relation to groundwater (BFw) and soil (BFg). The investigated soils were characterized by strong decomposition of peat mass, acidic pH, high abundance in total nitrogen and low in phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and calcium. The chemical composition of the plants suggests an adequate nutrient supply, especially in the case of potassium, which accumulated in much higher amounts than physiological requirements. The investigated plant species were characterized by varied bioaccumulation factors of the studied elements. The highest bioaccumulation of N and Ca was noticed for Urtica dioica, P for Urtica dioica and Solanum dulcamara, Mg for Caltha palustris and Urtica dioica and K for Geranium robertianum. The shoots of Solanum dulcamara (N, P, K) and Urtica dioica (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) were characterized by a diversity of bioaccumulation factors. Our data confirm strong interactions between water, soil and plants as the main structural and functional components of headwater areas.

AB We used a P enrichment gradient in the Everglades to investigate patterns of the stable N isotopic ratio (delta N-15) in peat profiles as an indicator of historic eutrophication of this wetland. We also tested two hypotheses to explain the effects of P on increased delta N-15 of organic matter including: (1) increased N mineralization/N loss, and (2) reduced isotopic discrimination during macrophyte N uptake. Spatial patterns of delta N-15 in surface litter and soil (0-10 cm) mimic those of the aboveground macrophytes (Typha domingensis Pers. and Cladium jamaicense Crantz). Peat profiles also show increased delta N-15 in the peat accumulated in areas near the historic P discharges since the early 1960s. The increased delta N-15 of bulk peat correlated well with both measured increases in soil total P and the historical beginning of nutrient discharges into this wetland. In 15-day bottle incubations of soil, added P had no effect on the delta N-15 of NH4+ and significantly increased the delta N-15 of water-extractable organic N. Measurements of surface soils collected during a field mesocosm experiment also revealed no significant effect of P on delta N-15 even after 5 years of P addition. In contrast, delta N-15 of leaf and root tissues of hydroponically grown Typha and Cladium were shown to increase up to 12 parts per thousand when grown at elevated levels of P and fixed levels of N (as NH4+). The magnitude of changes in delta N-15 resulting from altered discrimination during N uptake is significant compared with other mechanisms affecting plant delta N-15, and suggests that this may be the dominant mechanism affecting delta N-15 of organic matter following P enrichment. The results of this study have implications for the interpretation of delta N-15 as an indicator of shifts in relative N limitation in wetland ecosystems, and also stress the importance of experimental validation in interpreting delta N-15 patterns.

AB An experiment was performed to examine the chemical and biological effects on high clay sodic subsoil following the incorporation and incubation with organic amendments. The main treatments consisted of amendments with wheat shoots, lucerne pellets and peat, and these were compared to gypsum addition. Additional treatments were residues of chickpea and canola, chicken manure and sawdust. All materials were finely ground and added to crushed and sieved soil at the rate of 1% by weight. Wheat, canola and chickpea residues and chicken manure resulted in modest reductions in soil sodicity. Carbon and N mineralization were related to the soluble C/total N ratio in the amendment. The initial mineralization of wheat amendment was rapid due to its soluble C content, but then slowed to have the lowest loss, of around one third of added C, of all the plant residues after 174 days. In comparison, lucerne-amended soil increased total N and lost almost half of its C after the 174-day incubation. The canola stubble amendment showed the highest carbon loss, losing 64% of its added C. The addition of gypsum resulted in high soil electrical conductivity which suppressed respiration, compared to the control soil, indicating a detrimental effect on microbial activity due to the high electrolyte concentration in the soil. The peat amendment, with a low-soluble C content, showed a similar respiration rate to the control soil, confirming that a source of soluble C is important for the initiation of rapid biological activity. Soil pH was significantly increased (by 0.6 of a pH unit) with addition of chicken manure, and still remained higher than control soil after 174 days of incubation. Lucerne was the only plant residue to increase soil pH, with the effect being sustained for 56 days. The study demonstrated how some organic amendments can improve chemical fertility and biological activity in high clay sodic subsoil, and at the same time contribute, after 25 weeks incubation, to an increase in carbon content.

AB The groundwater level of a conifer stand established on a lowland in eastern Canada was periodically measured using water wells installed in an experimental design composed of. four. completely randomized blocks and five levels of cutting (0, 40, 50, 60, and 100% of basal, area (BA) removed). The three partial cutting treatments were applied following the principles of low thinning, but with the seed cutting objectives of the shelterwood method. Before cutting, highly similar values for groundwater level were recorded for plots targeted to receive the planned treatments During the first growing season after cutting, the water table rise was linearly related to the percentage of cutting, and this effect was more apparent it the lower levels recorded for the control water table. This finding is partly explained by the leaf biomass of residual trees that intercepted an increasing proportion of rainfall with decreasing cutting intensity. Five years after cutting, although the water table of clearcut experimental units (EU) was still higher than that of the controls, it was no longer related to cutting intensity. During the 5 years following cutting, the slopes of the relationship between the water table depth of the control plots and those of any treatment gradually approached the value calculated before,cutting. This water table recovery was related to the increasing leaf biomass of the regeneration stratum over time, rather than to the crown expansion of residual trees. The shelterwood method should be considered for forest management of wetlands, since it mitigates water table rise after, the first cut and promotes a vigorous regeneration stratum which should also mitigate water table rise following the. final cut.

AB The Faroe Islands are characterized by high rates of Holocene geomorphological activity and demonstrable vegetation change, including substantial peat formation. Pedogenesis, especially in the late Holocene, is less well known. Numerous ferruginous rhizoconcretions consisting predominantly of Fe-oxyhydroxides were identified in loam and silty sands in SOltuvik on the island of Sandoy, dated prior to AD 1000. Their formation is related to intensive podzolization and they take the form of the source woody vegetation. The sub-fossil material represents the first evidence for ferruginous rhizoconcretions in the Faroese archipelago.

AB The rise of Holocene (ground)water level as a function of relative sea-level rise has been extensively investigated in the western Netherlands, whereas few studies focused on the Flevo lagoon in the central Netherlands. In this study, all available C-14 dates from the base of basal peat overlying the top of compaction-free Pleistocene sand in the former Flevo lagoon were evaluated in order to reconstruct water-level rise for the period 5300-2000 cal. yr BC. The present basal peat C-14 data set from Flevoland consists of two subsets: (1) the largely new Almere data (41 dates) representing the southern part of the former Flevo lagoon, with 26 dates especially carried out for this study, and (2) the existing Schokland data (21 dates) representing the eastern part of the lagoon. The Schokland area is located about 50 km from the Almere area. The quality of all basal peat time-depth data was palaeo-ecologically and geologically evaluated, all C-14 dates were calibrated to the same standards, and error margins of age and altitude determination were estimated. After plotting the data as error boxes in time-depth graphs, lower limit curves for water-level rise were constructed for both data sets. Comparison with the mean sea-level curve for The Netherlands (Van de Plassche, 1982) suggests that water-level rise in the Almere area between 5300 and 2000 cal. yr BC corresponded closely to the rise in mean sea level. The same holds for the Schokland area for the period 5000-4200 cal. yr BC. For the period 4200-2000 cal. yr BC, however, the Schokland data suggest water-level rise to have been slower than mean sea-level rise, leading to local water levels apparently below mean sea level, which is virtually impossible. Hypothetical explanations for this discrepancy include: errors and uncertainties in mean sea-level and local water-level reconstruction, basin subsidence and temporal differences in intra-coastal tidal damping. The presently available data are inconclusive at this point and Holocene water-level rise in the Flevo lagoon awaits further investigations.

AB Spongospora subterranea is a soilborne plasmodiophorid that causes powdery scab in potato. It also transmits potato mop-top virus (PMTV), which causes necrotic arcs (spraing) in potato tubers. Three field experiments were conducted in naturally S. subterranea-infested soil to investigate the effects of two chemicals, Omega 500F (fluazinam) and FOLI-R-PLUS RIDEZ (biological extract), on powdery scab, PMTV, and changes in S. subterranea inoculum with six different potato cultivars. The efficacy of soil treatment with these two chemicals on tuber lesions, root galling, and pathogen population was also assessed in greenhouse trials. The chemical treatments did not reduce powdery scab, root gall formation, or S. subterranea inoculum in the field or greenhouse trials. Postharvest S. subterranea soil inoculum in fields varied across farms and among potato cultivars but the pathogen population consistently increased by the end of the growing season. The evaluated russet cultivars were more tolerant to powdery scab than the yellow- or red-skinned cultivars but all were susceptible to PMTV. In the field, powdery scab indices and soil inoculum changes were positively correlated, while postharvest S. subterranea inoculum was positively correlated with root galling in both greenhouse trials. Powdery scab and PMTV occurred in noninoculated potting mix, indicating that peat-based potting mix is a source for both pathogens. These results demonstrate that chemical management methods currently used by farmers are ineffective, that S. subterranea and PMTV in potting mix can cause severe epidemics in greenhouses, and that potato cultivar choices impact inoculum increases in soil.

AB It is important to disentangle the effects of physical ecosystem modifications from plant-herbivore interactions to understand how keystone species, such as beavers, influence aquatic ecosystems, especially when populations are reintroduced or non-native. Through dam building beavers have the potential to influence macrophytes indirectly by altering the hydrological regime, but macrophytes also comprise a major component of beaver diet. In water bodies uninfluenced by dams, direct grazing will therefore be the primary basis of beaver-induced effects on macrophytes. Temporal change in macrophyte height, abundance and composition from three habitats within a pond system in Scotland were measured over a nine year period following beaver introduction. From 2003 to 2012, persistent, selective grazing by beaver led to three-fold increases in macrophyte richness and significant turnover in composition, reflecting overall reductions in abundance of the preferred dominant species (e.g. Iris pseudacorus). Within-season herbivory effects were quantified in 2011-2012 using exclosures and by conducting cafeteria-style choice experiments. Significant volumes of macrophyte biomass (mostly rhizomes of Menyanthes trifoliata) were removed at constant rates throughout the growing season. Feeding was highly selective whilst effects on diversity were negligible in the short term. In the medium term, selective foraging by beavers significantly increased alpha and beta diversity of macrophytes. Macrophytes in temperate and boreal regions are potentially widely influenced by beaver grazing, although the positive effects we observed are not necessarily universal and are unlikely to persist within individual sites indefinitely.

AB Two C-14-dated pollen profiles from mires in the steppe belt of southern Russia are presented. On the basis of these and data from earlier investigations, the Holocene forest history of the southern part of Russia and Ukraine is reconstructed. The steppe belt is very sensitive to climatic oscillations and, in particular, to changes in evapotranspiration. The most favourable climate occurred between 6000 and 4500 B.P. (6800-5200 cal. B.P.), when forest attained its maximum extent in the steppe belt. The period 4500-3500 B.P. (5200-3800 cal. B.P.) was characterised by drier climate with the most arid phase occurring between 4200-3700 B.P. (4700-4000 cal. B.P.). During arid phases, the area under forest and also peat accumulation rates declined. Subsequently, a number of less pronounced climatic oscillations occurred such as in the period 3400/3300-2800 B.P. (3600/3500-2900 cal. B.P.) when there was a return to more humid conditions. During the last 2500 years, the vegetation cover of the steppe belt in southern Russia and Ukraine took on its present-day aspect. On the one hand, there is close correlation between the Holocene vegetation history of southern Russia and Ukraine and, on the other hand, the steppe belt of Kazakhstan and transgressions in the Caspian sea. Human impact on the natural vegetation became important from the Bronze Age onwards (after 4500 B.P.; 5200 cal. B.P.). Particular attention is given to the history of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), which had a much wider distribution in the southern part of eastern Europe in the early Holocene. The reduction in range during recent millennia has come about as a result of the combined effects of both climatic deterioration and increased human impact.

DT Article
AB Clay mineral assemblages present within the coals and coal-bearing strata of the Wabamun area of the central Alberta Plains are a product of the original peat-accumulating and adjacent fluvial depositional environments. In the Highvale area, acidic conditions promoted by the accumulation and humification of thick peats were conducive to the diagenetic mineralization of kaolinite from parent volcanic ash. Detrital minerals are few, and the presence of cristobalite is evidence that dissolution processes were active. Volcanic ash horizons from adjacent environments at Whitewood and Genesee, which were under a greater influence of fluvial activity and fresh water, are composed predominantly of smectite and display a diversity of detrital minerals.

AB Piled foundations are widely used to transfer structural loads through a weak stratum to competent underlying ground. In earthquake-prone areas, these piles have to consider kinematic loading and potential loss of bearing where there is an added liquefaction potential. Earlier practice in parts of Christchurch, New Zealand, did not acknowledge the potential loss of bearing in liquefiable sand layers with numerous instances of driven piles through peat layers bearing on liquefiable sands with consequential damage following the earthquakes of the Canterbury earthquake sequence. Localised instances of screw-type piles installed into liquefiable sands are also evident where the design was driven by vertical structural load specification with torque readings used to confirm bearing capacity. This paper presents a case study of performance of a two-storey 3000 m(2) building complex on piled foundations through peat, where the original buildings were founded on driven piles generally into liquefiable layers and later extensions on screw piles of varying depths. Particular focus is given to an approximate 500 m(2) extension founded on screw piles of varying depths through peat and generally embedded in underlying liquefiable sand that performed surprisingly better than expected, presumably because of a tied-together foundation system.

AB To predict the impacts of climate change, a better understanding is needed of the foundation species that build and maintain biogenic ecosystems. Spartina alterniflora Loisel (smooth cordgrass) is the dominant salt marsh-building plant along the US Atlantic coast. It maintains salt marsh elevation relative to sea level by the accumulation of aboveground biomass, which promotes sediment deposition and belowground biomass, which accretes as peat. Peat accumulation is particularly important in elevation maintenance at high latitudes where sediment supply tends to be limited. Latitudinal variation in S. alterniflora growth was quantified in eight salt marshes from Massachusetts to South Carolina. The hypothesis that allocation to aboveground and belowground biomass is phenotypically plastic was tested with transplant experiments among a subset of salt marshes along this gradient. Reciprocal transplants revealed that northern S. alterniflora decreased allocation to belowground biomass when grown in the south. Some northern plants also died when moved south, suggesting that northern S. alterniflora may be stressed by future warming. Southern plants that were moved north showed phenotypic plasticity in biomass allocation, but no mortality. Belowground biomass also decomposed more quickly in southern marshes. Our results suggest that warming will lead northern S. alterniflora to decrease belowground allocation and that belowground biomass will decompose more quickly, thus decreasing peat accumulation. Gradual temperature increases may allow for adaptation and acclimation, but our results suggest that warming will lower the ability of salt marshes to withstand sea-level rise.

AB The results of studies of the content and stocks of organic carbon in the block "litter soil" of pine ecosystems in Zhytomyr and Chernihiv Polissia are presented. The forest ecosystems are important stabilizers of the carbon cycle as well as stocks of carbon. The components of the forest ecosystem are interconnected by the flows of energy and substances. Binding CO2 in the block of "plant-soil", followed by the transformation of carbon into insoluble humus compounds is of particular importance. In the research area sod - light-podzolic and sod-medium-podzolic soils on fluvioglacial sands are mostly spread. These soils belong to the category of old arable ones. Present here are also peat marsh soils. It is shown that the process of humus accumulation is characterized by low intensity, which is caused by a complex of reasons, in particular, the sandy composition of sod-podzolic soils (particle content < 0,01 mm 7,5 %).The thickness of the profile humus portion is 18 cm. The average content of humus is 0,97 %, and reserves 28,3 t/ha in a 20-cm layer. Similar indicators of carbon are 0,56 % and 16,4 t/ha, respectively. Organic substance of sod-podzolic soils of pine habitats is resistant to mineralization and for a long time is removed from the cycle of substances of the pine ecosystem. The average carbon content in hydromorphic organogenic soils increases to 18,1 % and its stocks are 168,9 t/ha. The ability for mineralization peat soils is lower than that of sod-podzolic soils. So, they have a high carbon sequestration capacity. Pine litter reserves on the average are 30-33 t/ha, and carbon reserves on the average are 12,6 t/ha, with its stable content 40 %.The total carbon reserves in the block "litter soil" of a typical pine ecosystem of Polissia are on average 29 t/ha, with the bulk of them being concentrated in the soil. Considering that highly productive pine forests are formed on the infertile soils of Polissia, their afforestation will not only stop the intensive degradation of soils of Ukraine, but also will increase the deposition of greenhouse gases, which will help to prevent further climate change at the regional level.

AB Dating of five widely spaced (noncoastal) dunes in eastern upper Michigan by optically stimulated luminescence of quartz establishes that eolian sand was last mobilized between ca. 7 and 5.5 ka in the region. Although this interval corresponds to the drier Altithermal-Hypsithermal period, climate alone may not have been sufficiently and to cause dune formation in this area. Instead, it appears that dune formation may also be linked to depressed water tables, associated with outlet-controlled low levels in Lakes Michigan and Superior. Following dune stabilization, peat began to accumulate in interdune areas ca. 4.4 ka.

AB A new test design for the non-axenic submergent aquatic macrophytes Elodea canadensis Michx. and Myriophyllum spicatum L. has been developed for potential use in herbicide toxicity testing. For the non-axenic cultures, the best growth conditions were observed in the Elendt-M4 medium in which no growth of algae or bacteria was observed. Cuttings were placed in beakers containing only the artificial M4 medium or were planted in small beakers containing OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) sediment (5% peat, 75% sand, 20% kaolinite), which were then placed in larger vessels with the M4 medium. The plants were observed for main and secondary shoot length, biomass and root formation within 2-3 weeks of planting. Growth rates were calculated for total plant length and biomass. The variance between the replicates was low throughout the experiment [coefficient of variation (CV) < 26% for total plant length, and between 16 and 40% for biomass]. Relative growth rates based on total plant length were determined as 0.028 and 0.050 per day for M. spicatum in the systems containing M4 medium only and medium plus sediment respectively. Similar results were observed for E. canadensis, with relative growth rates of 0.26 and 0.073 per day in the two test systems. The root-shoot ratio at harvest was greater by a factor of 2-3 for E. canadensis in the M4 medium than in the system containing sediment. However, comparable ratios were observed for M. spicatum in the two test systems. Both growth in total plant length and growth in biomass of the two species have potential as measures of toxicity.

AB High Arctic wetlands, though limited in occurrence, are an important ecological niche, providing the major vegetated areas in an and and cold polar desert environment. These wetlands are often found as patches in the barren landscape. At a few locales which may be ice-wedge polygonal grounds, glacial terrain and zones of recent coastal uplift, wetland occurrence can become extensive, forming a mosaic that comprises patches of different wetland types. Reliable water supply during the thawed season is a deciding factor in wetland sustainability. The sources include meltwater from late-lying snowbanks, localized ground water discharge, streamflow, inundation by lakes and the sea, and for some ice-wedge wetlands, ground-ice melt. Different types of wetlands have their own characteristics, and peat accumulation or diatom depositions are common. The peat cover insulates the wetland from summer heating and encourages permafrost aggradation, with the feedback that a shallow frost table reduces the moisture storage capacity in a thinly thawed layer, which becomes easily saturated. All the wetlands studied have high calcium content since they are formed on carbonate terrain. Coastal wetlands have high salt concentration while snowmelt and ground-ice melt provides dilution. The sustainability of High Arctic wetlands is predicated upon water supply exceeding the losses to evaporation and lateral drainage. Disturbances due to natural causes such as climatic variations, geomorphic changes, or human-induced drainage, can reduce inundation opportunities or increase outflow. Then, the water table drops, the vegetation changes and the peat degrades, leading to the detriment of the wetlands. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Hula Decision Support System (HDSS) is designed to aid Hula site operators in managing groundwater levels in the Hula Lake region of Israel. Groundwater levels are managed by controlling water levels by using adjustable dams in a grid of drainage canals and by the timing and intensity of irrigation. Water levels in the canals are controlled by a set of hydraulic structures. Groundwater levels are to be maintained within a specified range to minimize decomposition and subsidence of the peat soils, ensure year-round green cover of the area, and avoid saturation conditions in the crop root zone, thereby allowing farmers to continue cultivation of their fields. The management module for the HDSS performs optimization with the following two objectives: (1) minimize deviation from the specified groundwater target level, and (2) minimize supply of water from the Jordan River to the Hula drainage canals (water quantity is limited). The second objective is achieved indirectly in the HDSS by determining the dam settings and irrigation quantity and timing over a period of eight weeks and then solving again whenever conditions change. The results are checked by simulation using MODFLOW within the GMS modeling package. The procedure is demonstrated and analyzed.

AB This paper presents the planned design for a new steel road bridge in the Tenagi valley, Kavala, Greece. The plans are for a single span steel truss trough bridge with a span of 67 m over an irrigation channel The new bridge will replace an existing reinforced concrete one that is no longer in service due to excessive rotation of its single pier and deck failure. The major challenge associated with the design of the new bridge is the poor soil characteristics in the region. The soil is composed of peat to a depth of over 200 m. Optimization of the type, shape, and size of the bridge superstructure is critical in order to minimize soil intervention. In this article, the effects of several types of deck (a reinforced concrete deck, a fiber reinforced polymer deck, and a steel deck are considered) on the weight of the steel truss are examined. Shape optimization of the truss is conducted with the truss height as a variable. Beyond minimizing the weight of the bridge, soil improvement techniques such as deep soil mixing and the preloading of embankments must also be implemented to minimize settlement and increase the bearing capacity of the soil.

AB Seedling populations of jojoba are extremely heterogeneous; about 50% of the plants are nonproducing males, and many of the females are low-yielding or are otherwise undesirable. Asexual propagation methods allow the increase and use of only desirable plants. Rooting of stem cuttings is the most commonly used asexual method; however, unsatisfactory results sometimes still occur when using this method, so it requires further refinement. In this study, three factors suspected to play an important role were studied: rooting medium, basal wounding and depth of insertion in the medium. Three media [perlite/vermiculite, 1:1 (vol/vol); peat/perlite/vermiculite, 1:1:1 and peat/perlite, 1:1], wounding vs. not wounding, and insertion of one or two nodes below the surface of the medium were compared. The base (2.5 cm) of each cutting was treated with potassium salt of indole butyric acid, 1000 ppm prior to insertion into the medium, and cuttings were rooted on a heated propagation bench under intermittent mist. The experimental design was a 3 X 2 X 2 factorial and was replicated five times. Sixteen cuttings were used per experimental unit. The study was repeated. Rooting percentage was significantly affected only in the first repetition and then only by media. The peat/perlite medium resulted in significantly less rooting than did the other two media. However, averaged over both repetitions, rooting averaged 74% for perlite/vermiculite, 78% for peat/perlite/vermiculite and 64% for peat/perlite. Depth of insertion and wounding did not affect rooting percent in either repetition of the study. Both deeper insertion and wounding resulted in roots emerging from along a greater length of the stem at the basal end of the cuttings. Cuttings with two nodes inserted into the medium averaged root emergence along a 54% greater length of the stem than those with only one node inserted. With wounding, roots emerged along 17.3 mm of the stem, while without wounding, emergence occurred only along 7.0 mm of the stem. The better root system resulting from wounding and deeper insertion into the medium would Likely result in better performance of the cutting when transplanted to a field.

AB Soil active organic carbon responds quickly to soil disturbances and is a sensitive indicator of early changes in soil organic carbon (SOC). In order to identify the differences in the distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), SOC and their changes as affected by vegetation degradation degree along water gradient in wetland, we analyzed DOC, LFOC, and SOC in the 0-100 cm soil layer under four vegetation degradation degrees: non-degradation (ND), lightly degradation (LD), moderately degradation (MD) and heavily degradation (HD). The results showed that soil DOC, LFOC and SOC in the 0-100 cm layer of ND wetland was significantly higher than the other three degradation levels. DOC, LFOC and SOC contents decreased with increasing soil depth under the four degradation degrees and the contents of soil DOC, LFOC and SOC were mainly concentrated in the soil surface (0-20 cm). The DOC, LFOC, and SOC contents in the 0-20 cm layer under all four degradation levels showed obvious seasonal changes, while the DOC, LFOC, and SOC contents in the 20-100 cm layer showed little fluctuation over the plant growing season. There was a significant positive correlation between soil DOC and SOC, and between LFOC and SOC, with correlation coefficients of 0.948 and 0.911, respectively. There was also a very significant correlation between DOC and LFOC(R-2 = 0.904). Soil DOC and LFOC in the 0-100 cm layer under the four degree of degradation were linearly correlated with SOC. While there was a linear correlation between DOC and LFOC in the non-degradation wetland soils, DOC and LFOC in the three degradation soils correlated exponentially correlated with SOC.

AB The cool temperate climate, dominance of perennial land use, and relatively large proportion of peat and organically rich soils, make the northern European regions to have a large potential of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. However, with predicted global warming soils in these areas may become sources of atmospheric CO2. Quantitative and reliable assessment methods and understanding of the spatial variability of SOC pools are required to make accurate mean estimate of available C and integrate variability into predictive models of SOC reserves and sequestration potential. Advanced analytical methods such as near-infrared spectroscopy and carbon isotope techniques can be used to estimate retention time and C turnover rates in soils. The rehabilitation of peat lands has shown a potential for SOC sequestration ranging from 25 to 45 gCm(-2) yr(-1) in Scandinavian countries. The potential of SOC sequestration in agricultural and forestry ecosystems depends on the land use and management practice adopted. Furthermore, the proven land management practices (e.g. conservation tillage, reduced soil erosion, restoring wetlands and degraded lands) coupled with improved cultivation practices (e.g. judicious fertilizer use, crop rotations and cover crops) can make the soil of this region as C sink.

AB Farmers can play an important role in enhancing the diversity of plant species in ditches, since they carry out most of the management. Little is known about the measures farmers can take to enhance aquatic biodiversity in ditches. Therefore, a field study was set up to determine how dredging, ditch cleaning, and nutrient supply in the adjacent fields affect the floristic values of the ditch vegetation in peat areas. A total of 240 ditches on 84 dairy farms were selected, to establish the effect of ditch cleaning, dredging, and nutrient supply. Generalised linear modelling was used to determine the most relevant factors, and to obtain quantitative relations between those factors and two indices of floristic value. Ditch management, field management, and water management were found to affect the floristic values of the ditch vegetation. Increasing the water depth proved to be the most cost-effective measure. Further improvements can be obtained by choosing certain machines or specific management periods, or reducing the N supply. The effect of the P supply is not yet sufficiently clear. The water boards can enhance floristic values by raising the ditch water table and by lowering the Cl- concentration in the ditches.

AB The paper describes the filter-paper method as an indirect method for the estimation of the pF characteristics. In this method, no direct measurements of soil water potential (pF) are performed, but the latter is determined on the basis of the gravimetric moisture content of the filter paper, which is in contact with the analysed soil samples. Therefore, there is a need to establish a calibration equation that would express the relationship between the value of the soil water potential (pF) and the gravimetric moisture content of the filter paper. The calibration procedure was performed using standard measurement methods of determining pF curves (sand box, pressure plates) and filter paper (Whatman no 42). Based on the research conducted, calibration curves were developed for the filter-paper method, for the analysed sapric (drainic) histosoles, developed from moss and alder peats of medium (hemic) and strong (sapric) degree of decomposition, originating from the mid-basin of the Biebrza river. The proposed calibration curves were presented as 3-degree polynomial equations. The aforementioned equations can be used for the estimation of retention characteristic for sapric (drainic) histosoles, showing similar properties and comparable degree of secondary decomposition of the peat mass.

AB In the current multiplication technique first-generation seed tubers produced in the field by transplanting plants raised on peat in plastic rolls from plants cultured by repetitive multiplication using tip- and stem-cuttings and truncated plants are compared with in vitro micro-plants from the aspect of obtaining optimal-sized, disease-free seed tubers.
   The objective of the study is to compare the dynamics of total plant dry mass and tuber dry mass of field-grown potato plants, and analyse the effect of the year and variety. Two local late-maturing potato varieties, Ants and Vigri, were used in the study. The field experiments were carried out in 2005-2007.
   Significant impact of the multiplication method and experimental year on total plant dry mass and tuber dry mass was observed. The plants multiplied in vitro from micro-cuttings produced lower total dry mass and also lower tuber dry mass per m(2). The plants multiplied by tip- and stem-cuttings as well as truncated plants proved to be more adaptable to unfavourable weather conditions than in vitro plants; in a favourable year, however, the differences were insignificant. In the early phase of growth the ratio of the tuber dry mass to total plant dry mass increased more rapidly in the case of in vitro plants, whereas by the end of the growing season the relevant ratio was similar for all multiplication methods and years.
   All developed multiplication methods are suitable for practical seed potato production in the field and ensure a reasonable potato crop.

AB Determining the temperature sensitivity of terrestrial carbon (C) stores is an urgent priority for predicting future climate feedbacks. A key aspect to solve this long-standing research gap is to determine whether warmer temperatures will increase autotrophic activities leading to greater C storage or promote heterotrophic activities that will drive these systems to become C sources. We experimentally addressed this critical question by subjecting intact plant-soil systems in a UK upland ecosystem to simulated climate warming under natural field conditions. We report the results of a 13-year field-based climate manipulation experiment combining in situ respiration measurements with radiocarbon (C-14) analyses of respired CO2, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soil and the tissue contents of the dominant soil fauna (enchytraeids). We found that warming during the growing season produced the largely expected increases in ecosystem respiration (63%) and leaching of DOC (19%) with no evidence for thermal acclimation or substrate exhaustion over the whole 13-year experimental period. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence to support an increased release of old soil C after more than a decade of simulated climatic change, and indeed, C-14 analyses indicated that warming caused a significant shift towards mineralisation of more recent plant-derived C inputs. Further support came from the radiocarbon analyses of the enchytraeid tissues, which showed a greater assimilation of the more recent (plant-derived) C sources following warming. Therefore, in contrast to subarctic ecosystems, our results suggest that changes in C storage in this UK upland soil are strongly coupled to plant activities and that increasing temperatures will drive the turnover of organic material fixed only within recent years, without resulting in the loss of existing old carbon stores.

AB Despite the general assumption that nitrogen fixed by associated cyanobacteria will be readily utilised for growth by the Sphagnum, no empirical evidence is available in the literature. Therefore the effects of nitrogen transfer from cyanobacteria associated with S. riparium were investigated.
   Cultivation of S. riparium with and without cyanobacteria was performed under laboratory conditions for 57 days.
   We show that nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria associated with Sphagnum mosses, influences moss growth by transfer of fixed nitrogen to the moss. More than 35 % of the nitrogen fixed by cyanobacteria was transferred to the newly formed moss biomass and resulted in an increase in the growth of Sphagnum biomass compared to the controls. The variation in the increase of nitrogen content explained 76 % of the biomass increment.
   Hence, nitrogen fixation will have immediate effect on the carbon fixation by Sphagnum. This shows that factors regulating nitrogen fixation will have a direct effect on the role of Sphagnum dominated ecosystems with respect to carbon cycling.

AB This study investigated the role of hydrology, soils, and trampling in determining the distribution of vegetation in an isolated wetland from 1996 to 1999. Grassy Pond, in Litchfield, New Hampshire, is a seasonally flooded basin marsh situated in sandy soils. It is a depressional wetland consisting of three connected basins; it has no surface-water inlets or outlets. This acidic, low-nutrient wetland contains several rare species and represents an uncommon ecosystem type in New England. A network of wells and piezometers monitored from 1996 to 1999 established that the wetland receives an average of 95.4% of its growing season inputs from precipitation and the rest from shallow ground water flowing through the wetland; as a result, it experiences large fluctuations in water levels. Vegetation in the wetland fell into five major elevation zones. Variation in plant diversity within each zone, and differences between adjacent zones, result in part from differences in depth of organic layer, trampling by hikers, all-terrain vehicles, and native wildlife, and the extent of water-level fluctuations. Several of the low basin species are more likely to be found in trampled areas. Shrub invasion of the open basin areas is prevented by trampling in some areas and by high water levels in others. Variability in hydrology resulted in temporal, as well as spatial, variability in the plant community, as dry years yielded significantly greater diversity, including a large increase in tree seedlings. Both hydrologic variability and trampling are external factors that explain a significant portion of the variation in vegetation on a large scale and connect this geographically isolated wetland to the surrounding landscape. On a smaller scale, however, autogenic forces related to soil formation and plant species interactions may be more important in explaining the plant diversity in the wetland.

AB Rivers can be treated as transportation networks which supply or collect and remove certain resources from the surrounding environment. A positive feedback between environment and river network both reshapes the configuration of the terrain and produces dynamically stable web of river channels. Anastomosing rivers exemplify such interactions very clearly. In case of this specific type of river, nutrients carried by water disseminate to the surrounding soil and stimulate growth of peat-forming plants. Vertical accumulation of peats changes the shape of terrain and influence river network. We present a model of anastomosing river system based on Cellular Automata paradigm. Principal phenomena that contribute to evolution of such a river system are encoded as rules of local interactions. We discuss extensively the parameters and their influence on simulation results.

AB Soil characteristics in palaeosols are an important source of information on past climate and vegetation. Fingerprinting of soil organic matter (SOM) by pyrolysis-GC/MS is assessed as a proxy for palaeo-reconstruction in the complex of humic layers on top of the Rocourt pedosequence in the Veldwezelt-Hezerwater outcrop (Belgian loess belt). The fingerprints of the extractable SOM of different soil units are related to total organic carbon content, delta C-13 and grain-size analysis. Combined results indicate that the lower unit of the humic complex reflects a stable soil surface, allowing SOM build-up, intensive microbial activity and high decomposition. Higher in the profile, decomposition and microbial activity decrease. This is supported by a shift in the isotopic signal, an increased U ratio and evidence of wildfires. Although the chemical composition of the extracted SOM differed greatly from recent SOM, fingerprinting yielded detailed new information on SOM degree of decomposition and microbial contribution, allowing the reconstruction of palaeo-environmental conditions during pedogenesis.

AB Increase of the share of high-quality seedlings in the total production on the one hand enhances the production efficiency of the nursery production, and on the other hand improves the probability for successful planting in the field. The quality of the seedlings after the first growing season is related to the quality of the seeds used. In the tree species with large seeds, like pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), quality is related to the size of the seed, i.e. the amount of stored nutrients. Therefore, the aim of this contribution is to evaluate the effect of acorn size on the morphological development of pedunculate oak seedlings during the first growing season under contrasting light regimes.
   In total, 891 visually healthy acorns collected in the certified seed stand were planted in the "Bosnaplast" containers filled with peat (Figure 1). Part of the containers were kept in the shade of about 10 % of full light during the whole experiment. Before sowing, diameter; weight and length was measured on subsample of 200 acorns. Regression analysis showed that the acorn mass as the most important predictor of the nutrient content much more depends on the acorn diameter, than on the acorn length (Figure 2). Therefore, three acorn size classes were formed according to distribution of the acorn diameters: small acorns (<= 16 mm of diameter), medium-sized acorns (16,1 mm to 17,9 mm of diameter) and large acorns (>= 18 mm of diameter). During the sowing, acorns were measured for diameter and grouped into three classes of acorn size. Position of each acorn was recorded within the container and each container was labeled to facilitate the connection between the measurements of the acorn size and the subsequent measurements of the emerged seedlings. Subsample of 25 seedlings was removed from the experiment with fully developed leaves for detailed measurements of leaf area, and allocation patterns of dry biomass into three plant compartments: leaf root, and stein. After the first growing season, height and root collar diameter were measured on all emerged seedlings.
   Effect of acorn size and light regime on morphological features of one-year old seedlings of pedunculate oak were examined with the analysis of variance. Following morphological features of seedlings were tested: height (Figure 3A and Table 1) and root collar diameter (Figure 3B and Table 1) of the seedlings, leaf area (Figure 4A and Table 2) and specific leaf area (Figure 4B and Table 2) of the seedlings, dry weight (Figure 5A and Table 3) and ratio of aboveground:underground dry weight of the seedlings (Figure 5B and Table 3).
   In seedlings grown in full sunlight increase in the acorn size resulted in the increase in average height and root collar diameters of the seedlings, average leaf area of the seedlings, and seedlings total dry weight. Specific leaf area was, on the other hand, smaller in seedlings from larger acorns. For the seedlings in the shade, light was the decisive factor influencing their morphological development, but still the seedlings from larger acorns were higher and had larger root collar diameters compared to the seedlings from smaller acorns.
   According to the results obtained in this research, it is safe to say that there is enough space for the improvements in the nursery production of pedunculate oak seedlings by taking into account the size of the acorns. However further detailed research efforts are needed to deduce final conclusions and recommendations for the practical nursery production.

AB Botanical microfossils, macroremains and oribatid mites of a Weichselian interstadial deposit in the central Netherlands point to a temporary, sub-arctic wetland in a treeless landscape. Radiocarbon dates and OSL dates show an age between ca. 54.6 and 46.6 ka cal BP. The vegetation succession, starting as a peat-forming wetland that developed into a lake, might well be linked with a Dansgaard-Oeschger climatic cycle. We suggest that during the rapid warming at the start of a D-O cycle, relatively low areas in the landscape became wetlands where peat was formed. During the more gradual temperature decline that followed, evaporation diminished; the wetlands became inundated and lake sediments were formed. During subsequent sub-arctic conditions the interstadial deposits were covered with wind-blown sand. Apart from changes in effective precipitation also the climate-related presence and absence of permafrost conditions may have played a role in the formation of the observed sedimentological sequence from sand to peat, through lacustrine sediment, with coversand on top. The Wageningen sequence may correspond with D-O event 12, 13 or 14. Some hitherto not recorded microfossils were described and illustrated.

AB The large river swamps of Louisiana have complex topography and hydrology, characterized by black willow (Salix nigra) dominance on accreting alluvial sediments and vast areas of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) deepwater swamps with highly organic substrates. Seedling survival of these two wetland tree species is influenced by their growth rate in relation to the height and duration of annual flooding in riverine environments. This study examines the interactive effects of substrate, hydroperiod, and nutrients on growth rates of black willow and baldcypress seedlings. In a greenhouse experiment with a split-split-plot design, 1-year seedlings of black willow and baldcypress were subjected to two nutrient treatments (unfertilized versus fertilized), two hydroperiods (continuously flooded versus twice daily flooding/draining), and two substrates (sand versus commercial peat mix). Response variables included height, diameter, lateral branch count, biomass, and root:stem ratio. Black willow growth in height and diameter, as well as all biomass components, were significantly greater in peat substrate than in sand. Black willow showed a significant hydroperiod-nutrient interaction wherein fertilizer increased stem and root biomass under drained conditions, but flooded plants did not respond to fertilization. Baldcypress diameter and root biomass were higher in peat than in sand, and the same two variables increased with fertilization in flooded as well as drained treatments. These results can be used in Louisiana wetland forest models as inputs of seedling growth and survival, regeneration potential, and biomass accumulation rates of black willow and baldeypress.

AB Identifying the mechanisms that drive invasions of open habitats by woody species is critical for preserving diverse savannas. Trees can promote the establishment of bird-dispersed woody plant species in savannas by reducing dispersal limitation. Previous work in wet pine savannas has shown that densities of bird-dispersed shrubs are higher and species richness of herbaceous species, most of which are not bird-dispersed, is lower in areas near trees. To test the hypothesis that shrub seedling density in wet pine savannas was limited by dispersal and thus the availability of perches for seed-dispersing birds, seed traps and artificial perches were placed near and away from pines. To measure fire-induced mortality of trees and shrubs, Pinus elliottii juveniles and shrub seedlings that had emerged during a fire-free interval were quantified before and after fires. Trees provided perches for birds that dispersed shrubs, thereby reducing dispersal limitation of shrubs. Significantly more seeds of the shrubs, Ilex glabra and L vomitoria, were encountered in seed traps at the bases of P. elliottii than in areas away from trees in two consecutive years. Seedlings of woody species with fleshy fruits occurred more frequently at the bases of artificial perches than away from perches, and the effect of the perches on seedling density was greater away from trees. Eight- and nine-year periods without fire were not long enough for the majority (>99%) of post-fire recruits of P elliottii to grow large enough to survive growing-season fires. A small but greater fraction of shrub seedlings (10%) survived the fires. We argue that periodic fires are sufficient to preclude further invasion of wet pine savannas by P. elliottii, expansion of shrub thickets, and associated declines in plant diversity.

AB We synthesize existing evidence on the ecological history of the Florida Everglades since its inception similar to 7 ka (calibrated kiloannum) and evaluate the relative impacts of sea level rise, climate variability, and human alteration of Everglades hydrology on wetland plant communities. Initial freshwater peat accumulation began between 6 and 7 ka on the platform underlying modern Florida Bay when sea level was similar to 6.2 m below its current position. By 5 ka, sawgrass and waterlily peats covered the area bounded by Lake Okeechobee to the north and the Florida Keys to the south. Slower rates of relative sea level rise similar to 3 ka stabilized the south Florida coastline and initiated transitions from freshwater to mangrove peats near the coast. Hydrologic changes in freshwater marshes also are indicated similar to 3 ka. During the last similar to 2 ka, the Everglades wetland was affected by a series of hydrologic fluctuations related to regional to global-scale fluctuations in climate and sea level. Pollen evidence indicates that regional-scale droughts lasting two to four centuries occurred similar to 1 ka and similar to 0.4 ka, altering wetland community composition and triggering development of characteristic Everglades habitats such as sawgrass ridges and tree islands. Intercalation of mangrove peats with estuarine muds similar to 1 ka indicates a temporary slowing or stillstand of sea level. Although sustained droughts and Holocene sea level rise played large roles in structuring the greater Everglades ecosystem, twentieth century reductions in freshwater flow, compartmentalization of the wetland, and accelerated rates of sea level rise had unprecedented impacts on oxidation and subsidence of organic soils, changes/loss of key Everglades habitats, and altered distribution of coastal vegetation.

AB The younger (post 4000 cal BC) part of the water-level curve for the eastern Flevo area, central Netherlands runs below the relative mean sea-level (MSL) curve for the western and northern Netherlands (Mededelingen Rijks Geologische Dienst 36(l) (1982) 93pp). We investigated if this difference can be attributed to (i) root rejuvenation of the bulk-dated basal peat samples on which the curve for the eastern Flevo area is based and/or (ii) underestimation of the water depth in which the dated peat accumulated. It appears that these potential sources of error did not influence significantly the results obtained by Roeleveld and Gotje (De Holocene laagveenontwikkeling in de randzone van de Nederlandse kustvlakte (Noordoostpolder), unpublished Ph.D. Thesis, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1993, pp. 76-86). On the basis of new and recently published water-level data from the eastern and southwestern Flevo area we confirm, refine, and tentatively extend the water-level rise reconstruction by Roeleveld and Gotje and establish a relative MSL-trend curve for the central Netherlands. The systematic age differences of our radiocarbon dates on various fractions of four new basal peat samples from the eastern Flevo area support the interpretation by Roeleveld and Gotje that the younger part of the 1982-MSL curve may be based on basal peat samples (all from the Rotterdam area), that have been dated 100-200yr too old. If this interpretation is correct, the fact that the relative MSL curve for the central Netherlands lies below the 1982-MSL curve cannot be interpreted to indicate less crustal subsidence for the Rhine-Meuse delta, as predicted by geophysical modeling (J. Quat. Sci. 17 (2002) 535). (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB Organic waste, the predominant component of global solid waste, has never been higher, resulting in increased landfilling, incineration, and open dumping that releases greenhouse gases and toxins that contribute to global warming and environmental pollution. The need to create and adopt sustainable closed-loop systems for waste reduction and valorization is critical. Using organic waste as a feedstock, gasification and pyrolysis systems can produce biooil, syngas, and thermal energy, while reducing waste mass by as much as 85 & ndash;95% through conversion into biochar, a valuable byproduct with myriad uses from soil conditioning to bioremediation and carbon sequestration. Here, we present a novel case study detailing the circular economy of gasification biochar in Singapore's Gardens by the Bay. Biochar produced from horticultural waste within the Gardens was tested as a partial peat moss substitute in growing lettuce, pak choi, and pansy, and found to be a viable substitute for peat moss. At low percentages of 20 & ndash;30% gasification biochar, fresh weight yields for lettuce and pak choi were comparable to or exceeded those of plants grown in pure peat moss. The biochar was also analyzed as a potential additive to concrete, with a 2% biochar mortar compound found to be of suitable strength for non-structural functions, such as sidewalks, ditches, and other civil applications. These results demonstrate the global potential of circular economies based on local biochar creation and on-site use through the valorization of horticultural waste via gasification, generating clean, renewable heat or electricity, and producing a carbon-neutral to-negative byproduct in the form of biochar. They also indicate the potential of scaled-up pyrolysis or gasification systems for a circular economy in waste management.

AB Emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from Arctic wetlands have been studied extensively, though little is known about the ecology and community structure of methanogenic archaea that catalyze the methane production. As part of a project addressing microbial transformations of methane in Arctic wetlands, we studied archaeal communities in two wetlands (Solvatnet and Stuphallet) at Spitsbergen, Norway (78 degrees N) during two summer seasons. Directly extracted peat community DNA and enrichment cultures of methanogenic archaea were analyzed by nested PCR combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and subsequent sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Sequences affiliated with Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanosaeta and Group T.3b of the uncultured crenarchaeota were detected at both sites. Sequences affiliated with Methanosarcina were recovered only from the site Solvatnet, while sequences affiliated with the euryarchaeotal clusters Rice Cluster II and Sediment I were detected only at the site Stuphallet. The phylogenetic affiliation of the recovered sequences suggested a potential of both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis at both sites. At Solvatnet, there were clear temporal trends in the archaeal community structure over the Arctic summer season. The archaeal community composition was significantly affected by factors influencing the activity of the overall bacterial community, as measured by in situ emissions Of CO2. Methane emissions at both sites were influenced more by peat temperatures and thaw depth than by the archaeal community structure. Enrichment cultures for methanogenic archaea determined that most of the methanogens detected directly in peat could grow in culture at 10 degrees C. Culture based biases were indicated in later enrichment steps by the abundant growth of a Methanosarcina strain that was not detected directly in peat samples.

AB Ecosystems that naturally burn at short intervals nonetheless exhibit some variability in fire-return intervals. Prolonged fire suppression and exclusion, however, potentially increase this variability beyond some tolerable threshold. Therefore frequent fires at regular intervals are often argued as necessary to maintain herbaceous plant diversity in pine savannas. We measured plant community composition after eight- and nine-year fire-free intervals, preceded by 15 years of fires every three years, at two wet pine savanna sites (Wolf Branch and Sandy Creek) in southern Mississippi. Species composition was quantified after the frequent-fire period (1997), after eight years without fire at Sandy Creek and nine years without fire at Wolf Branch, and for two seasons after a prescribed bum in 2004 at both sites. Monte Carlo randomization tests revealed significant changes in species composition at both study sites. However, most changes were temporary. Numerous herbaceous species appeared to be significantly less common at the end of the fire-free interval, but this decline was reversed by the 2004 fire. Only Eriocaulon compressum, Dichromena latifolia, Polygala cruciata, and Rhexia lutea declined and remained infrequent after the 2004 fire. A few herbaceous species (e.g., Aristida palustris, Zigadenus glaberrimus, and Carphephorus pseudoliatris) benefited from the fire-free interval. The majority of long-lived species responded with increased flowering after the fire, and in some cases, increased flowering was delayed until the second growing season after fire. We conclude that most species in wet pine savannas can withstand periodic extended intervals between fires, and a few may even benefit from such variability. We suggest that adaptations such as fire-regulated dormancy and plasticity enable most plants in this system to tolerate naturally varying fire frequencies.

AB Despite the recognized organic carbon (OC) sequestration potential of mangrove forests, the ongoing climate change and anthropogenic disturbances pose a great threat to these ecosystems. However, we currently lack the ability to mechanically understand and predict the consequences of such impacts, primarily because mechanisms underlying OC stabilization in these ecosystems remain elusive. Research into OC stabilization has focused on terrestrial soils and marine sediments for decades, overlooking the vegetated coastal ecosystems including mangroves. In terrestrial soils and marine sediments, it is widely accepted that OC stabilization is the integrated consequence of OM's inherent recalcitrance, physical protection, and interactions with minerals and metals. However, related discussion is rarely done in mangrove soils, and recalcitrance of roots and high net ecosystem production (high primary production and low heterotrophic respiration) have been considered as a primary OC sequestration mechanism in mangrove peat and mineral soils, respectively. This review presents the available information on the mechanisms underlying OC stabilization in mangrove soils and highlights research questions that warrant further investigation. Primary OC stabilization mechanisms differ between mangrove peat and mineral soils. In mangrove mineral soils, physico-chemical stabilization processes are important, yet grossly understudied OC stabilization mechanisms. In mangrove peat, recalcitrance of mangrove roots and the inhibition of phenoloxidase under the anoxic condition may be the primary OC stabilization mechanisms. Salinity-induced OC immobilization likely plays a role in both type of soils. Finally, this review argues that belowground production and allochthonous inputs in mangrove forests are likely underestimated. More studies are needed to constrain C budgets to explain the enigma that mangrove OC keeps accumulating despite much higher decomposition (especially by large lateral exports) than previously considered.

AB Adding biochar to soil can change soil properties and subsequently affect plant growth, but this effect can vary because of different feedstocks and methods (e.g., pyrolysis or gasification) used to create the biochar. Growth and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) of leguminous plants can be improved with rhizobia inoculation that fosters nodule development. Thus, this factorial greenhouse study examined the effects of two types of biochar (i.e., pyrolysis and gasification) added at a rate of 5% (v:v) to a peat-based growth substrate and rhizobia inoculation (yes or no) onRobinia pseudoacacia(black locust) seedlings supplied with(15)NH(4)(15)NO(3). Seedling and nodule growth, nitrogen (N) content, and delta N-15 x 1000 were evaluated after 3 months. While addition of biochar without inoculation had no effect on seedling growth, inoculation with rhizobia increased seedling growth, BNF, and N status. Inoculated seedlings had reduced delta N-15, indicating that N provided via fertilization was being diluted by N additions through BNF. Biochar type and inoculation interacted to affect seedling growth. Combining inoculation with either biochar type increased seedling leaf, stem, and total biomass, whereas gasifier biochar and inoculation improved all seedling growth variables and nodule biomass.

AB Reducing decomposition and mineralization of organic matter by increasing groundwater levels is a common approach to reduce plant nutrient availability in many peat meadow restoration projects. The soil community is the main driver of these processes, but how community composition is affected by peat meadow restoration is largely unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether restoration induced changes could lead to altered decomposition and mineralization rates. We determined soil community composition in restored peat meadows with different groundwater levels and soil pH. This composition was subsequently used in food web model calculations of C and N mineralization rates to assess whether differences in soil community composition may have contributed to differences in decomposition and mineralization rates observed between these meadows.
   Community composition of micro-organisms, Collembola and Enchytraeidae differed considerably between meadows and were correlated with differences in groundwater levels and soil pH. Collembolan and enchytraeid species from wet and neutral environments were more abundant at meadows with higher groundwater levels. Lower fungal to bacterial PLFA ratios and higher numbers of protozoa indicated an increased importance of the bacterial part of the food web at meadows with higher groundwater levels. Food web model calculations suggested that the observed changes in community composition would lead to higher rates of C and N mineralization at meadows with high groundwater levels. Results from modeling were consistent with field measurements of C mineralization, but not with measurements of N mineralization.
   We conclude that understanding changes in soil community composition in response to specific restoration measures may help us to better understand ecosystem responses to wetland restoration schemes, especially regarding soil biogeochemical processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Marshes in the urban Jamaica Bay Estuary, New York, USA are disappearing at an average rate of 13 ha/yr, and multiple stressors (e.g., wastewater inputs, dredging activities, groundwater removal, and global warming) may be contributing to marsh losses. Among these stressors, wastewater nutrients are suspected to be an important contributing cause of marsh deterioration. We used census data, radiometric dating, stable nitrogen isotopes, and soil surveys to examine the temporal relationships between human population growth and soil nitrogen; and we evaluated soil structure with computer-aided tomography, surface elevation and sediment accretion trends, carbon dioxide emissions, and soil shear strength to examine differences among disappearing (Black Bank and Big Egg) and stable marshes (JoCo). Radiometric dating and nitrogen isotope analyses suggested a rapid increase in human wastewater nutrients beginning in the late 1840s, and a tapering off beginning in the 1930s when wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were first installed. Current WWTPs nutrient loads to Jamaica Bay are approximately 13 995 kg N/d and 2767 kg P/d. At Black Bank, the biomass and abundance of roots and rhizomes and percentage of organic matter on soil were significantly lower, rhizomes larger in diameter, carbon dioxide emission rates and peat particle density significantly greater, and soil strength significantly lower compared to the stable JoCo Marsh, suggesting Black Bank has elevated decomposition rates, more decomposed peat, and highly waterlogged peat. Despite these differences, the rates of accretion and surface elevation change were similar for both marshes, and the rates of elevation change approximated the long term relative rate of sea level rise estimated from tide gauge data at nearby Sandy Hook, New Jersey. We hypothesize that Black Bank marsh kept pace with sea level rise by the accretion of material on the marsh surface, and the maintenance of soil volume through production of larger diameter rhizomes and swelling (dilation) of waterlogged peat. JoCo Marsh kept pace with sea-level rise through surface accretion and soil organic matter accumulation. Understanding the effects of multiple stressors, including nutrient enrichment, on soil structure, organic matter accumulation, and elevation change will better inform management decisions aimed at maintaining and restoring coastal marshes.

AB The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and related humic acids (HAs) extracted from the soils of field plots were investigated after 8 years of annual paddy (Oryza sativa L.) and upland maize (Zea mays L.) rotation with various fertilizations. Seven fertilization treatments were selected: Ck (no inputs); Chem (chemical fertilizer of NPK); Comp (swine compost); Comp + 33% of Chem N rate; Comp + 67% of Chem N rate; GM (legume green manure) + 33% of Chem N rate; and peat + 33% of Chem N rate. Organic and inorganic nitrogen inputs of six treatments were equivalent with respect of nitrogen content, but Comp, GM, and peat treatments were complemented with various amounts of inorganic N. After harvest of the eighth paddy crop, surface soil samples collected from the plots were subjected to soil characterizations and extraction of humic substances, which were used for chemical, spectroscopic (FTIR, C-13 NMR, ESR, X-ray diffractometry), delta C-13, and C-14 dating analyses. The yields of HAs extracted from the seven treatments were significantly different. Treatment containing persistent organic compound such as the peat + 33% N treatment increased the humification process in topsoils and produced higher yield of HA. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that fertilization treatments changed the functional groups, alkyl C, crystalline characteristics, and delta C-13 ratios of HAs and turnover rate of SOC considerably. The SOC of the peat + 33% N treatment had the highest mean residence time of 3100 years. Various fertilizer treatments are correlated with turnover rate of SOC and related HAs, which are associated with concerned carbon sequestration as well as mitigation of CO2 emission in the soil environment.

AB Many of the estuaries of the Pacific Northwest of the U.S.A. and Canada contain stratigraphic sequences typified by alternating peat-mud couplers. Recent studies in this region interpret such couplets as the product of repeated large (magnitude 8 or 9) earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone. The resultant pattern of land-level movements is described by a model, the 'earthquake deformation cycle', of coseismic land subsidence followed by land uplift during interseismic strain accumulation. However, peat-mud couplets similar to those recorded in the Pacific Northwest are found on other less tectonically active temperate-latitude coasts, such as northwest Europe and the Atlantic coast of the U.S.A., where they have been interpreted as the product of non-seismic coastal processes. In this paper we apply the methods and scientific framework common to sea-level investigations in northwest Europe to a sequence of peat-mud couplets recorded in the lower Johns River, an estuary in southern Washington, to provide a test of the 'earthquake deformation cycle'. Stratigraphic investigations of the intertidal sediments along the lower Johns River, using lithological, pollen, diatom and foraminiferal data, show evidence for eight coastal submergence events during the last 5000 years. To evaluate the 'earthquake deformation cycle' we assess the lateral extent of peat-mud couplets, the synchroneity of submergence, the presence of tsunami deposits accompanying submergence, and the suddenness and amount of submergence. Each submergence is shown to be accompanied by changes in coastal sedimentation broadly commensurate with those predicted by the 'earthquake deformation cycle', demonstrating the continued intermittent seismic activity of the Cascadia subduction zone throughout the mid and late-Holocene. Quantitative analyses of contemporary and fossil biostratigraphic data, using TWINSPAN and Detrended Correspondence Analysis, enable us to estimate the magnitude of submergence accompanying each peat-mud couplet. One event was accompanied by submergence of about 1.5 m or more, four events by intermediate submergence of about 1+/-0.5 m, and a further three events by submergence of <0.5 m. There is evidence for non seismic relative sea-level rise prior to two of the eight submergence events, but for at least the last 3500 years the magnitude of relative sea-level rise has been less than the combined influence of sediment accretion following submergence and interseismic land uplift.

AB Global numerous wetlands are the most productive ecosystem and have high carbon sequestration potential to mitigate increasing CO(2)in the atmosphere. However, few are available on estimating average carbon sequestration rates by global wetlands (Carbon(sq)) at century timescale. In this article, Carbon(sq)data of 473 wetland soil/sediment cores from the literatures were collected in detail by the meta-analysis method. These cores were no more than 300 years old and spanned a latitudinal range from 33.6 degrees S to 69.7 degrees N. Globally, the average Carbon(sq)was 185.2 g/(m(2)center dot yr) regardless of wetland types. Carbon(sq)varied remarkably between wetland types and ranked as an order of salt marsh (247.7 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > mangrove (229.8 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > freshwater marsh (196.7 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > peatland (76.9 g/(m(2)center dot yr)). Carbon(sq)was positively related to mean annual temperature (AMT) and annual precipitation (Pre). Nitrogen was the most common and primary factor controlling Carbon(sq)regardless of wetland types.

AB Two novel carbon-based Ni/Fe catalysts were developed and tested for catalytic decomposition of ammonia into N-2 and H-2. These catalysts were prepared using a mesoporous activated carbon (AC) support derived from a Canadian peat by H3PO4 activation. The newly developed catalysts proved to be highly active for ammonia decomposition. The conversion of 2000 ppm NH3 diluted in helium over the Fe catalyst reached as high as 90% at 750 degrees C and at the space velocity of 45,000 h(-1), compared with only about 15% with the activated carbon alone without metal loading. The new catalyst of Fe/AC was also much more active than the Fe catalyst supported on a commercial activated carbon reported previously. In addition, the new Fe/Ni catalysts showed superior performance with respect to their resistance to catalyst deactivation. Both catalysts remained active as the reaction time increased up to 10 h without showing a sign of deactivation. Fresh and spent catalysts were characterized by XRD and XPS. A cycle mechanism, involving both metal phosphides and metal nitrides, was proposed for the NH3 decomposition reactions over these new Fe/Ni catalysts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Late Pleistocene and Holocene landscape evolution around Lake Sulivan, Falkland Islands, South Atlantic, is assessed using morphological, stratigraphical, paleoecological and C-14-dating evidence. Data indicate a complex landscape history involving frost-related activity, ventifact development, growth and degradation of peat terrain, expansion and contraction of lakes, and the development, stabilisation and subsequent reworking of alluvial and aeolian sand bodies. Late Pleistocene cold conditions favoured production of sandy diamicts on hillslopes, and ventifacts on outcrops and blockfield clasts. Lateglacial climatic amelioration was marked by early growth of peat (ca 16,500 cal. yr BP). Since then, peat accumulation, changes in lake areas and depths, and alluvial and/or aeolian sand deposition have been recurring and dominant features of landscape change which throughout the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene may have been a response to near-synchronous climatic fluctuations along the South America Antarctica axis. Marked landscape changes around Lake Sulivan coincided with intervals of glacier readvance in South America and South Georgia at ca 3200-1900 and 700-100 cal. yr BP: with lower lake levels and aeolian sand transport from exposed lakebeds and shorelines implying greater aridity in the Falklands than at present.

AB Monoliths of two contrasting vegetation types, a species-rich grassland on a brown earth soil over limestone and a species-poor community on a peaty gley, were transferred to solardomes and grown under ambient (350 mu l l(-1)) and elevated (600 mu l l(-1)) CO2 for 2 yr. Shoot biomass was unaltered but root biomass increased by 40-50% under elevated CO2. Root production was increased by elevated CO2 in the peat soil, measured both as instantaneous and cumulative rates, but only the latter measure was increased in the limestone soil. Root growth was stimulated more at 6 cm depth than at 10 cm in the limestone soil. Turnover was faster under elevated CO2 in the peat soil, but there was only a small effect on turnover in the limestone soil. Elevated CO, reduced nitrogen concentration in roots and might have increased mycorrhizal colonization. Respiration rate was correlated with N concentration, and was therefore lower in roots grown at elevated CO2. Estimates of the C budget of the two communities, based upon root production and on net C uptake, suggest that C sequestration in the peat soil increases by c. 0.2 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) (= 2 t ha yr(-1)) under elevated CO2.

AB The distribution of archaeal isoprenoidal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (isoGDGTs) has been increasingly used to characterize the archaeal community and to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental change. However, except for temperature, other environmental factors controlling the distribution of isoGDGTs remain to be explored. Environmental factors generally vary with depth along peat and soil profiles (PP and SP), which can provide unique opportunities to determine the impact of factors other than temperature on the distribution of archaeal ether lipids (AEL) in these settings. Here, we investigated the changes in AEL in two PPs and two red (ferralsol) SPs from southern China and determined the relationship of their distributions with peat and soil depth. The isoGDGT distribution in the two PPs and two SPs all show a significant dependence on depth. Crenarchaeol, which is likely to be produced by Thaumarchaeota, dominates in the upper parts of PPs and SPs, whereas GDGT-0 or isoGDGTs containing cyclopentyl moieties are the most abundant compounds in the deeper parts of these profiles. The change in the AEL distribution can be best characterized by %Cren (the proportion of crenarchaeol in total isoGDGTs) and MI (Methane Index), which are closely related to the water content in PPs and SPs. This suggests that %Cren and MI have potential for tracing the water content and, in turn, the redox conditions in paleosols and peats. The most remarkable differences in the AEL between PPs and SPs are the increased abundance of AEL, e.g., GDGT-5 (isoGDGTs with five cyclopentyl moieties), butanetriol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (BDGTs), H-shaped isoGDGTs, methylated H-shaped isoGDGTs (Me-H-GDGTs) and the decreased abundance of hydroxylated isoGDGTs (OH-GDGTs) with depth in the two PPs, whereas these lipids are absent from the two SPs. This implies that the former group of lipids is likely derived from anaerobic archaea whereas OH-GDGTs and crenarchaeol are primarily of Thaumarchaeotal origin. The response of AEL to in situ environmental variables in the PPs and SPs reveals that the living archaea reside in the deep SPs and PPs and thus caution should be taken when applying these lipids to the highresolution palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.

AB The Junggar coal basin, with enormous coal reserves, is one of the largest coal basins in Xinjiang Province, Northwest China. According to the exploration data, there is one to dozens of workable coal seams developed in the Xishanyao Formation of Middle Jurassic across the whole basin, with the maximum accumulated coal thickness of over 100 m. Ninety-six bulk coal samples from six exploration boreholes in the Southern and Eastern Junggar Coalfields were collected to investigate the coal qualities of the Junggar coals. The mineralogical characteristics of the studied coals were determined by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and geochemical analyses are performed by means of inductively-coupled plasma atomic-emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The Eastern and Southern Junggar bituminous coals are all characterized by low ash yields, low S contents, and low mineral contents. Furthermore, the concentrations of most major and trace elements in both the Eastern and Southern Junggar coals are relatively low with respect to other Chinese and worldwide coals, with the exceptions of Sr and Ba. The results show that elements including K, Li, Ti, Sc, V. Cr, Ga, Rb, Zr, Pb, and rare earth elements (REEs), have aluminosilicate affinities. Ca-bearing and Fe-bearing carbonate affinities are deduced for Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Sr, and Ba. Sulfur (Fe), Zn, Pb, Cu, and As show a partial sulfide affinity in some coals. An apatite and/or crandallite affinity is deduced from relatively high correlation of P. Sr, and Ba. The very high coal quality of Junggar coals is attributed to very low detrital supply in very stable shallow-lake sedimentary facies during peat accumulation. Slight differences of peat bog accumulation rate, water table, and oxidizing-reducing condition account for the merging and splitting of coal seams in different coal exploration areas and the slight differences of mineral. S, ash, and trace element contents. In summary, the Eastern and Southern Junggar coals with very enormous reserves are characterized by high quality, which is significantly and environmentally relevant to coal combustion by-products (CCPs) and potential emissions of gaseous pollutants/particulate matter during the large coal consumption in pulverized coal combustion power stations in Xinjiang Province. The high coal quality of the Junggar coals is expected to generate CCPs that can be reused for various purposes with low environmental threat. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We describe a model that estimates the social benefits of carbon (C) sequestered in plantation Sitka spruce in Great Britain. Final net present values (NPV, base year = 2003) resulting from plausible variations in model parameters are calculated. The discount rate, social value of C, timber yield, rate of gain into live wood, length of rotation, lifetime of products, amount of C displaced by products and the changes in C flux on afforested peat soils are the most influential model components. The study predicts that C fluxes in actively managed forests in second or subsequent rotations or planted on peat soils will tend to have low or (on average) negative NPV. (C) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum are suitable as bio-indicators of heavy metal pollution in the atmosphere. In the present study the dusting-system "Dust Feed Chamber" was developed to investigate the heavy metal accumulation (Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni, Sb, Tl, Zn) of Sphagnum palustre within the context of dust application experiments. The results show that moist Sphagnum accumulates heavy metals, adhering at particles, much more effectively than dry one. Furthermore, correlations were good up to very good to the added heavy metal contents of the reference dust. Compared to field exposures (according to VDI 3957 Part 17), the very short contact time between moss and particulates at much higher heavy metal concentrations remains open to criticism.

AB The present study investigated controls on the formation of Wakkerstroom Vlei, an similar to 1 000 ha unchannelled valley-bottom wetland on the South African Highveld. Along the uppermost and lowermost reaches of the wetland, where dolerite outcrops occur along the main valley, hydrogeomorphic features typical of geological control on wetland formation are present, including a meandering river channel, oxbow lakes and <3 m deep organic-poor alluvial fill. Along the main body of the wetland, however, floodplain features are absent, alluvial fill is up to 4.5 m deep and contains up to 2 m deep accumulations of peat. These characteristics deviate from the traditional model of dolerite control on wetland formation described by several other studies on Highveld wetland systems. The formation of Wakkerstroom Vlei has been controlled by a combination of geological, geomorphic and biotic factors, including the formation of a relatively wide, gently sloping valley along the middle reaches, creating accommodation for floodplain wetland formation, followed by impoundment of the main channel by laterally impinging alluvial fans, and the dense growth of robust vegetation, which has promoted flood-out of the main channel and peat formation. This knowledge has been important for identifying catchment and wetland land-use practices that threaten the longevity of Wakkerstroom Vlei.

AB We examined the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil carbon decomposition in an experimental anaerobic wetland system. Pots containing either bare C-4-derived soil or the C-3 sedge Scirpus olneyi planted in C-4-derived soil were incubated in greenhouse chambers at either ambient or twice-ambient atmospheric CO2. We measured CO2 flux from each pot, quantified soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization using delta C-13, and determined root and shoot biomass. SOM mineralization increased in response to elevated CO2 by 83-218% (P < 0.0001). In addition, soil redox potential was significantly and positively correlated with root biomass (P = 0.003). Our results (1) show that there is a positive feedback between elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and wetland SOM decomposition and (2) suggest that this process is mediated by the release of oxygen from the roots of wetland plants. Because this feedback may occur in any wetland system, including peatlands, these results suggest a limitation on the size of the carbon sink presented by anaerobic wetland soils in a future elevated-CO2 atmosphere.

AB The dominant landscape process on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska is the formation and drainage of thaw lakes. Lakes and drained thaw-lake basins account for approximately 75% of the modem surface expression of the Barrow Peninsula. The thaw-lake cycle usually obliterates lacustrine or peat sediments from previous cycles, which could otherwise be used for paleoecological reconstruction of long-term landscape and vegetation changes. Several possible erosional remnants of a former topographic surface that predates the formation of the thaw lakes have been tentatively identified. These remnants are characterized by a higher elevation, a thick organic layer with very high ground ice content in the upper permafrost and a plant community somewhat atypical of the region. Ten soil cores were collected from one site, and one core was intensively sampled for soil organic carbon content, pollen analysis and C-14 dating. The lowest level of the organic sediments represents the earliest phase of plant growth and dates to ca. 9000 cal BP. Palynological, evidence indicates the presence of mesic shrub tundra (including sedge, birch, willow and heath vegetation), and microfossil indicators point to wetter eutrophic conditions during this period. Carbon accumulation was rapid due to high net primary productivity in a relatively nutrient-rich environment. These results are interpreted as the local response to ameliorating climate during the early Holocene. The middle Holocene portion of the record contains an unconformity, indicating that between 8200 and 4200 cal BP sediments were eroded from the site, presumably in response to wind activity during a drier period centered around 4500 cal BP. The modem vegetation community of the erosional remnant was established after 4200 cal BP and peat growth resumed. During the late Holocene, carbon accumulation rates (CARs) were greatly reduced in response to the combined effects of declining productivity associated with climatic cooling, and increased nutrient stress as paludification and permafrost aggradation sequestered mineral nutrients.

AB Freshwater marshes have been shown to be strong sinks for carbon dioxide (CO2) on an annual basis relative to other wetland types; however it is likely that these ecosystems are also strong emitters of methane (CH4), reducing their carbon (C) sequestration potential. Multiyear C balances in these ecosystems are necessary therefore to determine their contribution to the global C cycle. Despite this, the number of multiyear studies in marshes is few, with, to the best of our knowledge, only one other Northern marsh C balance reported. This study presents five years of eddy covariance flux measurements of CO2, and four years of warm-season chamber measurements of CH4 at a cool-temperate Typha angustifolia marsh. Annual average cumulative net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at the marsh was -224 +/- 54 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SD) over the five-year period, ranging from -126 to -284 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Enhancement of the ecosystem respiration during warmer spring, autumn and winter periods appeared the strongest determinant of annual NEE totals. Warm season fluxes of CH4 from the Typha vegetation (avg. 1.0 +/- 1.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)) were significantly higher than fluxes from the water surface (0.5 +/- 0.4 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and unvegetated mats (0.2 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Air temperature was a primary driver of all CH4 fluxes, while water table was not a significant correlate as water levels were always at or above the vegetative mat surfaces. Weighting by the surface cover proportion of water and vegetation yielded a net ecosystem CH4 emission of 127 +/- 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Combining CO2 and CH4, the annual C sink at the Mer Bleue marsh was reduced to -97 +/- 57 g C m(-2) yr(-1), illustrating the importance of accounting for CH4 when generating marsh C budgets.

AB The Late Permian Moranbah Coal Measures are developed throughout the northern and central Bowen Basin, eastern Australia, and are subject to large-scale opencut coal mining activity. They were deposited in a rapidly subsiding retroarc foreland basin, during frequent base-level changes. Contemporaneous compressive deformation and volcanism facilitated the supply of abundant volcanoclastic sediments, resulting in rapid, but punctuated, basinal aggradation. To the south and east, transgressive-regressive cycles were marked by the inter-digitation of paralic-shallow marine and alluvial strata. Lonestones (dropstones) are common within the marine deposits and are attributed to ice-rafting indicative of a cold-climate depositional regime. Two basin-wide chronostratigraphic units, the P-tuff bed and the Harrow Creek superseam, have been used to evaluate the facies architecture of the stratigraphic interval they enclose. The lithofacies mosaic of the 25-75 m thick sequence has been examined by means of 26 widely distributed coreholes and two detailed district-scale studies based around the Moranbah-Goonyella and German Creek minesites. Eight alluvial-shallow marine facies associations have been recognised. Their architectural and temporal relationships allow the accurate reconstruction of the coal-bearing depositional system. Two dissimilar, stacked, depositional systems tracts, A (organics) and B (clastics) are recognised. The P-tuff bed is enclosed by facies of tract A, forming a thick, low-ash, coal-bearing interval which was emplaced essentially synchronously across the basin. It represents a time of elastic sediment starvation when basin-wide peat mire accumulation prevailed. Four similar extensive coal-bearing intervals within the Moranbah Coal Measures are also considered to represent basin-wide episodes of peat accumulation. This pattern is in strong contrast to traditional views of coal measure development, which argue that coals formed within a contemporary facies fmosaic, in which fluvial channels, levees and crevasse splays were also represented. The second depositional systems tract (B) is characterised by elastic packages, dominated by large-scale (up to 4 km wide and 50 m thick), sandstone bodies deposited by low sinuosity trunk river systems, flanked by substantial crevasse splay deposits (up to 3 km wide and 30 m thick). It represents the product of catastrophic flooding events. The cyclothemic succession of systems tracts A and B is interpreted in terms of eustatic sealevel cycles. The trace A coal-bearing intervals represent relative sealevel lowstands. Systems tract B represents relative sea level highstand with its lower interval at German Creek to the south consisting of paralic and marine facies. The cycles had durations in the order of 400 to 600 ky and are considered to represent 4th order sealevel cycles of the Permian Period. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Marion Island is a Sub-Antarctic island made up of distinct ecological habitats based on soil physiochemical, plant cover and physical characteristics. The microbial diversity and ecological determinants in this harsh Sub-Antarctic environment are largely uncharacterized. Actinobacteria have diverse ecological functions related to soil and plant functioning. This study was aimed at characterizing the diversity and community structures of the dominant actinobacteria in the distinct habitats and to identify their determinant soil and plant characteristics. Using the 16S rRNA gene, the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis patterns and clone library diversity were correlated with the soil and plant characteristics. Multivariate statistical methods were also used to identify determinant soil and plant characteristics. Salinity and pH were the most important soil determinants, and a number of important site-specific plant species may have been important. The Coastal Fellfield Habitat was dominated by sequences of the suborders Micrococcineae (44%) and Propionibacterineae (18%), with salinity identified as the principal determinant. The Cotula Herbfield Habitat was dominated by Frankineae (37%) and Streptosporangineae (38%), which were correlated with organic nutrient concentrations. The Wet Mire Habitat was dominated by Acidimicrobineae (61%), with moisture and organic carbon content as principal components. Culture-dependent studies were complementary to culture-independent studies with the majority of actinobacteria isolated not identified in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. This study demonstrates how the soil physiochemical characteristics and plant species independently determine the community structures of the dominant actinobacteria in distinct ecological habitats. These factors subsequently influence their ecological adaptation, roles and functions.

AB Moorlands perform a wide variety of roles within modern society. A vital component of these landscapes is the patterning of vegetation, and management of this requires a thorough understanding of the drivers of vegetation change. Although there has been a considerable body of research focussed on the processes that are important in patterning contemporary vegetation these typically lack any significant time-depth. Long-term data, using palaeoecological techniques, offer insights into drivers of vegetation change that are otherwise unachievable. This paper presents new palaeoecological data from Dartmoor (UK) to test two hypotheses: (1) that vegetation character of moorland is spatially homogenous through the past 8,000 years; and (2) that burning has a significant role in the development of open, grass-dominated, vegetation. Four peat cores spanning the past 8,000 years were subject to pollen and microcharcoal analysis. Thirty-seven radiocarbon age estimates were obtained to determine age-depth models for the pollen and charcoal stratigraphies. Differences within and between the pollen stratigraphies have been used as an indirect measure of landscape heterogeneity at a coarse scale. The data reveal periods of time during which differences in the vegetation (as sensed by pollen) around each site are small, and periods during which differences between vegetation are large. Periods of time characterised by greater spatial difference, and by inference greater heterogeneity, correlate with periods characterised by greater human exploitation of the landscape as revealed by archaeological evidence. Human activities therefore promote greater spatial patterning in the landscape. Fire alone is not an important control on long-term peatland vegetation development. The results are useful for conservation strategies by demonstrating variability in spatial diversity of vegetation patterns in the past, and pointing towards opportunities to recreate and maintain diverse vegetation mosaics.

AB Finding resilient refractory materials for slagging gasification systems have the potential to reduce costs and improve the overall plant availability by extending the service life. In this study, different refractory materials were evaluated under slagging gasification conditions. Refractory probes were continuously exposed for up to 27 h in an atmospheric, oxygen blown, entrained flow gasifier fired with a mixture of bark and peat powder. Slag infiltration depth and microstructure were studied using SEM EDS. Crystalline phases were identified with powder XRD. Increased levels of Al, originating from refractory materials, were seen in all slags. The fused cast materials were least affected, even though dissolution and slag penetration could still be observed. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were done for mixtures of refractory and slag, from which phase assemblages were predicted and viscosities for the liquid parts were estimated.

   accumulation in a coastal plain environment
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTHERN FLORIDA; PETROGRAPHY; DEPOSITS; SYSTEMS; ORIGIN; USA
AB During Middle Jurassic times peat accumulated in coastal plain environments in an overall transgressive setting in the Sogne Basin, Danish Central Graben, in the North Sea. The coal seams occur in nonmarine to marginal marine deposits. Coal petrographic analyses of the seams in the West Lulu-2 well supplemented with a sequence stratigraphic analysis suggest that peat accumulation was controlled by relative sea-level changes. In West Lulu-2 the coal-bearing upper part of the Middle Jurassic is divided into sequences A and B. The sediments of sequence A are part of a transgressive systems tract, whereas the overlying sequence B contains lowstand and transgressive systems tract deposits. The coals are situated in the transgressive systems tracts. The coal seams formed during a rapid relative sea-level rise are generally characterized by petrographic features related to a permanently high groundwater table. Coals formed during a slow rise typically are 'drier' in their petrographic composition. The highest pyrite contents are observed in the 'wet' coals. The coal seams represent terrestrial equivalents to marine flooding surfaces or to transgressive surfaces if they are situated at the base of a transgressive systems tract. A thick coal seam zone is associated with the stratigraphic level of the maximum flooding surface, which correlates with the time of formation of the highest accommodation space.

AB Seven new species and two varieties of Klebsormidium were described using an integrative approach on the base of 28 strains from the poorly studied phylogenetic superclade G. These strains originated from the unusual and exotic habitats (semi-deserts, semi-arid shrublands, Mediterranean shrub and deciduous vegetation, temperate Araucaria forests, peat bogs, dumps after coal mining, maritime sand dunes etc.) of four continents (Africa, South and North America, and Europe). Molecular phylogenies based on ITS-1,2, rbcL gene and concatenated dataset of ITS-1,2-rbcL, secondary structure of ITS-2, morphology, ecology and biogeography, micrographs and drawings of the investigated strains were assessed. Additionally, phylogeny and morphology of 18 Klebsormidium strains from other lineages isolated from the same localities (different vegetation types of Chile and maritime sand dunes of Germany) were investigated for the comparison with representatives of Glade G. Clade G Klebsormidium is characterized by distant phylogenetic position from the other Klebsormidium lineages and prominent morphology: four-lobed chloroplasts and mostly short swollen cells in young culture, compact small pyrenoids, curved or disintegrated filaments, unusual elongation of cells in old culture, formation of specific cluster- and knot-like colonies on agar surface, especially prominent in strains isolated from desert regions, from which the group probably originated. Comparison of Klebsormidium diversity from different biogeographic regions showed that the representatives of Glade G are common algae in regions of the southern hemisphere (South Africa and Chile) and rare representatives in terrestrial ecosystems of the northern hemisphere. Further investigation of mostly unstudied territories of the southern hemisphere could bring many surprises and discoveries, leading to a change of the present concept that Klebsormidium is cosmopolitan in distribution.

AB The Eocene Kosd Formation forms part of the Hungarian Palaeogene Basin. The coal measure of this formation was investigated using an 18m drill core from borehole W-1. Petrographic and organic geochemical investigations (Rock-Eval pyrolysis, biomarker analysis) were performed in order to characterize the depositional environment, to determine the source of the organic matter within, and to assess the hydrocarbon generative potential.
   The presence of marine fossils, high TOC/S ratios and ash yields show that the deposition of the coal measure occurred in a marine delta with individual coal layers accumulating in low-lying, rheotrophic mires. The distribution of land plant-derived biomarkers demonstrates that the peat-forming vegetation was dominated by angiosperms, but the relative contribution of gymnosperms varied through time. In addition to land plants, algae and aquatic macrophytes contributed to the biomass. This dense vegetation established a CO2-limited environment forcing aquatic plants to utilise HCO3- during photosynthesis. The marine environment, as well as the predominance of carbonate rocks in the hinterland, caused slightly alkaline conditions, which, together with reduced oxygen availability, stimulated sulphate-reducing bacterial activity and the microbial degradation of plant remains. Consequently, Kosd Formation coal is very rich in sulphur (up to 8.8%). Moreover, the coal contains vitrinite with a strong orange-brown fluorescence colour and swells strongly during pyrolysis. These features are typical for coals with marine influences.
   Vitrinite reflectance, Tmax, and biomarker proxies indicate that the organic matter is thermally mature and that the Kosd coal reached the high volatile bituminous rank in the deep borehole (similar to 2.6 km depth). Rock-Eval parameters imply that the coal is gas- and oil-prone and reached the maturity threshold critical for first gas generation and the onset of oil expulsion.

AB Structural aspects of humic substances (HSs) in marine waters of Engao Bay (Atlantic Ocean) and water from the Chubut River (Patagonia, Argentina) were compared. The HSs were isolated, purified, and analyzed using a multiple-method approach for structural characterization: elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C and (1)H NMR), infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible absorption and fluorescence. Similarities between the marine and freshwater components were evaluated on the basis of N and O contents, H/C and C/N atomic ratios, infrared bands from nitrogen-containing and carboxylic groups, percentage of functional groups obtained from NMR spectra, spectral slope coefficient of absorption spectra, absorbance ratios at 250 and 365 nm (E (2)/E (3)), aromaticity, excitation-emission matrices and fluorescence quantum yield. Both the Engao Bay and Chubut River waters have HSs that are mainly composed of fulvic acids (FAs); although they are very similar, they may be distinguished from one another. Similarities include the predominance of aliphatic carbon content (low aromatic content); however, the water bodies differed in their content of proteins and carboxylic acids. The Engao Bay FAs have mainly an aquatic origin; although the Chubut River FAs suggest a similar aquagenic origin, there is also evidence of contributions from pedogenic FAs.

AB Ventifacts, developed on a variety of lithologies and at a range of scales, are reported for the first time from the Falkland Islands, South Atlantic. Detailed observations of ventifact locations and site stratigraphies indicate most examples are associated with a major occasion of wind activity following a period of severely cold climate but before restoration of vegetation cover and peat formation. C-14 dates (c. 13.6-11.0 ka B.P) from basal peats consign ventifact formation to the Late Glacial period. Abundant material susceptible to wind movement was available at that time. The erosion and movement of sand continues at many sites but at none can it be demonstrated that ventifact formation is entirely a recent or contemporary process. The C-14 dates also reveal that climatic amelioration following the last cold episode occurred significantly earlier than previously considered.

TI Assessment of peroxide oxidation for acid sulfate soil analysis. 1.
   Reduced inorganic sulfur

DE pyritic sulfur; peroxide oxidisable sulfur; chromium reducible sulfur;
   jarosite; sulfur budget
AB The reduced inorganic sulfur fraction of 4 acid sulfate soil (ASS) materials was quantified using a variety of peroxide oxidation procedures. The temperature and duration of the peroxide oxidation were found to markedly affect the peroxide oxidisable sulfur determination. For 3 ASS materials with low total carbon content (i.e. <2.5% C), peroxide oxidisable sulfur underestimated the reduced inorganic sulfur fraction, with the peroxide oxidisable sulfur determinations being as low as 42% of those determined using chromium reducible sulfur technique. The precipitation of jarosite during peroxide oxidation was a major factor contributing to the underestimation of reduced inorganic sulfur in these materials. Apparent losses of sulfur of approximately 25% on average occurred during peroxide oxidation budget accounting; this also contributed towards the observed underestimation of reduced inorganic sulfur. It is most likely that these unaccounted losses are due to atmospheric losses of sulfur. In a peat ASS, one of the peroxide oxidation methods overestimated the reduced inorganic sulfur fraction and was attributed to the release of a large reserve of organic sulfur in this material by the peroxide. This study shows the peroxide oxidation methods examined here are subject to substantial interferences. Consequently these peroxide oxidation methods are unable to reliably provide accurate measurements of the reduced inorganic sulfur fraction in ASS materials.

TI Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Northern Ireland

ID GREAT-BRITAIN
AB The amount of carbon stored in vegetation and soils (including peat) in Northern Ireland has been estimated and the distributions mapped on a 1 km x 1 km grid as part of a national inventory. This was funded by Government to help meet some of its commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Knowing the sizes of the carbon stores (reservoirs) and the factors influencing them will help in developing policies to protect and enhance them as a contribution to the amelioration of global warming. To calculate these carbon stores, the area and carbon density of each vegetation and soil type were required. Similar data sources and methods were used to those in complementary inventories in Great Britain, but modifications were required ill Northern Ireland, including the use of CORINE land cover (classification and maps) and the development of a soil carbon database. The total amount of carbon stored is estimated to be 4.4Mt in vegetation (5.1Mt, allowing for forests underestimated by CORINE) and 386Mt in soils. Forests account for 55% of the carbon in vegetation, and peat for 42% of: that in soils-a product of their relatively high carbon densities.

AB Most Precambrian Shield forested catchments have some wetland component. Even small riparian wetlands are important modifiers of stream chemistry. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is one of the most important products exported by wetlands in streams. Stratigraphic control of hydraulic conductivity generally leads to decreasing conductivity with depth. Thus important flowpaths occur in the uppermost organic rich layers and are reflected in chemical profiles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Accumulation of DOC in peat porewaters is the net effect of production, consumption and transport. DOC profiles vary with degree of interaction with the surrounding upland catchment and distance from the edge of the wetland as well as internal processes within the wetland. In wetlands, DOM production is offset by flushing resulting in decreasing DOC concentrations with increasing flows. Despite old carbon (2,000 to 3,000 years) at relatively shallow depths, (14)C activity in DOC exported from wetlands is mostly modem (recent carbon), consistent with shallow flowpaths and export of DOM from shallow organic rich horizons. In contrast, the source area for DOM in upland catchments with developed B horizon soils increases with antecedent soil moisture conditions resulting in increasing DOC concentrations with higher stream flows. Activity of 14C in stream DOC from upland catchments span a range from low activities (older carbon) similar to B horizon soil water during dry moisture conditions to values slightly less than modern (more recent carbon) during high moisture conditions. The more modern carbon activities reflect the increased contribution of the organic rich litter and A horizon soil layers in the area immediately bordering the stream under wet antecedent moisture conditions. Reduced hydrologic export or loss of wetlands under drier climatic conditions may result in in larger fluctuations in stream DOC concentrations and reduced DOM loads to lakes.

AB Oxygen isotope palaeoclimate records, preserved in moss tissue cellulose, are complicated by environmental influences on the relationships between source water inputs and evaporative conditions. We carried out stable isotope analyses of precipitation collected from the maritime Antarctic and cellulose extracted from co-located Chorisodontium aciphyllum dominated moss peat bank deposits accumulated since 1870 A. D. Analyses of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of summer precipitation on Signy Island (60.7 degrees S, 45.6 degrees W) established a local meteoric water line (LMWL) similar to both the global MWL and other LMWLs, and almost identical to the HadAM3 isotope-enabled global circulation model output. The oxygen isotopic composition of cellulose (delta O-18(C)) revealed little temporal variation between four moss peat banks on Signy Island since 1870. However, delta O-18(C) followed two patterns with Sites A and D consistently 3 parts per thousand enriched relative to delta O-18(C) values from Sites B and C. The growing moss surfaces at Sites A and D are likely to have been hydrated by isotopically heavier summer precipitation, whilst at Sites B and C, the moss banks are regularly saturated by the isotopically depleted snow melt streams. Laboratory experiments revealed that evaporative enrichment of C. aciphyllum moss leaf water by 5 parts per thousand occurred rapidly following saturation (ecologically equivalent to post-rainfall or snow melt periods). In addition to the recognized source water-cellulose fractionation extent of 27 +/- 3 parts per thousand, such a shift would account for the 32 parts per thousand difference measured between delta O-18 of Signy Island precipitation and cellulose.

AB Petroleum pollution of the ocean arises from activities undertaken to meet energy requirements such as extraction, transport, and general uses of petroleum products. Marine transport of oil has greatly increased over the past few decades and oil spills affect the living and non-living resources of the surrounding areas. In this study, the effectiveness of pear in the remediation of oil contaminated water was tested and the in-vessel bioremediation of the oil contaminated pear was evaluated.
   The results indicated that kiln dried pear is an excellent absorbent for extracting oil from water It has the ability to remove 99.998% of the oil from contaminated water having an oil slick of 1.3 cm in depth. Mixing the peat with the contaminated water allowed for the coagulation of the pear with oil, and thus increased the oil removal efficiency, but also increased the moisture content of the peat.
   Evidence of three microbial populations (psychrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic) in the bioreactor demonstrated the potential of the in-vessel bioremediation process to achieve a much higher oil degradation efficiency at a lower cost compared to biopiling and lasd farming. The worming of the material in the bioreactor and the increased moisture content were signs of the conversion of complex organic carbon by these microbes into energy, CO2 and H2O. Higher temperatures caused by mesophilic and thermophilic activities resulted in a higher conversion rate. The moisture content, pH and the aeration rare were within the optimum range for the bioremediation process. The poultry manure provided all the required nutrients for microbial growth, bur nitrogen appeared to be the limiting factor: The bioremediation process achieved 56.7% reduction in oil content in about twelve days. Addition of a nitrogen source would have resulted in a much higher reduction percentage. The original humic mixture was reduced to a denser but porous material that looked like a garden soil with a dark brown color and no oil odor.

AB The results of a multi-profile analysis of disturbance phases using Fine Resolution Pollen Analysis (FRPA) are presented. The locale is the North Gill, a peat section 400 m long at an altitude of 370 m, and the time the mid-Holocene in a region known to have been occupied by later Mesolithic and early Neolithic cultures during the time of peat accumulation. Some of the fine detail of the FRPA is given and interpretations advanced which throw more light upon the probable manipulation of vegetation by human groups during the 5th millenium sp. It is concluded that the emphasis on hazel (Corylus avellana) as an object of vegetation management may need to be supplemented by that of the encouragement of a grassy ground flora in what was a mostly wooded environment.

AB Organic carbon mineralization and storage in the inland water bodies is an important component of global carbon cycling. However, the mechanisms influencing carbon cycling in the inland water bodies remain uncertain. In this study, n-alkane data from a sediment core spanning the last glacial-interglacial cycle from Lake Xingkai in northeast China, were analyzed to determine response of regional carbon cycling to climate change. Prior to MIS 1 the sedimentary n-alkanes were mainly derived from terrigenous higher plants and helophytes in the wetland. By contrast, non-photosynthetic bacteria are probable major alternating source of sedimentary n-alkanes during MIS 1. The n-alkanes in the sediments are mainly influenced by the variations of lake level and deposition of mineral dust. The total organic carbon content (TOC) and TOC-normalized middle- and long-chain n-alkane concentrations increased during glacial times and decreased during interglacial periods, reflecting higher rates of organic matter decomposition under warmer climatic conditions. The temperature dependence of lacustrine organic matter mineralization suggests that the carbon burial potential of lakes in northeast China will decrease in the future as global warming intensifies.

AB This study uses life-cycle assessment (LCA) to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from dominant agricultural land uses, and peat and coal electricity generation, with fuel-chains for Miscanthus and short-rotation-coppice willow (SRCW) electricity. A simple scenario was used as an example, where 30% of peat and 10% of coal electricity generation was substituted with co-fired Miscanthus and SRCW, respectively. Miscanthus and SRCW cultivation were assumed to replace sugar-beet, dairy, beef-cattle and sheep systems. GHG emissions of 1938 and 1346 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for Miscanthus and SRCW cultivation compared with between 3494 CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for sugar-beet cultivation and 12,068CO(2)eq.ha(-1)a(-1) for dairy systems. Miscanthus and SRCW fuel chains emitted 0.131 and 0.132 kg CO2 eq. kWh(-1) electricity exported, respectively, compared with 1.150 and 0.990 kg CO2 eq. kWh(-1) electricity exported for peat and coal fuel chains. 1.48 Mt CO2 eq. a(-1) was saved from electricity production, and 0.42 Mt CO2 eq.a(-1) was saved from displaced agriculture and soil C-sequestration. The total reduction of 1-9 Mt CO2 eq.a(-1) represents 2.8% of Ireland's 2004 GHG emissions, but was calculated to require just 1.7% of agricultural land area and displace just 1.2% of the dairy herd (based on conservative Miscanthus and SRCW combustible-yield estimates of 11.7 and 8.81 tha(-1) a(-1) dry matter, respectively). A 50% increase in cultivation emissions would still result in electricity being produced with an emission burden over 80% lower than peat and coal electricity. Lower yield assumptions had little impact on total GHG reductions for the scenario, but required substantially greater areas of land. It was concluded that energy-crop utilisation would be an efficient GHG reduction strategy for Ireland. 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Varve counts with AMS C-14, Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating of sediments (0-900 cm) from Erlongwan Maar Lake, NE China were used to establish a high-resolution chronology series for the late Quaternary. Dry density, total organic carbon (TOC) content, total nitrogen (TN) content, TOC/TN ratios and stable organic carbon isotope (delta C-13(org)) ratios were continuously analyzed on this sediment profile. On the basis of lithological characters, sporo-pollen assemblages and geochemical analyses, we identified 6 climate stages within the last 14 ka BP. The time before the Holocene (14-11.4 ka BP) represents a higher-order oscillation climatic transitional period (I). The entire Holocene climate development (from 11.4 ka BP to present) exhibited an increasing temperature trend, although there were cold and warm alternations (II-VI). The periods included were: II (11.4-9.05 ka BP) warm-wet stage, III (9.05-7.4 ka BP) cold and warm fluctuation stage, IV (7.4-4.2 ka BP) smoothly warming climate stage, V (4.2-1.67 ka BP) climate optimum stage, and VI (from 1.67 ka BP to present) cool and drier stage. Each climate stage began with a warming event and ended with an abrupt cooling event. This climate change cycle had unequal time spaces that were progressively shorter over time. Several abrupt climate shifts occurred at about 9.4-9.05, 8.5-8.2, 7.8-7.4, 4.6-4.2, 3.7-3.25, 2-1.67 and 0.3-0.03 ka BP. Thus, it can be seen that the climate has been warming since 1920 AD, which indicates a new climate stage.

AB Geomorphological changes related to erosion and sedimentation, periglacial processes, and the thermal regime of permafrost can provide important information on the impact of climatic changes on the terrain in arctic regions. In some areas, organic- (peat-) rich stratigraphic sequences can lead to the interpretation of past changes related to the variable intensity of geomorphological processes. In the Arctic, the dual accumulation of peat and sand is closely related to syngenetic aggradation of permafrost and to frost cracking, leading to the formation of tundra polygons. Eolian activity may increase in colder and drier periods. Observations of surface changes (geomorphology and vegetation) in a regional network of sensitive sites, along with climate and permafrost temperature monitoring, constitute a comprehensive method to assess the impact of climatic changes on land systems in the Arctic. One such site, on Bylot Island, provides a good example.

AB The Lopingian coal measures of southwestern China were deposited within a range of facies associations spanning a spectrum of settings from fluvial to marine carbonate platform. The transitional to terrestrial coal measures are dominated by siliciclastics, but they also contain fifteen laterally extensive marine bands (limestone beds and mudstone). These bands act as marker horizons that enable correlation between fully marine and terrestrial fades. Examination of this range of facies and their sedimentology has enabled the development of a high-resolution sequence stratigraphic framework. Set against the established backdrop of second-order Lopingian transgression, sixteen fourth-order sequences and three composite sequences (third-order) are recognized. Results show that, in the composite sequences, peat accumulation in the seaward parts of the study area predominantly correlates with early transgressive sequence sets (TSS), while in more landward areas it correlates with the middle TSS to late highstand sequence sets (HSS). Differences in peat-accumulation regimes within the sequence stratigraphic framework are attributed to variations in subsidence and background siliciclastic input rates in different depositional settings, with these combining to produce differences in the rate of accommodation change. The preservation of coal resources in the middle to late HSS in this area was most likely related to the rise of the regional base level throughout the Lopingian. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB A multi-compartment system, PIGS (Partitioning in Geobiochemical Systems), with five compartments was constructed to study metal distribution between soil constituents. Soil microorganisms (Pseudomonas putida, Trichoderma harzianum) were compared with common soil minerals (kaolin and aluminium oxide) and solid organic matter (peat) with respect to their ability to accumulate Zn, Cd and Hg. Experiments were conducted under conditions that are representative of natural soils concerning pH, metal concentration, ionic strength and microbial activity. Different relative amounts of the solid phases were used to approach natural conditions. Results from the PIGS indicated considerable differences in metal distribution between the various solids, and also indicated that for the different solid phases metal distribution was related to variations in pH and ionic strength of the solutions in different ways. The presence of fulvic acid generally decreased metal accumulation by peat and microorganisms around neutral pH. Accumulation by organic compounds (peat), as well as by microorganisms, was substantial under experimental conditions used, i.e. up to more than 40 and 20% of the added metals was accumulated by these components, respectively. In some cases the considerable accumulation of trace metals by the fungus and the bacterium under acidic conditions is of particular interest, since this process may counteract the metal-mobilizing effects of soil acidification. It is evident from our study that microorganisms should not be overlooked when studying metal interactions with soil constituents. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB The effect of heavy metals on microbial respiration in organic materials used as soil amendments was evaluated to assess the stability of the materials. Solutions of Pb (II), Cu (II) and Zn (II) at rates of 5, 10 and 50 mg metal g(-1) were added to green waste compost, peat, coir and wood bark. Metal toxicity led to a significant decrease in carbon dioxide evolved by the contaminated materials, up to 80% less at the highest rate of addition compared to the untreated material. There was a significant negative correlation between the organic carbon content of an amendment and the inhibition of CO2 evolution by all three heavy metals. There was also a significant negative correlation between an amendment's cation exchange capacity and the inhibition of CO2 evolution caused by Cu and Zn. The ability of the organic materials to enhance respiration in a soil from the vicinity of a Pb/Zn mine was also evaluated, by applying them to the soil at rates of 1, 10 and 20%. CO2 evolution from the contaminated soil was enhanced significantly by the addition of all of the amendments, with coir causing up to 90% enhancement at high levels of addition.

AB Enzyme catalyzed reactions are generally considered the rate-limiting step in organic matter degradation and may be significantly influenced by the structure and composition of plant communities. Changes in these rates have the potential to effect long-term peat accumulation and influence the topography of a wetland ecosystem. To determine habitat influences on enzyme activities, we examined slough and sawgrass plots within enriched and reference phosphorus (P) sites in the Everglades. Assays were performed for the enzymes involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and P cycling and lignin depolymerization. Enzyme activities were normalized and analyzed in terms of a resource allocation strategy. Plant composition was found to significantly alter the allocation of enzymatic resources due to varying substrate complexities. Potential decomposition in the slough was less influenced by lignin than in the sawgrass habitats. Additionally, an index relating hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes was significantly greater in the slough habitats, whereas ON ratios were significantly lower. These indices suggest more favorable decomposition conditions and thus slower peat accretion within the slough communities, which may contribute to the development of elevation differences within the sawgrass ridge and slough topography of the Everglades.

AB New palynological and sedimentological data from St. Lawrence Island present a rare view into late-glacial and Holocene environments of the central Bering Land Bridge. The late glaciation was a time of dynamic landscape changes in south-central Beringia, with active thermokarst processes, including the formation and drainage of thaw lakes. The presence of such a wet, unstable substrate, if widespread, probably would have had an adverse impact on food sources and mobility for many of the large mammal populations. The establishment of Betula shrub tundra on the island suggests late-glacial summers that were warmer than present, consistent with regional paleoclimatic interpretations. However, the increasing proximity to the Bering Sea, as postglacial sea levels rose, modified the intensity of warming and prevented the establishment of deciduous forest as found in other areas of Beringia at this time. The mid- to late Holocene is marked by more stable land surfaces and development of Sphagnum and Cyperaceae peat deposits. The accumulation of organic deposits, decline of shrub Betula, and decrease in thermokarst disturbance suggest that conditions were cooler than the previous. A recent decline in peat accumulation at the study sites may relate to local geomorphology, but similar decreases have been noted for other arctic regions. (C) 2011 University of Washington.

AB Human activities have enhanced the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from organic soils. Drained peat soils may turn into a source of CO2 and N2O, whereas CH4 emission may generally decrease after drainage. Agricultural use, including ploughing, fertilization and irrigation, further enhances the decomposition of peat, and CO2 and N2O emissions. Cultivated organic soils are therefore significant sources of CO2 and N2O. In this paper we report greenhouse gas emissions from cultivated organic soils, and from abandoned organic agricultural soils, i.e. from organic soils where cultivation practices have ceased. We found that CO2 and N2O emissions from abandoned organic cropland soils do not generally decrease with time after agricultural practices have ceased, whereas CH4 fluxes from the atmosphere into the soil may gradually increase after leaving cultivation.

AB Climate warming and organic matter decomposition are connected in a recursive manner; this recursion can be described by temperature sensitivity. We conducted a multifactorial laboratory experiment to quantify the temperature sensitivity of organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) decomposition processes of common boreal organic soils. We incubated 36 mor and 36 slightly decomposed Carex-Sphagnum peat samples in a constant moisture and ambient temperature for 6 months. The experiment included three temperature and two moisture levels and two food web manipulations (samples with and without fungivore enchytraeid worms). We determined the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seven molecular size classes together with ammonium N and dissolved organic N in low molecular weight and high molecular weight fractions. The temperature sensitivity function Q(10) was fit to the data. The C and N release rate was almost an order of magnitude higher in mor than in peat. Soil fauna increased the temperature sensitivity of C release. Soil fauna played a key role in N release; when fauna was absent in peat, the N release was ceased. The wide range of the studied C and N compounds and treatments (68 Q(10) datasets) allowed us to recognize five different temperature sensitivity patterns. The most common pattern (37 out of 68) was a positive upwards temperature response, which was observed for CO2 and DOC release. A negative downward pattern was observed for extractable organic nitrogen and microbial C. Sixteen temperature sensitivity patterns represented a mixed type, where the Q(10) function was not applicable, as this does not allow changing the sign storage change rate with increasing or decreasing temperature. The mixed pattern was typically connected to intermediate decomposition products, where input and output fluxes with different temperature sensitivities may simultaneously change the storage. Mixed type was typical for N processes. Our results provide useful parameterization for ecosystem models that describe the feedback loop between climate warming, organic matter decomposition, and productivity of N-limited vegetation.

AB The Dursunbey coalfield, a typical example of coalfields in the western Anatolia, hosts a mineable coal seam (about 9.0-m coal thickness) with altered tuff layers within early Miocene fluvio-lacustrine sequences. The aim of this study is to identify peat-accumulation conditions and factors controlling the mineralogy and geochemistry of this seam. The standard coal features and petrographical, mineralogical, and elemental compositions display changes throughout the seam. Ash yields display decreasing trends towards to the upper parts of seam, while total C contents and gross calorific values are increasing. Furthermore, the coal-facies patterns evidence changes of depositional conditions and vegetation in the palaeomires. During initial stages of peat accumulation, the contribution of herbaceous peat-forming plants were more common and palaeomires were open to detrital inputs, whereas woody peat-forming were becoming predominant, and the water table was stable and high, which caused development of anoxic conditions, during late stages. Therefore, the content of detrital minerals, such as quartz and clay minerals (illite, smectite, and chlorite) increases in the lower parts of seam, while that of pyrite increases in the upper parts. In addition, the SEM-EDX data show that matrices of clay mineral aggregates are illitic in composition in the lower parts of seam, while those of smectite prevalence are more common below and above altered tuff layers. Interestingly, authigenic rhomboid K-feldspar grains are observed within smectite clay aggregates in the samples from the upper parts of seam. Framboidal pyrite grains and clusters were also commonly identified from these samples as well. This data shows that synchronous volcanic inputs were altered within a hydrologically closed system under slight acidic to neutral conditions during late syngenetic stages.
   The enriched elements, such as Cr, Ni, Cs, and V, display moderate to strong positive correlations with ash yields while Al2O3, and K2O indicate an aluminosilicate affinity (clay mineral and feldspar). Considering the presence of metamorphic and ophiolitic rocks in the basement and the adjacent areas, clastic inputs into the palaeomire seems to be controlling aluminosilicate-affiliated elements. Additionally, the SEM-EDX analyses denoted that Ni and As are associated with pyrite. The Ni and As-bearing epigenetic pyrite infillings are mostly identified in coal samples below altered tuff layers; hence, As and Ni enrichments are controlled by precipitation of leached pore waters from altered tuff layers. Nevertheless, As-and Ni-bearing syngenetic pyrite grains and clusters are related with the development of anoxic conditions within palaeomires. This could also favour a Mo and U enrichment, which is another testimony for synchronous volcanic inputs altered under anoxic conditions. Overall, high detrital-input ratios from adjacent areas during initial stages of peat-accumulation in the study area controlled by enrichments of aluminosilicate affiliated elements, whereas during late stages of peat -accumulation, the development of a hydrologically closed system and redox conditions within the palaeomire caused As, Ni, Mo, and U enrichments and the formation of smectite and authigenic K-feldspars.

AB The Amur Basin, on the border of Russia and China, has accumulated substantial quantities of peat that have allowed the reconstruction of past vegetation and environments, especially during the Holocene. In this paper, a detailed pollen record from the Basin has been constructed for the last 3800 years and interpreted with the assistance of 40 surface pollen samples taken from vegetation types representative of a broader region. In addition, fossil microcharcoal counts were undertaken to explore variation in fire frequency and the role of fire in peat development and landscape disturbance. The record can be divided into four periods. (1) A period of deciduous broadleaved forest dominated by Betula and Quercus accompanied by thriving sedge-dominated wetlands indicating relatively warm and wet conditions between about 3800 and 2000 cal BP. (2) Coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest domination between about 2000 and 680 cal BP indicating a shift to a cooler climate. (3) Betula-dominant deciduous forest, reduced sedge-dominated wetlands and increased burning between about 680 and 250 cal BP indicating further drying and cooling during the Little Ice Age. (4) Secondary pine forest combined with a large increase in fire activity as well as a further reduction in the swamp environment signaling substantial human impact in the last 250 years.

AB Over the last decades, commercial humic products (HPs) from various resources found multiple applications in agriculture and environmental technologies. The key factor defining chemical properties and biological activity of HPs is their organic matter origin. Thus, there is a need to find diagnostic criteria for differentiating organic sources of HPs. The objective was to determine indicators using absorption and fluorescence spectra in combination with derivative spectroscopy that might serve as tools to compare HPs from various environments, both as bulk materials and their humic acid (HA) fractions.
   HA-like fractions were isolated from commercially available humates, industrially manufactured from a number of raw source materials, such as: fossils (brown coal and leonardite), peat, lake-bottom sediment, and organic waste material (lignosulphonate). They were analyzed using chemical, fluorescence, and UV-Vis measurements. Elemental composition and ash content were determined. The "blue shift" of fluorescence band was defined with excitations at 310 and 270 nm or 355 and 310 nm. The following indices have been calculated from absorption spectra: specific absorbances normalized by the HA content, absorbance ratios E (2):E (3), E (4):E (6), E (270/400) E (280/472), E (280/664), Delta log K, and the spectral slope ratio Sr. In addition, we implement new indices: the ratio of amplitudes in the first-order (FDR280/240) and in the second-order derivative spectra (SDR267/280).
   Absorption spectra of HA-like fractions isolated from HPs varying in organic matter origin demonstrated similar wavelength-dependent character. However, some HA-like fractions demonstrate weak maxima in the derivative spectra with enhanced spectral resolution at 230 and 280 nm. This effect is most probably due to the presence of low molecular weight phenolic compounds, products of lignin decomposition. HA-like fractions isolated from peat- and lignosulphonate-derived HPs show fluorescence maximum at shorter wavelengths than HA-like fractions from coal- and sapropel-derived HPs. Under excitation at 310 nm, certain peat- and lignosulphonate- originated samples manifest significant "blue shift" of emission band. In contrast, HA-like fractions from coal- and sapropel-derived HPs exhibit excitation-independent fluorescence band position or its small shift to longer wavelengths.
   Information extracted from absorption and fluorescence spectra can be useful to discriminate organic matter source for HPs from coalified materials (fossils), peat, and lignosulphobate. Indices with the highest descriptive ability, showing strong loadings in principal component analysis, are as follows: specific absorbance SUVA(254), absorbance ratios E (270/400), E (280/472,) derivative indices FDR280/240 and SDR267/280, wavelength of fluorescence maximum, and the presence of "blue shift".

AB Organic matter steadily accumulates in eutrophic lakes as a result of deposition of detrital tissue from algae and aquatic macrophytes and the slow rate of anaerobic decomposition. The rate of organic matter decomposition is affected by the nature of the sediment C (electron donor) and supply of electron acceptors. Batch incubation experiments were conducted to determine the rate and extent of organic matter decomposition in bottom sediments under anoxic conditions. Sediment samples from three distinct horizons were collected from a hypereutrophic lake (Lake Apopka, located in central Florida), which included the surface unconsolidated flocculent material (UCF), an underlying consolidated flocculent material (CF) and a native peat sediment. Sediment samples were incubated in serum bottles at 15, 25, and 35-degrees-C in the dark for 534 d. Periodically, the serum bottle head space was analyzed for CO2 and CH4 produced during decomposition. At selected time intervals, the sediments were analyzed for water soluble organic C, pH, exchangeable NH4-N, and soluble reactive P. First-order rate constants for C mineralization (defined as the sum of gaseous C evolved and soluble C species produced) ranged from 6.7 x 10(-4) d-1 for the UCF sediment incubated at 35-degrees-C to 8.2 x 10(-6) d-1 for the peat sediments incubated at 15-degrees-C. Two phases of organic C decomposition were observed in the UCF and CF sediments while, decomposition in the peat sediments was characterized by only one phase. The UCF sediment, composed of recently deposited detrital organic matter, was found to be the most labile. However, under current experimental conditions, only 8.6% of the UCF sediment organic C was mineralized to CO2 and CH4. The biodegradability of sediment organic C ranked in the order UCF > CF > peat. Net mineralization of N and P was observed in all of the sediment samples (with the exception of the CF samples incubated at 15-degrees-C). The N and P mineralized during the decomposition of UCF organic matter may contribute to the nutrient load of the overlying water column.

AB Diatom, pollen, foraminifera and thecamoebian assemblages from an outcrop of peat and silt at Girdwood Flats, in the upper Turnagain Arm of the Cook Inlet, Alaska, record four phases of relative land and sea-level changes. The first phase is the development of freshwater swamp above high marsh sediments during relative land uplift, caused by strain accumulation along the locked portion of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone. In second phase, the top 2 cm of the peat, all microfossil groups record pre-seismic relative sea-level rise (relative land subsidence). The third phase is rapid land subsidence, 1.7 m, during the earthquake of March 1964 that initiated intertidal silt accumulation above the peat. The final phase is the colonisation of mudflat by salt marsh communities during post-seismic land uplift. The microfossil data compare favourably with sequences from Washington, Oregon and British Columbia that record late Holocene submergence events caused by earthquakes. The comparable changes in microfossil assemblages record the different phases of relative land and sea-level changes and the magnitude of land subsidence caused by each earthquake (expressed relative to the tidal range at the site). These results raise the question whether preseismic sea-level rise represents any kind of warning of large earthquakes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the present paper is to analyse factors controlling total concentration and aqueous speciation of aluminium in the Grosse One River, using a thermodynamic equilibrium model and a mixing approach. A model compound for humic substances is derived on the basis of the relation between anion deficit and the organic carbon content in the river as well as literature data. An equilibrium speciation model for aluminium is set up, considering this model compound and relevant inorganic solutes. Although the model cannot be verified directly, its results may be viewed as qualitatively correct, Applying the model to measured stream water samples highlights that aqueous speciation of aluminium is mainly controlled by the pH value and discharge and that free aluminium concentrations reach clearly toxic levels during acidic episodes. Comparing measured concentrations of sulfate and H+ and calculated concentrations of Al3+ with solubility curves of gibbsite like minerals and jurbanite clearly shows that total aluminium concentrations are not controlled by equilibria with these mineral phases alone. The observed relationship can be better explained from a mixture of two distinct waters, representing lowflow and highflow chemistry, and the resulting equilibrium concentrations. This indicates that total aluminium concentration, in particular during high discharge events, is mainly controlled by the mixture of waters with differing chemistry and flowpaths.

AB Minerals in coal provide useful information for not only paleo-environments of peat accumulation, but also for geological evolution during later diagenesis and/or epigenesis. This paper reports new data on coal quality and the mineralogical and geochemical compositions of 17 unaltered (by intrusion) coal samples collected from the Huainan coalfield, providing new insight into the origins and modes of occurrence of the minerals in coal and their geological evolution. The results showed that the studied coal samples were low rank bituminous coal, with low ash yield (11.92-38.31%, average 24.80%) and high volatile content (25.13-43.43%, average 37.29%). Minerals in the coal mainly included kaolinite and quartz; varying proportions of calcite, siderite, ankerite, and pyrite; and traces of chlorite, zircon, strontianite, apatite, and gorceixite. Typical modes of mineral occurrence could be used to determine the formation stage of minerals. The detrital mineral, occurring as sub-angular to rounded discrete fragments or thin layers intimately admixed with organic matter at particular horizons, was of terrigenous origin, deposited during peat accumulation. Cell infillings, as well as nodule siderites and polycrystalline aggregates of pyrite, precipitated during the syngenetic to early diagenetic stages. Cleat infillings, compressed cell infillings, and fracture infillings precipitated in the epigenetic stage. However, the stage of mineral formation of the pore infilling was difficult to determine. Combined with coal quality, mineralogy, and geochemical analysis, the sedimentary environment of Shanxi Formation was affected by seawater, and Fe-rich hydrothermal fluids filled into the No. 3 coal seam in the epigenetic stage. The sedimentary environment of the No. 8 coal seam had widespread reduction and acid conditions due to basin subsidence, and sulfate-rich hydrothermal fluids may have been formed during the peat deposition stage. In contrast, the peat accumulation environment of the Upper Shihezi Formation was oxidized with a low pH condition. Alkaline fluid then flowed into the No. 13-1 coal seam in the epigenetic stage.

AB High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with size exclusion (SEC) separation function was used to isolate and examine the molecular mass (MM) distributions and polydispersity of humic substances (HSs) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from mineral soils and peats. The aim was to improve their detailed characterisation and to inform of their soil carbon (C) sequestration and environmental quality. This is the first study conducted in Lithuania in which HSs and DOM, separated from two soil types, have been used to characterise soil at the molecular level. The HPLC-SEC, as a separation method, was coupled with diode-array detection (DAD), thus enabling the separation of molecular fractions. Results showed that HPLC-SEC can be used to determine the MM of HSs in soil, provided that the relation between retention time and MM is known and a suitable method for fitting the HS peak is available. The UV-spectra analysis showed that DOM has a larger MM (M-w=2439-3436Da), which contains more aliphatic C. The HS fraction has a smaller MM (M-w=2776Da), with aromatic structures that reflect a higher aromaticity. Separated fractions had characteristic MMs of humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) and DOM. The HSs separated from peat samples were characterised by higher aromaticity, humification and stability. The HSs extracted from mineral soil samples showed a higher degradability level. The results also show the MM distribution and polydispersity of HS and DOM fractions (M-w/M-n=1.009-1.252) are relatively homogenous in both soil types. Findings confirm that chromatographic and spectrometric parameters can be used for characterisation of both HSs and DOM, and for detecting changes in organic matter quality. Moreover, they can also be used for a further understanding the C-cycle and could be applied for enhancing soil C-sequestration and informing environmental quality management.

AB Wetlands are an important part of the global soil organic carbon pool and microorganisms play a pivotal role in carbon exchange between soils and atmosphere. Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Development of maize (Zea mays L.) types that produce leaf area quickly and mature rapidly may increase maize yields in mid- to short-season areas. The leafy (Lfy1) and reduced-stature (rd1) traits each contribute to this objective; however, these two traits have not previously been combined. Our objective was to determine the effect of these traits, alone or in combination, on morphology, reproductive development, and yield of maize hybrids. A field experiment including 14 hybrids [two non-leafy reduced-stature (NLRS), four leafy reduced-stature (LRS), eight leafy normal stature (LNS)], and three commercial hybrid checks [non-leafy normal-stature (NLNS)] was conducted in 1992 and 1993. The following variables were recorded for each hybrid: plant height, internode length, ear height, above-ear leaf number, above-ear leaf area, corn heat units from planting to tasseling, corn heat units from planting to silking, days from tasseling to silking, grain yield (Mg ha(-1)), grain moisture content, husk dry weight, husk moisture content, cob dry weight, cob moisture content, kernel number per row, maximum ear circumference, and ear length. The normal stature hybrids were the tallest plants, with higher ear placement than reduced stature hybrids. The leafy trait was associated with shorter internodes, increased leaf number, and greater above ear led area. The reduced stature hybrids required fen er corn heat units to reach anthesis than the normal stature hybrids. The reduced stature hybrids had the lowest grain moisture (210-270 g kg(-1)), husk moisture, and cob moisture contents at the time of harvesting. The LNS hybrids matured late and had grain moisture contents of 350 to 400 g kg(-1) at harvest. In general grain yield, husk dry weight, cob dry weight, kernel number per row, ear length, and maximum ear circumference were higher for the normal stature hybrids than for the reduced stature hybrids. The earlier anthesis and lon er grain, husk, and cob moisture contents indicated potential for successful grain production and harvest of leafy reduced stature hybrids in shorter growing season areas.

AB The European conquest of the New World produced major socio-environmental reorganization in the Americas, but for many specific regions and ecosystems, we still do not understand how these changes occurred within a broader temporal framework. In this paper, we reconstruct the long-term environmental and vegetation changes experienced by high-altitude wetlands of the southcentral Andes over the last two millennia. Pollen and charcoal analyses of a 5.5-m-long core recovered from the semi-arid puna of northern Chile indicate that while climatic drivers influenced vegetation turnaround, human land use and management strategies significantly affected long-term changes. Our results indicate that the puna vegetation mostly dominated by grasslands and some peatland taxa stabilized during the late Holocene, xerophytic shrubs expanded during extremely dry events, and peatland vegetation persisted in relation to landscape-scale management strategies by Andean pastoralist societies. Environmental changes produced during the post-conquest period included the introduction of exotic taxa, such as clovers, associated with the translocation of exotic herding animals (sheep, cattle, and donkeys) and a deterioration in the management of highland wetlands.

AB Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from plants have substantial effects on atmospheric chemistry/physics and feedbacks on ecosystem function. The on-going climate change and anthropogenic disturbance have been confirmed to cause the evident degradation of grassland with shift of plant community, and hence BVOCs emissions were suspected to be altered due to the different BOVCs emission potentials of different species. In this study, we investigated BVOCs concentration above ground surface during growing season in a degraded semi-arid grassland (41 degrees 2'N-45 degrees 6'N, 113 degrees 5'-117 degrees 8') in Inner Mongolia. The observed monoterpenes' concentrations varied from 0.10 to 215.78 mu gm(-3) (34.88 +/- 9.73 mu gm(-3) in average) across 41 sites. Compared to non-degraded grassland, concentrations of monoterpenes were about 180 times higher at the sites dominated by subshrub - Artemisia frigida, a preponderant species under drought stress and over-grazing. The biomass of A. frigida explained 51.39% of the variation of monoterpenes' concentrations. a-pinene, beta-pinene and gamma-terpinene dominated in the 10 determined monoterpenes, accounting for 37.72 +/- 2.98%, 14.65 +/- 2.55% and 10.50 +/- 2.37% of the total monoterpenes concentration, respectively. Low isoprene concentrations (<= 3.25 mu g m(-3)) were found and sedge biomass contributed about 51.76% to their spatial variation. alpha-pinene and isoprene emissions at noon were as high as 515.53 +/- 88.34 mu g m(-2) h(-1) and 7606.19 +/- 1073.94 mu g m(-2)h(-1) in A. frigida- and sedge-dominated areas where their biomass were 236.90 g m(-2) and 72.37 g m(-2), respectively. Our results suggested that the expansion of A. frigida and sedge caused by over-grazing and climatic stresses may increase local ambient BVOCs concentration in grassland. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB PALADYN is presented; it is a new comprehensive and computationally efficient land surface-vegetation-carbon cycle model designed to be used in Earth system models of intermediate complexity for long-term simulations and paleoclimate studies.
   The model treats in a consistent manner the interaction between atmosphere, terrestrial vegetation and soil through the fluxes of energy, water and carbon. Energy, water and carbon are conserved. PALADYN explicitly treats permafrost, both in physical processes and as an important carbon pool. It distinguishes nine surface types: five different vegetation types, bare soil, land ice, lake and ocean shelf. Including the ocean shelf allows the treatment of continuous changes in sea level and shelf area associated with glacial cycles. Over each surface type, the model solves the surface energy balance and computes the fluxes of sensible, latent and ground heat and upward shortwave and longwave radiation. The model includes a single snow layer.
   Vegetation and bare soil share a single soil column. The soil is vertically discretized into five layers where prognostic equations for temperature, water and carbon are consistently solved. Phase changes of water in the soil are explicitly considered. A surface hydrology module computes precipitation interception by vegetation, surface runoff and soil infiltration. The soil water equation is based on Darcy's law. Given soil water content, the wetland fraction is computed based on a topographic index. The temperature profile is also computed in the upper part of ice sheets and in the ocean shelf soil.
   Photosynthesis is computed using a light use efficiency model. Carbon assimilation by vegetation is coupled to the transpiration of water through stomatal conductance. PALADYN includes a dynamic vegetation module with five plant functional types competing for the grid cell share with their respective net primary productivity.
   PALADYN distinguishes between mineral soil carbon, peat carbon, buried carbon and shelf carbon. Each soil carbon type has its own soil carbon pools generally represented by a litter, a fast and a slow carbon pool in each soil layer. Carbon can be redistributed between the layers by vertical diffusion and advection. For the vegetated macro surface type, decomposition is a function of soil temperature and soil moisture. Carbon in permanently frozen layers is assigned a long turnover time which effectively locks carbon in permafrost. Carbon buried below ice sheets and on flooded ocean shelves is treated differently. The model also includes a dynamic peat module.
   PALADYN includes carbon isotopes C-13 and C-14, which are tracked through all carbon pools. Isotopic discrimination is modelled only during photosynthesis.
   A simple methane module is implemented to represent methane emissions from anaerobic carbon decomposition in wetlands (including peatlands) and flooded ocean shelf.
   The model description is accompanied by a thorough model evaluation in offline mode for the present day and the historical period.

AB An improvement in our process-based understanding of carbon (C) exchange in the Arctic and its climate sensitivity is critically needed for understanding the response of tundra ecosystems to a changing climate. In this context, we analysed the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in West Greenland tundra (64 degrees N) across eight snow-free periods in 8 consecutive years, and characterized the key processes of net ecosystem exchange and its two main modulating components: gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco). Overall, the ecosystem acted as a consistent sink of CO2, accumulating 30 gCm(-2) on average (range of -17 to -41 gCm(-2)) during the years 2008-2015, except 2011 (source of 41 gCm(-2)), which was associated with a major pest outbreak. The results do not reveal a marked meteorological effect on the net CO2 uptake despite the high interannual variability in the timing of snowmelt and the start and duration of the growing season. The ranges in annual GPP (182 to 316 gCm(-2)) and R-eco (144 to 279 gCm(-2)) were > 5 fold larger than the range in NEE. Gross fluxes were also more variable (coefficients of variation are 3.6 and 4.1% respectively) than for NEE (0.7 %). GPP and R-eco were sensitive to insolation and temperature, and there was a tendency towards larger GPP and R-eco during warmer and wetter years. The relative lack of sensitivity of NEE to meteorology was a result of the correlated response of GPP and R-eco. During the snow-free season of the anomalous year of 2011, a biological disturbance related to a larvae outbreak reduced GPP more strongly than R-eco. With continued warming temperatures and longer growing seasons, tundra systems will increase rates of C cycling. However, shifts in sink strength will likely be triggered by factors such as biological disturbances, events that will challenge our forecasting of C states.

AB The boreal forest, one of the world's larger biomes, is distinct from other biomes because it experiences a short growing season and extremely cold winter temperatures. Despite its size and impact on the earth's climate system, measurements of mass and energy exchange have been rare until the past five years. This paper overviews results of recent and comprehensive field studies conducted in Canada, Siberia and Scandinavia on energy exchanges between boreal forests and the atmosphere.
   How the boreal biosphere and atmosphere interact to affect the interception of solar energy and how solar energy is used to evaporate water and heat the air and soil is examined in detail. Specifically, we analyse the magnitudes, temporal and spatial patterns and controls of solar energy, moisture and sensible heat fluxes across the land-atmosphere interface. We interpret and synthesize field data with the aid of a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model, which considers the coupling of the energy and carbon fluxes and nutrient status.
   Low precipitation and low temperatures limit growth of many boreal forests. These factors restrict photosynthetic capacity and lower root hydraulic conductivity and stomatal conductance of the inhabitant forests. In such circumstances, these factors interact to form a canopy that has a low leaf area index and exerts a significant resistance to evaporation. Conifer forests, growing on upland soils, for example, evaporate at rates between 25 and 75% of equilibrium evaporation and lose less than 2.5 mm day(-1) of water. The open nature of many boreal conifer forest stands causes a disproportionate amount of energy exchange to occur at the soil surface. The climatic and physiological factors that yield relatively low rates of evaporation over conifer stands also cause high rates of sensible heat exchange and the diurnal development of deep planetary boundary layers. In contrast, evaporation from broad-leaved aspen stands and fen/wetlands approach equilibrium evaporation rates and lose up to 6 mm day(-1).

AB The Xihu Sag in the East China Sea Shelf Basin is a focus for hydrocarbon exploration and development. Hydrocarbons in the Xihu Sag are believed to have mainly originated from coals in the Paleogene Pinghu Formation (shortened as Pinghu coal). In this study, the hydrocarbon generation potential, origin of organic matter, and depositional setting of the Pinghu coal were analyzed by means of optical microscopic analysis, bulk organic geochemistry, and molecular geochemistry analysis. The results reveal that the maceral compositions of the Pinghu coal are characterized by a predominance of vitrinite (73.91-96.13%) with relatively high contents of liptinite (1.47-23.02%) and only minor amounts of inertinite (0-5.18%). Type II-III kerogen and high values of TOC (total organic carbon) (8.24-56.77%), EOM (extractable organic matter) (14 601-112 259 ppm), and HI (hydrogen index) (178.76-291.18 mg-FIC/g-TOC) indicate that the Pinghu coal is both gas- and oil-prone and could not only generate but also expel hydrocarbons. The results of vitrinite reflectance (0.54-0.90%), Tmax (421-453 degrees C), and biomarker-related parameters, including CPI (carbon preference index) (1.10-1.61), OEP (odd-to-even predominance) (1.09-1.49), 22S/(22S + 22R) for C-3(1) homohopane (0.59-0.62), and 22S/(22S + 22R) for C-32 homohopane (0.57-0.60), suggest that these coaly source rocks have entered the hydrocarbon generation threshold, most of which have entered the expulsion threshold. Biomarker-related parameters of Sigma n-C21-/Sigma n-C-22(+) (0.38-3.62), Pr/Ph (3.33-9.23), Pr/n-C17 (1.91-14.88), Ph/n-C18 (0.35-1.83), 22S/(22S+22R) of C-31 homohopane (0.59-0.62), 22S/(22S + 22R) of C-32 homohopane (0.57-0.60), 1,2,7-TMN/1,3,7-TMN (0.74-14.39), and 1,2,5-TMN/1,3,6-TMN (2.22-21.07) suggest that organic matter in the Pinghu coal was deposited under relatively oxic peatland conditions characterized by a predominance of terrestrial higher plant input, especially the resin-rich Pinaceae and Taxodiaceae. The absence of combustion-derived PAHs indicates that neither vegetation fire nor peat fire occurred very frequently during the formation of peat. Areas in the Xihu sag with considerable thicknesses of coal should be paid particular attention for future hydrocarbon exploration. From a global perspective, Cenozoic coaly source rocks, which are characterized by a relatively high content of aliphatic components, should be paid special attention for their oil-prone properties related to the advent of conifer plants.

AB Petrographic analyses of 25 coal balls from well-studied paleobotanical profiles in the Middle Pennsylvanian Herrin Coal (Westphalian D, Illinois Basin) and five select coal balls from university collections, indicate that Herrin Coal-ball peats were permineralized by fibrous and non-fibrous carbonates. Fibrous carbonates occur in fan-like to spherulitic arrays in many intracellular (within tissue) pores, and are best developed in relatively open extracellular (between plant) pore spaces. Acid etched fibrous carbonates appear white under reflected light and possess a microaystalline texture attributable to abundant microdolomite. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electron microprobe analysis demonstrate that individual fibers have a distinct trigonal prism morphology and are notable for their magnesium content (approximate to 9-15 mol%MgCO3). Non-fibrous carbonates fill intercrystalline spaces among fibers and pores within the peat as primary precipitates and neomorphic replacements. In the immediate vicinity of plant cell walls, non-fibrous carbonates cut across fibrous carbonates as a secondary, neomorphic phase attributed to coalification of plant cell walls. Dolomite occurs as diagenetic microdolomite associated with the fibrous carbonate phase, as sparite replacements, and as void-filling cement. Maximum dolomite (50-59 wt.%) is in the top-of-seam coal-ball zone at the Sahara Mine, which is overlain by the marine Anna Shale.
   Coal-ball formation in the Herrin Coal began with the precipitation of fibrous high magnesium calcite. The trigonal prism morphology of the carbonate fibers suggests rapid precipitation from super-saturated, meteoric pore waters. Carbonate precipitation from marine waters is discounted on the basis of stratigraphic, paleobotanical, and stable isotopic evidence. Most non-fibrous carbonate is attributable to later diagenetic events, including void-fill replacements, recrystallization, and post-depositional fracture fills. Evidence suggests that CO2 degassing was important in coal-ball formation in the Herrin Coal, which mainly occurred sequentially upward with peat accumulation in the sites studied.

AB The biomass within two Early Pennsylvanian (Langsettian [Westphalian A] equivalent) penecontemporaneous swamp communities was sampled quantitatively to obtain an estimate of the taxonomic contribution to each assemblage. Blocks of organic-rich shale were removed from a elastic parting within the Black Creek Coat, and similar to 0.5-m(2) siltstone quadrats were chain-sawed from a elastic swamp community directly above the Bear Creek Coal. Bedding planes were exposed, and the surface areas for each taxon per bedding surface were measured and used as proxies for biomass contribution in each locality. Biomass over a combined area of 5.47 m(2) was assessed for the Black. Creek Coal parting; biomass covering an area of 9.70 m(2) was evaluated for the assemblage preserved above the Bear Creek coal. In addition to calculating standard diversity indices, this data set was analyzed using cluster analyses and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to differentiate variations within the general flora.
   Low species diversity characterizes both floras. Diversity indices for both assemblages are very similar, indicating essentially no difference in assemblage composition, despite the difference in edaphic conditions. The Bear Creek Coal wetlands show greater variation in species content, while the mineral-enhanced peat of the Black Creek Coal overlaps this species diversity within a slightly more restricted range of variation. Cluster analysis produced 5 stable clusters, whereas three dimensions of the NMDS analysis provided the best fit to explain the variation among the samples. The dimensions are interpreted as representing abundance of (1) arborescent lycopsids, (2) arborescent and climbing sphenopsids, and (3) pteridosperms. The plant community preserved within the elastic parting of the Black Creek Coal is comparable to that of the community found above the Bear Creek Coal. Hence, vegetation that colonized mineral-substrate soils in Early Pennsylvanian coastal lowlands, whether in peat or non-peat accumulating settings, are very similar. The dominance of pteridosperms in these depositional regimes appears to remain stable throughout the Early and Middle Pennsylvanian and port ends community replacements in the Late Westphalian D some 8-10 million years later.

AB Arctic winter precipitation is projected to increase with global warming, but some areas will experience decreases in snow accumulation. Although Arctic CH4 emissions may represent a significant climate forcing feedback, long-term impacts of changes in snow accumulation on CH4 fluxes remain uncertain. We measured ecosystem CH4 fluxes and soil CH4 and CO2 concentrations and C-13 composition to investigate the metabolic pathways and transport mechanisms driving moist acidic tundra CH4 flux over the growing season (Jun-Aug) after 18years of experimental snow depth increases and decreases. Deeper snow increased soil wetness and warming, reducing soil %O-2 levels and increasing thaw depth. Soil moisture, through changes in soil %O-2 saturation, determined predominance of methanotrophy or methanogenesis, with soil temperature regulating the ecosystem CH4 sink or source strength. Reduced snow (RS) increased the fraction of oxidized CH4 (Fox) by 75-120% compared to Ambient, switching the system from a small source to a net CH4 sink (21 +/- 2 and -31 +/- 1mgCH(4)m(-2)season(-1) at Ambient and RS). Deeper snow reduced Fox by 35-40% and 90-100% in medium- (MS) and high- (HS) snow additions relative to Ambient, contributing to increasing the CH4 source strength of moist acidic tundra (464 +/- 15 and 3561 +/- 97mgCH(4)m(-2)season(-1) at MS and HS). Decreases in Fox with deeper snow were partly due to increases in plant-mediated CH4 transport associated with the expansion of tall graminoids. Deeper snow enhanced CH4 production within newly thawed soils, responding mainly to soil warming rather than to increases in acetate fermentation expected from thaw-induced increases in SOC availability. Our results suggest that increased winter precipitation will increase the CH4 source strength of Arctic tundra, but the resulting positive feedback on climate change will depend on the balance between areas with more or less snow accumulation than they are currently facing.

AB Rapid climate change and intensified human activities have resulted in water table lowering (WTL) and enhanced nitrogen (N) deposition in Tibetan alpine wetlands. These changes may alter the magnitude and direction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, affecting the climate impact of these fragile ecosystems. We conducted a mesocosm experiment combined with a metagenomics approach (GeoChip 5.0) to elucidate the effects of WTL (-20cm relative to control) and N deposition (30kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes as well as the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that WTL reduced CH4 emissions by 57.4% averaged over three growing seasons compared with no-WTL plots, but had no significant effect on net CO2 uptake or N2O flux. N deposition increased net CO2 uptake by 25.2% in comparison with no-N deposition plots and turned the mesocosms from N2O sinks to N2O sources, but had little influence on CH4 emissions. The interactions between WTL and N deposition were not detected in all GHG emissions. As a result, WTL and N deposition both reduced the global warming potential (GWP) of growing season GHG budgets on a 100-year time horizon, but via different mechanisms. WTL reduced GWP from 337.3 to -480.1g CO2-eq m(-2) mostly because of decreased CH4 emissions, while N deposition reduced GWP from 21.0 to -163.8g CO2-eq m(-2), mainly owing to increased net CO2 uptake. GeoChip analysis revealed that decreased CH4 production potential, rather than increased CH4 oxidation potential, may lead to the reduction in net CH4 emissions, and decreased nitrification potential and increased denitrification potential affected N2O fluxes under WTL conditions. Our study highlights the importance of microbial mechanisms in regulating ecosystem-scale GHG responses to environmental changes.

AB Wetland buffers may play an important role in the retention of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus ( P) that can be released in large quantities from forestry operations. In this study, we investigated the retention capacity of N and P of wetland vegetation comparing the control area with two experimental areas within one site before and after N and P pulse ( 45 kg N and 15 kg P) lasting one growing season (ca. 150 d). N and P pulse caused a significant increase in the plant biomass and N and P content in the upper experimental area, which received most of the added nutrients. Added N and P was mainly retained in the above and below ground parts of E. vaginatum, especially in storage organs and roots which form a long-term sink for nutrients. Total N retention in the plant biomass during the first year after N and P treatment ranged from 25.3 kg ( equals to 126.7 kg N ha(-1)) in the upper experimental area to 6.1 kg (20.4 kg N ha(-1)) in the lower experimental area and 4.7 kg (15.7 kg N ha(-1)) in the control area. P retention ranged from 2.6 kg (13.1 kg P ha(-1)) in the upper experimental area to 1.0 kg (3.4 kg P ha(-1)) in the lower experimental area and 0.5 kg (1.8 kg P ha(-1)) in the control area. The retained proportions of N and P in the plant biomass in the two experimental areas were approximately 70% of the added N (45 kg N y(-1)) and approximately 25% of the added P (15 kg P y(-1)) during the first year after N and P addition in 1999. Our study shows that vigorously colonising and growing vegetation is the main factor in the retention of N, a significant factor in the retention of P in a constructed wetland buffer, and thus an important contributor to the prevention of detrimental effects of N and P leaching on watercourses.

AB The concentrations of uranium and thorium in ten partly nested streams in the boreal forest region were monitored over a two-year period. The investigated catchments ranged from small headwaters (0.1 km(2)) up to a fourth-order stream (67 km(2)). Considerable spatiotemporal variations were observed, with little or no correlation between streams. The fluxes of both uranium and thorium varied substantially between the subcatchments, ranging from 1.7 to 30 g km(-2) a(-1) for uranium and from 3.2 to 24 g km(-2) a(-1) for thorium. Airborne gamma spectrometry was used to measure the concentrations of uranium and thorium in surface soils throughout the catchment, suggesting that the concentrations of uranium and thorium in mineral soils are similar throughout the catchment. The fluxes of uranium and thorium were compared to a wide range of parameters characterising the investigated catchments and the chemistry of the stream water, e. g. soil concentrations of these elements, pH, TOC (total organic carbon), Al, Si and hydrogen carbonate, but it was concluded that the spatial variabilities in the fluxes of both uranium and thorium mainly were controlled by wetlands. The results indicate that there is a predictable and systematic accumulation of both uranium and thorium in boreal wetlands that is large enough to control the transport of these elements. On the landscape scale approximately 65-80% of uranium and 55-65% of thorium entering a wetland were estimated to be retained in the peat. Overall, accumulation in mires and other types of wetlands was estimated to decrease the fluxes of uranium and thorium from the boreal forest landscape by 30-40%, indicating that wetlands play an important role for the biogeochemical cycling of uranium and thorium in the boreal forest landscape. The atmospheric deposition of uranium and thorium was also quantified, and its contribution to boreal streams was found to be low compared to weathering.

AB Four lignite lithotypes (matrix coal, xylite-rich coal, mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal and mixture of matrix and xylite-rich coal), originating from the Kovin deposit, were investigated in detail. The paper was aimed to determine the main maceral, biomarker and isotopic (delta C-13) characteristics of investigated lithotypes. Based on these results the sources and depositional environment of organic matter in 4 lithotypes were established. These samples were also used as substrates for investigation of the influence of diagenetic alteration on delta C-13 signatures of biomarkers, as well as for assessment of the most convenient utilization for each lithotype. The investigated lithotypes differ in accordance with the composition of huminite macerals. Xylite-rich coal notably distinguishes from other lithotypes beacuse of the highest content of conifer resins vs. epicuticular waxes. The mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal is characterised by the greatest contribution of algae and fungi and the most intense methanotrophic activity at the time of deposition. In all coal lithotypes diagenetic aromatisation influenced isotopic composition of individual biomarkers. Xylite-rich coal has the poorest grindability properties. However, this coal lithotype is the most suitable for fluidized bed gasification, whereas the mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal has the lowest applicability for this process. The calorific value decreases in order: xylite-rich coal > matrix coal > mixture of matrix and xylite-rich coal > mixture of matrix and mineral-rich coal. The increase of organic carbon content and calorific value is controlled by the increase of contribution of wood vegetation vs. herbaceous peat-forming plants, as well as by stability of water table during peatification.

AB The hydrological cycle has significant effects on the terrestrial carbon (C) balance through its controls on photosynthesis and C decomposition. A detailed representation of the water cycle in terrestrial C cycle models is essential for reliable estimates of C budgets. However, it is challenging to accurately describe the spatial and temporal variations of soil water, especially for regional and global applications. Vertical and horizontal movements of soil water should be included. To constrain the hydrology-related uncertainty in modelling the regional C balance, a three-dimensional hydrological module was incorporated into the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon-budget model (InTEC V3.0). We also added an explicit parameterization of wetlands. The inclusion of the hydrological module considerably improved the model's ability to Simulate C content and balances in different ecosystems. Compared with measurements at five flux-tower sites, the model captured 85% and 82% of the variations in volumetric soil moisture content in the 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm depths during the growing season and 84% of the interannual variability in the measured C balance. The simulations showed that lateral subsurface water redistribution is a necessary mechanism for simulating water table depth for both poorly drained forest and peatland sites. Nationally, soil C content and their spatial variability are significantly related to drainage class. Poorly drained areas are important C sinks at the regional scale, however, their soil C content and balances are difficult to model and may have been inadequately represented in previous C cycle models. The InTEC V3.0 model predicted an annual net C uptake by Canada's forests and wetlands for the period 1901-1998 of 111.9 Tg C yr(-1), which is 41.4 Tg C yr(-1) larger than our previous estimate (InTEC V2.0). The increase in the net C uptake occurred mainly in poorly drained regions and resulted from the inclusion of a separate wetland parameterization and a detailed hydrologic module with lateral flow in InTEC V3.0.

AB We measured methane (CH4) emissions in the Luanhaizi wetland, a typical alpine wetland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, during the plant growth season (early July to mid-September) in 2002. Our aim was to quantify the spatial and temporal variation of CH4 flux and to elucidate key factors in this variation. Static chamber measurements of CH4 flux were made in four vegetation zones along a gradient of water depth. There were three emergent-plant zones (Hippuris-dominated; Scirpus-dominated; and Carex-dominated) and one submerged-plant zone (Potamogeton-dominated). The smallest CH4 flux (seasonal mean = 33.1 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) was, observed in the Potamogeton-dominated zone, which occupied about 74% of the total area of the wetland. The greatest CH4 flux (seasonal mean = 214 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) was observed in the Hippuris-dominated zone, in the second-deepest water area. CH4 flux from three zones (excluding the Carex-dominated zone) showed a marked diurnal change and decreased dramatically under dark conditions. Light intensity had a major influence on the temporal variation in CH4 flux, at least in three of the zones. Methane fluxes from all zones increased during the growing season with increasing aboveground biomass. CH4 flux from the Scirpus-dominated zone was significantly lower than in the other emergent-plant zones despite the large biomass, because the root and rhizome intake ports for CH4 transport in the dominant species were distributed in shallower and more oxidative soil than occupied in the other zones. Spatial and temporal variation in CH4 flux from the alpine wetland was determined by the vegetation zone. Among the dominant species in each zone, there were variations in the density and biomass of shoots, gas-transport system, and root-rhizome architecture. The CH4 flux from a typical alpine wetland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was as high as those of other boreal and alpine wetlands. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental changes due to global climatic changes will be a major issue for Canada during the 21st century. The effects of new climactic conditions are still difficult to assess. Global Circulation Models (GCM) simulate the effects of increased greenhouse gases on climate, but will need to be supplemented by Regional Climate Models (RCM) since their scale is not quite appropriate. Field controls such as instrumental climate records and glacier mass balance studies help refine model predictions. On a countrywide scale CCM's predict increased temperatures, but these are quite variable on a regional scale. Volume and distribution of wafer will be modified and increased aridity could be critical in some Prairie areas. Extreme events, which are not taken into account by GCMs, could be more frequent, with serious negative effects. Biomes will shift northward and the forest industry will have to adapt its practices quickly. These changes will also affect carbon cycles, due to increased decoy of forest biomass and also drying out of bogs. Warming trends will be even more accute in northern areas, and will provoke permafrost degradation, development of thermokarsts and soil instability. A sea-level rise is anticipated, which will make the coasts of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia vulnerable to submersion risks. Agriculture will have to adapt to an increased length of growing season, but also to dry spells, much more accute during summer time. The importance of climate change and its impacts on environment are still not well known, which hinders adaptive measures, but some economic sectors cannot really wait for an absolute certainty and must react now, which is the case of the forestry industry. Finally, social issues cannot be ignored. What will be the reaction of the population in the case where government promotes adaptation measures? How will the Canadian population welcome economic/environmental refugees coming from poor countries, which will be more affected than will Canada by climate change, with expected drops in food

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hydraulic performance of a full-scale on-site vertical-flow biofilter, consisting of a mixture of peat and carbon-containing ash, and a 500 m(3) equalization pond prior to the filter-system. The treatment plant was constructed to clean up leachate from an industrial mono-landfill that contained shredder residues of end-of-life vehicles and white goods. With the limited storage capacity of the equalization pond, peak loading rates exceeded up to five to six times the designed daily hydraulic load limit of the biofilter system. Such relatively short overloading events did not negatively affect the purification efficiency. To provide the designed annual irrigation rate on the biofilter of 97 m(3) day(-1) (or 133 mm day(-1)), with large seasonal variations in precipitation, a relatively large pond would be needed. Calculations showed that a storage volume of about 23000 m(3) would be sufficient for annual leachate volumes up to about 35000 m(3). A combination of sprinkler and drip irrigation with straw insulation of the latter made it possible to run the plant continuously even when the ambient air temperature was below zero for more than a month at a time. The grain size distribution of the biofilter medium was noticeably changed after 4 years of usage due to the loading of suspended solids from the leachate and decomposition of the peat, causing reduced hydraulic conductivity.

AB Recent studies have suggested that the marine contribution of methane from shallow regions and melting marine-terminating glaciers may have been underestimated. Here we report on methane sources and potential sinks associated with methane seeps in Cumberland Bay, South Georgia's largest fjord system. The average organic carbon content in the upper 8 m of the sediment is around 0.65 wt %; this observation combined with Parasound data suggest that the methane gas accumulations probably originate from peat-bearing sediments currently located several tens of meters below the seafloor. Only one of our cores indicates upward advection; instead most of the methane is transported via diffusion. Sulfate and methane flux estimates indicate that a large fraction of methane is consumed by anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Carbon cycling at the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) results in a marked fractionation of the delta C-13-CH4 from an estimated source value of -65 parts per thousand to a value as low as -96 parts per thousand just below the SMT. Methane concentrations in sediments are high, especially close to the seepage sites (similar to 40 mM); however, concentrations in the water column are relatively low (max. 58 nM) and can be observed only close to the seafloor. Methane is trapped in the lowermost water mass; however, measured microbial oxidation rates reveal very low activity with an average turnover of 3.1 years. We therefore infer that methane must be transported out of the bay in the bottom water layer. A mean sea-air flux of only 0.005 nM/m(2) s confirms that almost no methane reaches the atmosphere.

AB The origin of the organic matter (OM) and the characteristics of the paleoenvironment of Serbian brown coals covering a time-span from the Lower to the Upper Miocene were evaluated and compared based on comprehensive petrological and biomarker analyses. Investigated coals are typical humic coals. Peat-forming vegetation is characterized by abundant decay resistant gymnosperm (coniferous) plants, followed by variable amount of angiosperms. Coal forming plants belonged to the gymnosperm families Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Araucariaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Peatification proceeded in fresh water environment under variable Eh settings, from anoxic to slightly oxic condition. Upper Miocene lignites were formed in neutral to slightly acidic environment, whereas Lower and Middle Miocene coals were deposited under neutral to slightly alkaline, and more reductive conditions, which is the result of calcium-rich surface waters derived from the surrounding Jurassic to Cretaceous calcareous country rock and higher water column level. Diagenetic changes of the OM were governed by bacterial activity, rather than thermal alteration. Biomarker pattern does not significantly differ in Serbian coals of different ages. The main differences between Upper, Middle and Lower Miocene coals are expressed by higher Gelification Index (GI), proxy ratio (P-aq), n-C-23/(n-C-27 + n-C-31) and pimarane/16 alpha(H)-phyllodadane ratio, as well as lower relative abundance of C-31 alpha beta(R)-hopane of the latter one. OM of Lower Miocene coals is more mature, corresponding to immature/early mature stage (huminite/vitrinite reflectance similar to 0.45), whereas OM of Upper Miocene lignites is in immature diagenetic phase (huminite reflectance similar to 0.3). Consequently, higher gelification of Lower Miocene coals is probably an effect of higher rank, however high humidity/wet climate and low acidity within the mire could not be excluded. A good correlation between biomarker parameters and paleoclimate data is observed, indicating that biomarker patterns represent a valuable tool that reflect even slight paleoclimate changes in Serbia during Miocene.

AB An outcrop of the Duquesne Coal (Conemaugh Cyclothem) has the only significant occurrence of coal balls in Upper Pennsylvanian (Stephanian B equivalent) sediments of the Appalachian Basin. Excellent preservation of plant debris within autochthonous pear has permitted a more refined reconstruction of the source plant community than reported in published studies of other coals. Coal balls were quantitatively sampled for whole-plant species and mineralogical content. Shoot-root ratios were extremely high compared with values reported for other coals. The samples were analyzed using cluster analyses and non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) in order to differentiate microhabitats and stages of ecological succession within the general flora. Cluster analysis produced 5 stable clusters, which agreed with the sequence of ecological succession as determined in a previous study, and with microhabitat differentiation in contemporaneous seral stages. Three dimensions of the MDS analysis provided the best fit to the data. The dimensions are interpreted as representing: (1) ecological time or succession; (2) increasing dominance of Psaronius tree ferns in the plant community; and (3) an increase in microtopological variation (probably hummock formation). The initial stages of succession (oldest layers of permineralized peat) are characterized by aerial debris from Mesoxylon, Sigillaria and Calamites, followed by an assemblage dominated by Chaloneria. This was succeeded by more species diverse assemblage, dominated by Neuropteris seed ferns and Psaronius tree ferns, with numerous subcanopy plants, including lianas, epiphytes and ground herbs. Late seral stages (youngest layers of permineralized peat) were dominated by Psaronius tree ferns.

AB Soil gas production processes, mainly anaerobic or aerobic soil respiration, drive major gas fluxes across the soil-atmosphere interface. Carbon dioxide (CO2) effluxes, an efflux which in most ecosystems is a result of both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration, in particular have received international attention. The importance of both CO2 and methane (CH4) fluxes are emphasised in the Arctic because of the large amount of soil organic carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems and changes in uptake and release due to climate changes.
   This chapter focuses on controls on spatial and temporal trends in subsurface CO2 and CH4 production as well as on transport and release of gases from the soil observed in the valley Zackenbergdalen. A dominance of near-surface temperatures controlling both spatial and seasonal trends is shown based on data obtained using closed chamber and eddy-correlation techniques as well as in manipulated field plots and in controlled incubation experiments. Despite variable temperature sensitivities reported, most data can be fairly well fitted to exponential temperature-dependent equations. The water content (at wet sites linked to the depth to the water table) is a second major factor regulating soil respiration processes, but the effect is quite different in contrasting vegetation types. Dry heath sites are shown to be periodically water limited during the growing season and respond therefore with high respiration rates when watered. In contrast, water saturated conditions during most of the growing season in the fen areas hinder the availability of oxygen, resulting in both CO2 and CH4 production. Thus, water table drawdown results in decreasing CH4 effluxes but increasing CO2 effluxes.
   Additional controls on gas production are shown to be related to the availability of substrate and plant productivity. Subsurface gas production will produce partial and total pressure gradient causing gas transport, which in well-drained soils is mainly controlled by diffusion, whereas gas advection, bubbles and transport through roots and stems may be important in more saturated soils.
   Bursts of CO2 gas have been observed during spring thaw and confirmed in controlled soil thawing experiments. Field observations as well as experimental work suggest that such bursts represent partly on-going soil respiration and a physical release of gas produced during the winter. The importance of winter soil respiration is emphasised because of the fact that microbial respiration in Zackenberg samples is noted down to a least -18 degrees C. Hence, the importance of winter respiration and burst events in relation to seasonal and future climate trends requires more than just summer measurements. For example, the autumn period seems important as snowfall prior to low air temperature may insulate the soil, keeping soil temperatures high. This will extend the period of high soil respiration rates and thereby increase the importance of the winter period for the annual carbon balance.
   Because of the complexity of factors controlling subsurface gas production, we conclude that different parts of the landscape will respond quite differently to the same climate changes as well as that short-term effects are likely to be different from long-term effects.

AB Unsaturated floodplains and riverine, estuarine, and palustrine wetlands of coastal plain river valleys of central Delaware have mean loss-on-ignition (LOI) values of 2-9%, 9-13%, 17-21%, and 43-46%, respectively. These distinctive LOI signatures we used in conjunction with radiocarbon dates and Delaware's local relative sea-level curve to reconstruct the Holocene history of the valleys of the study ares. During the early Holocene, the sediment yield of the Delaware coastal plain was too low for rivers to build extensive subaerially exposed floodplains. Instead, organic-rich muds and peat accumulated in perennially inundated, non-tidal palustrine wetlands. These environments existed as long ago as 11,000 YBP, well before any possible influence of sea-level rise. The elevation of these deposits and Delaware's sea-level history suggest that tidal influence began 1,000-2,000 years ago. The transition from fluvial to estuarine conditions occurs without any lithologic change or discontinuity near the top of a uniform palustrine peat. Therefore, the base of the Holocene transgressive sequence is conformable in these valleys except where lateral migration by tidal streams has subsequently removed the conformable transition. Outside of the valleys, however, the base of the transgressive sequence is a major unconformity. Thus, the transgressive sequence preserved landward of the Delaware Bay coast is bounded at its base by a complex stratigraphic surface which is primarily conformable in valley fills but which is unconformable on paleointerfluves.

AB The cultivation of drug-type Cannabis sativa Lin. (C. sativa) employs a variety of rootzone systems, yet little is understood about rootzone-effects on plant physiology, inflorescence biomass, and cannabinoid potency. To determine if rootzone systems can affect C. sativa growth, physiology, and inflorescence biomass and phytochemicals, two C. sativa cultivars, colloquially known as 'Nordle' and 'Sensi-Star', were grown in three rootzone systems in a controlled environment. The three tested rootzone systems were: 1) an 11-litre pot containing a peat-based growing substrate, top fertigated with a synthetic fertilizer solution ("hydroponic"); 2) an 11-litre pot containing a peat-based growing substrate, top fertigated with aquaculture effluent solution ("aquaculture"); and 3) a 3-litre pot containing a custom made, predominantly peat-based growing substrate, with the lower portion of the roots submerged in a conventional aquaponics deep-water culture system ("aquaponics"). Throughout the experiment, plant growth (height, branch number, canopy volume), leaf-level physiological traits (e.g., chlorophyll) foliar mineral nutrition, and substrate physio-chemical properties were measured. At experimental completion, inflorescence yield (dry biomass) and potency (mass-based cannabinoid and terpene concentrations) were determined. Results revealed, significant rootzone-effects on most growth and physiological traits measured. Plants performed best in the in the hydroponic rootzone: e.g., producing 42-116% greater inflorescence biomass than the other rootzone systems. In contrast, however, Nordle plants in the aquaponics treatment had greater Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and the terpenes beta-pinene and limonene, relative to their congeners grown in the other rootzones investigated. Pronounced differences in substrate macro-nutrient availability and foliar nutrient content occurred among the rootzones, suggesting a potential mechanism to explain the observed growth, physiological, yield and potency responses. This work underscores the importance of the rootzone environment for the cultivation of C. sativa, specifically in indoor systems focused of medical or research production.

AB The increased demand for blueberries and limited availability of low-pH soils have led to the increased use of soilless culture systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a wide range of RNH4+ [RNH4+ = 100*N-NH4+/(N-NH4+N-NO3-)] values on the acidification of the growth medium and the nutrient status and performance of blueberry plants. RNH4+ treatments of 25% (AN25, control), 50% (AN50) and 100% (AN100) and a 25% N-NH4+ plus concentrated sulfuric acid (AN25-acid) treatment were applied by fertigation to southern high-bush blueberry plants (Vaccinium corymbosum, cv. Sunshine Blue) grown in a soilless substrate (50% tuff, 25% peat, 25% coconut coir). The original solution for the AN25-acid treatment was adjusted to a constant pH of 4.5. The pH and mineral concentrations in the leachate, pH of the growth medium and mineral and chlorophyll concentrations in the leaves were monitored periodically. Plant water uptake was monitored periodically and foliage volumes were calculated at the end of the growing season. Application of high levels of RNH4 decreased the pH of the leachate and medium to below 5.5 and increased the concentrations of Fe, Mn and Zn in the leachate, as compared to the control treatment. Those treatments also increased the chlorophyll concentrations, total plant water uptake, foliage volumes and leaf Mn concentrations relative to the control treatment. The effects of the high-RNH4+ treatment on acidification and plant performance were not significantly different from the effects of the commonly used AN25-acid treatment. It seems, therefore, that the increased RNH4+ reduced the pH of the growth medium to the required level for blueberry production, providing a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative to the use of sulfuric acid.

AB Thermokarst lakes, formed during permafrost thaw in Western Siberia Plain over past tens to hundreds years, cover overall territory close to million km(2) and may represent significant source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. These acidic (3 < pH < 6) and humic [10 < dissolved organic carbon (DOC) < 50 mg/L] lakes are essentially inhabited by heterotrophic bacterioplankton with rare phytoplankton bloom occurring during warm periods. In order to understand possible effects of phytoplankton bloom on thermokarst lake hydrochemistry under climate warming scenario, we cultured pure cyanobacterium (Gloeocapsa sp.) and native cyanobacterial associate separated from the natural lake water. As substrates, sterilized thermokarst lake water and peat leachate from western Siberia were used. In these laboratory microcosm experiments which lasted 10 days, we monitored daily pH, biomass, DOC, and 40 major and trace elements. Despite significant variation of pH (4 to similar to 10.5) and biomass (a factor of 3-5), very few dissolved elements responded to massive cyanobacterial growth. The DOC varied within a factor of 1.2-1.5, exhibiting slow increase due to exometabolite production in thermokarst lake water and an initial decrease due to photodegradation in peat leachate. Elements appreciably affected by photosynthesis in both lake water and peat leachate substrates were P, Zn, Mn, and, in a lesser degree, Cd, K, Rb, Sr, Ba, Cr, Al, and U. While P, K (Rb), Mn, and Zn removal from solution during cell growth could be linked to biological demand by cyanobacteria, the adsorption of Cd, Sr, Ba, Al, Cr, U on the cell surface in response to the pH rise is most likely. Many other trace elements did not exhibit any significant evolution of the concentration during 10-day experiment either due to their strong complexation with allochthonous organic matter and essentially organic/organo-mineral colloidal status (Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Pb, REEs, Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) or due to the lack of element interaction with cyanobacterial cells, via both adsorption and intracellular uptake (B, Si, V, Mo, As, Sb, Cs). Therefore, possible intensification of cyanobacterial bloom in thermokarst lakes caused by leaching of thawing peat will likely affect only few macronutrients and micronutrients such as P, K, Mn, and Zn, while the majority of trace elements bound to allochthonous DOC in the form of organic and organo-mineral colloids will not be affected by cyanobacterial biomass production and pH rise due to photosynthesis. Cyanobacterial bloom in organic-rich (20 mg DOC/L) thermokarst lakes exhibited significant potential of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere, which is more than an order of magnitude higher than the CO2 evasion due to heterotrophic plankton respiration of allochthonous DOC.

AB A new measuring technique based on a capillary rise method has been developed to quantify the wettability of more or less decomposed peats (the main materials used as horticultural growing media) in relation to their water content. A preliminary study of their physico-chemical and biochemical characteristics enabled us to study the variation of their physical properties (particularly their rewetting capacity) in relation to their degree of decomposition. Analysis of these physical properties during two drying and rewetting cycles showed that the greater their degree of decomposition, the greater and more irreversible was their shrinkage. The change from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity was measured by the increase of the water contact angle during desiccation and by the progressive change from bipolar to apolar surfaces. A strong correlation between the water retention of peats (related to their degree of decomposition) and their free energy (also called hydration energy) at the interface between solid and water DeltaG(SW) is also shown.

AB The long-term ecological success of compensatory freshwater wetland projects has come into question based on follow-up monitoring studies over the past few decades. Given that wetland restoration may require many years to decades to converge to desired outcomes, long-term monitoring of successional patterns may increase our ability to fully evaluate success of wetland mitigation projects or guide adaptive management when needed. In Portsmouth, New Hampshire a 4 ha wetland was constructed in an abandoned gravel quarry as off-site compensatory mitigation for impacts to a scrub-shrub swamp associated with property expansion. Building upon prior evaluations from 1992 and 2002, we conducted a floral survey in 2020 to compare results with prior surveys to document vegetation successional trends over time. In addition, we monitored the avian community throughout the growing season as a measure of habitat quality. The plant community mirrored documented successional trends of freshwater wetland restoration projects as native hydrophytes dominated species composition. Plant species composition stabilized as the rate of turnover, the measurement of succession, declined by nearly half after 17 years. Researchers should consider long-term monitoring of specific sites to better understand successional patterns of created wetlands as we documented long time frames required for the development of scrub-shrub swamps, red maple swamps, and sedge meadows. High species richness was attributed to beaver activity, topographic heterogeneity from Carex stricta tussocks, and the seed bank from the application of peat from the original wetland. Habitat heterogeneity of open water, herbaceous cover, and woody vegetation supports a diverse avian community including 11 wetland dependent species. Although the mitigation project has not created the full area of lost scrub-shrub swamp after 35 years, it has developed a structurally complex habitat and diverse avian community that effectively provides the functions and values of the impacted system.

AB Region 2 comprises arctic and subarctic North America and is underlain by continuous or discontinuous permafrost. Its freshwater systems are dominated by a low energy environment and cold region processes. Central northern areas are almost totally influenced by arctic air masses while Pacific air becomes more prominent in the west, Atlantic air in the east and southern air masses at the lower latitudes. Air mass changes will play an important role in precipitation changes associated with climate warming. The snow season in the region is prolonged resulting in long-term storage of water so that the spring flood is often the major hydrological event of the year, even though, annual rainfall usually exceeds annual snowfall. The unique character of ponds and lakes is a result of the long frozen period, which affects nutrient status and gas exchange during the cold season and during thaw. GCM models are in close agreement for this region and predict temperature increases as large as 4 degrees C in summer and 9 degrees C in winter for a 2 x CO? scenario. Palaeoclimate indicators support the probability that substantial temperature increases have occurred previously during the Holocene. The historical record indicates a temperature increase of >1 degrees C in parts of the region during the last century. GCM predictions of precipitation change indicate an increase, but there is little agreement amongst the various models on regional disposition or magnitude. Precipitation change is as important as temperature change in determining the water balance. The water balance is critical to every aspect of hydrology and limnology in the far north. Permafrost close to the surface plays a major role in freshwater systems because it often maintains lakes and wetlands above an impermeable frost table, which limits the water storage capabilities of the subsurface. Thawing associated with climate change would, particularly in areas of massive ice, stimulate landscape changes, which can affect every aspect of the environment. The normal spring flooding of ice-jammed north-flowing rivers, such as the Mackenzie, is a major event, which renews the water supply of lakes in delta regions and which determines the availability of habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate warming or river damming and diversion would probably lead to the complete drying of many delta lakes. Climate warning would also change the characteristics of ponds that presently freeze to the bottom and result in fundamental changes in their limnological characteristics. At present, the food chain is rather simple usually culminating in lake trout or arctic char. A lengthening of the growing season and warmer water temperature would affect the chemical, mineral and nutrient status of lakes and most likely have deleterious effects on the food chain. Peatlands are extensive in region 2. They would move northwards at their southern boundaries, and, with sustained drying, many would change form or become inactive, Extensive wetlands and peatlands are an important component of the global carbon budget, and warmer and drier conditions would most likely change them from a sink to a source for atmospheric carbon. There is some evidence that this may be occurring already. Region 2 is very vulnerable to global warming. Its freshwater systems are probably the least studied and most poorly understood in North America.
   There are clear needs to improve our current knowledge of temperature and precipitation patterns; to model the thermal behaviour of wetlands, lakes and rivers; to understand better the interrelationships of cold region rivers with their basins; to begin studies on the very large lakes in the region; to obtain a firm grasp of the role of northern peatlands in the global carbon cycle; and to link the terrestrial water balance to the thermal and hydrological regime of the polar sea. Overall there is a strong need for basic research and long-term monitoring. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A study was carried out in 2014-2016 at three comparable, representative areas of permanent grassland situated on organic soils within the Pasleka River valley, in Kiewry (53 degrees 53' N, 20 degrees 10' E, Poland) near Olsztyn. Soil samples were collected during the growing season from selected objects located at a distance of 50 m, 150 m and 300 m from the Pasleka River bank, which determined their use. Physicochemical properties were determined in the soil samples. The aim of the study was to assess the physicochemical properties of the soil in a selected area of the Dolina Rzeki Pasleki Natura 2000 site depending on the habitat conditions and land use. The factors that determined the use of organic soils at the site were the prevailing habitat conditions. At a high level of groundwater, which caused high soil moisture, a given site was used as natural meadow. However, at a low level of groundwater, which was associated with low soil moisture, it was intensively used as grassland for hay harvest. Peat and muck soils of moderate moorshification in the uppermost layers, covered with a natural meadow (occasionally mown) and situated 50 m away from the Pasleka River bank, were characterised by the highest total nitrogen and phosphorus content in all layers compared to the other objects. Correlational relationships between the current moisture content, soil air content and the soil abundance of general forms of macronutrients were determined by the location of a grassland in relation to the distance from the river and the depth of the organic layer within the soil profile. The results of the research obtained at the Natura 2000 Site called Dolina Rzeki Pasleki (the Pasleka River Valley) show that the land use variants do not affect the degradation of organic soils.

AB The depositional palaeoenvironment of the Neogene Achlada lignite deposit (western Makedonia, Greece) was deciphered with respect to the evaluation of the macro-petrographic characteristics, and the data resulted from coal petrographic analyses.
   The total thickness of the studied lignite seam is similar to 26 m and consists of organic and inorganic alternations. The macro-petrographic observations suggest extremely high contributions of woody-originated tissue (xylite) from a single tree type, among the lignite layers, whereas, numerous in situ stems and trunks were observed. The results of the coal petrographic analysis indicate the dominance of huminite (883 vol.%), whereas liptinite and inertinite show much lower values (11.0 vol.% and 0.7 vol.% respectively). High contribution of mineral matter is also observed in many cases. Ulminite types A and B are the most abundant macerals, whereas the content of ulminite B is followed by the xylite content. Facies modeling using maceral composition and maceral indices suggested the alternation of forest swamp and reed-moor environments where peat accumulated under highly-saturated and intensely-anoxic conditions. A terrestrial origin with wet forest to piedmont plain depositional conditions was suggested by the Gelification Index (GI) and Tissue Preservation Index (TPI) plot. A cross-plot of the ground water index (GWI) vs. the vegetation index (VI) suggested swamps under mesotrophic and rheotrophic hydrogeological conditions, where the dominant source for the peat was woody vegetation and vegetation high in preservation potential.
   The overall macro and micro characteristics of the Achlada lignite suggest a depositional palaeoenvironment that includes three independent parts: a) the main channel of a meandering river system; b) the floodplain area; and c) the oxbow lake. The establishment of telmatic/limnotelmatic conditions in this palaeoenvironment resulted in the formation of the entire Achlada lignite deposit, whereas numerous flood episodes interrupted the peat accumulation and resulted in the deposition of clay-rich sediments.

AB Using biomass to provide energy services is a strategically important option for increasing the global uptake of renewable energy. Yet the practicalities of accelerating deployment are mired in controversy over the potential resource conflicts that might occur, particularly over land, water and biodiversity conservation. This calls into question whether policies to promote bioenergy are justified. Here we examine the assumptions on which global bioenergy resource estimates are predicated. We find that there is a disjunct between the evidence that global bioenergy studies can provide and policymakers' desire for estimates that can straightforwardly guide policy targets. We highlight the need for bottom-up assessments informed by empirical studies, experimentation and cross-disciplinary learning to better inform the policy debate.

AB Thermokarst ponds are widespread in arctic and subarctic regions, but little is known about their temporal evolution prior to human observations. This paper presents a pioneer biostratigraphic study conducted at a subarctic site with limnologically contrasted ponds located on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay, Canada. Fossil diatom and visible near infrared (VNIR) derivative spectral analyses were performed on short sediment cores, confirming the occurrence of three distinct stratigraphic facies as already inferred from an anterior sedimentological study: a lacustrine upper facies (UF) and a marine lower facies (LF), separated by an organic-rich/peat transitional zone (TZ). Diatoms were almost absent from LF, but increased significantly in both TZ and UF. Identified diatom taxa were mainly benthic species (e.g. genera Fragilaria, Pinnularia), and their down-core distribution appeared to be related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and possibly pH conditions. Diatom-inferred DOC showed a decreasing trend towards the surface (potentially associated with an increase in pH), inverse to the general trend in this region, suggesting the action of other mechanisms on DOC, such as exhaustion of external inputs from limited catchments and the role of discontinuous peat layers (former surfaces of permafrost mounds) during the initial stages of pond formation. These bryophilous substrates in aerophilic habitats probably controlled diatom community composition. The combination of diatom and VNIR data revealed similar trends between (i) opal (amorphous silica) and diatom abundances; (ii) eukaryotic/prokaryotic algae ratio and anoxia or hypoxia in bottom waters; and (iii) limonite (iron oxide) and redox conditions in surface sediments. These findings indicate that diatom community changes and pond limnological evolution in the recent past were controlled mainly by autogenic processes (e.g. local vegetation/soil development, peat accumulation and erosion), rather than by allogenic forcing mechanisms (e.g. precipitation and temperature, geochemical leaching of the surrounding glaciomarine sediments).

AB The response of coastal systems to allogenic forcing factors is of interest to diverse research communities, including those interested in global change, sequence stratigraphy and modelling. Quaternary systems are of particular interest because they provide analogues for ancient rock records. To understand the processes responsible for the sedimentary evolution of estuarine systems, it is necessary to study as many fluvial systems as possible. The objective of this review of the sedimentary evolution of a coastal marsh is to describe the influence of glacial paleotopography on the record of climatic and sea-level changes. The Marais Vernier, located at the interface between the marine and fluvial parts of the estuary, is a part of the Lower Seine Valley wetland network, which formed after the Last Glacial Maximum. Previous studies have described the Holocene filling, which is composed of peat and detrital material deposited following climatic and sea-level changes. To understand the sedimentary evolution, a paleotopographical (based on drillings and electromagnetic surveys) and a chronological framework (based on radiocarbon dates) for the southern peat marsh were defined. The peat marsh paleotopography has three erosional surfaces. The S1 surface is the oldest and also the highest, topographically; the S2 surface is younger, wider, and incised below the S1 surface; the S3 surface, the youngest of the three, is narrow and deeply incised. Radiometric ages were considered on the basis of their geographical position in relation to the S3 surface. Prior to 7.5 ka cal BP, sediments accumulated only above the narrow area described by the S3 surface, at a rate of 5.5 mm yr(-1). After 7.5 ka cal BP, shortly after the flooding of the Seine estuary, sediments accumulated as peat deposits over the entire peat marsh at a rate of 3 mm yr(-1) in response to the sea-level rise. The palcotopography delimits the area of deposition during the Holocene, and thus plays a critical role in determining the vertical accretion rate expressed as a thickness: prior to 7.5 ka cal BP, the vertical accretion rate (5.5 mm yr(-1)) was less than that observed for the Seine estuary (6.8 mm yr(-1)). However, rate of sea-level rise and sediment supply, which also affects sediment accumulation rates, vary in northwestern Europe during the Holocene. Therefore, although the Marais Vernier is a good illustration of paleotopographic influence, the effects of autocompaction, sea level and sediment supply complicate efforts to quantify the degree to which it controls sediment accumulation.

AB Basal peat age-depth data from four salt-marsh sites located 500-1500 in south of the Eastern Border fault (EBF) near Branford, Connecticut, document an error envelope for the lower limit of relative mean high water (MHW) rise during the past 3300 yr. The long-term rate of relative lower-limit-MHW rise during the past 3000 yr (1.1 mm yr(-1)) corresponds with late Holocene rates of relative MHW rise found elsewhere in coastal Connecticut (0.9-1.2 min yr(-1)). This result invalidates repeated claims that multiple seismotectonic lowering of a crustal block towards the south has occurred along a segment of the EBF near Branford shortly after 815 cal yr BC and during the past 1200 yr and calls for a non-tectonic interpretation of biostratigraphic evidence of local short-term sea-level variations.

AB The sulfur cycle and its compartmental distribution within an atmosphere-plant-soil system was studied using a compartment model in the typical meadow Calamagrostis angustifolia wetland in the Sanjiang Plain Northeast China. The results showed that in the typical meadow C angustifolia wetland ecosystem, soil was the main storage compartment and current hinge of sulfur in which 98.4% sulfur was accumulated, while only 1.6% sulfur was accumulated in the plant compartment. In the plant subsystem, roots and litters were the main storage compartment of sulfur and they remained 83.5% of the total plant sulfur. The calculations of sulfur turnover through the compartments of the typical meadow C angustifolia wetland ecosystem demonstrated that the above-ground component took up 0.99 gS/m(2) from the root, of which 0.16 gS/m(2) was translocated to the roots and 0.83 gS/m(2) to the litter. The roots took in 1.05 gS/m(2) from the soil, subsequent translocation back to the soil accounted for 1.31 gS/m(2), while there was 1.84 gS/m(2) in the litter and the net transfer of sulfur to the soil was more than 0.44 gS/(m(2).a). The emission of H2S from the typical meadow C angustifolia wetland ecosystem to the atmosphere was 1.83 mgS/(m(2).a), while carbonyl sulfide (COS) was absorbed by the typical meadow C. angustifolia wetland ecosystem from the atmosphere at the rate of 1.76 mgS/(m(2).a). The input of sulfur by the rainfall to the ecosystem was 4.85 mgS/m(2) during the growing season. The difference between input and output was 4.78 mgS/m(2), which indicated that sulfur was accumulated in the ecosystem and may cause wetland acidify in the future.

AB The 1800-km2 Okavango alluvial fan of northern Botswana represents an unusual depositional setting in which peat-forming perennial swamps (6000 km2) occur in a region of aeolian and semi-arid sedimentation within an incipient graben of the East African Rift.  A channel system distributes water and sediment on the fan surface but cannot contain seasonal flood water, which spreads laterally from the channels through permeable channel margins, sustaining the flanking swamps.  All sediment introduced is deposited on the fan.  A detailed study of sediment movement and associated hydrological conditions in the channels was undertaken to examine sediment dispersal.  Bedload greatly exceeds suspended load (at least by a factor of four).  Vegetation and peat form permeable levees which confine the channels.  In the upper reaches, two-way exchange of water occurs between channel and swamp depending on the season, but on the fan itself, channels lose water to the swamp.  Bedload measurements reveal that the channel system is in a state of grade disequilibrium, with interspersed depositional and erosional reaches.  Deposition of most of the incoming bedload occurs on the upper portion of the fan in a meandering and anastomosed channel system, but on the midfan, deposition of bedload occurs by channel-bed aggradation, at a rate of up to 5 cm yr-1.  Further down slope, the channel enters a large lake where all remaining bedload is deposited.  The presently observed sedimentation patterns may be due to a recent disturbance of the fluvial system, either by avulsion or neotectonics.

AB The present study aims to elucidate the depositional environment of Seam I in the Megalopolis Basin, Southern Greece, using existing geological data supported by maceral and mineralogical analyses, as well as by natural radioactivity determinations. Very high pyrite and uranium contents and a very low tissue preservation index usually suggest a marine influence during deposition. In Seam 1, however, these features are most probably the result of a karstic aquifer supplying the palaeomire with sulphate-rich, neutral to weakly alkaline water. The pyrite formation and the U precipitation are attributed to the anaerobic conditions, which prevailed during peat accumulation. The petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data of the studied profile point to several changes in the surface runoff and the supply of clastic material during deposition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Known Early-Middle Miocene terrestrial strata of southern New Zealand are represented by alluvial plain and lacustrine sediments. A vertebrate fauna including fish, ducks, and crocodiles populated Lake Manuherikia, with abundant mussels, gastropods, and stromatolites occupying the near-shore areas of the lake. A diverse vegetation covered the surrounding broad fluvial plains that extended to the coastal margins. Initially this was largely rainforest, which varied according to habitat and to changing climate. In particular, the climate and ecology appear to have fluctuated across the two major thresholds of fire/no-fire and of peat accumulation and no-peat. A major climate change, possibly the sharp global deterioration in conditions at about 14 Ma, profoundly changed the vegetation. Rainforest continuity fragmented, and herblands became widespread. Leaf fossils effectively disappear from the record at this time.

AB Radiocarbon dates from peats within and below coastal dune sands at Opinan and Redpoint, Wester Ross, Scotland, provide age constraints on phases of peat accumulation, dune development, and podzolic soil formation. Although the two dune systems are only 4 km apart they do not share identical histories of landsurface stability and aeolian sand deposition. Most dune building occurred as relative sea level (RSL) was falling but because the dunes are perched on glacifluvial terraces several metres above RSL maximum, the creation of accommodation space consequent upon RSL fall was not a prerequisite for dune development. Some dune phases also correspond in timing with documented climate shifts to cooler, wetter and/or stormier conditions - in the Little lee Age 400 cal. years BP, around 2500 cal. years BP, and at about 8 100 cal. years BP. Preliminary estimates of the rate of podzolic soil development are similar to those reported for aeolian sandy parent materials elsewhere.

AB Studies of the saprotrophic growth dynamics of Trichoderma species and their fungal hosts during antagonistic interactions are severely hampered by the absence of methods that allow the unambiguous identification and quantification of individual genera in complex environments such as soil or compost containing mixed populations of fungi. Furthermore, methods are required that allow discrimination between active hyphal growth and other components of fungal biomass such as quiescent spores that are produced in large numbers by Trichoderma species. This study details the use of monoclonal antibodies to quantify the saprotrophic growth dynamics of the soil-borne plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani and biological control strains of Trichoderma asperellum and Trichoderma harzianum during antagonistic interactions in peat-based microcosms. Quantification was based on the immunological detection of constitutive, extracellular antigens that are secreted from the growing tip of Rhizoctonia and Trichoderma mycelium and, in the case of Trichoderma harzianum, from quiescent phialoconidia also. The Trichoderma-specific monoclonal antibody (MF2) binds to a protein epitope of the enzyme glucoamylase, which was shown by immunofluorescence and immunogold electron gold microscopy studies of Trichoderma virens in vitro to be produced at the origin of germ tube emergence in phialoconidia and from the growing tip of germ tubes. In addition, a non-destructive immunoblotting technique showed that the enzyme was secreted during active growth of Trichoderma asperellum mycelium in peat. The Rhizoctonia solani-specific monoclonal antibody (EH2) similarly binds to a protein epitope of a glycoprotein that is secreted during active mycelial growth. Extracts derived from lyophilized mycelium were used as a quantifiable and repeatable source of antigens for construction of calibration curves. These curves were used to convert the absorbance values obtained in ELISA tests of peat extracts to biomass equivalents, which allowed comparisons of the saprotrophic growth dynamics of the pathogen and antagonists to be made in single or mixed species microcosms. Trichoderma species were able to compete successfully with R. solani for nutrients and to prevent saprotrophic growth of the pathogen. Specificity of the Trichoderma quantitative assay was tested in non-sterile soil-based microcosms artificially inoculated with T. asperellum. The assay was highly specific and only detected T. asperellum population dynamics. No cross-reactivity was found with extracts from soil samples containing contaminant fungi.

AB The ability of spontaneous vegetation to recolonise a Mediterranean peatland was investigated to assess the combined effect of rewetting and topsoil removal on restoration of a drained area. The experiment tested the concept of converting the cultivated area into a constructed wetland system (CWS) of five cells. A mixed approach was used based on orthophotos from an unmanned aerial vehicle, phytosociological surveys, and destructive samplings performed during the fourth summer after the CWS set-up. Two spontaneous species dominated: Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. and Typha latifolia L.. Distance of the CWS from the inlet influenced the biomass yield of P. australis, which progressively decreased (from 7.81 to 3.87 kg/m(2)) and thus influenced other parameters, such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake per unit area (from 153 to 74 g N/m(2), from 13 to 7 g P/m(2)). Typha latifolia, with a mean production of 3.58 kg/m(2) (in the last two (4th and 5th) CWS cells), took up 51 g N/m(2) and 6 g P/m(2). From these data, we determined that plants took up 1144 kg of N and 103 kg of P in their aboveground biomass and were able to store nearly 25% of the nutrient loads yearly.

AB Two energy plants common osier (Salix viminalis L.) and black poplar (Populus nigra L.) were investigated in order to evaluate their productivity, to perform an energy growing analysis and to investigate plant physical-mechanical and energetic properties of chopped plants for biofuel production. The field experiments were conducted at the Vezaiciai branch of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry (Western Lithuania, 55 degrees 432 N, 21 degrees 282 El. The average common osier's yield was 7720 t ha(-1) of dry matter (DM), and that of black poplar was 4228 t ha(-1) DM. A 3.0 t ha(-1) liming rate and 60 kg ha(-1) N rate was optimal for both crops growth and DM productivity.
   Common osier and black poplar chaff's elemental composition analysis showed a similar C (carbon) content of 49.1-49.7%, H (hydrogen) content of 5.6-5.8%, N (nitrogen) and S (sulphur) in small volume %. The estimated ash content of the investigated plants was relatively low - from 1.44% for willows to 2.52%, for poplars. The lower calorific value of these plants' dry chaff was relatively high (18.49-18.62 MJ/kg). Depending on the different liming and nitrogen fertilization rates, the total energy input (including direct and indirect inputs) to the growing process constituted 8.41-29.21 G7 ha(-1). Common osier had the highest energy output (from 1030 to 1639 G7 ha(-1)) and the highest energy use efficiency (46.01-122.47).

TI Determination of optimal fertilizer concentration range for tomatoes

AB For optimum plant growth in containers, adequate plant nutrition is essential. Objectives of this research were to determine the optimum fertilization of tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) in a peat-based medium and to assess plant nutrition by plant and media analysis. Tomato seedlings ('Heinz 1437') were transplanted (one plant per pot) into 2-liter pots filled with a peat-based medium. The medium was fertilized with a progressive array of soluble fertilizers to supply N from 0 to 200 mg L-1 of solution with accompanying proportional increases of other macronutrients with each increase in nitrogen (N) (P from 0 to 44; K from 0 to 160; Ca from 0 to 200, and Mg from 0 to 48 mg L-1). The plants were irrigated starting with 100mL of fertilizer solution per day and increasing to 200 mL per day as plant growth progressed. The tomatoes were harvested at three stages of growth (5-leaf stage, flower initiation, and fruit formation) for analysis of growth and composition. Samples of medium for nutrient analysis were taken at each growth stage. Plant biomass increased linearly as fertilizer level increased or as time progressed. Generally, concentration of extractable nutrients in the medium increased linearly with increases in nutrients in the solutions. However, as time progressed, N concentrations in medium rose, but phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) in the medium fell. Concentrations of N, P, or K in leaves increased as nutrition increased, but Mg or Ca in leaves had no significant changes with increased nutrient supply. With time the N, P, Ca, and Mg concentration in tissues fell, but K rose. Assessment of plant nutrition was best at flower initiation, with assessments at the other stages of development being judged as untimely or excessively variable. For maximum growth, critical concentrations of nutrients in the medium (mg kg(-1)) at flower initiation were judged to be 30 NO3-N, 30 P, 300 K, 2600 Ca, and 800 Mg and in leaves (g kg(-1)) to be 35 N, 10 P, 70 K, 35 Ca, and 20 Mg. Fertilization to reach these critical concentrations was reached in the regime with 100mg NL-1 or higher levels of nutrition.

AB The aim of the research was to analyze and evaluate both growth and physiological features of corn, cultivated in various solis and fertilised with sewage sludge. The present study investigates the effect of manuring on energy plant development, especially those cultivated on low-quality soils, and the usefulness of Phytotoxkit test in predicting the efficiency of such a treatment. Sand as well as various types of soil, e.g. sandy, peat or clay, were enriched with 10-15% doses of sewage sludge which, to a large extent, influenced the growth of plants. Moreover, their biomass and chlorophyll a and b content increased, and photosynthesis, membrane stability and RNase activity in leaves were considerably improved. As far as Phytotoxkit is concerned, it appears that it might be useful when predicting the development of fertilized plants.

ID GROWTH; ZONES
AB Coal seams within the Waikato Coal Measures can vary significantly (>50%) in thickness over short lateral distances (<500 m). Normal faulting during coal-measure deposition could produce the observed variations in seam thicknesses, but the timing of faulting has not been determined precisely. To constrain the timing of faulting, and its potential impact on coal seam geometry, we have analysed displacements for nine normal faults striking both NNW to N and NNE to NE. Displacements were derived from drillholes, mine workings, and seismic reflection lines. The data indicate that normal faulting occur-red after peat accumulation in the coal measures, in some cases perhaps commencing in the latest Eocene to early Oligocene (i.e., c. 33-36 Ma). Normal faulting had little or no impact on the accumulation of peat in the Waikato Coal Measures. Variations in coal-seam thickness were controlled by basement paleotopography and fluctuations in sediment supply.

AB Common practices and several studies have demonstrated the positive effect of biochar amendment on climate change mitigation, soil properties, and plant growth. We performed a greenhouse experiment to assess the potential of wood biochar to improve the properties of the growing media and the growth of seedlings in boreal tree species. We added willow biochar (0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) to raw peat and measured the growth of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) seedlings. In addition, the co-effect of biochar amendment with 0%, 50%, and 100% fertilization was estimated. We found that using up to 10% of biochar did not reduce the water retention capacity of the growing media significantly. Moreover, biochar amendment significantly increased carbon, nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus concentrations and had a significant liming effect on the growing media. The biochar amendment increased the aboveground growth of spruce seedlings and root biomass, as well as the root collar diameter, of birch seedlings. Biochar amendment did not affect the quality of seedlings, estimated by the Dickson's quality index, for spruce and pine, while the quality of birch increased. Based on our results, biochar has potential in forest seedling production.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the optimal conditions for spore germination, prothallus propagation, sporophyte formation and seedling growth in Microlepia strigosa (Thunb.) C. Presl. Spore germination and prothallus development were promoted by low concentrations of Knop medium nutrient solution. The optimal medium for prothallus propagation and antheridium formation was 2X MS medium with 3% sucrose. The activated charcoal content of the medium did not affect prothallus proliferation. Among the various combinations of culture soil (bedding soil, peat moss, perlite and decomposed granite), a mixture of bedding soil, peat moss and decomposed granite at a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 (v : v : v) had a positive effect on sporophyte formation. The most efficient conditions for promoting the growth of whole plants (sporophyte seedlings) were 50 - cell plug trays filled with a mixture of bedding soil and decomposed granite at a 2 : 1 (v : v) ratio.

AB The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of P sources and filter cake, enriched or not with biofertilizers and liquid peat, on the microbial population and the soil available P levels and shoot dry matter and P accumulation by sugarcane. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement 4 x 3 + 1 and three replications. The treatments consisted in four sources of P: simple superphosphate, triple superphosphate, monoammonium phosphate and reactive natural phosphate combined with three levels of organic compound: without filter cake, decomposed filter cake (30 t ha(-1), dry basis) and decomposed filter cake enriched with liquid peat (4 mL kg(-1)of filter cake) and biofertilizers (480 mL kg(-1)of filter cake) and a control treatment without organic compound and without phosphorus. At 45 and 110 days after planting the total population of bacteria and fungi, phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms and total microorganisms were evaluated. After 60 and 110 days, the soil available P, plants' P and dry matter and P accumulation were evaluated. The organic compound increased the population of soil microorganism, the soil P levels, the accumulation of P and dry matter by the plants, regardless of the source of P, although the enrichment with biofertilizer and liquid peat did not enhance this effect. In conclusion, the presence of organic compost enhances the effects of phosphate fertilization.

AB Humic acids from highly decomposed peat were subjected to oxidation with alkaline cupric oxide (CuO) at 170 degreesC (single oxidation). Oxidation products were isolated as three fractions, oxidized humic acids, fulvic acids and lipophilic compounds. Isolated oxidized humic acids were subsequently re-oxidized (sequential oxidation) under the same conditions, and released lipophilic compounds were isolated. Lipids released during single and sequential oxidations were determined using capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Identified compounds accounted for 3.3 and 0.12 wt. % of humic acid content, respectively. Lipid profiles of lipophilic fractions released during single and sequential oxidation were markedly different. Lipids released by single oxidation contained triterpenoids (83%), shorter-chain fatty acids (11%) and beta -sitosterol (6%). In contrast, sequential oxidation released various diterpenoid acids (53%) of coniferous resin origin, various unsaturated C-18 fatty acids (20%), and a series (C-22-C-34) Of n-alkanes (20%). The consistent distribution of n-alkane fraction with a minor predominance of even-chain homologues (CPI 0.95), a high proportion (77%) of dehydroabietic acid and its degradation products, and a high preponderance of abietane over pimarane structures in the diterpenoid acid fraction all indicate substantial microbial activity within the humic acid matrix. Since polyfunctional compounds were predominant in monomeric lipids released from humic acids, the current data indicate that these compounds may potentially bind to humic acids at two or more points.

AB Some studies have reported that spring warming and earlier snowmelt leads to increased CO2 sequestration in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. We measured tundra-atmosphere CO2 exchange via eddy covariance at two low Arctic sites (mixed upland tundra and sedge fen) in central Canada over multiple snow-free periods to assess this hypothesis. Both sites were net sinks for atmospheric CO2 in all years (2004-2010), but with high interannual variability. Despite a large range in snowmelt date (30 days), we did not find a statistically significant correlation between seasonal accumulated net ecosystem production (NEP) and snowmelt for either site. Although many factors can influence seasonal total NEP, our analysis shows that annual variations in photosynthetic capacity, likely driven by changes in leaf area, is a dominating control at these Arctic sites. At the upland tundra site, protection of overwintering buds by a longer duration of deep snow appears to be linked to greater photosynthetic capacity and NEP. Whereas at the fen site, sedge growth benefits from earlier snowmelt resulting in a strong correlation with early season NEP and an increase in total study period NEP with increasing growing degree days. These results highlight the complexity of interannual variation in ecosystem CO2 exchange in Arctic tundra and suggest that snowmelt date alone cannot predict seasonal, or annual, NEP.

AB Soil organic matter contains various organic compounds and plays an important role in the circulation of organic carbon (SOC) and affects the quality of soils. Soil carbon loss via soil erosion and slope processes results in SOC variations along the slope. Deposition of silt and clay on peat-muck soils protects them from mineralization of organic carbon compounds and release of CO2 to ambient air. Slope processes occurring in northeastern Poland contribute to the reduction of SOC in eroded soils and sequestration of carbon in deluvial soils, mucky soils, and peat-muck soils. The pool of SOC and the lability of carbon can be used to assess the quality of soil in various conditions on the basis of the carbon management index (CMI). In the studied landscapes, the values increased down the slope and reached higher values in the soils covered with grasslands.

AB In the examined part of central Poland, there are numerous kettle-hole basins filled with mineral and biogenic sediments of the Eemian Interglacial and Early Weichselian. These basins are located in varied geological and geomorphological locations with variable thicknesses of the sediments and deposits. The infillings were investigated by lithological and palaeobotanic methods. Lithology of the biogenic sediments is diverse, primarily gyttja and peat, but also organic silt. A number of the documented sites contain a record of environmental changes throughout the glacial-interglacial cycle from the end of the Warta Stadial (Saalian) to Early Weichselian. Local geological, geomorphological and hydrological conditions influenced the possibility of continuous peat-lake accumulation and the timing of the completion of this accumulation. Biogenic sediments are covered with the Middle and Late Weichselian mineral sediments which indicate climatic changes and are the main reason for rapid and synchronic degradation of kettle-hole infillings.

AB When the last chemical elements were successfully measured by mass spectrometry its use for the characterisation of isotopes declined, but its use for chemical analysis and research grew. This new field of activity was aided by the emergence of commercially manufactured sector mass spectrometers designed for the analysis of oil refinery gases. Although the 1940s saw the use of mass spectrometry dominated by the petroleum industry it also saw many developments in its application to chemical analysis. By the early 1950s heated inlet systems were allowing spectra of all kinds of volatile organic compounds to be obtained. The 1950s saw the development of accurate mass measurement of organic molecules as a means of determining their elemental composition. This led to a demand for higher resolution double focusing instruments. Two types of design competed for this application, each with their perceived advantages and disadvantages. It was another decade, following the application of computers to high throughput accurate mass measurement, before one of these came to dominate. Double focusing sector instruments also enhance the information afforded by "metastable" ions, allowing identification of precursor and product ions. This led to the developments of Collision Induced Decompositions, MIRES and "linked scans". The mass range demanded of mass spectrometers jumped to new levels with the development of Fast Atom Bombardment (FAB). This led to new sector designs incorporating innovative new magnets. The success of FAB as a soft ionisation technique meant it produced little fragmentation and structural information. This led to a growth in the use of tandem MS/MS instrumentation as a tool for determining structures. This paper recounts these and many other developments which kept magnetic sectors at the centre of major new developments in mass spectrometry for chemical analysis and research for so long.

AB The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GDS) is a forested peatland that provides a number of ecosystem services including carbon (C) sequestration. We modeled and analyzed the potential capacity of the GDS to sequester C under four management scenarios: no management, no management with catastrophic fire, current management, and increased management. The analysis uses the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator developed for the GDS to estimate net ecosystem C balance. The model simulates net C gains and losses on an annual time-step from 2013 through 2062 which is converted to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) and monetized using the Interagency Working Group's Social Cost of Carbon. Our analysis incorporates compounded uncertainty including variation in ecological processes, temporal and spatial heterogeneity, and uncertainty in the discount rate. The no management scenario results in 2.4 million tons of CO2 emissions with a Net Present Value (NPV) under a 3% discount rate of -$67 million. No management with catastrophic fires emits 6.5 million tons of CO2 with an NPV of - $232 million. Current management avoids 9.9 million tons of emissions (via sequestration) with an NPV of $326 million. Increased management avoids 16.5 million tons of emissions with an NPV of $524 million.

AB In the past several decades, there has been considerable interest in groundwater-surface water interactions and their ability to regulate and cycle nutrients and pollutants. These interactions are spatially and temporally complex; however, electrical resistivity imaging can be a useful tool for their characterization. Here, an electrical resistivity imaging monitoring array was installed laterally across a groundwater-dominated Chalk river and into the adjacent riparian wetland; data were collected over a period of 1 year. Independent inversions of data from the entire transect were performed to account for the changing river stage and river water conductivity. Additionally, data from just the riparian zone were inverted using a temporally constrained inversion algorithm and the correlation between the riparian zone resistivity patterns and river stage was assessed using time-series analysis. The river stage and the Chalk groundwater level followed similar patterns throughout the year, and both exhibited a sharp drop following cutting of the in-stream vegetation. For the independent inversions, fixing the river resistivity led to artifacts, which prevented reliable interpretation of dynamics in the riverbed. However, the resistivity structure of the riparian zone coincided well with the intrusively derived boundary between the peat and the gravel present at the field site. Time-series analysis of the inverted riparian zone models permitted identification of seven units with distinct hydrological resistivity dynamics (five zones within the peat and two within the gravel). The resistivity patterns in the gravel were predominantly controlled by up-welling of resistive groundwater and the down-welling of more conductive peat waters following the river vegetation cutting event. In comparison, although the vegetation cutting influenced the resistivity dynamics in the peat zones, the resistivity dynamics were also influenced by precipitation events and increasing pore-water conductivity, likely arising from biological processes. It is anticipated that the distinct hydrological units are results of the complex fluvial history of the site. It is evident that such approaches combining electrical resistivity imaging and time-series analysis are useful for understanding the spatial extent and timing of hydrological processes to aid in the better characterization of groundwater-surface water interactions

AB Humic substances dissolved in groundwater may adsorb to certain mineral surfaces, rendering hydrophilic surfaces hydrophobic and making them sorbents for hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC). The sorption of humic and fulvic acids (International Humic Substances Society, IHSS, reference samples) on hematite and kaolinite was investigated to determine how natural organic coatings influence HOC sorption. The sorption behavior of the humic substances was consistent with a ligand-exchange mechanism, and the amount of sorption depended on the concentration of hydroxylated surface sites on the mineral and the properties of the humic substance. The sorption of the humic substances to two solids was proportional to their aromatic carbon content and inversely proportional to the O/C ratio. Increasing quantities of sorbed humic substances (f(oc), 0.01-0.5%) increased the sorption of carbazole, dibenzothiophene and anthracene. Peat humic acid, the most aromatic coating, showed the greatest sorption enhancement of HOC when sorbed to hematite. In addition, HOC sorption was greater on organic coatings formed at low ionic strength (I = 0.005) as compared to higher ionic strength (I = 0.1). We suggest that both the mineral surface and the ionic strength of the electrolyte affect the interfacial configuration of the sorbed humic substance, altering the size or accessibility of hydrophobic domains on the humic molecule to HOC.

AB Riverside wetland in the lower reaches of Songhua River has suffered intense damage resulting in rapid degeneration of the water purification system related to human destruction and water pollution. Violent fluctuations in water levels may lead to worsening water quality effects and destruction of plant growth. Ecological floating beds provide an effective way to overcome the problems, yet limited information regarding Sphagnum purification has been obtained in the open water environment. The ability of Sphagnum survival and its correlation to nutrients enrichment in violently fluctuating riverside wetland water as applied to the ecological floating bed are investigated in this study. Ecological floating beds, with Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum squarossum, were chosen for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment. The results indicated that changes of water quality (high N low P, low N high P) resulting from water level fluctuations in test areas were beneficial for the survival of Sphagnum species, especially in flood periods that high carbon content of water could effectively stimulate the growth of Sphagnum species. Following four months of field tests, the amounts of N and P enrichment in Sphagnum squarossum were 2.29 and 0.82 mg/g dry weight, respectively, while in Sphagnum fallax were 1.98 and 0.64 mg/g dry weight. N enrichment was superior to P for both Sphagnum moss types. The release of nutrients, especially P, can be controlled effectively by harvesting Sphagnum species in early winter. This study could be useful for improved understanding of water restoration in violent fluctuating degraded riverine wetland by eutrophic Sphagnum mosses.

TI An in situ occurrence of coal balls in the Amburgy coal bed, Pikeville
   Formation (Duckmantian), central Appalachian Basin, USA
SO PALAIOS
LA English
DT Article
ID EASTERN KENTUCKY; EURAMERICA; MODELS; SWAMP
AB Carbonate concretions containing permineralized pest, commonly called coal balls, were encountered in the Amburgy coal, a generally low-ash (9.4 %) but commonly high-sulfur (3.6 %) Middle Pennsylvanian coal of the Eastern Kentucky Coal Field. These are the first coal balls from the Amburgy coal, and one of only a few reported occurrences fi om the central Appalachian Basin. The coal balls occur in the upper part of the coal, between two paleochannel cutouts at the top of the Pikeville Formation, and immediately beneath a scour with a marine fossil lag at the base of the Kendrich Shale Member, Hyden Formation. The coal is thickest (1.3 m) in a narrow (<300 m) elongate depression between the bounding paleochannels, and thins toward the occurrence of coal balls. Total biovolume as measured from acetate peels of coal balls indicates cordaites or lycopsid (36.1 % each) dominance. Vertical sampling through one coal-ball aggregate shows zoning from a lower cordites-dominant (88.7%) assemblage, to a middle, degraded sphenopsid-rich assemblage, to an upper lycopsid-dominant (88.6%) assemblage. Beneath the coal balls, palynologic and petrographic analyses indicate the basal and middle portions of the bed are dominated by arborescent lycopsid spores and cordaites pollen, and by vitrinite macerals. The top part of the bed above the coal balls, contains increased inertinite macerals, increased percentages of small fern spares, and variable ash yield (5-21%).
   Thickening of the Amburgy coal along a structural low, in combination with basal high-ash yields, vitrinite-dominance, and heterogenous palynoflora, indicate paleotopographic control on initial peat accumulation. Abundant lycopsid spores in the basal and middle part of the coal reflect rheotrophic conditions consistent with accumulation in a paleotopographic depression. Apparent zonation preserved in one of the coal-ball masses may document plant successions in response to flooding. Similar percentages of cordaites and lycopods, respectively, in the zones above and below the degraded incursion interval reflect development of a mixed successional pattern, in response to the flooding. Coal-ball formation. may have been facilitated by channeling along the Kendrick ravinement, within a paleotopographic depression at the split margin of the Amburgy peat, either through direct transmittal of carbonates and marine waters into the peat, or through degassing of the peat beneath the scour.

AB Twenty-eight samples of peat, peaty lignites and lignites (of both matrix and xylite-rich lithotypes) and subbituminous coals have been physically activated by pyrolysis. The results show that the surface area of the activated coal samples increases substantially and the higher the carbon content of the samples the higher the surface area.
   The adsorption capacity of the activated coals for NO, SO2, C3H6 and a mixture of light hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10) at various temperatures was measured on selected samples. The result shows a positive correlation between the surface area and the gas adsorption. In contrasts the gas adsorption is inversely correlated with the temperature. The maximum recorded adsorption values are: NO=8.22x10(-5) mol/g at 35 degrees C; SO2=38.65 x 10(-5) mol/g at 60 degrees C; C3H6=38.9x 10(-5) mol/g at 35 degrees C; and light hydrocarbons= 19.24x 10(-5) mol/g at 35 degrees C. Adsorption of C3H6 cannot be correlated with either NO or SO2. However, there is a significant positive correlation between NO and SO2 adsorptions. The long chain hydrocarbons are preferentially adsorbed on activated lignites as compared to the short chain hydrocarbons.
   The results also suggest a positive correlation between surface area and the content of telohuminite maceral subgroup above the level of 45%. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying the main drivers of tree height growth on reclaimed oil sands sites of northern Alberta can provide useful information on what can be done to shorten the recovery time of these disturbed sites. The effect of water availability, foliar nutrient concentrations, competition, and soil chemical properties on young trembling aspen and white spruce height across two soil types (peat-mineral mix and forest floor-mineral mix) and two fertilizer levels (200 kg NPK ha(-1) and no fertilizer) was examined. For comparison, we also studied a natural site that burned the same year the reclaimed site was established. On the reclaimed site, peat-mineral soil had the greatest tree height for both species, though not by a significant margin in the case of white spruce. The fertilizer treatment had no apparent effect on tree height on the forest floor-mineral soil and a negative effect on the peat-mineral soil. Fertilization increased vegetation cover on both soil types, which, when combined with the negative or lack of durable effect of fertilization on tree height, suggest that the increase in competition for resources could have had a stronger effect on tree height than the increase in immediately available nutrients following fertilization. The majority of tree height growth drivers found were related to nutrient availability and, as far as we can tell, did not significantly differ between reclamation soil types. Aspen sucker height on the burned site was not strongly correlated to the measured variables, suggesting that suckers do not yet fully rely on their environment for height growth.

AB The ecosystems of the western Antarctic Peninsula, experiencing amongst the most rapid trends of regional climate warming worldwide, are important "early warning" indicators for responses expected in more complex systems elsewhere. Central among responses attributed to this regional warming are widely reported population and range expansions of the two native Antarctic flowering plants, Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis. However, confirmation of the predictions of range expansion requires baseline knowledge of species distributions. We report a significant southwards and westwards extension of the known natural distributions of both plant species in this region, along with several range extensions in an unusual moss community, based on a new survey work in a previously unexamined and un-named low altitude peninsula at 69 degrees 22.0'S 71 degrees 50.7'W in Lazarev Bay, north-west Alexander Island, southern Antarctic Peninsula. These plant species therefore have a significantly larger natural range in the Antarctic than previously thought. This site provides a potentially important monitoring location near the southern boundary of the region currently demonstrated to be under the influence of rapidly changing climate trends. Combined radiocarbon and lead isotope radiometric dating suggests that this location was most likely deglaciated sufficiently to allow peat to start accumulating towards the end of the 19th century, which we tentatively link to a phase of post-1870 climate amelioration. We conclude that the establishment of vegetation in this location is unlikely to be linked to the rapid regional warming trends recorded along the Antarctic Peninsula since the mid-20th century.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB The productivity and decomposition of Baumea juncea and Gleichenia dicarpa were measured at two sites at Kaitoke Swamp, Great Barrier Island, New Zealand, to determine their annual biomass dynamics. These interactions, including resulting peat accumulation, are poorly understood, especially for wetland sedges. Annual productivity and maximum "standing" above-surface and below-surface biomass were measured using sequential harvest plots. Decomposition was determined using recently dead B. juncea culms and G. dicarpa fronds confined in mesh litter bags placed on, above, and below the swamp surface.
   The annual productivity of B. juncea (c. 1.4 kg m(-2)) was within worldwide estimates for swamp wetland species, but that of G. dicarpa (c. 0.5 kg m(-2)) was low. The order of decomposition of B. juncea leaf litter was: surface > above surface > below surface; but in the case of G. dicarpa there were no significant differences. Litter bag mesh size did not affect decomposition processes for either species, indicating that larger decomposer animals probably do not have a significant influence on biomass loss. Peat accumulation was estimated based on observations and measurements of the entrainment process. Baumea juncea and G. dicarpa both had high pea accumulation, with 71.6% (0.99 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) and 42.8% (0.22 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) of the annual production remaining, respectively, after all components had been underground for 5 years. Consequently, only a small amount of the annual production of biomass is lost from both sites.

TI EFFECTS OF MECHANICAL DITCH MANAGEMENT ON THE VEGETATION OF DITCH BANKS
   IN DUTCH PEAT AREAS
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SPECIES RICHNESS; GRASSLAND
AB (1) The effects of three aspects of mechanical ditch management (cleaning frequency, cleaning method and dredging) on the ditch bank vegetation in Dutch peat areas were studied.
   (2) The optimum relationship between species-richness and cleaning frequency was examined; species-richness was highest with cleaning once every 2-3 years.
   (3) Thirty-eight species, including many that are endangered in the peat district, did better with cleaning every 2-3 years than with yearly cleaning.  Only five common species had greater cover with yearly cleaning.  There were only small botanical differences between cleaning once every 2-3 years and cleaning less frequently.
   (4) The results suggest that the lower floristic richness with yearly cleaning compared to less frequent cleaning is related to a higher supply of nutrient-rich sludge, smothering of the vegetation and physical damage to the plants.  Acidification of the soil from sludge deposition was not important.
   (5) The somewhat lower species-richness of banks along ditches cleaned less frequently than once every 3 years presumably reflects the effects of succession.
   (6) The cleaning method appeared to have no effect on floristic richness of the banks, probably due to variations in the way the cleaning machinery is used.
   (7) No botanical differences were found between banks examined 1-5 and > 5 years after ditch dredging, presumably because the ditch mud is spread over the fields rather than the banks.
   (8) Cleaning ditches once every 2-3 years is recommended, provided this is compatible with proper water management.  In all management practices, the lowest strip of the bank should be kept free from ditch sludge.

AB A survey of soils and trees was conducted on Syunkunitai coastal sand dune in eastern Hokkaido to clarify the relationships between the soil properties and the plant cover type. A belt transect of 360 m in length was established across the dune. Three community types, that is, a Picea glehnii forest, an Abies sachalinensis forest, and a salt marsh were recognized. Soil types at the study area were determined to be sandy immature soil and peat soil. Their horizon sequences were described as A(0)-V-C or T-V-C layers (A(0), T, V, and C indicate layers of leaf litter, peat, volcanic deposit, and parent material, respectively). The Abies sachalinensis forest was characterized by a relatively high calcium concentration in the surface soil layer and a tendency for podzolization in the volcanic deposit layer. The Picea glehnii forest was characterized by peat accumulation because of the high ground water table, volcanic deposits in the soil profile, and the strong influence of sea salt on the soil chemistry. The roots in the Picea glehnii forest were distributed more shallowly than those in the Abies sachalinensis forest, thus avoiding the high water table level as well as the influence of seawater in the soil. The salt marsh showed an extremely high sodium concentration and base saturation, indicating that this area was directly affected by seawater. Recently, the periphery of the Picea glehnii forest on Syunkunitai sand dune has been declining because of seawater inundation caused by ground subsidence.

AB Microwave-assisted wet torrefaction was adopted in this study for co-processing textile sludge (TS) and biowaste. Key operating parameters, including different temperatures (120-180 degrees C) and reaction times (10-30 min), for the torrefaction of legally recyclable TS (R-0906 in Taiwan) were evaluated. Furthermore, TS was blended with six widely produced types of lignocellulose biowaste at different blending ratios for improving the biochar quality and combustion characteristics. The results indicated that the optimal temperature and reaction time for TS torrefaction were 180 degrees C and 20 min, respectively, beyond which the fixed carbon content and higher heating values (HHVs) of biochar increased from 1.7% to 5.1% and 13.0-18.7 MJ/kg, respectively. However, biochar produced through the torrefaction of TS and macadamia husk with a blending ratio of 30/70 (db%) exhibited the highest fixed carbon content (29.8%) and HHV (19.7 MJ/kg) among the six tested lignocellulose biowaste samples with the atomic H/C and O/C ratios close to those of peat. The thermal stability, activation energy, frequency factor, and ignition and combustion temperatures of the biochar produced through microwave-assisted wet torrefaction co processing were higher than those produced using raw TS or biowaste. The energy return on investment of the biochar system reached 10.9. Greenhouse gas emissions can be decreased by 57.5% if biochar is used as a bituminous coal substitute. Therefore, microwave-assisted wet torrefaction is a sustainable approach for mitigating the disposal problems of TS and lignocellulose biowaste as well as improving the energy performance and environmental friendliness of biochar-to-energy systems. Besides, the protein and carbohydrate contents in the supernatant of TS co-torrefied with biowaste at different blending ratios increased by 1.0-4.1 and 1.2-5.9 times, respectively. These contents can be recycled back to the activated sludge unit as a nutrient source. Overall, the microwave-assisted wet torrefaction process is green and economically beneficial.

AB Carbon emissions from underground coal fires (UCF) have become an emerging research topic and their role in global climate warming has been widely debated. Currently, one big uncertainty for assessing UCF's carbon emission is the hypothesized carbon emission factors (EF) from the complete combustion of coal, while the EF of smoldering combustion of coal in the context of UCF is still unknown yet. In this work, a 1/20 scale laboratory experimental framework was proposed to characterize transient carbon emissions and quantify EFCO2 and EFCO. Effects of fire depth, ventilation area (aperture size), and coal rank on carbon emissions were explored with the extrapolation to the full-scale UCF. Results showed that total carbon emissions increase with the carbon content of coal. Volatile content is an important factor impacting the burning behavior and gas emission. Stable EFCO2 and EFCO of UCF, independent of the fire depth and aperture size, were estimated as 2006 +/- 36 g kg(-1) and 345 +/- 132 g kg(-1), respectively; its combustion efficiency was 85% +/- 3%. The extrapolation of experimental data estimates the CO2 emission of coal fires in China and the USA as 2.34 x 10(7)-4.61 x 10(7) t yr(-1), which accounted for 0.4% - 0.9% of total CO2 emissions in the world in 2016.

AB Question: The role edges play in mediating the effects of disturbance is unclear. Bayhead tree islands, which experience above- and belowground fire, contain trees that recover from disturbance by seed (Pinus elliottii var. densa) and by sprouting (Gordonia lasianthus). How does distance-to-edge affect survival and post-fire response of trees with these contrasting life-history strategies?
   Location: Two bayhead tree islands at Archbold Biological Station, central Florida, North America.
   Methods: Stem diameter, depth of peat smoldering, char height, resprouting status, and location were recorded for all Pinus and Gordonia stems >= 8 cm. Distance to the edge of the tree island was quantified using GIS.
   Results: The focal species showed contrasting patterns of survival across the edge-to-interior gradient that reflected gradients of fire severity. Survival of Gordonia was lowest in the bayhead interior where peat smolder was deepest. Conversely, survival of Pinus was lowest near the edges where char heights were greatest. The distinct types of Gordonia resprouting (crown versus basal) also showed spatially contrasting patterns. Basal resprouting dominated near the edges and was positively influenced by char height, while crown resprouting was nearly constant across the edge-to-interior gradient and was negatively influenced by char height.
   Conclusions: The spatial patterns of tree survival and resprouting observed are likely due to gradients in intensity of peat smoldering and aboveground burning, coupled with differential susceptibility to these two types of fire. Despite the rarity of fire in wetland tree islands (compared to uplands) it may play an important role in structuring the spatial distribution of trees.

AB Sulfur isotopic variations were used to determine the sources of sulfur in a medium-sulfur coal (approximately 2 wt% S) that lacked marine influence, which is often cited as a major source of sulfur in coal. Variations in the amount and isotopic composition of the organic and pyritic sulfur among the coal-bed facies of the Upper Freeport coal bed (Middle Pennsylvanian) are attributed to differential incorporation of syngenetic and epigenetic sulfur. These variations reflect varying environmental conditions during paleopeat formation, porosity and permeability, and the availability of sulfate and iron. A large increase in the abundance and sulfur isotopic value of pyritic sulfur in the upper facies of the coal bed, in proximity to the overlying lacustrine shale, corresponds to an increase in massive and irregular forms of pyrite. This relationship is attributed to at least two stages of epigenetic pyrite incorporation. An early stage of epigenetic pyrite, moderately enriched in S-34, apparently formed during the fluvial-lacustrine period immediately following peat accumulation. A late stage of epigenetic pyrite, highly enriched in S-34, formed after compaction of the original peat as cleat- and fracture-filling pyrite; this sulfur was probably derived from bacterial reduction of dissolved sulfate in groundwater. Isotopic mass-balance calculations indicate that this late-stage epigenetic pyrite may account for up to approximately 50% of the pyritic sulfur in some upper facies of the coal bed. these results suggest that most of the pyritic sulfur in the Upper Freeport coal bed may be epigenetic, incorporated either soon after peat accumulation or later during coalification.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB A high-resolution study (n = 66) was conducted on Late Permian coal measures of the Bowen Basin, Australia, to observe palynofacies changes during peat accumulation over time. Palynofacies were determined using polytopic vector analysis (PVA) to derive end members with variable compositions that reflected fine scale environmental changes, within and between seams, of the Kaloola Member. Palynofacies reflect a three-stage succession within the palaeo- peat-forming environments from stable, anoxic conditions at the base, progressing to variable, oxic conditions toward the top of each seam. In cases where a seam was capped by tuff, rather than siliciclastic sediment, anoxic conditions similar to the bottom of each seam occurred. The results corroborate previous interpretations of palaeofloral communities and provide a new palynofacies model that integrates environmental progression within the coal seams in the Late Permian coal measures of the Bowen Basin. A complementary study of palynological assemblages recognised a shift from Dulhuntyspora sp., to Protohaploxypinus sp. in the lower Kaloola Member, indicating a change in pollen/spore source. Associations between dispersed palynomorphs and coal phyterals of parent flora remain tenuous beyond class rank, due to poor preservation and taxonomic bias inherent within the sample space. This is the first such palynofacies study to be conducted in the Bowen-Sydney-Gunnedah basin complex, thus opening the way for future work examining regional changes in palynofacies, expressed in both coal and siliciclastic sediments.

AB 1 Macrofaunal leaf consumption and degradation of leaves, woody twigs and roots were studied in mangrove island forests on a Belizean island. Factors influencing accumulation of organic matter deposited both above and below ground in this oligotrophic, autochothonous system were assessed.
   2 Leaf degradation rates of Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove) measured in mesh bags, were much faster in the lower than the upper intertidal zone. Mass loss was most rapid in A. germinans but zonal effects were much larger than species differences.
   3 Exposure to invertebrates such as crabs and amphipods tripled overall rates of leaf litter breakdown. In the lower intertidal, crabs completely consumed some unbagged leaves within 23 days. Crabs also had an effect on some upper intertidal sites, where degradation of leaves placed in artificial burrows was 2.4 times faster than when placed on the soil surface.
   4 In contrast to leaves (27 +/- 5% remaining after 230 days), roots and woody twigs were highly refractory (40 +/- 2% and 51 +/- 6% remaining after 584 and 540 days, respectively). Root degradation did not vary by soil depth, zone or species. Twigs of R. mangle and A. germinans degraded faster on the ground than in the canopy, whereas those of L. racemosa were highly resistant to decay regardless of position.
   5 Peat formation at Twin Cays has occurred primarily through deposition and slow turnover of mangrove roots, rather than above-ground tissues that are either less abundant (woody twigs) or more readily removed (leaves).

AB Reclaiming histosols in Monteregie region, Quebec, Canada, increases peat decomposition and compaction rate and decreases the effectiveness of subsurface drainage. The objective of this paper was to use HYDRUS-2D to model the behavior of subsurface drainage systems, in order to evaluate the compaction effect on drain depth and spacing, and to determine the compact layer thickness and saturated hydraulic conductivities (Ksat) resulting in an improvement of subsurface drainage]. The drainage model was calibrated [Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) = 0.958, percent bias (PBIAS) = -0.57%] using Ksat, meteorological data, and matric potential (h) data measured on the project site from June 10 to July 19, 2017. The calibrated and validated model was used to analyze the variation of h values (Delta h in cm d(-1)) as a function of drain spacing (2-7 m) and drain depth (1 and 1.2 m) and to identify the response surface of Delta h to various compact layer thickness and Ksat combinations. The results showed that Delta h was on average 58% greater below the compact layer than above it and that reducing drain spacing or increasing drain depth does not improve the drainage rate. The analysis of the compact layer thickness and Ksat effect on Delta h showed that for a Delta h of 40 cm d(-1), Ksat actual values in the two uppermost layers should be multiplied by 50 for compact layer thickness varying from 12 to 35 cm. Water percolation in the soil is reduced by the compact layer. Soil management methods for improving Ksat should therefore be better than deepening the drains or and reducing the spacing.

AB Negative carbon-isotope excursions have been comprehensively studied in the stratigraphic record but the discussion of causal mechanisms has largely overlooked the potential role of biomass burning. The carbon-isotopic ratios (delta C-13) of vegetation, soil organic matter and peat are significantly lower than atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and thereby provide a source of low C-13 CO2 when combusted. In this study, the potential role of biomass burning to generate negative carbon isotope excursions associated with greenhouse climates is modeled. Results indicate that major peat combustion sustained for 1000 yr increases atmospheric CO2 from 2.5x present atmospheric levels (PAL) to 4.6x PAL, and yields a pronounced negative delta C-13 excursion in the atmosphere (similar to 2.4 parts per thousand), vegetation (similar to 2.4 parts per thousand) and the surface ocean (similar to 1.2 parts per thousand), but not for the deep ocean (similar to 0.9 parts per thousand). Release Of CO2 initiates a short-term warming of the atmosphere (up to 14.4 degrees C, with a duration of 1628 yr), which is consistent with the magnitude and length of an observed Toarcian excursion event. These results indicate that peat combustion is a plausible mechanism for driving negative delta C-13 excursions in the rock record, even during times of elevated rho CO2. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The impact of soil properties on metal bioavailability to plants is well recognized. However, the effect of soil bioavailability parameters on toxicity threshold values for Cu in plants needs quantification. Eighteen European soils varying widely in soil properties were amended with CuCl2 to obtain a range of seven concentrations including an unamended control. Two plant toxicity assays, barley root elongation (4 d) and tomato shoot growth (21 d after emergence), were performed on each soil under controlled environment conditions. The effective concentration of added Cu causing 50% inhibition (EC50) ranged from 36 to 536 mg/kg soil and from 22 to 851 mg/kg soil for barley root elongation and tomato shoot growth, respectively, representing variation in EC50 among soils of 15- and 39-fold. Single regressions carried out between Cu toxicity threshold values and various soil properties showed that exchangeable calcium and soil cation exchange capacity (CEC; measured at soil pH) were the best single predictors for toxicity values from both plant tests. The inclusion of other soil properties, such as iron oxide concentration, soil pH, clay, or organic carbon content, further improved predictions. For risk assessment, we suggest that Cu toxicity threshold values (EC50) be normalized on the key soil property of CEC. If available, soil exchangeable calcium and iron oxide concentration would improve the normalization.

AB The bioavailability of hydrophobic organic chemicals decreases with aging in soil because of sequestration. However, assessments of the risk of exposure to contaminated soils are usually dependent on either chemical concentrations, which are measured using vigorous extraction methods, or models that assume an equilibrium without considering the actual conditions. The objective of this research was to determine the availability and desorption kinetics of freshly added and aged naphthalene from a peat and a mineral soil; naphthalene was desorbed into solutions with pH levels that approximate those found in different gastric regions. Soil and peat samples were spiked with radiolabeled and unlabeled naphthalene at 2 and 20 mu g/g and were aged from 0 to 135 d. Desorption kinetics were determined using a simulated stomach solution (0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M HCl, 0.01 M NH4Ac, pH = 1.0) and a neutral solution (0.2 M NaCl, pH = 6.7) that represented the pH of intestinal conditions and most soils. Feat sorbed much more naphthalene than did soil, and it allowed little desorption. Though both acidic and neutral extracting solutions could desorb naphthalene, little apparent effect of aging was observed in peat, whereas desorption from soil declined markedly with aging. In addition, the percentage of naphthalene that desorbed from soil was greater for the higher incubation concentration. The desorption of naphthalene from the pear and soil was higher into the neutral solution than into the gastric solution. These results suggest that aging, exposure conditions, concentration effect, and organic matter content should be taken into account in predictive models and risk assessments.

AB New lacustrine records from central and southern Wrangel Island are analyzed for their pollen content in an attempt to clarify possible linkages between paleoenvironmental shifts and the dwarfing and/or extinction of the island's mammoth population. A Younger Dryas-aged peat is also examined to provide better understanding of the regional climatic history. Samples of surficial lake sediments from Wrangel Island and Chukotka aid in interpreting the lacustrine records. The modern spectra differentiate the herb-dominated tundra of Wrangel Island from the shrub tundras of the mainland and are unique when compared to other arctic assemblages. Analysis of the fossil data indicates that a herb-dominated tundra has been present on southern and central Wrangel Island since at least 11 ka BP. Comparison to modern palynological data implies little change in vegetation during the Holocene. The lacustrine interpretations contrast to those based on paleobotanical study of peats and alluvium, which suggest modern vegetation was not present until ca 4-3 ka BP. Pre-Holocene assemblages have high percentages of Cyperaceae pollen, perhaps indicating more moderate conditions. Summer climate is inferred to be warmer and moister than present during the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene. The pattern of postglacial warming on Wrangel Island is more like that from eastern Beringia than from other areas of western Beringia. Modern synoptic anomaly maps indicate that such a climatic pattern is reasonable and related to the presence of negative anomalies over western Beringia and a region of weaker positive 500 mb pressure centered over the Beaufort Sea.

AB The paper presents the data on an Eemian-Late Glacial sedimentary sequence from the Zwierzyniec site, central Poland. A number of boreholes document one or two organic layers that occur beneath one or two horizons of clayey and silty deposits of ice-dammed lakes. This study demonstrates to which extent the Zwierzyniec site can contribute to a better understanding of the palaeoenvironmental changes during the Eemian-Vistulian time-frame in central Poland. To study it, a multi-proxy approach was applied, involving: palynological and plant macrofossil analysis, study of rounding of quartz grains and morphology of their surface, and investigations of sand mineralogy and till petrography. The results show that a till bed is overlain by a sandy series corresponding to the glacial-interglacial transition. Either one or two distinct peaks of organic accumulation are evidenced by peat horizons. The lower horizon records spectra with hazel and hornbeam, and did, therefore, accumulate in the Eemian. Observed only in some boreholes, the upper peat horizon marks the Brorup (or the lower part of the Rederstall stadia!) represented by forest-steppe conditions with patchy mosaics of larch and further transition into sedges and herbaceous taxa. Localized in between the two peat sequences, the sandy horizon marks a long-lasting aeolian transformation with weathering by frost in the Early Vistulian. Again, significant changes of the palaeoenvironmental regime occurred, and are manifested in the one or two horizons of the glaciolacustrine sediments. This corresponded to the last glaciation in the region, when the ice-dammed lakes formed during the Main Stadial.

AB Regional tectonic movements during the Neogene period resulted in the development of several fault-controlled basins in Central Anatolia; many of these basins host economic coal deposits. The recently discovered Karapinar-Ayranct coal deposit is the most important one due to its large reserves (c. 1.8 Gt) and location in the vicinity of important urban areas. The paper aims to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental conditions before, during and after coal formation in the eastern part of Karapinar-Ayrand deposit by means of coal-petrography and mineralogical data combined with sedimentological and palaeontological data. The basinal infilling consists of mainly lacustrine, fluvial and alluvial sediments. The coal seams comprise several beds intercalating with claystone, mudstone and marl. The coal being lignite in rank, displays high ash yield (36.4 wt.%, on dry basis) and high total sulphur content (avg. 7.7 wt.%, on dry, ash-free basis). Fades diagrams and lithological features of the coal seams suggest that peat was accumulating under pure telmatic to limnotelmatic conditions; however, peat accumulation ceased several times due to a rise in water level. Therefore, clastic (e.g. quartz, clay minerals) and authigenic (e.g. pyrite) mineral contents are variable along the seam profile. Gastropod and ostracod fauna points to freshwater conditions in the palaeomire. High total sulphur and evaporite mineral (e.g. halite) contents usually point to brackish-saline conditions during peat accumulation; however, in case of the Karapinar-Ayrand deposit, high sulphur contents can be related to sulphate-rich karstic aquifer, which contributed to the palaeomire water supply.

AB Climate change is altering sea level rise rates and precipitation patterns worldwide. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes. System responses to stressors are important for resource managers and environmental stewards to understand in order to best manage them. Thin layer sand or sediment application to drowning and eroding marshes is one approach to build elevation and resilience. The above-and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments were examined at varying inundation regimes between mean sea level and mean high water (0.82 m NAVD88 to 1.49 m NAVD88) in a field experiment at Laws Point, part of the Plum Island Sound Estuary (MA). Significantly lower salinities, pH, sulfides, phosphates, and ammonium were measured in the sand-amended sediments than in the natural sediments. In natural sediments there was a pattern of increasing salinity with increasing elevation while in the sand-amended sediments the trend was reversed, showing decreasing salinity with increasing elevation. Sulfide concentrations generally increased from low to high inundation with highest concentrations at the highest inundation (i. e., at the lowest elevations). High pore water phosphate concentrations were measured at low elevations in the natural sediments, but the sand-amended treatments had mostly low concentrations of phosphate and no consistent pattern with elevation. At the end of the experiment the lowest elevations generally had the highest measures of pore water ammonium. Soil carbon dioxide emissions were greatest in the sandamended mesocosms and at higher elevations. Differences in coarse root and rhizome abundances and volumes among the sediment treatments were detected with CT imaging, but by 20 weeks the natural and sand-amended treatments showed similar total belowground biomass at the intermediate and high elevations. Although differences in pore water nutrient concentrations, pH, salinity, and belowground root and rhizome morphology were detected between the natural and sand-amended sediments, similar belowground productivity and total biomass were measured by the end of the growing season. Since the belowground productivity supports organic matter accumulation and peat buildup in marshes, our results suggest that thin layer sand or sediment application is a viable climate adaptation action to build elevation and coastal resiliency, especially in areas with low natural sediment supplies.

AB Wetlands can store large quantities of carbon (C) and are considered key sites for C sequestration. However, the C sequestration potential of wetlands is spatially and temporally variable, and depends on processes associated with C production, preservation and export. In this study, we assess the soil C sources and processes responsible for C sequestration of riverine wetlands (mangroves, peat swamp forest and marsh) of La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve (LEBR, Mexican south Pacific coast). We analysed soil C and nitrogen (N) concentrations and isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) from cores dated from the last century. We compared a range of mangrove forests in different geomorphological settings (upriver and downriver) and across a gradient from fringe to interior forests. Sources and processes related to C storage differ greatly among riverine wetlands of the Reserve. In the peat swamp forest and marsh, the soil C experienced large changes in the past century, probably due to soil decomposition, changes in plant community composition, and/or changes in C sources. In the mangroves, the dominant process for C accumulation was the burial of in situ production. The C buried in mangroves has changed little in the past 100 years, suggesting that production has been fairly constant and/or that decomposition rates in the soil are slow. Mangrove forests of LEBR, regardless of geomorphological setting, can preserve very uniform soil N and C for a century or more, consistent with efficient C storage.

AB Organic-clastic lake fills, which include lacustrine deltas, are prominent architectural elements in the distal zone of delta plains. We hypothesize that lakes and fossil lake fills affect the development of a fluvial distributary channel. To test this hypothesis, a Holocene palaeogeographic reconstruction is presented of the Angstel-Vecht area, The Netherlands based on a geomorphogenetic map, lithogenetic cross sections, microfossil analyses, and various dating methods (i.e. (14)C-dating, OSL dating, pollen analyses and archaeological evidence). We found that peat accumulation on the Pleistocene substratum started similar to 8000 cal yr BP in response to base-level driven groundwater-level rise. Peat-bounded lakes existed in which gyttja was formed. Fluvial sedimentation in the study area commenced when a new Rhine distributary - the Angstel-Vecht - formed similar to 2970 cal yr BP. As a result, the lakes were filled with fluvially supplied clastic material. Fluvial activity diminished after similar to 2300 cal yr BP although the system continued to function as a high-discharge spillway for Rhine distributaries. This study illustrates the influence of lakes and lake fills on fluvial architecture and sedimentology. Downstream of a take, levee deposits are thin compared to upstream reaches and the channel-belt sediment is clayey. Furthermore, channels maintain a meandering pattern when organic-clastic lake fills form the substrate because of the relative low bank stability. This is in contrast to straight channels in the distal delta plains that are influenced by erosion-resistant peat substrate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID IRELAND; PODZOL
AB Podzolisation, with iron transport and deposition as coloured Bs or Bh horizons, is the fate of acid or decalcified, free-draining mineral soils in Ireland's cool temperate, humid climate. A second generation of iron accumulation, mainly in the form of thin seams (pans, placic horizons) has been studied at several locations in Ireland. These seams generally occur within a former cultivated horizon and within 20-25 cm of the current surface. The time span over which the iron pans developed ranges from a few decades to four or five centuries and invariably involved a change in land-use. The trigger for the new accumulation is a change in Eh/pH relations and/or acid/base conditions. Examples include (1) sudden and massive loading of a parkland pasture with peat debris in the 1950s, (2) acid litter from a single spruce crop (ca. 50 years) in a reclaimed podzol topsoil, (3) slow accumulation of peat debris over a number of decades in a peat fuel storage area, started about 100 years ago, (4) invasion of land abandoned ca. 1850 by heather and other acidophilic species and (5) run down of soil fertility and structure by grazing without amendments (pedogenic age, four to five centuries). The morphological and chemical characteristics of these soils show that where free iron is present in a horizon, any land-use change that establishes a pH or Eh/pH gradient is likely to initiate diffusion gradients and the local accumulation of iron oxides, irrespective of topographic position. This study investigates the effect of organic matter on iron accumulation and on the development of the second-generation eluvial/illuvial horizon sequence as affected by anthropogenic activities.

DE Illinois Basin; coal balls; degassing; fresh-water environment;

AB Large areas of concentrated coal balls (permineralized peat) up to 4 m thick obstructed longwall mining in the Herrin Coal at the Old Ben No. 24 mine. The largest coal-ball area mapped contained >1500 m(3); several areas contained >400 m(3) of coal balls. In-mine mapping established that there were two types of roof (freshwater and marine), and that the coal balls were spatially correlated with the marine roof units. Regional studies and local data revealed that the younger, freshwater Energy Shale (mud) originally covered all of the peat deposited at the mine, but the mud was locally removed during a period of erosion.
   The great majority of coal balls are found within the coal seam, where they were permineralized in situ by carbonates. Some coal balls are found exposed on the eroded coal surface and others are within the channel fill associated with the erosion, which predates any marine sedimentation. Thus, the mineralization of the coal balls was synchronous with the erosion of the Energy Shale mud.
   Data from C- and O-isotope, geochemical, and mineralogical analyses of coal balls and associated materials were used to refine a depositional model of coal-ball formation. The concentrated coal-ball areas were created by the triggered degassing of CO2 from partially decomposed peat in the presence of cations from fresh waters;C-13/C-12 ratios in these coal balls average -23.9%0. C-13/C-12 ratios as low as -34% occurring in the most concentrated coal balls are consistent with CO2 produced by anaerobic oxidation of methane. Top-of-seam coal balls were formed later and show slight to strong marine influence; their 13C/C-12 ratios average - 10.8%.

AB The effect of tree (lodgepole pine) planting with and without intensive drainage on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes was assessed after 45 yr at a raised peatbog in West Flanders Moss, central Scotland. Fluxes of CO2 CH4 and N2O from the soil were monitored over a 2-yr period every 2 to 4 weeks using the static opaque chamber method in a randomised experimental block trial with the following treatments: drained and planted (DP), undrained and planted (uDP), undrained and unplanted (uDuP) and for reference also from an adjoining near-pristine area of bog at East Flanders Moss (n-pris). There was a strong seasonal pattern in both CO2 and CH4 effluxes which were significantly higher in late spring and summer months because of warmer temperatures. Effluxes of N2O were low and no significant differences were observed between the treatments. Annual CH4 emissions increased with the proximity of the water table to the soil surface across treatments in the order: DP < uDP < uDuP < n-pris with mean annual effluxes over the 2-yr monitoring period of 0.15, 0.64, 7.70 and 22.63 gCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. For CO2, effluxes increased in the order uDP < DP < npris < uDuP, with mean annual effluxes of 1.23, 1.66, 1.82 and 2.55 kgCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. CO2 effluxes dominated the total net GHG emission, calculated using the global warming potential (GWP) of the three GHGs for each treatment (76-98 %), and only in the n-pris site was CH4 a substantial contribution (23 %). Based on soil effluxes only, the near pristine (n-pris) peatbog had 43% higher total net GHG emission compared with the DP treatment because of high CH4 effluxes and the DP treatment had 33% higher total net emission compared with the uDP because drainage increased CO2 effluxes. Restoration is likely to increase CH4 emissions, but reduce CO2 effluxes. Our study suggests that if estimates of CO2 uptake by vegetation from similar peatbog sites were included, the total net GHG emission of restored peatbog would still be higher than that of the peatbog with trees.

AB The aim of the present study was to identify the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of peat moss aqueous extract (PME) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. To demonstrate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of PME, the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines were measured using Griess reagent and cytokine ELISA kits, respectively. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis were conducted to evaluate the expression of genes and proteins. Immunofluorescence was used to measure the expression and translocation of transcription factors. Pre-treatment with PME inhibited the production of prostaglandin E-2 and NO by suppressing the gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible NO synthase, respectively. The LPS-stimulated gene expression and the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta were significantly reduced by PME. In the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus, while pre-treatment with PME induced the sequestration of NF-kappa B in the cytosol through the inhibition of I kappa B alpha degradation. In the same manner, PME contributed to the inhibition of the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. In addition, the PME-treated RAW 264.7 cells facilitated the activation of nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2), and in turn, enhanced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. These results indicate that PME exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and suggest that PME may neutralize inflammation and prevent cellular damage by oxidative stress.

AB The extent and function of coastal mangrove ecosystems are likely to be influenced by future changes in sea level. Multiple proxies of past mangrove ecosystems preserved in a 780 cm long peat core (TCC2) taken from Twin Cays, Belize, record palaeoecological changes since similar to 8000 cal. yr BP. The proxies included pollen and the stable-isotope (C, N and O) compositions of mangrove leaf fragments. Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) has been dominant at this site oil Twin Cays for over similar to 8000 years. Variations in delta C-13 and delta N-13 suggest past changes in stand structure between dwarf, transition and tall R. mangle through the Holocene. Marked changes in the delta O-13 (up to similar to 4%,,) of mangrove leaf fragments throughout TCC2 most likely record variations in the proportion of seawater versus precipitation taken up by past mangroves, reflecting the degree of inundation of the site with seawater resulting from changes in the rate of Holocene sea-level rise. Notably, a decline in peat accumulation rate at similar to 7200 cal. yr BP correlates with a decrease in the rate rise in sea level. This was not accompanied by a marked change in the pollen assemblages. However, changes in assemblage composition began to occur similar to 6300 cal. yr BP, with an increase in Myrsine-type and Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) pollen. An increase in the delta O-13 between 6100 and 5300 cal. yr BP, which correlates with other records from Central America, indicates a significant increase in the rate of rise in sea level.

AB The diversity of soils in the southwestern part of the Pacific coast of Russia (Primorie region) is discussed. Overall, 17 soil types belonging to 8 soil orders have been described in this region, and their morphology and properties have been studied. The diversity of plant communities, geomorphic conditions, and parent materials and relatively mild (as compared with other parts of the Far East region of Russia) specify the great variability of soil cover patterns. Low sea terraces are occupied by various peat, organo-accumulative, and gley soils; poorly drained medium-high terraces are the areas of various dark-humus and darkhumus gleyed soils. Typical and gleyic dark-humus podbels, dark-humus, and dark-humus gleyed soils formed on the high sea terraces. Residual elevations are occupied by brown forest (burozemic) soils, including typical burozems, dark-humus burozems, and gleyic dark-humus burozems and by dark-humus podbels. Various alluvial, gleyic gray-humus, and mucky gley soils are developed on riverine plains. On general, darkhumus soils with the high (> 10%) humus content predominate; the area of dark-humus podbels us estimated at about 20%, and the area of dark-humus burozems is about 12%. All the soils in this region are specified by increased acidity values. The exchangeable sodium content is often high in the upper soil horizons with maximum values (0.71-1.19 cmol(c)/kg) in the peat gleyzems, peaty dark-humus soils, mucky-gley soils, and eutrophic peat soils of sea terraces. The grouping of the soils with respect to their physicochemical and agrochemical properties is suggested.

AB The object of this study is to document how the Inuit on the northern coast of Labrador, Canada used terrestrial resources such as peat and wood during the Little Ice Age (LIA; A.D. 15001870). Paleoecological investigations consisting of pollen and macrofossil analyses were undertaken in conjunction with archaeological excavations at the Inuit winter settlement sites of Oakes Bay 1, located in the Nain region of north-central Labrador. Our data indicate that the major changes in terrestrial ecosystems of this coastal region were triggered by climate change. From ca. 5700 to 3000 cal. yr B.P., climatic conditions were relatively warm and moist. At ca. 3000 cal. yr B.P. conditions became significantly drier and colder, which corresponds to broader climatic trends during the Neoglacial period. At ca. 1000 cal. yr B.P., the reappearance of hygrophilic species and the establishment of Larix laricina provide evidence of a return to more humid conditions that in turn triggered the onset of the paludification of sandy terraces in the Dog Island region. Peat accumulation persisted after ca. 580 cal. yr B.P. likely due to the elevation of the frost table during the LIA. Elevated frost tables contributed to water saturation of the surface during the spring, creating conditions that were conducive to the preservation of organic material. Natural resources such as trees and peat were therefore readily available and more abundant during the LIA and extensively used by the Inuit for house construction and heating in the Dog Island region.

AB Both water depth and litter quality are important factors influencing litter decomposition in wetlands, but the interactive role of these factors in regulating mass loss and nutrient dynamics is far from clear. The responses of mass loss and nutrient dynamics to simulated water depths and litter quality are investigated in leaves of Carex brevicuspis and leaves and stems of Miscanthus sacchariflorus from the Dongting Lake, China. Three litter types differing in litter quality were incubated for 210 days at three water depths (0 cm, 5 cm, and 80 cm, relative to the water surface) in a pond near the Dongting Lake. The litter mass remaining, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), organic carbon (organic C), cellulose, and lignin contents were analyzed during the controlled decomposition experiment. Moreover, water properties (temperature, dissolved oxygen content, and conductivity) and fungal biomass were also characterized. Initial N and P contents were highest in C. brevicuspis leaves, intermediate in M. sacchariflorus leaves and lowest in M. sacchariflorus stems, whereas the organic C, cellulose, and lignin contents exhibited an opposite trend. After a 210 days incubation, decomposition rate was highest in M. sacchariflorus leaves (0.0034-0.0090 g g(-1) DW day(-1), in exponential decay model), intermediate in C. brevicuspis leaves (0.0019-0.0041 g g(-1) DW day(-1)), and lowest in M. sacchariflorus stems (0.0005-0.0011 g g(-1)DW day(-1)). Decomposition rate of C. brevicuspis leaves was highest at 5 cm water depth, intermediate at 80 cm, and lowest at 0 cm. Decomposition rate of M. sacchariflorus leaves was higher at 5 cm, and 80 cm than at 0 cm water depths. Water depth had no effect on decomposition of M. sacchariflorus stems. At the end of incubation, N and P mineralization was completely in leaf litters with increasing rates along with increasing water depth, while nutrients were accumulated in M. sacchariflorus stem. Organic C, cellulose, and lignin decayed quickly in both leaf litters compared to the stem litter. The fungal biomass was higher in leaf than in stem litters and changed as a response to water depth in both leaf litters rather than stem ones. These data indicate that submergence has no effect on the decomposition of refractory stem litter and shallower submergence stimulates degradation of the labile leaf litter.

AB Background and Aims Sphagnum-dominated peatlands contain approx. 30 % of the terrestrial carbon pool in the form of partially decomposed plant material (peat), and, as a consequence, Sphagnum is currently a focus of studies on biogeochemistry and control of global climate. Sphagnum species differ in ecologically important traits that scale up to impact ecosystem function, and sequencing of the genome from selected Sphagnum species is currently under-way. As an emerging model system, these resources for Sphagnum will facilitate linking nucleotide variation to plant functional traits, and through those traits to ecosystem processes. A solid phylogenetic framework for Sphagnum is crucial to comparative analyses of species-specific traits, but relationships among major clades within Sphagnum have been recalcitrant to resolution because the genus underwent a rapid radiation. Herein a well-supported hypothesis for phylogenetic relationships among major clades within Sphagnum based on organellar genome sequences (plastid, mitochondrial) is provided.
   Methods We obtained nucleotide sequences (273 753 nucleotides in total) from the two organellar genomes from 38 species (including three outgroups). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using a variety of methods applied to nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The Sphagnum phylogeny was rooted with sequences from the related Sphagnopsida genera, Eosphagnum and Flatbergium.
   Key Results Phylogenetic analyses of the data converge on the following subgeneric relationships: (Rigida (((Subsecunda) (Cuspidata)) ((Sphagnum) (Acutifolia))). All relationships were strongly supported. Species in the two major clades (i.e. Subsecunda + Cuspidata and Sphagnum + Acutifolia), which include > 90 % of all Sphagnum species, differ in ecological niches and these differences correlate with other functional traits that impact biogeochemical cycling. Mitochondrial intron presence/absence are variable among species and genera of the Sphagnopsida. Two new nomenclatural combinations are made, in the genera Eosphagnum and Flatbergium.
   Conclusions Newly resolved relationships now permit phylogenetic analyses of morphological, biochemical and ecological traits among Sphagnum species. The results clarify long-standing disagreements about subgeneric relationships and intrageneric classification.

AB Riverine wetlands are created and transformed by geomorphological processes that determine their vegetation composition, primary production and soil accretion, all of which are likely to influence C stocks. Here, we compared ecosystem C stocks (trees, soil and downed wood) and soil N stocks of different types of riverine wetlands (marsh, peat swamp forest and mangroves) whose distribution spans from an environment dominated by river forces to an estuarine environment dominated by coastal processes. We also estimated soil C sequestration rates of mangroves on the basis of soil C accumulation. We predicted that C stocks in mangroves and peat swamps would be larger than marshes, and that C, N stocks and C sequestration rates would be larger in the upper compared to the lower estuary. Mean C stocks in mangroves and peat swamps (784.5 +/- 73.5 and 722.2 +/- 63.6 MgC ha(-1), respectively) were higher than those of marshes (336.5 +/- 38.3 MgC ha(-1)). Soil C and N stocks of mangroves were highest in the upper estuary and decreased towards the lower estuary. C stock variability within mangroves was much lower in the upper estuary (range 744-912 MgC ha(-1)) compared to the intermediate and lower estuary (range 537-1115 MgC ha(-1)) probably as a result of a highly dynamic coastline. Soil C sequestration values were 1.3 +/- 0.2 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1) and were similar across sites. Estimations of C stocks within large areas need to include spatial variability related to vegetation composition and geomorphological setting to accurately reflect variability within riverine wetlands.

AB The aim of the study was to recognize the vertical variability in the content of different forms of carbon and nitrogen in Histosols of a forest spring niche located in the upper course of the Kamienna Creek (the Slupia River catchment). Soil samples were taken from three profiles and analyzed with standard methods used in the soil science. Analyses included the degree of peat mass decomposition, content of soil organic matter, pH, content of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and forms of carbon and nitrogen after sequential extraction in 0.25 mol KCl dm(-3), 0.25 mol H2SO4 dm(-3) and 2.5 mol H2SO4 dm(-3). The following fractions were isolated: nonhydrolyzable carbon (NHC) and nitrogen (NHN), weakly hydrolyzable carbon (WHC) and nitrogen (WHN), easy hydrolyzable carbon (EHC) and nitrogen (EHN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and its ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) form.
   The Histosols were t up to 0.9 m hick. The degree of peat mass decomposition was 3-9. The content of organic matter ranged from 317.3 to 829.0 g kg(-1), and TOC from 162.2 to 459.5 g kg(-1). The soils were acid at pH(H2O) equal 5.6-6.5. The NHC form predominated in TOC. The content of the form was 117.3-399.7 g kg(-1), and contribution in TOC 72.3-89.2%. Soils contained 17.1-41.7 g kg(-1) of WHC (4.5-10.6% in TOC), and 27.3-62.2 g kg(-1) EHC (6.4-17.2% in TOC). The soils were rich in total nitrogen (TN), whose content was 11.1-33.6 g kg(-1). The content of NHN was 5.50-18.89 g kg(-1) (37.18-69.84% in TN), WHN 4.28-14.17 g kg(-1) (21.23-43.72 in TN), EHN 1.16-8.02 g kg(-1) (8.06-24.32% in TN), and DON ranged from 0.029-0.394 g kg(-1) (0.10-1.20% in TN). The concentration of NH4-N was 0.043-0.337 g kg(-1), and NO3-N 0.003-0.012 g kg(-1). Similar regularities in the vertical distribution of the investigated forms of carbon and nitrogen were observed in every soil profile. In general, an increase in the nonhydrolyzable forms of carbon and nitrogen and a decrease in EHC, EHN, DON and NH4-N were observed with depth. The maximum concentration of EHC, EHN, DON and NH4-N found in bog horizons is probably an effect of the highest intensity of biochemical processes in the topsoil and the influx of fresh litterfall. A constant underground low of water and leaching are the factors which caused a low contribution of labile forms of C and N in lower parts of the soil profiles.

AB Strong ferromagnetic materials at room temperature are of interest for various magnetic applications such as magnetic recording, sensors, and motors. Gigantic magnetism expected for alpha ''-Fe16N2 thin films had been attracted much attention in terms of its large magnetization per weight in comparison to rare earth iron nitrides R2Fe17N3 because these films are made of only iron and nitrogen. It developed much straggling on iron nitride thin film research but inconsistent results were obtained using different preparation methods. A powdered ot alpha ''-Fe16N2-like compound was prepared by the ammonolysis of fine Fe powder in low temperature below 200 degrees C to clarify the confusion; the magnetism was not large in alpha ''-Fe16N2 itself but was increased in the intermediate ammonolysis dual-phase mixture product of the alpha ''-Fe16N2-like compound and residual alpha ''-Fe. A way to control the magnetic coercivity was subsequently investigated to utilize the larger magnetization in the alpha ''-Fe16N2-like compound mixture as magnetic materials similarly to Sm2Fe17N3 bonded magnet. Iron nitrides, zinc blende type alpha ''-FeN and rock-salt type gamma ''-FeN, also decompose at around 500 degrees C. Thermal decomposition was a disadvantage in the preparation of the iron nitrides; however, iron nanoparticles dispersed composites in AIN matrix were derived from the iron nitrides (Fe,Al)N by thermal treatment including laser heating. Iron nitrides are thus promising magnetic materials for their potential applications in science and technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Grasslands cover about 40% of the ice-free global terrestrial surface, but their quantitative importance in global carbon exchange with the atmosphere is still highly uncertain, and thus their potential for carbon sequestration remains speculative. Here, we report on CO2 exchange of an extensively used mountain hay meadow and pasture in the Swiss pre-Alps on high-organic soils (7-45% C by mass) over a 3-year period (18 May 2002-20 September 2005), including the European summer 2003 heat-wave period. During all 3 years, the ecosystem was a net source of CO2 (116-256 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Harvests and grazing cows (mostly via C export in milk) further increased these C losses, which were estimated at 355 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2003 (95% confidence interval 257-454 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Although annual carbon losses varied considerably among years, the CO2 budget during summer 2003 was not very different from the other two summers. However, and much more importantly, the winter that followed the warm summer of 2003 observed a significantly higher carbon loss when there was snow (133 +/- 6 g C m(-2)) than under comparable conditions during the other two winters (73 +/- 5 and 70 +/- 4 g C m(-2), respectively). The continued annual C losses can most likely be attributed to the long-term effects of drainage and peat exploitation that began 119 years ago, with the last significant drainage activities during the Second World War around 1940. The most realistic estimate based on depth profiles of ash content after combustion suggests that there is an 500-910 g C m(-2) yr(-1) loss associated with the decomposition of organic matter. Our results clearly suggest that putting efforts into preserving still existing carbon stocks may be more successful than attempts to increase sequestration rates in such high-organic mountain grassland soils.

ID EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA
AB Peat soils in the Everglades Agricultural area of south Florida are subsiding and releasing nutrients in waterways due to decomposition by aerobic microorganisms. Restoring peat soil in the Everglades involves adding organic matter back to the soil as did the native sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) in predrainage time and removing nutrients from soil water. It is not certain if sawgrass is more efficient at accumulating dry matter (DM) than agricultural crops. This experiment was conducted to compare DM yield distributions and root morphology of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), sawgrass, and St. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze] growing under different water-table depths. Plants were grown outside in 38-L pots containing a Pahokee muck soil (Euic, hyperthermic Lithic Haplosaprist) under 15- and 30-cm water tables. All plants were harvested after 11 mo. Across water-table treatments, sugarcane produced 55 kg m(-2) total DM (above plus below ground), while sawgrass and St. Augustinegrass had similar total DM yields averaging 5 kg m(-1). Sawgrass allocated 34% of its DM below ground averaged across water-table depths compared with 14 and 8% for sugarcane and St. Augustinegrass, respectively. However, sugarcane had 4 and 20 times more below ground DM than sawgrass and St. Augustinegrass, respectively. Sugarcane had 308 km m(-3) of total root length averaged across water-table treatments compared with an average of 24 km m(-1) for sawgrass and St. Augustinegrass, indicating that sugarcane had a much greater potential for absorbing nutrients. Sugarcane appears to have potential for building peat soil in the Everglades while reducing nutrient loading in ground water and allowing for coexistence of agriculture in soil restoration efforts.

TI UTILITY OF COAL SEAMS AS GENETIC STRATIGRAPHIC SEQUENCE BOUNDARIES IN
   NONMARINE BASINS - AN EXAMPLE FROM THE GUNNEDAH BASIN, AUSTRALIA
SO AAPG BULLETIN-AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS
LA English
DT Article
ID GENESIS; NSW
AB Concepts of genetic sequence stratigraphy evolved in marginal marine basin settings where widespread episodic marine flooding events provide readily recognizable correlative surfaces that bound successive progradational clastic wedges. However, application of these concepts to nonmarine aggradational basins has been limited. In cases where marine flooding surfaces are absent, different criteria for sequence recognition are necessary. This paper addresses the utility of regionally extensive coal seams as one type of sequence boundary. Peat accumulation and preservation as coal can only occur in the absence of significant clastic deposition. Formation of coal seams of regional extent requires processes capable of interruption in sediment supply at a basin-wide scale and can define times of major reorganization in basin tectonics or climate. Regionally extensive coals can exhibit the essential attributes of sequence boundaries. In many cases, they are readily recognized and correlated by their unique seam signature, or profile, which is a function of the original peat-forming plants and the physical and chemical conditions imposed during peat swamp evolution. The unique seam profile also records numerous isochronous events, further emphasizing their time equivalance and potential for accurate dating.
   The concept that regionally extensive coals can serve as genetic stratigraphic sequence boundaries is well illustrated by coal seams from the Gunnedah basin, Australia. The Hoskissons Seam marks the initial change to nonmarine conditions in the basin from underlying deltaic and shallow marine depositional systems. The stratigraphically higher Breeza Seam divides the nonmarine sequence into an underlying quartzose, lacustrine, bed load fluvial complex and an overlying volcanic-lithic, mixed load fluvial, alluvial fan complex.

AB Bryophytes are, evolutionarily, between the green algae and flowering plants that lack proper vascular and root systems as well as a protecting cuticle on the gametophyte. Bryophytes are sensitive to environmental stress factors and are widely used as bioindicators. However, bryophytes also show a high physiological flexibility and are able to inhabit ecological niches that range from highly irradiated peat bogs to salt lakes and metal-contaminated sites.
   The moss Pohlia drummondii lives on metal-contaminated habitats in Austria that contain high amounts of copper, iron and zinc. Zinc and copper are essential micronutrients for plants but are harmful if they are applied at high doses. Our experiments showed that P. drummondii prospered in vitro on solid media spiked with 1 mM ZnEDTA and 10 mM ZnEDTA. Using energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX), we detected the uptake and accumulation of zinc from the medium into the gametophyte, but the cellular location of the metal remained unclear. After breaking open the cells in liquid nitrogen, we tried to differentiate between the cell wall and the inside of the vacuole, which were both putative sites for heavy metal sequestration. However, we could not detect a significant difference between the two fractions. The zinc-specific fluorescent dye FluoZin (TM)-3, which was applied to plant cells for the first time, produced more satisfying results. The cell walls of P. drummondii grown on both zinc concentrations showed bright fluorescent labelling, whereas the control cells showed no staining. Plasmolysis of the zinc-treated cells indicated that the dye entered the preplasmolytic space but did not pass the plasma membrane of the leaf cells. From these results, we propose that the cell walls of P. drummondii together with the plasma membrane formed a functional barrier to protect the cytoplasm from harmful doses of zinc, thereby providing an effective mechanism for P. drummondii to tolerate metal contamination and survive on zinc-loaded soils.

AB In the sporadic permafrost zone of northwestern Canada, boreal forest carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes will be altered directly by climate change through changing meteorological forcing and indirectly through changes in landscape functioning associated with thaw-induced collapse-scar bog (` wetland') expansion. However, their combined effect on landscape-scale net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEELAND), resulting from changing gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), remains unknown. Here, we quantify indirect land cover change impacts on NEELAND and direct climate change impacts on modeled temperature-and light-limited NEELAND of a boreal forestwetland landscape. Using nested eddy covariance flux towers, we find both GPP and ER to be larger at the landscape compared to the wetland level. However, annual NEELAND (-20 g C m(-2)) and wetland NEE (-24 g C m(-2)) were similar, suggesting negligible wetland expansion effects on NEELAND. In contrast, we find non-negligible direct climate change impacts when modeling NEELAND using projected air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation. At the end of the 21st century, modeled GPP mainly increases in spring and fall due to reduced temperature limitation, but becomes more frequently light-limited in fall. In a warmer climate, ER increases year-round in the absence of moisture stress resulting in net CO2 uptake increases in the shoulder seasons and decreases during the summer. Annually, landscape net CO2 uptake is projected to decline by 25 +/- 14 g C m(-2) for a moderate and 103 +/- 38 g C m(-2) for a high warming scenario, potentially reversing recently observed positive net CO2 uptake trends across the boreal biome. Thus, even without moisture stress, net CO2 uptake of boreal forest-wetland landscapes may decline, and ultimately, these landscapes may turn into net CO2 sources under continued anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We conclude that NEELAND changes are more likely to be driven by direct climate change rather than by indirect land cover change impacts.

AB In recent years, the use of peat mosses as bioindicators for heavy metal pollution in the atmosphere has been improved. In the present study the suitability of Sphagnum palustre was tested within the Sphagnum-bag-technique as described in guideline VDI 3957 Part 17. For this purpose Sphagnum was exposed at ten locations in Hesse in the immediate vicinity of measurement stations of particulate matter. The results show good and partly even excellent correlations between both assessment methods. Furthermore, characteristic air quality situations could be indicated. A stronger accumulation in the peat moss was shown during the colder months of October to March. Sphagnum palustre has been proved to be a suitable indicator for heavy metal pollution in this study. Different air quality situations with regard to heavy metals can be represented. However, the comparison with the technical measurement method remains limited, because it only represents the concentrations in the atmosphere while the analysis of Sphagnum reflects the effect of heavy metals from total deposition.

AB Eighteen radiocarbon-dated colian and paleosol profiles within a 1500-km-long belt along the and to semi-arid transition zone of north-central China record variations in the extent and strength of the East Asian summer monsoon during the Holocene. Dated paleosols and peat layers represent intervals when the zone was dominated by a mild, moist summer monsoon climate that favored pedogenesis and peat accumulation. Brief intervals of enhanced eolian activity that resulted in the deposition of loess and eolian sand were times when strengthened winter monsoon conditions produced a colder, drier climate. The monsoon variations correlate closely with variations in North Atlantic drift-ice tracers that represent episodic advection of drift ice and cold polar surface water southward and eastward into warmer subpolar water. The correspondence of these records over the full span of Holocene time implies a close relationship between North Atlantic climate and the monsoon climate of central China.

AB The effect of earthworms on the microbial community of composts and vermicomposts was assayed by the following parameters: mineralization activity, the levels of physiologically active and growing microbial biomass, the requirement for growth factors, and the spectrum of assimilation of organic substrates by the microbial community. The substrate affinities of microbial enzyme systems in vermicompost were found to be lower than in compost without earthworms, which is evidence of a higher amount of r-strategists in the microbial community of vermicomposts. Physiologically active biomass of microorganisms is higher in peat-based vermicompost than in compost. The microorganisms of vermicomposts and composts experience deficiency in growth factors to a lesser extent than the microorganisms in soil. The presence of earthworms influences the physiological diversity: the Shannon index increases or decreases depending on the type of composted substrate and incubation time. The growth rate of microorganisms increases on various test substrates in the presence of worms.

AB The long-term development of three humic lake ecosystems in Poland was investigated through palaeoecological analyses of sediment cores. These wetland records spanning the Holocene were analyzed for plant macroremains, degree of peat decomposition, sediment geochemistry along with radiocarbon dating. Morphological characteristics of the catchments and data on contemporary water quality and management approaches were integrated. Our research on the palaeoecology of humic lakes suggests two main states: humic and eutrophic-humic. Of the lakes studied, only one consistently presented features typical of the humic type. The other two showed various states, and dynamic patterns of transformation. The results indicate that these systems can change from humic to eutrophic-humic, and back again, in response to catchment-linked factors, climatic change and human impact. Thus determination of uniform pattern in the development of humic lakes is questionable. This suggests that a reassessment of brown water lakes is necessary.

AB Glacially deformed pieces of wood, organic lake sediments and clasts of reworked peat have been collected in front of Alpine glaciers since AD 1990. The palaeoglaciological interpretation of these organic materials is related to earlier phases of glacier recession surpassing that of today's shrunken glaciers and to tree growth and peat accumulation in the valleys now occupied by the glaciers. Glacial transport of the material is indicated by wood anatomy, incorporated silt, sand and gravel particles, missing bark and deformed tree-rings. A total of 65 samples have been radiocarbon dated so far, and clusters of dates provide evidence of eight phases of glacier recession: 9910-9550, 9010-7980, 7250-6500, 6170-5950, 5290-3870, 3640-3360, 2740-2620 and 1530-1170 calibrated years BP. Allowing for the timelag between climatic fluctuations, glacier response and vegetation colonization, these recession phases may lag behind climatic changes by 100-200 years.

AB This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Neottia ovata (L.) Bluff & Fingerh. (Common Twayblade; Listera ovata (L.) R. Br.) that are relevant to an understanding of its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive characteristics, herbivores, history and conservation.Neottia ovata is one of the commonest orchids in the British Isles. It occupies a wide range of habitats from lowlands to mountains and from wet to dry sites: deciduous broadleaved and mixed woodland, forest edges, calcareous grassland and scrub, hedgerows, dry meadows, pastures, sand dunes, fens, floodplains and some anthropogenic sites.Neottia ovata is a perennial herb whose populations are maintained predominantly by sexual reproduction, as vegetative spread is limited. The main perennating organ is a horizontal rhizome that produces a new internode every year. The numerous adventitious roots are mainly colonized by Basidiomycota from Sebacinales (Clade B) but also by several other fungal groups. Dormancy, that is the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons, has been occasionally observed and typically lasts for one, or sometimes 2years. The species flowers from early May to the beginning of July, or August at higher altitudes. The flowers of the genus Neottia possess a sensitive rostellum that releases a viscid fluid when it is touched, gluing the pollinia to the pollinator. N.ovata is pollinated mainly by three insect groups: ichneumonids, sawflies and beetles. The mean fraction of flowers setting fruit is c.40%, but it depends on weather conditions: in rainy weather, it decreases to 10%, and in warm, dry weather, it can increase to 100%. Spontaneous autogamy is rare (1% of flowers).Neottia ovata is classified as a species of Least Concern in Great Britain. Although it appears well adapted to countryside changes, thanks to its wide habitat range, the species has vanished from almost 30% of its historical sites in Britain and Ireland. Agricultural activities are mainly responsible for losses of N.ovata sites in the lowlands.

AB Following disturbance events vegetation can either be resilient and return to its original state, or there can be shifts in vegetation composition and abundance patterns that may indicate alternative equilibiria. We conducted a long-term field experiment that simulated impact by aerially transported volcanic ejecta (tephra) in a Sphagnum-dominated plant community in order to test the effects of this type of large-scale disturbance. Sixty plots of 1.4 x 1.4 m were established at Sarobetsu mire in northern Hokkaido, Japan and subjected to seven treatments (including the control) with natural tephra or ground glass shards differing in grain size, layer thickness and season of application. Water chemistry and vegetation were surveyed before tephra application and during five and eight years after the perturbation, respectively. Leaching of ions from fine-grained glass shards caused a sustained increase of soil water pH and electric conductivity. Under coarser materials water quality differed little from the control, but a short-lived peak of potassium suggested that mechanisms like nutrient release from decomposing plant material may influence water chemistry after volcanic disturbance. The perturbation initially reduced the cover of the dominant functional group (Sphagnum mosses) in all treatments; vascular plants were less affected. All species were able to recover by growing through the tephra, and open tephra surfaces were colonized by ubiquitous cryptogams, but not by spermatophytes. In contrast to the overall resilient behaviour of the vegetation, in some plots that received natural tephra an alternative state with high cover of the dwarf shrub Myrica gale developed. The patterns indicated that physical and chemical properties of the tephra determined the initial effects on plants, but that stochastic processes contributed to subsequent succession. These are likely to have effects on ecosystem functioning, e.g. hydrological processes and carbon sequestration.

DE oil palm biomass; growth models; carbon stock; plantation components
AB Reliable estimates of the carbon present in stands of oil palm, both in the palms themselves and in other biomass components of oil palm plantations, are crucial for assessing the net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and carbon footprint of palm oil production. Carbon sequestered during the growth of the oil palm crop generally represents the largest item of the oil palm GHG budget, being second in magnitude only to land use change (LUC) or, for crops grown on peat soil, to microbial peat oxidation. In this article, alternative models available for assessing carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in oil palm plantations are examined taking into account factors such as palm age, planting density and soil type. Both linear and non-linear models are discussed and the crop and plantation components contributing to them are reviewed, as is the methodology used, which may involve destructive or non-destructive techniques, or a combination of both. Guidance is given for selecting the most appropriate model.

AB Coal-forming environments require humid to perhumid conditions. Tectonics governs the size, location and availability of coal seams developed in such environments. While large Pennsylvanian paralic basins generated thick and continuous coal seams, many other small coeval basins, which were tectonically active, developed a puzzling succession, with carbonaceous deposits that varied in size, thickness and the nature of the coal-forming flora. This study, conducted in the Penarroya-Belmez-Espiel coalfield, a Variscan strike-slip basin in the south of Spain, provides insights into this subject. The coal seams analysed, generated in different depositional environments, have quantitatively different palynological assemblages. Lacustrine coals are dominated by lycopsids; distal alluvial plain/marginal lacustrine coals are dominated by sphenophytes and tree ferns, and middle alluvial fan coals are dominated by sphenophytes, tree ferns and lycopsids. This means that when conditions were favourable for peat accumulation, peat accumulated regardless of the nature of the available flora.

AB In contrast to the situation in plants inhabiting most of the world's ecosystems, mycorrhizal fungi are usually absent from roots of the only two native vascular plant species of maritime Antarctica, Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis. Instead, a range of ascomycete fungi, termed dark septate endophytes (DSEs), frequently colonise the roots of these plant species. We demonstrate that colonisation of Antarctic vascular plants by DSEs facilitates not only the acquisition of organic nitrogen as early protein breakdown products, but also as non-proteinaceous d-amino acids and their short peptides, accumulated in slowly-decomposing organic matter, such as moss peat. Our findings suggest that, in a warming maritime Antarctic, this symbiosis has a key role in accelerating the replacement of formerly dominant moss communities by vascular plants, and in increasing the rate at which ancient carbon stores laid down as moss peat over centuries or millennia are returned to the atmosphere as CO2.

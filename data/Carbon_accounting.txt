AB Elements of carbon balance of oligotrophic bogs were studied using an example of the landscape profile of the Klyuch River in 1998-2000. Carbon balance was preliminarily calculated taking into account the biological productivity, release of carbon dioxide and methane, and carbon outflow with bog waters. Based on the data obtained on the carbon inflow and outflow, the conclusion was made concerning the progressive peat formation in the region studied.

AB Thermal gradient apparatus has been used to study enzyme activity and carbon cycling in peat collected seasonally from a Northern upland peatland. A thermal optimum was observed in the peat where maximum carbon-cycling enzyme activities (phenol oxidase and beta-glucosidase), phenolic compound concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and microbial respiration (CO(2) efflux) were all found in a given season. The thermal optimum for these carbon-cycling processes coincided with the highest ambient soil temperature recorded at the time of peat collection, suggesting microbial acclimation to the external conditions. Under the waterlogged conditions of this experiment, phenol oxidase activites correlated positively with phenolic compounds (winter 0.96, P < 0.01; spring 0.92, P < 0.001; summer 0.94, P < 0.001; autumn 0.88, P < 0.001) and (beta-glucosidase activities with DOC (winter 0.91, P < 0.01; spring 0.85, P < 0.01; summer 0.92, P < 0.001; autumn 0.72, P < 0.05). We propose, therefore, that the relative activities of these enzymes is crucial in mobilising DOC from the peat matrix, with implications for carbon exports to the receiving waters (magnitude and molecular weight distribution) and CO(2) efflux to the atmosphere. The pronounced seasonality in carbon processing found here, must be taken into account when modelling carbon flux in and from these systems, if responses to climate change are to be predicted satisfactorily. Furthermore, because the optimum activity of these carbon-cycling enzymes shifted with seasonal changes in temperature, it is essential to perform enzyme assays in soil ecological investigations at field temperatures (rather than standardised temperatures), when information on natural process rates is required.

AB Peatlands are a highly effective natural carbon sink. However, the future of the carbon stored in these ecosystems is still uncertain because of the pressure they undergo. An estimation of the peatland carbon balance shows whether the system functions as a carbon sink or a carbon source. La Guette peatland is a temperate Sphagnum-dominated peatland invaded by vascular plants. The studied site was hydrologically disturbed for years by a road crossing its southern part and draining water out of the system. Our aim was to estimate the main carbon fluxes and to calculate the carbon balance at the ecosystem scale. To reach this goal, CO2 and CH4 fluxes, DOC content as well as environmental variables were measured monthly for 2 years on 20 plots distributed across the site to take into account spatial variability. The peatland carbon balance was estimated using empirical models. Results showed that the CO2 fluxes were above 1000 gC m(-2) yr(-1). In 2013 and 2014 the peatland was a net C source to the atmosphere with an emission of 220 +/- 33 gC m(-2) yr(-1). These results provide evidence that restoration should be performed in order to reduce the water losses and favour the Sphagnum-dominance of this peatland.

AB Each year, a peatland has an annual net carbon balance (NCB), which can be positive (net uptake), zero or negative. Over centuries to millennia, this NCB accumulates as a peat profile. Contemporary peatlands can be sampled (cored), and the past apparent carbon accumulation rate (aCAR) can be determined as the quantity of peat carbon in any particular dated interval down the core profile. We use a process-based peatland carbon and water cycle model to compare peatland annual NCB during millennia of peat accumulation to the contemporary estimate of aCAR, resulting from this accumulation. Integrating over the entire profile, the accumulated NCB must equal the aCAR, but for shorter time intervals, these two quantities can diverge. A climate variation/perturbation that leads to persistent, slow carbon loss or negligible carbon gain through enhanced decomposition will necessarily reduce the aCAR for time periods before the climate variation/perturbation occurred. This can compromise peatland climate-carbon balance relationships inferred from joint analysis of peat cores and paleoclimate reconstructions.

AB Peatlands contain approximately 25% of the total soil organic carbon, despite covering only 3% of earth's land surface. The ecological, hydrological and biogeochemical functions of peatlands are tightly coupled to climate. Therefore, both direct human impacts and indirect effects of climate change can threaten the ecological function of peatlands through changes in hydrology. However, little is known about how peatland ecosystems, and specifically their biogeochemistry, carbon cycling, and development, may respond to climatic change. In this study, the Peat Accumulation Model was adapted to investigate the response of peatland development and carbon cycling to climatic change through simulating changes in precipitation and temperature at different stages of peatland development history. The warming and wetting were imposed on this system at 10,000 years since its initialization (mid-development stage) and at 20,000 years since its initialization (late-development stage). Here, it was revealed that peatlands can switch between carbon sinks and sources suddenly, but the extent to which the change takes place depends on the developmental stage of peatland ecosystems. The simulation results for the late-development stage showed that peatlands could function as carbon sources once warming and wetting was imposed but that peatland ecosystems during the mid-development stage can still function as carbon sinks under warming and wetting conditions. Moreover, peatland ecosystems have self-regulation capabilities so that they can go back to their normal ecological and biogeochemical functions under newly stabilized climates. Also, it is the change in temperature that results in the fundamental change in peatland development and carbon cycling. This study indicates that the response of peatland ecosystems to climate change is largely determined by their developmental stages.

AB Dominant plant functional groups (PFGs) found in boreal rich fens include sedges, grasses, horsetails, and cinquefoils (obligate wetland shrubs). Precipitation regime shift and permafrost thaw due to climate change will likely trigger changes in fen plant community structure through shifts in these PFGs, and it is thus crucial to understand how these PFGs will impact carbon cycling and greenhouse gas dynamics to predict and model peatland-climate feedbacks. In this study, we detail the above and belowground effects of these PFGs on aspects of carbon cycling using a mesocosm approach. We hypothesized that PFGs capable of aerating the rhizosphere (sedges, horsetails, and grasses) would oxidize the belowground environment supporting higher redox potentials, a favorable environment for decomposition, and higher CO2:CH4 in pore water and gas efflux measurements than PFGs lacking aerenchyma (cinquefoil, unplanted control). Overall, sedges, horsetail and grasses had an oxidizing effect on rhizosphere pore water chemistry, producing an environment more favorable for methanotrophy during the growing season, as supported by an approximate isotopic enrichment of pore water methane (delta(CH4)-C-13) by 5 parts per thousand, and isotopic depletion in pore water carbon dioxide (delta(CO2)-C-13) by 10 parts per thousand, relative to cinquefoil treatments. Cinquefoil and unplanted control treatments fostered a reducing environment more favorable for methanogenesis. In addition, cinquefoil appeared to slow decomposition in comparison with the other PFGs. These findings, paired with PFG effects on oxidation-reduction potential and CO2 and CH4 production, point to the ability of rich fen plant communities to moderate biogeochemistry, specifically carbon cycling, in response to changing climatic conditions.

ID CARBON ACCUMULATION; LATERAL EXPANSION; MIRES; SINK
AB A region of western Siberia is vulnerable to the predicted climatic change which may induce an important modification to the carbon balance in wetland ecosystems. This study focuses on the evaluation of both the long-term and contemporary trends of peat (carbon) accumulation and its patterns at the southern climatic range of Sphagnum peatlands in western Siberia. Visible and physical features of peat and detailed reconstructions of successional change (or sediment stratigraphies) were analysed at two types of forest -peatland ecotones, which are situated close to each other but differ by topography and composition of their plant communities. Our results suggest that Siberian peatlands exhibit a general trend towards being a carbon sink rather than a source even at or near the southern limit of their distribution. Furthermore, two types of peat accumulation were detected in the study area, namely persistent and intermittent. As opposed to persistent peat accumulation, the intermittent one is characterized by the recurrent degradation of the upper peat layers at the marginal parts of raised bogs. Persistent peat accumulation is the case for the majority of Sphagnum peatlands under current climatic conditions. It might be assumed that more peat will accumulate under the ' increased precipitation' scenarios of global warming, although intermittent peat accumulation could result in the eventual drying that may change peatlands from carbon sinks to carbon sources.

AB Carbon dioxide and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured in a cutover bog of the Jura Mountains (France) together with biotic and abiotic variables for two entire vegetation periods in order to compare the carbon balance of the bog at three stages of regeneration.
   Among all factors, air temperature and vegetation index (including leaf area of vascular plants, bryophyte density and bryophyte desiccation) were the two main determinants of ecosystem respiration and gross photosynthesis at light saturation.
   During 2004 and 2005, the vegetated plots acted as carbon sinks. Net carbon exchange ranged between 67 and 166 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the Eriophorum-dominated plots and between 93 and 183 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the Sphagnum-dominated plots. The bare peat plots represented a net carbon source (between -19 and -32 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Methane fluxes accounted for a very small part of the total carbon efflux (< 2%).
   The recovery of vegetation in our naturally regenerating bog was beneficial for the carbon sequestration after the relatively short period of 20 yr.

AB Inland water bodies are recognised as dynamic sites of carbon processing, and lakes and reservoirs draining peatland soils are particularly important, due to the potential for high carbon inputs combined with long water residence times. A carbon budget is presented here for a water supply reservoir (catchment area - 9 km(2)) draining an area of heavily eroded upland peat in the South Pennines, UK It encompasses a two year dataset and quantifies reservoir dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and aqueous carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)) inputs and outputs. The budget shows the reservoir to be a hotspot of fluvial carbon cycling, as with high levels of POC influx it acts as a net sink of fluvial carbon and has the potential for significant gaseous carbon export. The reservoir alternates between acting as a producer and consumer of DOC (a pattern linked to rainfall and temperature) which provides evidence for transformations between different carbon species. In particular, the budget data accompanied by C-14 (radiocarbon) analyses provide evidence that POC-DOC transformations are a key process, occurring at rates which could represent at least -10% of the fluvial carbon sink. To enable informed catchment management further research is needed to produce carbon cycle models more applicable to these environments, and on the implications of high POC levels for DOC composition.

AB Purpose of Review Understanding of how fire affects the carbon cycle and climate is crucial for climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. As those are often based on Earth system model simulations, we identify recent progress and research needs that can improve the model representation of fire and its impacts.
   Recent Findings New constraints of fire effects on the carbon cycle and climate are provided by the quantification of the carbon ages and effects of vegetation types and traits. For global scale modelling, the low understanding of the human-fire relationship is limiting.
   Summary Recent developments allow improvements in Earth system models with respect to the influences of vegetation on climate, peatland burning and the pyrogenic carbon cycle. Better understanding of human influences is required. Given the impacts of fire on carbon storage and climate, thorough understanding of the effects of fire in the Earth system is crucial to support climate change mitigation and adaptation.

AB Tropical forests make an approximately neutral contribution to the global carbon cycle, with intact and recovering forests taking in as much carbon as is released through deforestation and degradation. In the near future, tropical forests are likely to become a carbon source, owing to continued forest loss and the effect of climate change on the ability of the remaining forests to capture excess atmospheric carbon dioxide. This will make it harder to limit global warming to below 2 degrees C. Encouragingly, recent international agreements commit to halting deforestation and degradation, but a lack of fundamental data for use in monitoring and model design makes policy action difficult.

AB Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a major environmental challenge for the mining industry in northern climates. Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to test various simple and complex carbon sources available in the Yukon as electron donors for sulfate reduction to allow the subsequent removal of Cd and Zn from a Yukon AMD. The 1L capacity bioreactors were monitored biweekly at 5 degrees C. After 162 days, a diminution of both total organic carbon and sulfate concentrations was observed in all bioreactors. A long adaptation period was necessary before consumption of the carbon source started, which might be due to the cold temperature. Simple organic sources of carbon (methanol and ethylene glycol) and complex organic sources of carbon (potato oil, brewery residue, peat, and straw) were used to support SRB growth. Methanol and ethylene glycol led to a diminution of sulfate concentrations of 71.2 and 36.9%, respectively, while the decrease of sulfate concentrations was limited to 13.8 and 5.3% when using peat and straw, respectively.

   MODEL; CO2
AB We summed estimates of the carbon balance of forests, grasslands, arable lands and peatlands to obtain country-specific estimates of the terrestrial carbon balance during the 1990s. Forests and grasslands were a net sink for carbon, whereas croplands were carbon sources in all European countries. Hence, countries dominated by arable lands tended to be losing carbon from their terrestrial ecosystems, whereas forest-dominated countries tended to be sequestering carbon. In some countries, draining and extraction of peatlands caused substantial reductions in the net carbon balance.
   Net terrestrial carbon balances were typically an order of magnitude smaller than the fossil fuel-related carbon emissions. Exceptions to this overall picture were countries where population density and industrialization are small. It is, however, of utmost importance to acknowledge that the typically small net carbon balance represents the small difference between two large but opposing fluxes: uptake by forests and grasslands and losses from arable lands and peatlands. This suggests that relatively small changes in either or both of these large component fluxes could induce large effects on the net total, indicating that mitigation schemes should not be discarded a priori.
   In the absence of carbon-oriented land management, the current net carbon uptake is bound to decline soon. Protecting it will require actions at three levels; a) maintaining the current sink activity of forests, b) altered agricultural management practices to reduce the emissions from arable soils or turn into carbon sinks and c) protecting current large reservoirs (wetlands and old forests), since carbon is lost more rapidly than sequestered.

AB The carbon sink potential of peatlands depends on the balance of carbon uptake by plants and microbial decomposition. The rates of both these processes will increase with warming but it remains unclear which will dominate the global peatland response. Here we examine the global relationship between peatland carbon accumulation rates during the last millennium and planetary-scale climate space. A positive relationship is found between carbon accumulation and cumulative photosynthetically active radiation during the growing season for mid- to high-latitude peatlands in both hemispheres. However, this relationship reverses at lower latitudes, suggesting that carbon accumulation is lower under the warmest climate regimes. Projections under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios indicate that the present-day global sink will increase slightly until around AD 2100 but decline thereafter. Peatlands will remain a carbon sink in the future, but their response to warming switches from a negative to a positive climate feedback (decreased carbon sink with warming) at the end of the twenty-first century.

AB We studied carbon balances and carbon stocks of mountain rangelands and meadows in a network of 8 eddy covariance sites and 14 sites with biomass data in Europe. Net ecosystem exchange of pastures and extensively managed semi-natural rangelands were usually close to zero, while meadows fixed carbon, with the exception of one meadow that was established on a drained peatland. When we accounted for off-site losses and inputs also the carbon budget of meadows approached zero. Soil carbon stocks in these ecosystems were high, comparable to those of forest ecosystems, while carbon stocks in plant biomass were smaller. Since soil carbon stocks of abandoned mountain grasslands are as high as in managed ecosystems, it is likely that the widespread abandonment of mountain rangelands used currently as pastures will not lead to an immediate carbon sink in those ecosystems.

AB Part 1 of this review synthesizes recent research on status and climate vulnerability of freshwater and saltwater wetlands, and their contribution to addressing climate change (carbon cycle, adaptation, resilience). Peatlands and vegetated coastal wetlands are among the most carbon rich sinks on the planet sequestering approximately as much carbon as do global forest ecosystems. Estimates of the consequences of rising temperature on current wetland carbon storage and future carbon sequestration potential are summarized. We also demonstrate the need to prevent drying of wetlands and thawing of permafrost by disturbances and rising temperatures to protect wetland carbon stores and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services. Preventing further wetland loss is found to be important in limiting future emissions to meet climate goals, but is seldom considered. In Part 2, the paper explores the policy and management realm from international to national, subnational and local levels to identify strategies and policies reflecting an integrated understanding of both wetland and climate change science. Specific recommendations are made to capture synergies between wetlands and carbon cycle management, adaptation and resiliency to further enable researchers, policy makers and practitioners to protect wetland carbon and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services.

AB The generally-accepted paradigm of wetland response to dimate change is that water table drawdown and higher temperatures will cause wetlands to switch from a sink to a source of atmospheric carbon. However, it is hard to find a multi-year, ecosystem scale dataset representative of an undisturbed wetland that clearly demonstrates this paradigm on an annual total basis. Here we provide strong empirical confirmation of the above scenario based on six years of continuous eddy-covariance CO2 and CH4 flux measurements in Biebrza Valley, north-eastern Poland. In wet years the mire was a significant sink of atmospheric carbon (down to -270 +/- 70 gC-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) against +21.8 +/- 3.4 gC-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2013) whereas in dry years it constituted a sub- stantial carbon source (releasing up to +130 +/- 70 gC-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) and +2.6 +/- 1.4 gC-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015). Our findings demonstrate that the scenario of positive feedback between wetland carbon release and the present climate change trajectory is realistic and support the need of natural wetland preservation or rewetting. Our findings also indicate that conclusions drawn regarding a wetland's response to changing climate can depend strongly on the chosen period of analysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peat and other organic soils play a major role in the greenhouse gas balance and overall carbon sink function of the Nordic and Baltic forests. A peatland may act both as a source and a sink for all three main greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O. But how much is a matter of debate. An SNS-supported project will add facts to the discussion.

AB The high cation exchange capacity (CEC) of Sphagnum holocellulose may prevent bog peat decay by binding cations necessary for microbial activity. Sphagnum hollocellulose was extracted and added to peat to investigate the effect of increasing CEC on microbial activity. Holocellulose may also act as a carbon source. Thus the effect of different carbon sources was also investigated and holocellulose was added in combination with glucose. PbCl2 was added to peat to release cations bound by cation exchange singly and combined with a carbon source (glucose) or holocellulose. Carbon sources stimulated both CO2 and CH4 production. Sphagnum holocellulose also acted as a carbon source obscuring the effect it may have had through binding cations. PbCl2 increased cations measured in peat confirming that a large pool of essential cations is bound to peat. The cation release stimulated CH4 production when Pb was added alone but not in experiments when Pb was combined to a carbon source. Treatments decreased pH but experiments involving changing the pH showed that increasing the pH, and not decreasing it, stimulated CH4 production. Although there is some evidence that the high CEC of bog peat may have a role in preventing decay by sequestering essential cations; the lack of a carbon substrate is more important. We discuss these findings in relation to increasing N deposition and elevated CO2 concentrations, and the implications for carbon storage by peatlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Undisturbed peatlands represent long-term net sinks of carbon; however, peat extraction converts these systems into large and persistent sources of greenhouse gases. Although rewetting and restoration following peat extraction have taken place over the last several decades, very few studies have investigated the longer term impact of this restoration on peatland carbon balance. We determined the annual carbon balance of a former horticulturally-extracted peatland restored 10 yr prior to the study and compared these values to the carbon balance measured at neighboring unrestored and natural sites. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured using the chamber technique biweekly during the growing season from May to October 2010 and three times over the winter period. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export was measured from remnant ditches in the unrestored and restored sites. During the growing season the restored site had greater uptake of CO2 than the natural site when photon flux density was greater than 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), while the unrestored site remained a source of CO2. Ecosystem respiration was similar between natural and restored sites, which were both significantly lower than the unrestored site. Methane flux remained low at the restored site except from open water pools, created as part of restoration, and remnant ditches. Export of DOC during the growing season was 5.0 and 28.8 gm(-2) from the restored and unrestored sites, respectively. Due to dry conditions during the study year all sites acted as net carbon sources with annual balance of the natural, restored and unrestored sites of 250.7, 148.0 and 546.6 gCm(-2), respectively. Although hydrological conditions and vegetation community at the restored site remained intermediate between natural and unrestored conditions, peatland restoration resulted in a large reduction in annual carbon loss from the system resulting in a carbon balance more similar to a natural peatland.

AB This article reports a dataset on 8 years of monitoring carbon fluxes in a subarctic palsa mire based on micrometeorological eddy covariance measurements. The mire is a complex with wet minerotrophic areas and elevated dry palsa as well as intermediate sub-ecosystems. The measurements document primarily the emission originating from the wet parts of the mire dominated by a rather homogenous cover of Eriophorum angustifolium. The CO2/CH4 flux measurements performed during the years 2001-2008 showed that the areas represented in the measurements were a relatively stable sink of carbon with an average annual rate of uptake amounting to on average -46 g C m(-2) y(-1) including an equally stable loss through CH4 emissions (18-22 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)). This consistent carbon sink combined with substantial CH4 emissions is most likely what is to be expected as the permafrost under palsa mires degrades in response to climate warming.

AB [1] Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes on east European tundra wetland ecosystems (67degrees23'N, 63degrees22'E) were measured by static chamber techniques in 1999. The 29 microsites were divided into wet flarks (WF), intermediate flarks (IF), wet lawns (WL), intermediate lawns (IL), and hummocks (HCK) in accordance to the water table (WT) and vegetation. The seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) varied from -104 mg emission to 249 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) uptake. Regression models were constructed to estimate the seasonal gross photosynthesis and respiration on each of the microsites. The cumulative gross photosynthesis (and respiration) was 68 (37), 131 (77), 176 (126), 164 (129), and 189 (187) g C m(-2) in a 100 day summer period in WF, IF, WL, IL, and HCK, respectively. The losses of carbon in winter accounted for 23.7%, 5.0%, 3.1%, 2.6%, and 2.3% of the net ecosystem production. CH4 emissions in summer (and winter) were 7.7 (7.8), 6.6 (0.8), 8.2 (0.4), 0.7 (0.3), and 0.1 (0.2) g C m(-2) for WF, IF, WL, IL, and HCK, respectively. The modeled annual carbon balance for grouped microsites shows that dry HCKs were carbon sources -7.5 g C yr(-1) while flarks and lawns were carbon sinks ranging from 2.2 to 35.9 g C yr(-1). The results show the importance of WT and vegetation composition on annual flux dynamics in a tundra wetland. CH4 emissions from arctic peatlands seem to be sensitive to changes in the WT.

AB Drainage and conversion of natural peatlands to forestry increases soil CO2 emissions through decomposition of peat and modifies the quantity and quality of litter inputs and therefore the soil carbon balance. In organic soils, CO2 net emissions and removals are reported using carbon emission factors (EF). The choice of specific default Tier 1 EF values from the IPCC 2013 Wetlands supplement depends on land-use categories and climate zones. However, Tier 1 EF for afforested peatlands in the temperate maritime climate zone are based on data from eight sites, mainly located in the hemiboreal zone, and the uncertainty associated with these default values is a concern. In addition, moving from Tier 1 to higher-Tier carbon reporting values is highly desirable when large areas are affected by land-use changes. In this study, we estimated site-specific soil carbon balance for the development of Tier 2 soil CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands. Soil heterotrophic respiration and aboveground tree litterfall were measured during two years at eight afforested peatland sites in Ireland. In addition, fine-root turnover rate and site-specific fine-root biomass were used to quantify belowground litter inputs. We found that drainage of peatlands and planting them with either Sitka spruce or lodgepole pine, resulted in soils being net carbon sources. The soil carbon balance at multi-year sites varied between 63 +/- 92 and 309 +/- 67 g C m(-2) year(-1). Mean CO2-C EF for afforested peatlands was 1.68 +/- 0.33 t CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1). The improved CO2-C EFs presented here for afforested peatlands are proposed as a basis to update national CO2-C emissions from this land-use class in Ireland. Furthermore, new data from these sites will significantly contribute to the development of more reliable IPCC default Tier 1 CO2-C EFs for afforested peatlands in the maritime temperate climate zone.

AB Organic carbon mineralization and storage in the inland water bodies is an important component of global carbon cycling. However, the mechanisms influencing carbon cycling in the inland water bodies remain uncertain. In this study, n-alkane data from a sediment core spanning the last glacial-interglacial cycle from Lake Xingkai in northeast China, were analyzed to determine response of regional carbon cycling to climate change. Prior to MIS 1 the sedimentary n-alkanes were mainly derived from terrigenous higher plants and helophytes in the wetland. By contrast, non-photosynthetic bacteria are probable major alternating source of sedimentary n-alkanes during MIS 1. The n-alkanes in the sediments are mainly influenced by the variations of lake level and deposition of mineral dust. The total organic carbon content (TOC) and TOC-normalized middle- and long-chain n-alkane concentrations increased during glacial times and decreased during interglacial periods, reflecting higher rates of organic matter decomposition under warmer climatic conditions. The temperature dependence of lacustrine organic matter mineralization suggests that the carbon burial potential of lakes in northeast China will decrease in the future as global warming intensifies.

AB Measurements of the spatial variability of methane (CH4) emissions, net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE), and dissolved carbon (CH4, CO2, and DOC) were made in a boreal patterned peatland in northern Sweden in the summers (May to September) of 1992 and 1993. Carbon balance terms were measured and the carbon balance inferred at different peatland surface topography features (e.g. ridges, lawns, and pools) and at different positions within the peatland (e.g. plateau, margin). Combining these data permits a comparison of the carbon balance at the peatland scale for the two field seasons.
   Trends in the spatial variability of the net carbon storage, as determined by the difference between inputs and outputs, suggest that carbon storage decreased in lawns from the margin of the peatland to the central plateau, while the reverse trend occurred in ridges. This indicates a difference in carbon exchange processes between sites with different surface topography due to differences in soil moisture and temperature.
   Total carbon storage for the peatland, weighted for topographic variability, indicates that the peatland gained carbon in 1992 (2.0 g C m(-2)), but lost carbon in 1993 (-7.6 g C m(-2)). There was little variation in mean seasonal air temperature and total precipitation between the two years suggesting that the timing and magnitude of temperature and precipitation variation within the growing season are important for the season carbon balance. Because the carbon storage differences were small relative to the potential errors we conclude that the peatland was neither a net sink nor source of atmospheric carbon. This research demonstrates the importance of position in a peatland for the inference of long-term carbon accumulation and the assessment of contemporary exchange rates.

AB The Late Cretaceous-Early Paleogene is the most recent period in Earth history that experienced sustained global greenhouse warmth on multimillion year timescales. Yet, knowledge of ambient climate conditions and the complex interplay between various forcing mechanisms are still poorly constrained. Here we present a 14.75 million-year-long, high-resolution, orbitally tuned record of paired climate change and carbon-cycling for this enigmatic period (similar to 67-52 Ma), which we compare to an up-to-date compilation of atmospheric pCO(2) records. Our climate and carbon-cycling records, which are the highest resolution stratigraphically complete records to be constructed from a single marine site in the Atlantic Ocean, feature all major transient warming events (termed "hyperthermals") known from this time period. We identify eccentricity as the dominant pacemaker of climate and the carbon cycle throughout the Late Maastrichtian to Early Eocene, through the modulation of precession. On average, changes in the carbon cycle lagged changes in climate by similar to 23,000 years at the long eccentricity (405,000-year) band, and by similar to 3,000-4,500 years at the short eccentricity (100,000-year) band, suggesting that light carbon was released as a positive feedback to warming induced by orbital forcing. Our new record places all known hyperthermals of the Late Maastrichtian-Early Eocene into temporal context with regards to evolving ambient climate of the time. We constrain potential carbon cycle influences of Large Igneous Province volcanism associated with the Deccan Traps and North Atlantic Igneous Province, as well as the sensitivity of climate and the carbon-cycle to the 2.4 million-year-long eccentricity cycle.
   Plain Language Summary The study of globally warm climates and short-lived warming events in Earth's past can provide unrivaled insights into the challenges that mankind may face over the next few generations. Using samples recovered from an ocean drill core in the deep South Atlantic, we have generated continuous temperature and carbon cycle records from the calcite shells of a single microfossil species, spanning a period of globally warm climate from 67 to 52 million years ago, before the development of permanent large-scale polar ice sheets. Our record contains a number of rapid warming events, allowing us to determine their origin. We find that changes in the shape of Earth's orbit around the Sun initiated warming at Earth's surface, which was then amplified by the release of greenhouse gases from temperature-or climate-sensitive carbon stores (e.g., peat, permafrost, or methane hydrates). These rapid warming events increased in frequency and magnitude during the warmer climate intervals characterized by significant volcanic activity, suggesting that such carbon stores become more unstable during warmer climates. As our climate warms at unprecedented rates, the release of greenhouse gases from naturally occurring temperature- or climate-sensitive carbon stores could also form an additional and largely unconstrained contribution to future climate change.

AB Potential changes in both the intensity and frequency of extreme drought events are vital aspects of regional climate change that can alter the distribution and dynamics of water availability and subsequently affect carbon cycles at the ecosystem level. The effects of extreme drought events on the carbon budget of peatland in the Zoige plateau and its response mechanisms were studied using an in-field controlled experimental method. The results indicated that the peatland ecosystem of the Zoige plateau functioned as a carbon sink while under the control (CK) or extreme drought (D) treatment throughout the entire growing season. Maximum fluxes of methane (CH4) emissions and the weakest carbon sink activity from this ecosystem were in the early growth stage, the most powerful carbon sink activity was during the peak growth stage, while the absorption sink activity of carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 was present during the senescence stage. Extreme drought reduced the gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-e) of the peatland ecosystem by 14.5% and 12.6%, respectively (p < 0.05) and the net ability to store carbon was reduced by 11.3%. Overall, the GPP was highly sensitive to extreme drought. Moreover, extreme drought significantly reduced the CH4 fluxes of the ecosystem and even changed the peatland from a CH4 emission source to a CH4 sink. Subsequent to drought treatment, extreme drought was also shown to have a carry-over effect on the carbon budget of this ecosystem. Soil water content and soil temperature were the main driving factors of carbon budget change in the peatland of the Zoige plateau, but with the increase in soil depth, these driving forces were decreased. The findings indicated that frequent extreme drought events in the future might reduce the net carbon sink function of peatland areas, with an especially strong influence on CO2.

AB Peatlands are major carbon sinks globally, but it is still unclear what drives their shift from functioning as carbon sink to a source. Fungi rely on soil carbon inputs and play an active role in carbon mobilization and stabilization. Future climate change scenarios predict increases in temperature and lower water tables, which may lead to functional shifts in fungal communities growing in peatlands. Despite their abundance, the impact of fungi on carbon cycling in peatlands is still poorly understood. Therefore, it is crucial to study the dynamics and distribution of fungal communities in pristine peatlands in order to predict the potential changes in peatland ecosystems more accurately. Here, we review the current knowledge about fungal communities in peatlands, including the influence of peatland type, abiotic factors, and temporal and spatial dynamics on fungal diversity. Our overview shows that fungal diversity in peatlands of certain regions such as tropical areas is severely understudied. Furthermore, we examine the ecological roles and the relative contribution to carbon cycling of functional guilds of fungi in peatlands, showing that saprotrophs are the key guild in organic matter decomposition, and ericoid- and ectomycorrhizal fungi have the ability to act as decomposers and vectors of plant carbon input to soil. We suggest that the application of a combination of methodological approaches for taxonomic and functional characterisation of peatland fungal communities is needed to build better understanding about the diversity-functioning relationships in peatland ecosystems. Overall, this review shows that fungi must be considered as important drivers of mechanistic processes underlying biodiversity, plant nutrient uptake and carbon losses in peatlands.

AB Peatlands are effective carbon sinks as more biomass is produced than decomposed under the prevalent anoxic conditions. Draining peatlands coupled with warming releases stored carbon, and subsequent rewetting may or may not restore the original carbon sink. Yet, patterns of plant production and decomposition in rewetted peatlands and how they compare to drained conditions remain largely unexplored. Here, we measured annual above- and belowground biomass production and decomposition in three different drained and rewetted peatland types: alder forest, percolation fen and coastal fen during an exceptionally dry year. We also used standard plant material to compare decomposition between the sites, regardless of the decomposability of the local plant material. Rewetted sites showed higher root and shoot production in the percolation fen and higher root production in the coastal fen, but similar root and leaf production in the alder forest. Decomposition rates were generally similar in drained and rewetted sites, only in the percolation fen and alder forest did aboveground litter decompose faster in the drained sites. The rewetted percolation fen and the two coastal sites had the highest projected potential for organic matter accumulation. Roots accounted for 23-66% of total biomass production, and belowground biomass, rather than aboveground biomass, was particularly important for organic matter accumulation in the coastal fens. This highlights the significance of roots as main peat-forming element in these graminoid-dominated fen peatlands and their crucial role in carbon cycling, and shows that high biomass production supported the peatlands' function as carbon sink even during a dry year.

AB We critically review recent literature on carbon storage and fluxes within natural and constructed freshwater wetlands, and specifically address concerns of readers working in applied science and engineering. Our purpose is to review and assess the distribution and conversion of carbon in the water environment, particularly within wetland systems. A key aim is to assess if wetlands are carbon sinks or sources. Carbon sequestration and fluxes in natural and constructed wetlands located around the world has been assessed. All facets of carbon (solid and gaseous forms) have been covered. We draw conclusions based on these studies. Findings indicate that wetlands can be both sources and sinks of carbon, depending on their age, operation, and the environmental boundary conditions such as location and climate. Suggestions for further research needs in the area of carbon storage in wetland sediments are outlined to facilitate the understanding of the processes of carbon storage and removal and also the factors that influence them.

AB Northern landscapes accumulate carbon in vegetation and soils while rivers transport significant amounts of land-derived carbon to coastal areas. Here, we quantify carbon sources and sinks in main ecosystems (forests, peatlands, mountains, agricultural areas, lakes) in Norway for 1990-2008, and compare riverine carbon transport with terrestrial carbon accumulation in Norway's four major discharge areas. Mean annual carbon accumulation (6.0 +/- A 0.9 Tg C; 19 g C m(-2)) in terrestrial ecosystems balanced 40 % of national greenhouse gas emissions. The area-normalized terrestrial sink strength declined in the following order (in g C m(-2) year(-1)): tree biomass (40 +/- A 3) > peatlands (19 +/- A 15) > forest soils (9 +/- A 1) a parts per thousand << lakes (2 +/- A 1) > mountains (0.5 +/- A 0.3), while agricultural soils were sources of carbon (-36 +/- A 74). The most precise estimate in the carbon balance was for tree biomass, because of the underlying forest inventory data. Poor data on land management and soil type in agricultural soils, and on (former) drainage and peatland type resulted in high uncertainty in carbon loss and uptake estimates in agricultural soils and peatlands, which impacted the uncertainty in total terrestrial carbon accumulation. Also, carbon losses from disturbance in organic soil types were poorly constrained. Riverine coastal inputs of land-derived organic carbon (OC) were 1.0 +/- A 0.1 Tg C year(-1) (3.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)), with highest area-specific riverine export in western (4.5 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and lowest (1.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)) in subarctic Norway. In west and middle Norway, river OC export was approximately equal to carbon accumulation in soils and wetlands, while it was 50 % of soil and wetland carbon accumulation in southeast and subarctic Norway. Lateral aquatic transport of carbon is not explicitly accounted for in forest soil carbon accumulation estimates, although aquatic fluxes represent a climate-dependent carbon loss from soil carbon pools. The lack of methods that adequately account for lateral fluxes in carbon balances adds considerable uncertainty to soil carbon sink estimates. Climate warming and associated changes in precipitation may result in substantial alterations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes, with uncertain implications for the terrestrial carbon sink of northern landscapes.

ID TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; TRENDS; PEAT; CO2
AB ARCTIC tundra has been a net sink for carbon dioxide during historic and recent geological times1-4, and large amounts of carbon are stored in the soils of northern ecosystems. Many regions of the Arctic are warmer now than they have been in the past5-10, and this warming may cause the soil to change from a carbon dioxide sink to a source by lowering the water table11,12, thereby accelerating the rate of soil decomposition (CO2 source)3,13-15 so that this dominates over photosynthesis (CO2 sink). Here we present data indicating that the tundra on the North Slope of Alaska has indeed become a source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This change coincides with recent warming in the Arctic, whether this is due to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere or to some other cause. Our results suggest that tundra ecosystems may exert a positive feedback on atmospheric carbon dioxide and greenhouse warming.

AB Drainage of peatlands is expected to turn these ecosystems into carbon sources to the atmosphere. We measured carbon dynamics of a drained forested peatland in southern Finland over 4 years, including one with severe drought during growing season. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with the eddy covariance method from a mast above the forest. Soil and forest floor CO2 and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured from the strips and from ditches with closed chambers. Biomass and litter production were sampled, and soil subsidence was measured by repeated levellings of the soil surface. The drained peatland ecosystem was a strong sink of carbon dioxide in all studied years. Soil CO2 balance was estimated by subtracting the carbon sink of the growing tree stand from NEE, and it showed that the soil itself was a carbon sink as well. A drought period in one summer significantly decreased the sink through decreased gross primary production. Drought also decreased ecosystem respiration. The site was a small sink for CH4, even when emissions from ditches were taken into account. Despite the continuous carbon sink, peat surface subsided slightly during the 10-year measurement period, which was probably mainly due to compaction of peat. It is concluded that even 50 years after drainage this peatland site acted as a soil C sink due to relatively small changes in the water table and in plant community structure compared to similar undrained sites, and the significantly increased tree stand growth and litter production. Although the site is currently a soil C sink, simulation studies with process models are needed to test whether such sites could remain C sinks when managed for forestry over several tree-stand rotations.

AB We are investigating the late Holocene rise in CO2 by performing four experiments with the climate-carbon-cycle model CLIMBER2-LPJ. Apart from the deep sea sediments, important carbon cycle processes considered are carbon uptake or release by the vegetation, carbon uptake by peatlands, and CO2 release due to shallow water sedimentation of CaCO3. Ice core data of atmospheric CO2 between 8 ka BP and preindustrial climate can only be reproduced if CO2 outgassing due to shallow water sedimentation of CaCO3 is considered. In this case the model displays an increase of nearly 20 ppmv CO2 between 8 ka BP and present day. Model configurations that do not contain this forcing show a slight decrease in atmospheric CO2. We can therefore explain the late Holocene rise in CO2 by invoking natural forcing factors only, and anthropogenic forcing is not required to understand preindustrial CO2 dynamics.

AB Vegetation degradation resulting from climate change and human activities in wet meadows is an important issue worldwide. This phenomenon is known to influence soil labile organic carbon (LOC) and enzyme activities due to changes in environmental conditions. However, little is known about the response of LOC and enzyme activities to vegetation degradation in high-altitude wet meadows. In this study, we examined the response of LOC and carbon-cycle enzyme activities to different intensities of vegetation degradation (i.e., non-degraded (ND), slightly degraded (SD) moderately degraded (MD), and heavily degraded (HD)) in a Tibetan wet meadow. The contents of soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) and the carbon-cycle enzyme activities (i.e., cellulase, amylase and beta-glucosidase) were investigated in two growing seasons (2016 and 2017). We found that the content of soil SOC and LOC fractions declined with increasing soil depth in each degraded level except for HD. Vegetation degradation significantly decreased the amount of SOC at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm, and this decrease was attributed to the relative reduction of carbon source input and higher carbon decomposition. Vegetation degradation also significantly reduced the contents of SWC, DOC, MBC, LFOC, amylase and beta-glucosidase in the topsoil layers (0-10 and 10-20 cm). However, the corresponding contents in deeper soil layers had no significant differences. In addition, the SWC, DOC, LFOC and the carbon-cycle enzyme activities were higher in 2016 than in 2017. Significant correlations were obtained between SWC, SOC, LOC fractions and enzyme activities. Soil moisture was found to be the main abiotic driver for variation of soil carbon and enzyme activities. Our results indicate that vegetation degradation in the Tibetan wet meadows decreased the quantity of topsoil labile carbon fractions and enzyme activities and heavily degraded vegetation may lead to a change of profile distribution in soil carbon pool.

AB We examine the carbon balance of North American wetlands by reviewing and synthesizing the published literature and soil databases. North American wetlands contain about 220 Pg C, most of which is in peat. They are a small to moderate carbon sink of about 49 Tg C yr(-1), although the uncertainty around this estimate is greater than 100%, with the largest unknown being the role of carbon sequestration by sedimentation in freshwater mineral-soil wetlands. We estimate that North American wetlands emit 9 Tg methane (CH4) yr(-1); however, the uncertainty of this estimate is also greater than 100%. With the exception of estuarine wetlands, CH4 emissions from wetlands may largely offset any positive benefits of carbon sequestration in soils and plants in terms of climate forcing. Historically, the destruction of wetlands through land-use changes has had the largest effects on the carbon fluxes and consequent radiative forcing of North American wetlands. The primary effects have been a reduction in their ability to sequester carbon (a small to moderate increase in radiative forcing), oxidation of their soil carbon reserves upon drainage (a small increase in radiative forcing), and reduction in CH4 emissions (a small to large decrease in radiative forcing). It is uncertain how global changes will affect the carbon pools and fluxes of North American wetlands. We will not be able to predict accurately the role of wetlands as potential positive or negative feedbacks to anthropogenic global change without knowing the integrative effects of changes in temperature, precipitation, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur on the carbon balance of North American wetlands.

AB The global drive to produce low-carbon energy has resulted in an unprecedented deployment of onshore wind turbines, representing a significant land use change for wind energy generation with uncertain consequences for local climatic conditions and the regulation of ecosystem processes. Here, we present high-resolution data from a wind farm collected during operational and idle periods that shows the wind farm affected several measures of ground-level climate. Specifically, we discovered that operational wind turbines raised air temperature by 0.18 degrees C and absolute humidity (AH) by 0.03 gm(-3) during the night, and increased the variability in air, surface and soil temperature throughout the diurnal cycle. Further, the microclimatic influence of turbines on air temperature and AH decreased logarithmically with distance from the nearest turbine. These effects on ground-level microclimate, including soil temperature, have uncertain implications for biogeochemical processes and ecosystem carbon cycling, including soil carbon stocks. Consequently, understanding needs to be improved to determine the overall carbon balance of wind energy.

AB Tropical papyrus wetlands have the ability to assimilate and sequester significant amounts of carbon. However, the spatial extent, productivity and carbon sink strength associated with papyrus wetlands remains poorly characterised. The objective of this study was to collate information from peer-reviewed publications and relevant government and NGO reports to better understand carbon dynamics within papyrus dominated wetlands, and to assess the processes that regulate the magnitude of the carbon sink. Papyrus wetlands were shown to exhibit high rates of photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation of up to 40 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) where the incident photosynthetic photon flux density was a parts per thousand yen1,000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), high rates of net primary production ranging between 14 and 52 g DM m(-2) d(-1) and represent a significant carbon sink where up to 88 t C ha(-1) is stored in the aboveground and belowground components of the papyrus vegetation. Under flooded conditions significant detrital and peat deposits accumulate in excess of 1 m in depth, representing an additional carbon store in the order of 640 t C ha(-1). This study also highlighted the lack of empirical data on emissions of other radiatively important trace gases such as methane and nitrous oxide and also the vulnerability of these carbon sinks to both future changes in climate, in particular periods of hydrological drawdown, and anthropogenic land use change where the papyrus vegetation is removed in favour of subsistence agricultural cropping systems.

AB The dynamic carbon balance of a southeastern New Hampshire wetland was constructed for the 1994 growing season using a light-dark box sampling method. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (n=414) and ecosystem respiration (n=234) measurements were made at the 1.7 ha Sphagnum spp. dominated poor fen. The NEE rates ranged from -192 to 492 mg C m(-2) h(-1) and the ecosystem respiration measurements were between -10 and -365 mg C m(-2) h(-1). The negative values represent a loss of carbon from the wetland system. NEE and respiration data were used to derive photosynthesis rates of the vegetation at the study site. A simple model, using hourly averages of photosynthetically active radiation, and air and soil temperatures to generate hourly rates of photosynthesis and respiration, was constructed to interpolate the carbon cycling rates at this fen through the entire 1994 growing season. Results of the carbon balance model suggest that the wetland lost an estimated 145 g C m(-2) for the 9 month modeling period (April through December). The 1994 climate season was warmer (+1.15 degrees C/month) and drier (-12.3 cm) than the 30 year normals for Durham, New Hampshire, the nearest meteorological station. These data suggest that if future climate change brings about warmer temperatures and lower water tables in peatland soils, positive climatic feedback leading to substantial releases of CO2 from boreal and subarctic peatlands is probable.

AB The sustainability argument that more peat grows in Finland than is used does not hold. On designated peatlands, growth is about 85 times slower than peat use; growth elsewhere in Finland does not add to available resources. Claiming undisturbed peatlands as carbon sinks for sustainable peat use is also misleading as anthropogenic carbon sources require additional sinks, not natural ones. Undisturbed peatlands usually emit significant quantities of methane. About 57 000 km(2) of forestry drained peatlands now have effectively stopped emitting methane, and temporarily accumulate more carbon annually than earlier. These greenhouse reducing aspects are only modestly compensated or 'used' by emissions from peat used for energy. However, as forests mature and the peat underneath continues to oxidise, the new carbon sink will eventually turn into a carbon source. Multiple claims of this very same anthropogenic carbon sink (perhaps by the peat, paper and timber industry), i.e. double counting, may be avoided by certifying these sinks. After peat harvesting (liberating in the order of 375 kg atmospheric carbon per m(2)), wood in a production/harvest cycle may be grown (at 0.1 kgC/m(2) per a) on the now available area, as a renewable energy source. These numbers indicate the slow rate at which these cycles, that are in principle carbon neutral in themselves, help compensate for the carbon emissions from the earlier use of peat by avoiding the emissions of fossil fuels otherwise used.

TI Permafrost collapse shifts alpine tundra to a carbon source but reduces

AB Important unknowns remain about how abrupt permafrost collapse (thermokarst) affects carbon balance and greenhouse gas flux, limiting our ability to predict the magnitude and timing of the permafrost carbon feedback. We measured monthly, growing-season fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O at a large thermokarst feature in alpine tundra on the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Thermokarst formation disrupted plant growth and soil hydrology, shifting the ecosystem from a growing-season carbon sink to a weak source but decreasing feature level CH4 and N2O flux. Temperature-corrected ecosystem respiration from decomposing permafrost soil was 2.7 to 9.5-fold higher than in similar features from Arctic and Boreal regions, suggesting that warmer and dryer conditions on the northern QTP could accelerate carbon decomposition following permafrost collapse. N2O flux was similar to the highest values reported for Arctic ecosystems and was 60% higher from exposed mineral soil on the feature floor, confirming Arctic observations of coupled nitrification and denitrification in collapsed soils. Q(10) values for respiration were typically over 4, suggesting high-temperature sensitivity of thawed carbon. Taken together, these results suggest that QTP permafrost carbon in alpine tundra is highly vulnerable to mineralization following thaw, and that N2O production could be an important noncarbon permafrost climate feedback. Permafrost collapse altered soil hydrology, shifting the ecosystem from a carbon sink to carbon source but decreasing CH4 and N2O flux. Little to no vegetation recovery after stabilization suggests potentially large net carbon losses. High N2O flux compared to Arctic and Boreal systems suggests noncarbon permafrost climate feedback.

AB Climate warming raises the question whether high-latitude landscape still function as net carbon (C) sinks. By compiling an integrated C balance for an intensely studied subarctic catchment, we show that this catchment's C balance is not likely to be a strong current sink of C, a commonly held assumption. In fact, it is more plausible (71% probability) that the studied catchment functions as a C source (-1120gCm(-2)yr(-1)). Analyses of individual fluxes indicate that soil and aquatic C losses offset C sequestering in other landscape components (e.g., peatlands and aboveground forest biomass). Our results stress the importance of fully integrated catchment C balance estimates and highlight the importance of upland soils and their interaction with the aquatic network for the catchment C balance.

AB The Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT), 34Ma, marks a tipping point in the long-term Cenozoic greenhouse to icehouse climate transition. Paleorecords reveal stepwise rapid cooling and ice growth across the EOT tightly coupled to a transient benthic C-13 excursion and a major and permanent deepening of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD). Based on biogeochemical box modeling, Merico et al. (2008) suggested that a combination of (1) glacioeustatic sea level fall-induced shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation and (2) shelf carbonate weathering can account for the carbon cycle perturbation, but this finding has been questioned. Alternative proposed mechanisms include increased ocean ventilation, decreased carbonate burial, increased organic carbon burial, increased silicate weathering, and increased ocean calcium concentration. Here we use an improved version of the biogeochemical box model of Merico et al. (2008) to reevaluate these competing hypotheses and an additional mechanism, the expansion of carbon capacitors such as permafrost and peatlands. We find that changes in calcium concentration, silicate weathering, and carbonate or organic carbon burial each yield a response that is fundamentally at odds with the form and/or sign of the paleorecords. Shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation (CCD change), plus shelf carbonate weathering, sequestration of C-12-enriched carbon into carbon capacitors, and possibly increased ocean ventilation (C-13 excursion), offers the best fit to the paleorecords. Further work is needed to understand why the EOT carbon cycle perturbation is so unique when the forcing mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible (cooling and ice growth) are not peculiar to this event.

AB Trends in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 during three recent interglacials - the Holocene, the Eemian and Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 - are investigated using an earth system model of intermediate complexity, which we extended with process-based modules to consider two slow carbon cycle processes - peat accumulation and shallow-water CaCO3 sedimentation (coral reef formation). For all three interglacials, model simulations considering peat accumulation and shallow-water CaCO3 sedimentation substantially improve the agreement between model results and ice core CO2 reconstructions in comparison to a carbon cycle set-up neglecting these processes. This enables us to model the trends in atmospheric CO2, with modelled trends similar to the ice core data, forcing the model only with orbital and sea level changes. During the Holocene, anthropogenic CO2 emissions are required to match the observed rise in atmospheric CO2 after 3 ka BP but are not relevant before this time. Our model experiments show a considerable improvement in the modelled CO2 trends by the inclusion of the slow carbon cycle processes, allowing us to explain the CO2 evolution during the Holocene and two recent interglacials consistently using an identical model set-up.

AB Understanding the transition of biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange between glacial and interglacial climates can constrain uncertainties in its future projections. Using an individual-based dynamic vegetation model, we simulate vegetation distribution and terrestrial carbon cycling in past cold and warm climates and elucidate the forcing effects of temperature, precipitation, atmospheric CO2 concentration (pCO(2)), and landmass. Results are consistent with proxy reconstructions and reveal that the vegetation extent is mainly determined by temperature anomalies, especially in a cold climate, while precipitation forcing effects on global-scale vegetation patterns are marginal. The pCO(2) change controls the global carbon balance with the fertilization effect of higher pCO(2) linking to higher vegetation coverage, an enhanced terrestrial carbon sink, and increased terrestrial carbon storage. Our results indicate carbon transfer from ocean and permafrost/peat to the biosphere and atmosphere and highlight the importance of forest expansion as a driver of terrestrial ecosystem carbon stock from cold to warm climates.

AB The ability to forecast ecological carbon cycling is imperative to land management in a world where past carbon fluxes are no longer a clear guide in the Anthropocene. However, carbon-flux forecasting has not been practiced routinely like numerical weather prediction. This study explored (1) the relative contributions of model forcing data and parameters to uncertainty in forecasting flux- versus pool-based carbon cycle variables and (2) the time points when temperature and CO2 treatments may cause statistically detectable differences in those variables. We developed an online forecasting workflow (Ecological Platform for Assimilation of Data (EcoPAD)), which facilitates iterative data-model integration. EcoPAD automates data transfer from sensor networks, data assimilation, and ecological forecasting. We used the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Experiments data collected from 2011 to 2014 to constrain the parameters in the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, forecast carbon cycle responses to elevated CO2 and a gradient of warming from 2015 to 2024, and specify uncertainties in the model output. Our results showed that data assimilation substantially reduces forecasting uncertainties. Interestingly, we found that the stochasticity of future external forcing contributed more to the uncertainty of forecasting future dynamics of C flux-related variables than model parameters. However, the parameter uncertainty primarily contributes to the uncertainty in forecasting C pool-related response variables. Given the uncertainties in forecasting carbon fluxes and pools, our analysis showed that statistically different responses of fast-turnover pools to various CO2 and warming treatments were observed sooner than slow-turnover pools. Our study has identified the sources of uncertainties in model prediction and thus leads to improve ecological carbon cycling forecasts in the future.

AB This work aimed to rely expression of the fengycin promoter to fengycin production under different culture conditions. To this end, Bacillus subtilis BBG208, derived from BBG21, which is a fengycin overproducing strain carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of fengycin promoter, was used to assess the effects of different carbon and nitrogen sources on surfactin and fengycin production and the fengycin promoter expression. The data showed that some carbon sources oriented synthesis of one family of lipopeptides, while most of the nitrogen sources allowed high co-production of fengycin and surfactin. High expressions of promoter P-fen and fengycin synthesis were obtained with urea or urea + ammonium mixture as nitrogen source and mannitol as carbon source. Moreover, temperature, pH and oxygenation influenced their biosynthesis based on the nutrition conditions. Optimization of the production medium increased the fengycin production to 768 mg L-1, which is the highest level reported for this strain. This study defines the suitable nutrient conditions allowing as well the highest expression of the fengycin promoter and portrays the conditions relying on the fengycin and surfactin production.

AB Prediction of the effect of harvests and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of forests is necessary both for CC mitigation and adaptation purposes.
   We assessed the impact of roundwood and fuelwood removals and climate change (CC) on the changes in carbon stock of Finnish forests during 2007-2042. We considered three harvest scenarios: two based on the recent projections of roundwood and fuelwood demand, and the third reflecting the maximum sustainable cutting level. We applied two climate scenarios: the climate was in the state that prevailed around year 2006, or it changed according to the IPCC SRES A1B scenario.
   We combined the large-scale forestry model MELA with the soil carbon model Yasso07 for mineral soils. For soils of drained, forested peatlands, we used a method based on emission factors.
   The stock change of trees accounted for approximately 80 % of the total stock change. Trees and mineral soils acted as carbon sinks and the drained peatland soils as a carbon source. The forest carbon sink increased clearly in both of the demand-based scenarios, reaching the level of 13-20 Tg C/year (without CC). The planned increase in the use of bioenergy reduced the forest sink by 2.6 Tg C/year. CC increased the forest carbon sink in 2042 by 38 %-58 % depending on the scenario. CC decreased the sink of mineral soils in the initial years of the simulations; after 2030, the effect was slightly positive. CC increased the emissions from the drained peatland soils.
   It is likely that forest land in Finland acts as a carbon sink in the future. The changes in carbon stocks of trees, mineral soils, and peatland soils respond differently to CC and fuelwood and roundwood harvests.

AB Globally, peatlands store a large quantity of soil carbon that can be subsequently modified by hydrologic alterations from land-use change and climate change. However, there are many uncertainties in predicting how carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions are altered by long-term changes in hydrology. Therefore, the goal of this study was to quantify how multi-decadal manipulations of water table (WT) levels affected carbon cycling (plant production and net ecosystem exchange from three eddy covariance towers) in a peatland complex modified by levee construction, which created a wetter area up-gradient of the levee (mean WT was 12.1 cm below the surface), a dry area below the levee (36.8 cm), and an adjacent reference site not affected by the levee (21.6 cm). We found that mean total plant production was greatest in the reference site (311.9 g C m(-2) y(-1)), followed by the dry site (290.5 g C m(-2) y(-1)), and lowest in the wet site (227.1 g C m(-2) y(-1)). Net ecosystem exchange during the growing season was negative for all sites (sink), with the wet site having the greatest sink and the dry site having the lowest sink. Ecosystem respiration increased and CH4 emissions decreased with a decreasing WT level. This research demonstrates that human alteration of peatland WT levels can have long-term (> 50 years) consequences on peatland carbon cycling.

AB On a global scale, over the past 200 years peatlands have become a source rather than a sink of carbon. Drainage for agriculture, forestry and peat extraction have resulted in a 16-37 per cent loss in the carbon sink capacity. The current scenarios for climate change in Britain will exacerbate this loss. A shift in the carbon balance of peatlands is not necessarily the only outcome of climate change. Indirect hydrological changes-especially alteration of the position of the peat water table-will affect the stability of peatland ecosystems. This raises a number of questions concerning the future of British peatlands: the most important of which is how will the water balance change on a regional scale? In Britain the potential response of peatlands to climate change varies spatially. In upland areas, where rainfall is the main source of water, the key question is will erosion increase and if so, how fast? It will also be important to establish the drainage network response in terms of run-off, sediment loading and stream water quality. Increased precipitation may increase the rate of sedimentation in reservoirs thus affecting their water-holding capacity and water quality. Enhanced decomposition at elevated temperatures may also increase the microbial release of humic acids and increase the incidence of colour in upland waters which will in turn increase the cost of water quality treatment. In lowland Britain, the increased flood risk and more or less permanently elevated water table (as a result of both a rising sea level and sinking land surface) may enable peat regeneration through paludification. Key areas that are likely to be affected have spring or floodwater as their main source of water. They include the Norfolk Broads, Suffolk valley peats, Cambridgeshire Fens, Humberhead Levels, Derwent Ings and possibly the Somerset and Gwent Levels. In order to minimize the effects of climate change on peatlands and to preserve their existing carbon sink capacity (however small) they must remain hydrologically intact, and as high a water table as possible must be maintained. This may be possible in low-lying areas if flooding reinstates paludification but the process of peat regeneration is a slow one. In upland areas the effect of climate change is less clear; increased precipitation may encourage peat formation but it may also result in greater erosion.

AB Sequestration of organic matter by peat accumulation constitutes a primary sink for carbon in the global carbon cycle. The processes that control the formation and storage of peat at geological time scales are poorly understood but are of a non-solved issue of fundamental importance for understanding the global climate system. We analyzed a 7 million years long terrestrial record of Late Oligocene age from the As Pontes Basin in Northern Spain, which demonstrates that minima in the 405-kyr and 2.4-Myr eccentricity cycles play a key role in peat formation. Such nodes exhibit reduced precession amplitudes, thus avoiding extremes in seasons and seasonal contrast for a prolonged period of time. In the As Pontes Basin, this orbital configuration is associated with a decrease in siliciclastic sedimentation and enhanced peat formation. Feedbacks between equilibrium landscapes and ecosystem stability will lead to a deceleration of weathering and erosion rates in catchment areas and to minimum and stable sediment flux along the sediment routing system. Mid-latitude peat burial could contribute to disturb the carbon cycle by removing (atmospheric) carbon at times of minimum eccentricity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are important carbon reserves in terrestrial ecosystems. The microtopography of a peatland area has a strong influence on its carbon balance, determining carbon fluxes at a range of spatial scales. These patterned surfaces are very sensitive to changing climatic conditions. There are open research questions concerning the stability, behaviour and transformation of these microstructures, and the implications of these changes for the long-term accumulation of organic matter in peatlands. A simple two-dimensional peat microtopographical model was developed, which accounts for the effects of microtopographical variations and a dynamic water table on competitive interactions between peat-forming plants. In a case study of a subarctic mire in northern Sweden, we examined the consequences of such interactions on peat accumulation patterns and the transformation of microtopographical structure. The simulations demonstrate plausible interactions between peatland growth, water table position and microtopography, consistent with many observational studies, including an observed peat age profile from the study area. Our model also suggests that peatlands could exhibit alternative compositional and structural dynamics depending on the initial topographical and climatic conditions, and plant characteristics. Our model approach represents a step towards improved representation of peatland vegetation dynamics and net carbon balance in Earth system models, allowing their potentially important implications for regional and global carbon balances and biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks to the atmosphere to be explored and quantified.

AB Peatland soils represent globally significant stores of carbon, and understanding carbon cycling pathways in these ecosystems has important implications for global climate change. We measured aceticlastic and autotrophic methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, denitrification, and iron reduction in a bog, an intermediate fen, and a rich fen in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for one growing season. In 3-d anaerobic incubations of slurried peat, denitrification and iron reduction were minor components of anaerobic carbon mineralization. Experiments using C-14-labeled methanogenic substrates showed that methanogenesis in these peatlands was primarily through the aceticlastic pathway, except early in the growing season in more ombrotrophic peatlands, where the autotrophic pathway was dominant or codominant. Overall, methane production was responsible for 3-70% of anaerobic carbon mineralization. Sulfate reduction accounted for 0-26% of anaerobic carbon mineralization, suggesting a rapid turnover of a very small sulfate pool. A large percentage of anaerobic carbon mineralization (from 29% to 85%) was unexplained by any measured process, which could have resulted from fermentation or possibly from the use of organic molecules (e.g., humic acids) as alternative electron acceptors.

Ecosystems are often represented by static "storage-flow" diagrams reflecting their structure and matter or energy transfer between components at fixed time moments. Using the data of such diagrams aggregated in ecological field studies one can construct a dynamic model of the ecosystem to predict its future behaviour and to estimate a response to external perturbations-natural and human. Stability of both current equilibrium and possible alternative steady states and more complicated attractors are studied under two types of parameter perturbation: CO2 atmospheric concentration increase initiated by greenhouse effect, and change in the rate of carbon output from dead organic matter and litter which depends on the water table level and possible peat excavation. Calculation of bifurcation curves gives areas in the parameter space where stable functioning of carbon cycle is provided. Steady states can be interpreted as raised bog, meadow, forest and fen. CO2 concentration increase leads the current state of transitional bog to loose stability with appearance of oscillatory dynamics and further evolution to the chaotic attractor. The model is rich by chaotic solutions serving as transition regimes between regular steady and periodic attractors. Another chaotic regime is formed from forest equilibrium and exists in the same area of phase space where current equilibrium is stable. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most northern peatlands developed during the Holocene, sequestering large amounts of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. However, recent syntheses have highlighted the gaps in our understanding of peatland carbon accumulation. Assessments of the long-term carbon accumulation rate and possible warming-driven changes in these accumulation rates can therefore benefit from process-based modelling studies. We employed an individual-based dynamic global ecosystem model with dynamic peatland and permafrost functionalities and patch-based vegetation dynamics to quantify long-term carbon accumulation rates and to assess the effects of historical and projected climate change on peatland carbon balances across the pan-Arctic region. Our results are broadly consistent with published regional and global carbon accumulation estimates. A majority of modelled peatland sites in Scandinavia, Europe, Russia and central and eastern Canada change from carbon sinks through the Holocene to potential carbon sources in the coming century. In contrast, the carbon sink capacity of modelled sites in Siberia, far eastern Russia, Alaska and western and northern Canada was predicted to increase in the coming century. The greatest changes were evident in eastern Siberia, north-western Canada and in Alaska, where peat production hampered by permafrost and low productivity due the cold climate in these regions in the past was simulated to increase greatly due to warming, a wetter climate and higher CO2 levels by the year 2100. In contrast, our model predicts that sites that are expected to experience reduced precipitation rates and are currently permafrost free will lose more carbon in the future.

AB Peatlands are a major terrestrial carbon store and a persistent natural carbon sink during the Holocene, but there is considerable uncertainty over the fate of peatland carbon in a changing climate. It is generally assumed that higher temperatures will increase peat decay, causing a positive feedback to climate warming and contributing to the global positive carbon cycle feedback. Here we use a new extensive database of peat profiles across northern high latitudes to examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation over the past millennium. Opposite to expectations, our results indicate a small negative carbon cycle feedback from past changes in the long-term accumulation rates of northern peatlands. Total carbon accumulated over the last 1000 yr is linearly related to contemporary growing season length and photosynthetically active radiation, suggesting that variability in net primary productivity is more important than decomposition in determining long-term carbon accumulation. Furthermore, northern peatland carbon sequestration rate declined over the climate transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA), probably because of lower LIA temperatures combined with increased cloudiness suppressing net primary productivity. Other factors including changing moisture status, peatland distribution, fire, nitrogen deposition, permafrost thaw and methane emissions will also influence future peatland carbon cycle feedbacks, but our data suggest that the carbon sequestration rate could increase over many areas of northern peatlands in a warmer future.

AB We demonstrate the potential of using freely available satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ sensor for generating carbon balance estimates for lowland peatlands. We used a lowland ombrotrophic peatland in the UK as our test site representing a range of peatland conditions. A literature survey was undertaken to identify the simplest classification schema that could be used to distinguish ecohydrological classes for carbon sequestration on the peatland surface. These were defined as: active raised bog, Eriophorum-dominated bog, milled unvegetated peat and drained or degraded bog, with bracken and Carr woodland to define the bog edges. A maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) was used to map the spatial distribution of the six classes on the peatland surface. A Landsat ETM+ band-5 derived brightness-texture layer created using geostatistical methods greatly improved classification accuracies. The results showed the best accuracy of the MLC, when compared to finer scale methods, with Landsat ETM+ bands alone was 74%, which increased to 93% when including the brightness-texture layer. An estimate of carbon sequestration status of the site was performed that showed good agreement with the results of a finer-scale-based estimate. The coarse-scale map estimating -12000kg carbon and fine scale map estimating +23000kg carbon per annum. We conclude that with further development of our tool, if textural measures are used alongside optical data in MLC, it is possible to achieve good quality estimates of carbon balance status for peatland landscapes. This represents a potentially powerful operational toolkit for land managers and policy makers who require spatially distributed information on carbon storage and release for carbon pricing and effective land management.

AB [1] Cumulative impacts of disturbances on peatland carbon must be understood to predict future soil carbon stocks, yet the vulnerability and response of peatlands to disturbance have been neglected. We provide the first regional-scale assessment of peatland carbon storage across 1.7 million km(2) of western boreal land. We estimate that disturbances, mainly fire, release approximately 6460 +/- 930 GgCyr(-1) to the atmosphere. Concurrently, disturbances reduce carbon uptake in continental peatlands by 85% compared to a no-disturbance scenario. A 17% increase in the area of peatland burned annually and the intensity of organic matter combustion would convert these peatlands into a regional net source of carbon to the atmosphere. Peatlands widely are considered to represent a northern carbon sink, however, we suggest reevaluation of this paradigm for continental boreal regions.

TI EFFECTS OF GLOBAL CLIMATIC WARMING ON THE BOREAL FOREST
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH

DT Article
DE BIOME SHIFT; BOREAL FOREST; CARBON BALANCE; EFFECTS OF CLIMATIC WARMING
AB On the basis of the predictions of the global climatic warming induced by anthropogenic activities, as provided by climatologists, current state of knowledge regarding possible ecological consequences of the warming on the boreal biome was discussed. A 600 to 700 km northward advance of the biome along with the warming was predicted. Such a shift could take place for half a century or so, which would be an unprecedentedly fast rate of progression. This might cause a serious disorder in species composition of the biome, particularly in the boundary regions. As to the carbon sink or source issues, considerable uncertainties and knowledge gaps existed. Elevated temperature and CO2 levels would stimulate photosynthesis to result in an increase of CO2 uptake, while the temperature increase would promote decomposition of organic matter especially that stored in the soils to release CO2 to the atmosphere. Behaviors of northern peat bogs, where ca. 700 Gt of organic matter was thought to be accumulated, would seriously affect the balance. However, overall ecosystematic carbon balance was yet to be fully studied. It was realized that multifunctional approaches needed to be developed so as to integrate pieces of various information into a holistic picture. Need for international collaboration research efforts was also addressed.

AB Organic peat soils have been extensively drained and used for agricultural, horticultural and energy purposes. The management practices of organic soils accelerate decomposition processes resulting generally in loss of carbon. Microbes are the key players in soil carbon cycling. We studied the effects of cultivation of a perennial bioenergy plant (reed canary grass, Phalanx arundinacea) on microbial biomass carbon, microbial respiration and microbial communities in an old, previously uncultivated peat soil. The cultivation increased the amount of microbial biomass carbon and microbial respiration in peat mostly in the uppermost 5 cm layer where the impacts of roots and litter are most pronounced. As shown by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, the abundance of fungi and gram-negative bacteria increased with cultivation, while the abundance of gram-positive bacteria decreased. The implications of these changes on carbon cycling and carbon storage in peat under reed canary grass are discussed.

AB This study aimed to obtain carbon fluxes in the Zoige peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in the contemporary (recent years) and modern era (recent decades) and ancient times (during the Holocene or even longer) using flux tower and modeling approaches. The goal was to understand the carbon fate of alpine peatlands under climate change. Time-weighted average net carbon balance (g C m(-2) yr(-1)) of Zoige peatlands was 189.3 +/- 33.0 in the contemporary era, 80.6 +/- 13.5 in the modern era and 33.5 +/- 5.5 during the Holocene. Historical net carbon balance on these peatlands showed a ladder pattern. The observed carbon accumulation rate was 117.2 +/- 14.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the past 50 years and 94.3 +/- 12.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the past 100 years, which were nearly three times the rate of 36.6 +/- 4.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the long term, even though they had spatial discrepancy due to limited data. Our results indicated variable climatic factors may influence net carbon balance to some extent, and the primary determinant was temperature in the contemporary era, water table in the modern era and temperature in the Holocene, probably.

AB The boreal biome exchanges large amounts of carbon (C) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) with the atmosphere and thus significantly affects the global climate. A managed boreal landscape consists of various sinks and sources of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) across forests, mires, lakes, and streams. Due to the spatial heterogeneity, large uncertainties exist regarding the net landscape carbon balance (NLCB). In this study, we compiled terrestrial and aquatic fluxes of CO2, CH4, DOC, DIC, and harvested C obtained from tall-tower eddy covariance measurements, stream monitoring, and remote sensing of biomass stocks for an entire boreal catchment (68 km(2)) in Sweden to estimate the NLCB across the land-water-atmosphere continuum. Our results showed that this managed boreal forest landscape was a net C sink (NLCB = 39 g C m(-2) year(-1)) with the landscape-atmosphere CO2 exchange being the dominant component, followed by the C export via harvest and streams. Accounting for the global warming potential of CH4, the landscape was a GHG sink of 237 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1), thus providing a climate-cooling effect. The CH4 flux contribution to the annual GHG budget increased from 0.6% during spring to 3.2% during winter. The aquatic C loss was most significant during spring contributing 8% to the annual NLCB. We further found that abiotic controls (e.g., air temperature and incoming radiation) regulated the temporal variability of the NLCB whereas land cover types (e.g., mire vs. forest) and management practices (e.g., clear-cutting) determined their spatial variability. Our study advocates the need for integrating terrestrial and aquatic fluxes at the landscape scale based on tall-tower eddy covariance measurements combined with biomass stock and stream monitoring to develop a holistic understanding of the NLCB of managed boreal forest landscapes and to better evaluate their potential for mitigating climate change.

AB Northern peatlands are an integral part of the global carbon cycle-a strong sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide and source of methane. Increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are thought to strongly impact these environments, and yet, peatlands are not routinely included in Earth system models. Here we present a quantification of the sink and stock of northern peat carbon from the last glacial period through the pre-industrial period. Additional data and new algorithms for reconstructing the history of peat carbon accumulation and the timing of peatland initiation increased the estimate of total northern peat carbon stocks from 545 Gt to 1,055 Gt of carbon. Further, the post-glacial increases in peatland initiation rate and carbon accumulation rate are more abrupt than previously reported. Peatlands have been a strong carbon sink throughout the Holocene, but the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide has been relatively stable over this period. While processes such as permafrost thaw and coral reef development probably contributed some additional carbon to the atmosphere, we suggest that deep ocean upwelling was the most important mechanism for balancing the peatland sink and maintaining the observed stability.

AB Herbivory is an important part of most ecosystems and affects the ecosystems' carbon balance both directly and indirectly. Little is known about herbivory and its impact on the carbon balance in high arctic mire ecosystems. We hypothesized that trampling and grazing by large herbivores influences the vegetation density and composition and thereby also the carbon balance. In 2010, we established fenced exclosures in high arctic Greenland to prevent muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) from grazing. During the growing seasons of 2011 to 2013 we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes in these ungrazed blocks and compared them to blocks subjected to natural grazing. Additionally, we measured depth of the water table and active layer, soil temperature, and in 2011 and 2013 an inventory of the vegetation density and composition were made. In 2013 a significant decrease in total number of vascular plant (33-44%) and Eriophorum scheuchzeri (51-53%) tillers were found in ungrazed plots, the moss-layer and amount of litter had also increased substantially in these plots. This resulted in a significant decrease in net ecosystem uptake of CO2 (47%) and likewise a decrease in CH4 emission (44%) in ungrazed plots in 2013. While the future of the muskoxen in a changing arctic is unknown, this experiment points to a potentially large effect of large herbivores on the carbon balance in natural Arctic ecosystems. It thus sheds light on the importance of grazing mammals, and hence adds to our understanding of natural ecosystem greenhouse gas balance in the past and in the future.

AB Direct measurements of CO2 fluxes by the eddy covariance method have demonstrated that the examined middle-taiga pine forest, raised bog, true steppe, and southern tundra along the Yenisei meridian (similar to 90 degrees E) are carbon sinks of different capacities according to annual output. The tundra acts as a carbon sink starting from June; forest and bog, from May; and steppe, from the end of April. In transitional seasons and winter, the ecosystems are a weak source of carbon; this commences from September in the tundra, from October in the forest and bog, and from November in the steppe. The photosynthetic productivity of forest and steppe ecosystems, amounting to 480-530 g C/(m(2) year), exceeds by 2-2.5 times that of bogs and tundras, 200-220 g C/(m(2) year). The relationships between the heat balance structure and CO2 exchange are shown. Possible feedback of carbon exchange between the ecosystems and atmosphere as a result of climate warming in the region are assessed.

AB This paper provides information on the impact of recent climate change on carbon sequestration in peatland systems in South West England. This is important because peatlands have the potential to sequester and hold large quantities of ant hropogenically released CO2. This paper investigates whether there has been a reduction in the strength of carbon sinks in a valley mire and blanket bog, which occur on the limits of the biogeographical envelop for peallands in Britain. Past rates of carbon accumulation were calculated from peat depth and the sequential analysis of peat age, bulk density and carbon content from cores taken from valley mire and blanket bog. At the valley mire site contemporary net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was calculated by measuring inputs to the peat body, via net primary productivity (NPP), of Sphagna. Losses of C from the peat body were calculated by measuring CH4, and aquatic carbon, calculated from catchment export of particulate and dissolved organic carbon. The study found similar mean rates of carbon accumulation since 1850 of 11.26 t +/- 0.68 t CO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) (307 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in valley mire and 11.77 t +/- 0.88 t CO(2)e ha(-1)yr(-1) (321 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in blanket bog. The mean present-day CO2 sequestration rate for Sphagna on valley mire was calculated to be 9.13 t +/- 0.98 t CO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) (249 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Both past and contemporary rates of CO2 sequestration were found to be at the maxima of those reported for temperate peatlands. NPP was found to vary according to microform with higher rates of carbon sequestration found in lawn and hummock microforms compared with pools. Our work suggests that recent changes in the climate appear to have had limited impact on the strength of peatland carbon sinks in South West England. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Future climate change and other anthropogenic activities are likely to increase nutrient availability in many peatlands, and it is important to understand how these additional nutrients will influence peatland carbon cycling. We investigated the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus on aerobic CH4 oxidation, anaerobic carbon mineralization ( as CO2 and CH4 production), and anaerobic nutrient mineralization in a bog, an intermediate fen, and a rich fen in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We utilized a 5-week laboratory nutrient amendment experiment in conjunction with a 6-year field nutrient fertilization experiment to consider how the relative response to nitrogen and phosphorus differed among these wetlands over the short and long term. Field fertilizations generally increased nutrient availability in the upper 15 cm of peat and resulted in shifts in the vegetation community in each peatland. High nitrogen concentrations inhibited CH4 oxidation in bog peat during short-term incubations; however, long-term fertilization with lower concentrations of nitrogen stimulated rates of CH4 oxidation in bog peat. In contrast, no nitrogen effects on CH4 oxidation were observed in the intermediate or rich fen peat. Anaerobic carbon mineralization in bog peat was consistently inhibited by increased phosphorus availability, but similar phosphorus additions had few effects in the intermediate fen and stimulated CH4 production and nutrient mineralization in the rich fen. Our results demonstrate that nitrogen and phosphorus are important controls of peatland microbial carbon cycling; however, the role of these nutrients can differ over the short and long term and is strongly mediated by peatland type.

AB Growth and decomposition of Sphagnum controls turnover of a large global store of soil organic carbon. We investigated variation in morphological and physiological traits of Sphagnum shoots, and related this variation to canopy variables relevant to peatland carbon cycling. We sampled Sphagnum along a bog plateau-swamp forest gradient and measured a suite of shoot traits and canopy variables. Major axes of variation were identified using principal component analysis and correlated with canopy variables such as growth, biomass and decomposition. We also examined scaling of shoot traits with one another and with canopy variables. Two distinct tradeoffs in shoot traits emerged. From dry to wet habitats, individual metabolic rates and capitulum size increased while numerical density decreased, leading to faster growth and elongation on an individual basis. From treed to open habitats, photosynthetic efficiency decreased and photosynthetic biomass increased, driving faster growth on an area basis and slower litter mass loss. The tradeoffs identified have important implications for peatlands undergoing climate-related changes in water and light availability. Sphagnum trait comparisons, combined with scaling analyses, offer a promising approach to understanding and predicting the effects of environmental change on peatland carbon cycling.

AB Generalized data on carbon dioxide and methane emission that were obtained from a study of different bog ecosystems in the northern, middle, and southern taiga subzones using a uniform procedure are presented. The average estimates of the CO2 and CH4 contents in the surface atmosphere layer and boo water are given. The main carbon-cycle constituents of the boo ecosystems are scrutinized both for different subzones and for the entire territory of the forest-bog zone. The tendency to sequestering carbon by the West Siberian bogs along the latitudinal-zonal climatic gradient is discussed. The reassimilation of CO2 inside the peat massif is proved experimentally. A new conceptual model of the carbon cycle in surface ecosystems is developed on this basis.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the requirements including culture medium, temperature, pH, carbon and nitrogen sources for the best mycelium growth of Lactarius pyrogalus and Lactarius controversus. Different inoculum media containing peat and peat : vermiculite mixtures (1:4, 1:6, 1:8 and 1:10 v: v) were also investigated for vegetative inoculum production. In terms of mycelium growth rate and mycelial characteristics, the most suitable culture media were potato dextrose agar and biotin aneurin folic acid agar for L. pyrogalus and L. controversus. Although L. pyrogalus had higher mycelium growth rate than L. controversus, they showed similar trend at different temperature. 25 degrees C and 4.5 to 6.0 pH values gave the best results for mycelial growth of these mushrooms. Mannitol, glucose, dextrose and maltose were the most suitable carbon sources for L. pyrogalus, while mannitol, and lactose were the best carbon sources for L. controversus and significantly enhanced mycelial growth. Malt extract, peptone, yeast extract and Ca(NO3)(2) were found to be the most suitable nitrogen sources for both Lactarius species, except for peptone in L. controversus. The lowest mycelial growth was determined in xylose among carbon sources, and NH4NO3 and (NH4)(2)HPO4 among nitrogen sources for both Lactarius species. Peat : vermiculite mixtures in the rate of 1:4 and peat were the most suitable vegetative inoculum medium for L. pyrogalus and L. controversus, respectively, when the mycelium growth rate and days to complete mycelium running took into consideration.

AB Global change, like droughts, can destabilize the carbon sink function of peatlands, either directly or indirectly through changes in plant community composition. While the effects of drought and plant community composition on individual carbon (C) related processes are well understood, their effect on multiple C-related processes simultaneouslymultifunctionality-is poorly known. We studied the effect of drought on four C-related processes (net and gross CO2 exchange, methane fluxes, and dissolved organic carbon content) in a plant removal experiment. Plant functional type (PFT) removal (graminoids, herbs, Polytrichum spp., incl. combinations) negatively affected multifunctionality; most markedly when all PFTswere removed. Our results corroborate a negative drought effect on C-related multifunctionality. Drought reduced multifunctionality, and this reduction was again largest when all PFTs were removed. Our data further indicate that much of these negative drought effects were carried over and maintained from the initial removal treatment. These results suggest that while a high diversity in plant functional types is associated to high C-related multifunctionality, plant community assembly does not drive the ability of peatlands to withstand the negative impacts of drought on multifunctionality. Hence, to safeguard the carbon cycling function in intact peatlands, the effects of climate change on the functional composition of the peatland plant community needs to be minimized.

SO JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS

DE Wood energy; Green house gases; Forest sector; Carbon debt
ID BIOMASS EQUATIONS; FOREST; MODEL
AB Forests play an important role in mitigating climate change. Forests can sequester carbon from the atmosphere and provide biomass, which can be used to substitute for fossil fuels or energy-intensive materials. International climate policies favor the use of wood to substitute for fossil fuels rather than using forests as carbon sink. We examine the trade off between sequestering carbon in forests and substituting wood for fossil fuels in Finland. For Finland to meet its EU targets for the use of renewable energy by 2020, a considerable increase in the use of wood for energy is necessary. We compare scenarios in which the wood energy targets are fully or partially met to a reference case where policies favoring wood based energy production are removed. Three models are used to project fossil fuel substitution and changes in forest carbon sinks in the scenarios through 2035.
   Finnish forests are a growing carbon sink in all scenarios. However, net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be higher in the medium term if Finland achieves its current wood energy targets than if the use of energy wood stagnates or decreases. The volume of GHG emissions avoided by replacing coal, peat and fossil diesel with wood is outweighed by the loss in carbon sequestered in forests due to increased biomass removals. Therefore, the current wood energy targets seem excessive and harmful to the climate. In particular, biodiesel production has a significant, negative impact on net emissions in the period considered. However, we did not consider risks such as forest fires, wind damage and diseases, which might weaken the sequestration policy. The potential albedo impacts of harvesting the forests were not considered either. (C) 2013 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

AB Pseudomonas acidovorans DMR-11, capable of oxidizing dimethyl sulfide (DMS), was isolated from peat biofilter.  DMS as a sole carbon or energy source was not degraded, but it was co-degraded in the medium containing organic carbon sources.  The removal rate of DMS in heat-treated glucose medium was 1.12 x 10(-17) mole/h.cell at 30-degrees-C.  Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was the only product of DMS oxidation and was formed stoichiometrically.  DMS was reversibly evolved in excess of DMSO).  The cell free extract of strain DMR-11 oxidized DMS in presence of NADPH.

AB Fluvial organic carbon (OC) transformations are an important component of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas production in inland waters resulting in considerable recent interest in the fate of fluvial OC exported from carbon rich soils such as peatlands. Additionally, peatland catchments are important drinking water collection areas, where high OC concentrations in runoff have water treatment implications. This analysis presents the results from a year-round intensive study within a water treatment catchment draining an area of peatland, considering carbon transformations along a continuum from headwater river, through a storage reservoir and pipe, to a water treatment works. The study uses a unique combination of methods (colourmetric, ultrafiltration, and C-14 radiocarbon dating) to assess catchment wide changes in fluvial carbon composition (colour, size, and age) alongside concentration measures. The results indicate clear patterns of carbon transformations in the river and reservoir and dissolved low molecular weight coloured carbon to be most subject to change, with both loss and replacement within the catchment residence time. Although the evidence suggests dissolved OC (DOC) gains are from particulate OC breakdown, the mechanisms of DOC loss are less certain and may represent greenhouse gas losses or conversions to particulate OC. The transformations presented here appear to have minimal impact on the amount of harder to treat (<10kDa) dissolved carbon, although they do have implications for total DOC loading to water treatment works. This paper shows that peatland fluvial systems are not passive receptors of particulate and dissolved organic carbon but locations where carbon is actively cycled, with implications for the understanding of carbon cycling and water treatment in peatland catchments.

AB [1] Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in a palsa mire characterized by dry (palsa) and wet surfaces in a subarctic zone in Finland were measured using a static chamber technique during two climatically different years, 1998 and 1999. Each of the 24 collars was individually studied for water table level, peat temperature, pH, vegetation, frost depth, CO2 exchange and CH4 fluxes. The annual gaseous carbon balance varied from -36.9 g C m(-2) to -138.6 g C m(-2) (uptake) on wet surfaces. During both years, palsa surfaces with shrub vegetation were sinks for carbon, whereas palsa surfaces with sparse vegetation lost carbon to the atmosphere. In 1999, a wet year, a lower NEE resulted mainly from a decrease in photosynthesis. The annual emissions of CH4 ranged from 1.0 g CH4-C m(-2) in the palsa to 24.7 g CH4-C m(-2) at the palsa margin. On wet surfaces, photosynthesis, respiration and CH4 fluxes were tightly linked. Annual NEE and CH4 fluxes were close to the values reported for boreal peatlands (fens).

AB The Chronos (14)Carbon-Cycle Facility is a new radiocarbon laboratory at the University of New South Wales. Australia. Built around an Ionplus 200 kV MIni-CArbon DAting System (MICADAS) Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) installed in October 2019, the facility was established to address major challenges in the Earth, Environmental and Archaeological sciences. Here we report an overview of the Chronos facility, the pretreatment methods currently employed (bones, carbonates, peat, pollen, charcoal, and wood) and results of radiocarbon and stable isotope measurements undertaken on a wide range of sample types. Measurements on international standards. known-age and blank samples demonstrate the facility is capable of measuring C-14 samples from the Anthropocene back to nearly 50,000 years ago. Future work will focus on improving our understanding of the Earth system and managing resources in a future warmer world.

AB Over 50% of UK soil carbon is stored in peatland systems and 75% of these peatlands are upland blanket bog. The upland blanket bogs of the UK have suffered severe erosion over the last millennium so that they are widely dissected by gully systems. Gully erosion entails primary removal of particulate carbon from the peatland system but also has secondary effects in that it enhances drainage and lowers water tables, potentially enhancing decomposition of surface peats. This paper exploits recent high resolution mapping of the gully erosion on the Bleaklow Plateau in the southern Pennines and existing data on peat growth rates in the area to assess the impact of gully erosion on peatland carbon balance and the relative importance of primary and secondary impacts of gullying on carbon sequestration. The results indicate that gully erosion during the last millennium has shifted the Bleaklow Plateau from being a net sink of carbon (-20.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) to a net source (29.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The relative importance of gullying impacts can be expressed as follows: particulate organic carbon (POC) flux > change in gully net ecosystem exchange >> loss of gully margin carbon sequestration. The implication of these findings is that the magnitude of the potentially reversible impacts of gully erosion (reduced carbon fixation due to vegetation loss and ongoing erosional loss of POC) far exceed the effects associated with irreversible morphological change (enhanced peat decomposition in gully margin locations).

AB This paper presents the results of experiments on the polishing of synthetic electroplating wastewater in microcosm fill-and-drain constructed wetlands. The experimental system consisted of two types of columns (in duplicate): filled with gravel or peat/gravel mixture. All the columns were vegetated. The feed of the system contained metals (Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn), cyanides and sulfates, and was prepared to simulate the treated or pretreated electroplating wastewater. The experiment was designed to study the effect of batch duration (1 or 2 weeks), wastewater strength and the type of organic carbon source used to stimulate the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria. It was found that the use of constructed wetlands filled with gravel and amended with external carbon source (lactates) is more advantageous than the use of system filled with peat as internal carbon source. The former type of system offers high removal efficiency for metals and cyanides. It was found that the extended batch duration promotes the removal of metals. The obtained results suggest that the increased concentration of metals in the influent corresponds to the increased removal efficiency for these metals, with the opposite observation for metals at a constant concentration in the effluent.

AB Peatlands, including fens, are important ecosystems in the context of the global carbon cycle. Future climate change and other anthropogenic activities are likely to increase nutrient loading in many peatland ecosystems and a better understanding of the effects of these nutrients on peatland carbon cycling is necessary. We investigated the effects of six years of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization, along with liming, on carbon mineralization dynamics in an intermediate fen in northern Minnesota. Specifically, we measured CO2 and CH4 emission from intact peat cores, as well as CH4 production and CH4 consumption at multiple depths in short-term laboratory incubations. Despite increased nitrogen and phosphorus availability in the upper 5 cm of peat, increased pH, and clear shifts in the vegetation community, fertilization and liming had limited effects on microbial carbon cycling in this fen. Liming reduced the net flux Of CO2 approximately 3-fold compared to the control treatment, but liming had no effect on CH4 emissions from intact cores. There were no nutrient effects on CO2 or CH4 emissions from intact cores. In all treatments, rates of CH4 production increased with depth and rates of CH4 consumption were highest near the in situ water-table level. However, nutrient and liming had no effect on rates of CH4 production or CH4 consumption at any depth. Our results suggest that over at least the intermediate term, the microbial communities responsible for soil carbon cycling in this peatland are tolerant to wide ranges of nutrient concentrations and pH levels and may be relatively insensitive to future anthropogenic nutrient stress.

AB The late Paleocene to the early Eocene (approximate to 58-52 Ma) was marked by significant changes in global climate and carbon cycling. The evidence for these changes includes stable isotope records that reveal prominent decreases in O-18 and C-13, suggesting a rise in Earth's surface temperature (approximate to 4 degrees C) and a drop in net carbon output from the ocean and atmosphere. Concurrently, deep-sea carbonate records at several sites indicate a deepening of the calcite compensation depth (CCD). Here we investigate possible causes (e.g., increased volcanic degassing or decreased net organic burial) for these observations, but from a new perspective. The basic model employed is a modified version of GEOCARB III. However, we have coupled this well-known geochemical model to LOSCAR (Long-term Ocean-atmosphere Sediment CArbon cycle Reservoir model), which enables simulation of seawater carbonate chemistry, the CCD, and ocean C-13. We have also added a capacitor, in this case represented by gas hydrates, that can store and release(13)C-depleted carbon to and from the shallow geosphere over millions of years. We further consider accurate input data (e.g., C-13 of carbonate) on a currently accepted timescale that spans an interval much longer than the perturbation. Several different scenarios are investigated with the goal of consistency amongst inferred changes in temperature, the CCD, and surface ocean and deep ocean C-13. The results strongly suggest that a decrease in net organic carbon burial drove carbon cycle changes during the late Paleocene and early Eocene, although an increase in volcanic activity might have contributed. Importantly, a drop in net organic carbon burial may represent increased oxidation of previously deposited organic carbon, such as stored in peat or gas hydrates. The model successfully recreates trends in Earth surface warming, as inferred from O-18 records, the CCD, and C-13. At the moment, however, our coupled modeling effort cannot reproduce the magnitude of change in all these records collectively. Similar problems have arisen in simulations of short-term hyperthermal events during the early Paleogene (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum), suggesting one or more basic issues with data interpretation or geochemical modeling remain.

AB The U.K. has extensive databases on soils, land cover and historic land use change which have made it possible to construct a comprehensive inventory of the principal terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon for approximately the year 1990, using methods that are consistent with, and at least as accurate as, the revised 1996 guidelines recommended by IPCC where available - and including categories which are not currently considered under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This country inventory highlights issues concerning methodology, uncertainty, double counting, the importance of soils and the relative magnitude of sources and sinks which are reported to the UNFCCC relative to other sources and sinks.
   The carbon sinks (negative values in MtC a(-1)) for categories reported to the UNFCCC, based on the IPCC categories, were estimated to be: forest trees and litter (-2.1), U.K. forest products (-0.5, ignoring imports and exports), non-forest biomass (-0.3), forest soils (-0.1) and soils on set-aside land (-0.4). The carbon sources (positive values) reported under the UNFCCC were estimated to be: losses of soil organic carbon resulting from cultivation of semi-natural land (6.2) and from urbanization (1.6), drainage of peatlands (0.3) and fenlands (0.5), and peat extraction (0.2). A range of other sources and sinks not covered by the IPCC guidelines were also quantified, namely, the accumulation of carbon in undrained peatlands (-0.7, ignoring methane emission), sediment accretion in coastal marshes (-0.1), the possible U.K. share of the CO2 and N fertilization carbon sink (-2.0) and riverine organic and particulate carbon export to the sea (1.4, which may be assumed to be a source if most of this carbon is released as CO2 in the sea). All sinks totalled -6.2 and sources 10.2, giving a net flux to the atmosphere in 1990 of 4.0 MtC a(-)1. Uncertainties associated with categories, mostly based on best guesses, ranged from +/-15% for forest biomass and litter to +/-60% for CO2 and N fertilization.

TI Do we miss the hot spots? - The use of very high resolution aerial
   photographs to quantify carbon fluxes in peatlands
SO BIOGEOSCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID MICROSITES; FEN
AB Accurate determination of carbon balances in heterogeneous ecosystems often requires the extrapolation of point based measurements. The ground resolution (pixel size) of the extrapolation base, e.g. a land-cover map, might thus influence the calculated carbon balance, in particular if biogeochemical hot spots are small in size. In this paper, we test the effects of varying ground resolution on the calculated carbon balance of a boreal peatland consisting of hummocks (dry), lawns (intermediate) and flarks (wet surfaces). The generalizations in lower resolution imagery led to biased area estimates for individual micro-site types. While areas of lawns and hummocks were stable below a threshold resolution of similar to 60 cm, the maximum of the flark area was located at resolutions below 25 cm and was then decreasing with coarsening resolution. Using a resolution of 100 cm instead of 6 cm led to an overestimation of total CO2 uptake of the studied peatland area (approximately 14 600 m(2)) of similar to 5% and an underestimation of total CH4 emission of similar to 6%. To accurately determine the surface area of scattered and small-sized micro-site types in heterogeneous ecosystems (e.g. flarks in peatlands), a minimum ground resolution appears necessary. In our case this leads to a recommended resolution of 25 cm, which can be derived by conventional airborne imagery. The usage of high resolution imagery from commercial satellites, e.g. Quickbird, however, is likely to underestimate the surface area of biogeochemical hot spots. It is important to note that the observed resolution effect on the carbon balance estimates can be much stronger for other ecosystems than for the investigated peatland. In the investigated peatland the relative hot spot area of the flarks is very small and their hot spot characteristics with respect to CH4 and CO2 fluxes is rather modest.

AB The peat soils that underlie much of the UK uplands contain a significant store of carbon and although carbon cycling in UK peat has received a great deal of research attention there are relatively little data available on the physical impact of grazing on carbon dynamics in peat soils. Therefore, this study asked whether trampling of peat soils had a significant effect on a major carbon flux pathway of peat ecosystems i.e. surface exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere. This study simulated regular trampling by sheep on peat cores for a period of 6 months and monitored the CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. Additionally, it also investigated the impact of the cessation of trampling.
   Results show that photosynthesis and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 were significantly decreased following trampling by up to 75% relative to control cores. Cessation of trampling led to a significant increase in ecosystem respiration after just 3 months but photosynthesis and net ecosystem exchange were not significantly different to the pre-cessation period.

AB The growing demand for agricultural products has been leading to an expansion and intensification of agriculture around the world. More and more unused land is currently reclaimed in the regions of the former Soviet Union. Driven by climate change, the Western Siberian grain belt might, in a long-term, even expand into the drained peatland areas to the North. It is crucial to study the consequences of this land-use change with respect to the carbon cycling as this is still a major knowledge gap.
   We present for the first time data on the atmosphere-ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide and methane of an arable field and a neighboring unused grassland on peat soil in Western Siberia. Eddy covariance measurements were performed over one vegetation period. No directed methane fluxes were found due to an effective drainage of the study sites. The carbon dioxide fluxes appeared to be of high relevance for the global carbon and greenhouse gas cycles. They showed very site-specific patterns resulting from the development of vegetation: the persistent plants of the grassland were able to start photosynthesizing soon after snow melt, while the absence of vegetation on the managed field lead to a phase of emissions until the oat plants started to grow in June. The uptake peak of the oat field is much later than that of the grassland, but larger due to a rapid plant growth. Budgeting the whole measurement period, the grassland served as a carbon sink, whereas the oat field was identified to be a carbon source. The conversion from non-used grasslands on peat soil to cultivated fields in Western Siberia is therefore considered to have a positive feedback on climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Climate change projections forecast an intensification of the precipitation regime for many regions of the globe, including central North America, with fewer, larger events interspersed between longer periods devoid of rain or snow. This shift has the potential to affect the carbon cycling of peatland ecosystems, including the flux of methane from the peat. We conducted a field manipulation experiment where irrigation treatments were used to simulate different seasonal rainfall regimes. The treatments were designed such that total seasonal rainfall was held constant but discrete event frequency and magnitude were altered between treatments in a poor fen in southern Ontario, Canada. The rainfall regime was controlled over three vegetation types: Sphagnum capillifolium (moss); Carex oligoperma (sedge); and Chamaedaphne calyculata (shrub). Decreasing rainfall frequency from thrice-weekly to bi-monthly [ coupled with 6X increase in event intensity] led to significantly greater CH4 flux from the moss and sedge communities in the latter third of the growing season. The shrub communities were unaffected by the changing rainfall regime. A companion lab mesocosm experiment revealed the control the fluctuating water table had on the CH4 fluxes from the vegetation community, particularly from the moss communities. Overall, there were significantly greater CH4 fluxes from all communities with increasing days since the previous rainfall event. As precipitation frequency decreases results of this study demonstrate the potential for increased CH4 flux to the atmosphere from peatland areas dominated by Sphagnum and herbaceous species. Wetland restoration and creation projects should consider these effects on peatland carbon cycling and function. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we provide a quantification of the main patterns of change of a subarctic peatland caused by permafrost decay monitored between 1957 and 2003. Up-thrusting of the peatland surface due to permafrost aggradation during the Little Ice Age resulted in the formation of an extensive peat plateau that gradually fragmented into residual palsas from the 19th century to the present. Only about 18% of the original surface occupied by permafrost was thawed in 1957, whereas only 13% was still surviving in 2003. Rapid permafrost melting over the last 50 years caused the concurrent formation of thermokarst ponds and fen-bog vegetation with rapid peat accumulation through natural successional processes of terrestrialization. The main climatic driver for accelerated permafrost thawing was snow precipitation which increased from 1957 to present while annual and seasonal temperatures remained relatively stable until about the mid-1990s when annual temperature rose well above the mean. Contrary to current expectations, the melting of permafrost caused by recent climate change does not transform the peatland to a carbon-source ecosystem as rapid terrestrialization exacerbates carbon-sink conditions and tends to balance the local carbon budget.

AB Boreal and subarctic peatlands are an important dynamical component of the earth system. They are sensitive to climate change, and could either continue to serve as a carbon sink or become a carbon source. Climatic thresholds for switching peatlands from sink to source are not well defined, and therefore, incorporating peatlands into Earth system models is a challenging task. Here we introduce a climatic index, warm precipitation excess, to delineate the potential geographic distribution of boreal peatlands for a given climate and landscape morphology. This allows us to explain the present-day distribution of peatlands in Western Siberia, their absence during the Last Glacial Maximum, their expansion during the mid-Holocene, and to form a working hypothesis about the trend to peatland degradation in the southern taiga belt of Western Siberia under an RCP 8.5 scenario for the projected climate in year 2100.

AB Researchers have proposed that a significant portion of the post-glacial rise in atmospheric CO2 could be due to the respiration of permafrost carbon stocks that formed over the course of glaciation. In this paper, we used the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model v. 2.9 to simulate the deglacial and interglacial carbon cycle from the last glacial maximum to the present. The model's sensitivity to mid and high latitude terrestrial carbon storage is evaluated by including a 600 Pg C carbon pool parameterized to respire in concert with decreases in ice sheet surface area. The respiration of this stored carbon during the early stages of deglaciation had a large effect on the carbon cycle in these simulations, allowing atmospheric CO2 to increase by 40 ppmv in the model, with an additional 20 ppmv increase occurring in the case of a more realistic, prescribed CO2 radiative warming. These increases occurred prior to large-scale carbon uptake due to the reestablishment of boreal forests and peatlands in the proxy record (beginning in the early Holocene). Surprisingly, the large external carbon input to the atmosphere and oceans did not increase sediment dissolution and mean ocean alkalinity relative to a control simulation without the high latitude carbon reservoir. In addition, our simulations suggest that an early deglacial terrestrial carbon release may come closer to explaining some observed deglacial changes in deep-ocean carbonate concentrations than simulations without such a release. We conclude that the respiration of glacial soil carbon stores may have been an important contributor to the deglacial CO2 rise, particularly in the early stages of deglaciation.

ID MANURE DECOMPOSITION
AB The potential of herbage composts as horticultural substrate and source of nutrients was investigated. The effect of botanical composition of the herbage, as well as the effect of different kinds and amounts of carbon sources, on nitrogen losses during composting and growth properties of the compost were studied. Growth tests with different plant species as well as chemical analyses of total- and easily-soluble plant nutrients were used to evaluate compost quality. Seven herbage composts were studied and used in growth tests with seven different test plants. The results were evaluated by conventional and multivariate statistical methods.
   Accumulated nitrogen losses tended to vary with carbon source added, and were 2-25% of the initial N content over a 130-day composting period. Plant growth and seed germination were largely explained by the electrical conductivity of the compost mixes. Potassium concentrations were very high in the composts. The results showed the possibility of using herbage composts as part of a substrate for container-grown vegetables and flowers. All of the composts which were tested required mixing with nutrient-poor material in order to become a suitable substrate, mainly to avoid excessive conductivity. In a substrate based on sphagnum peat, 10-100% of the peat might be substituted with herbage compost, depending on the amount of carbon source added during composting. A considerable amount of the plant nutrients needed in the substrate for the initial six weeks of plant growth was found to be supplied by the herbage compost.

AB Bacteria were isolated and characterized from uncolonized soil, nonmycorrhizal and mycorrhizal short roots, and soil-colonizing external mycelium from intact Pinus sylvestris - Suillus bovinus and Pinus sylvestris - Paxillus involutus mycorrhizospheres developed in microcosms containing dry pine forest humus or nursery peat. Total numbers of colony-forming units (CFU/mg dry weight) in the different locations from all ectomycorrhizospheres indicated an overall bacterial-enrichment gradient towards the roots, whereas sporeformers were more evenly distributed. Fluorescent pseudomonads were commonly isolated from all mycorrhizosphere locations in nursery peat, but they were nearly absent from the forest humus community. In contrast, sporeformers were more abundant at all locations in the latter growth substrate. The;bacterial species composition of forest and nursery mycorrhizospheres was clearly divergent when characterized according to their carbon source utilization patterns in Biolog(R) GN or GP microplates. Factorial-designed ANOVA of a principal component analysis of the carbon source utilization data showed significant differences between isolates from the two soil types and, to a lesser extent, between S. bovinus and Paxillus involutus mycorrhizospheres. Bacterial communities from mycorrhizospheres and uncolonized soil were distinguished by their preferential utilization of carbohydrates and organic and amino acids, respectively. Suillus bovinus associated bacteria appeared to favour mannitol and Paxillus involutus associated bacteria appeared to favour fructose as carbon sources. This study demonstrates the combined effect of soil type, fungal symbiont, and precise location on bacterial communities associated with Pinus sylvestris ectomycorrhizospheres.

AB The notion is pervasive in the climate science community and in the public at large that the climate impacts of fossil fuel CO2 release will only persist for a few centuries. This conclusion has no basis in theory or models of the atmosphere/ocean carbon cycle, which we review here. The largest fraction of the CO2 recovery will take place on time scales of centuries, as CO2 invades the ocean, but a significant fraction of the fossil fuel CO2, ranging in published models in the literature from 20-60%, remains airborne for a thousand years or longer. Ultimate recovery takes place on time scales of hundreds of thousands of years, a geologic longevity typically associated in public perceptions with nuclear waste. The glacial/interglacial climate cycles demonstrate that ice sheets and sea level respond dramatically to millennial-timescale changes in climate forcing. There are also potential positive feedbacks in the carbon cycle, including methane hydrates in the ocean, and peat frozen in permafrost, that are most sensitive to the long tail of the fossil fuel CO2 in the atmosphere.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle as they contain a large soil carbon stock. However, current climate change could potentially shift peatlands from being carbon sinks to carbon sources. Remote sensing methods provide an opportunity to monitor carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange in peatland ecosystems at large scales under these changing conditions. In this study, we developed empirical models of the CO2 balance (net ecosystem exchange, NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (ER) that could be used for upscaling CO2 fluxes with remotely sensed data. Two to three years of eddy covariance (EC) data from five peatlands in Sweden and Finland were compared to modelled NEE, GPP and ER based on vegetation indices from 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 MSI and land surface temperature from 1 km resolution MODIS data. To ensure a precise match between the EC data and the Sentinel-2 observations, a footprint model was applied to derive footprint-weighted daily means of the vegetation indices. Average model parameters for all sites were acquired with a leave-one-out-cross-validation procedure. Both the GPP and the ER models gave high agreement with the EC-derived fluxes (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.56, NRMSE = 14% and 15%, respectively). The performance of the NEE model was weaker (average R-2 = 0.36 and NRMSE = 13%). Our findings demonstrate that using optical and thermal satellite sensor data is a feasible method for upscaling the GPP and ER of northern boreal peatlands, although further studies are needed to investigate the sources of the unexplained spatial and temporal variation of the CO2 fluxes.

AB Current projections suggest that climate warming will be accompanied by more frequent and severe drought events. Peatlands store ca. one third of the world's soil organic carbon. Warming and drought may cause peatlands to become carbon sources through stimulation of microbial activity increasing ecosystem respiration, with positive feedback effect on global warming. Micro-eukaryotes play a key role in the carbon cycle through food web interactions and therefore, alterations in their community structure and diversity may affect ecosystem functioning and could reflect these changes. We assessed the diversity and community composition of Sphagnum-associated eukaryotic microorganisms inhabiting peatlands and their response to experimental drought and warming using high throughput sequencing of environmental DNA. Under drier conditions, micro-eukaryotic diversity decreased, the relative abundance of autotrophs increased and that of osmotrophs (including Fungi and Peronosporomycetes) decreased. Furthermore, we identified climate change indicators that could be used as early indicators of change in peatland microbial communities and ecosystem functioning. The changes we observed indicate a shift towards a more "terrestrial'' community in response to drought, in line with observed changes in the functioning of the ecosystem.

AB The observed increase in emission of greenhouse gases, with attendant effects on global warming, have raised interests in identifying sources and sinks of carbon in the environment. Terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Particularly, wetland systems function primarily as long-term reservoirs for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and as sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of carbon reservoirs in two high-altitude wetlands in the central Andean mountain of Colombia. Carbon cycle in both systems is related mainly with the plant biomass dynamics from the littoral zone. Thus, total organic carbon concentrate an average up to 329 kg of N ha(-1) and 125 kg of P ha(-1) every year vs only 17 kg N ha(-1) and 6 kg P ha(-1) in the water column of the limnetic zone in the wetland, evidencing spatial differences in carbon concentrations for these types of ecosystems. Results revealed that these systems participate in the balance and sequestration of carbon in the Colombian Andes.

AB 1. Plant species affect ecosystem carbon uptake via biomass production and carbon release via decomposition processes. Differences in their responses to climate change and effects on ecosystem carbon cycling processes may thus feedback to the atmospheric carbon balance and the climate at a global scale. Hierarchical species classifications based on plant growth forms are widely used in cold, northern biomes to generalize and predict these differences. This review investigates the usefulness of broad (vascular, non-vascular), intermediate (woody, non-woody) and narrow (evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs, graminoids, forbs) plant growth-form-based groups in these biomes for predicting plant responses to climate change and effects on the main processes of the full carbon cycle by looking at the similarity of species within growth-form groups and the consistency of differences among groups under changing environmental conditions.
   2. Production responses to climate change differ between broad growth-form groups, but their opposite responses do not imply that the responses of non-vascular plants are consistently negative. Within vascular growth forms, production responses to climate change are not always similar among species under identical conditions, and average differences among narrow vascular growth forms are usually small. Moreover, differences in production responses among growth forms strongly depend upon the duration of the study, the region and the ecosystem type.
   3. Species within narrow growth forms show a high similarity for a range of leaf litter chemistry variables and differences among narrow growth forms are often large and consistent. However, differences in leaf litter decomposability are large between broad growth-form groups, but small and environment-dependent among important narrow vascular growth forms. Litter feedback effects to plant production vary among narrow vascular growth forms, but the differences strongly depend on the study duration. Data on the climate dependence of growth-form differences regarding this aspect of the carbon cycle are currently lacking.
   4. Synthesis: Overall, the usefulness of growth-form-based groups clearly differs between carbon cycling processes. Different aggregation levels are therefore needed for different processes. For most processes there is evidence that the differences among growth forms depend on environmental conditions, which hampers their use for generalizations and modelling. Future studies should therefore explicitly test for differences among growth-form groups and aim to unravel the dependence of growth-form differences on environmental conditions.

AB The objective of this study was to identify low-cost natural amendments that could be used as carbon sources and sustain a bioactive zone to promote biodegradation of TCE in contaminated shallow groundwater. The natural amendments were compared based on their geophysical characteristics as well as TCE adsorption capacities. The amendments studied included low-cost natural and agricultural materials such as eucalyptus tree mulch, pine bark mulch, muck from the Florida Everglades, SRS wetland peat, commercial compost, and peat humus. These natural substrates have relatively high organic fractions that can retard the movement of TCE while serving as carbon sources. Batch sorption studies were conducted to determine the sorption and retardation characteristics of the amendments for TCE. The experimental results were analyzed in relation to the geophysical characteristics of the amendments and compared with those of natural soils.

AB Extracellular phenoloxidase enzymes play an important role in the stability of soil carbon storage by contributing to the cycling of complex recalcitrant phenolic compounds. Climate warming could affect peatland functioning through an alteration of polyphenol/phenoloxidase interplay, which could lead them to becoming weaker sinks of carbon. Here, we assessed the seasonal variability of total phenolics and phenoloxidases subjected to 2-3 degrees C increase in air temperature using open-top chambers. The measurements were performed along a narrow fen-bog ecological gradient over one growing season. Climate warming had a weak effect on phenoloxidases, but reduced phenolics in both fen and bog areas. Multivariate analyses revealed a split between the areas and also showed that climate warming exacerbated the seasonal variability of polyphenols, culminating in a destabilization of the carbon cycle. A negative relationship between polyphenols and phenoloxidases was recorded in controls and climate treatments suggesting an inhibitory effect of phenolics on phenoloxidases. Any significant decrease of phenolics through repeatedly elevated temperature would greatly impact the ecosystem functioning and carbon cycle through an alteration of the interaction of polyphenols with microbial communities and the production of extracellular enzymes. Our climate treatments did not have the same impact along the fen-bog gradient and suggested that not all the peatland habitats would respond similarly to climate forcing.

AB Although northern peatlands cover only 3% of the land surface, their thick peat deposits contain an estimated one-third of the world's soil organic carbon (SOC). Under a changing climate the potential of peatlands to continue sequestering carbon is unknown. This paper presents an analysis of 6 years of total carbon balance of an almost intact Atlantic blanket bog in Glencar, County Kerry, Ireland. The three components of the measured carbon balance were: the land-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported in a stream draining the peatland. The 6 years C balance was computed from 6 years (2003-2008) of measurements of meteorological and eddy-covariance CO2 fluxes, periodic chamber measurements of CH4 fluxes over 3.5 years, and 2 years of continuous DOC flux measurements. Over the 6 years, the mean annual carbon was -29.7 +/- 30.6 (+/- 1 SD) g C m-2 yr-1 with its components as follows: carbon in CO2 was a sink of -47.8 +/- 30.0 g C m-2 yr-1; carbon in CH4 was a source of 4.1 +/- 0.5 g C m-2 yr-1 and the carbon exported as stream DOC was a source of 14.0 +/- 1.6 g C m-2 yr-1. For 2 out of the 6 years, the site was a source of carbon with the sum of CH4 and DOC flux exceeding the carbon sequestered as CO2. The average C balance for the 6 years corresponds to an average annual growth rate of the peatland surface of 1.3 mm yr-1.

AB Aim Persistent sinks of atmospheric CO2 in undisturbed peatlands are not included in future projections of the global carbon budget. We aimed to explore possible responses of northern peatlands to future climate change and to quantify the role of northern peatlands in the carbon balance of the Northern Hemisphere.
   Location The terrestrial Northern Hemisphere (>30 degrees N).
   Time period 1861-2099.
   Major taxa studied Not a specific plant species, but a plant functional type is used by the model to represent an average of all vegetation growing in northern peatlands.
   Methods The ORCHIDEE-PEAT v.2.0 process-based land surface model was used to simulate area and carbon dynamics of northern peatlands. The model was driven up to the year 2099 by the global CO2 concentration from representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5 by corresponding climate projections from two general circulation models after bias correction.
   Results First, from 1861 to 2005 the mean annual carbon balance of northern peatlands was an atmospheric CO2 sink of 0.10 PgC/year, and this sink will roughly double in the future under both RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, whereas the total northern peatlands will be either a source of CO2 (IPSL-CM5A-LR) or near neutral (GFDL-ESM2M) by the end of the century under RCP8.5. Second, the peatlands in western Canada, western and northern Europe may experience reducing areas and may shift from being CO2 sinks to sources, especially under rapid climate warming. Third, peatland enhances soil carbon accumulation in the Northern Hemisphere (lands north of 30 degrees N).
   Main conclusions In this study, future changes in both northern peatland extent and peatland carbon storage are simulated. We highlight that undisturbed northern peatlands are small but persistent carbon sinks in the future; thus, it is important to protect these ecosystems.

AB Arctic peatlands are an important part of the global carbon cycle, accumulating atmospheric carbon as organic matter since the Late glacial. Current methods for understanding the changing efficiency of the peatland carbon sink rely on peatlands with an undisturbed stratigraphy. Here we present a method of estimating primary carbon accumulation rate from a site where permafrost processes have either vertically or horizontally translocated nearby carbon-rich sediment out of stratigraphic order. Briefly, our new algorithm estimates the probability of the age of deposition of a random increment of sediment in the core. The method assumes that if sediment age is measured at even depth increments, dates are more likely to occur during intervals of higher accumulation rate and vice versa. Multiplying estimated sedimentation rate by measured carbon density yields carbon accumulation rate. We perform this analysis at the Imnavait Creek Peatland, near the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research network site at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Using classical radiocarbon age modeling, we find unreasonably high rates of carbon accumulation at various Holocene intervals. With our new method, we find accumulation rate changes that are in improved agreement within the context of other sites throughout Alaska and the rest of the Circum-Arctic region.

AB Natural peatlands are important carbon sinks and sources of methane (CH4). In contrast, drained peatlands turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source and potentially emit nitrous oxide (N2O). Rewetting of peatlands thus potentially implies climate change mitigation. However, data about the time span that is needed for the re-establishment of the carbon sink function by restoration are scarce. We therefore investigated the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) balances of three differently vegetated sites of a bog ecosystem 30 years after rewetting. All three vegetation communities turned out to be sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) ranging between 0.6 +/-1.43 tCO(2) ha(-2) yr(-1) (Sphagnum-dominated vegetation) and 3.09 +/- 3.86 tCO(2) ha(-2) yr(-1) (vegetation dominated by heath). While accounting for the different global warming potential (GWP) of CO2, CH4 and N2O, the annual GHG balance was calculated. Emissions ranged between 25 and 53 tCO(2)-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) and were dominated by large emissions of CH4 (22-51 tCO(2)-eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), with highest rates found at purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) stands. These are to our knowledge the highest CH4 emissions so far reported for bog ecosystems in temperate Europe. As the restored area was subject to large fluctuations in the water table, we assume that the high CH4 emission rates were caused by a combination of both the temporal inundation of the easily decomposable plant litter of purple moor grass and the plant-mediated transport through its tissues. In addition, as a result of the land use history, mixed soil material due to peat extraction and refilling can serve as an explanation. With regards to the long time span passed since rewetting, we note that the initial increase in CH4 emissions due to rewetting as described in the literature is not inevitably limited to a short-term period.

AB Interpolar methane gradient (IPG) data from ice cores suggest the "switching on" of a major Northern Hemisphere methane source in the early Holocene. Extensive data from Russia's West Siberian Lowland show (i) explosive, widespread peatland establishment between 11.5 and 9 thousand years ago, predating comparable development in North America and synchronous with increased atmospheric methane concentrations and IPGs, (ii) larger carbon stocks than previously thought (70.2 Petagrams, up to similar to 26% of all terrestrial carbon accumulated since the Last Glacial Maximum), and (iii) little evidence for catastrophic oxidation, suggesting the region represents a long-term carbon dioxide sink and global methane source since the early Holocene.

AB The major process that reduces nitrate levels in soils and water is denitrification, which converts nitrate and nitrite into gaseous forms of nitrogen, which are then released into the atmosphere. This study used membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) to investigate denitrification in river water bacterial isolates supplied with nitrate and succinate as an energy source as well as in the total population by provision of different carbon compounds to untreated river water samples. Substantial variation was observed in the gases detected with nitrogen, nitrous oxide and nitric oxide all being produced by one or more of the isolates. The indigenous river population as a whole was found to respond very differently to the addition of different carbon sources. Peak nitrogen levels differed by nearly 1 mmol l(-1) and nitrous oxide by approximately 0.5 mmol l(-1) depending on which carbon source was supplied. Nitric oxide was only detected when glycerol was supplied as the carbon source. These results demonstrate the complex interactions involved in nitrogen cycling and suggest that with careful management it may be possible to stimulate particular consortia of micro-organisms to reduce more nitrate to harmless nitrogen rather than nitrous oxide, a known greenhouse gas.

AB Abstract
   Understanding the effects of warming on greenhouse gas feedbacks to climate change represents a major global challenge. Most research has focused on direct effects of warming, without considering how concurrent changes in plant communities may alter such effects. Here, we combined vegetation manipulations with warming to investigate their interactive effects on greenhouse gas emissions from peatland. We found that although warming consistently increased respiration, the effect on net ecosystem CO2 exchange depended on vegetation composition. The greatest increase in CO2 sink strength after warming was when shrubs were present, and the greatest decrease when graminoids were present. CH4 was more strongly controlled by vegetation composition than by warming, with largest emissions from graminoid communities. Our results show that plant community composition is a significant modulator of greenhouse gas emissions and their response to warming, and suggest that vegetation change could alter peatland carbon sink strength under future climate change.

AB The Zoige wetland ecosystem of the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is the largest plateau peat bog worldwide and an important biodiversity conservation centre in China. Nevertheless, limited information is available about this Alpine wetland aquatic ecosystem, including its food-web structure and complexity. In this study, we analysed the trophic interactions among dominant organisms in the food web of this Alpine wetland aquatic ecosystem and assessed the importance of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon sources during the wet season using delta C-13 and delta N-15 analysis. The results supported the hypothesis that the food web of the Zoige Alpine wetland is largely maintained by allochthonous carbon sources rather than autochthonous food sources during the wet season when the allochthonous resource availability is relatively high. The food web contains approximately three trophic levels, and Schizopygopsis pylzovi (a genus of cyprinid fish) is the top predator. Intermediate trophic positions, including zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, represent the primary animal community in the food web. The allochthonous carbon sources are transferred to the food web via these macroinvertebrates (e.g., Ecdyonurus sp. and Sigara substriata). Although our findings show a low biodiversity in the Zoige wetland during the wet season, the trophic redundancy in the food-web structure could support the stability of the Zoige Alpine wetland aquatic ecosystem.

AB We studied the carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from early June to mid-September 2001 in the Russian tundra of northeast Europe. Gas fluxes were measured with chamber techniques to determine the seasonal (100 days) carbon gas balance for terrestrial ecosystems representing various vegetation types. Also, the gas balance for aquatic ecosystems in the region was measured. The 2001 fluxes were compared to colder and wetter season fluxes from 1999. The Sphagnum sp. dominated peat plateau fen and Carex sp. and Sphagnum sp. dominated intermediate flarks were carbon sinks of 106 and 110 g C m(-2), respectively. In addition, methane emissions were highest from these sites. Other terrestrial surfaces lost carbon to the atmosphere (28-118 g C m(-2)). The thermokarst lake and the river had seasonal carbon losses of 15 and 34 g C m(-2), respectively. For areal integration, the distributions of the various functional surfaces were classified based on Landsat TM satellite image and on-site validation. This data was used to integrate the carbon fluxes for the entire Lek Vorkuta catchment. The upscaling indicated that the catchment (114 km(2)) lost 4 (+/-3.5) Gg C to the atmosphere in summer 2001. The results suggest that predicted warming in the tundra region would induce a substantial loss of carbon. In the warm summer of 2001, the carbon gas released from the whole northeast European tundra ( area 205,000 km 2) was 8 Tg C when calculated from the Lek Vorkuta data.

AB Reflooding formerly drained peatlands has been proposed as a means to reduce losses of organic matter and sequester soil carbon for climate change mitigation, but a renewal of high methane emissions has been reported for these ecosystems, offsetting mitigation potential. Our ability to interpret observed methane fluxes in reflooded peatlands and make predictions about future flux trends is limited due to a lack of detailed studies of methanogenic processes. In this study we investigate methanogenesis in a reflooded agricultural peatland in the Sacramento Delta, California. We use the stable-and radio-carbon isotopic signatures of wetland sediment methane, ecosystem-scale eddy covariance flux observations, and laboratory incubation experiments, to identify which carbon sources and methanogenic production pathways fuel methanogenesis and how these processes are affected by vegetation and seasonality. We found that the old peat contribution to annual methane emissions was large (~30%) compared to intact wetlands, indicating a biogeochemical legacy of drainage. However, fresh carbon and the acetoclastic pathway still accounted for the majority of methanogenesis throughout the year. Although temperature sensitivities for bulk peat methanogenesis were similar between open-water (Q(10) = 2.1) and vegetated (Q(10) = 2.3) soils, methane production from both fresh and old carbon sources showed pronounced seasonality in vegetated zones. We conclude that high methane emissions in restored wetlands constitute a biogeochemical trade-off with contemporary carbon uptake, given that methane efflux is fueled primarily by fresh carbon inputs.

DT Article
ID LOST RIVER PEATLAND; NORTHERN MINNESOTA; GROUNDWATER-FLOW; BOG; MIRES;
   FEN
AB NORTHERN peatlands can act as either important sources or sinks for atmospheric carbon(1,2). It is therefore important to understand how carbon cycling in these regions will respond to a changing climate. Existing carbon balance models for peatlands assume that fluid flow and advective mass transport are negligible at depth(3,4), and that the effects of climate change should be essentially limited to the near-surface. Here we report the response of groundwater flow and porewater chemistry in the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands of northern Minnesota to the regional drought cycle. Comparison of held observations and numerical simulations indicates that climate fluctuations of short duration may temporarily reverse the vertical direction of fluid flow through the peat, although this has little effect on water chemistry(5). On the other hand, periods of drought persisting for at least 3-5 years produce striking changes in the chemistry of the pore water. These longer-term changes in hydrology influence the flux of nutrients and dissolved organic matter through the deeper peat, and therefore affect directly the rates of fermentation and methanogenesis, and the export of dissolved carbon compounds from the peatland.

AB The hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) is the most powerful reactive oxygen species that plays a critical role in the fate of redox-active substances. Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems with highly reduced substances and ubiquitous redox interfaces. However, little is known about the production of center dot OH during the reoxidation of peatlands under waterlogged conditions. Here, we conduct a set of reoxidation experiments using waterlogged peat soil dominated by various vegetation species and monitored center dot OH production. The results show that the cumulative concentrations of center dot OH produced within 24 h upon oxygenation of waterlogged peat samples are 307-840 mmol g(-1). The main factors affecting the production of center dot OH include an acidic environment, abundant reduced dissolved organic matter and Fe(II). In addition, center dot OH production enhances laccase activity (the largest class of phenol oxidases in the soil) by 7.7% similar to 20.4% and increases soil respiration by 3.17% similar to 23.67% during the reoxidation of the waterlogged peat samples. In addition, the simulation experiments confirm that center dot OH can promote laccase activity directly by serving as an electron acceptor and indirectly by oxidizing substrates. Both mechanisms are greater than the effect of oxygen (O-2) alone on laccase activity. Our results indicate a new induction mechanism for enhancing laccase activity by center dot OH when subjected to anoxic-oxic interface fluctuations, which is particularly important for carbon cycling in peatlands because it can break the decomposition latch and can further promote soil organic carbon mineralization.

AB Microbes are critical in carbon and nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Members of the Verrucomicrobia are ubiquitous in such systems, and yet their roles and ecophysiology are not well understood. In this study, we recovered 19 Verrucomicrobia draft genomes by sequencing 184 time-series metagenomes from a eutrophic lake and a humic bog that differ in carbon source and nutrient availabilities. These genomes span four of the seven previously defined Verrucomicrobia subdivisions and greatly expand knowledge of the genomic diversity of freshwater Verrucomicrobia. Genome analysis revealed their potential role as (poly) saccharide degraders in freshwater, uncovered interesting genomic features for this lifestyle, and suggested their adaptation to nutrient availabilities in their environments. Verrucomicrobia populations differ significantly between the two lakes in glycoside hydrolase gene abundance and functional profiles, reflecting the autochthonous and terrestrially derived allochthonous carbon sources of the two ecosystems, respectively. Interestingly, a number of genomes recovered from the bog contained gene clusters that potentially encode a novel porin-multiheme cytochrome c complex and might be involved in extracellular electron transfer in the anoxic humus-rich environment. Notably, most epilimnion genomes have large numbers of so-called "Planctomycete-specific" cytochrome c-encoding genes, which exhibited distribution patterns nearly opposite to those seen with glycoside hydrolase genes, probably associated with the different levels of environmental oxygen availability and carbohydrate complexity between lakes/layers. Overall, the recovered genomes represent a major step toward understanding the role, ecophysiology, and distribution of Verrucomicrobia in freshwater.
   IMPORTANCE Freshwater Verrucomicrobia spp. are cosmopolitan in lakes and rivers, and yet their roles and ecophysiology are not well understood, as cultured freshwater Verrucomicrobia spp. are restricted to one subdivision of this phylum. Here, we greatly expanded the known genomic diversity of this freshwater lineage by recovering 19 Verrucomicrobia draft genomes from 184 metagenomes collected from a eutrophic lake and a humic bog across multiple years. Most of these genomes represent the first freshwater representatives of several Verrucomicrobia subdivisions. Genomic analysis revealed Verrucomicrobia to be potential (poly) saccharide degraders and suggested their adaptation to carbon sources of different origins in the two contrasting ecosystems. We identified putative extracellular electron transfer genes and so-called " Planctomycete-specific" cytochrome c-encoding genes and identified their distinct distribution patterns between the lakes/layers. Overall, our analysis greatly advances the understanding of the function, ecophysiology, and distribution of freshwater Verrucomicrobia, while highlighting their potential role in freshwater carbon cycling.

AB Northern peatlands store nearly one-third of terrestrial carbon (C) stocks while covering only 3% of the global landmass; nevertheless, the drivers of C cycling in these often-waterlogged ecosystems are different from those that control C dynamics in upland forested soils. To explore how multiple abiotic and biotic characteristics of bogs interact to shape microbial activity in a northern, forested bog, we added a labile C tracer (C-13-labeled starch) to in situ peat mesocosms and correlated heterotrophic respiration with natural variation in several microbial predictor variables, such as enzyme activity and microbial biomass, as well as with a suite of abiotic variables and proximity to vascular plants aboveground. We found that peat moisture content was positively correlated with respiration and microbial activity, even when moisture levels exceeded total saturation, suggesting that access to organic matter substrates in drier environments may be limiting for microbial activity. Proximity to black spruce trees decreased total and labile heterotrophic respiration. This negative relationship may reflect the influence of tree evapotranspiration and peat shading effects; i.e., microbial activity may decline as peat dries and cools near trees. Here, we isolated the response of heterotrophic respiration to explore the variation in, and interactions among, multiple abiotic and biotic drivers that influence microbial activity. This approach allowed us to reveal the relative influence of individual drivers on C respiration in these globally important C sinks.

AB Paleoecological records suggest that growing season length and/or cloudiness may affect peatland carbon accumulation and testate amoeba-based environmental reconstructions, highlighting a need to understand how light intensity affects microbial communities. We shaded plots on two peatlands for two years to examine effects on testate amoeba communities, the relative abundance of mixotrophic and heterotrophic testate amoebae, transfer-function performance, and delta C-13 values of two species of mixotrophic testate amoebae. Surprisingly, relative abundance of mixotrophic species increased in shade, although compositional changes did not affect transfer-function performance. Shading did not affect delta C-13 values of Hyalosphenia papilio and Heleopera sphagni, which ranged from -23.5 to -19.6%o and -23.2 to -19.2%o, respectively. These delta C-13 values were higher than those of potential food sources and lower than literature-derived values for Chlorella, the zoochlorellae inhabiting mixotrophic testate amoebae. delta C-13 values thus suggest that these mixotrophic species obtain some carbon from Chiorella, although coupled dietary and isotope studies are needed to quantify this contribution. More research is needed to assess impacts of light variability on peatland microbial communities; however, carbon sources are recorded by delta C-13 values of testate amoebae, indicating potential for studies of carbon cycling and how mixotrophy varies temporally and spatially.

AB This study, providing basic and valuable information on nutritional and environmental requirements of Tricholoma terreum, was carried out between 2005 and 2008 to determine the most suitable medium and culture conditions such as temperature, pH, carbon and nitrogen sources for good mycelium growth. Different inoculum media containing peat and peat:vermiculite mixtures (1:4, 1:6, 1:8 and 1:10 v:v) were also investigated for vegetative inoculum production. The effects of potato dextrose agar, biotin aneurin folic acid agar, malt extract agar, modified Melin-Norkrans agar and modified M40 culture media on mycelial growth of T. terreum were found not to be significant. The best temperature and pH values for the mycelial growth were 25 degrees C and 4.5-6.0, respectively. All carbon sources except for sucrose having statistically significant effects on mycelium growth gave the best results in terms of mycelial growth. Malt extract, peptone and yeast extract were the most suitable nitrogen sources. The poorest mycelial growth was recorded in sucrose as a carbon source, and NH4NO3 and (NH4)(2)HPO4 as nitrogen sources. Among vegetative inoculum media, the best mycelial growth was found in 1:4 and 1:6 (v:v) peat:vermiculite mixtures.

AB Prescribed burning is a common land management technique in many areas of the UK uplands. However, concern has been expressed at the impact of this management practice on carbon stocks and fluxes found in the carbon-rich peat soils that underlie many of these areas. This study measured both carbon stocks and carbon fluxes from a chronosequence of prescribed burn sites in northern England. A range of carbon parameters were measured including above ground biomass and carbon stocks; net ecosystem exchange (NEE), net ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and photosynthesis (P-g) from closed chamber methods; and particulate organic carbon (POC). Analysis of the CO2 data showed that burning was a significant factor in measured CO2 readings but that other factors such as month of sampling explained a greater proportion of the variation in the data. Carbon budget results showed that whereas all the plots were net sources of carbon, the most recent burn scars were smaller sources of carbon compared with the older burn scars, suggesting that burning of Calluna-dominated landscapes leads to an avoided loss' of carbon. However, this management intervention did not lead to a transition to a carbon sink and that for carbon purposes, active peat-forming conditions are desirable.

AB The boreal ecosystem is an important global reservoir of stored carbon and a haven for diverse biological communities. The natural disturbance dynamics there have historically been driven by fire and insects, with human-mediated disturbances increasing faster than in other biomes globally. Previous research on the total boreal carbon stock and predictions of its future flux reveal high uncertainty in regional patterns. We reviewed and standardised this extensive body of quantitative literature to provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive estimates of the global carbon balance in the boreal forest. We also compiled century-scale predictions of the carbon budget flux. Our review and standardisation confirmed high uncertainty in the available data, but there is evidence that the region's total carbon stock has been underestimated. We found a total carbon store of 3673 to 1715.8 Pg (10(15) g), the mid-point of which (1095 Pg) is between 13 and 3.8 times larger than any previous mean estimates. Most boreal carbon resides in its soils and peatlands, although estimates are highly uncertain. We found evidence that the region might become a net carbon source following a reduction in carbon uptake rate from at least the 1980s. Given that the boreal potentially constitutes the largest terrestrial carbon source in the world, in one of the most rapidly warming parts of the globe (Walsh, 2014), how we manage these stocks will be influential on future climate dynamics.

Radiocarbon (C-14) analysis/dating provides unique information on the source and rate that carbon is cycled through ecosystems, as has recently been demonstrated at the air-water interface through analysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) lost from peatland streams by evasion (degassing). Peatland streams also have the potential to release large amounts of methane (CH4) and, though C-14 analysis of CH4 emitted by ebullition (bubbling) has been previously reported, diffusive emissions have not. We describe methods that enable the C-14 analysis of CH4 evaded from peatland streams. Using these methods, we investigated the C-14 age and stable carbon isotope composition of both CH4 and CO2 evaded from a small peatland stream draining a temperate raised mire. Methane was aged between 1617 and 1987 years BP, and was much older than CO2 which had an age range of 303-521 years BP. Isotope mass balance modelling of the results indicated that the CO2 and CH4 evaded from the stream were derived from different source areas, with most evaded CO2 originating from younger layers located nearer the peat surface compared to CH4. The study demonstrates the insight that can be gained into peatland carbon cycling from a methodological development which enables dual isotope (C-14 and C-13) analysis of both CH4 and CO2 collected at the same time and in the same way.

AB Vast stores of millennial-aged soil carbon (MSC) in permafrost peatlands risk leaching into the contemporary carbon cycle after thaw caused by climate warming or increased wildfire activity. Here we tracked the export and downstream fate of MSC from two peatland-dominated catchments in subarctic Canada, one of which was recently affected by wildlife. We tested whether thermokarst bog expansion and deepening of seasonally thawed soils due to wildfire increased the contributions of MSC to downstream waters. Despite being available for lateral transport, MSC accounted for <= 6% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pools at catchment outlets. Assimilation of MSC into the aquatic food web could not explain its absence at the outlets. Using delta C-13-Delta C-14-delta N-15-delta H-2 measurements, we estimated only 7% of consumer biomass came from MSC by direct assimilation and algal recycling of heterotrophic respiration. Recent wildfire that caused seasonally thawed soils to reach twice as deep in one catchment did not change these results. In contrast to many other Arctic ecosystems undergoing climate warming, we suggest waterlogged peatlands will protect against downstream delivery and transformation of MSC after climate- and wildfire-induced permafrost thaw.

AB Context Habitat fragmentation is known to be one of the leading causes of species extinctions, however few studies have explored how habitat fragmentation impacts ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling, especially in wetland ecosystems. Objectives We aimed to determine how habitat fragmentation, defined by habitat area and distance from habitat edge, impacts the above-ground carbon cycling and nutrient stoichiometry of a foundation species in a coastal salt marsh. Methods We conducted our research in a salt marsh in the Mid-Atlantic United States, where the foundation grass speciesSpartina patensis being replaced by a more flood-tolerant grass, leading to highly fragmented habitat patches. We quantified decomposition rates, live biomass, and litter accumulation ofS. patensat patch edges and interiors. Additionally, we measured relevant characteristics (e.g., habitat area, elevation, microclimate) ofS. patenspatches. Results Habitat edge effects, and not habitat area effects, had distinct impacts on ecosystem functioning. Habitat edges had less litter accumulation, faster decomposition rates, a warmer and drier microclimate, and lower elevations than patch interiors. Patches with low elevation edges had the fastest decomposition rates, while interiors of patches at any elevation had the slowest decomposition rates. Notably, these impacts were not driven by changes in primary production. Conclusion Habitat fragmentation impacts the above-ground carbon cycling ofS. patensin coastal wetlands by altering litter decomposition, but not primary production, through habitat edge effects. Future research should investigate whether this pattern scales across broader landscapes and if it is observable in other wetland ecosystems.

AB Humans utilise about 40% of the earth's net primary production (NPP) but the products of this NPP are often managed by different sectors, with timber and forest products managed by the forestry sector and food and fibre products from croplands and grasslands managed by the agricultural sector. Other significant anthropogenic impacts on the global carbon cycle include human utilization of fossil fuels and impacts on less intensively managed systems such as peatlands, wetlands and permafrost. A great deal of knowledge, expertise and data is available within each sector. We describe the contribution of sectoral carbon budgets to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Whilst many sectors exhibit similarities for carbon budgeting, some key differences arise due to differences in goods and services provided, ecology, management practices used, land-management personnel responsible, policies affecting land management, data types and availability, and the drivers of change. We review the methods and data sources available for assessing sectoral carbon budgets, and describe some of key data limitations and uncertainties for each sector in different regions of the world. We identify the main gaps in our knowledge/data, show that coverage is better for the developed world for most sectors, and suggest how sectoral carbon budgets could be improved in the future. Research priorities include the development of shared protocols through site networks, a move to full carbon accounting within sectors, and the assessment of full greenhouse gas budgets.

AB Peat soils represent a highly significant carbon store and are usually assumed to serve as net sinks within carbon budgets for climate modelling. However, marked increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in upland peat drainage waters over the past few decades are widespread in England. This suggests that the assumed sink status of some upland peats could be changing, although, as these observations are seldom quantified into actual carbon flux measurements, their overall importance is difficult to gauge. We investigated the fluvial export of the humic component of DOC (hDOC) from 3 South Pennine catchments and found that the actual carbon export via this pathway has doubled over the last 3 decades. Temperature increases to date appear poorly related to this change. Declining sulphur deposition was more strongly related (inversely), but was not a significant determinant in any of the catchments. The major driver for elevated hDOC export appears to be changes in local land management, namely the extensive use of burning for grouse moor management. Substitution of increased hDOC export into published carbon budget models for upland peat environments imply the study sites have shifted from carbon sinks to net sources over the examined period. This suggests that moorland burning, where undertaken on blanket peat, is incompatible with the ecosystem services these landscapes are presumed to provide and that ideas about the role of upland peat moorland in regional and national carbon cycling need reappraisal.

AB The carbon (C) balance of boreal peatlands is mainly the sum of three different C fluxes: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). lntra- and inter-annual dynamics of these fluxes are differentially controlled by similar factors, such as temperature and water-table. Different climatic conditions within and between years might thus result in varying absolute and relative contributions of each flux to net ecosystem productivity (NEP). In this study CO2 fluxes were measured at a boreal peatland in eastern Finland during a dry year (2006) and a wet year (2007) and combined with DOC and CH4 fluxes from the same site. CO2 uptake in the wet year was 65% higher than in the dry year, caused by higher water table (WT) and subsequently reduced rates of soil respiration. Two to three-fold increases in DOC and CH4 fluxes in the wet year did not completely offset the higher CO2 uptake in that year, resulting in NEP of -83.7 +/- 14 g C M-2 in the dry and 134.5 +/- 21 g C 111(-2) in the wet year. Thus, in our study, WT was identified as the most important factor responsible for variations in the C balance between the observed years. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB Historically, northern peatlands have functioned as a carbon sink, sequestering large amounts of soil organic carbon, mainly due to low decomposition in cold, largely waterlogged soils(1,2). The water table, an essential determinant of soil-organic-carbon dynamics(3-10), interacts with soil organic carbon. Because of the high water-holding capacity of peat and its low hydraulic conductivity, accumulation of soil organic carbon raises the water table, which lowers decomposition rates of soil organic carbon in a positive feedback loop. This two-way interaction between hydrology and biogeochemistry has been noted(3,5-8), but is not reproduced in process-based simulations(9). Here we present simulations with a coupled physical-biogeochemical soil model with peat depths that are continuously updated from the dynamic balance of soil organic carbon. Our model reproduces dynamics of shallow and deep peatlands in northern Manitoba, Canada, on both short and longer timescales. We find that the feedback between the water table and peat depth increases the sensitivity of peat decomposition to temperature, and intensifies the loss of soil organic carbon in a changing climate. In our long-term simulation, an experimental warming of 4 degrees C causes a 40% loss of soil organic carbon from the shallow peat and 86% from the deep peat. We conclude that peatlands will quickly respond to the expected warming in this century by losing labile soil organic carbon during dry periods.

AB Peatlands play an important role in global carbon cycling, but their responses to long-term anthropogenically changed hydrologic conditions and nutrient infiltration are not well known. While experimental manipulation studies, e.g., fertilization or water table manipulations, exist on the plot scale, only few studies have addressed such factors under in situ conditions. Therefore, an ecological gradient from the center to the periphery of a continental Canadian peatland bordering a eutrophic water reservoir, as reflected by increasing nutrient input, enhanced water level fluctuations, and increasing coverage of vascular plants, was used for a case study of carbon cycling along a sequence of four differently altered sites. We monitored carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) surface fluxes and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 concentrations in peat profiles from April 2014 through September 2015. Moreover, we studied bulk peat and pore-water quality and we applied delta C-13-CH4 and delta C-13-CO2 stable isotope abundance analyses to examine dominant CH4 production and emission pathways during the growing season of 2015. We observed differential responses of carbon cycling at the four sites, presumably driven by abundances of plant functional types and vicinity to the reservoir. A shrub-dominated site in close vicinity to the reservoir was a comparably weak sink for CO2 (in 1.5 years: -1093 +/- 794, in 1 year: +135 +/- 281 g CO2 m(-2); a net release) as compared to two graminoid-moss-dominated sites and a moss-dominated site (in 1.5 years: -1552 to -2260 g CO2 m(-2), in 1 year: -896 to -1282 g CO2 m(-2)). Also, the shrub-dominated site featured notably low DIC pore-water concentrations and comparably C-13-enriched CH4 (delta C-13-CH4: -57.81 +/- 7.03 parts per thousand) and depleted CO2 (delta C-13-CO2: -15.85 +/- 3.61 parts per thousand) in a more decomposed peat, suggesting a higher share of CH4 oxidation and differences in predominant methanogenic pathways. In comparison to all other sites, the graminoid-moss-dominated site in closer vicinity to the reservoir featured a similar to 30% higher CH4 emission (in 1.5 years: +61.4 +/- 32, in 1 year: +39.86 +/- 16.81 g CH4 m(-2)). Low delta C-13-CH4 signatures (-62.30 +/- 5.54 parts per thousand) indicated only low mitigation of CH4 emissions by methanotrophic activity here. Pathways of methanogenesis and methanotrophy appeared to be related to the vicinity to the water reservoir: the importance of acetoclastic CH4 production apparently increased toward the reservoir, whereas the importance of CH4 oxidation increased toward the peatland center. Plant-mediated transport was the prevailing CH4 emission pathway at all sites even where graminoids were rare. Our study thus illustrates accelerated carbon cycling in a strongly altered peatland with consequences for CO2 and CH4 budgets. However, our results suggest that long-term excess nutrient input does not necessarily lead to a loss of the peatland carbon sink function.

AB Background: Carbon storage potential has become an important consideration for land management and planning in the United States. The ability to assess ecosystem carbon balance can help land managers understand the benefits and tradeoffs between different management strategies. This paper demonstrates an application of the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) model developed for local-scale land management at the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. We estimate the net ecosystem carbon balance by considering past ecosystem disturbances resulting from storm damage, fire, and land management actions including hydrologic inundation, vegetation clearing, and replanting.
   Results: We modeled the annual ecosystem carbon stock and flow rates for the 30-year historic time period of 1985-2015, using age-structured forest growth curves and known data for disturbance events and management activities. The 30-year total net ecosystem production was estimated to be a net sink of 0.97 Tg C. When a hurricane and six historic fire events were considered in the simulation, the Great Dismal Swamp became a net source of 0.89 Tg C. The cumulative above and below-ground carbon loss estimated from the South One and Lateral West fire events totaled 1.70 Tg C, while management activities removed an additional 0.01 Tg C. The carbon loss in below-ground biomass alone totaled 1.38 Tg C, with the balance (0.31 Tg C) coming from above-ground biomass and detritus.
   Conclusions: Natural disturbances substantially impact net ecosystem carbon balance in the Great Dismal Swamp. Through alternative management actions such as re-wetting, below-ground biomass loss may have been avoided, resulting in the added carbon storage capacity of 1.38 Tg. Based on two model assumptions used to simulate the peat system, (a burn scar totaling 70 cm in depth, and the soil carbon accumulation rate of 0.36 t C/ha(-1)/year(-1) for Atlantic white cedar), the total soil carbon loss from the South One and Lateral West fires would take approximately 1740 years to re-amass. Due to the impractical time horizon this presents for land managers, this particular loss is considered permanent. Going forward, the baseline carbon stock and flow parameters presented here will be used as reference conditions to model future scenarios of land management and disturbance.

AB The Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) is a global hot-spot for carbon cycling and export. Yet the influence of microorganisms on carbon cycling processes in PCTR soil is poorly characterized. We developed and tested a conceptual model of seasonal microbial carbon cycling in PCTR soil through integration of geochemistry, micro-meteorology, and eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomal amplicon (rRNA) sequencing from 216 soil DNA and RNA libraries. Soil moisture and pH increased during the wet season, with significant correlation to net CO2 flux in peat bog and net CH4 flux in bog forest soil. Fungal succession in these sites was characterized by the apparent turnover of Archaeorhizomycetes phylotypes accounting for 41% of ITS libraries. Anaerobic prokaryotes, including Syntrophobacteraceae and Methanomicrobia increased in rRNA libraries during the wet season. Putatively active populations of these phylotypes and their biogeochemical marker genes for sulfate and CH4 cycling, respectively, were positively correlated following rRNA and metatranscriptomic network analysis. The latter phylotype was positively correlated to CH4 fluxes (r = 0.46, p < 0.0001). Phylotype functional assignments were supported by metatranscriptomic analysis. We propose that active microbial populations respond primarily to changes in hydrology, pH, and nutrient availability. The increased microbial carbon export observed over winter may have ramifications for climate-soil feedbacks in the PCTR.

AB Peatlands, soils and the ocean floor are well-recognized as sites of organic carbonaccumulation andrepresentimportant global carbon sinks(1,2). Although the annual burial of organic carbon in lakes and reservoirs exceeds that of ocean sediments(3), these inland waters are components of the global carbon cycle that receive only limited attention(4-6). Of the organic carbon that is being deposited onto the sediments, a certain proportion will be mineralized and the remainder will be buried over geological timescales. Here we assess the relationship between sediment organic carbon mineralization and temperature in a cross-system survey of boreal lakes in Sweden, and with input froma compilation of published data from awide range of lakes that differ with respect to climate, productivity and organic carbon source. We find that the mineralization of organic carbon in lake sediments exhibits a strongly positive relationship with temperature, which suggests that warmer water temperatures lead to more mineralization and less organic carbon burial. Assuming that future organic carbon delivery to the lake sediments will be similar to that under present-day conditions, we estimate that temperature increases following the latest scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7) could result in a 4-27 per cent (0.9-6.4 Tg Cyr(-1)) decrease in annual organic carbon burial in boreal lakes.

AB Changes in temperature and carbon dioxide during glacial cycles recorded in Antarctic ice cores are tightly coupled. However, this relationship does not hold for interglacials. While climate cooled towards the end of both the last (Eemian) and present (Holocene) interglacials, CO2 remained stable during the Eemian while rising in the Holocene. We identify and review twelve biogeochemical mechanisms of terrestrial (vegetation dynamics and CO2 fertilization, land use, wildfire, accumulation of peat, changes in permafrost carbon, subaerial volcanic outgassing) and marine origin (changes in sea surface temperature, carbonate compensation to deglaciation and terrestrial biosphere regrowth, shallow-water carbonate sedimentation, changes in the soft tissue pump, and methane hydrates), which potentially may have contributed to the CO2 dynamics during interglacials but which remain not well quantified. We use three Earth System Models (ESMs) of intermediate complexity to compare effects of selected mechanisms on the interglacial CO2 and delta(CO2)-C-13 changes, focusing on those with substantial potential impacts: namely carbonate sedimentation in shallow waters, peat growth, and (in the case of the Holocene) human land use. A set of specified carbon cycle forcings could qualitatively explain atmospheric CO2 dynamics from 8 ka BP to the pre-industrial. However, when applied to Eemian boundary conditions from 126 to 115 ka BP, the same set of forcings led to disagreement with the observed direction of CO2 changes after 122 ka BP. This failure to simulate late-Eemian CO2 dynamics could be a result of the imposed forcings such as prescribed CaCO3 accumulation and/or an incorrect response of simulated terrestrial carbon to the surface cooling at the end of the interglacial. These experiments also reveal that key natural processes of interglacial CO2 dynamics - shallow water CaCO3 accumulation, peat and permafrost carbon dynamics are not well represented in the current ESMs. Global-scale modeling of these long-term carbon cycle components started only in the last decade, and uncertainty in parameterization of these mechanisms is a main limitation in the successful modeling of interglacial CO2 dynamics.

AB Northern peatlands have been accumulating organic matter since the start of the Holocene, and are now a substantial store of terrestrial carbon. However, their current status as carbon sinks is less clear, because of the possible effects of climate change, air pollution, grazing and drainage etc., and the difficulties of accurate measurement with suitable time resolution. Such measurements are particularly lacking in the UK. Here, we present multi-year eddy covariance measurements of the carbon fluxes at a relatively undisturbed ombrotrophic blanket bog in the Flow Country of northern Scotland. The site consistently acted as a moderate sink for CO2 over all the measurement years (mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of -114 g C m(-2) y(-1)), similar in magnitude to other measurements in the boreal and tundra zones, and rather higher than the existing measurements at other sites in the UK and Ireland. Generally, the NEE of CO2 was relatively insensitive to moderate inter-annual variations in weather. Non-CO2 losses comprised 11% of gross primary production, mainly from methane emissions. Accounting for these terms, the net ecosystem carbon balance was -50 g C-CO2 eq m(-2) y(-1). The contemporary carbon sink was larger than estimates from local peat cores, based on peat accumulation over the last several thousand years, but in the middle of the range of estimates which used spheroidal carbonaceous particles to estimate peat accumulation rates over the last century.

AB The post-drainage changes in vegetation composition and carbon balance were studied on four site types (from minero- to ombrotrophic conditions) in Lakkasuo mire, central Finland, by directly comparing undrained and drained parts (30 years ago) of the mire. Drainage had drastically changed the species composition of the sites, especially at the minerotrophic sites, where almost all Sphagna had been replaced by forest mosses. On the ombrotrophic sites much of the mire vegetation still remained 30 years after drainage. Drainage had decreased the C stores in ground vegetation on the minerotrophic sites but increased them on the ombrotrophic sites. The changes were, however, very small compared to the changes in the tree stand, where the C stores had increased at all sites (increasing with nutrient level). The change in peat C balance over the 30-year post-drainage period was negative on the most nutrient-rich site, and positive on the others, increasing with lower nutrient levels. The decrease in the peat C balance on the most nutrient-rich site was compensated by the greater increase in the tree stand C stores and the changes in the total C balance (peat+tree stand+ground vegetation) remained positive on all sites.

AB In a future warmer world, peatlands may change from a carbon sink function to a carbon source function. This study tracks changes in water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) after 1 year of in situ experimental warming using open top chambers (OTCs). WEOM was studied in the upper peat layers (0-10 cm) through analysis of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), stable C isotopic composition (delta C-13), specific UV absorbance at 280 nm and sugar composition of cores taken from an open bog (DRY sites) and a transitional poor fen (WET sites). At the DRY sites, the impact of OTCs was weak with respect to WEOM parameters, whereas at the WET sites, the air warming treatment led to a decrease in peat water content, suggesting that the supply of heat by OTCs was used mainly for evapotranspiration. OTCs at the WET sites also induced a relative enrichment at the surface (0-5 cm depth) of aliphatic and/or aromatic compounds with concomitant decrease in WEOC, as a result of decomposition. On the contrary, WEOC and sugar content increased in the deeper peat layer (7.5-10 cm depth) probably as a result of increased leaching of phenolic compounds by roots, which then inhibits microbial activity. The different response to experimental warming at DRY and WET sites suggests that the spatial variability of moisture is critical for understanding of the impact of global warming on the fate of OM and the carbon cycle in peatlands.

AB Effects of physical and chemical states of iron-based catalysts on the formation of carbon-encapsulated iron nanoparticles (CEINs) synthesized thermally from kraft lignin were investigated. Experimental results indicated that if solution-based iron nitrate (FeN) was used as an iron source for the catalyst, CEINs observed were alpha-Fe and gamma-Fe-based cores encapsulated by few layers graphitic-carbon (mostly 1-5 layers) and the majority of these CEINs were embedded in amorphous carbon matrix. The formation of graphitic-carbon shells is believed based on the dissolution and precipitation mechanism of amorphous carbon acting as the carbon source. If solid-based iron nanoparticles (FePs) were used as the catalyst, CEINs observed were alpha-Fe, gamma-Fe, and Fe3C-based cores encapsulated with tangled graphitic-carbon nanoribbons and carbon tubules and the majority of these CEINs were found along the edge of amorphous carbon matrix. The growth of tangled graphitic-carbon nanoribbons and carbon tubules is based on a chemical vapor decomposition process, i.e., the carbonaceous gases from kraft lignin decomposition served as the carbon source.

AB Peatlands in the western boreal plains of Canada are important ecosystems as they store over two percent of global terrestrial carbon. However, in recent decades, many of these peatlands have been fragmented by access roads constructed for resource extraction and transportation, challenging their carbon storage potential. To investigate how roads have been impacting tree and shrub growth and productivity in these peatlands, this study was conducted in a forested bog and woody fen in Carmon Creek, Alberta, Canada. In 2017, vegetation surveys were conducted along 20 m transects that extended on both sides of the road with 4 m(2)circular plots at 2, 6 and 20 m distance from the road and were followed by disc or core collection from woody stems. Within 20 m of the road at the bog site, we observed a shift towards significantly larger radial growth of trees in the downstream areas (t= 3.23,p= 0.006) where water table position was deeper, while at the fen site, radial growth of tall shrubs had little response to the road. Combining the effects of direct tree clearing and hydrology induced shifts in growth, aboveground net primary productivity (NPPag) post-road construction was reduced significantly in areas where vegetation was cleared during the road construction (i.e., upstream areas of the bog:t= 5.21,p< 0.0001 and downstream areas of the fen:t= 2.64,p= 0.07). Substantially lower NPPag around the road construction areas compared to reference areas shows tremendous loss of carbon sink potential of trees and shrubs after road construction through peatlands. Altogether, roads constructed through peatlands perpendicular to the water flow may shift long-term carbon sinks into sources of carbon, at least for the initial few years following road construction.

AB Forest systems cover more than 4.1 x 10(9) hectares of the Earth's land area. Globally, forest vegetation and soils contain about 1146 petagrams of carbon, with approximately 37 percent of this carbon in low-latitude forests, 14 percent in mid-latitudes, and 49 percent at high latitudes. Over two-thirds of the carbon in forest ecosystems is contained in soils and associated peat deposits. In 1990, deforestation in the low latitudes emitted 1.6 +/- 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year, whereas forest area expansion and growth in mid- and high-latitude forest sequestered 0.7 +/- 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year, for a net flux to the atmosphere of 0.9 +/- 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year. Slowing deforestation, combined with an increase in forestation and other management measures to improve forest ecosystem productivity, could conserve or sequester significant quantities of carbon. Future forest carbon cycling trends attributable to losses and regrowth associated with global climate and land-use change are uncertain. Model projections and some results suggest that forests could be carbon sinks or sources in the future.

AB The postglacial development of peatland systems has had a strong influence on the global carbon cycle. Peatland effects on carbon cycling involve changes in both large-scale structure and community composition. The rate of C sequestration declines as a peat deposit grows, and methane emission increases as wet microhabitats expand in area. We examine the theoretical basis, underlying assumptions, and empirical evidence for two highly influential models of peatland form and development: Clymo's bog growth model (BGM) and Ingram's groundwater mound hypothesis (GMH). Our detailed theoretical analysis reveals previously unrecognized consequences of the models and, for the BGM, unrealistically stringent conditions for application. Our review of model assumptions and empirical evidence identifies the principal limitations of these models: they ignore spatial heterogeneity in peatland structure and function, fast processes occurring near the peatland surface, and interactions between peat accumulation and hydrological conditions. As a result, these models are unable to predict the effects of bog growth on hydrological conditions or peat-forming processes.
   We introduce five conceptual models of peatland development that differ in how bog size and shape change over time, and we examine the consequences of each model for hydrological conditions. This exercise shows how bog height growth and lateral expansion change the boundary conditions constraining peatland dynamics, and so determine the direction of ecosystem development. We link peatland properties to the four general properties of ''complex adaptive systems'' (CAS): spatial heterogeneity, localized flows, self-organizing structure and nonlinearity. We also present a framework for modeling peatlands as CAS. In this framework, the system is disaggregated, both vertically and horizontally, into a set of components that interact locally through flows of energy and resources. Both internal dynamics and external forcing drive changes in hydrological conditions and microhabitat pattern, and these autogenic and allogenic changes in peatland structure affect hydrological processes, which, in turn, constrain peatland development and carbon cycling. We conclude by outlining four areas in which further empirical research is urgently needed.

AB Peatlands are the most efficient natural ecosystems for long-term storage of atmospheric carbon. Our understanding of peatland carbon cycling is based entirely on bottom-up controls regulated by low nutrient availability. Recent studies have shown that top-down controls through predator-prey dynamics can influence ecosystem function, yet this has not been evaluated in peatlands to date. Here, we used a combination of nutrient enrichment and trophic-level manipulation to test the hypothesis that interactions between nutrient availability (bottom-up) and predation (top-down) influence peatland carbon fluxes. Elevated nutrients stimulated bacterial biomass and organic matter decomposition. In the absence of top-down regulation, carbon dioxide (CO2) respiration driven by greater decomposition was offset by elevated algal productivity. Herbivores accelerated CO2 emissions by removing algal biomass, while predators indirectly reduced CO2 emissions by muting herbivory in a trophic cascade. This study demonstrates that trophic interactions can mitigate CO2 emissions associated with elevated nutrient levels in northern peatlands.

AB Aims Global change is shown to significantly affect the C storage function of peatlands; however, a majority of previous research is focused on a single environmental stressor such as the increased temperature. As a result, little is known about the interactive effect of multiple environmental stressors on peatland C storage, especially in sedge-dominated fen peatlands. Methods We performed a full factorial experiment of increased temperature and elevated atmospheric CO(2)concentration on minerotrophic, sedge-dominated fen monoliths to experimentally examine the individual and interactive effects of simulated future climate conditions on peatland plant biomass, CO(2)exchange, and pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over one full growing season. Results Our study demonstrates that warming and elevated atmospheric CO(2)significantly increased aboveground and belowground biomass, respectively, as well as the gross ecosystem production (GEP), while the DOC concentrations and respired CO(2)from peatland soils only increased under warming Conclusions Our results suggest that global change will increase both plant production and microbial decomposition, but with altered plant biomass allocation between aboveground and belowground. Our study provides experimental evidence for shifts in ecosystem-level carbon dynamics under global change for a sedge-dominated peatland, and suggests that while carbon stores may weaken, the carbon sink will be maintained in these types of northern peatlands if hydrological conditions are largely maintained.

AB Using data from a single upland peat catchment ( North Pennines, UK), this study combines descriptions of the uptake of carbon by primary productivity and input from both wet and dry deposition with descriptions of carbon release pathways: soil CO2 respiration, CH4 flux, particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and excess dissolved CO2. Each pathway is projected 10 years into the future based upon extrapolated changes in rainfall and temperature. The study shows that the catchment is presently a net source of carbon and that over a period of 10 years the catchment goes from a net source of 11.2 to 20.9 gC/m(2)/year. The probability that the catchment is a net sink of carbon decreases from 35 to 26% over the study period, i.e. upland peats are predicted to become an increasing source of carbon. With respect to carbon gases (CO2 + CH4), the catchment remains a net sink but this decreases from 15.9 to 11.2 gC/m2/year, given current trends the catchment will become a net source of carbon gases by 2034. For most pathways the predicted increases or decreases are in line with increasing temperature predicted for the area, but DOC flux shows a larger percentage increase because of additional production caused by the increased frequency of severe droughts within the catchment. If this result is extended across the UK uplands, peats would be a net source of between 0.26 and 0.45 Mt C/year, but with respect to carbon gases alone the catchment is net sink of between 0.35 and 0.23 Mt C/year.

AB About 30% of the carbon in terrestrial ecosystems is stored in northern wetlands and boreal forest regions. Prevailing cold and wet soil conditions have largely been responsible for this carbon accumulation. It has been suggested that a warmer and drier climate in these regions might increase the decomposition rate and, hence, release more CO2 to the atmosphere than at present. This study reports on the spatial variability and temperature dependence of the potential carbon release after incubating highly organic soils from the European Arctic and Siberia at different temperatures. We found that the decay potential, measured as CO2 production in laboratory experiments, differed strongly within and among sites, particularly at higher soil temperatures. Furthermore, both the decay potential and its temperature response decreased significantly with depth in the soil, presumably because the older soils at deeper layers contained higher proportions of recalcitrant carbon than the younger soil organic matter at the surface. These results have implications for global models of potential feedbacks on climate change inferred from changes in the carbon balance of northern wetlands and tundra. Firstly, because the decay potential of the organic matter varies locally as well as regionally, predictions of how the tundra carbon balance may change will be unreliable if these are based on measurements at a few sites only. Secondly, any increase in CO2 production may be transitional as both the carbon flux and its temperature sensitivity decrease when the most easily degradable organic material near the soil surface has decomposed. Consequently, it is crucial to account for transient responses and regional differences in the models of potential feedbacks on climate change from changed carbon cycling in northern terrestrial ecosystems.

AB With the increase in the drainage and extraction of peat for horticultural, agricultural and energy purposes worldwide, there is an increased pressure to restore hydrological conditions essential to the re-establishment of Sphagnum mosses and, therefore, carbon sequestration. Measurements of ecosystem CO2 were conducted Lit a recently restored vacuum harvested bog in Eastern Quebec, Canada. The peatland was restored by blocking the drainage networks to return optimal water table positions for the growth of Sphagnum mosses and the spreading of a dense straw mulch layer to reduce evaporative losses and stabilize the surface for the moss re-growth. However, the return Of the moss species is a gradual process and previous studies have suggested that initially the carbon loss from the system actually increase as the mulch decomposes. We examined old and new mulch CO2 production in lab incubations and scaled these results to the ecosystem level in order to determine if mulch decomposition is impeding the net carbon sink function of this peatland. At mean growing season temperatures fresh mulch was observed to release 151.5 mumol CO2 g(-1) per day, while older mulch released 145 mumol CO2 g(-1) per day. Furthermore, under moist conditions the CO2 release increased for all mulches. However, contrary to most assumptions, Q(10) values for all mulches decreased with increasing temperatures and were greater for older mulch than for fresh. Thus, in the short term, the application of a surface straw mulch layer can have significant effects on the carbon balance of a restored peatland. Due to the decomposition of this mulch layer over the first several seasons of restoration, the peatland became a larger source of CO2, despite the increase in production of a re-emerging vegetation layer.

AB Boreal peatlands are major sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to downstream aquatic ecosystems, where it influences carbon cycling and food web structure. Wildfire and permafrost thaw alter peatland vegetation and hydrology and may affect the quantity and chemical composition of exported DOC. We studied the influence of wildfire and thaw on microbial and photochemical lability of near-surface porewater DOC, assessed through 7 d incubations. We carried out these incubations in spring, summer, and fall but only found differences in spring when DOC biodegradability (% loss during dark incubations) increased with lower DOC aromaticity and C/N ratios. During spring, the most labile DOC was found in recently formed thermokarst bogs along collapsing peat plateau edges (25% loss), which was greater than in mature sections of thermokarst bogs (3%), and peat plateaus with intact permafrost (9%). Increased DOC lability following thaw was likely linked to high DOC production and turnover associated with productive hydrophilic Sphagnum mosses and sedges, rather than thawed permafrost peat. A wildfire (3 yr prior) reduced DOC biodegradability in both peat plateaus (4%) and rapidly collapsing peat plateau edges (14%). Biodegradability of DOC in summer and fall was low across all sites; 2% and 4%, respectively. Photodegradation was shown to potentially contribute significantly to downstream DOC degradation but did not vary across peatland sites. We show that disturbances such as permafrost thaw and wildfire have the potential to affect downstream carbon cycling, particularly as the largest influences were found in spring when peatlands are well connected to downstream aquatic ecosystems.

AB Boreal and subarctic peatlands comprise a carbon pool of 455 Pg that has accumulated during the postglacial period at an average net rate of 0.096 Pg/yr (1 Pg = 10(15) g).  Using Clymo's (1984) model, the current rate is estimated at 0.076 Pg/yr.  Long-term drainage of these peatlands is estimated to be causing the oxidation to CO2 of a little more than 0.0085 Pg/yr, with combustion of fuel peat adding almost-equal-to 0.026 Pg/yr.  Emissions of CH4 are estimated to release almost-equal-to 0.046 Pg of carbon annually.
   Uncertainties beset estimates of both stocks and fluxes, particularly with regard to Soviet peatlands.  The influence of water table alterations upon fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 is in great need of investigation over a wide range of peatland environments, especially in regions where permafrost melting, thermokarst erosion, and the development of thaw lakes are likely results of climatic warming.  The role of fire in the carbon cycle of peatlands also deserves increased attention.  Finally, satellite-monitoring of the abundance of open water in the peatlands of the West Siberian Plain and the Hudson/James Bay Lowland is suggested as a likely method of detecting early effects of climatic warming upon boreal and subarctic peatlands.

AB In five tributary streams (four inflowing and one outflowing) of 1600-ha Trout Lake in northern Wisconsin, USA, we examined factors that can affect the magnitude of stream flow and transport of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) through the streams to the lake. One catchment, the Allequash Creek basin, was investigated in more detail to describe the dynamics of carbon flow and to identify potential carbon sources. Stream flows and carbon loads showed little or no relation to surface-water catchment area. They were more closely related to ground-water watershed area because ground-water discharge, from both local and regional sources, is a major contributor to the hydrologic budgets of these catchments. An important factor in determining carbon influx to the stream is the area of peatland in the catchment. Peatland porewaters contain DOC concentrations up to 40 mg l(-1) and are a significant potential carbon source. Ground-water discharge and lateral flow through peat are the suspected mechanisms for transport of that carbon to the streams. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes suggested that the sources of DOC in Allequash Creek above Allequash Lake were wetland vegetation and peat and that the sources below Allequash Lake were filamentous algae and wild rice. Catchments with high proportions of peatland, including the Allequash Creek catchment, tended to have elevated DOC loads in outflowing stream water. Respiration and carbon mineralization in lakes within the system tend to produce low DOC and low DOC/DIC in lake outflows, especially at Trout Lake. In Allequash Lake, however, the shallow peat island and vegetation-filled west end were sources of DOC. Despite the vast carbon reservoir in the peatlands, carbon yields were very low in these catchments. Maximum yields were on the order of 2.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DOC and 5.5 g m(-2) y(-1) DIC. The small yields were attributable to low stream flows due to lack of significant overland runoff and very limited stream channel coverage of the total catchment area.

AB Tropical wetlands are not included in Earth system models, despite being an important source of methane (CH4) and contributing a large fraction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry in the tropics. This review identifies a remarkable lack of data on the carbon balance and gas fluxes from undisturbed tropical wetlands, which limits the ability of global change models to make accurate predictions about future climate. We show that the available data on in situ carbon gas fluxes in undisturbed forested tropical wetlands indicate marked spatial and temporal variability in CO2 and CH4 emissions, with exceptionally large fluxes in Southeast Asia and the Neotropics. By upscaling short-term measurements, we calculate that approximately 9077 Tg CH4 year(-1) and 45401480 Tg CO2 year(-1) are released from tropical wetlands globally. CH4 fluxes are greater from mineral than organic soils, whereas CO2 fluxes do not differ between soil types. The high CO2 and CH4 emissions are mirrored by high rates of net primary productivity and litter decay. Net ecosystem productivity was estimated to be greater in peat-forming wetlands than on mineral soils, but the available data are insufficient to construct reliable carbon balances or estimate gas fluxes at regional scales. We conclude that there is an urgent need for systematic data on carbon dynamics in tropical wetlands to provide a robust understanding of how they differ from well-studied northern wetlands and allow incorporation of tropical wetlands into global climate change models.

AB Peatland is a significant ecosystem that has accumulated one-third of the soil carbon in boreal regions. However, the net carbon balance, particularly with current carbon emissions, remains unclear. In this study, the annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from a peatland located in Northeast China are reported. Ecosystem respiration fluxes from the shrub-moss-and Eriophorum-dominated communities in the peatland varied from 12 to 272 mg Cm-2 h(-2) during the snow-free season, and the Eriophorumdominated community emitted more CO2. Rates of ecosystem respiration were strongly regulated by temperature and water table depth. The CH4 fluxes emitted from the peatland throughout a year varied with the type of the vegetation community during the snow-free season. No distinct episodic CH4 efflux during the freeze-thaw cycles was observed from the shrub-moss-dominated community, whereas a subtle pulse of CH4 was found in the Eriophorum-dominated community. The annual ecosystem respiration and CH4 fluxes from the peatland were 356 and 1.51 g Cm-2 per year, respectively. The contributions of CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the snowy season to annual emissions were much lower than those found in other boreal peatlands, whereas 24% of the annual methane flux was emitted during the freeze-thaw cycles. The results highlight the importance of gaseous carbon efflux in the estimation of carbon flux from peatlands, as well as the contribution of carbon efflux during the snow-covered season.

AB Peatlands require soil improvement to be suitable for cultivation. Creating eco-friendly and cost-effective carbon sinks in peatlands originated from peat production has several benefits. For this purpose various valuable biomass can be used by utilizing industrial by-products also as soil conditioners and fertilizers. For example, the addition of such materials has potential to transform peat bogs, which otherwise would slowly release methane, into productive cultivated areas. The rehabilitation of peat bogs from unused land into various agricultural and forestry areas is also a viable business activity. The examined industrial by-products could have many agricultural applications in non-food potato production, wherein monoculture causes problems such as condensed soil, lost humus or soil organic matter, and reduced nutrient retention capacity, leading to increased leaching of nutrients and negative impacts on the environment. Five industrial by-products were examined in this study as soil conditioners and fertilizers: fiber sludge, biocarbon, hygienic biodigestate, paper mill sludge, and gypsum waste. Based on the results of a nutrient content analysis, hygienic biodigestate and fiber sludge were the most effective fertilizers.

AB The ongoing warming in high-latitude regions may be causing rapid changes in the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Of particular concern is the fate of belowground soil organic carbon stored in peat-accumulating wetlands, as these large carbon pools are sensitive to temperature and moisture conditions. Despite their important role in the global carbon cycle, considerable uncertainty remains over the carbon balance of northern peatlands in a changing climate. Here we examine the response of vegetation and carbon dynamics in a wet boreal peatland to recent climate warming using empirical peat core data and a new modeling approach. We observed a widespread shift from herbaceous Carex fen peat to Sphagnum moss peat around 100 years ago that was accompanied by a sharp increase in carbon accumulation rate. The observed apparent carbon accumulation rates over the past 100 years (96.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) were almost 10 times greater than those over the past 4000 years (11.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Once differential decomposition history was considered using three modeling approaches, the expected long-term accumulation rate of recent peat was still 2-6 times greater than that of the past 4000 years. We propose that recent warming has led to Sphagnum establishment, which rapidly altered the peatland surface chemistry and hydrology, further promoting Sphagnum growth and enhancing the carbon sink capacity of this peatland. Longer and warmer growing seasons could also have stimulated plant growth. Our results imply that accelerated carbon accumulation under global warming in some wet peatlands might offset some of the carbon losses experienced from other peatland types.

   WORKSHOP
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
LA English
DT Article
ID OCEAN; MODEL
AB Natural CO2 sinks in terrestrial and marine environments are important components of the global carbon cycle, yet the sign and magnitudes of key fluxes among them are unknown. The results of the Palmas Del Mar Workshop - Natural Sinks of CO2 presented in this special issue and its companion hard-bound volume of Water, Air, & Soil Pollution, provide a synthesis of current research on the carbon cycle, CO2 sinks and associated processes and fluxes, and critical research needs to assess the potential role of forest and land-use management in carbon sequestration. The papers in this volume present data, observations, and model simulations that demonstrate: 1) the existence of natural CO2 sinks that could mitigate a significant amount of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion; 2) probable, human-caused imbalances in C exchanges among vegetation, soils, and the atmosphere; 3) enhanced C storage in vegetation in response to excess atmospheric CO2; 4) strong interactions among carbon, nutrient and hydrological cycles; and 5) an excess of carbon production over consumption in several, large managed forests. Although it appears unlikely that the search for the "missing" C sink required to balance the C budget will end in the open ocean, new estimates of C storage in mangrove wood and peat, suggest that coastal ecosystems have the capacity to store significant amounts of carbon in vegetation and sediments. Convincing analyses are also presented indicating the technical and economical feasibility of managing existing lands to sequester additional carbon. Long-term field studies of CO2 fertilization effects and carbon cycling by plants and soils in geographically important systems, native forests, and coastal ecosystems will go a long way toward meeting the research needs identified at the workshop.

AB Carbon balances were calculated for the summer stratification period of 2001 for the hydroelectric reservoir L. Skinnmuddselet (created in 1989) and the natural L. Ortrasket, and estimated on annual basis for both lakes. The reservoir and the lake have similar chemical characteristics and are located in adjacent catchments in the northern part of Sweden. Our main hypothesis was that the CO2 Production and emissions from the reservoir, L. Skinnmuddselet, would be greater than in the natural L. Ortrasket, due to the decomposition of flooded vegetation and peat.
   The carbon balances showed that the total production Of CO2 per unit lake surface area during the summer was very similar in the natural lake and the reservoir (31.3 g C m(-2) in L. Ortrasket and 25.3 g C m(-2) in L. Skinnmuddselet). The sediments were the major CO2 source in the reservoir, while most of the mineralization in the natural lake occurred in the water column. On annual basis the natural L. Ortrasket produced and emitted more CO2 per unit of lake surface area than the reservoir L. Skinnmuddselet since mineralization proceeded during winter when L. Skinnmuddselet was emptied for electricity production. Therefore, the potential for CO2 emission was not greater in the reservoir than in the natural lake. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland is an important terrestrial carbon reservoir that contains >25% of soil carbon and accounts for 25%-38% of natural methane emissions. Most of this carbon is contained in postglacial boreal peat. Our understanding of the carbon cycle within this reservoir and its links to the atmosphere is therefore restricted to periods of <10 k.y. A record of the longer-term behavior of the peatland carbon reservoir under nonglacial conditions does, however, exist in thick lignite deposits formed over periods of >1 m.y. Spectral analysis of varying lignite color reveals that 120 m of early Miocene lignite from the Gippsland Basin, Australia, contains a 1.7 m.y. record of orbitally paced climate oscillations dominated by the response to obliquity. Use of the regular orbital signal indicates that the average long-term rate of peatland carbon accumulation recorded in the lignite is 27.5 g.m(-2.)yr(-1). This rate is constant over periods of >100 k.y. and is independent of shorter-term, <10 k.y., fluctuations in climate and hydrology. Matching the lignite record to the theoretical insolation curve indicates that the lignite formed between 22.5 and 20.8 Ma. Contemporaneous long-term changes in lignite color and the C-13/C-12 ratios of marine foraminifera may relate to changing peatland methane flux and thus point to a link between terrestrial and marine carbon dynamics.

AB Northern peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle representing a significant stock of soil carbon and a substantial natural source of atmospheric methane (CH(4)). Peatland carbon cycling is affected by water table position which is predicted to be lowered by climate change. Therefore we compared carbon fluxes along a natural peatland microtopographic gradient ( control) to an adjacent microtopographic gradient with an experimentally lowered water table ( experimental) during three growing seasons to assess the impact of water table drawdown on peatland-atmosphere carbon exchange. Water table drawdown induced peat subsidence and a change in the vegetation community at the experimental site. This limited differences in carbon dioxide (CO(2)) exchange between the control and experimental sites resulting in no significant differences between sites after three seasons. However, there was a trend to higher respiration rates and increased productivity in low-lying zones (hollows) and this was coincident with increased vegetation cover at these plots. In general, CH(4) efflux was reduced at the experimental site, although CH(4) efflux from control and experimental hollows remained similar throughout the study. The differential response of carbon cycling to the water table drawdown along the microtopographic gradient resulted in local topographic high zones ( hummocks) experiencing a relative increase in global warming potential (GWP) of 152%, while a 70% reduction in GWP was observed at hollows. Thus the distribution and composition of microtopographic elements, or microforms, within a peatland is important for determining how peatland carbon cycling will respond to climate change.

AB We investigated the treatment efficiency of micro-polluted NO3--dominated river water with low C/N ratio by five parallel pilot-scale IVCWs with different plant and substrate collocation. When the mean concentration was 2.24 and 0.193mgL(-1) in influent, IVCWs achieved an average (mass) removal rate of (0.09gm(-2)day(-1)) 46.8% and (0.77gm(-2)day(-1)) 62.3% for TN and TP, respectively, during 1year of operation. Water quality was significantly improved from grade V to meet the criterion of grade IV of surface water. Through the comparison of removal rate by different IVCWs, we found that lack of carbon sources in influent limited the denitrification in the middle and bottom layers (ML, BL) of IVCW. Zeolites deployed in the upper layer (UL) of IVCW reduced the overall N removal efficiency compared with gravels, due to a stronger nitrification but weaker denitrification. Canna indica (C. indica) was superior to Arundo donax (A. donax) and Thalia dealbata (T. dealbata) for N removal in the UL of IVCW due to higher aboveground biomass accumulation and microbial removal during the first 10months. Stronger nitrification and denitrification were simultaneously facilitated near the rhizosphere of C. indica. When entered into Dec., A. donax performed higher N removal efficiency than the other two species. The internal replenishment of peats in the ML as carbon sources significantly improved N and P removal efficiency. Zeolites with stronger capacity of ammonium (NH4+) adsorption was more in favor of anammox in the BL, when compared with roseites, but both of them were not conducive to the growth of denitrifiers. However, the deployment of shale ceramisites obtained an opposite result. Gemmata and Pirellula as anammox bacteria were more enriched in the zeolite layer, whereas some anaerobic denitrifiers (Corynebacterium and Paludibacter) and heterotrophic denitrifiers including Bacillus, Geobacter, Pseudomonas, and Lactococcus were more found in shale ceramisite. Supply of peats as carbon sources in the ML was beneficial for the adhesion of anammox bacteria and denitrifiers in the BL of shale ceramisites. An ideal model composed of C. indica+A. donax (DFU)-gravel (UL)-anthracite+peat (ML)-zeolite+shale ceramsite (BL)-Acorus calamus (UFU) was proposed for treating this type of river water to achieve high efficiency.

AB Northern peatlands constitute an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle due to their long-term accumulation of soil organic matter. This function as a carbon sink is partly dependent on low temperatures limiting decomposition and nutrient cycling, so global warming has the potential to alter the C balance of these systems and feedback to climate change. Field observations have shown that peatland organic matter decomposition, ecosystem respiration and nitrogen cycling are closely related processes that show a large degree of temperature sensitivity. In the current study, we investigated whether seasonal dynamics of substrate input may be an indirect mechanism accounting for this observed sensitivity. We carried out a 60-day mesocosm incubation experiment with sub-arctic peat soil to compare the direct effects of temperature increase with the indirect effects of increased microbial- or plant-derived organic matter input on key soil C and N cycling processes and substrate pools. Additions of dead microbial cells led to an 83% increase in organic N pool sizes, 16-64% increases in the potential activities of most soil enzymes, a transient increase in the relative abundance of beta-proteobacteria, and a decrease in the relative abundance of alpha-proteo-, Actino- and Acido-bacteria. Neither the addition of plant root litter, nor a 5 degrees C alteration in incubation temperatures, had comparable effects on these parameters. Peat respiration was positively affected by both substrate addition (20-46% increase) and higher incubation temperatures (34-38% increase), but the temperature-only effect was not sufficient to account for the increases in respiration observed in field experiments. Thus, it appears that warming effects on C and N cycle processes can potentially be driven by indirect effects, with alterations to the seasonal flux of microbe-derived organic matter a particularly potent mechanism. The high temperature sensitivity of decomposition and respiration may therefore be largely a result of warming-induced changes in substrate supply rates. We propose that climate change models of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling should seek to incorporate realistic microbial biomass dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Freshwater pools commonly form eccentric crescent patterns in peatlands, an important atmospheric methane (CH4) source, and show an apparent spatial association with eskers in some deglaciated regions. However, the role of underlying permeable glacial deposits such as eskers in regulating hydrogeology, and perhaps even carbon cycling, in peatlands is rarely considered. In this study, ground-penetrating radar imaging and direct coring confirmed that clustered pools coincide with buried esker crests in contact with peat soil in Caribou Bog and Kanokolus Bog in Maine (USA). Hydraulic head and geochemical data combined with lidar indicate vertical water flow from shallow peat toward the permeable esker crests, suggesting enhanced downward transport of labile organic carbon that presumably accelerates rates of methanogenesis in deep peat. Eskers might therefore serve as proxies for enhanced CH4 production in deep peat, as supported by differences in dissolved CH4 profiles depending on proximity to pools. Geographic data compiled from multiple sources suggest that many peatlands with eccentric pools appear to be located proximal to esker systems in Maine and Fennoscandia. These geological factors may be important, previously unrecognized controls on water and the carbon cycle in peatlands.

AB This study presents the first annual estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) of contrasting Danish agricultural peatlands. Studies were done at eight sites representing permanent grasslands (PG) and rotational (RT) arable soils cropped to barley, potato or forage grasses in three geo-regional settings. Using an advanced flux-chamber technique, NEE was derived from modelling of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP) with temperature and photosynthetically active radiation as driving variables. At PG (n = 3) and RT (n = 5) sites, NEE (mean +/- standard error, SE) was 5.1 +/- 0.9 and 8.6 +/- 2.0 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, but with the overall lowest value observed for potato cropping (3.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). This was partly attributed to a short-duration vegetation period and drying of the soil especially in potato ridges. NECB, derived from NEE and C-removal in harvested biomass, was equivalent to 8.4 +/- 1.0 and 11.5 +/- 2.0 Mg C ha(-1) for the PG and RT land-use types, respectively. Means were not significantly different, P = 0.214, and were comparable to a wider range of high-end emission factors for managed organic soils in boreal and temperate climate zones. It was stressed that evaluation of emission factors should explicitly differentiate between data representing net C balance from a soil perspective and CO2-C balance from an atmospheric perspective. Modelling of inter-annual variability in NEE for three selected sites during a 21-year meteorological period indicated a range of 18-67% (coefficients of variation). Yet, the robustness of these estimates and their importance for the derived emission factors needs to be substantiated experimentally. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change may cause increasing tree cover in boreal peatlands, and the impacts of this encroachment will be noted first at forested-to-open bog ecotones. We investigate key metrics of ecosystem function in five such ecotones at a peatland complex in Western Siberia. Stratigraphic analysis of three cores from one of these transects shows that the ecotone has been dynamic over time with evidence for recent expansion of forested peatland. We observed that the two alternative states for northern boreal peatlands (forested/open) clearly support distinct plant and microbial communities. These in turn drive and respond to a number of feedback mechanisms. This has led to steep ecological gradients across the ecotones. Tree cover was associated with lower water tables and pH, along with higher bulk density, aquatic carbon concentrations, and electrical conductivity. We propose that the conditions found in the forested peatland of Western Siberia make the carbon sink more vulnerable to warmer and drier conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Plant autotrophic respiration is responsible for the atmospheric release of about half of all photosynthetically fixed carbon and responds to climate change in a manner different from photosynthesis. The plant mass-specific respiration rate (r(A)), a key parameter of the carbon cycle, has not been sufficiently constrained by observations at ecosystem or broader scales. In this study, a meta-analysis revealed a global relationship with vegetation biomass that explains 67-77% of the variance of r(A) across plant ages and biomes. r(A) decreased with increasing vegetation biomass such that annual r(A) was two orders of magnitude larger in fens and deserts than in mature forests. This relationship can be closely approximated by a power-law equation with a universal exponent and yields an estimated global autotrophic respiration rate of 64 +/- 12 Pg C yr(-1). This finding, which is phenomenologically and theoretically consistent with metabolic scaling and plant demography, provides a way to constrain the carbon-cycle components of Earth system models.

AB Substantial deposits of peat have accumulated since the last glacial. Since peat accumulation rates are rather low, this process was previously neglected in carbon cycle models. For assessments of the global carbon cycle on millennial or even longer timescales, though, the carbon storage in peat cannot be neglected any more. We have therefore developed a dynamic model of wetland extent and peat accumulation in order to assess the influence of peat accumulation on the global carbon cycle.
   The model is based on the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ and consists of a wetland module and routines describing the accumulation and decay of peat. The wetland module, based on the TOPMODEL approach, dynamically determines inundated area and water table, which change depending on climate. Not all temporarily inundated areas accumulate peat, though, but peat accumulates in permanently inundated areas with rather stable water table position. Peatland area therefore is highly uncertain, and we perform sensitivity experiments to cover the uncertainty range for peatland extent. The peat module describes oxic and anoxic decomposition of organic matter in the acrotelm, i.e., the part of the peat column above the permanent water table, as well as anoxic decomposition in the catotelm, the peat below the summer minimum water table.
   We apply the model to the period of the last 8000 years, during which the model accumulates 330 PgC as catotelm peat in the peatland areas north of 40 degrees N, with an uncertainty range from 240 PgC to 490 PgC. This falls well within the range of published estimates for the total peat storage in high northern latitudes, considering the fact that these usually cover the total carbon accumulated, not just the last 8000 years we considered in our model experiments. In the model, peat primarily accumulates in Scandinavia and eastern Canada, though eastern Europe and north-western Russia also show substantial accumulation. Modelled wetland distribution is biased towards Eurasia, where inundated area is overestimated, while it is underestimated in North America. Latitudinal sums compare favourably to measurements, though, implying that total areas, as well as climatic conditions in these areas, are captured reasonably, though the exact positions of peatlands are not modelled well. Since modelling the initiation of peatland growth requires a knowledge of topography below peat deposits, the temporal development of peatlands is not modelled explicitly, therefore overestimating peatland extent during the earlier part of our experiments.
   Overall our results highlight the substantial amounts of carbon taken up by peatlands during the last 8000 years. This uptake would have substantial impacts on the global carbon cycle and therefore cannot be neglected.

AB The carbon budget dynamics of peatlands plays a crucial role in both the response of peatland ecosystems to environmental change and the effect of environmental change on peatlands. Studies on northern peatlands have suggested that the reliable assessment of the carbon budget must include the carbon flux at the land-stream interface. But this argument has not been proved in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the world's largest alpine system. To address the knowledge gap, in the growing season (May to October) of 2016, we chose Riganqiao peatland, a typical peatland in the Zoige Basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau which has been intensely drained via ditches since the 1960s. The objective of this study was to measure the organic carbon export from ditches, and to estimate what proportion of the carbon budget can be attributed to this export. Results showed that, during the growing season in 2016, total organic carbon flux in ditches was 2,345 t (8.6 g m(-2)), of which particulate organic carbon accounted for 12% and dissolved organic carbon for 88%. This flux decreased the carbon budget of Riganqiao peatland by 11.2% (from +76.8 g m(-2) to +68.2 g m(-2)), making it a weakened carbon sink. This result revealed that organic carbon export from ditches plays an important role in the carbon balance in peatland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB Northern peatlands store a large amount of carbon and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. Owing to the presence of waterlogged and anaerobic conditions, peatlands are typically a source of methane (CH4), a very potent greenhouse gas. This paper reviews the key mechanisms of peatland CH4 production, consumption and transport and the major environmental and biotic controls on peatland CH4 emissions. The advantages and disadvantages of micrometeorological and chamber methods in measuring CH4 fluxes from northern peatlands are also discussed. The magnitude of CH4 flux varies considerably among peatland types (bogs and fens) and microtopographic locations (hummocks and hollows). Some anthropogenic activities including forestry, peat harvesting and industrial emission of sulphur dioxide can cause a reduction in CH4 release from northern peatlands. Further research should be conducted to investigate the influence of plant growth forms on CH4 flux from northern peatlands, determine the water table threshold at which plant production in peatlands enhances CH4 release, and quantify peatland CH4 exchange at plant community level with a higher temporal resolution using automatic chambers.

AB Peatlands represent the largest and most concentrated carbon pool in the terrestrial biosphere, and their dynamics during the Holocene have had significant impacts on the global carbon cycle. In this Introduction paper, we provide an overview of the contributions presented in this Special Issue on Holocene peatland carbon dynamics. We also provide a brief history and current status of peat-core-based research on peatland carbon dynamics. Finally, we identify and discuss some challenges and opportunities that would guide peatland carbon research in the near future. These challenges and opportunities include the need to fill data gaps and increase geographic representations of peat carbon accumulation records, a better understanding of peatland lateral expansion process and improved estimate of peatland area change over time, developing regional carbon accumulation histories and carbon pool estimates, and projecting and quantifying overall peatland net carbon balance in a changing world.

AB Plant growth forms can influence carbon cycling, particularly in carbon-rich ecosystems like northern peatlands; however, mechanistic evidence of this relationship is limited. Our aim was to determine if northern peatland plant growth forms alter belowground dissolved carbon chemistry and enhance carbon release through stimulated microbial metabolism.
   We used replicated, peat monoliths populated exclusively by Sphagnum mosses, graminoids, or bare peat and quantified changes in belowground dissolved organic carbon chemistry, microbial metabolism, as well as respired CO2.
   The graminoid growth form was significantly distinct in belowground dissolved organic carbon chemistry with carbon compound lability 20 % and 11 % greater than bare peat and Sphagnum moss respectively. The labile dissolved organic carbon stimulated the microbial community, as indicated by greater microbial metabolic activity and richness values in conjunction with 50 % higher respired CO2 fluxes under the graminoid treatment.
   Our results provide mechanistic evidence that peatland plant growth forms can drive carbon cycling processes by altering dissolved organic carbon chemistry to prompt cascading effects on the microbial community and carbon release - trends suggestive of microbial priming effects. Should climate change increase graminoid prevalence at the expense of Sphagnum moss northern peatland carbon store stability may be threatened by this mechanism.

AB Permafrost peatland plays an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the most important components to C budgets in this system. Through the Chinese-United States EcoPartnership program, Dr Xianwei Wang, Li Sun, and Prof Changchun Song et al. from the Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof Aixin Hou from the Louisiana State University observed dynamics of DOC concentrations and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) obtained from soil porewater of permafrost peatlands for two growing seasons in the Great Hing'an Mountains, Northeast China. Soil porewater DOC concentrations varied greatly with depths during the growing season, ranging between 22.08 and 65.02 mg L-1. There was no significant relationship between DOC concentrations and SUVA(254). DOC concentrations were higher in autumn and increased as the seasonal thaw depth increased. DOC concentrations of supra-permafrost water at freeze-thaw boundary were also higher than those at the other soil depths. Temperature and thawing depth had been shown to affect DOC concentrations at different soil depths. Our finding suggests that warming and deepening of the active layer likely increase the DOC productions in the permafrost peatland, which may influence the C balance in these C-enriched ecosystems.

AB The majority of northern peatlands were initiated during the Holocene. Owing to their mass imbalance, they have sequestered huge amounts of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. Although recent syntheses have filled some knowledge gaps, the extent and remoteness of many peatlands pose challenges to developing reliable regional carbon accumulation estimates from observations. In this work, we employed an individual- and patch-based dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) with peatland and permafrost functionality to quantify long-term carbon accumulation rates in northern peatlands and to assess the effects of historical and projected future climate change on peatland carbon balance. We combined published datasets of peat basal age to form an up-to-date peat inception surface for the pan-Arctic region which we then used to constrain the model. We divided our analysis into two parts, with a focus both on the carbon accumulation changes detected within the observed peatland boundary and at pan-Arctic scale under two contrasting warming scenarios (representative concentration pathway-RCP8.5 and RCP2.6). We found that peatlands continue to act as carbon sinks under both warming scenarios, but their sink capacity will be substantially reduced under the high-warming (RCP8.5) scenario after 2050. Areas where peat production was initially hampered by permafrost and low productivity were found to accumulate more carbon because of the initial warming and moisture-rich environment due to permafrost thaw, higher precipitation and elevated CO2 levels. On the other hand, we project that areas which will experience reduced precipitation rates and those without permafrost will lose more carbon in the near future, particularly peatlands located in the European region and between 45 and 55 degrees N latitude. Overall, we found that rapid global warming could reduce the carbon sink capacity of the northern peatlands in the coming decades.

AB The response of peatlands to climate change can be highly variable. Through understanding past changes we can better predict the response of peatlands to future climate change. We use a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct the surface wetness and carbon accumulation of the Mukhrino mire (Western Siberia), describing the development of the mire since peat formation in the early Holocene, around 9360 cal. year BP. The mire started as a rich fen which initiated after paludification of a spruce forest (probably in response to a wetter climate), while the Mukhrino mire progressed to ombrotrophic bog conditions (8760 cal. year BP). This transition coincided with the intensive development of mires in Western Siberia and was associated with active carbon accumulation (31 g m(-2) year(-1)). The ecosystem underwent a change to a tree-covered state around 5860 cal. year BP, likely in response to warming and possible droughts and this accompanied low carbon accumulation (12 g m(2) year(-1)). If the future climate will be warmer and wetter, then regional mires are likely to remain a carbon sink, alternatively, a reversion to the wooded state with reduced carbon sink strength is possible.

AB Rewetting of drained peatlands has been recommended to reduce CO2 emissions and to restore the carbon sink function of peatlands. Recently, the combination of rewetting and biomass production (paludiculture) has gained interest as a possible land use option in peatlands for obtaining such benefits of lower CO2 emissions without losing agricultural land. This study quantified the carbon balance (CO2, CH4 and harvested biomass C) of rewetted and drained peat soils under intensively managed reed canary grass (RCG) cultivation. Mesocosms were maintained at five different groundwater levels (GWLs), that is 0, 10, 20cm below the soil surface, representing rewetted peat soils, and 30 and 40cm below the soil surface, representing drained peat soils. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and CH4 emissions was measured during the growing period of RCG (May to September) using transparent and opaque closed chamber methods. The average dry biomass yield was significantly lower from rewetted peat soils (12Mgha(-1)) than drained peat soils (15Mgha(-1)). Also, CO2 fluxes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) from rewetted peat soils were significantly lower than from drained peat soils, but net uptake of CO2 was higher from rewetted peat soils. Cumulative CH4 emissions were negligible (0.01g CH(4)m(-2)) from drained peat soils but were significantly higher (4.9g CH(4)m(-2)) from rewetted peat soils during measurement period (01 May-15 September 2013). The extrapolated annual C balance was 0.03 and 0.68kg C m(-2) from rewetted and drained peat soils, respectively, indicating that rewetting and paludiculture can reduce the loss of carbon from peatlands.

AB Sphagnum peat moss was supplemented with 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg as C/cm3 of medium using glucose, galactose, succinate, or acetate as a carbon source.  These treatments were factorially combined with 0, 30, or 60-mu-g N/cm3 using ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source.  Medium treatments were then incubated at 20-degrees-C and 40% water holding capacity.  Urease activity was determined immediately prior to treatment (day = 0), and 7, 14, and 21 days following treatment.  In another study, sphagnum peat was treated with 1.0 mg C/cm3 of medium using galactose as a carbon source.  These treatments were factorially combined with 0 or 60-mu-g N cm3 medium using either ammonium sulfate or urea as a nitrogen source.  Treatments were incubated and assayed for urease activity as described for the previous experiment.  In the first experiment, the addition of carbon stimulated urease activity with activity being greatest for the highest rate of carbon.  Treatments receiving the two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, showed greater urease activity levels with treatments receiving galactose having the greatest urease activity.  The addition of ammonium retarded the increase in urease activity from the addition of carbon.  In the second experiment, in the absence of galactose, urease activity increased in samples supplemented with urea as compared to when ammonium was added.  When galactose was present, the addition of urea had no effect on urease activity as compared to treatments receiving ammonium.

AB Peatlands in permafrost region are large carbon pools sensitive to global warming. However, the effects of increased temperature on carbon emissions and associated microbial abundances of peatlands under anaerobic condition remain largely unknown, especially when considering depths. For supplementing the deficiency about this, we collected soil from 0 to 150 cm depth of a permafrost peatland in the Great Hing'an Mountain and incubated at 5 and 15 degrees C for 55 days under anaerobic condition. Soil CO2 and CH4 emissions were detected during incubation, and inorganic nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and carbon-cycling microbial abundances were analyzed at the end of incubation. Results showed that emission rates and cumulative emissions amount of CO2 and CH4 at 15 degrees C across all soil depths were higher than those observed at 5 degrees C. Specifically, 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm layers had the highest CO2 emission rates and cumulative emission amounts, whereas the 40-60 cm and 60-80 cm layers had the highest CH4 emission rates and cumulative emission amounts. Mean temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) values of CO2 and CH(4 )were 2.39 and 55.49 respectively. Q(10) values of bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, and methanotroph abundances were 1.17, 3.85, 1.75, 1.68, and 1.66 respectively, which were calculated by the abundance ratio of microbial functional gene at 15 degrees C and 5 degrees C. Similar to the trend of CO2 emissions, high bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, and methanotroph functional gene abundances were also observed in 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm layers, and such abundances increased along with temperature increasing. In sum, elevated temperature enhances the carbon emission of peatland in permafrost region, and the warming simulated CO2 emission is linked to the abundances of carbon-cycling microorganisms.

AB Sphagnum peatmosses play an important part in water table management of many peatland ecosystems. Keeping the ecosystem saturated, they slow the breakdown of organic matter and release of greenhouse gases, facilitating peatland's function as a carbon sink rather than a carbon source. Although peatland monitoring and restoration programs have increased recently, there are few tools to quantify traits that Sphagnum species display in their ecosystems. Colony density is often described as an important determinant in the establishment and performance in Sphagnum but detailed evidence for this is limited. In this study, we describe an image analysis pipeline that accurately annotates Sphagnum capitula and estimates plant density using open access computer vision packages. The pipeline was validated using images of different Sphagnum species growing in different habitats, taken on different days and with different smartphones. The developed pipeline achieves high accuracy scores, and we demonstrate its utility by estimating colony densities in the field and detecting intra and inter-specific colony densities and their relationship with habitat. This tool will enable ecologists and conservationists to rapidly acquire accurate estimates of Sphagnum density in the field without the need of specialised equipment.

AB [1] Peatlands represent an important component of the global carbon cycle, storing 23 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Peatland mining eliminates the carbon sink function of the peatland. In this paper we measure the total ecosystem respiration in a natural, 2 and 3 year (young) and 7 and 8 year (old) postcutover peatland near Sainte-Marguerite- Marie, Quebec, during the summers of 1998 and 1999. Although the natural site was a source of CO2 during the dry 1998 study season (138 g C m(-2)), CO2 emissions were between 260 and 290% higher in the cutover sites (363 and 399 g C m(-2) for young and old, respectively). Cutover site CO2 emissions were only 88 and 112 g CO2-C m(-2) at the young and old sites during the wet 1999 study season. Total ecosystem respiration was more dependent on the water table position than on changes in the thermal regime or the labile carbon of the peat in a dry summer, but the opposite was the case in a wet summer. CO2 emissions increased with postharvest time regardless of a decrease in labile carbon, demonstrating that cutover peatlands are a large persistent source of atmospheric CO2. Direct measurement of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in cutover peatlands, as opposed to determining the loss of carbon from bulk density determinations, provides a better understanding of how peat drainage and harvesting operations affect the carbon balance in peatlands.

AB This work investigates the application of a solid anolyte microbial fuel cell (saMFC) as a long-lasting source of electricity for powering electronic devices. Broadly available biodegradable materials such as humus, cattle manure, peat moss, and sawdust are evaluated as solid anolytes. The initial comparison shows significantly higher power production in the saMFC operated using humus as compared to other solid anolytes. At the same time, power production in the humus-based saMFC is found to decline after about 40 days of operation, while the sawdust MFC demonstrates stable performance over the test period. Following this initial comparison, a combined humus - sawdust anolyte is developed to increase saMFC life span. The optimized saMFC demonstrates stable power production for over nine months. Furthermore, power production in the saMFC is maximized by using an intermittent connection to an electrical load (on/off operation) and optimizing the connection/disconnection times. These results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing solid anolytes for developing inexpensive and long-lasting biobatteries operated on renewable carbon sources.

AB Burial of organic carbon (OC) in marine sediments is one of the most important linkages between the short-term biologic carbon cycle and the long-term geologic carbon cycle. Yet much is still unknown about the fate of terrigenous OC in marine coastal margins. Here the delivery of particulate OC (POC) to the Colville River deltaic region in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea by particulates of varying densities is studied through the use of ramped temperature pyrolysis and radiocarbon analyses. The Colville River is the largest river in North America whose watershed is underlain completely by high Arctic permafrost tundra. A variety of sources of POC are considered, including terrestrial soils, Pleistocene-aged yedoma-like sediments, coastal peat erosion, and marine POC. We provide the first evidence that riverine POC from the Colville River contains old (Pleistocene-sourced) OC, suggesting ongoing thaw and mobilization of yedoma-like permafrost OC from this northern Alaskan watershed. Additionally, much of this OC appears to be fairly labile and therefore could be readily oxidized and returned to the atmosphere.

AB Electron-donating phenolic and electron-accepting quinone moieties in peat dissolved organic matter (DOM) are considered to play key roles in processes defining carbon cycling in northern peatlands. This work advances a flow-injection analysis system coupled to chronoamperometric detection to allow for the simultaneous and highly sensitive determination of these moieties in dilute DOM samples. Analysis of anoxic pore water and oxic pool water samples collected across an ombrotrophic bog in Sweden demonstrated the presence of both phenolic and quinone moieties in peat DOM. The pore water DOM had higher quantities of phenolic but not quinone moieties compared with commonly used model aquatic and terrestrial DOM isolates. Significantly lower phenol content in DOM from oxic pools than DOM from anoxic pore waters indicated oxidative DOM processing in the pools. Consistently, treatment of peat DOM with laccase, a phenol-oxidase, under oxic conditions resulted in an irreversible removal of phenols and reversible oxidation of hydroquinones to quinones. Electron transfer to peat DOM was fully reversible over an electrochemical reduction and subsequent O-2-reoxidation cycle, supporting that quinones in peat DOM serve as regenerable microbial electron acceptors in peatlands. The results advance our understanding of redox processes involving phenolic and quinone DOM moieties and their roles in northern peatland carbon cycling.

AB [1] Northern peatlands contain enormous quantities of organic carbon within a few meters of the atmosphere and play a significant role in the planetary carbon balance. We have developed a new, process-oriented model of the contemporary carbon balance of northern peatlands, the Peatland Carbon Simulator (PCARS). Components of PCARS are (1) vascular and nonvascular plant photosynthesis and respiration, net aboveground and belowground production, and litterfall; (2) aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of peat; (3) production, oxidation, and emission of methane; and (4) dissolved organic carbon loss with drainage water. PCARS has an hourly time step and requires air and soil temperatures, incoming radiation, water table depth, and horizontal drainage as drivers. Simulations predict a complete peatland C balance for one season to several years. A 3-year simulation was conducted for Mer Bleue Bog, near Ottawa, Ontario, and results were compared with multiyear eddy covariance tower CO(2) flux and ancillary measurements from the site. Seasonal patterns and the general magnitude of net ecosystem exchange of CO(2) were similar for PCARS and the tower data, though PCARS was generally biased toward net ecosystem respiration (i.e., carbon loss). Gross photosynthesis rates (calculated directly in PCARS, empirically inferred from tower data) were in good accord, so the discrepancy between model and measurement was likely related to autotrophic and/or heterotrophic respiration. Modeled and measured methane emission rates were quite low. PCARS has been designed to link with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) land surface model and a global climate model (GCM) to examine climate-peatland carbon feedbacks at regional scales in future analyses.

AB A review of the global cycle of methane is presented with emphasis on its isotopic composition. The history of methane mixing ratios, reconstructed from measurements of air trapped in ice-cores is described. The methane record now extends back to 420 kyr ago in the case of the Vostok ice cores from Antarctica. The trends in mixing ratios and in delta(13)C values are reported for the two Hemispheres. The increase of the atmospheric methane concentration over the past 200 years, and by 1% per year since 1978, reaching 1.7 ppmv in 1990 is underlined.
   The various methane sources are presented. Indeed the authors describe the methane emissions by bacterial activity under anaerobic conditions in wet environments (wetlands, bogs, tundra, rice paddies), in ruminant stomachs and termite guts, and that originating from fossil carbon sources, such as biomass burning, coal mining, industrial losses, automobile exhaust, sea floor vent, and volcanic emissions. Furthermore, the main sinks of methane in the troposphere, soils or waters via oxidation are also reported, and the corresponding kinetic isotope effects.

AB Peatland ecosystems are important carbon sinks, but also release carbon back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane. Peatlands therefore play an essential role in the global carbon cycle. However, the response of high-latitude peatlands to ongoing climate change is still not fully understood. In this study, we used plant macrofossils and peat property analyses as proxies to document changes in vegetation and peat and carbon accumulation after the Little Ice Age. Results from 12 peat monoliths collected in high-boreal and low-subarctic regions in northwestern Quebec, Canada, suggest high carbon accumulation rates for the recent past (post AD 1970s). Successional changes in plant assemblages were asynchronous within the cores in the southernmost region, but more consistent in the northern region. Average apparent recent carbon accumulation rates varied between 50.7 and 149.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with the northernmost study region showing higher values. The variation in vegetation records and peat properties found within samples taken from the same sites and amongst cores taken from different regions highlights the need to investigate multiple records from each peatland, but also from different peatlands within one region.

AB The role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle is confounded by two inconsistencies. First, peatlands have been a large reservoir for carbon sequestered in the past, but may be either net sources or net sinks at present. Second, long-term rates of peal accumulation (and hence carbon sequestration) are surprisingly steady despite great variability in the short-term rates of peat formation. Here, we present a feedback mechanism that can explain how fine-scale and short-term variability in peal-forming processes is constrained to give steady rates of pear accumulation over longer time-scales. The feedback mechanism depends on a humpbacked relationship between the rate of peal formation and the thickness of the aerobic surface layer (the acrotelm), such that individual microforms (hummocks, lawns, hollows and pools) expand or contract vertically in response to fluctuations in the position of the water table. Hummocks (but not hollows) 'evolve' to a steady slate where changes in acrotelm thickness compensate for climate-mediated variations in surface wetness. With long-term growth of a topographically confined peat deposit, the steady state gradually shifts to a thicker acrotelm (i.e. taller hummocks) and lower rates of peat formation and carbon sequestration.

AB Fusarium wilts are economically important diseases for which there are no effective chemical control measures. Biological control strategies are becoming efficient alternatives for controlling this disease. The suppressiveness to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici race 1 of grape marc compost and cork compost was evaluated in comparison to peat by using a susceptible cultivar of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Marmande). Based on community level physiological profiles, different community structures were evident among the plant growth media evaluated. The peat microbial community, growth medium conducive to wilt, used mostly sugars, while those associated with both composts, the very suppressive grape marc and the moderately suppressive cork, used mostly carboxylic acids, amino acids, arnines, phenolic compounds and polymers.

AB Root exudates and litter are the main sources of inputs of labile carbon into the microbial pool in successional ecosystems. Here we studied whether typical pioneer species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum angustifolium and Calluna vulgaris) alter the functional response of the microbial community of a previously cutover peatland. Peat was sampled at three depths (0-5, 20-25 and 40-45 cm) from beneath these species and from bare soil areas. MicroResp analysis using ecologically relevant, radiolabelled, carbon sources showed significant separation in community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of soil microorganisms according to peat depth. This effect was also reflected in microbial biomass carbon, which also decreased with increasing depth. Furthermore, distinct differences in CLPP were observed between the three plant species and the bare soil in the absence of an effect on microbial biomass carbon or total soil carbon. The plant species effects were driven by differential utilisation of xylose, glutamic acid, lysine and phenylethylamine. The data suggest that 'new' carbon inputs from plants colonising abandoned cutover peatland may support communities of microorganisms that have functionally distinct roles in carbon turnover.

AB Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the soil carbon cycle. How phenol oxidase activity in peatlands will respond to increased aeration induced by water-table drawdown or droughts if global warming continues remains unclear. We investigated the short-term effects of drought induced acidification on phenol oxidase activities of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland in central China. The results indicated a significant acidification induced by drought, with a decline in the average pH value from 5.67 +/- A 0.08 under waterlogging to 4.84 +/- A 0.08 in droughted peat. In addition, drought-treated peat had a lower average value of phenol oxidase activities compared to the waterlogging-treated peat (mean values of 0.1404 +/- A 0.0305 and 0.2623 +/- A 0.0324 mu mol diqc min(-1) g(-1), respectively). The decreased phenol oxidase activities were mainly attributed to the acidification induced by drought. However, the declines in phenol oxidase activity did not lead to the reduction of the degradation in the deeper peat. Under drought conditions, a considerable part of the adsorbed phenolics, consisting primarily of high molecular-weight organic substances with phenolic groups, were further degraded into smaller-sized or lower molecular weight hydrophilic fractions in the vicinity of the water table. Our results highlight the important role of the water table position in peat decomposition processes. Even with lower activities of phenol oxidase, the decomposition processes were able to effectively keep on going as long as there was sufficient supply of water, oxygen and nutrients.

AB Due to anaerobic conditions, peatland soils store globally significant amounts of carbon and are an important source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. One component of anaerobic carbon cycling, homoacetogenesis (i.e., acetate formation from carbon dioxide and dihydrogen via the acetyl-CoA pathway), has rarely been quantified in natural environments because it is commonly viewed as being thermodynamically unfavorable. Here we show that in a laboratory incubation using a tracer method, homoacetogenesis occurred at significant rates in soils from three peatlands (bog, intermediate fen, and cedar swamp) despite thermodynamic conditions that appeared to be unfavorable for this process. Homoacetogens consumed dihydrogen at rates up to 3- to 10-times faster than methanogens, and homoacetogenesis accounted for 16-63% of total acetate production, with the balance likely coming from fermentation processes. Our results show that homoacetogenesis can play an important role in regulating acetate dynamics, methane production, and carbon cycling in peatlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands store globally significant quantities of soil carbon, and Sphagnum moss is the main peat forming vegetation type in bogs. Sphagnum moss productivity is driven by the moisture content of its apical cluster of branches, the capitulum. Capitulum moisture content is dependent on the arrangement of leaves, branches and stems for a given species and also on hydrological conditions of the underlying peat. Despite this link, the response of CO2 exchange in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands to extreme drought is still unclear, particularly under field conditions.
   We used drainage to expose Sphagnum rubellum to extreme drought and monitored water table, volumetric water content (VWC), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at plots in a 25 m transect perpendicular to a deep drainage ditch and compared results to an undrained site. VWC in the upper 10 cm of peat was strongly related to water table at depths shallower than 55 cm. Below this depth, near surface VWC remained relatively constant between 25 and 28% and Sphagnum GEP was effectively shut down. This also resulted in decreased ER at these locations. The combined effect was a linear relationship between VWC and NEE with moist sites acting as net CO2 sinks (up to -5 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) whereas sites closest to the ditch were consistently small carbon sources. We suggest that understanding how climate change will alter peatland hydrology relative to the moisture thresholds of Sphagnum mosses is critical to determining the fate of their carbon sink function.

AB Current practice for dealing with oil spills involves the use of adsorbent materials to contain the pollution prior to bioremediation of the contaminated soil and adsorbent. This work presents a study of the effects of bioavailable carbon sources in the adsorbents peat and sawdust as organic nutrients for microorganisms specialized in degrading n-dodecane in soil and sawdust contaminated with hydrocarbon mixtures. An experimental bioremediation system was developed using n-dodecane, biomass adapted to n-dodecane, inorganic nutrients and the two adsorbents (sterilized). Bioreactors containing peat enhanced cell growth the most and also evolved more CO2. An advantage of peat is that its soluble carbon sources can sustain higher cell densities compared to sawdust, and this may prove decisive when cultivating endogenous microorganisms for the aerobic bioremediation of soils contaminated with hydrocarbons. However, at the end of the 68-day experiment slightly higher n-dodecane removal was identified in the system containing sawdust-n-dodecane (99.6%) than in that with peat-n-dodecane (98.5%), evidencing the higher hydrocarbon retention capacity of peat. Based on this study, the use of sawdust instead of peat is recommended when an adapted inoculum is available for aerobic bioremediation of organic contaminants, whereas the use of peat is advisable to boost cell densities in order to improve the probability of sustaining a viable biomass in unfavorable conditions.

AB Peatlands are among the largest long-term soil carbon stores, but their degradation can lead to significant carbon losses. This study considers the carbon budget of peat-covered sites after restoration, following degradation by past wildfires. The study measured the carbon budget of eight sites: four restored-revegetated sites, two unrestored bare soil control sites, and two intact vegetated controls over two years (2006-2008). The study considered the following flux pathways: dissolved organic carbon (DOC); particulate organic carbon (POC); dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2); primary productivity; net ecosystem respiration, and methane (CH4). The study shows that unrestored, bare peat sites can have significant carbon losses as high as 522 +/- 3 tonnes C/km(2)/yr. Most sites showed improved carbon budgets (decreased source and/or increased sink of carbon) after restoration; this improvement was mainly in the form of a reduction in the size of the net carbon source, but for one restored site the measured carbon budget after four years of restoration was greater than observed for vegetated controls. The carbon sequestration benefit of peatland restoration would range between 122 and 833 tonnes C/km(2)/yr. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this study we investigated the role of intensive and extensive dairy farm practices on CO2 exchange and the carbon balance of peatlands by means of eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Year long EC measurements were made in two adjacent farm sites on peat soil in the western part of the Netherlands. One site (Stein) is a new meadow bird reserve and is managed predominantly by mowing in June and August. The second site (Oukoop) is an intensive dairy farm. Maximum photosynthetic uptake of the grass sward (range 2 to 34 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) showed a close and similar linear relationship with Leaf Area Index (LAI; range 1 to 5) except in maturing hay meadows, where maximum photosynthetic uptake did not increase further. Apparent quantum yield varied between 0.02 and 0.08 (mean 0.045) mu mol CO2 mu mol(-1) photons at both sites and was significantly correlated with LAI during the growth season. Ecosystem Respiration at 10 degrees C (R-10) calculated from the year round data set was 3.35 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at Stein and 3.69 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) at Oukoop. Both sites were a source of carbon in winter and a sink during summer with net ecosystem exchange varying between 50 to 100 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in winter to below -400 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in summer. Periodically, both sites became a source after mowing. Net annual ecosystem exchange (NEE) for Stein was -5.7 g C m(-2) a(-1) and for Oukoop 133.9 g C m(-2) a(-1). When biomass removal, manure applications and estimates of methane emissions ware taken into account, both eutrophic peat meadows are a strong source for C around 420 g C m(-2) a(-1).

TI Carbon cycle dynamics during episodes of rapid climate change
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Past climate records reveal many instances of rapid climate change that are often coincident with fast changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, suggesting links and positive feedbacks between the carbon cycle and the physical climate system. The carbon reservoirs that might have played an important role during these past episodes of rapid change include near-surface soil and peatland carbon, permafrost, carbon stored in vegetation, methane hydrates in deep-sea sediments, volcanism, and carbon stored in parts of the ocean that are easily ventilated through changes in circulation. To determine whether similar changes might lie in store in our future, we must gain a better understanding of the physics, biogeochemistry, dynamics, and feedbacks involved in such events. Specifically, we need to ascertain the main natural sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane linked to rapid climate events in the paleoclimate record, and understand the mechanisms, triggers, thresholds, and feedbacks that were involved. Our review contributes to this focus issue by synthesizing results from nine studies covering a broad range of past time episodes. Studies are categorized into (a) episodes of massive carbon release millions of years ago; (b) the transition from the last glacial to the current interglacial 19 000-11 000 years ago; and (c) the current era. We conclude with a discussion on major remaining research challenges and implications for future projections and risk assessment.

AB Climate change threatens to release abundant carbon that is sequestered at high latitudes, but the constraints on microbial metabolisms that mediate the release of methane and carbon dioxide are poorly understood(1-7). The role of viruses, which are known to affect microbial dynamics, metabolism and biogeochemistry in the oceans(8-10), remains largely unexplored in soil. Here, we aimed to investigate how viruses influence microbial ecology and carbon metabolism in peatland soils along a permafrost thaw gradient in Sweden. We recovered 1,907 viral populations (genomes and large genome fragments) from 197 bulk soil and size-fractionated metagenomes, 58% of which were detected in metatranscriptomes and presumed to be active. In silico predictions linked 35% of the viruses to microbial host populations, highlighting likely viral predators of key carbon-cycling microorganisms, including methanogens and methanotrophs. Lineage-specific virus/host ratios varied, suggesting that viral infection dynamics may differentially impact microbial responses to a changing climate. Virus-encoded glycoside hydrolases, including an endomannanase with confirmed functional activity, indicated that viruses influence complex carbon degradation and that viral abundances were significant predictors of methane dynamics. These findings suggest that viruses may impact ecosystem function in climate-critical, terrestrial habitats and identify multiple potential viral contributions to soil carbon cycling.

AB Rising concentrations of tropospheric ozone are having detrimental impacts on the growth of crop and forest species and some studies have reported inhibition of the allocation of carbon below ground. The effects of ozone on peatland ecosystems have received relatively little attention, despite their importance within the global carbon cycle. During this study, cores from a Welsh minerotrophic fen and ombrotrophic bog were exposed to four ambient/elevated ozone concentration regimes representing current and predicted 2050 profiles. A large and significant reduction in the concentration of porewater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was recorded in the fen cores exposed to the elevated ozone concentrations (up to -55%), with a concurrent shift to a higher molecular weight of the remaining soil carbon. No effects of ozone on DOC concentrations or characteristics were recorded for the bog cores. The data suggest higher ozone sensitivity of plants growing in the fen-type peatland, that the impacts on the vegetation may affect soil carbon characteristics through a reduction in root exudates and that there may have been a shift in the source of substrate DOC for microbial consumption from vegetation exudates to native soil carbon. There may also have been a direct effect of ozone molecules reacting with soil organic matter after being transported into the soil through the aerenchyma tissue of the overlying vegetation. These qualitative changes in the soil carbon in response to elevated ozone may have important implications for carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems, and therefore climate change.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contains organic acid charge groups that contribute organic alkalinity (OrgAlk) to total alkalinity (TA). These effects are often ignored or treated as a calculation uncertainty in many aquatic CO2 studies. This study evaluated OrgAlk variability, sources, and characteristics in estuarine waters exchanged tidally with a groundwater-influenced salt marsh in the northeast USA. OrgAlk provided a biogeochemical link between organic and inorganic carbon cycling through its direct effects on pH, and thus CO2 system speciation and buffer capacity. Two main charge groups were identified including carboxylic and phenolic or amine groups. Terrestrial groundwater and in-situ production within salt marsh peat contributed OrgAlk to the tidal creek, with the former being a more significant source. Groundwater entering the marsh complex contained exceptionally high OrgAlk (> 150 mu mol kg(-1)), and these compounds were preferentially preserved within the DOC pool during groundwater transport and mixing with coastal water. OrgAlk:DOC ratios in groundwater and marshinfluenced water varied across space and time. This highlights the insufficiency of using a fixed proportion of DOC to account for organic acid charge groups. Accounting for OrgAlk altered H+ concentrations by similar to 1-41 nmol kg(-1)(equivalent to a pH change of similar to 0.03-0.26), pCO(2) by similar to 30-1600 mu atm and buffer capacity by similar to 0.00-0.14 mmol kg(-1) at the relative OrgAlk contributions of 0.9-4.3% of TA observed in the marsh-influenced tidal water. Thus, OrgAlk may have a significant influence on coastal inorganic carbon cycling. Further theoretical calculations confirm that these concentrations of OrgAlk would have sizable impacts on both carbonate speciation and, ultimately, air-sea CO2 fluxes in different coastal environments, ranging from estuarine to shelf waters. A new conceptual model linking organic and inorganic carbon cycling for coastal waters is proposed to highlight the sources and sinks of organic acid charge groups, as well as their biogeochemical behaviors and mechanistic control on the CO2 system.

AB Everglades freshwater marshes were once carbon sinks, but human-driven hydrologic changes have led to uncertainty about the current state of their carbon dynamics. To investigate the effect of hydrology on CO2 exchange, we used eddy covariance measurements for 2 years (2008-2009) in marl (short-hydroperiod) and peat (long-hydroperiod) wetlands in Everglades National Park. The importance of site, season, and environmental drivers was evaluated using linear and nonlinear modeling, and a novel method was used to test for temporally lagged patterns in the data. Unexpectedly, the long-hydroperiod peat marsh was a small CO2 source (19.9 g C m(-2) from July to December 2008 and 80.0 g C m(-2) in 2009), and at no time over the study period was it a strong sink. Contrary to previous research suggesting high productivity rates from a short-hydroperiod marsh, we estimated that the marl site was a small CO2 sink in 2008 (net ecosystem exchange [NEE] = -78.8 g C m(-2)) and was near neutral for carbon balance in 2009. In addition, both sites had relatively low gross ecosystem exchange (GEE) over the 2 years of this study. The two sites showed similar responses for NEE versus air temperature, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) versus air temperature, and R-eco versus water depth, although the magnitude of the responses differed. We saw small lags (30 min in most cases) between carbon fluxes and environmental drivers. This study is foundational for understanding the carbon balance of these ecosystems prior to implementation of the planned Everglades restoration of historical water flow that will likely alter the future trajectory of the carbon dynamics of the Everglades as a whole.

AB Arctic lakes and wetlands contribute a substantial amount of methane to the contemporary atmosphere, yet profound knowledge gaps remain regarding the intensity and climatic control of past methane emissions from this source. In this study, we reconstruct methane turnover and environmental conditions, including estimates of mean annual and summer temperature, from a thermokarst lake (Lake Qalluuraq) on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska for the Holocene by using source-specific lipid biomarkers preserved in a radiocarbon-dated sediment core. Our results document a more prominent role for methane in the carbon cycle when the lake basin was an emergent fen habitat between similar to 12,300 and similar to 10,000 cal yr BP, a time period closely coinciding with the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in North Alaska. Enhanced methane turnover was stimulated by relatively warm temperatures, increased moisture, nutrient supply, and primary productivity. After similar to 10,000 cal yr BP, a thermokarst lake with abundant submerged mosses evolved, and through the mid-Holocene temperatures were approximately 3 degrees C cooler. Under these conditions, organic matter decomposition was attenuated, which facilitated the accumulation of submerged mosses within a shallower Lake Qalluuraq. Reduced methane assimilation into biomass during the mid-Holocene suggests that thermokarst lakes are carbon sinks during cold periods. In the late-Holocene from similar to 2700 cal yr BP to the most recent time, however, temperatures and carbon deposition rose and methane oxidation intensified, indicating that more rapid organic matter decomposition and enhanced methane production could amplify climate feedback via potential methane emissions in the future.

AB The temperate peatlands are extensive, covering around 3.5 million km(2) of land. They contain about 455 Gt of carbon, almost equivalent to the carbon stored in all of the living things on the surface of the planet, and representing around 25% of all the soil carbon on earth. These bogs are a sink for atmospheric carbon and their carbon uptake accounts for about 12% of current human emissions. They vary considerably in their form and structure and are an important resource for scientific research, including the study of past environments and climate change, and they are also valuable in environmental education. They are low in biodiversity, but their fauna and flora are distinctive and many groups are confined to this habitat. For all these reasons, the future conservation of peatlands is a matter for concern. Threats to peatlands come from direct human exploitation in the form of peat harvesting for energy and horticulture, and drainage for forestry. Rising environmental awareness should control both of these processes in the western world, but continued northern peatland losses are likely locally, especially in Asia. Peatland drainage for forestry or agriculture will result in losses of carbon to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. Human population pressures, industrialization and urbanization are unlikely to have an important direct and immediate influence in the boreal zone. Fragmentation of the habitat is not an important consideration because bogs are by their very nature 'island' habitats. Acidification by aerial pollution may be a local problem close to sources, but the habitat is naturally acid and should not be severely affected, The input of aerial nutrients, however, particularly nitrogen, could have widespread impact on bogs, enhancing their productivity and altering their vegetation composition. The physical rehabilitation of bogs damaged by human activities presents many problems, particularly relating to the re-establishment of peat structure and vegetation, but the process can result in the re-formation of a carbon sink so it is worth the effort. Climate change is the most important consideration in its impact on bogs. Higher temperature (especially if accompanied by raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and increased nitrate deposition) will enhance productivity, but will also result in faster decomposition rates. The outcome of these opposing factors for peat formation will ultimately depend on the future pattern of precipitation. If, as seems most likely, summer conditions become warmer and drier in continental regions and winters become milder and wetter, the summer drought could cause peat loss and bog contraction. An excess of decomposition will lead to bogs becoming a carbon source and thus a positive feedback in global warming. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide would add to the greenhouse gas problem, but likely oxidation of methane and low N(2)O production may well mean that this impact will not prove to be significant. Tree invasion of bogs as a consequence of summer drought could locally lead to increased water loss through transpiration, and higher heat absorption through albedo change. This will enhance the drying effect on the bog surface. Oceanic mires will be less severely affected if the expected increase in precipitation takes place in these regions. The most important overall factor in determining the future of the northern bogs is likely to be the quantity and pattern (both spatially and temporally) of future precipitation in the zone.

AB Only little is known about the long-term carbon dynamics related to peatland restoration. We studied CO 2 and CH 4 dynamics of spontaneously regenerated peat trenches five decades after peat harvesting had ceased. We used non-linear regression models and interpolation for simulating gas exchange of four regenerating plant communities during two growing seasons and one winter. The studied communities all acted as seasonal (June-September) sinks of CO 2 between 14 and 118 g C m(-2), while the emissions of CH4 ranged from -4.9 to -28.8 g C m(-2). When the winter time losses of carbon and the estimated leaching were subtracted, the balance was very low or negative: between -67 and 31 g C m(-2). The low or even negative annual carbon balance in all communities may suggest a decrease in carbon sink strength in the advanced regeneration after the previously observed strong sink in the first regeneration stages caused by mass colonization by Eriophorum.

AB The northern wetlands are one of the major sources of methane into the atmosphere. We measured annual methane emission from a boreal minerotrophic fen, Siikaneva, by the eddy covariance method. The average wintertime emissions were below 1 mg m(-2) h(-1), and the summertime emissions about 3.5 mg m(-2) h(-1). The water table depth did have any clear effect on methane emissions. During most of the year the emission depended on the temperature of peat below the water table. However, during the high and late summer the emission was independent on peat temperature as well. No diurnal cycle of methane flux was found. The total annual emission from the Siikaneva site was 12.6 g m(-2). The emissions of the snow free period contributed 91% to the annual emission. The emission pulse during the snow melting period was clearly detectable but of minor importance adding only less than 3% to the annual emission. Over 20% of the carbon assimilated during the year as carbon dioxide was emitted as methane. Thus methane emission is an important component of the carbon balance of the Siikaneva fen. This indicates need of taking methane into account when studying carbon balances of northern fen ecosystems.

AB Coastal plains are amongst the most densely populated areas in the world. Many coastal peatlands are drained to create arable land. This is not without consequences; physical compaction of peat and its degradation by oxidation lead to subsidence, and oxidation also leads to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study complements existing studies by quantifying total land subsidence and associated CO2 respiration over the past millennium in the Dutch coastal peatlands, to gain insight into the consequences of cultivating coastal peatlands over longer timescales. Results show that the peat volume loss was 19.8 km(3), which lowered the Dutch coastal plain by 1.9 m on average, bringing most of it below sea level. At least 66 % of the volume reduction is the result of drainage, and 34 % was caused by the excavation and subsequent combustion of peat. The associated CO2 respiration is equivalent to a global atmospheric CO2 concentration increase of similar to 0.39 ppmv. Cultivation of coastal peatlands can turn a carbon sink into a carbon source. If the path taken by the Dutch would be followed worldwide, there will be double trouble: globally significant carbon emissions and increased flood risk in a globally important human habitat. The effects would be larger than the historic ones because most of the cumulative Dutch subsidence and peat loss was accomplished with much less efficient techniques than those available now.

AB Due to their unique flora, hydrology and environmental characteristics, peatlands are precious and specific habitats for microorganisms and microscopic animals. Their microbial network structure and their biomass are crucial for peatland carbon cycling, through primary production, as well as decomposition and mineralization of organic matter. Wetlands are one of the ecosystems most at risk from anthropogenic activities and climate change. Most recent scenarios of climate change for Central Europe predict an increase in air temperature and a decrease in annual precipitation. These changes may disturb the biodiversity of aquatic organisms, and the peat carbon sink. Considering the above climatic scenarios, we aimed to: i) assess the response of microbial community biomass to warming and reduced precipitation through the lens of a manipulative experiment in a peatland ecosystem ii) predict how global warming might affect microbial biodiversity on peatlands exposed to warmer temperatures and decreased precipitation conditions. Additionally, we wanted to identify ecological indicators of warming among microorganisms living in Sphagnum peatland. The result of a manipulative experiment carried out at Rzecin peatland (W Poland) suggested that the strongest reduction in microbial biomass was observed in heated plots and plots where heating was combined with a reduction of precipitation. The most pronounced changes were observed in the case of the very abundant mixotrophic testate amoeba Hyalosphenia papilio and cyanobacteria. Shifts in the Sphagnum microbial network can be used as an early warning indicator of peatland warming, especially a decrease in the biomass of important phototrophic microbes living on the Sphagnum capitula, e.g. Hyalosphenia papilio.

AB Globally, fires are a major source of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere, occurring on a seasonal cycle and with substantial interannual variability. To understand past trends and variability in sources and sinks of terrestrial carbon, we need quantitative estimates of global fire distributions. Here we introduce an updated version of the Fire Including Natural and Agricultural Lands model, version 2 (FINAL.2), modified to include multiday burning and enhanced fire spread rate in forest crowns. We demonstrate that the improved model reproduces the interannual variability and spatial distribution of fire emissions reported in present-day remotely sensed inventories. We use FINAL.2 to simulate historical (post-1700) fires and attribute past fire trends and variability to individual drivers: land use and land cover change, population growth, and lightning variability. Global fire emissions of carbon increase by about 10% between 1700 and 1900, reaching a maximum of 3.4 Pg C yr(-1) in the 1910s, followed by a decrease to about 5% below year 1700 levels by 2010. The decrease in emissions from the 1910s to the present day is driven mainly by land use change, with a smaller contribution from increased fire suppression due to increased human population and is largest in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Interannual variability of global fire emissions is similar in the present day as in the early historical period, but present-day wildfires would be more variable in the absence of land use change.

AB Permafrost peatlands store large amounts of carbon potentially vulnerable to decomposition. However, the fate of that carbon in a changing climate remains uncertain in models due to complex interactions among hydrological, biogeochemical, microbial, and plant processes. In this study, we estimated effects of climate forcing biases present in global climate reanalysis products on carbon cycle predictions at a thawing permafrost peatland in subarctic Sweden. The analysis was conducted with a comprehensive biogeochemical model (ecosys) across a permafrost thaw gradient encompassing intact permafrost palsa with an ice core and a shallow active layer, partly thawed bog with a deeper active layer and a variable water table, and fen with a water table close to the surface, each with distinct vegetation and microbiota. Using in situ observations to correct local cold and wet biases found in the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3) climate reanalysis forcing, we demonstrate good model performance by comparing predicted and observed carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchanges, thaw depth, and water table depth. The simulations driven by the bias-corrected climate suggest that the three peatland types currently accumulate carbon from the atmosphere, although the bog and fen sites can have annual positive radiative forcing impacts due to their higher CH4 emissions. Our simulations indicate that projected precipitation increases could accelerate CH4 emissions from the palsa area, even without further degradation of palsa permafrost. The GSWP3 cold and wet biases for this site significantly alter simulation results and lead to erroneous active layer depth (ALD) and carbon budget estimates. Biases in simulated CO2 and CH4 exchanges from biased climate forcing are as large as those among the thaw stages themselves at a landscape scale across the examined permafrost thaw gradient. Future studies should thus not only focus on changes in carbon budget associated with morphological changes in thawing permafrost, but also recognize the effects of climate forcing uncertainty on carbon cycling.

AB Most inverse atmospheric models report considerable uptake of carbon dioxide in Europe's terrestrial biosphere. In contrast, carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems increase at a much smaller rate, with carbon gains in forests and grassland soils almost being offset by carbon losses from cropland and peat soils. Accounting for non-carbon dioxide carbon transfers that are not detected by the atmospheric models and for carbon dioxide fluxes bypassing the ecosystem carbon stocks considerably reduces the gap between the small carbon-stock changes and the larger carbon dioxide uptake estimated by atmospheric models. The remaining difference could be because of missing components in the stock-change approach, as well as the large uncertainty in both methods. With the use of the corrected atmosphere- and land-based estimates as a dual constraint, we estimate a net carbon sink between 135 and 205 teragrams per year in Europe's terrestrial biosphere, the equivalent of 7 to 12% of the 1995 anthropogenic carbon emissions.

AB This study reports the annual carbon balance of a drained riparian fen under two-cut or three-cut managements of festulolium and tall fescue. CO2 fluxes measured with closed chambers were partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) for modelling according to environmental factors (light and temperature) and canopy reflectance (ratio vegetation index, RVI). Methodological assessments were made of (i) GPP models with or without temperature functions (Ft) to adjust GPP constraints imposed by low temperature (< 10 degrees C) and (ii) ER models with RVI or GPP parameters as biomass proxies. The sensitivity of the models was also tested on partial datasets including only alternate measurement campaigns and on datasets only from the crop growing period. Use of Ft in GPP models effectively corrected GPP overestimation in cold periods, and this approach was used throughout. Annual fluxes obtained with ER models including RVI or GPP parameters were similar, and also annual GPP and ER fluxes obtained with full and partial datasets were similar. Annual CO2 fluxes and biomass yield were not significantly different in the crop/management combinations although the individual collars (n = 12) showed some variations in GPP (-1818 to -2409g CO2-C m(-2)), ER (1071 to 1738g CO2-C m(-2)), net ecosystem exchange (NEE, -669 to -949g CO2-C m(-2)) and biomass yield (556 to 1044g CO2-C m(-2)). Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB), as the sum of NEE and biomass carbon export, was only slightly negative to positive in all crop/management combinations. NECBs, interpreted as emission factors, tended to favour the least biomass producing systems as the best management options in relation to climate saving carbon balances. Yet, considering the down-stream advantages of biomass for fossil fuel replacement, yield-scaled carbon fluxes are suggested to be given additional considerations for comparison of management options in terms of atmospheric impact.

AB Geomorphological controls and catchment sediment characteristics control the formation of floodplains and affect their capacity to sequester carbon. Organic carbon stored in floodplains is typically a product of pedogenic development between periods of mineral sediment deposition. However, in organically-dominated upland catchments with a high sediment load, eroded particulate organics may also be fluvially deposited with potential for storage and/or oxidation. Understanding the redistribution of terrestrial carbon laterally, beyond the bounds of river channels is important, especially in eroding peatland systems where fluvial particulate organic carbon exports are often assumed to be oxidised. Floodplains have the potential to be both carbon cycling hotspots and areas of sequestration. Understanding of the interaction of carbon cycling and the sediment cascade through floodplain systems is limited. This paper examines the formation of highly organic floodplains downstream of heavily eroded peatlands in the Peak District, UK. Reconstruction of the history of the floodplains suggests that they have formed in response to periods of erosion of organic soils upstream. We present a novel approach to calculating a carbon stock within a floodplain, using XRF and radiograph data recorded during Itrax core scanning of sediment cores. This carbon stock is extrapolated to the catchment scale, to assess the importance of these floodplains in the storage and cycling of organic carbon in this area. The carbon stock estimate for the floodplains across the contributing catchments is between 3482-13460 tonnes, equating on an annualised basis to 0.8-4.5% of the modern-day POC flux. Radiocarbon analyses of bulk organic matter in floodplain sediments revealed that a substantial proportion of organic carbon was associated with re-deposited peat and has been used as a tool for organic matter source determination. The average age of these samples (3010 years BP) is substantially older than Infrared Stimulated Luminesence dating which demonstrated that the floodplains formed between 430 and 1060 years ago. Our data suggest that floodplains are an integral part of eroding peatland systems, acting as both significant stores of aged and eroded organic carbon and as hotspots of carbon turnover.

AB Across the Arctic, the net ecosystem carbon (C) balance of tundra ecosystems is highly uncertain due to substantial temporal variability of C fluxes and to landscape heterogeneity. We modeled both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes for the dominant land cover types in a similar to 100-km(2) sub-Arctic tundra region in northeast European Russia for the period of 2006-2015 using process-based biogeochemical models. Modeled net annual CO2 fluxes ranged from --300 g C m(-2) year(-1) [net uptake] in a willow fen to 3 g Cm-2 year(-1) [net source] in dry lichen tundra. Modeled annual CH4 emissions ranged from -0.2 to 22.3 g Cm-2 year(-1) at a peat plateau site and a willow fen site, respectively. Interannual variability over the decade was relatively small (20%-25%) in comparison with variability among the land cover types (150%). Using high-resolution land cover classification, the region was a net sink of atmospheric CO2 across most land cover types but a net source of CH4 to the atmosphere due to high emissions from permafrost-free fens. Using a lower resolution for land cover classification resulted in a 20%-65% underestimation of regional CH4 flux relative to high-resolution classification and smaller (10%) overestimation of regional CO2 uptake due to the underestimation of wetland area by 60%. The relative fraction of uplands versus wetlands was key to determining the net regional C balance at this and other Arctic tundra sites because wetlands were hot spots for C cycling in Arctic tundra ecosystems.

TI Carbon budget response of an agriculturally used fen to different soil
   moisture conditions
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The agricultural use of peatlands usually requires drainage, thereby transforming these organic soils from a net carbon sink into a net source. The Seeland region of Switzerland is characterised by fens that have been intensively used for agriculture for 150 years. Our site is a degraded fen with a remaining peat layer of 60 cm that had been used as cropland until 2009. In connection to a nature protection project it has been managed as extensive permanent grassland since then. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was determined for two years (2015-2016). For this purpose, the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and CH4 fluxes were measured by eddy covariance, and the carbon removed by harvest was quantified. Our degraded fen site was found to be a net carbon source of 477 +/- 73g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 434 +/- 51 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Annual CH4 emissions were marginal in both years with 0.4 +/- 0.8 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) (2015) and 0.7 +/- 0.7 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1) (2016). In contrast to NECB, the NEE was considerably higher in 2015 than in 2016 (308 +/- 71 g C m(-2) yr(-1) vs 117 +/- 39 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The year 2015 was characterised by partial flooding of the grassland, followed by a dry and hot summer leading to lower CO2 uptake due to reduced growth, which was reflected in lower harvest compared to 2016. Thus, the short-term plant-induced carbon fluxes were altered, whereas total soil carbon loss remained rather constant. This was verified by an intra site comparison between the flooded and non-flooded part in 2015. Our results indicate that the soil carbon loss of this highly degraded peatland with a shallow peat layer is relatively moderate and hardly influenced by interannual weather variations.

AB We carried out a verification exercise of the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) carbon accounting model through the use of a reconstructed data set of forest growth and disturbances spanning it 71 year period (1928-1998) and encompassing a 62 km(2) landscape of boreal forest in eastern Canada. Overall, results show that yield curve simulations using CBM-CFS3 underestimate realized net biomass accrual by 10% in undisturbed stands. The bias in disturbed stands may be slightly larger. Errors linked to the estimation of the initial 1928 merchantable volume and biomass through the operational forest photointerpretation and inventory procedure may be the largest single cause of the bias. The local application of regionally parameterized yield curves may also be at fault. It is unlikely that long-term trends in climate or atmospheric composition may have generated such bias. Analyses of changes in specific carbon pools and comparisons made with results from a similar exercise carried out in a Pacific coastal forest show a small relative impact on total carbon from forest management activities in the absence of natural disturbances.

AB Comprehensive and credible peatland carbon budgets, needed for global carbon accounting, must include lateral aquatic organic carbon export. Here, we quantify aquatic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export for an Atlantic bog in subarctic Norway, the Andoya peatland, and test for sensitivity to climatic drivers. Hydrology, DOC concentrations and DOC export were simulated for 2000-2013 using the process-based catchment model Integrated Catchments model for Carbon (INCA-C), calibrated to site-specific water chemistry and hydrology (2011-2014) using readily-available data on temperature, precipitation and seasalt deposition. Measured streamwater DOC declined under seasalt episodes and was strongly positively related to temperature. Model calibrations successfully reproduced the water balance, variation in runoff (R-2 = 0.67; Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency NS = 0.67) and DOC concentrations (R-2 = 0.85; NS = 0.84). The most sensitive model parameters related to temperature-sensitivity of DOC production and DOC (de)sorption sensitivity to seasalts. Model uncertainty related to parameter space was similar to interannual variation in DOC export. Mean annual modelled DOC export was 7.2 +/- A 0.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), roughly 35 % of the net land-atmospheric CO2 exchange at Andoya from 2009 to 2012 (estimated elsewhere). Current and antecedent mean temperature and precipitation were strong drivers of seasonal modelled DOC export, implying that warmer and wetter summers will lead to more DOC export. Evaluation of similar climate impacts on net peatland carbon accumulation requires additional exploration of the climate-sensitivity of land-atmosphere fluxes of CO2 and methane. Process-based models are valuable tools to account for lateral DOC exports in carbon balances of northern peatlands, especially where long-term monitoring data are lacking.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost organic carbon decomposition in lakes and rivers can accelerate global warming. We used radiocarbon (C-14) measurements to determine the predominant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and methane (CH4) in five thermokarst lakes and three rivers in an area of widespread permafrost degradation in Northern Quebec to assess contributions from thawing permafrost and other old carbon (fixed before CE 1950) reservoirs. We compared emission pathways (dissolved gas and ebullition), seasons (summer and winter), and surface soil type (mineral and peat soils). Modern carbon (fixed after CE 1950) was the dominant source of DOC, DIC, and CH4 of non-peatland aquatic systems, while POC and sediment carbon were predominantly fixed in the last millennia. In the peatland systems, modern and permafrost carbon were important sources of DOC, lake DIC, lake ebullition CO2, and lake dissolved CH4. In contrast, POC, lake ebullition CH4, and river DIC were dominated by millennial-old carbon. In winter, the C-14 age of DOC, DIC, and POC in the peatland lakes increased, but the C-14 age of dissolved CH4 did not change. Our results point to a clearly older overall carbon source for ebullition CH4 relative to dissolved CH4 in the peatland lakes but not the non-peatland lakes. The younger ages of dissolved CH4 and DIC relative to DOC and POC in all lakes suggest that recent primary productivity strongly influences the large total lake CH4 and CO2 emissions in this area, as diffusion fluxes greatly exceed ebullition fluxes.

AB High-resolution records of greenhouse gas concentrations from the Law Dome Antarctic ice core show small fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 and CH4, including a 10 ppmv decrease in CO2 and a 50 ppbv increase in CH4 during the Little Ice Age. Explanations for the biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchanges that caused these fluctuations, and their impacts on global climate, are lacking. We produce here a wetland index derived from the North American Pollen Database and show that for most of the past two millennia, this index is negatively correlated (antiphase) with atmospheric CO2 levels measured in the Law Dome ice core. Our analysis indicates the potential for global wetlands to act as carbon sinks, contributing to small fluctuations in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and thereby influencing submillennial-scale climatic change. Although our wetland index-CO2 relationship is statistically significant, the relationship between our wetland index-CH4 curve is not, possibly due to the confounding influence of wildfires on CH4.

AB Quantifying marine sedimentary carbon stocks is key to improving our understanding of long-term storage of carbon in the coastal ocean and to further constraining the global carbon cycle. Here we present a methodological approach which combines seismic geophysics and geochemical measurements to quantitatively estimate the total stock of carbon held within marine sediment. Through the application of this methodology to Loch Sunart, a fjord on the west coast of Scotland, we have generated the first full sedimentary carbon inventory for a fjordic system. The sediments of Loch Sunart hold 26.9 +/- 0.5 Mt of carbon split between 11.5 +/- 0.2 and 15.0 +/- 0.4 Mt of organic and inorganic carbon respectively. These new quantitative estimates of carbon stored in coastal sediments are significantly higher than previous estimates. Through an area-normalised comparison to adjacent Scottish peatland carbon stocks, we have determined that these mid-latitude fjords are significantly more effective as carbon stores than their terrestrial counterparts. This initial work supports the concept that fjords are important environments for the burial and long-term storage of carbon and therefore should be considered and treated as unique environments within the global carbon cycle.

AB Climate change projections indicate increases in CO2 emissions and DOC release from peatlands, thereby potentially transforming them from sinks to carbon sources. The individual effects of abiotic and biotic factors on peatland carbon exports and the interactions among all these factors are still poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a field study over two years in a peatland complex by selecting four habitats differing in their dominant vegetation (shrub, grass, sedge and moss) in order to assess the links between abiotic and biotic factors and carbon release at each habitat. Accounting for the wide variability across habitats allowed us to examine the direct and indirect effects of abiotic and biotic factors on carbon cycling at the ecosystem level (i.e. the whole peatland complex). Results showed that the habitats dominated by vascular plants had the highest microbial and above-ground plant biomass, as well as the highest values of Acari and Collembola biomass, whereas Enchytraeidae biomass was dominant in the moss habitat. Furthermore, at ecosystem level, the SEM explained 75% of the total soil respiration variation and 33% of the DOC variation. Accordingly, soil respiration was directly linked to enchytraeid biomass, with these invertebrates being positively related to soil moisture. In contrast, both soil temperature and soil moisture had direct effects on microbial and Acari biomass, and the interaction between Acari biomass and below-ground plant biomass was responsible for DOC release. These findings provide new insights into the role of soil biota in carbon dynamics in peatlands, by showing that the direct effects of abiotic factors on biotic communities (both plants and soil organisms) determine how much carbon is lost from these systems (either as CO2 e or DOC).

AB Wetlands are one of the most significant natural sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. They emit CH4 because decomposition of soil organic matter in waterlogged anoxic conditions produces CH4, in addition to carbon dioxide (CO2). Production of CH4 and how much of it escapes to the atmosphere depend on a multitude of environmental drivers. Models simulating the processes leading to CH4 emissions are thus needed for upscaling observations to estimate present CH4 emissions and for producing scenarios of future atmospheric CH4 concentrations. Aiming at a CH4 model that can be added to models describing peatland carbon cycling, we composed a model called HIMMELI that describes CH4 build-up in and emissions from peatland soils. It is not a full peatland carbon cycle model but it requires the rate of anoxic soil respiration as input. Driven by soil temperature, leaf area index (LAI) of aerenchymatous peat-land vegetation, and water table depth (WTD), it simulates the concentrations and transport of CH4, CO2, and oxygen (O-2) in a layered one-dimensional peat column. Here, we present the HIMMELI model structure and results of tests on the model sensitivity to the input data and to the description of the peat column (peat depth and layer thickness), and demonstrate that HIMMELI outputs realistic fluxes by comparing modeled and measured fluxes at two peatland sites. As HIMMELI describes only the CH4-related processes, not the full carbon cycle, our analysis revealed mechanisms and dependencies that may remain hidden when testing CH4 models connected to complete peatland carbon models, which is usually the case. Our results indicated that (1) the model is flexible and robust and thus suitable for different environments; (2) the simulated CH4 emissions largely depend on the prescribed rate of anoxic respiration; (3) the sensitivity of the total CH4 emission to other input variables is mainly mediated via the concentrations of dissolved gases, in particular, the O-2 concentrations that affect the CH4 production and oxidation rates; (4) with given input respiration, the peat column description does not significantly affect the simulated CH4 emissions in this model version.

AB Northern peatlands are Substantial sinks of carbon (C), yet the sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from peatlands are largely unknown. Since the relationship between roots and peat in C cycling is important, vascular plants growing on the surface of peat deposits should influence CO2 efflux from the peat surface and the overall C balance in peatlands. In our study, 30-cm peat cores were removed from an ombrotrophic bog in boreal, continental western Canada. Surface vegetation in the cores remained intact and included a continuous bryophyte cover dominated by Sphagnum fuscum. In addition, some cores were collected such that either ericaceous shrubs (Ledum groenlandicum) or sedges (Eriophorum vaginatum) were present. We investigated how the presence of each vegetation type influenced soil respiration and the microbial mineralization of root exudates using a pulse C-14 labeling of vegetation in the intact peat cores. The role of root biomass and toot respiration in CO2 emission and C allocation was quantified for each type of vegetation and compared through both measurement and modeling. Our results show that vascular plants contributed 35-57% of total CO2 efflux from the peat surface, primarily derived from rhizosphere processes, including root respiration as well as microbial mineralization of root exudates. The mineralization of root exudates contributed 14-53 mu mol C-CO(2)(.)m(-2).d(-1) (17-24% of total) to CO2 efflux, depending on vegetation type and moisture conditions. The type of vegetation present did not influence the total amount of photosynthetic fixation over the course of the study, but did affect how C was allocated within and between both the aboveground and belowground components of the peat column.

AB . The effects of different CO2 concentrations in the acrotelm pore water on the development of Sphagnum magellanicum monoliths grown in wet conditions in the laboratory are reported here.
   . Decomposition processes result in much higher CO2 concentrations in bog acrotelms than atmospheric concentrations. We therefore hypothesized that this substrate-derived carbon provides an important carbon source for Sphagnum.
   . S. magellanicum hummocks developed only when CO2 concentrations in the acrotelm water were high. Plants in the low CO2 treatment appeared to be carbon-limited; they had increased nutrient concentrations and decreased ratios of carbon to other nutrients. Chlorophyll concentrations were much higher in these plants, probably allowing them to harvest more CO2 but the allocation of carbon to structural tissues was lower, resulting in weak stems that were unable to remain upright. As a result of carbon-limitation, net biomass and height increases of the monoliths were much lower in the low CO2 treatment.
   . Results indicate that, at least in wet conditions, atmospheric CO2 alone is not sufficient to enable S. magellanicum to develop its normal vertical growth pattern. We conclude that the role of substrate-derived CO2 as a carbon source for Sphagna is underestimated and requires reconsideration.

AB Rooting in tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa Andr.) remains the most difficult challenge in the tissue culture of this woody ornamental plant. In a bid to increase rooting ability of tree peony plants in vitro, several abiotic factors were assessed. Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) concentration, carbon source, substrate, and light source affected the root induction ability of tree peony cv. 'Wu Long Peng Sheng'. Without IBA, no roots formed. At 4 mg l(-1) IBA, all rooting parameters were highest. When plantlets were cultured under light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) on rooting medium, rooting percent-age on rockwool was higher than on Gellan gum. However, rooting percentage was higher under heat fluorescent lamps than under LEDs or CCFLs, independent of the medium substrate. Sucrose resulted in higher rooting ability than CO2-enrichment under any light source; moreover, CO2-enrichment appeared to have a detrimental effect on rooting percentage. Rooting was better under heterotrophic than under photoautotrophic conditions. Rooting of tree peony was successfully achieved under various conditions, which will greatly benefit the micropropagation of this difficult-to-root tree.

AB The nature and extent to which hydrological changes induced by the Asian summer monsoon affected key biogeochemical processes remain poorly defined. This study explores the relationship between peatland drying and carbon cycling on centennial timescales in central China using lipid biomarkers. The difference between peat n-alkane delta H-2 and a nearby stalagmite delta O-18 record reveals that intervals of prominent peatland drying occurred during the mid-Holocene. Synchronous with these drier conditions, leaf wax delta C-13 values show large negative excursions, with the utilization of CO2 respired from the peatland subsurface for plant photosynthesis being a possible mechanism. Crucially, successive drying events appear to have had a cumulative impact on the susceptibility of peat carbon stores to climate change. Concurrently, bacterially derived hopane delta C-13 values suggest the occurrence of enhanced methane oxidation during the drier periods. Collectively, these observations expand our understanding of how respiration and degradation of peat are enhanced during drying events.

AB The CO2 dynamics were measured in an organic soil in eastern Finland during the growing season and wintertime, and the annual CO2 balance was calculated for plots where barley or grass was grown. During the summer, the CO2 dynamics were measured by transparent and opaque chambers using a portable infrared gas analyser for the CO2 analyses. During the winter, the CO2 release was measured by opaque chambers analysing the samples in the laboratory with a gas chromatograph. Statistical response functions for CO2 dynamics were constructed to evaluate the annual CO2 exchange from the climatic data. The net CO2 exchange was calculated for every hour in the snow-free season. The carbon balance varied extensively depending on the weather conditions, and type and phenology of vegetation. During the growing season, the grassland was a net source while the barley field was a net sink for CO2. However, both soils were net sources for CO2 when autumn, winter and spring were included also. The annual CO2 emissions from the grassland and barley soil were 750 g CO2-C m(-2) and 400 g CO2-C m(-2), respectively. The carbon accumulated in root and shoot biomass during the growing season was 330 g m(-2) for grass and 520 g m(-2) for barley. The C in the aboveground plant biomass ranged from 43 to 47% of the carbon fixed in photosynthesis (P-G) and the proportion of C in the root biomass was 10% of the carbon fixed in photosynthesis. The bare soils had 10-60% higher net CO2 emission than the vegetated soils. These results indicate that the carbon balance of organic soils is affected by the characteristics of the prevailing plant cover. The dry summer of 1997 may have limited the growth of grass in the late summer thus reducing photosynthesis, which could be one reason for the high CO2 release from this grass field.

AB Boreal and subarctic peatlands today represent a large global carbon (C) reservoir. Existing models that describe organic matter accumulation in peatlands over thousands of years are inadequate for predicting short-term responses to changing climate. This paper develops a new, empirically based model that estimates net primary production (NPP) and depth-dependent decay rates (exponential decay k values) of near-surface peat. Application of the model to three sites in boreal Alberta indicates that today the sites are net sinks for atmospheric C at rates of 34-52 g C.m(-2).yr(-1). Even without climate change, within 80-160 years, these sites will attain steady-state conditions with no further net C accumulation. Climate change scenarios in which NPP or k values are allowed to change gradually and linearly (at 0.1% per year) affect net C sequestration. Any scenario of decreasing NPP or increasing k values results in the peatlands switching from net sinks to net sources of atmospheric C within the next 20-62 years. Regional C balance of the peatlands in boreal, continental, western Canada will at best diminish in terms of strength of an atmospheric C sink and may well shift to becoming a source of atmospheric C. Shifts from sinks to sources of atmospheric C may occur within time frames that are similar in magnitude to the anticipated doubling of atmospheric CO2 by the middle of the 21st century.

AB CO2 emissions from preindustrial land-use change (LUC) are subject to large uncertainties. Although atmospheric CO2 records suggest only a small land carbon (C) source since 5,000 y before present (5 kyBP), the concurrent C sink by peat buildup could mask large early LUC emissions. Here, we combine updated continuous peat C reconstructions with the land C balance inferred from double deconvolution analyses of atmospheric CO2 and delta C-13 at different temporal scales to investigate the terrestrial C budget of the Holocene and the last millennium and constrain LUC emissions. LUC emissions are estimated with transient model simulations for diverging published scenarios of LU area change and shifting cultivation. Our results reveal a large terrestrial no C source after the Mid-Holocene (66 +/- 25 PgC at 7-5 kyBP and 115 +/- 27 PgC at 5-3 kyBP). Despite high simulated per-capita CO2 emissions from LUC in early phases of agricultural development, humans emerge as a driver with dominant global C cycle impacts only in the most recent three millennia. Sole anthropogenic causes for particular variations in the CO2 record (similar to 20 ppm rise after 7 kyBP and similar to 10 ppm fall between 1500 CE and 1600 CE) are not supported. This analysis puts a strong constraint on preindustrial vs. industrial-era LUC emissions and suggests that upper-end scenarios for the extent of agricultural expansion before 1850 CE are not compatible with the C budget thereafter.

AB Recent accelerated decay of discontinuous permafrost at the Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden has been attributed to increased temperature and snow depth, and has caused expansion of wet minerotrophic areas leading to significant changes in carbon cycling in the mire. In order to track these changes through time and evaluate potential forcing mechanisms, this paper analyses a peat succession and a lake sediment sequence from within the mire, providing a record for the last 100 years, and compares these with monitored climate and active layer thickness data. The peat core was analysed for testate amoebae to reconstruct changes in peatland surface moisture conditions and water table fluctuations. The lake sediment core was analysed by near infrared spectroscopy to infer changes in the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the lake-water, and changes in delta C-13 and C, N and delta N-15 to track changes in the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool and the influence of diagenetic effects on sediment organic matter, respectively. Results showed that major shifts towards increased peat surface moisture and TOC concentration of the lake-water occurred around 1980, one to two decades earlier than a temperature driven increase in active layer thickness. Comparison with monitored temperature and precipitation from a nearby climate station indicates that this change in peat surface moisture is related to June-September (JJAS) precipitation and that the increase in lake-water TOC concentration reflects an increase in total annual precipitation. A significant depletion in C-13 of sediment organic matter in the early 1980s probably reflects the effect of a single or a few consecutive years with anomalously high summer precipitation, resulting in elevated DIC content of the lake water, predominantly originating from increased export and subsequent respiration of organic carbon from the mire. Based on these results, it was not possible to link proxy data obtained on peat and lake-sediment records directly to permafrost decay. Instead our data indicate that increased precipitation and anomalously high rainfall during summers had a significant impact on the mire and the adjacent lake ecosystem. We therefore propose that effects of increased precipitation should be considered when evaluating potential forcing mechanisms of recent changes in carbon cycling in the subarctic.

AB Globally, peatlands play an important role in the carbon (C) cycle. High water level is a key factor in maintaining C storage in peatlands, but water levels are vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. This review examines literature related to the effects of water level alteration on C cycling in peatlands to summarize new ideas and uncertainties emerging in this field. Peatland ecosystems maintain their function by altering plant community structure to adapt to changing water levels. Regarding primary production, woody plants are more productive in unflooded, well-aerated conditions, whileSphagnummosses are more productive in wetter conditions. The responses of sedges to water level alteration are species-specific. While peat decomposition is faster in unflooded, well aerated conditions, increased plant production may counteract the C loss induced by increased ecosystem respiration (ER) for a period of time. In contrast, rising water table maintains anaerobic conditions and enhances the role of the peatland as a C sink. Nevertheless, changes in DOC flux during water level fluctuation is complicated and depends on the interactions of flooding with environment. Notably, vegetation also plays a role in C flux but particular species vary in their ability to sequester and transport C. Bog ecosystems have a greater resilience to water level alteration than fens, due to differences in biogeochemical responses to hydrology. The full understanding of the role of peatlands in global C cycling deserves much more study due to uncertainties of vegetation feedbacks, peat-water interactions, microbial mediation of vegetation, wildfire, and functional responses after hydrologic restoration.

AB UK peatlands are affected by severe gully erosion with consequent impacts on ecosystem services from these areas. Incision into the peat can damage the vegetation and hydrology and lead to increases in carbon loss and sediment transfer downstream. Gullies represent then a conduit for and a hotspot of carbon loss but the relatively high water tables of gullies have meant that they have been identified as areas with a high restoration potential because of easily restored peat-forming conditions. This study uses a series of gully sites, subject to different restoration interventions, to investigate differences in carbon pathways (DOC, CO2) and hydrology between restoration strategies and gully position. The results show that the position within the gully (interfluve, gully side, or gully floor) does not significantly affect water quality but that it plays a significant role in CO2 exchange. Gully floors are areas of high photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration, though net ecosystem exchange is not significantly different across the gully. While gully position plays a role in the cycling of some carbon species, this study highlights the importance of vegetation as a key control on carbon cycling.

AB Wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle and are sources and sinks for the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). We provide an in situ study on variability of daytime CH4 emissions and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) from a permanently submerged, Carex rostrata dominated Swiss alpine fen over the snow-free period (June-October). Flux chamber measurements were combined with analyses of above-ground biomass and physico-chemical pore water properties. The fen was a net daytime CH4 source throughout the snow-free period, and emissions varied significantly between the sampling dates, ranging from 3.1 +/- 0.9 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in October to 8.0 +/- 2.9 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in August. The fen was generally a daytime sink for CO2, and net CO2 emission was only observed in late October. Variations in NEE were more pronounced than variations in CH4 emissions, but both fluxes correlated with changes in green C. rostrata biomass and subsurface temperatures. Methane and CO2 pore water concentrations also varied significantly over the snow-free period, decreasing and increasing, respectively. These variations were linked to the development of biomass, but CH4 emissions and NEE were not correlated with the respective pore water concentrations.

AB Waste plastic and methane emissions are two anthropogenic by-products exacerbating environmental pollution. Methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) hold the key to solving these problems simultaneously by utilising otherwise wasted methane gas as carbon source and accumulating the carbon as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable plastic polymer. Here we present the isolation and characterisation of two novel Methylocystis strains with the ability to produce up to 55.7 +/- 1.9% poly-3-hydroxybutyrate of cell dry weight when grown on methane from different waste sources such as landfill and anaerobic digester gas. Methylocystis rosea BRCS1 isolated from a recreational lake and Methylocystis parvus BRCS2 isolated from a bog were whole genome sequenced using PacBio and Illumina genome sequencing technologies. In addition to potassium nitrate, these strains were also shown to grow on ammonium chloride, glutamine and ornithine as nitrogen source. Growth of Methylocystis parvus BRCS2 on Nitrate Mineral Salt (NMS) media with 0.1% methanol vapor as carbon source was demonstrated. The genetic tractability by conjugation was also determined with conjugation efficiencies up to 2.8x10(-2) and 1.8x10(-2) for Methylocystis rosea BRCS1 and Methylocystis parvus BRCS2 respectively using a plasmid with ColE1 origin of replication. Finally, we show that Methylocystis species can produce considerable amounts of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate on waste methane sources without impaired growth, a proof of concept which opens doors to their use in integrated bio-facilities like landfills and anaerobic digesters.

AB We report the irradiation of titanium dioxide suspensions (Hombikat UV100 and P25) under different conditions regarding the source of dissolved organic carbon (2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and brown water from a bog lake), and with and without added copper(II) ions. In contrast to P25 suspensions, we found no significant bromoform formation in Hombikat UV100 suspensions, likely because bromoform is degraded faster with Hombikat UV100 than with P25, preventing accumulation. In the case of P25 suspensions, the presence of 10 mu M of added Cu(2+) significantly inhibited bromoform formation. Bromoform was the only measurable trihalomethane (THM), even in the presence of 250 mg L(-1) chloride ions. The concentrations of formed THM were below the limits for drinking water under all investigated experimental conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the soil carbon cycle. The effects of a field-scale summer drought manipulation on extracellular litter and soil phenol oxidase activity, soluble phenolic compounds and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were examined for an upland Calluna heathland on a peaty podsol in North Wales. Litter and organic soil phenol oxidase activity was found to be positively correlated with moisture content. Thus in shallow organic soils, which are sensitive to drying during periods of low rainfall, drought may inhibit soil phenol oxidase activity as a result of water limitations. The release of soluble phenolic compounds and DOC from the droughted plots was found to be lowered during the drought period and elevated outside of the drought period. It is hypothesized that these changes may be a result of the reduced ability of extracellular phenol oxidases to process recalcitrant polyphenolic material under drought conditions. A drying incubation carried out with litter and soil cores from the same site suggests that extracellular phenol oxidase activity displays an optimal moisture level. This reconciled the observed water limitation of phenol oxidase activity at the heathland experimental site with previously observed stimulation of phenol oxidase activity by water table drawdown in deeper peats.

AB There is a limited understanding of the hydrological and microclimatic processes from drained, harvested, or restored peatlands, and by extension the nature of the carbon balance is uncertain. However, understanding the symbiotic processes governing water and gas exchange is essential to the development of appropriate management plans for peatland restoration. In this paper, we highlight and contrast the suite of processes governing the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon on natural, harvested, and restored peatlands. Evapotranspiration from harvested sites is important throughout the spring and summer, and is not greatly different from the adjacent natural bog. On cutover peatlands, strong capillary water movement compensates for the lack of vascular plants, which on the natural bog become increasingly important as the capillary water movement within drying Sphagnum decreases. Methane emissions from cutover bogs are an order of magnitude lower than in natural sites, however, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are approximately three times greater. Peatland restoration enhances CO2 sequestration, although restoration (at least in the short term) does not restore the net carbon sink function to that in natural bogs. A conceptual model highlighting these changes in the atmospheric exchange of water and carbon from a natural bog through drainage, harvesting, abandonment, and restoration is presented.

AB Rewetting by beaver is reported from many European peatlands and especially from Belarus, which harbours vast abandoned peat extraction sites and a large beaver population. We studied how vegetation and exchange rates of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) changed after beaver had rewetted an abandoned drained fen in Belarus. We selected three sites with different vegetation and water levels. One meadow site turned into a nutrient-poor lake that remained virtually free of living vascular plants, released CO2 and CH4, and was a moderate source of greenhouse gases (GHG). In another meadow site that became shallowly flooded, the died-off vegetation was quickly replaced by mire plant species and in the second year the site had already become a strong CO2 sink, a moderate CH4 source and, as a result, a strong carbon sink and a weak net GHG emitter. The third site was dominated by forbs that died after intermittent flooding and were only slowly and sparsely replaced by wetland species. This site was a strong source of CO2 and N2O. Beaver activity can restore a peatland's carbon sink and reduce GHG emissions. However, as for humaninduced rewetting, the outcome depends on starting conditions, position and constancy of the water level, and the time needed for establishment of peat forming vegetation.

   MOISTURE; DIOXIDE; FLOOR; DECOMPOSITION; PLANTATIONS
AB The amounts of carbon stored in soils and vegetation in Britain, and the potential of forestry to influence, whether soils act as sinks or sources, are discussed. Soils are estimated to contain c.22 X 10(9) t carbon, while the amount in vegetation including forests is only 115 X 10(6) t. Some 86 per cent of the soil carbon is present in pears and peaty-surfaced soils, mainly in north-west Britain. Soil carbon content is strongly related to climate and altitude. Conversion of lowland cultivated land to forest can result in carbon accumulation in soils, as it can following the planting of some uplands, but quantities appear to be small in relation to the amounts carbon released to the atmosphere through fossil fuel use. Forest felling may result in decreases in soil carbon store, due to soil disturbance and changes in microclimatic conditions, but several decades after reafforestation the carbon store may recover to near original levels. Shortening forest rotations may result in long-term declines in soil carbon store. The main concern is the potential for forestry to convert peats, which contain amounts of carbon equivalent to 100 years' fossil fuel use at 1988 levels and which are normally slow sinks for atmospheric carbon, into carbon sources returning it to the atmosphere. The possible impacts of forestry and global warming on rates of carbon loss from upland soils including peats are discussed.

AB Peatland ecosystems have been important global carbon sinks throughout the Holocene. Most of the research on peatland carbon budgets and effects of variable weather conditions has been done in Northern Hemisphere Sphagnum-dominated systems. Given their importance in other geographic and climatic regions, a better understanding of peatland carbon dynamics is needed across the spectrum of global peatland types. In New Zealand, much of the historic peatland area has been drained for agriculture but little is known about rates of carbon exchange and storage in unaltered peatland remnants that are dominated by the jointed wire rush, Empodisma robustum. We used eddy covariance to measure ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes and a water balance approach to estimate the sub-surface flux of dissolved organic carbon from the largest remaining raised peat bog in New Zealand, Kopuatai bog. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was estimated over four years, which included two drought summers, a relatively wet summer, and a meteorologically average summer. In all measurement years, the bog was a substantial sink for carbon, ranging from 134.7 to 216.9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), owing to the large annual net ecosystem production (161.8 to 244.9 gCO(2)-Cm-2 yr(-1)). Annual methane fluxes were large relative to most Northern Hemisphere peatlands (14.2 to 21.9 gCH(4)-Cm-2 yr(-1)), although summer and autumn emissions were highly sensitive to dry conditions, leading to very predictable seasonality according to water table position. The annual flux of dissolved organic carbon was similar in magnitude to methane emissions but less variable, ranging from 11.7 to 12.8 gCm(-2) yr(-1). Dry conditions experienced during late summer droughts led to significant reductions in annual carbon storage, which resulted nearly equally from enhanced ecosystem respiration due to lowered water tables and increased temperatures, and from reduced gross primary production due to vapor pressure deficit-related stresses to the vegetation. However, the net C uptake of Kopuatai bog during drought years was large relative to even the maximum reported NECB from Northern Hemisphere bogs. Furthermore, global warming potential fluxes indicated the bog was a strong sink for greenhouse gases in all years despite the relatively large annual methane emissions. Our results suggest that adaptations of E. robustum to dry conditions lead to a resilient peatland drought response of the NECB.

AB Mountains contain many small and fragmented peatlands within watersheds. As they are difficult to monitor, their role in the water and carbon cycle is often disregarded. This study aims to assess the stream organic carbon exports from a montane peatland and characterizes its contribution to the water chemistry in a headstream watershed. High frequency in situ monitoring of turbidity and fDOM were used to quantify respectively particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports at the inlet and outlet of a peatland over three years in a French Pyrenean watershed (1,343 m.a.s.l.). The DOC and POC signals are both highly dynamic, characterized by numerous short peaks lasting from a few hours to a few days. Forty-six percent of the exports occurred during 9% of the time corresponding to the highest flows monitored at the outlet. Despite its small area (3%) within the watershed, the peatland contributes at least 63% of the DOC export at the outlet. The specific DOC flux ranges from 16.1 +/- 0.4 to 34.6 +/- 1.5 g m(2) year(-1). POC contributes 17% of the total stream organic carbon exports from the watershed. As the frequency of extreme climatic events is expected to increase in the context of climate change, further studies should be conducted to understand the evolution of underestimated mountainous peatland carbon fluxes and their implication in the carbon cycle of headwaters.

AB Northern peatlands contain a considerable share of the terrestrial carbon pool, which will be affected by future climatic variability. Using the static chamber technique, we investigated ecosystem respiration and soil respiration over two growing seasons (2012 and 2013) in a Carex lasiocarpa-dominated peatland in the Sanjiang Plain in China. We synchronously monitored the environmental factors controlling CO2 fluxes. Ecosystem respiration during these two growing seasons ranged from 33.3 to 506.7mg CO2-Cm (2) h (1). Through step-wise regression, variations in soil temperature at 10 cm depth alone explained 73.7% of the observed variance in log(10)(ER). The mean Q(10) values ranged from 2.1 to 2.9 depending on the choice of depth where soil temperature was measured. The Q(10) value at the 10cm depth (2.9) appears to be a good representation for herbaceous peatland in the Sanjiang Plain when applying field-estimation based Q(10) values to current terrestrial ecosystem models due to the most optimized regression coefficient (63.2%). Soil respiration amounted to 57% of ecosystem respiration and played a major role in peatland carbon balance in our study. Emphasis on ecosystem respiration from temperate peatlands in the Sanjiang Plain will improve our basic understanding of carbon exchange between peatland ecosystem and the atmosphere.

AB Northern peatlands represent a globally important stock of soil carbon and have acted as a net sink of atmospheric CO2 throughout the Holocene. Disturbance for horticultural peat extraction disrupts ecosystem function and converts these ecosystems to large, persistent sources of carbon dioxide (CO2). This study investigates the effect of ecosystem-scale restoration on growing season CO2 exchange in a peatland by comparing a restored site to a neighboring nonrestored section for 1 year prerestoration (1999) and 3 years postrestoration (2000-2002). Prior to restoration, less than 23% of the site was vegetated, and it was a source of 245 g C m(-2) to the atmosphere during the growing season (May to early October). Following restoration, the water table remained deep, and soil moisture was significantly higher than the nonrestored section. By the third year postrestoration, vegetation covered 50% of the restored peatland. Moss covered 90% of this vegetated area. Vegetation productivity at the restored site was also enhanced with gross ecosystem photosynthesis under full light conditions significantly higher at the restored site at both moss and herbaceous plots by 2002. While this increase in vegetation productivity provided fresh substrate and resulted in higher CO2 production potential for restored site peat, ecosystem respiration was similar to or lower than that at the nonrestored site for both bare peat and vegetated areas because of the generally wetter site conditions resulting from restoration. By upscaling chamber CO2 exchange measurements to the ecosystem level, on the basis of the relative proportion of each surface cover type, we determined the site was a net sink of similar to 20 +/- 5 g C m(-2) during the growing season only 2 years postrestoration. Combining our results with previous work on CH4 emissions and dissolved organic carbon export, we suggest that this degraded peatland ecosystem will likely return to a net carbon sink in 6 to 10 years postrestoration.

AB The rapid and extensive expansion of emerald ash borer (EAB) in North America since 2002 may eliminate most existing ash stands, likely affecting critical ecosystem services associated with water and carbon cycling. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the coupled response of black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) wetland water tables, soil temperatures, and soil gas fluxes to an EAB infestation. Water table position, soil temperature, and soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes were monitored in nine depressional headwater black ash wetlands in northern Michigan. An EAB disturbance was simulated by girdling (girdle) or felling (ash-cut) all black ash trees with diameters greater than 2.5 cm within treated wetlands (n = 3 per treatment). Soil gas fluxes were sensitive to water table position, temperature, and disturbance. Soil CO2 fluxes were significantly higher, and high soil CH4 fluxes occurred more frequently in disturbed sites. Soil CH4 fluxes in ash-cut were marginally significantly higher than girdle during post-treatment, yet both were similar to control sites. The strong connection between depressional black ash wetland study sites and groundwater likely buffered the magnitude of disturbance-related impact on water tables and carbon cycling.

AB Aims The association of organic matter with iron (Fe-OM associations) is recognized as an important stabilization mechanism for soil organic matter. Our objective was to assess the factors regulating stabilization of soil organic matter by iron in various plant-dominated peatlands, and the role of laccase in the formation of Fe-OM associations. Methods We investigated Fe-bound OC content and related physicochemical and biochemical parameters in four plots with different successional vegetation, and a set of simulations was conducted to investigate the association of Fe and peat-derived dissolved organic carbon catalysed by laccase. Results Our results indicate Fe-bound OC content varies regularly with the succession gradients, and a significant positive relationship between laccase activities and Fe-bound OC content was found (R = 0.77, P < 0.05). Although laccase degradation of recalcitrant polyphenolics is related with the CO2 release from peat soils (R = 0.697; P < 0.05), the simulation results confirmed laccase can significantly promote the formation of Fe-OM association. Conclusions We propose that laccase plays a unique multifunctional role in the peatland carbon cycle. That is, while laccase degrades refractory organic matter such as lignin, it may enhance carbon sequestration by promoting the formation of Fe-OM association, which is particularly effective in acidic peat environments containing abundant iron and laccase-producing fungi.

AB Northern peatlands contribute to the global carbon cycle by way of gas emissions in the form of biogenic carbon dioxide and methane originating in the subsurface. Determining how much gas is present and where it is trapped is essential to understanding the role of northern peatlands on the global carbon cycle, particularly in regard to methane cycling. In this study, spatial variability in free phase gas content was estimated using ground penetrating radar (GPR) along a 1.4 km transect crossing distinct peat landforms including a bog crest, midslope lawn, and fen. Variations in gas content and distribution were observed in landforms crossed by this transect. Estimated gas content up to 25% by volume was observed in landforms dominated by woody surface vegetation. In areas of the midslope lawn, the estimated gas content was greater than 15%, while estimated gas contents between 0% and 7% were found in the fen. Changes in estimated gas content of up to 20% were observed over distances of 100 m across a transition between a stand of 10 m tall trees and an adjacent fen. The mean of the estimated errors in gas content is 1.3%, suggesting that these large changes in estimated gas content between landforms can be clearly determined using geophysical methods. A geophysical image of the distribution of free phase across this transect reveals evidence for gas storage in deep peat in intervals as thin as 0.35 m. These data support conceptual models based on accumulation and storage of free phase gas in deep peat.

AB Blanket bogs are a globally rare type of ombrotrophic peatland internationally recognized for long-term terrestrial carbon storage, the potential to serve as carbon sinks, habitat provision and for their palaeoenvironmental archive. This habitat is protected in the European Union under the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), but a number of blanket bogs located in the Cantabrian Mountains (northern Spain), representing the southernmost known edge-of-range for this habitat in Europe, are currently not recognized and are at increased threat of loss. Using climatic data, topography, aerial photography and peat depth surveys, this study has identified 10 new areas of blanket bog located between the administrative regions of Cantabria and Castilla y Leon. Peat depth data and topography were used to provide a detailed geomorphological description and hydromorphological classification (mesotope units) of these currently unrecognized areas of blanket bog. Maximum peat depth measured across the 10 sites ranged from 1.61 to 3.78 m, covering a total area of 18.6 ha of blanket bog (>40 cm peat depth). The volume of peat accumulated across the sites was determined to be more than 216 000 m(3)and is estimated to hold 19.89 +/- 3.51 kt C. Twenty-four individual hydrological mesotope units were described, indicating a diverse assemblage of blanket bogs in this region. The peatlands identified in this research extend the known limit of blanket bogs in Europe farther south than previously recorded and - combined with four other unprotected blanket bogs recently identified in the Cantabrian Mountains - these peatlands represent 10.5% of blanket bog currently recognized and protected in Spain. The range of anthropogenic pressures currently acting on peatlands in the Cantabrian Mountains indicates that without protection these important landforms and stored carbon may be lost. An urgent update of European peatland inventories is thus required to preserve these valuable carbon stores and potential carbon sinks. (c) 2020 The Authors.

AB Arctic wetlands store nearly half of the world's soil organic carbon and are crucial to the global carbon cycle. However, most Earth system models fail to account for wetlands given heterogeneity and uncertainty surrounding the response of different wetland types to climate change. We analyzed summer (June-August) carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, meteorological conditions, and ecological conditions at four Arctic wetlands. Micrometeorological flux tower data were used to assess CO2 exchange and meteorological conditions across 7 to 9years of data. Climate data were used to assess meteorological conditions across 30years of data. Satellite data described ecological conditions. Each site acted as a CO2 sink, but strength varied, ranging from -49 to -93gC/m(2) per summer. A trend analysis was used to investigate how CO2 balance and surrounding conditions may have changed. CO2 exchange significantly changed at one site, becoming a stronger sink. Changes in meteorological conditions were variable across sites with the exception of air temperature which, when considering significant trends, unanimously increased across sites. Ecological conditions suggested increased vegetation cover regardless of statistical significance at all sites. A conditional random forest algorithm was used to evaluate drivers of CO2 exchange. Cumulative precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of net ecosystem exchange and gross primary productivity, while ecosystem respiration was primarily driven by air temperature, suggesting that projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns will influence the carbon balance of Arctic wetlands. Variability across sites emphasizes the need for long-term observations across wetland types and climatic gradients.

AB Peatlands drained for forestry have a high potential for CO2 emissions due to peat decomposition. Accurate estimates of either these emissions or soil carbon balances (Delta C-soil) on large areas are needed for national greenhouse gas inventories and as input for earth system models. The measurement of forest floor respiration (R-floor) or heterotrophic soil respiration (R-het) by portable chambers offers an affordable tool for extensive studies. So far, the reliability of respiration chamber based calculations of Delta C-soil, has not been tested and the prerequisites for their use have not been discussed. However, the method is being used in greenhouse gas inventories.
   In this study, we compared the results of two chamber based methods against a reference estimate based on eddy covariance measurements. In the first method, Delta C-soil was calculated by subtracting R-het from the litter input into the soil. In the second method, R floor was subtracted from the entire allocation of carbon (C) into the soil. A four-year detailed dataset of C dynamics of a drained peatland forest in southern Finland served as the test material.
   The R-het method produced results close to those of the reference method, but the results were sensitive to the choice of root turnover rates used in the estimation of litter input. The R-floor method resulted in a clear underestimation of soil C sink: the accurate estimation of the large photosynthesis and respiration fluxes needed for the calculation turned out to be difficult.
   In our opinion, the R-het method could be used to identify hot spots of forest soil CO2 emissions and for balance estimation for large areas. Further development of models for estimating the photosynthesis and respiration fluxes is needed for the application of the R-floor method. As the estimation of Delta C-soil by subtracting C output from C input is inherently sensitive to bias in the estimation of the input and output, the accuracy of both methods needs further testing with extensive datasets.

AB An attempt has been made to estimate the carbon dioxide budget of Sweden.  Fluxes considered include fossil-fuel combustion and limestone processing as well as changes in the carbon stores in forests, peatlands, cultivated soils and sediments.  The estimations indicate that more than half of the carbon released as carbon dioxide during fossil-fuel combustion (c. 16 Mton C per year) is currently accumulating in terrestrial ecosystems, mainly in the form of forest biomass (c. 9 Mton C per year).  Cultivated organic soils release c. 1-2 Mton C per year to the atmosphere, while peat and the sediments of lakes and coastal waters accumulate c. 4 Mton C per year.

AB The Little River (LR) in southern Georgia, U.S., has experienced lengthening droughts since monitoring began in 1972. We evaluated the impacts of drought on riverine carbon cycling using a 9year data set of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) coupled with laboratory experiments in the LR, as well as long-term data sets in three additional rivers within the Suwannee River basin. Longer drought periods reduced downstream DOC export but also led to higher DOC concentrations in the following hydroperiod. Within a hydroperiod, DOC concentration was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with river discharge but also negatively correlated with total discharge during the previous hydroperiod. Among hydroperiods, DOC concentration was more strongly correlated with antecedent hydrological conditions than with current hydrological conditions across broad spatial scales: in three additional rivers within the Suwannee River basin (Alapaha, Withlacoochee, and Okapilco) and in headwater and downstream reaches of the LR. Microbial DOC consumption and CO2 production were elevated when DOC concentration was high. Despite dramatic hydrologic changes, DOC composition appeared stable, with optical analyses suggesting that LR DOC is primarily composed of three terrestrial humic-like fluorescence groups. If the current climatic trend of intensifying droughts, elevated temperatures and decreased discharge continue, our results suggest the net effect may be for a more localized riverine carbon cycle with reduced downstream transport of DOC, but higher local mineralization rates due to elevated DOC concentrations.

AB Purpose CH4 emissions from peatlands are space and time dependent. The variety of efflux routes contributes to these variabilities. CH4 bubbling remains difficult to investigate since it occurs on a timescale of seconds. The aims of this study were to use for the first time the recently built infrared high-resolution spectrometer, SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Tropospherique to (1) measure in situ CH4 fluxes in natural and artificial peatland plot and (2) observe online bubbling events with quantification of CH4 emission fluxes corresponding to this very sudden degassing event.
   Material and methods The closed dynamic chamber method was used and the gas concentration was measured every 1.5 s. Emission fluxes were calculated by the accumulation rate of CH4 against time. Measurements were undertaken during daytime in March 2009 and during day-and nighttime in May 2009, in Sphagnum and Betula plots and in a wet artificially bared peat area with Eriophorum vaginatum.
   Results and discussion The results show that the CH4 emissions estimated with the SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Tropospherique (SPIRIT) are consistent with those already published. The high emissions, both through diffusion and bubbling in the Eriophorum plot, were on the same order as the emissions estimated in natural shallow pools. During daytime, CH4 bubbling was higher in May (54.7% of the total emission) than in March (40.7%) probably because of increased CH4 production and accumulation in peat. In May, bubbling was higher at nighttime (65.5%) than in daytime (54.7%). This has an important implication for carbon budget assessment in peatlands.
   Conclusions The recently built infrared spectrometer, SPIRIT, was able to reliably measure CH4 fluxes and quantify CH4 flux during the degassing of bubbles. The emissions obtained are in agreement with previously published data using other measurement techniques. The results of this preliminary work highlight (1) the importance of shallow pools in peatland CH4 emissions and (2) the sensitivity of such fluxes to atmospheric pressure, a relation that has not been fully investigated or taken into account in assessing peatland carbon balance.

AB Stratigraphical analyses based on 1028 dated Holocene peat cores were used to estimate the rate of carbon accumulation in Finnish peatlands. Results were compared with data from other Boreal areas. The basal age of peat columns was found to be the best predictor of carbon accumulation and a significant correlation between depth and age of peat was evident. When normalized for the mean depth of peatlands in Finland (c. 1.5 m), the average long-term carbon accumulation was 26.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1). In individual cores the values ranged from 2.8 to 88.6 g (average 22.5 +/- 11.6 g) being much higher in bogs than in fens and almost double in southern mires as compared with those in the northern Boreal zone. The modelled rate of actual carbon accumulation is about 2/3 of that above. Boreal mires are actual sinks of carbon for thousands of years ahead in the present climate. The predicted greenhouse warming may shift the present Sphagnum mires northward and the net effect may be to restrain the radiative forcing. Poorly known 3D mass accumulation in mires and unpredictable functioning of northern mire ecosystems to climatic changes (for example via increased mire fires) complicate this interpretation.

AB Drained coastal peatlands are a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) through abundant CO2 release caused by aerobic peat degradation. Published rates of CO2, fixation and CH4, release for natural peatlands suggest that areas of peat formation are a (small) net source of GHG emission because the radiative effect of emitted CH4 exceeds the CO2 uptake by the vegetation. It is shown here that wetland restoration of reclaimed peat areas in the western Netherlands leads to a reduction of GHG emission because the expected increase in anaerobically generated CH4 release is much smaller than the decrease in aerobically produced CO2.

AB Under the context of climate change, studying CO2 emissions in alpine rivers is important because of the large carbon storage in these terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, riverine partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CO2 emission flux (FCO2) in the Yellow River source region (YRSR) under different landcover types, including glaciers, permafrost, peatlands, and grasslands, were systematically investigated in April, June, August, and October 2016. Relevant chemical and environmental parameters were analyzed to explore the primary controlling factors. The results showed that most of the rivers in the YRSR were net CO2 source, with the pCO(2) ranging from 181 to 2441 mu atm and the FCO2 ranging from -50 to 1574 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Both pCO(2) and FCO2 showed strong spatial and temporal variations. The highest average FCO2 was observed in August, while the lowest average was observed in June. Spatially, the lowest FCO2 were observed in the permafrost regions while the highest FCO2 were observed in peatland. By integrating seasonal changes of the water surface area, total CO2 efflux was estimated to be 0.30 Tg C year(-1). This indicates that the YRSR was a net carbon source for the atmosphere, which contradicts previous studies that conclude the YRSR as a carbon sink. More frequent measurements of CO2 fluxes, particularly through several diel cycles, are necessary to confirm this conclusion. Furthermore, our study suggested that the riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in permafrost (5.0 +/- 2.4 mg L-1) is possibly derived from old carbon released from permafrost melting, which is equivalent to that in peatland regions (5.1 +/- 3.7 mg L-1). The degradation of DOC may have played an important role in supporting riverine CO2, especially in permafrost and glacier-covered regions. The percent coverage of corresponding land cover types is a good indicator for estimating riverine pCO(2) in the YRSR. In view of the extensive distribution of alpine rivers in the world and their sensitivity to climate change, future studies on dynamics of stream water pCO(2) and CO2 outgassing are strongly needed to better understand the global carbon cycle.

AB Peatlands are a key component of the global carbon cycle. Chronologies of peatland initiation are typically based on compiled basal peat radiocarbon (C-14) dates and frequency histograms of binned calibrated age ranges. However, such compilations are problematic because poor quality C-14 dates are commonly included and because frequency histograms of binned age ranges introduce chronological artefacts that bias the record of peatland initiation. Using a published compilation of 274 basal C-14 dates from Alaska as a case study, we show that nearly half the C-14 dates are inappropriate for reconstructing peatland initiation, and that the temporal structure of peatland initiation is sensitive to sampling biases and treatment of calibrated C-14 dates. We present revised chronologies of peatland initiation for Alaska and the circumpolar Arctic based on summed probability distributions of calibrated C-14 dates. These revised chronologies reveal that northern peatland initiation lagged abrupt increases in atmospheric CH4 concentration at the start of the Bolling-Allerod interstadial (Termination 1A) and the end of the Younger Dryas chronozone (Termination 1B), suggesting that northern peatlands were not the primary drivers of the rapid increases in atmospheric CH4. Our results demonstrate that subtle methodological changes in the synthesis of basal C-14 ages lead to substantially different interpretations of temporal trends in peatland initiation, with direct implications for the role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle.

TI The transient shift of driving environmental factors of carbon dioxide

AB Peatlands on the Tibetan Plateau play crucial roles in regional carbon cycling but faced serious degradation in recent decades, and hydrological restoration is being conducted to regain their ecosystem function. However, how restoration affects the environmental controls on carbon processes of these unique ecosystems remains unclear, and the role of vegetation community in regulating carbon processes in response to the restoration is unknown. A long dam was built at the outlet of a large shallow lake on the plateau in order to evaluate the effects of hydrological restoration on the carbon sequestration of the world's largest alpine peatlands. The carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from three widely distributed peatland communities, i.e., Kobresia pusilla, Carex enervis, and Carex rnuliensis commuities, were investigated immediately before and after restoration. The water table rising as a consequence of restoration, at least temporarily, decreased the carbon consumption rate (plant respiration plus soil decomposition) for each unit of carbon fixation by plants, which is community dependent. However, a positive relationship between temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and optimal water table for respiration implies a positive feedback between water table rising and warming on R-eco. Meanwhile, the dominant factor explaining the variance of R-eco shifted from soil temperature (explained 56%) to water table (explained 68%) after restoration. Water table rising enhanced the CH4 emissions by 3-12 times, with significantly different changes in CH4 flux over a standard variation in water table level among the communities. Temperature was excluded while only water table and vegetation type were included in the model to predict CH4 fluxes after restoration in contrast to before. We argue that the shift of driving environmental factors and the role of vegetation community are essential in evaluating the effects of hydrological restoration on carbon cycling of Plateau peatlands, particularly during the transitional period.

AB Thawing permafrost and the resulting microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon (C) is one of the most significant potential feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a changing climate. In this article we present an overview of the global permafrost C pool and of the processes that might transfer this C into the atmosphere, as well as the associated ecosystem changes that occur with thawing. We show that accounting for C stored deep in the permafrost more than doubles previous high-latitude inventory estimates, with this new estimate equivalent to twice the atmospheric C pool. The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastrophically exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be altered by climate change along with thawing permafrost, such as growing season length, plant growth rates and species composition, and ecosystem energy exchange. However, these processes do not appear to be able to compensate for C release from thawing permafrost, making it likely that the net effect of widespread permafrost thawing will be a positive feedback to a warming climate.

AB Wetlands exist in a transition zone between aquatic and terrestrial environments which can be altered by subtle changes in hydrology. Twentieth century climate records show that the United States is generally experiencing a trend towards a wetter, warmer climate; some climate models suggest that this trend will continue and possibly intensify over the next 100 years. Wetlands that are most likely to be affected by these and other potential changes (e.g., sea-level rise) associated with atmospheric carbon enrichment include permafrost wetlands, coastal and estuarine wetlands, peatlands, alpine wetlands, and prairie pothole wetlands. Potential impacts range from changes in community structure to changes in ecological function, and from extirpation to enhancement. Wetlands (particularly boreal peatlands) play an important role in the global carbon cycle, generally sequestering carbon in the form of biomass, methane, dissolved organic material and organic sediment. Wetlands that are drained or partially dried can become a net source of methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, serving as a positive biotic feedback to global warming. Policy options for minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change on wetland ecosystems include the reduction of current anthropogenic stresses, allowing for inland migration of coastal wetlands as sea-level rises, active management to preserve wetland hydrology, and a wide range of other management and restoration options.

AB Although the majority of coastal sediments consist of sandy material, in some areas marine ingression caused the submergence of terrestrial carbon-rich peat soils. This affects the coastal carbon balance, as peat represents a potential carbon source. We performed a column experiment to better understand the coupled flow and biogeochemical processes governing carbon transformations in submerged peat under coastal fresh groundwater (GW) discharge and brackish water intrusion. The columns contained naturally layered sediments with and without peat (organic carbon content in peat 39 +/- 14 wt%), alternately supplied with oxygen-rich brackish water from above and oxygen-poor, low-saline GW from below. The low-saline GW discharge through the peat significantly increased the release and ascent of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the peat (delta C-13(DOC) - 26.9 parts per thousand to - 27.7 parts per thousand), which was accompanied by the production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), implying DOC mineralization. Oxygen respiration, sulfate (SO42-) reduction, and methane (CH4) formation were differently pronounced in the sediments and were accompanied with higher microbial abundances in peat compared to sand with SO42--reducing bacteria clearly dominating methanogens. With decreasing salinity and SO42- concentrations, CH4 emission rates increased from 16.5 to 77.3 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) during a 14-day, low-saline GW discharge phase. In contrast, oxygenated brackish water intrusion resulted in lower DOC and DIC pore water concentrations and significantly lower CH4 and CO2 emissions. Our study illustrates the strong dependence of carbon cycling in shallow coastal areas with submerged peat deposits on the flow and mixing dynamics within the subterranean estuary.

AB Peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum constitute the bulk of living and dead biomass in bogs. These plants contain peculiar polyphenols which hamper litter peat decomposition through their inhibitory activity on microbial breakdown. In the light of the increasing availability of biologically active nitrogen in natural ecosystems, litter derived from Sphagnum mosses is an ideal substrate to test the potential effects of increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition on polyphenol content in litter peat. To this aim, we measured total nitrogen and soluble polyphenol concentration in Sphagnum litter peat collected in I I European bogs under a chronic gradient of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Our results demonstrate that increasing nitrogen concentration in Sphagnum litter, as a consequence of increased exogenous nitrogen availability, is accompanied by a decreasing concentration of polyphenols. This inverse relationship is consistent with reports that in Sphagnum mosses, polyphenol and protein biosynthesis compete for the same precursor. Our observation of modified Sphagnum litter chemistry under chronic nitrogen eutrophication has implications in the context of the global carbon balance, because a lower content of decay-inhibiting polyphenols would accelerate litter peat decomposition.

TI Increasing contribution of peatlands to boreal evapotranspiration in a

AB Climate warming increases evapotranspiration (ET) more in boreal peatlands than in forests. Observations show that peatland ET can exceed forest ET by up to 30%, indicating a stronger warming response in peatlands. Earth system models do not fully account for peatlands and hence may underestimate future boreal ET.
   The response of evapotranspiration (ET) to warming is of critical importance to the water and carbon cycle of the boreal biome, a mosaic of land cover types dominated by forests and peatlands. The effect of warming-induced vapour pressure deficit (VPD) increases on boreal ET remains poorly understood because peatlands are not specifically represented as plant functional types in Earth system models. Here we show that peatland ET increases more than forest ET with increasing VPD using observations from 95 eddy covariance tower sites. At high VPD of more than 2 kPa, peatland ET exceeds forest ET by up to 30%. Future (2091-2100) mid-growing season peatland ET is estimated to exceed forest ET by over 20% in about one-third of the boreal biome for RCP4.5 and about two-thirds for RCP8.5. Peatland-specific ET responses to VPD should therefore be included in Earth system models to avoid biases in water and carbon cycle projections.

AB We tested here a plant-soil system to separate recent, plant-derived and native, soil-derived carbon in soil respiration. The approach uses a perennial crop cultivated on an organic soil where upper soil layers have been removed as a result of peat extraction. There, the C-14 signal from native organic matter is highly depleted compared to that in vegetation established at the site after peat extraction ceased. Radiocarbon was analyzed in carbon dioxide respired from soil over one growing season, and a two-pool isotope mixing model was applied to calculate the relative contribution of old vs. new carbon sources. The analysis showed that the approach is reliable for source partitioning with isotopes. After six years of cultivation, old peat decomposition contributed less to total soil respiration than respiration of recent plant material (30% vs. 70% on average, respectively), but the relative proportions were highly variable over the growing season. The approach offers a new possibility to follow the fate of old, native soil organic matter in highly organic soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate the microbial utilization of organic carbon in peatland ecosystem, water samples were collected from the Dajiuhu Peatland and nearby lakes, central China across the year of 2014. The acridine orange (AO) staining and Biolog Eco microplates were used to numerate microbial counts and determine the carbon utilization of microbial communities. Meanwhile, physicochemical characteristics were measured for subsequent analysis of the correlation between microbial carbon utilization and environmental factors. Results indicated that total microbial counts were between 10(6)-10(7) cells/L. Microbial diversities and carbon utilization rates showed a similar pattern, highest in September and lowest in November. Microbial communities in the peat pore waters preferred to utilize N-bearing carbon sources such as amines and amino acids compared with microbial communities in lakes. The network analysis of microbial utilization of 31 carbon substrates clearly distinguished microbial communities from peat pore waters and those from lakes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed the total organic nitrogen content (P=0.03, F=2.5) and daily average temperature (P=0.034, F=2.4) significantly controlled microbial carbon utilization throughout the sampling period. Our report is the first one to address the temporal and spatial variations of carbon utilization of microbial communities which are closely related to the decomposition of organic matter in the Dajiuhu Peatland in context of climate warming.

TI Sulfate-reducing microorganisms in wetlands - fameless actors in carbon
   cycling and climate change

   cycle; peatland; rice paddy; sulfate-reducing microorganisms; sulfur

AB Freshwater wetlands are a major source of the greenhouse gas methane but at the same time can function as carbon sink. Their response to global warming and environmental pollution is one of the largest unknowns in the upcoming decades to centuries. In this review, we highlight the role of sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM) in the intertwined element cycles of wetlands. Although regarded primarily as methanogenic environments, biogeochemical studies have revealed a previously hidden sulfur cycle in wetlands that can sustain rapid renewal of the small standing pools of sulfate. Thus, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, which frequently occurs at rates comparable to marine surface sediments, can contribute up to 36-50% to anaerobic carbon mineralization in these ecosystems. Since sulfate reduction is thermodynamically favored relative to fermentative processes and methanogenesis, it effectively decreases gross methane production thereby mitigating the flux of methane to the atmosphere. However, very little is known about wetland SRM. Molecular analyses using dsrAB [encoding subunit A and B of the dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase] as marker genes demonstrated that members of novel phylogenetic lineages, which are unrelated to recognized SRM, dominate dsrAB richness and, if tested, are also abundant among the dsrAB-containing wetland microbiota. These discoveries point toward the existence of so far unknown SRM that are an important part of the autochthonous wetland microbiota. In addition to these numerically dominant microorganisms, a recent stable isotope probing study of SRM in a German peatland indicated that rare biosphere members might be highly active in situ and have a considerable stake in wetland sulfate reduction. The hidden sulfur cycle in wetlands and the fact that wetland SRM are not well represented by described SRM species explains their so far neglected role as important actors in carbon cycling and climate change.

AB Soil enzyme activities play a pivotal role in ecosystem processes, such as organic carbon decomposition or nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization. Thus, enzyme activities measurements can provide insights into the rates of ecosystem-level processes in peatlands. Hummock-hollow microtopography is a common feature in boreal peatlands, but its influence on soil enzyme activity is not well understood. We investigated the effects of hummock-hollow microtopography on activities of three soil hydrolases (beta-1,4-glucosidase (beta G), 4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), and acid phosphatase (AP)) and one oxidase (peroxidase (PER)), as well as environmental variables in a sedge-dominated peatland in Changbai Mountains, in northeast China. We found that soil enzyme activities had large microtopographical and seasonal heterogeneity. During the growing season, the activities of three soil hydrolases (beta G, NAG and AP) in hummocks were 6.6, 4.6 and 5.5 times higher than those in hollows, while the PER activity in hollows was 1.9 times higher than in hummocks. Soil enzyme activities in hummocks exhibited obvious seasonal variation, with the pG, beta P and PER presenting minimum values in summer and peak values in spring and autumn. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that soil enzyme activity had larger microtopographical heterogeneity than seasonal variations. Water table position explained most variation (74.1%) in soil enzyme activity, followed by soil temperature (5.5%) and pH (3.1%) based on ordination analysis using RDA. We conclude that hummock-hollow microtopography creates heterogeneity in hydrologic conditions, soil temperature and nutrients, and thus influences soil enzyme activity involved in carbon and nutrient cycling in sedge-dominated peatlands. This information stresses the importance of hummock-hollow microtopography in regulating carbon and nutrient cycling in northern peatlands.

AB Northern peatlands contain up to 25% of the world's soil carbon (C) and have an estimated annual exchange of CO2-C with the atmosphere of 0.1-0.5 Pg yr(-1) and of CH4-C of 10-25 Tg yr(-1). Despite this overall importance to the global C cycle, there have been few, if any, complete multiyear annual C balances for these ecosystems. We report a 6-year balance computed from continuous net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), regular instantaneous measurements of methane (CH4) emissions, and export of dissolved organic C (DOC) from a northern ombrotrophic bog. From these observations, we have constructed complete seasonal and annual C balances, examined their seasonal and interannual variability, and compared the mean 6-year contemporary C exchange with the apparent C accumulation for the last 3000 years obtained from C density and age-depth profiles from two peat cores. The 6-year mean NEE-C and CH4-C exchange, and net DOC loss are -40.2 +/- 40.5 (+/- 1 SD), 3.7 +/- 0.5, and 14.9 +/- 3.1 g m(-2) yr(-1), giving a 6-year mean balance of -21.5 +/- 39.0 g m(-2) yr(-1) (where positive exchange is a loss of C from the ecosystem). NEE had the largest magnitude and variability of the components of the C balance, but DOC and CH4 had similar proportional variabilities and their inclusion is essential to resolve the C balance. There are large interseasonal and interannual ranges to the exchanges due to variations in climatic conditions. We estimate from the largest and smallest seasonal exchanges, quasi-maximum limits of the annual C balance between 50 and -105 g m(-2) yr(-1). The net C accumulation rate obtained from the two peatland cores for the interval 400-3000 bp (samples from the anoxic layer only) were 21.9 +/- 2.8 and 14.0 +/- 37.6 g m(-2) yr(-1), which are not significantly different from the 6-year mean contemporary exchange.

AB Rewetting of drained industrial peatlands may reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promote recolonisation by peat forming plant species. We investigated carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics over a three-year period in a rewetted industrial peatland in Ireland. Sample plots were established in bare peat, Juncus effusus-Sphagnum cuspidatum, Sphagnum cuspidatum and Eriophorum angustifolium dominated microsites. The relationships between fluxes and environmental variables were examined and regression models were used to provide an estimate of the annual GHG balance for each microsite. All the vegetated microsites were carbon sinks for the duration of the study. Highest uptake occurred in the Eriophorum microsite (146-583 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by Juncus-Sphagnum (35-204 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and Sphagnum (5-140 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The bare peat microsite was a source of 37-82 g C m(-2) yr(-1). No N2O fluxes were detected. Strong inter-annual variation was observed in all microsites, driven by variation in precipitation and subsequent changes in the position of the water table. In terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP), the microsites had either a cooling effect (Eriophorum), a close to neutral effect (Juncus-Sphagnum, Sphagnum) or a warming effect (bare peat) on the climate.

AB Bacteria in peat forest soil play important role in global carbon cycling. The distribution of bacteria population in different peat soils as a whole and how forest management practices alter the bacterial populations are still poorly known. Using pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA gene, we quantified the diversity and community structure of bacteria in eight peat forest soils (pristine and drained) and two mineral forest soils from Lakkasuo, Finland with either spruce-dominant or pine-dominant tree species. In total, 191,229 sequences which ranged from 15,710 to 22,730 per sample were obtained and affiliated to 13 phyla, 30 classes and 155 genera, The peat forest soils showed high bacterial diversity and species richness. The tree species seems to have more strong impact on the bacterial diversity than the type of peat soil, which drives the changes in bacterial community structure. The dominant taxonomic groups across all soils (>1% of all sequences) were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia. The relative abundance of bacteria phylum and genus differed between soil types and between vegetation. Significant differences in relative abundance of bacteria phyla were only found for Gemmatimonadetes and Cyanobacteria between the pristine and the drained peat forest soils. At genus level, the relative abundance of several genera differed significantly between the peat soils with same or different tree species, including Burkholderia, Caulobacter, Opitutus, Mucilanginibacter, Acidocella, Mycobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, Dyella and Rhodanobacter.

AB Drained peatlands are a global concern due to alterations of the water and carbon cycle, loss of habitat, and increased fire frequency. However, methods for restoring drained sloping peatlands are limited and poorly tested. Therefore, we measured water table dynamics, CO2 fluxes, and soil properties at four sloping fens that were restored (1-20years post-restoration) with the installation of small check dams in ditches that had drained the sites for a century. Restoration had a positive effect on water tables, increasing from approximately 45cm below the surface to approximately 15cm below the surface during the summers. Restoration also benefited CO2 fluxes, as the mean net ecosystem exchange was greatest in the restored areas (-2.19gCO(2)m(-2)hour(-1)) compared to the unrestored drained areas (-1.28gCO(2)m(-2)hour(-1)), while in reference areas it was -1.74gCO(2)m(-2)hour(-1). Drainage also caused significant changes to the peat soil including: 25% reduction in soil organic matter (lost between 1.4 to 3.6kg/m(2)), increased bulk density, decreased porosity, and reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity. Restoration did not affect these parameters, even 20years after restoration. This study suggests that although natural water table levels have been reestablished and the process of carbon sequestration improved, the physical properties of the most disturbed, near surface peat soils do not mimic reference conditions 20years post-restoration.

AB There is growing recognition that changes in vegetation composition can strongly influence peatland carbon cycling, with potential feedbacks to future climate. Nevertheless, despite accelerated climate and vegetation change in this ecosystem, the growth responses of peatland plant species to combined warming and vegetation change are unknown. Here, we used a field warming and vegetation removal experiment to test the hypothesis that dominant species from the three plant functional types present (dwarf-shrubs: Calluna vulgaris; graminoids: Eriophorum vaginatum; bryophytes: Sphagnum capillifolium) contrast in their growth responses to warming and the presence or absence of other plant functional types. Warming was accomplished using open top chambers, which raised air temperature by approximately 0.35 degrees C, and we measured air and soil microclimate as potential mechanisms through which both experimental factors could influence growth. We found that only Calluna growth increased with experimental warming (by 20 %), whereas the presence of dwarf-shrubs and bryophytes increased growth of Sphagnum (46 %) and Eriophorum (20 %), respectively. Sphagnum growth was also negatively related to soil temperature, which was lower when dwarf-shrubs were present. Dwarf-shrubs may therefore promote Sphagnum growth by cooling the peat surface. Conversely, the effect of bryophyte presence on Eriophorum growth was not related to any change in microclimate, suggesting other factors play a role. In conclusion, our findings reveal contrasting abiotic and biotic controls over dominant peatland plant growth, suggesting that community composition and carbon cycling could be modified by simultaneous climate and vegetation change.

AB Drainage of peatlands increases the depth of the oxic peat layer and can turn them into a carbon (C) source to the atmosphere. Afforestation of drained peatlands could help to reverse this process since the trees may enhance C sequestration. We followed the C and water dynamics of an afforested drained peatland in S-Iceland during a 2 year period, during which the Black Cottonwood (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa) plantation was 23-25 year old. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with the eddy covariance method and C pools of trees and ground vegetation were measured using the stock change method. Lateral losses of dissolved and particulated organic C (DOC, POC) were estimated from weekly water-runoff samples. Unexpectedly, the afforested drained peatland was a strong sink of carbon during the two years, with an average NEE value of 714 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Only 0.5% of the total NEE was lost through lateral DOC and POC transport, leaving 710 g C m(-2) yr(-1) as the total net ecosystem production (NEP). Ca. 91% of the observed NEP could be explained by the annual biomass increment of the Black Cottonwood trees and 1.3% by the ground vegetation. This means that the remaining 7.5% of the total NEP most likely accumulated in peat soil and litter, contributing to the soil C stocks. The dormant-season CO2 emissions were unexpectedly low, which was explained by a high groundwater level at this drained site outside the ca. 5 months of the active growing season. On average, 66% of the annual measured precipitation was estimated to have evaporated back to the atmosphere. This left 416 mm for potential runoff, which was somewhat lower value than the measured runoff (662 mm). These results indicate that during the age span of ca. 20-25 years, afforestation was a valid method to reverse the expected negative C-balance of this drained grassland pasture in Iceland. Although the site is currently a soil C sink, simulation studies with process models are needed to test whether such sites could remain C sinks when managed for forestry over several tree-stand rotations.

AB A large amount of organic carbon is stored in high-latitude soils. A substantial proportion of this carbon stock is vulnerable and may decompose rapidly due to temperature increases that are already greater than the global average. It is therefore crucial to quantify and understand carbon exchange between the atmosphere and subarctic/arctic ecosystems. In this paper, we combine an Arctic-enabled version of the process-based dynamic ecosystem model, LPJ-GUESS (version LPJG-WHyMe-TFM) with comprehensive observations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes to simulate long-term carbon exchange in a subarctic catchment at 50m resolution. Integrating the observed carbon fluxes from aquatic systems with the modeled terrestrial carbon fluxes across the whole catchment, we estimate that the area is a carbon sink at present and will become an even stronger carbon sink by 2080, which is mainly a result of a projected densification of birch forest and its encroachment into tundra heath. However, the magnitudes of the modeled sinks are very dependent on future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, comparisons of global warming potentials between two simulations with and without CO2 increase since 1960 reveal that the increased methane emission from the peatland could double the warming effects of the whole catchment by 2080 in the absence of CO2 fertilization of the vegetation. This is the first process-based model study of the temporal evolution of a catchment-level carbon budget at high spatial resolution, including both terrestrial and aquatic carbon. Though this study also highlights some limitations in modeling subarctic ecosystem responses to climate change, such as aquatic system flux dynamics, nutrient limitation, herbivory and other disturbances, and peatland expansion, our study provides one process-based approach to resolve the complexity of carbon cycling in subarctic ecosystems while simultaneously pointing out the key model developments for capturing complex subarctic processes.

AB Northern peatlands store similar to 30% of the global soil carbon, despite covering only 3% of the land. To understand the carbon balance of these systems and predict their response to changes in climate, robust and reliable models are needed. The McGill Wetland Model (MWM), originally developed to simulate the carbon dynamics of ombrotrophic bogs, was modified to simulate the CO2 biogeochemistry of sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatlands, a prominent peatland type in boreal and subarctic landscapes. Three modifications were implemented: (1) a function to describe the impact of soil moisture on the optimal gross primary production, (2) a scheme to partition the peat profile into oxic and anoxic compartments based on the effective root depth as a function of daily sedge net primary production, and (3) a function to describe the fen moss water dynamics. The modified MWM was evaluated using eddy-covariance net ecosystem production (NEP) from Degero Stormyr in northern Sweden. The root mean square error for daily NEP was similar to 0.46g C m(-2) d(-1), and the index of agreement was 84%. This model adequately captures the magnitude and direction of the CO2 fluxes and simulates the seasonal and inter-annual variability reasonably well (r(2)>0.8). Sensitivity analysis confirms that specifically water table depth (WTD) and moss water content are key biogeochemical hydrology processes for the carbon biogeochemistry of a sedge-dominated oligotrophic minerogenic peatland. An increase of WTD by 15cm or air temperature by 3 degrees C could decrease NEP by up to 200% and make the peatland become a source of CO2.

AB Peatlands are unique ecological communities that represent long-term terrestrial carbon sinks with enormous organic substance supply. Soil organic substance represents the main source of organic carbon in the biosphere, and depending of conditions, it is able to eliminate or sequestrate greenhouse gasses in the environment. Current methods of peatbogs assessment rely on the use of ecological indicators, but often lack an in-depth analysis of soil parameters. The objective of this study was to examine vertical profiles of selected soil properties (soil reaction, soil organic carbon content, soil moisture) and various types of microbial activity (soil basal respiration, microbial biomass carbon, activity of soil urease, phosphatases and catalase). Soil samples were collected from three sites (centre of peatbog, edge of peatbog and site closely surrounding peatbog) on the peat soil at three depth intervals (0-0.10 m, 0.10-0.20 m and 0.20-0.30 m) in northeast of Slovakia. Enzyme and microbial activities decreased with depth, but significant correlation was found with alkaline phosphatase. Average values of most soil biochemical indices were highest at the centre of peatbog with the exception of urease and catalase activity. Our results indicated that enzymatic and biological potential for organic matter mineralization was strongly correlated to soil pH, soil moisture and soil organic matter content.

AB Peatlands after drainage and extraction are large sources of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. Restoration, through re-wetting and revegetation, aims to return the C sink function by re-establishing conditions similar to that of an undrained peatland. However, the time needed to re-establish C sequestration is not well constrained due to the lack of multi-year measurements. We measured over 3 years the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), methane (FCH4), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at a restored post-extraction peatland (RES) in southeast Canada (restored 14 years prior to the start of the study) and compared our observations to the C balance of an intact reference peatland (REF) that has a long-term continuous flux record and is in the same climate zone. Small but significant differences in winter respiration driven by temperature were mainly responsible for differences in cumulative NEE between years. Low growing season inter-annual variability was linked to constancy of the initial spring water table position, controlled by the blocked drainage ditches and the presence of water storage structures (bunds and pools). Half-hour FCH4 at RES was small except when Typha latifolia-invaded drainage ditches were in the tower footprint; this effect at the ecosystem level was small as ditches represent a minor fraction of RES. The restored peatland was an annual sink for CO2 (-90 +/- 18 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a source of CH4 (4.4 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and a source of DOC (6.9 +/- 2.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)), resulting in mean net ecosystem uptake of 78 +/- 17 g C m(-2) year(-1). Annual NEE at RES was most similar to wetter, more productive years at REF. Integrating structures to increase water retention, alongside re-establishing key species, have been effective at re-establishing the net C sink rate to that of an intact peatland.

AB As the lifetime of regional flux networks approach twenty years, there is a growing number of papers that have published long term records (5 years or more) of net carbon fluxes between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Unanswered questions from this body of work are: 1) how variable are carbon fluxes on a year to year basis?; 2) what are the biophysical factors that may cause interannual variability and/or temporal trends in carbon fluxes?; and 3) how does the biophysical control on this carbon flux variability differ by climate and ecological spaces? To address these questions, we surveyed published data from 59 sites that reported on five or more years of continuous measurements, yielding 544 site-years of data.
   We found that the standard deviation of the interannual variability in net ecosystem carbon exchange (162 gC m(-2) y(-1)) is large relative to its population mean (-200 gC m(-2) y(-1)). Broad-leaved evergreen forests and crops experienced the greatest absolute variability in interannual net carbon exchange (greater than 300 gC m(-2) y(-1)) and boreal evergreen forests and maritime wetlands were among the least variable (less than 40 gC m(-2) y(-1)).
   A disproportionate fraction of the yearly variability in net ecosystem exchange was associated with biophysical factors that modulated ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. Yet, there was appreciable and statistically significant covariance between ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Consequently, biophysical conditions that conspired to increase ecosystem photosynthesis to from one year to the next were associated with an increase in ecosystem respiration, and vice versa; on average, the year to year change in respiration was 40% as large as the year to year change in photosynthesis. The analysis also identified sets of ecosystems that are on the verge of switching from being carbon sinks to carbon sources. These include sites in the Arctic tundra, the evergreen forests in the Pacific northwest and some grasslands, where year to year changes in respiration are outpacing those in photosynthesis.
   While a select set of climatic and ecological factors (e.g. light, rainfall, temperature, phenology) played direct and indirect roles on this variability, their impact differed conditionally, as well as by climate and ecological spaces. For example, rainfall had both positive and negative effects. Deficient rainfall caused a physiological decline in photosynthesis in temperate and semi-arid regions. Too much rain, in the humid tropics, limited photosynthesis by limiting light. In peatlands and tundra, excess precipitation limited ecosystem respiration when it raised the water table to the surface. For deciduous forests, warmer temperatures lengthened the growing season, increasing photosynthesis, but this effect also increased soil respiration.
   Finally, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the detection limit of trends; we computed the confidence intervals of trends in multi-year carbon fluxes that need to be resolved to conclude whether the differences are to be attributed to randomness or biophysical forcings. Future studies and reports on interannual variations need to consider the role of the duration of the time series on random errors when quantifying potential trends and extreme events.

AB While peatland ecosystems overall are long-term net carbon (C) sinks, the open water pools that are characteristic of boreal peatlands have been found to be C sources to the atmosphere. However, the contribution of these pools to the ecosystem level C budget is often ignored even if they cover a significant area of the peatland surface. Here we examine the annual CO2 and CH4 ecosystem-atmosphere exchange, including the release following ice melt, from pools in a boreal maritime peatland, in order to estimate the annual loss of C from these water bodies. Over a 16month period, dissolved CO2 and CH4 were measured periodically in five pools while continuous measurements of CO2 were made in one pool using a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor. Fluxes were calculated using the thin boundary layer model and the eddy covariance technique (spring release only). We calculated an annual C release from pools of 103.3g C m(-2)yr(-1) of which 15% was released during the spring ice melt. This release is the same order of magnitude, but with the opposite sign, as the average net ecosystem carbon balance for pool-free northern peatlands (-22 to -70g C m(-2)yr(-1)). We discuss the origin of the released C, as the magnitude of the release could have a significant impact on the contemporary C exchange of boreal peatlands.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in surface waters have increased across much of Europe and North America, with implications for the terrestrial carbon balance, aquatic ecosystem functioning, water treatment costs and human health. Over the past decade, many hypotheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon, from changing climate and land management to eutrophication and acid deposition. Resolution of this debate has been hindered by a reliance on correlative analyses of time series data, and a lack of robust experimental testing of proposed mechanisms. In a 4 year, four-site replicated field experiment involving both acidifying and deacidifying treatments, we tested the hypothesis that DOC leaching was previously suppressed by high levels of soil acidity in peat and organo-mineral soils, and therefore that observed DOC increases a consequence of decreasing soil acidity. We observed a consistent, positive relationship between DOC and acidity change at all sites. Responses were described by similar hyperbolic relationships between standardized changes in DOC and hydrogen ion concentrations at all sites, suggesting potentially general applicability. These relationships explained a substantial proportion of observed changes in peak DOC concentrations in nearby monitoring streams, and application to a UK-wide upland soil pH dataset suggests that recovery from acidification alone could have led to soil solution DOC increases in the range 46126% by habitat type since 1978. Our findings raise the possibility that changing soil acidity may have wider impacts on ecosystem carbon balances. Decreasing sulphur deposition may be accelerating terrestrial carbon loss, and returning surface waters to a natural, high-DOC condition.

AB One major challenge to the improvement of regional climate scenarios for the northern high latitudes is to understand land surface feedbacks associated with vegetation shifts and ecosystem biogeochemical cycling. We employed a customized, Arctic version of the individual-based dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to simulate the dynamics of upland and wetland ecosystems under a regional climate model-downscaled future climate projection for the Arctic and Subarctic. The simulated vegetation distribution (1961-1990) agreed well with a composite map of actual arctic vegetation. In the future (2051-2080), a poleward advance of the forest-tundra boundary, an expansion of tall shrub tundra, and a dominance shift from deciduous to evergreen boreal conifer forest over northern Eurasia were simulated. Ecosystems continued to sink carbon for the next few decades, although the size of these sinks diminished by the late 21st century. Hot spots of increased CH4 emission were identified in the peatlands near Hudson Bay and western Siberia. In terms of their net impact on regional climate forcing, positive feedbacks associated with the negative effects of tree-line, shrub cover and forest phenology changes on snow-season albedo, as well as the larger sources of CH4, may potentially dominate over negative feedbacks due to increased carbon sequestration and increased latent heat flux.

AB Peatland rewetting aims at stopping the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and establishing net carbon sinks. However, in times of global warming, restoration projects must increasingly deal with extreme events such as drought periods. Here, we evaluate the effect of the European summer drought 2018 on vegetation development and the exchange of methane (CH4) and CO(2)in two rewetted minerotrophic fens (Hutelmoor-Hte and Zarnekow-Zrk) including potential carry-over effects in the post-drought year. Drought was a major stress factor for the established vegetation but also promoted the rapid spread of new vegetation, which will likely gain a lasting foothold in Zrk. Accordingly, drought increased not only respiratory CO(2)losses but also photosynthetic CO(2)uptake. Altogether, the drought reduced the net CO(2)sink in Hte, while it stopped the persistent net CO(2)emissions of Zrk. In addition, the drought reduced CH(4)emissions in both fens, though this became most apparent in the post-drought year and suggests a lasting shift towards non-methanogenic organic matter decomposition. Occasional droughts can be beneficial for the restoration of the peatland carbon sink function if the newly grown vegetation increases CO(2)sequestration in the long term. Nonetheless, care must be taken to prevent extensive peat decay. This article is part of the theme issue 'Impacts of the 2018 severe drought and heatwave in Europe: from site to continental scale'.

AB In order to enhance the nitrogen removal, a subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS) was improved by adding peat in deep soil as carbon source for denitrification process. The effects of addition of carbon source in the underpart of the SWIS on nitrogen removal at different influents (with the total nitrogen (TN) concentration 40 and 80 mg L-1 respectively) were investigated by soil column simulating experiments. When the relatively light pollution influent with 40 mg TN was used, the average concentrations of NO3--N and TN in effluents were (4.69 +/- 0.235), (6.18 +/- 0.079) mg L-1, respectively, decreased by 32 and 30.8% than the control; the NO3--N concentration of all effluents was below the maximum contaminant level of 10 mg L-1; as high as 92.67% of the TN removal efficiency was achieved. When relatively heavy pollution influent with 80 mg L-1 TN was used, the average concentrations of NO3--N and TN in effluents were (10.2 +/- 0.265), (12.5 +/- 0.148) mg L-1 respectively, decreased by 20 and 21.2% than the control; the NO3--N concentration of all effluents met the grade III of the national quality standard for ground water of China (GB/T 14848-1993) with the values less than 20 mg the TN removal efficiency of 94.1% was achieved. In summary, adding peat in the underpart of the SWIS significantly decreased TN and NO3--N concentration in effluents and the nitrogen removal efficiency improved significantly.

AB The response of peatlands to changes in the climatic water budget is crucial to predicting potential feedbacks on the global carbon (C) cycle. To gain insight on the patterns and mechanisms of response, we linked a model of peat accumulation to a model of peatland hydrology, then applied these models to empirical data spanning the past 5000 years for the large mire Store Mosse in southern Sweden. We estimated parameters for C sequestration and height growth by fitting the peat accumulation model to two age profiles. Then, we used independent reconstruction of climate wetness and model reconstruction of bog height to examine changes in peatland hydrology. Reconstructions of C sequestration showed two distinct patterns of behaviour: abrupt increases associated with major transitions in vegetation and dominant Sphagnum species (fuscum, rubellum-fuscum and magellanicum stages), and gradual decreases associated with increasing humification of newly formed peat. Carbon sequestration rate ranged from a minimum of 14 to a maximum of 72 g m(-2) yr(-1), with the most rapid changes occurring in the past 1000 years. Vegetation transitions were associated with periods of increasing climate wetness during which the hydrological requirement for increased seepage loss was met by rise of the water table closer to the peatland surface, with the indirect result of enhancing peat formation. Gradual decline in C sequestration within each vegetation stage resulted from enhanced litter decay losses from the near-surface layer. In the first two vegetation stages, peatland development (i.e., increasing surface gradient) and decreasing climate wetness drove a gradual increase in thickness of the unsaturated, near-surface layer, reducing seepage water loss and peat formation. In the most recent vegetation stage, the surface diverged into a mosaic of wet and dry microsites. Despite a steady increase in climate wetness, C sequestration declined rapidly. The complexity of response to climate change cautions against use of past rates to estimate current or to predict future rates of peatland C sequestration. Understanding interactions among hydrology, surface structure and peat formation are essential to predicting potential feedback on the global C cycle.

AB Aims: Aerobic rice is a potential crop introduced to encourage water conservation in rice planting. However, a decline of aerobic rice yield has been reported and thus this study was initiated with the aim to observe the response of microbial community in this environment which are exposed to various plant growth stage and soil types.
   Methodology and results: To determine the effect of soil types such as peat and sandy clay loam on microbial community. A total of four growth stages were tested namely vegetative, reproductive, ripening and maturing. To determine the influence of growth stages and soil types towards microbial community in aerobic rice, Biolog Ecoplate (TM) technique was used to quantify the response of microbial community through microbial functional diversity and carbon source utilization. The abundance of culturable aerobic bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, nitrogen-fixing microorganism and phosphate-solubilizing microorganism were determined using five different selective media. Soil physical and chemical properties as well as total nitrogen in plant tissues were also determined. It was found that microbial functional diversity during plant growth (except for microbial evenness) varied between the soil types. Correlation analysis revealed different relationships between carbon source utilization and microbial functional diversity in both soil types.
   Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Microbial community in rhizosphere responded according to plant development which is primarily determined by soil type. Therefore, it is concluded that soil type particularly the soil physical and chemical properties are important factors in shaping the microbial community by directly influencing the rhizosphere environment.

AB The antagonistic Trichoderma spp. isolates P1 and T3 differed in their ability to colonize and to compete in sphagnum peat moss and on wood chips. In peat supplemented with straw, isolate T3 produced twice as many colony forming units (cfu) as isolate P1. On wood chips, the two isolates formed a similar number of cfu. When the two Trichoderma isolates were cultivated together approximately 85-90% of the cfu were from T3 on both substrates. The presence of Pythium ultimum in peat amended with straw did not influence the number of Trichoderma cfu formed. The two Trichoderma isolates produced different amounts of hydrolytic enzymes both in liquid cultures and in peat. Seven different enzyme activities were tested. Enzyme production by T. harzianum isolate T3 was less influenced by the type of carbon source amendment than that of isolate T. atroviride P1. Culture filtrates of isolate P1 grown on complex carbon sources were high in endochitinase activity, whereas cellulase and endo-1,3-beta-glucanase activities were more pronounced in filtrates of isolate T3. There was no significant difference between the two isolates in their ability to protect cucumber seedlings against P. ultimum while the combination of the two fungi resulted in significantly less biocontrol than each isolate alone.

AB A(1) natural similar to 1450-yr global Holocene climate periodicity underlies a portion of the present global warming trend. Calibrated basal radiocarbon dates from 71 paludified peatlands across the western interior of Canada demonstrate that this periodicity regulated western Canadian peatland initiation. Peatlands, the largest terrestrial carbon pool, and their carbon-budgets are sensitive to hydrological fluctuations. The global atmospheric carbon-budget experienced corresponding fluctuations, as recorded in the Holocene atmospheric CO2 record from Taylor Dome, Antarctica. While the climate changes following this similar to 1450-yr periodicity were sufficient to affect the global carbon-budget, the resultant atmospheric CO2 fluctuations did not cause a runaway climate-CO2 feedback loop, This demonstrates that global carbon-budgets are sensitive to small climatic fluctuations; thus international agreements on greenhouse gasses need to take into account the natural carbon-budget imbalance of regions with large climatically sensitive carbon pools.

AB Reconstructions of atmospheric CO2 concentrations based on Antarctic ice cores(1,2) reveal significant changes during the Holocene epoch, but the processes responsible for these changes in CO2 concentrations have not been unambiguously identified. Distinct characteristics in the carbon isotope signatures of the major carbon reservoirs (ocean, biosphere, sediments and atmosphere) constrain variations in the CO2 fluxes between those reservoirs. Here we present a highly resolved atmospheric delta C-13 record for the past 11,000 years from measurements on atmospheric CO2 trapped in an Antarctic ice core. From mass-balance inverse model calculations(3,4) performed with a simplified carbon cycle model, we show that the decrease in atmospheric CO2 of about 5 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.). The increase in delta C-13 of about 0.25 parts per thousand during the early Holocene is most probably the result of a combination of carbon uptake of about 290 gigatonnes of carbon by the land biosphere and carbon release from the ocean in response to carbonate compensation of the terrestrial uptake during the termination of the last ice age. The 20 p.p.m.v. increase of atmospheric CO2 and the small decrease in delta C-13 of about 0.05 parts per thousand during the later Holocene can mostly be explained by contributions from carbonate compensation of earlier land-biosphere uptake and coral reef formation, with only a minor contribution from a small decrease of the land-biosphere carbon inventory.

AB Northern peatlands are a vital component of the global carbon cycle, containing large stores of soil organic carbon and acting as a long-term carbon sink. Moss productivity is an important factor in determining whether these wetlands will retain this function under future climatic conditions. Research on unsaturated water flow in peatlands, which controls moss productivity during periods of evaporative stress, has focused on relatively deep bog systems. However, shallower peatlands and marginal connective wetlands can be essential components of many landscape mosaics. In order to better understand factors influencing moss productivity, water balance simulations using HYDRUS-1D were run for different soil profile depths, compositions, and antecedent moisture conditions. Our results demonstrate a bimodal distribution of peatland realizations, either primarily conserving water by limiting evapotranspiration or maximizing moss productivity. For sustained periods of evaporative stress, both deep water storage and a shallow initial water table delay the onset of high vegetative stress, thus maximizing moss productivity. A total depth of sand and peat of 0.8m is identified as the threshold above which increasing peat depth has no effect on changing vegetative stress response. In contrast, wetlands with shallow peat deposits (less than 0.5m thick) are least able to buffer prolonged periods of evaporation due to limited labile water storage and will thus quickly experience vegetative stress and so limit evaporation and conserve water. With a predicted increase in the frequency and size of rain events in continental North America, the moss productivity of shallow wetland systems may increase, but also greater moisture availability will increase the likelihood they remain as wetlands in a changing climate.

AB Peatlands have persisted as massive carbon sinks over millennia, even during past periods of climate change. The commonly accepted theory of abiotic controls (mainly anoxia and low temperature) over carbon decomposition cannot fully explain how vast low-latitude shrub/tree dominated (wooded) peatlands consistently accrete peat under warm and seasonally unsaturated conditions. Here we show, by comparing the composition and ecological traits of microbes between Sphagnum- and shrub-dominated peatlands, that slow-growing microbes decisively dominate the studied shrub-dominated peatlands, concomitant with plant-induced increases in highly recalcitrant carbon and phenolics. The slow-growing microbes metabolize organic matter thirty times slower than the fast-growing microbes that dominate our Sphagnum-dominated site. We suggest that the high-phenolic shrub/tree induced shifts in microbial composition may compensate for positive effects of temperature and/or drought on metabolism over time in peatlands. This biotic self-sustaining process that modulates abiotic controls on carbon cycling may improve projections of long-term, climate-carbon feedbacks in peatlands. A dominance of slow-growing microbes reduces carbon loss in peatlands with predominantly woody vegetation and may help with peatland preservation under climate change, according to a comparison of microbial communities from different types of peatlands.

AB Net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) was measured with eddy covariance method for two adjacent forests located at the southern boundary of European taiga in Russia in 1999-2004. The two spruce forests shared similar vegetation composition but differed in soil conditions. The wet spruce forest (WSF) possessed a thick peat layer (60 cm) with a high water table seasonally close to or above the soil surface. The dry spruce forest (DSF) had a relatively thin organic layer (5 cm) with a deep water table (> 60 cm). The measured multi-year average NEE fluxes (2000 and 1440 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1) for WSF and DSF, respectively) indicated that WSF was a source while DSF a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during the experimental years. A process-based model, Forest-DNDC, was employed in the study to interpret the observations. The modeled multi-year average NEE fluxes were 1800 and -2200 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for WSF and DSF, respectively, which were comparable with observations. The modeled data also showed high soil heterotrophic respiration rates at WSF that suggested that the water table fluctuation at WSF could have played a key role in determining the negative carbon balance in the wetland ecosystem. A sensitivity test was conducted by running Forest-DNDC with varied water table scenarios for WSF. The results indicated that the NEE fluxes from WSF were highly sensitive to the water table depth. When the water table was high, the WSF ecosystem maintained as a sink of atmospheric CO2; while along with the drop of the water table the length of the flooded period reduced and more organic matter in the soil profile suffered from rapid decomposition that gradually converted the ecosystem into a source of atmospheric CO2. The general effect of water table variation on wetland carbon balance observed from this modeling study could be applicable for a wide range of wetland ecosystems that have accumulated soil organic carbon while face hydrological changes under certain climatic or land-use change scenarios.

AB Peatland biological, physical and chemical properties change over time in response to alterations in long-term water table position. Such changes complicate our ability to predict the response of peatland carbon stocks to sustained drying. In order to better understand the effect of sustained lowering of the water table on peatland carbon dynamics, we re-visited a drainage-affected bog, repeating eddy covariance measurements of CO2 flux after a 16-year interval. We found the ecosystem CO2 sink to have strengthened across the intervening period, despite a deep and fluctuating water table. This was mostly due to an increase in CO2 uptake through photosynthesis associated with increased shrub growth. We also observed a decline in CO2 loss through ecosystem respiration. These changes could not be attributed to environmental conditions. Air temperature was the only significant contemporaneous driver of monthly anomalies in CO2 fluxes, with higher temperatures decreasing the net CO2 sink via increased ecosystem respiration. However, the effect of air temperature was weak in comparison to the underlying differences between time periods. Therefore, we demonstrate that for drying peatlands, long-term changes within the ecosystem can be of primary importance as drivers of CO2 exchange. In this peatland, the ecosystem carbon sink has shown resilience to water table drawdown, with internal feedbacks leading to a recovery of the CO2 sink after a 16-year interval.

AB Acid mine drainage (AMD), which contains high concentrations of sulphate and dissolved metals, is a serious environmental problem. It can be treated in situ by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB), but effectiveness of the treatment process depends on the organic substrate chosen to supply the bacteria's carbon source. Six natural organic materials were characterized in order to investigate how well these promote sulphate reduction and metal precipitation by SRB. Maple wood chips, sphagnum peat moss, leaf compost, conifer compost, poultry manure and conifer sawdust were investigated in terms of their carbon (TOC, TIC, DOC) and nitrogen (TKN) content, as well as their easily available substances content (EAS). Single substrates, ethanol, a mixture of leaf compost (30% w/w), poultry manure (18% w/w), and maple wood chips (2% w/w), and the same mixture spiked with formaldehyde were then tested in a 70-day batch experiment to evaluate their performance in sulphate reduction and metal removal from synthetic AMD.
   Metal removal efficiency in batch reactors was as high as 100% for Fe, 99% for Mn, 99% for Cd, 99% for Ni, and 94% for Zn depending on reactive mixtures. Early metal removal (0-12 d) was attributed to the precipitation of (oxy)hydroxides and carbonate minerals. The lowest metal and sulphate removal efficiency was found in the reactor containing poultry manure as the single carbon source despite its high DOC and EAS content. The mixture of organic materials was most effective in promoting sulphate reduction, followed by ethanol and maple wood chips, and single natural organic substrates generally showed low reactivity. Formaldehyde (0.015% (w/v)) provided only temporary bacterial inhibition. Although characterization of substrates on an individual basis provided insight on their chemical make-up, it did not give a clear indication of their ability to promote sulphate reduction and metal removal.

AB Northern peatlands represent a long-term net sink for atmospheric CO2, but these ecosystems can shift from net carbon (C) sinks to sources based on changing climate and environmental conditions. In particular, changes in water availability associated with climate control peatland vegetation and carbon uptake processes. We examined the influence of changing hydrology on plant species abundance and ecosystem primary production in an Alaskan fen by manipulating the water table in field treatments to mimic either sustained flooding (raised water table) or drought (lowered water table) conditions for 6 years. We found that water table treatments altered plant species abundance by increasing sedge and grass cover in the raised water table treatment and reducing moss cover while increasing vascular green area in the lowered water table treatment. Gross primary productivity was lower in the lowered treatment than in the other plots, although there were no differences in total biomass or vascular net primary productivity among the treatments. Overall, our results indicate that vegetation abundance was more sensitive to variation in water table than total biomass and vascular biomass accrual. Finally, in our experimental peatland, drought had stronger consequences for change in vegetation abundance and ecosystem function than sustained flooding.

AB Based on theories of mire development and responses to a changing climate, the current role of mires as a net carbon sink has been questioned. A rigorous evaluation of the current net C-exchange in mires requires measurements of all relevant fluxes. Estimates of annual total carbon budgets in mires are still very limited. Here, we present a full carbon budget over 2 years for a boreal minerogenic oligotrophic mire in northern Sweden (64 degrees 11'N, 19 degrees 33'E). Data on the following fluxes were collected: land-atmosphere CO2 exchange (continuous Eddy covariance measurements) and CH4 exchange (static chambers during the snow free period); TOC (total organic carbon) in precipitation; loss of TOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH4 through stream water runoff (continuous discharge measurements and regular C-concentration measurements). The mire constituted a net sink of 27 +/- 3.4 (+/- SD) g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 20 +/- 3.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. This could be partitioned into an annual surface-atmosphere CO2 net uptake of 55 +/- 1.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 48 +/- 1.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. The annual NEE was further separated into a net uptake season, with an uptake of 92 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 86 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005, and a net loss season with a loss of 37 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2004 and 38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during 2005. Of the annual net CO2-C uptake, 37% and 31% was lost through runoff (with runoff TOC > DIC >> CH4) and 16% and 29% through methane emission during 2004 and 2005, respectively. This mire is still a significant C-sink, with carbon accumulation rates comparable to the long-term Holocene C-accumulation, and higher than the C-accumulation during the late Holocene in the region.

AB In the early phases of succession, the proportion of biomass comprising understorey vegetation may be considerable and, therefore, it plays a significant role in the annual nutrient and carbon cycling of forest ecosystems. The aim of our study was to identify the most significant forest-site attributes affecting the above-ground biomass of understorey vegetation and to develop models that can be used to predict this biomass in the boreal zone using readily available variables. The study was based on vegetation data consisted of percentage coverage observations collected from a network of permanent sample plots established by the National Forest Inventory in Finland. The coverage data were transformed to biomass with previously published models. According to our results, above-ground biomass can be predicted by such forest stand and site attributes as stand age and site nutrient level. In Scots pine, Norway spruce and broad-leaved forests growing on upland soil, the relative RMSE of predicted above-ground biomass of all understorey vegetation was 16.6%, 22.3% and 31.6%, respectively. In hardwood-spruce mires and paludified forests, the relative RMSE predicted above-ground biomass of all understorey vegetation was 12.2%. In pine mires it was 9.9%. The modelled relationship between biomass and forest site attributes can be used in ecosystem and carbon cycle modelling as a rapid non-destructive method to predict the above-ground biomass of understorey vegetation.

TI Impact of climate change on wetland ecosystems: A critical review of
   experimental wetlands
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Review
DE Climate chamber; Constructed wetland; Greenhouse gases; Mesocosm
   experiment; Peatland; Wetland management
AB Climate change is identified as a major threat to wetlands. Altered hydrology and rising temperature can change the biogeochemistry and function of a wetland to the degree that some important services might be turned into disservices. This means that they will, for example, no longer provide a water purification service and adversely they may start to decompose and release nutrients to the surface water. Moreover, a higher rate of decomposition than primary production (photosynthesis) may lead to a shift of their function from being a sink of carbon to a source. This review paper assesses the potential response of natural wetlands (peatlands) and constructed wetlands to climate change in terms of gas emission and nutrients release. In addition, the impact of key climatic factors such as temperature and water availability on wetlands has been reviewed. The authors identified the methodological gaps and weaknesses in the literature and then introduced a new framework for conducting a comprehensive mesocosm experiment to address the existing gaps in literature to support future climate change research on wetland ecosystems. In the future, higher temperatures resulting in drought might shift the role of both constructed wetland and peatland from a sink to a source of carbon. However, higher temperatures accompanied by more precipitation can promote photosynthesis to a degree that might exceed the respiration and maintain the carbon sink role of the wetland. There might be a critical water level at which the wetland can preserve most of its services. In order to find that level, a study of the key factors of climate change and their interactions using an appropriate experimental method is necessary. Some contradictory results of past experiments can be associated with different methodologies, designs, time periods, climates, and natural variability. Hence a long-term simulation of climate change for wetlands according to the proposed framework is recommended. This framework provides relatively more accurate and realistic simulations, valid comparative results, comprehensive understanding and supports coordination between researchers. This can help to find a sustainable management strategy for wetlands to be resilient to climate change.

AB This article reviews the existing conceptual and simulation models for peatlands and develops a model framework for simulating peatland dynamics in boreal regions. Clymo's peat bog growth model has been used as the conceptual foundation in published simulation models, but in these models the structural and functional layers of litter, acrotelm and catotelm are not dynamically integrated. Organic-matter decomposition processes in these layers operate at different rates over various time scales. The processes in more active litter and acrotelm layers largely pre-determine the net peat accumulation in the catotelm. On the basis of evaluating litter and peat-core data, we propose a model design that connects different layers through changing water-table depth, driven by effective moisture. The model framework includes single and double negative exponential decay functions that together produce net peat accumulation or degradation and hence carbon balance. The model is designed to be generic in structure, but can be validated using estimated parameters and observed peat accumulation data for continental western Canada. The objectives of this model exercise are (1) to understand the interactions of different biological and environmental factors in boreal peatlands, and (2) to realistically simulate peat accumulation and decay over the last several millennia using proxy paleoclimate data as drivers and peat profiles for validation.

AB The results of a long-term (1999-2007) investigation of vegetation productivity and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from the surface of an oligotrophic mire in southern taiga in Western Siberia are presented. The studied ecosystems include pine shrub-sphagnum (PSS) community, a similar community with oppressed ( low) tree stand (LPSS), and sedge-sphagnum fen (SSF). Net primary production for PSS, LPSS and SSF are equal to 552, 575, and 561 g m(-2) yr(-1). The mean respiration during the snow-free season determined by chamber method is 165.8, 105.6, 112.4 mgCO(2) m(-2) h(-1) for PSS, LPSS and SSF, respectively. Field measurements of NPP and CO2 emission in combination with reference data on methane emission, winter CO2 and CH4 emissions and carbon export by river run-off were used to develop an overall carbon budget of the mire ecosystems. At present conditions the studied mire ecosystems are net sinks for atmospheric carbon and accumulate peat. Rates of the actual modern carbon accumulation are equal to 21, 112 and 102 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for PSS, LPSS and SSF communities.

AB Fens and bogs are distinct in terms of their biogeochemistry, water table behavior, and net peat-accumulation regimes. While most peatlands start developing as fens, a large fraction of them eventually shift to bogs in a step-like ecosystem shift. This transition has traditionally been assumed to be primarily controlled by the ecosystem itself (autogenic control). Here we use 90 peat profiles from southernmost South America (SSA) as a case study that illustrates a synchronous, regional-scale shift from fen to bog around 4200 years ago. In light of these results, we propose and discuss conceptual models that link environmental change (allogenic control) as a trigger to the fen-bog transition (FBT). In addition, our stratigraphic analyses show thatSphagnumdeposits are associated with greater peat masses, larger soil-carbon stocks, and higher rates of peat-carbon accumulation than their non-Sphagnumcounterparts, withSphagnumbogs being characterized by soil-carbon densities over twice that of non-Sphagnumpeatlands (medians = 141 vs. 56 kgC/m(2)). Since fens and bogs also behave differently in terms of their carbon exchanges with the atmosphere, a better appraisal of the processes involved in the FBT could help elucidate the role of this critical ecosystem shift in the past and future global carbon cycle.

AB Large CO2 evasion to the atmosphere occurs as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is transported from soils to streams. While this physical process has been the focus of multiple studies, less is known about the underlying biogeochemical transformations that accompany this transfer of C from soils to streams. Here we used patterns in stream water and groundwater C-13-DIC values within three headwater catchments with contrasting land cover to identify the sources and processes regulating DIC during its transport. We found that although considerable CO2 evasion occurs as DIC is transported from soils to streams, there were also other processes affecting the DIC pool. Methane production and mixing of C sources, associated with different types and spatial distribution of peat-rich areas within each catchment, had a significant influence on the C-13-DIC values in both soils and streams. These processes represent an additional control on C-13-DIC values and the catchment-scale cycling of DIC across different northern landscape types. The results from this study demonstrate that the transport of DIC from soils to streams results in more than just rapid CO2 evasion to the atmosphere but also represents a channel of C transformation, which questions some of our current conceptualizations of C cycling at the landscape scale.
   Plain Language Summary Large carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere occurs as rainwater percolates through soils and into streams. This physical process is important for the global carbon cycle and has been the focus of multiple studies. However, less is known about the underlying processes that accompanies this transfer of carbon dioxide from soils to streams. Here we analyze the stable isotope composition of soil and stream carbon dioxide and demonstrate that methane production and mixing of carbon sources also occur in soils and streams. These processes were linked to different types and configurations of peat-rich areas, for example, bogs, fens, and riparian zones, found within each of the three studied catchments. Our results therefore demonstrate that the export of carbon dioxide from soils to streams not only results in emissions to the atmosphere but also represents a channel of transformation. This questions some of our current conceptualization of the catchment-scale cycling of carbon dioxide.

AB There is widespread interest in estimating annual carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) budgets for peatlands using data collected from flux chambers. Flux-chamber measurements are a snapshot of the conditions on a particular site and may not adequately represent fluxes between measurements. However, these measurements can be used in simple models to estimate time-integrated fluxes of CO2 and CH4. This paper reviews modelling approaches used for estimating such time-integrated fluxes and provides what we hope is a 'one-stop-shop' for new researchers, such as PhD students, considering using such models. The review is written for those with a non-mathematical background.

AB As an important terrestrial carbon reservoir, peatland has the potential to influence the global carbon cycle and global climate. In recent decades, the frequency and extent of peatland wildfires in boreal and tropical regions are increasing owing to climate change and human activity. However, the processes that govern changes in peatland wildfire are poorly understood over long timescales, particularly on the orbital scales. We analyzed coal petrology and geochemistry in coal seams of the Aalenian Yan'an Formation in Ordos Basin to identify peatland wildfire records based on the co-occurrence of charcoal and pyrolytic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In addition, the presence of widespread peatland wildfires has suggested that atmospheric oxygen concentration at the time should be substantially higher than the minimum needed for sustained combustion. Spectral analysis of vitrinite/inertinite (V/I) and inertinite reflectance data demonstrate that peatland wildfires were controlled by precession cycles owing to a shift in the seasonal contrast and amount of rainfall. Our results provide essential context for understanding the importance of peatland wildfires carbon emissions in a coupling of orbital forcing, climate, and the carbon cycle.

A considerable fraction of this carbon pool is currently in permafrost and is biogeochemically relatively inert; this will change with increasing soil temperatures as a result of climate warming in the 21st century. We use a geospatially explicit representation of peat areas and peat depth from a recently-compiled database and a geothermal model to estimate northern North America soil temperature responses to predicted changes in air temperature. We find that, despite a widespread decline in the areas classified as permafrost, soil temperatures in peatlands respond more slowly to increases in air temperature owing to the insulating properties of peat. We estimate that an additional 670 km(3) of peat soils in North America, containing similar to 33 Pg C, could be seasonally thawed by the end of the century, representing similar to 20% of the total peat volume in Alaska and Canada. Warming conditions result in a lengthening of the soil thaw period by similar to 40 days, averaged over the model domain. These changes have potentially important implications for the carbon balance of peat soils.

AB Organic soils are an important substrate for cycling carbon between terrestrial and atmospheric pools. The degree of decomposition of organic soil material influences the physical and chemical characteristics that control the carbon cycles in these soils. Although organic soils are abundant in southeast Alaska, little information is available on the state of decomposition or variability within organic soil mapping units. Determination of physical (fiber content) and chemical (sodium pyrophosphate extract color, SPEC) decomposition is used to classify organic soils and subsequently establish map units. The purpose of this study is to provide physical and chemical decomposition data to better characterize and classify, forested organic soils in southeast Alaska and to improve our understanding of the distribution of fiber within these soils. Fiber content and pyrophosphate color were determined on 115 samples from 23 organic soils from throughout the Tongass National Forest. These samples show that complexes of hemic and sapric suborders mapped in the Tongass Soil Survey are dominantly hemic. Some Fiber analyses differ considerably from statements in descriptions of established series in the Tongass Soil Survey. Physical decomposition of the fibers is in the hemic range, but chemical decomposition indicated by SPEC is sapric due to accumulation of soluble organic matter by water movement down steep slopes as well as in situ decomposition. Suborder classes provide a means to incorporate appropriate decomposition levels into existing soil series.

AB Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are designed for the study of past, present and future vegetation patterns together with associated biogeochemical cycles and climate feedbacks. However, most DGVMs do not yet have detailed representations of permafrost and non-permafrost peatlands, which are an important store of carbon, particularly at high latitudes. We demonstrate a new implementation of peatland dynamics in a customized "Arctic" version of the LPJ-GUESS DGVM, simulating the long-term evolution of selected northern peatland ecosystems and assessing the effect of changing climate on peatland carbon balance. Our approach employs a dynamic multi-layer soil with representation of freeze-thaw processes and litter inputs from a dynamically varying mixture of the main peatland plant functional types: mosses, shrubs and graminoids. The model was calibrated and tested for a sub-Arctic mire in Stordalen, Sweden, and validated at a temperate bog site in Mer Bleue, Canada. A regional evaluation of simulated carbon fluxes, hydrology and vegetation dynamics encompassed additional locations spread across Scandinavia. Simulated peat accumulation was found to be generally consistent with published data and the model was able to capture reported long-term vegetation dynamics, water table position and carbon fluxes. A series of sensitivity experiments were carried out to investigate the vulnerability of high-latitude peatlands to climate change. We found that the Stordalen mire may be expected to sequester more carbon in the first half of the 21st century due to milder and wetter climate conditions, a longer growing season, and the CO2 fertilization effect, turning into a carbon source after mid-century because of higher decomposition rates in response to warming soils.

AB Northern peatlands are substantial carbon sinks because organic matter in peat is highly stable due to the low rate of decomposition. Waterlogged anaerobic conditions induce accumulation of Sphagnum-derived phenolic compounds that inhibit peat organic matter decomposition, a mechanism referred to as the "enzymic latch". Recent studies have predicted that the water table in northern peatlands may become unstable. We observed that such unstable water table levels can impede the development of Sphagnum mosses. In this study, we determined the effects of low and high frequency water table fluctuation regimes on Sphagnum growth and peat organic matter decomposition, by conducting a year-long mesocosm experiment. In addition, we conducted a molecular analysis to examine changes in abundance of fungal community which may play a key role in the decomposition of organic matter in peatlands. We found that rapid water table fluctuation inhibited the growth of Sphagnum due to fungal infection but stimulated decomposition of organic matter that may dramatically destabilize peatland carbon storage. Increased pH, induced by the fluctuation, may contribute to the enhanced activity of hydrolases in peat. We demonstrated that the water table fluctuation in peatlands impeded Sphagnum growth and accelerates decomposition due to fungal proliferation. Thus, we suggested that understanding the microbial community in the northern peatlands is essential for elucidating the possible changes in carbon cycle of peatland under the changing world.

AB A vast number of organic compounds are present in soil organic matter (SOM) and play an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, facilitate interactions between organisms, and represent a sink for atmospheric CO2. The diversity of different SOM compounds and their molecular characteristics is a function of the organic source material and biogeochemical history. By understanding how SOM composition changes with sources and the processes by which it is biogeochemically altered in different terrestrial ecosystems, it may be possible to predict nutrient and carbon cycling, response to system perturbations, and impact of climate change will have on SOM composition. In this study, a sequential chemical extraction procedure was developed to reveal the diversity of organic matter (OM) in different ecosystems and was compared to the previously published protocol using parallel solvent extraction (PSE). We compared six extraction methods using three sample types, peat soil, spruce forest soil and river sediment, so as to select the best method for extracting a representative fraction of organic matter from soils and sediments from a wide range of ecosystems. We estimated the extraction yield of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by total organic carbon analysis, and measured the composition of extracted OM using high resolution mass spectrometry. This study showed that OM composition depends primarily on soil and sediment characteristics. Two sequential extraction protocols, progressing from polar to non-polar solvents, were found to provide the highest number and diversity of organic compounds extracted from the soil and sediments. Water (H2O) is the first solvent used for both protocols followed by either co-extraction with methanol-chloroform (MeOH-CHCl3) mixture, or acetonitrile (ACN) and CHCl3 sequentially. The sequential extraction protocol developed in this study offers improved sensitivity, and requires less sample compared to the PSE workflow where a new sample is used for each solvent type. Furthermore, a comparison of SOM composition from the different sample types revealed that our sequential protocol allows for ecosystem comparisons based on the diversity of compounds present, which in turn could provide new insights about source and processing of organic compounds in different soil and sediment types.

AB It is widely known that peatlands are a significant carbon (C) stock. Most peatlands are located in boreal and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere but some occur also at high altitude and, contrary to the first; their contribution in terms of carbon sequestration is far less studied. In the Alps, there are numerous small peatlands, which are threatened by increasing temperatures and an alteration of their water balance. The aim of this study was to investigate the carbon fluxes of a small-scale fen in the Alps over three years (2012-2014).
   During the study period, the peatland experienced a high interannual variation in weather conditions while it acted as a carbon source based on CO2 emissions (NEE: 180.7 +/- 65.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) for all three years. This was mainly due to the short net C uptake period (73 7 days) and high respiration. Ecosystem respiration and summer gross primary production were both very high compared to other peatlands around the world and compared to a nearby low productive grassland. In wintertime, the soil did not freeze, resulting in a slow decomposition of the organic matter. Low methane fluxes were recorded during a 10-month measurement campaign, for a total of 3.2 g C-CH4 m(-2) over the December 2013-September 2014 period. Our findings suggest that the interannual variability of temperature and soil water content exert a strong influence on the carbon balance of peatlands of the Alps and that could further worsen depending upon the magnitude of climate change.

AB Artificial drainage for agriculture causes the alteration of peatlands through excessive oxidation and fires. Peats lose their functions and also contribute to the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. In this study, morphological, micro morphological and chemical soil characteristics of an artificially drained peat land located in the southern Turkey were investigated to assess the effects of excessive oxidation and fire. Soil samples described as sapric, hemic, or burnt were collected along four transects on the peatland. The results clearly indicated that burning process resulted in significant decrease in total carbon and nitrogen content of soils since 1950 whereas pH, ash content, available P and K contents were increased. Interpretations recognized as a degradation sequence after drainage. The results demonstrated that artificial drainage of peatlands for agricultural purposes leads to a change in organic soil properties. The carbon and nitrogen sink were depleted, C by about 2 x 10(6) and N by about 0.1 x 10(6) tons, and pH was raised above the level that is ideal for cropping, in a system that is not only completed changed but unsustainable without increasing soil inputs in the long term.

AB Northern wetlands with organic soil i.e., mires are significant carbon storages. This key ecosystem service may be threatened by anthropogenic activities and climate change, yet we still lack a consensus on how these major changes affects their carbon sink capacities. We studied how forestry drainage and restoration combined with experimental warming, impacts greenhouse gas fluxes of wetlands with peat. We measured CO2 and CH4 during two and N2O fluxes during one growing season using the chamber method.
   Gas fluxes were primarily controlled by water table, leaf area and temperature. Land use had a clear impact of on CO2 exchange. Forestry drainage increased respiration rates and decreased field layer net ecosystem CO2 uptake (NEE) and leaf area index (LAI), while at restoration sites the flux rates and LAI had recovered to the level of undrained sites. CH4 emissions were exceptionally low at all sites during our study years due to natural drought, but still somewhat lower at drained compared to undrained sites. Moderate warming triggered an increase in LAI across all land use types. This was accompanied by an increase in cumulative seasonal NEE. Restoration appeared to be an effective tool to return the ecosystem functions of these wetlands as we found no differences in LAI or any gas flux components (PMAX, Reco, NEE, CH4 or N2O) between restored and undrained sites. We did not find any signs that moderate warming would compromise the return of the ecosystem functions related to C sequestration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nutrient-poor organic soils under maritime grassland are often located in remote wet locations in the landscape. Leaving these soils without drainage maintenance often raise the water table but continuous management (grazing) means they could remain a source of carbon dioxide (CO2) while also turning into a small source of methane (CH4). Due to geographical and socio-economic reasons, removing these sites from agricultural production may be an option to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To test this hypothesis we measured GHG fluxes over a four year period, at a drained and a rewetted organic soil under grassland, which were both grazed for the first two years and not grazed for the following two years. Statistical response functions estimated for gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) were used to reconstruct annual CO2-C balances using site-specific models driven by soil temperature, solar radiation, soil water table (WT) and leaf area index (LAI). Annually, soil CO2 emissions were comparable when grazed, although the rewetted site had a lower net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) despite displaying higher CH4 emissions. Both sites have lower CO2 emissions than typical drained organic soils due to management practices: extensive grazing, no fertilisation and mean annual water tables above-25 cm. When grazing stopped, GPP and Reco increased dramatically driven by vigorous growth of vegetation at both sites. The shallow drained site remained a source of CO2 and small source of CH4 while the rewetted site became either neutral or a small sink of CO2 with decreased CH4 emissions compared to the grazing period. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were negligible at either site. Removing grazing significantly reduced the NECB at both sites but in terms of global warming potential (GWP), the greatest GHG mitigation was in the rewetted site which exerted a cooling effect in the second year after the management shift.

AB The area under the cultivation of perennial bioenergy crops on organic soils in the northern countries is fast increasing. To understand the impact of reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinaceae L.) cultivation on the carbon dioxide (CO2) balance of an organic soil, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was measured for four years in a RCG cultivated cutover peatland in eastern Finland using the eddy covariance technique. There were striking differences among the years in the annual precipitation. The annual precipitation was higher during 2004 and 2007 and lower during 2005 and 2006 than the 1971-2000 regional mean. During wet growing seasons, moderate temperatures, high surface soil moisture and low evaporative demand favoured high CO2 uptake. During dry seasons, owing to soil moisture and atmospheric stress, photosynthetic activity was severely restricted. The CO2 uptake [gross primary productivity (GPP)] was positively correlated with soil moisture, air temperature and inversely with vapour pressure deficit. Total ecosystem respiration (TER) increased with increasing soil temperature but decreased with increasing soil moisture. The relative responses of GPP and TER to moisture stress were different. While changes in TER for a given change in soil moisture were moderate, variations in GPP were drastic. Also, the seasonal variations in TER were not as conspicuous as those in GPP implying that GPP is the primary regulator of the interannual variability in NEE in this ecosystem. The ecosystem accumulated a total of 398 g Cm-2 from the beginning of 2004 until the end of 2007. It retained some carbon during a wet year such as 2004 even after accounting for the loss of carbon in the form of harvested biomass. Based on this CO2 balance analysis, RCG cultivation is found to be a promising after-use option on an organic soil.

AB Peatlands represent globally significant soil carbon stores that have been accumulating for millennia under water-logged conditions. However, deepening water-table depths (WTD) from climate change or human-induced drainage could stimulate decomposition resulting in peatlands turning from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Contemporary WTD ranges of testate amoebae (TA) are commonly used to predict past WTD in peatlands using quantitative transfer function models. Here we present, for the first time, a study comparing TA-based WTD reconstructions to instrumentally monitored WTD and hydrological model predictions using the MILLENNIA peatland model to examine past peatland responses to climate change and land management. Although there was very good agreement between monitored and modeled WTD, TA-reconstructed water table was consistently deeper. Predictions from a larger European TA transfer function data set were wetter, but the overall directional fit to observed WTD was better for a TA transfer function based on data from northern England. We applied a regression-based offset correction to the reconstructed WTD for the validation period (1931-2010). We then predicted WTD using available climate records as MILLENNIA model input and compared the offset-corrected TA reconstruction to MILLENNIA WTD predictions over an extended period (1750-1931) with available climate reconstructions. Although the comparison revealed striking similarities in predicted overall WTD patterns, particularly for a recent drier period (1965-1995), there were clear periods when TA-based WTD predictions underestimated (i.e. drier during 1830-1930) and overestimated (i.e. wetter during 1760-1830) past WTD compared to MILLENNIA model predictions. Importantly, simulated grouse moor management scenarios may explain the drier TA WTD predictions, resulting in considerable model predicted carbon losses and reduced methane emissions, mainly due to drainage. This study demonstrates the value of a site-specific and combined data-model validation step toward using TA-derived moisture conditions to understand past climate-driven peatland development and carbon budgets alongside modeling likely management impacts.

AB Peatland streams typically contain high methane concentrations and act as conduits for the release of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon analysis provides a unique tracer that can be used to identify the methane source, and quantify the time elapsed between carbon fixation and return to the atmosphere as CH4. Few studies - those that have focus largely on sites with bubble (ebullition) emissions - have investigated the C-14 age of methane in surface waters because of the difficulty in collecting sufficient CH4 for analysis. Here, we describe new sampling methods for the collection of CH4 samples from CH4-oversaturated peatland streams for radiocarbon analysis. We report the results of a suite of tests, including using methane C-14 standards and replicated field measurements, to verify the methods. The methods are not restricted to ebullition sites, and can be applied to peatland streams with lower methane concentrations. We report the C-14 age of methane extracted from surface water samples (4-13l) at two contrasting locations in a temperate raised peat bog. Results indicate substantial spatial variation with ages ranging from 400 (ditch in afforested peatland) to 3000years BP (bog perimeter stream). These contrasting ages suggest that methane in stream water can be derived from a wide range of peat depths. This new method provides a rapid (10-15min per sample) and convenient approach, which should make (CH4)-C-14 dating of surface water more accessible and lead to an increased understanding of carbon cycling within the soil-water-atmosphere system.

AB Vegetation succession is known to affect carbon-cycling patterns of recovering cutover peatlands, displayed as shifts in emissions of the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4. However, the related plant-microbe interactions are still poorly understood. We aimed to link the recovery of the organisms responsible for CH4 turnover, the methanogens and the methanotrophs, to the re-vegetation related compositional changes of three functional plant types (Sphagna, sedges and shrubs). In peat layers, the Sphagnum coverage was the most influential factor for the activity, abundance and community structures of both these microbial groups, demonstrating a succession pattern towards a pristine stage. Analysis of mcrA and pmoA genes revealed Methanoregulaceae and Methylocystis as the most dominant methanogens and methanotrophs, respectively. The relatively fast recovery of both CH4 production and oxidation in the peat layers supports earlier flux based results from these same fen-type peatland sites. In contrast to peat, CH4 oxidation in living Sphagnum mosses appeared to be independent of vegetation succession as CH4 oMdation potential was similar throughout the succession stages. This indicated that Sphagnum may be a valuable CH4 biofilter especially in the early re-vegetation stages when the oxidation in the peat has not yet recovered. Therefore, we recommend Sphagnum transplantation as a tool for climate friendly peatland restoration with faster recovery of the carbon sink ftmction and altered CH4 emissions.

AB Mechanisms controlling CO2 and CH4 production in wetlands are central to understanding carbon cycling and greenhouse gas exchange. However, the volatility of these respiration products complicates quantifying their rates of production in the field. Attempts to circumvent the challenges through closed system incubations, from which gases cannot escape, have been used to investigate bulk in situ geochemistry. Efforts towards mapping mechanistic linkages between geochemistry and microbiology have raised concern regarding sampling and incubation-induced perturbations. Microorganisms are impacted by oxygen exposure, increased temperatures and accumulation of metabolic products during handling, storage, and incubation. We probed the extent of these perturbations, and their influence on incubation results, using high-resolution geochemical and microbial gene-based community profiling of anaerobically incubated material from three wetland habitats across a permafrost peatland. We compared the original field samples to the material anaerobically incubated over 50 days. Bulk geochemistry and phylum-level microbiota in incubations largely reflected field observations, but divergence between field and incubations occurred in both geochemistry and lineage-level microbial composition when examined at closer resolution. Despite the changes in representative lineages over time, inferred metabolic function with regards to carbon cycling largely reproduced field results suggesting functional consistency. Habitat differences among the source materials remained the largest driver of variation in geochemical and microbial differences among the samples in both incubations and field results. While incubations may have limited usefulness for identifying specific mechanisms, they remain a viable tool for probing bulk-scale questions related to anaerobic C cycling, including CO2 and CH4 dynamics.

AB Detailed carbon budgets from 2008 to 2010 were created for two 1-ha flow-through riverine wetlands created in 1994 adjacent to a third-order stream in central Ohio. Measurements were taken of dissolved non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), fine particulate organic carbon (FPOM), and coarse particulate organic carbon (CPOM). Methane emissions, soil sequestration, aquatic primary productivity, and macrophyte aboveground net primary productivity were also included in the carbon budget. The carbon budget successfully balanced inputs (1838 +/- 41 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and export/sequestration (1846 +/- 59 g C m(-2) year(-1)) with only a 0.5 % over estimation of export in relation to input; 12.8 % of the inflow was sequestered into the wetland soil. FPOM and CPOM concentrations and exports were positively correlated with hydrologic flow under most circumstances; NPOC and DIC concentrations were usually negatively or poorly correlated with hydrologic flow. In all seasons, except winter, the change of total carbon (NPOC, DIC, FPOM, and CPOM) concentration between inflow and outflow increased with increased hydrologic flow. Although carbon concentrations increased from inflow to outflow, the total surface water export of carbon is less than the inflow due to groundwater recharge from these perched wetlands.

TI An unexpected role for mixotrophs in the response of peatland carbon
   cycling to climate warming

AB Mixotrophic protists are increasingly recognized for their significant contribution to carbon (C) cycling. As phototrophs they contribute to photosynthetic C fixation, whilst as predators of decomposers, they indirectly influence organic matter decomposition. Despite these direct and indirect effects on the C cycle, little is known about the responses of peatland mixotrophs to climate change and the potential consequences for the peatland C cycle. With a combination of field and microcosm experiments, we show that mixotrophs in the Sphagnum bryosphere play an important role in modulating peatland C cycle responses to experimental warming. We found that five years of consecutive summer warming with peaks of +2 to +8 degrees C led to a 50% reduction in the biomass of the dominant mixotrophs, the mixotrophic testate amoebae (MTA). The biomass of other microbial groups (including decomposers) did not change, suggesting MTA to be particularly sensitive to temperature. In a microcosm experiment under controlled conditions, we then manipulated the abundance of MTA, and showed that the reported 50% reduction of MTA biomass in the field was linked to a significant reduction of net C uptake (-13%) of the entire Sphagnum bryosphere. Our findings suggest that reduced abundance of MTA with climate warming could lead to reduced peatland C fixation.

AB Understanding and quantifying soil respiration and its component fluxes are necessary to model global carbon cycling in a changing climate as small changes in soil CO2 fluxes could have important implications for future climatic conditions. A soil respiration partitioning study was conducted in eight afforested peatland sites in south-west Ireland. Using trenched points, annual soil CO2 emissions, and the contributions of root and heterotrophic respiration as components of total soil respiration, were estimated. Nonlinear regression models were evaluated to determine the best predictive soil respiration model for each component flux, using soil temperature and water table level as explanatory variables. Temporal variation in soil CO2 efflux was driven by soil temperature at 10cm depth, with all treatment points also affected by water table level fluctuations. The effect of water table level on soil respiration was best accounted for by incorporating a water level Gaussian function into the soil-temperature-soil-respiration model. Mean root respiration was 44% of mean total soil respiration, varying between 1100 and 2049g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). Heterotrophic respiration was divided between peat respiration and litter respiration, which accounted for 35 and 21% of total soil respiration, respectively. While peat respiration varied between 774 and 1492g CO2 m(-2) year(-1), litter respiration varied between 514 and 1013g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). Although the extrapolation of these results to other sites should be done with caution, the empirical models developed for the entire dataset in this study are a useful tool to predict and simulate CO2 emissions in similar afforested peatlands (e.g. pine and spruce plantations) in temperate maritime climate conditions.

AB Peatlands store roughly one-third of the terrestrial soil carbon and release the, potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, making these wetlands among the most important ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Despite their importance, the controls of anaerobic decomposition of organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 within peatlands are not well understood. It is known, however, that the enzymes responsible for CH4 production require cobalt, iron and nickel, and there is a growing appreciation for the potential role of trace metal limitation in anaerobic decomposition. To explore the possibility of trace metal limitation in peatlands, we washed 3 peat soils with either PbCl2, to remove available trace metals, or distilled water. Following these washes, we added trace metals (as CoCl2, CuCl2, FeCl2, PbCl2 and NiCl2) to each soil. We measured anaerobic CH4 and CO2 production in laboratory incubations over 4 weeks before adding glucose as a labile carbon source and measuring CH4 and CO2 production for an additional 4 weeks. In all 3 soils, neither CH4 nor CO2 production were limited by individual trace metals, even following the wash with PbCl2 to remove available metals. Further, in response to the addition of a labile carbon substrate, all soils supported increased rates of CH4 and CO2 production without progressive trace metal limitation. Taken together, our findings suggest that individual trace metals may not be limiting to anaerobic decomposition in many peatland soils.

AB A multiple substrate induced respiration (SIR) assay, using C-14-labelled carbon sources, was used to evaluate community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of the microbial community in peat horizons of differing degrees of humification. The separation and grouping of the peat horizons by CLPP was similar to the pattern produced by analysis of the organic carbon chemistry of the peat horizons by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and therefore reflected the level of decomposition. Partial redundancy analysis showed that a large proportion (68.7%) of the variability in the CLPP data could be attributed to the ratio of polysaccharide to 'carboxylate' FTIR bands alone. The multiple substrate SIR technique may, therefore, be a powerful technique to further elucidate the influence of the microbial constituent of peat on the potential activity and patterns of cycling of labile carbon in peatlands.

AB Species composition affects the carbon turnover and the formation and emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) in wetlands. Here we investigate the individual effects of vascular plant species on the carbon cycling in a wetland ecosystem. We used a novel combination of laboratory methods and controlled environment facilities and studied three different vascular plant species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex rostrata and Juncus effusus) collected from the same wetland in southern Sweden. We found distinct differences in the functioning of these wetland sedges in terms of their effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 fluxes, bubble emission of CH4, decomposition of C-14-labelled acetate into (CH4)-C-14 and (CO2)-C-14, rhizospheric oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and stimulation of methanogenesis through root exudation of substrate ( e. g., acetate). The results show that the emission of CH4 from peat - plant monoliths was highest when the vegetation was dominated by Carex (6.76 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) than when it was dominated by Eriophorum (2.38 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) or Juncus (2.68 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Furthermore, the CH4 emission seemed controlled primarily by the degree of rhizospheric CH4 oxidation which was between 20 and 40% for Carex but > 90% for both the other species. Our results point toward a direct and very important linkage between the plant species composition and the functioning of wetland ecosystems and indicate that changes in the species composition may alter important processes relating to controls of and interactions between greenhouse gas fluxes with significant implications for feedback mechanisms in a changing climate as a result.

AB Peatlands play a major role in the global carbon cycle but are largely overlooked in current large-scale vegetation mapping efforts. In this study, we investigated the potential of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to capture the extent and distribution of peatlands in the St. Petersburg region of Russia by analyzing the relationships between peatland cover fractions derived from reference maps and similar to 1-km resolution MODIS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data from year 2002. First, we characterized and mapped 50 peatlands from forest inventory and peat deposit inventory data. The peatlands represent three major nutritional types (oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic) and different sizes (0.6-7800 ha). In addition, parts of 6 peatlands were mined for peat and these were mapped separately. The reference maps provided information on peatland cover for 1105 MODIS pixels. We performed regression analysis on 50% of the pixels and reserved the remainder for model validation. Canonical correlation analysis on the MODIS reflectance bands and the peatland cover fractions produced a multi-spectral peatland cover index (PCI), which served as the predictor in a reduced major axis (RMA) regression model. The results suggest a high potential for mapping peatlands with MODIS. The RMA regression models explained much of the variance in the PCI (r(2)=0.74 for mined and r(2)=0.81 for unmined peatlands). Model validation showed high correlation between observed versus predicted peatland cover (mined: r=0.87; unmined: r=0.92). We used the models to derive peatland cover estimates for the St. Petersburg region and compared the results to current MODIS land cover maps. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1] Peatland drainage and peat extraction changes natural peatlands from a net carbon sink to that of a large net source due to increased respiration and the removal of carbon dioxide ( CO(2)) fixing vegetation. Restoration of these altered peatland ecosystems is being applied to reduce these carbon emissions. As peatland restoration is a new and emerging land-use management practice, the purpose of this research was to examine the impact of restoration on the methane ( CH(4)) component of the carbon cycle at the Bois-des-Bel peatland located near Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec from early May to mid October for several years. The seasonal CH(4) fluxes prior to restoration at an extracted ( cutover) and a restored peatland were not significantly different from each other or zero. However, three years postrestoration the seasonal CH(4) emissions at the restored site were 4.2 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1), 4.6 times greater than the cutover site. Ponds and ditches at the restored site were seasonal CH(4) emission hot spots ( 0.3 and 2.9 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1), respectively); however, emissions from herbaceous vegetation ( 1.0 g m(-2) CH(4) season(-1)) were the dominant source of CH(4) from the restored peatland due to its large areal extent. CH(4) fluxes from the Bois-des-Bel peatland represented 14% of the total CO(2)-equivalent losses from the site. This study demonstrates the importance of vegetation succession on peatland-atmosphere flux of CH(4).

AB Retired farmland restoration is increasingly seen as a valuable opportunity to improve ecosystem functions in sensitive regions. For example, with expected mass retirement of cranberry farms in New England, there is increasing interest in restoring retired cranberry farms back to wetlands. To understand how restoration of retired cranberry farms to wetland ecosystems influences climate-related ecosystem functions, we assessed methane and carbon dioxide emissions from different post-farming management options, including an actively farmed cranberry bog, young and old retired cranberry bogs, young and old restored cranberry bogs, and a natural reference bog. In addition to methane and carbon dioxide, we measured key soil properties influential in greenhouse gas flux, including soil organic matter, moisture, pH, redox potential, and bulk density. Greenhouse gas flux differed significantly by site type, with the restored systems functioning similarly to the natural reference wetland while retired sites had fluxes similar to the actively farmed site. The older restored site had significantly lower emissions of both methane and carbon dioxide than the newly restored site, indicating that over a larger time scale, restored systems may transition from net carbon dioxide sources to sinks. Overall, the results of this study suggest that in addition to the many other ecological benefits, the restoration of wetlands may also play a role in climate change mitigation through their ability to store carbon.

AB Microbes play crucial roles in global carbon cycles, particularly in peatland ecosystems that store vast quantities of carbon. Boreal peatlands are under stress from commercial extraction of peat, drainage for conversion to forestry and agricultural lands, and climate change. In this study, we identify key microbial groups and their ecological functions across peatland depth profiles and provide insight into how environmental changes related to water table may alter microbial communities. We examined the diversity and composition of prokaryotic communities across a microtopographic hummock-hollow gradient using Illumina sequencing. Communities formed a gradient of species and functional groups with depth, with overlap in functional groups at lower layers of hummocks and upper layers of hollows. Yet, overall, we found significantly different prokaryotic communities in hollows than hummocks. Surfaces of hummocks were typified by aerobic chemoorganotrophs, methanotrophs and chemoheterotrophs, mid-depths were typified by aerobic chemoorganotrophs, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and anaerobic nitrate reducers, while lower depths in hollows were typified by anaerobic and facultative anaerobic chemoorganotrophs, nitrate reducers and methanogenic archaea. Microbial composition as a function of hydrology and moisture regimes suggests that environmental changes that alter hydrological regimes (e.g., climate change, peatland draining) may alter carbon and nutrient cycling regimes.

AB Knowledge of peatland initiation, accumulation, and decline or cessation is critical in understanding peatland development and the related carbon source/sink effect. In this study, we investigated the development of three peat profiles along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (ETP) and compared the results with those of our previous work along this transect. Our work showed that the initiation over the northern ETP is later and the slowdown/cessation earlier than in the middle to southern ETP. The timing of optimum peatland formation over the northern ETP lags the Holocene climatic optimum. These spatio-temporal differences are likely to be related to the intensity of Asian summer monsoon. Our work suggests that some peatlands along the ETP transect have returned or are now returning their previously captured carbon to the atmosphere and thus act as carbon sources. Some peatlands still have net accumulation at present, but the rates have been reduced concomitant with the decreasing summer monsoon intensity. We speculate that more of the previously stored carbon in the ETP peatlands will be re-emitted to the atmosphere if the aridity continues, as might occur under a continuous global-warming scenario.

AB Although microbes mediate much of the biogeochemical cycling in freshwater, the categories of carbon and nutrients currently used in models of freshwater biogeochemical cycling are too broad to be relevant on a microbial scale. One way to improve these models is to incorporate microbial data. Here, we analyze both genes and genomes from three metagenomic time series and propose specific roles for microbial taxa in freshwater biogeochemical cycles. Our metagenomic time series span multiple years and originate from a eutrophic lake (Lake Mendota) and a humic lake (Trout Bog Lake) with contrasting water chemistry. Our analysis highlights the role of polyamines in the nitrogen cycle, the diversity of diazotrophs between lake types, the balance of assimilatory vs. dissimilatory sulfate reduction in freshwater, the various associations between types of phototrophy and carbon fixation, and the density and diversity of glycoside hydrolases in freshwater microbes. We also investigated aspects of central metabolism such as hydrogen metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, methylotrophy, and sugar degradation. Finally, by analyzing the dynamics over time in nitrogen fixation genes and Cyanobacteria genomes, we show that the potential for nitrogen fixation is linked to specific populations in Lake Mendota. This work represents an important step towards incorporating microbial data into ecosystem models and provides a better understanding of how microbes may participate in freshwater biogeochemical cycling.

AB Permafrost dynamics play an important role in high-latitude peatland carbon balance and are key to understanding the future response of soil carbon stocks. Permafrost aggradation can control the magnitude of the carbon feedback in peatlands through effects on peat properties. We compiled peatland plant macrofossil records for the northern permafrost zone (515 cores from 280 sites) and classified samples by vegetation type and environmental class (fen, bog, tundra and boreal permafrost, and thawed permafrost). We examined differences in peat properties (bulk density, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and organic matter content, and C/N ratio) and C accumulation rates among vegetation types and environmental classes. Consequences of permafrost aggradation differed between boreal and tundra biomes, including differences in vegetation composition, C/N ratios, and N content. The vegetation composition of tundra permafrost peatlands was similar to permafrost-free fens, while boreal permafrost peatlands more closely resembled permafrost-free bogs. Nitrogen content in boreal permafrost and thawed permafrost peatlands was significantly lower than in permafrost-free bogs despite similar vegetation types (0.9% versus 1.5% N). Median long-term C accumulation rates were higher in fens (23g C m(-2)yr(-1)) than in permafrost-free bogs (18g C m(-2)yr(-1)) and were lowest in boreal permafrost peatlands (14g C m(-2)yr(-1)). The plant macrofossil record demonstrated transitions from fens to bogs to permafrost peatlands, bogs to fens, permafrost aggradation within fens, and permafrost thaw and reaggradation. Using data synthesis, we have identified predominant peatland successional pathways, changes in vegetation type, peat properties, and C accumulation rates associated with permafrost aggradation.

AB Northern peatlands are likely to be important in future carbon cycle-climate feedbacks due to their large carbon pools and vulnerability to hydrological change. Use of non-peatland-specific models could lead to bias in modeling studies of peatland-rich regions. Here, seven ecosystem models were used to simulate CO2 fluxes at three wetland sites in Canada and the northern United States, including two nutrient-rich fens and one nutrient-poor, sphagnum-dominated bog, over periods between 1999 and 2007. Models consistently overestimated mean annual gross ecosystem production (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) at all three sites. Monthly flux residuals (simulated - observed) were correlated with measured water table for GEP and ER at the two fen sites, but were not consistently correlated with water table at the bog site. Models that inhibited soil respiration under saturated conditions had less mean bias than models that did not. Modeled diurnal cycles agreed well with eddy covariance measurements at fen sites, but overestimated fluxes at the bog site. Eddy covariance GEP and ER at fens were higher during dry periods than during wet periods, while models predicted either the opposite relationship or no significant difference. At the bog site, eddy covariance GEP did not depend on water table, while simulated GEP was higher during wet periods. Carbon cycle modeling in peatland-rich regions could be improved by incorporating wetland-specific hydrology and by inhibiting GEP and ER under saturated conditions. Bogs and fens likely require distinct plant and soil parameterizations in ecosystem models due to differences in nutrients, peat properties, and plant communities.

AB Grasslands are one of the major biomes on earth and can serve as important soil carbon sinks. Nutrient enrichment of these grasslands can have a significant impact on carbon losses through the decomposition process. We investigated the effects of long-term (12-yr) experimentally increased N and/or P supply on litter production and on the chemistry and decomposition of bulk litter from two grasslands differing in soil nutrient status.
   Potential aboveground litter production in the controls of a P-rich low-productivity riparian grassland was lower than that in a N-rich high-productivity peat grassland and increased with enhanced N supply. Nutrient treatments did not enhance litter production in the high-productivity peat grassland. The concentrations of phenolics in bulk litter from the peat grassland, dominated by sedges, were 2-3 times higher than those in the riparian grassland that was dominated by herbs and grasses. At both sites increased nutrient supply had no detectable effect on phenolics concentrations. All P-related litter chemistry parameters reflected the higher soil P status of the riparian grassland. P fertilization had a greater effect on litter chemistry in the P-deficient peat grassland than in the P-rich riparian grassland. At both sites, there was no change in overall litter chemistry in response to N fertilization, except for higher lignin concentrations in the peat grassland litter. Both short-term (8 wk) litter incubations in the laboratory and a 3-yr litter bag study in the field showed that riparian grassland litter decomposed faster than litter from the peat grassland. The long-term nutrient additions had no significant effects on the decomposition of the bulk litter of each grassland type. Regression analysis on the combined data of the two sites showed that phenolics, and to a lesser extent, P-related litter chemistry parameters, exerted a strong control on both litter respiration and litter mass loss.
   Our study shows that long-term experimental nutrient additions do not lead to increased decomposition rates in grasslands and that the initial plant community litter quality is the main determinant of carbon losses through the decomposition process. The results of this study suggest that nutrient enrichment will likely affect ecosystem carbon balance more by affecting litter production than by affecting litter decomposition rates.

TI MYCORRHIZAE ALTER QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF CARBON ALLOCATED BELOW GROUND
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL; SEEDLINGS; HYPHAE; ROOTS; FLOW; CO2
AB PLANTS and sails are a critically important element in the global carbon-energy equation. It is estimated that in forest ecosystems over two-thirds of the carbon is contained in soils and peat deposits(1). Despite the importance of forest soils in the global carbon cycle, fluxes of carbon associated with fundamental processes and soil functional groups are inadequately quantified, limiting our understanding of carbon movement and sequestration in soils. We report here the direct measurement of carbon id and through all major pools of a mycorrhizal (fungus-root) coniferous seedling (a complete carbon budget). The mycorrhizal symbiont reduces overall retention of carbon in the plant-fungus symbiosis by increasing carbon in roots and below-ground respiration and reducing its retention and release above ground. Below ground, mycorrhizal plants shifted allocation of carbon to pools that are rapidly turned over, primarily to fine roots and fungal hyphae, and host root and fungal respiration. Mycorrhizae alter the size of below-ground carbon pools, the quality and, therefore, the retention time of carbon below ground. Our data indicate that if elevated atmospheric CO2 and altered climate stressors alter mycorrhizal colonization in forests, the role of forests in sequestering carbon could be altered.

AB An integrated understanding of the biogeochemical consequences of climate extremes and land use changes is needed to constrain land-surface feedbacks to atmospheric CO2 from associated climate change. Past assessments of the global carbon balance have shown particularly high uncertainty in Southeast Asia. Here, we use a combination of model ensembles to show that intensified land use change made Southeast Asia a strong source of CO2 from the 1980s to 1990s, whereas the region was close to carbon neutral in the 2000s due to an enhanced CO2 fertilization effect and absence of moderate-to-strong El Nino events. Our findings suggest that despite ongoing deforestation, CO2 emissions were substantially decreased during the 2000s, largely owing to milder climate that restores photosynthetic capacity and suppresses peat and deforestation fire emissions. The occurrence of strong El Nino events after 2009 suggests that the region has returned to conditions of increased vulnerability of carbon stocks.

AB Peatlands are a dominant landform in the northern hemisphere, accumulating carbon in the form of peat due to an imbalance between decomposition and plant production rates. Decomposer (saprobes) and mycorrhizal fungi significantly influence carbon dynamics by degrading organic matter via the synthesis of extracellular enzymes. As organic matter decomposes, litter quality variables figure most prominently in the succession of fungi. Hence, litters composed primarily of complex polymers decompose very slowly. Surprisingly, recalcitrant polymer degraders (mostly basidiomycetes) are rarely isolated from peat, which may explain the accumulation of complex polymers in peat profiles. While enzymatic profiles of mycorrhizal fungi and other root endophytes may be more limited compared with saprobes, many of these fungi can degrade polymers of varying complexity as well and hence may also be significant decomposers of organic matter. To date, anamorphic ascomycetes and zygomycetes are the most frequently isolated fungi from peatlands (63 and 10% of all taxa, respectively), and chytridiomycetes, teleomorphic ascomycetes, and basidiomycetes appear to be less common (11% of all taxa). The remaining 16% of taxa remain unidentified or are sterile taxa. How disturbances affect peatland microbial communities and their roles is virtually unknown. This aspect of peatland microbial ecology requires immediate attention. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge of the diversity of fungi and their roles in carbon cycling dynamics in peatlands.

AB Freshwater peatlands represent an important component of global biogeochemistry through their role in carbon sequestration. Threats to carbon storage in freshwater peat include climate-related increases in rates of oxidation and methanogenesis, increased wildfires, drainage, and dissolved organic carbon export from runoff. This paper discusses the potential impact of sea level rise on carbon fluxes from coastal peatlands, an issue not addressed by previous studies describing threats to peatlands from global climate change. We estimate carbon stocks and potential emissions from a coastal freshwater peatland located in North Carolina, United States. Four scenarios for inundation were modeled using Hadley-CM3 scenarios (including the effects of collapsed barrier islands) with a lidar-derived digital elevation model. Monte Carlo analysis was used to address model uncertainty and sensitivity of carbon emission parameters for three scenarios. Total existing carbon storage (peat and vegetation) on the Peninsula (5671 km 2) was estimated to range between 155.5 and 201.0 TgC (95% confidence intervals). Sea level projections ranged from 0.35 to 1.38 m by the end of the century and were estimated to inundate between 1260 and 3020 km 2 of the Peninsula. Carbon emissions from inundation of peat and vegetation ranged from 4.7-20.9 TgC (assuming inundation preserved peat deposits) to 99.4-128.0 TgC (assuming 100% emissions of inundated peat). While considerable uncertainty exists regarding the fate of carbon fluxes, we identify 150,000 km 2 of freshwater peatlands worldwide below 5-m elevation and vulnerable to sea level rise. Our study suggests that future sea level rise may contribute a positive feedback to the global carbon cycle.

AB Global warming is likely to influence the soil microorganisms and enzyme activity and alter the carbon and nitrogen balance of peatland ecosystems. To investigate the difference in sensitivities of carbon and nitrogen cycling microorganisms and enzyme activity to warming, we conducted three-year warming experiments in a boreal peatland. Our findings demonstrated that both mcrA and nirS gene abundance in shallow soil and deep soil exhibited insensitivity to warming, while shallow soil archaea 16S rRNA gene and amoA gene abundance in both shallow soil and deep soil increased under warming. Soil pmoA gene abundance of both layers, bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance in shallow soil, and nirK gene abundance in deep soil decreased due to warming. The decreases of these gene abundances would be a result of losing labile substrates because of the competitive interactions between aboveground plants and underground soil microorganisms. Experimental warming inhibited -glucosidase activity in two soil layers and invertase activity in deep soil, while it stimulated acid phosphatase activity in shallow soil. Both temperature and labile substrates regulate the responses of soil microbial abundances and enzyme activities to warming and affect the coupling relationships of carbon and nitrogen. This study provides a potential microbial mechanism controlling carbon and nitrogen cycling in peatland under climate warming.

AB Plant litter (including standing litter) modification plays a vital role in wetland carbon (C) balance, which can be greatly altered by global change. Our knowledge of the fundamental function of plant litter in ecosystem respiration (Re) is crucial for evaluating C exchange between the atmosphere and biosphere. However, it is not well understood how litter manipulation could influence the dynamics of Re and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) in wetland ecosystems. In the present study, we conducted a field manipulation experiment with the following treatments of total aboveground plant litter removal (ALR), standing litter exclusion (AR), doubled plant litter (DL) and unchanged litter input (CK) to study the effects of wetland plant litter on Re and Q(10) values over two growing seasons (2015 and 2016) in a Deyeuxia angustifolia-dominated freshwater marsh in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. Results showed that wetland Re was significantly affected by different plant litter input manipulations. During the two growing seasons, the Re ranged from 27.16 to 643.61 (ALR), 39.61-690.25 (AR), 136.27-1270.38 (DL) and 72.11-862.42 mg CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) (CK), which decreased by 28.36-68.04% and 15.11-63.23% of the ALR and AR treatments and increased by 15.41-20.59% of the DL treatment compared with CK, respectively. The changes in Re was more susceptible to litter removal effects. In 2016, the mean Re values of ALR and AR treatments decreased significantly compared with the corresponding values in 2015, while it was significantly increased in the DL treatment. The concentrations of NH4+ and DOC, as microbes directly used carbon and nitrogen sources in soil pore water were significantly affected by litter input manipulations suggesting that there are various carbon and nitrogen sources within and outside the plant litter. The Q(10) values of Re under each litter input manipulation treatment differed markedly, and the highest value (3.32-4.06) occurred in the total plant-derived litter input removal treatments indicating that the wetland soil was vulnerable to disturbance that prone to carbon losses in the context of global warming. Our results also demonstrated that the Q(10) values of the deeper soil (below 15 cm) with vegetation present were lower than that for the other litter removal treatments implying the important function of the carbon sink in this wetland ecosystem. Overall, we recommend that the role of wetland plant litter input to the soil system should be seriously considered when predicting biosphere-atmosphere C exchange model under the background of global climate change.

AB The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GDS) is a large temperate swamp in Virginia/North Carolina, USA with peat soils historically resistant to microbial decomposition. However, this peatland has been subject to similar to 200 years of disturbance during which extensive drainage, fire suppression, and widespread logging have increased decomposition and dramatically decreased the distribution of Atlantic white cedar (AWC). The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of long-term drainage and AWC loss on the carbon chemistry of GDS peats. Peat cores were collected from three drained GDS vegetation communities (pocosin, AWC, and red maple-black gum) and compared to cores collected from an intact, undrained AWC peatland at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (AR) in North Carolina. The AR peats had higher lignin content in the deeper peat intervals, and lignin content and percent organic carbon were largely invariant with depth compared to the GDS peats. The concentrations of syringyl group phenols were greater in the surface layers of GDS peats, likely reflecting the selective removal of AWC and transition from gymnosperms to angiosperms. Acid to aldehyde ratios for vanillyl and syringyl group phenols indicated that the GDS peats were more decomposed, particularly at depth, and that this occurred under aerobic conditions. Moreover, solid-state C-13 NMR confirmed a coincident loss of carbohydrates and increase in recalcitrant by-products of carbohydrate degradation with depth. These data indicate that long-term drainage has accelerated the decomposition of peat at the GDS, reducing the capacity and stability of the carbon sink.

AB This paper describes the operational methods to achieve and measure both deep-soil heating (0-3 m) and whole-ecosystem warming (WEW) appropriate to the scale of tall-stature, high-carbon, boreal forest peatlands. The methods were developed to allow scientists to provide a plausible set of ecosystem-warming scenarios within which immediate and longer-term (1 decade) responses of organisms (microbes to trees) and ecosystem functions (carbon, water and nutrient cycles) could be measured. Elevated CO2 was also incorporated to test how temperature responses may be modified by atmospheric CO2 effects on carbon cycle processes. The WEW approach was successful in sustaining a wide range of aboveground and belowground temperature treatments (+0, +2.25, +4.5, +6.75 and +9 degrees C) in large 115m(2) open-topped enclosures with elevated CO2 treatments (+0 to +500 ppm). Air warming across the entire 10 enclosure study required similar to 90% of the total energy for WEW ranging from 64 283 mega Joules (MJ) d(-1) during the warm season to 80 102 MJ d(-1) during cold months. Soil warming across the study required only 1.3 to 1.9% of the energy used ranging from 954 to 1782 MJ d(-1) of energy in the warm and cold seasons, respectively. The residual energy was consumed by measurement and communication systems. Sustained temperature and elevated CO2 treatments were only constrained by occasional high external winds. This paper contrasts the in situ WEW method with closely related field-warming approaches using both aboveground (air or infrared heating) and belowground-warming methods. It also includes a full discussion of confounding factors that need to be considered carefully in the interpretation of experimental results. The WEW method combining aboveground and deep-soil heating approaches enables observations of future temperature conditions not available in the current observational record, and therefore provides a plausible glimpse of future environmental conditions.

AB Climatological measurements, including carbon dioxide flux density, were made from April to September in 1994 and from April to November in 1996 at a fen wetland near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada, as part df the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). For both years, the study period was warmer and drier than the 24-year climate normals. The period of CO2 uptake was similar for both years, reaching maximum measured assimilation rates of -0.55 mg m(-2) s(-1) in midsummer. However, warmer air temperatures and an earlier snowmelt in the spring of 1994, which led to an earlier thaw for the fen surface, and warmer and drier conditions in the fall of 1994 promoted CO2 production at times when the vascular vegetation was not photosynthesizing. As a result, in 1994 over the study period of 124 days the fen was a net source of CO2-carbon to the atmosphere, losing 30.8 g C m(-2); for the same period in 1996 the fen was a net sink of CO2-carbon, assimilating -91.6 g C m(-2). Given the immense store of carbon in boreal peatlands and given a growing understanding of the relative importance of the soil carbon pool to net ecosystem exchange and of the sensitivity of this carbon storage to temperature and wetness, this boreal fen's response to earlier spring warming and drier conditions extends our understanding of the impact of climate change on the carbon balance for northern ecosystems.

AB Peatlands and permafrost are important components of the carbon cycle in the northern high latitudes. The inclusion of these components into a dynamic global vegetation model required changes to physical land surface routines, the addition of two new peatland-specific plant functional types, incorporation of an inundation stress mechanism, and deceleration of decomposition under inundation. The new model, LPJ-WHy v1.2, was used to simulate net ecosystem production (NEP), net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (HR), and soil carbon content. Annual peatland NEP matches observations even though the seasonal amplitude is overestimated. This overestimation is caused by excessive NPP values, probably due to the lack of nitrogen or phosphorus limitation in LPJ-WHy. Introduction of permafrost reduces circumpolar (45-90 degrees N) NEP from 1.65 to 0.96 Pg C a(-1) and leads to an increase in soil carbon content of almost 40 Pg C; adding peatlands doubles this soil carbon increase. Peatland soil carbon content and hence HR depend on model spin-up duration and are crucial for simulating NEP. These results highlight the need for a regional peatland age map to help determine spin-up times. A sensitivity experiment revealed that under future climate conditions, NPP may rise more rapidly than HR resulting in increases in NEP.

AB Methanol is an abundant atmospheric volatile organic compound that is released from both living and decaying plant material. In forest and other aerated soils, methanol can be consumed by methanol-utilizing microorganisms that constitute a known terrestrial sink. However, the environmental factors that drive the biodiversity of such methanol-utilizers have been hardly resolved. Soil-derived isolates of methanolutilizers can also often assimilate multicarbon compounds as alternative substrates. Here, we conducted a comparative DNA stable isotope probing experiment under methylotrophic (only [C-13(1)]-methanol was supplemented) and combined substrate conditions ([C-12(1)]-methanol and alternative multi-carbon [C-13(u)]-substrates were simultaneously supplemented) to (i) identify methanol-utilizing microorganisms of a deciduous forest soil (European beech dominated temperate forest in Germany), (ii) assess their substrate range in the soil environment, and (iii) evaluate their trophic links to other soil microorganisms. The applied multi-carbon substrates represented typical intermediates of organic matter degradation, such as acetate, plant-derived sugars (xylose and glucose), and a lignin-derived aromatic compound (vanillic acid). An experimentally induced pH shift was associated with substantial changes of the diversity of active methanol-utilizers suggesting that soil pH was a niche-defining factor of these microorganisms. The main bacterial methanol-utilizers were members of the Beijerinckiaceae (Bacteria) that played a central role in a detected methanol-based food web. A clear preference for methanol or multi-carbon substrates as carbon source of different Beijerinckiaceae-affiliated phylotypes was observed suggesting a restricted substrate range of the methylotrophic representatives. Apart from Bacteria, we also identified the yeasts Cryptococcus and Trichosporon as methanol-derived carbon-utilizing fungi suggesting that further research is needed to exclude or prove methylotrophy of these fungi.

AB Based on review and original data, this synthesis investigates carbon pools and fluxes of Siberian and European forests (600 and 300 million ha, respectively). We examine the productivity of ecosystems, expressed as positive rate when the amount of carbon in the ecosystem increases, while (following micrometeorological convention) downward fluxes from the atmosphere to the vegetation (NEE=Net Ecosystem Exchange) are expressed as negative numbers. Productivity parameters are Net Primary Productivity (NPP=whole plant growth), Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP = CO2 assimilation minus ecosystem respiration), and Net Biome Productivity (NBP=NEP minus carbon losses through disturbances bypassing respiration, e.g. by fire and logging). Based on chronosequence studies and national forestry statistics we estimate a low average NPP for boreal forests in Siberia: 123 gC m(-2) y(-1). This contrasts with a similar calculation for Europe which suggests a much higher average NPP of 460 gC m(-2) y(-1) for the forests there. Despite a smaller area, European forests have a higher total NPP than Siberia (1.2-1.6 vs. 0.6-0.9 x 10(15) gC region(-1) y(-1)). This arises as a consequence of differences in growing season length, climate and nutrition.
   For a chronosequence of Pinus sylvestris stands studied in central Siberia during summer, NEE was most negative in a 67-y old stand regenerating after fire (-192 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) which is close to NEE in a cultivated forest of Germany (-210 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Considerable net ecosystem CO2-uptake was also measured in Siberia in 200- and 215-y old stands (NEE:174 and - 63 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) while NEP of 7- and 13-y old logging areas were close to the ecosystem compensation point. Two Siberian bogs and a bog in European Russia were also significant carbon sinks (-102 to - 104 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Integrated over a growing season (June to September) we measured a total growing season NEE of -14 mol m(-2) summer(-1) (-168 gC m(-2) summer(-1)) in a 200-y Siberian pine stand and -5 mol m(-2) summer(-1) (-60 gC m(-2) summer(-1)) in Siberian and European Russian bogs. By contrast, over the same period, a spruce forest in European Russia was a carbon source to the atmosphere of (NEE: + 7 mol m(-2) summer(-1) = + 84 gC m(-2) summer(-1)). Two years after a windthrow in European Russia, with all trees being uplifted and few successional species, lost 16 mol C m(-2) to the atmosphere over a 3-month in summer, compared to the cumulative NEE over a growing season in a German forest of -15.5 mol m(-2) summer(-1) (-186 gC m(-2) summer(-1); European flux network annual averaged - 205 gC m(-2) y(-1)).
   Differences in CO2-exchange rates coincided with differences in the Bowen ratio, with logging areas partitioning most incoming radiation into sensible heat whereas bogs partitioned most into evaporation (latent heat). Effects of these different surface energy exchanges on local climate (convective storms and fires) and comparisons with the Canadian BOREAS experiment are discussed.
   Following a classification of disturbances and their effects on ecosystem carbon balances, fire and logging are discussed as the main processes causing carbon losses that bypass heterotrophic respiration in Siberia. Following two approaches, NBP was estimated to be only about 13-16 mmol m(-2) y(-1) for Siberia. It may reach 67 mmol m(-2) y(-1) in North America, and about 140-400 mmol m(-2) y(-1) in Scandinavia.
   We conclude that fire speeds up the carbon cycle, but that it results also in long-term carbon sequestration by charcoal formation. For at least 14 years after logging, regrowth forests remain net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. This has important implications regarding the effects of Siberian forest management on atmospheric concentrations. For many years after logging has taken place, regrowth forests remain weaker sinks for atmospheric CO2 than are nearby old-growth forests.

AB Large amounts of carbon are stored in northern peatlands. There is concern that greater wildfire severity following projected increases in summer drought will lead to higher post-fire carbon losses. We measured soil carbon dynamics in a Calluna heathland and a raised peat bog after experimentally manipulating fire severity. A gradient of fire severity was achieved by simulating drought in 2 x 2 m plots. Ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), methane (CH4) flux and concentration of dissolved organic carbon ( [DOC], measured at the raised bog only) were measured for up to two years after burning. The response of these carbon fluxes to increased fire severity in drought plots was similar to plots burnt under ambient conditions associated with traditional managed burning. Averaged across all burnt plots, burning altered mean NEE from a net carbon sink at the heathland ( - 0.33 mu mol CO2 m(-2) S-1 in unburnt plots) to a carbon source (0.50 mu mol m(-2) S-1 in burnt plots) and at the raised bog ( - 0.38 and 0.16 mu mol m(-2) S-1, respectively). Burning also increased CH4 flux at the raised bog (from 1.16 to 25.3 nmol m(-2) S-1 in the summer, when it accounted for 79% of the CO2-equivalent emission). Burning had no significant effect on soil water [DOC].

AB Land use change and land management practices affect the net emissions of the trace gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon sources and sinks. Changes in CH4 and N2O emissions can substantially alter the overall greenhouse gas balance of a system. Drainage of peatlands for agriculture or forestry generally increases N2O emission as well as that of CO2, but also decreases CH4 emission. Intermittent drainage. or late flooding of rice paddies can greatly diminish the seasonal emission of CH4 compared with continuous flooding. Changes in N2O emissions following land use change from forest or grassland to agriculture vary between climatic zones, and the net impact varies with time. In many soils, the increase in carbon sequestration by adopting no-till systems may be largely negated by associated increases in N2O emission. The promotion of carbon credits for the no-till system before we have better quantification of its net greenhouse gas balance is naive. Applying nitrogen fertilizers to forests could increase the forest carbon sink, but may be accompanied by a net increase in N2O; conversely, adding lime to acid forest soils can decrease the N2O emission.

AB Carbon dioxide exchange was measured, using the eddy covariance technique, during a one and a half year period in 1994 and 1995. The measurements took place over a former true raised bog, characterized by a shallow peat layer and a vegetation dominated by Molinia caerulea. The growing season extended from May until late October, with a maximum LAI in August of 1.7.
   The carbon balance shows a net release of 97 g C m(-2) y(-1) (265 kg C ha(-1) y(-1)) from the peat bog ecosystem to the atmosphere. During June, July and August there is net consumption of CO2, while during the rest of the year there is net production of CO2. The average daytime assimilation rates ranged between - 0.2 and - 0.5 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (- 45 and -11.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), in a period where the LAI ranged between 1 and 1.7. A high vapour pressure deficit (> 15 hPa) corresponding with high temperatures was found to reduce the assimilation rate by on average 50%. Apart from these factors, LAI and the soil temperature codetermine the net exchange of CO2.
   The total nocturnal respiration during the growing season lies within the same order as the average daytime net assimilation rate. Temperature was found to be the main fatter controlling soil respiration, with a Q(10) of 4.8.

AB On a global scale, the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) from peatland drainage and cultivation are believed to account for similar to 5% of estimated anthropogenic GHG emissions. Drainage generally leads to peat subsidence and extensive soil loss, resulting in a diminishing store of soil carbon (C). This is a challenge for maintaining drainage -based agriculture, as such practices will eventually lead to the loss of organic soils that arable cultivation depends on. The conversion of croplands on peat to semi-natural grasslands, alongside raising water tables, is one possible way to reduce the loss of these valuable C stores. Here, we report the net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) of two lowland peatlands in East Anglia, south-east UK. One site is a relic conservation-managed fen on deep peat, subject to active hydrological management to maintain water levels, and dominated by Cladium and Phragmites sedge and reed beds, whilst the other is a former cropland that has been converted to seasonally inundated grazed grassland. Despite occasionally experiencing severe water table drawdown, the conservation managed fen was a strong C sink of-104 g C m(-2) yr(-1). In contrast, the grassland was a C source of 133 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions being the main loss pathway, due to low water tables exposing the soil profile in summer. At each site, ditch emissions of CO2 were moderately large (22 and 37 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), whilst ditch methane (CH4) emissions (0.2 and 1.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) made a negligible contribution to the NECB, but are important when considering the ecosystem GHG balance in terms of CO2 equivalents. Excluding dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), fluvial C losses were 6 g C M-2 yr(-1) for the conservation-managed fen and 12 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the former cropland, and were dominated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The small fluvial C loss is the result of both sites being hydrologically isolated from the surrounding agricultural landscapes. Although the partially re-wetted cropland was still acting as a net C source, our estimates suggest that seasonal rewetting has reduced net annual C losses to similar to 20% of their former cropland values. Maintaining high water tables year round would potentially further reduce C losses, and shallow inundation might allow the return of wetland species such as Phragmites and Typha, perhaps as floating rafts.

AB Herbivory is an important part of most ecosystems, and grazing alone can have a considerable impact on the ecosystems carbon balance with both direct and indirect effects. Removal of above-ground biomass by consumption of herbivores will change the below-ground carbon stock; the reduction of litter that goes into the ground will influence the total ecosystem carbon content. Little is however known about how plant-herbivory interactions effect the carbon balance, in particular methane emissions, of high arctic mires. We hypothesized that increased grazing pressure will change carbon allocation patterns resulting in decreased net ecosystem uptake of carbon and subsequently in lower methane emissions. An in-situ field experiment was conducted over 3 years in a high arctic mire at Zackenberg in NE Greenland. The experiment consisted of three treatments, with five replicates of each (1) control, (2) vascular plants were removed (NV), (3) clipped twice each growing season in order to simulate increased muskox grazing. Immediately after the initiation of the experiment net ecosystem uptake of CO2 decreased in clipped plots (mean total decrease for the three following years was 35 %). One year into the experiment a significantly lower CH4 emission was observed in these plots, the total mean reduction for the following 2 years was 26 %. Three years into the experiment significantly lower substrate (acetic acid) availability for CH4 production was observed (27 % reduction). NV plots had a mean decrease in CO2 uptake of 113 %, a 62 % decrease in ecosystem respiration and an 84 % decrease in CH4 emission (mean of all 3 years). Our study shows that increased grazing pressure in a high arctic mire can lead to significant changes in the carbon balance, with lower CO2 uptake leading to lower production of substrate for CH4 formation and in lower CH4 emission.

AB Research on the ionic chemistry of rivers and weathering types provides the basis for elucidating the dynamics of river chemistry and exploring carbon cycling in river systems. There is a lack of water chemistry study in the river systems in the Tibet Plateau, especially in the streams/rivers flowing from and through glaciers and permafrost. Samples in the rivers flowing through different land covers (lakes, glaciers, permafrost, grasslands, peatlands) were collected in different months (April, June, August and October) in 2016, covering various hydrological regimes. The temporal and spatial dynamic variations of major ions and the underlying causes were explored. The results revealed that in the headwater region Ca2+ and HCO3- were the dominant ions, derived primarily from the dissolution of carbonatites and evaporates. However, the concentrations of ions from different land covers were vastly different.The high concentrations of Na+ and K+ in the lakes sample were mainly affected by evaporation and precipitation. The acid deposition caused by atmospheric pollutants resulted in high concentration of SO42- in glacial and permafrost streams. K+ concentration was high in the grassland region with frequent agricultural activities such as the planting and fertilization of highland barleys that applied nitrogen and potassium fertilizers. Although Total Dissolved Load (TDS) was higher for the lakes and streams/rivers from glaciers and permafrost, and its average (287.28 +/- 40 mg/L) over the headwater region was lower than that in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River because of low temperature. The current study provided the basis of and reference for the overall water chemistry characteristics and carbon cycling processes of the entire Yellow River.

AB Northern Hemisphere-wide cooling during the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1650-1775 Common Era, C.E.) was associated with a similar to 5ppmv decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Changes in terrestrial and ocean carbon reservoirs have been postulated as possible drivers of this relatively large shift in atmospheric CO2, potentially providing insights into the mechanisms and sensitivity of the global carbon cycle. Here we report decadally resolved radiocarbon (C-14) levels in a network of tree-ring series spanning 1700-1950 C.E. located along the northern boundary of, and within, the Southern Ocean. We observe regional dilutions in atmospheric radiocarbon (relative to the Northern Hemisphere) associated with upwelling of (CO2)-C-14-depleted abyssal waters. We find the interhemispheric C-14 offset approaches zero during increasing global atmospheric CO2 at the end of the LIA, with reduced ventilation in the Southern Ocean and a Northern Hemisphere source of old carbon (most probably originating from deep Arctic peat layers). The coincidence of the atmospheric CO2 increase and reduction in the interhemispheric C-14 offset imply a common climate control. Possible mechanisms of synchronous change in the high latitudes of both hemispheres are discussed.

AB The complete genomes of three strains from the phylum Acidobacteria were compared. Phylogenetic analysis placed them as a unique phylum. They share genomic traits with members of the Proteobacteria, the Cyanobacteria, and the Fungi. The three strains appear to be versatile heterotrophs. Genomic and culture traits indicate the use of carbon sources that span simple sugars to more complex substrates such as hemicellulose, cellulose, and chitin. The genomes encode low-specificity major facilitator superfamily transporters and high-affinity ABC transporters for sugars, suggesting that they are best suited to low-nutrient conditions. They appear capable of nitrate and nitrite reduction but not N-2 fixation or denitrification. The genomes contained numerous genes that encode siderophore receptors, but no evidence of siderophore production was found, suggesting that they may obtain iron via interaction with other microorganisms. The presence of cellulose synthesis genes and a large class of novel high-molecular-weight excreted proteins suggests potential traits for desiccation resistance, biofilm formation, and/or contribution to soil structure. Polyketide synthase and macrolide glycosylation genes suggest the production of novel antimicrobial compounds. Genes that encode a variety of novel proteins were also identified. The abundance of acidobacteria in soils worldwide and the breadth of potential carbon use by the sequenced strains suggest significant and previously unrecognized contributions to the terrestrial carbon cycle. Combining our genomic evidence with available culture traits, we postulate that cells of these isolates are long-lived, divide slowly, exhibit slow metabolic rates under low-nutrient conditions, and are well equipped to tolerate fluctuations in soil hydration.

AB Globally, lakes are currently accumulating organic carbon (OC) at an estimated annnal rate of about 42 Tg.yr(-1). Most of the OC in all but the most oligotrophic of these lakes is autochthonous, produced by primary production in the lakes. The sediments of reservoirs accumulate an additional 160 Tg annually, and peatlands contribute 96 Tg annually. These three carbon pools collectively cover less than 2% of the Earth's surface and constitute a carbon sink of about 300 Tg.yr(-1). Although the oceans cover 71% of the Earth's surface, they accumulate OC at a rate of only about 100 Tg.yr(-1).

AB Understanding the long-term ecological dynamics of northern peatlands is essential for assessment of the possible responses and feedbacks of these carbon-rich ecosystems to climate change and natural disturbance. I used high-resolution macrofossil and lithological analyses of a fen peatland in western Canada to infer the Holocene developmental history of the peatland, to document the temporal pattern of long-term peat accumulation, and to investigate ecosystems responses to climate changes in terms of species composition and carbon accumulation. The peatland has been dominated by sedges and brown mosses during its 10,000-year history, despite interruption by tephra deposition. Peat accumulation rates vary by more than an order of magnitude and decline from 5500 to 1300 cal BP, resulting in a convex depth-age curve, which contrasts with the carbon accumulation patterns documented for oceanic peatlands. The synthesis of regional data from continental western Canada indicates that fens tend to accumulate more carbon than bogs of the same ages. These data suggest that the carbon sink potential of northern peatlands has varied dramatically in the past, so estimates of the present and projected carbon sink strengths of these peatlands need to take this temporal variation into consideration. Widespread slowdown of peat accumulation over the last 4000 years may have resulted from climate cooling in northern latitudes after the Holocene insolation maximum. The findings indicate that long-term peatland dynamics are modified by many local and regional factors and that gradual environmental change may be capable of triggering abrupt shifts and jumps in ecosystem states.

AB Gross primary production (GPP) is a key driver of the peatland carbon cycle. Although many studies have explored the apparent GPP under natural light conditions, knowledge of the maximum GPP at lightsaturation (GPP(max)) and its spatio-temporal variation is limited. This information, however, is crucial since GPP(max) essentially constrains the upper boundary for apparent GPP. Using chamber measurements combined with an external light source across experimental plots where vegetation composition was altered through long-term (20-year) nitrogen addition and artificial warming, we could quantify GPP(max) in-situ and disentangle its biotic and abiotic controls in a boreal peatland. We found large spatial and temporal variations in the magnitudes of GPP(max) which were related to vegetation species composition and phenology rather than abiotic factors. Specifically, we identified vegetation phenology as the main driver of the seasonal GPP(max) trajectory. Abiotic anomalies (i.e. in air temperature and water table level), however, caused species-specific divergence between the trajectories of GPP(max) and plant development. Our study demonstrates that photosynthetically active biomass constrains the potential peatland photosynthesis while abiotic factors act as secondary modifiers. This further calls for a better representation of species-specific vegetation phenology in process-based peatland models to improve predictions of global change impacts on the peatland carbon cycle.

AB Methane emissions from wetlands are highly variable, both spatially and temporally and at scales ranging from microtopographic to regional differences. To comprehend this variation fully and also to predict responses to climate change, an understanding of the intimate linkage between carbon cycling and methane emission in these systems is needed. The presence of vascular plants has been recognized recently as one of the key factors controlling the scale of methane fluxes because it affects processes coupled to transport, production and consumption of methane. A wide area of research has therefore opened up, calling for investigations into details of the impact of vascular plants on methane emissions.

AB Microbial communities play key roles in remediation and reclamation of contaminated environments via biogeochemical cycling of organic and inorganic components. Understanding the trends in in situ microbial community abundance, metabolism and carbon sources is therefore a crucial component of effective site management. The focus of this study was to use radiocarbon analysis to elucidate the carbon sources driving microbial metabolism within the first pilot Wetland reclamation project in the Alberta oil sands region where the observation of H2S had indicated the occurrence of microbial sulphate reduction. The reclamation project involved construction of a three compartment system consisting of a freshwater wetland on top of a sand cap overlying a composite tailings (CT) deposit. Radiocarbon analysis demonstrated that both dissolved and sediment associated organic carbon associated with the deepest compartments (the CF and sand cap) was primarily fossil (Delta C-14 = -769 to -955 parts per thousand) while organic carbon in the overlying peat was hundreds to thousands of years old (Delta C-14 = -250 to -350 parts per thousand). Radiocarbon contents of sediment associated microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were consistent with the sediment bulk organic carbon pools (Peat: Delta C-14(PLFA) = 257 parts per thousand; Sand cap Delta C-14(PLFA) = -805 parts per thousand) indicating that these microbes were using sediment associated carbon. In contrast, microbial PLFA grown on biofilm units installed in wells within the deepest compartments contained much more modern carbon that the associated bulk carbon pools. This implied that the transfer of relatively more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth within the system. Correlation between cellular abundance estimates based on PLFA concentrations and the Delta C-14(PLFA) indicated that the utilization of this more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth. These results highlight the importance of understanding the occurrence and potential outcomes of the introduction of relatively bioavailable carbon to mine wastes in order to predict and manage the performance of reclamation strategies.

AB Iron (Fe) is among the limiting nutrients in marine environments and mainly originates from terrigenous sources. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), an important natural organic ligand, plays a key role in the dissolution and transport of terrestrial iron. Peat-derived DOC contains a large number of phenolics, and a systematic study of the geochemical interaction between DOC and Fe will contribute to the understanding of the global carbon and iron cycles. Phenolics, including phenolic acids, are secondary metabolites from plants and fungi. These compounds possess an aromatic ring bearing one or more hydroxyl groups and their structures may range from that of a simple phenolic molecule to that of a complex high-molecular weight polymer. Despite the extensive literature describing the biological effects of phenolic acids, the effect of phenolics on the iron cycle in peatlands is not known very well. Zoige peatland, the world's largest plateau peat wetland, was studied through field investigation and laboratory simulated experiments. The content of phenolics, filterable Fe and some physicochemical parameters in the rivers of the area were investigated. The waters are generally alkaline, with an average pH of 8.04, and aqueous Fe(III) and Fe(II) concentrations are higher than most of the common rivers in the world. The results of our experiments suggested that the high iron solubility was closely related to the phenolic content of the DOC. In particular, phenolics with catechol or galloy moieties forming complexes with iron and significantly impede the oxidation of complexed Fe(II). In addition, some phenolic substances are able to reduce ferric iron to ferrous iron. The combination of complexation and reduction in Fe by phenolics effectively increased the proportion of ferrous iron to total iron and slowed the oxidation and precipitation in the waters, maintaining a high content of "soluble iron" in the peatland. This mechanism has great implications for the effective transport of soluble iron from peatlands to aquatic ecosystems and the global coupled iron and carbon cycles.

AB Hummock-hollow microtopography is a unique feature of wetland ecosystems, but our understanding of its effects on soil carbon and nutrient cycling is limited. We investigated effects of microtopography on hydrology, phenol oxidase activity (POX) and nutrient availability in a freshwater forested wetland of coastal North Carolina. Water table depth (WTD) was measured from September 2012 to August 2013. Ion exchange probes were used to measure nutrient concentrations prior to soil sample collection in August 2013. WTD fluctuated seasonally with maximum and minimum WTD resulting in 92% (September 2012) to 8% (June 2013) of the site in flooded and non-flooded conditions, respectively. Hummocks had greater POX activity (12 +/- 2.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) compared to hollows (4 +/- 0.7 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and greater concentrations of potassium and sulfur, but lower concentrations of calcium, iron, zinc, boron, and lead. POX was negatively correlated with soil water content. Higher enzyme activity in hummocks likely drives greater rates of carbon and nutrient cycling compared to hollows, consistent with observations that hummocks are hotspots for CO2 fluxes.

AB Northern peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores, and they show large spatial and temporal variation in the atmospheric exchange of CO2 and CH4. Thus, annual carbon balance must be studied in detail in order to predict the climatic responses of these ecosystems. Closed-chamber methods were used to study CO2 and CH4 in hollow, Sphagnum angustifolium lawn, S. fuscum lawn, and hummock microsites within an ombrotrophic S, fuscum bog. Micrometeorological tower measurements were used as a reference for the CH4 efflux from the bog. Low precipitation during May-August in 1994 (84 mm below the long-term average for the same period) and a warm July-August period caused the water table to drop by more than 15 cm below the peat surface in the hollows and to 48 cm below the surface in high hummocks. Increased annual total respiration exceeded gross production and resulted in a net C loss of 4-157 g/m(2) in the different microsites. Drought probably caused irreversible desiccation in some lawns of S. angustifolium and S. balticum and in S. fuscum in the hummocks, while S. balticum growing in hollows retained its moisture and even increased its photosynthetic capacity during the July-August period. Seasonal (12 May-4 October) CH4 emissions ranged from 2 g CH4-C/m(2) in drier S. fuscum hummocks and lawns to 7 and 14 g/m(2) in wetter S. angustifolium-S. balticum lawns and hollows, respectively. Aerodynamic gradient measurements at the tower showed slightly higher CH4 flux rates than the average estimates for the whole bog obtained by closed-chamber methods. Winter C efflux comprised 30 g CO2-C/m(2) and 1 g CH4-C/m(2) out of a total loss of 90 g C/m(2) on average in the bog, and there was an estimated annual loss of 7 g C/m2 by leaching. This study shows how delicately the boreal bog's C balance in different microsites depends on climatic variations, especially the distribution of precipitation. It also confirms that severe C losses can occur in boreal bogs during extended summer droughts, even in years with annual temperatures close to the long-term average and with precipitation clearly greater than the long-term average.

AB Peatlands typically act as carbon sinks, however, increasing wildfire severity and annual area burned may challenge this carbon sink status. Whilst most peat resistance to wildfire and drought research is based on deep peatlands that rarely lose their water table below the peat profile, shallow peatlands and peat deposits may be most vulnerable to high peat burn severity and extensive carbon loss. To examine the role of pre-fire peat depth on peat burn severity, we measured the depth of burn (DOB) in peat of varying depths (0.1-1.6 m) within a rock barrens landscape. We found that DOB (0-0.4 m) decreased with increasing pre-fire peat depth, and that there was a strong correlation between the percent of the profile that burned and pre-fire peat depth. Breakpoint analysis indicates a threshold depth of 0.66 m where deeper peat deposits experienced little impact of wildfire, whereas shallower peat typically experienced high peat burn severity (median percent burned = 2.2 and 65.1, respectively). This threshold also corresponded to the loss of the water table in some nearby unburned peatlands, where water table drawdown rates were greater in shallower peat. We suggest that peat depth may control peat burn severity through feedbacks that regulate water table drawdown. As such, we argue that the identification of a critical peat depth threshold could have important implications for wildfire management and peatland restoration aiming to protect vulnerable carbon stores.

AB Although recent studies have recognized peatlands as a sink for atmospheric CO2, little is known about the role of Siberian peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We have estimated the Holocene peat and carbon accumulation rate in the peatlands of the southern taiga and subtaiga zones of western Siberia. We explain the accumulation rates by calculating the average peat accumulation rate and the long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) and by using the model of Clymo (1984, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B 303, 605-654). At three key areas in the southern taiga and subtaiga zones we studied eight sites, at which the dry bulk density, ash content, and carbon content were measured every 10 cm. Age was established by radiocarbon dating. The average peat accumulation rate at the eight sites varied from 0.35 +/- 0.03 to 1.13 +/- 0.02 mm yr(-1) and the LORCA values of bogs and fens varied from 19.0 +/- 1.1 to 69.0 +/- 4.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The accumulation rates had different trends especially during the early Holocene, caused by variations in vegetation succession resulting in differences in peat and carbon accumulation rates. The indirect effects of climate change through local hydrology appeared to be more important than direct influences of changes in precipitation and temperature. River valley fens were more drained during wetter periods as a result of deeper river incision, while bogs became wetter. From our dry bulk density results and our age-depth profiles we conclude that compaction is negligible and decay was not a relevant factor for undrained peatlands. These results contribute to our understanding of the influence of peatlands on the global carbon cycle and their potential impact on global change. (C) 2003 University of Washington.

AB Drained peatlands dominated by purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) are widespread in the UK and Western Europe. Although substantial carbon stores may be present in these peatlands, in this degraded state they are not currently acting as carbon sinks. Therefore, M.caerulea dominated peatlands have been identified as potential sites for ecohydrological restoration to tackle the current climate emergency. However, at present little is known about whether ditch blocking can raise water tables and promote the recovery of bog plant species, and the subsequent effects on carbon sequestration in these peatlands.
   To investigate the potential for restoration, we measured changes in water table depth, vegetation composition, photosynthesis at 1000 mu mol Photons m(-2) s(-1) (P-G1000), ecosystem respiration (R-Eco) and partitioned below-ground respiration in two M.caerulea dominated peatlands in which drainage ditches had been blocked located in Exmoor National Park, southwest England. Measurements were made in two headwater catchments at 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 of the distance between adjacent drainage ditches at four control-restored paired sites, during the growing seasons pre- (2012) and post- (2014, 2016 & 2018) restoration.
   Restoration had a small but significant (p = 0.009) effect on water table depths however, this did not result in a significant change in vegetation composition (p > 0.350). Ecosystem respiration increased in both the control and restored locations following restoration however, this increase was significantly smaller (p = 0.010) at the restored locations, possibly due to a similarly reduced increase in photosynthesis, although this change was not significant (p = 0.116). Below-ground respiration showed no significant changes following restoration.
   This research illustrates how degraded these shallow peatlands are, and raises concerns that ditch blocking alone may not bring about the high and stable water tables required to perturb the existing Molinia caerulea-dominated ecosystem and substantially alter the carbon balance. Additional restoration measures may be required.

AB Humic lakes and ponds receive large amounts of terrestrial carbon and are important components of the global carbon cycle, yet how their redox cycling influences the carbon budget is not fully understood. Here we compared metag-enomes obtained from a humic bog and a clear-water eutrophic lake and found a much larger number of genes that might be involved in extracellular electron transfer (EET) for iron redox reactions and humic substance (HS) reduction in the bog than in the clear-water lake, consistent with the much higher iron and HS levels in the bog. These genes were particularly rich in the bog's anoxic hypolimnion and were found in diverse bacterial lineages, some of which are relatives of known iron oxidizers or iron-HS reducers. We hypothesize that HS may be a previously overlooked electron acceptor and that EET-enabled redox cycling may be important in pelagic respiration and greenhouse gas budget in humic-rich freshwater lakes.

AB Peatlands are wetland ecosystems with great significance as natural habitats and as major global carbon stores. They have been subject to widespread exploitation and degradation with resulting losses in characteristic biota and ecosystem functions such as climate regulation. More recently, large-scale programmes have been established to restore peatland ecosystems and the various services they provide to society. Despite significant progress in peatland science and restoration practice, we lack a process-based understanding of how soil microbiota influence peatland functioning and mediate the resilience and recovery of ecosystem services, to perturbations associated with land use and climate change.
   We argue that there is a need to: in the short-term, characterise peatland microbial communities across a range of spatial and temporal scales and develop an improved understanding of the links between peatland habitat, ecological functions and microbial processes; in the medium term, define what a successfully restored 'target' peatland microbiome looks like for key carbon cycle related ecosystem services and develop microbial-based monitoring tools for assessing restoration needs; and in the longer term, to use this knowledge to influence restoration practices and assess progress on the trajectory towards 'intact' peatland status.
   Rapid advances in genetic characterisation of the structure and functions of microbial communities offer the potential for transformative progress in these areas, but the scale and speed of methodological and conceptual advances in studying ecosystem functions is a challenge for peatland scientists. Advances in this area require multidisciplinary collaborations between peatland scientists, data scientists and microbiologists and ultimately, collaboration with the modelling community.
   Developing a process-based understanding of the resilience and recovery of peatlands to perturbations, such as climate extremes, fires, and drainage, will be key to meeting climate targets and delivering ecosystem services cost effectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Changes of water table position influence carbon cycling in peatlands, but effects on the sources and sinks of carbon are difficult to isolate and quantify in field investigations due to seasonal dynamics and covariance of variables. We thus investigated carbon fluxes and dissolved carbon production in peatland mesocosms from two acidic and oligotrophic peatlands under steady state conditions at two different water table positions. Exchange rates and CO2, CH4 and DOC production rates were simultaneously determined in the peat from diffusive-advective mass-balances of dissolved CO2, CH4 and DOC in the pore water. Incubation experiments were used to quantify potential CO 2, CH4, and DOC production rates. The carbon turnover in the saturated peat was dominated by the production of DOC (10 - 15 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) with lower rates of DIC (6.1 - 8.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and CH4 (2.2 - 4.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) production. All production rates strongly decreased with depth indicating the importance of fresh plant tissue for dissolved C release. A lower water table decreased area based rates of photosynthesis (24 - 42%), CH4 production ( factor 2.5 - 3.5) and emission, increased rates of soil respiration and microbial biomass C, and did not change DOC release. Due to the changes in process rates the C net balance of the mesocosms shifted by 36 mmol m(-2) d(-1). According to our estimates the change in C mineralization contributed most to this change. Anaerobic rates of CO2 production rates deeper in the peat increased significantly by a factor of 2 - 3.5 ( DOC), 2.9 - 3.9 (CO2), and 3 - 14 (CH4) when the water table was lowered by 30 cm. This phenomenon might have been caused by easing an inhibiting effect by the accumulation of CO2 and CH4 when the water table was at the moss surface.

AB Aim Hydroclimatic shifts and anthropogenic-driven nitrogen deposition are major outcomes of global change that could compromise the functioning of many peatlands as a carbon sink. ForSphagnum-dominated peatlands, an emerging hypothesis is that the change could be triggered by shifts in competitive dominance among plant functional groups, specifically from the currently predominant decay-resistantSphagnumto the more decomposable vascular plants. However, the relationship betweenSphagnumand vascular plant occurrence is notably complex and also includes facilitative interactions that are crucial to the productivity ofSphagnum, and therefore, carbon sequestration. Location Global. Taxa Northern peatlands-Sphagnummoss and vascular plants. Time period Present day and the future. Methods We use a conceptual review to examine underlying mechanisms for the competitive exclusion hypothesis and the nature of facilitative interactions betweenSphagnumand vascular plants under potential global change conditions. We complement the review with an empirical study of peatlands with contrasting hydrology to provide some critical insights into the potential effects of change in plant communities on carbon sequestration. We also propose a conceptual model that presents probable combinations of global change factors and their implications for carbon sequestration. Results Vegetation structure inSphagnum-dominated peatland appears to be driven largely by hydrology, rather than competition among plant functional groups. The peat deposit also exerts some controls (e.g., nutrient immobilization) on biotic structure, thereby acting as resistance against an abrupt shift in plant communities. Main conclusions Peatland controls that constrain vegetation shifts have developed over a millennial time-scale in many peatlands, and the pace of climate change may not allow enough time for the establishment of those mechanisms in younger peatlands. Thus, the persistence of a given peatland as a carbon sink also likely depends on the successional stage of the peatland.

AB Mass balances of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) based on stream and precipitation inputs and outflows were measured for seven unproductive lakes in central Ontario between 1981 and 1989. Net annual CO2 evasion occurred in six of the seven study lakes with minor net invasion in the seventh. Atmospheric invasion might have been significant at certain times of the year, particularly during the growing season. Net evasion rates were greater than DIC loading rates, indicating partial mineralization of the terrestrially-derive DOC in the lakes. A steady state mass balance model adequately described the variation in DOC retention between lakes. Net annual carbon accumulation of forest communities based on estimates of net ecosystem production may be overestimated because of significant export of carbon to lakes via streams and groundwater, particularly in catchments with extensive peatlands.

AB The 2nd International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL 2007) - held 16-20 September 2007 in Tartu, Estonia - provided a forum for exchange of recent results, ideas and methods among researchers studying the cycling of nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, heavy metals, and organic pollutants in wetlands. The current special issue contains selected papers from the meeting focused on molecular and microbial techniques and processes of importance for substance cycling and pollutant removal in wetlands. It also includes a review of microbial processes in treatment wetlands that gives a good status description of our current knowledge of how different designs and operational conditions affect environmental factors that influence microbial densities, community composition and activities. The editorial paper highlights results from those papers, where the authors have linked process studies with biochemical and gene-based investigations to achieve a mechanistic understanding of observed processes, and/or the biology of the communities responsible for those processes.

AB An analysis of 1516 radiocarbon dates demonstrates that the development of the current circumarctic peatlands began similar to 16.5 thousand years ago (ka) and expanded explosively between 12 and 8 ka in concert with high summer insolation and increasing temperatures. Their rapid development contributed to the sustained peak in CH4 and modest decline of CO2 during the early Holocene and likely contributed to CH4 and CO2 fluctuations during earlier interglacial and interstadial transitions. Given the decreased tempo of peatland initiation in the late Holocene and the transition of many from fens (which generated high levels of CH4) to ombrotrophic bogs, a neoglacial expansion of northern peatlands cannot explain the increase in atmospheric CH4 that occurred after 6 ka.

AB We use paleoecological techniques to investigate how Canadian High Arctic wetlands responded to a mid-twentieth century increase in growing degree days. We observe an increase in wetness, moss diversity, and carbon accumulation in a polygon mire trough, likely related to ice wedge thaw. Contrastingly, the raised center of the polygon mire showed no clear response. Wet and dry indicator testate amoebae increased concomitantly in a valley fen, possibly relating to greater inundation from snowmelt followed by increasing evapotranspiration. This occurred alongside the appearance of generalist hummock mosses. A coastal fen underwent a shift from sedge to shrub dominance. The valley and coastal fens transitioned from minerogenic to organic-rich wetlands prior to the growing degree days increase. A subsequent shift to moss dominance in the coastal fen may relate to intensive grazing from Arctic geese. Our findings highlight the complex response of Arctic wetlands to warming and have implications for understanding their future carbon sink potential.
   Plain Language Summary The response of Arctic wetland ecosystems and carbon stores to climate change is uncertain. We investigate the response of wetland ecosystems in the Canadian High Arctic to twentieth century climate warming. We use proxies for changes in vegetation (plant macrofossils) and wetness (testate amoebae) preserved in the wetland soil in combination with radiocarbon dating to reconstruct the past ecology of these wetlands. This approach allows us to explore beyond the timeframe of monitoring studies. Our results suggest that wetland type is an important determinant of the response of ecological, hydrological, and soil carbon accumulation to climate warming. Our findings highlight the clear but complex response of Arctic wetlands to twentieth century warming. This has important implications for understanding the future carbon sink potential of these ecosystems.

AB Boreal peatlands represent globally important long term sinks of carbon; however, horticultural peat extraction disrupts this carbon sink function, converting these ecosystems to large sources of greenhouse gases. Peatland restoration mitigates these emissions but to date no measurement of greenhouse gas exchange has been conducted on restored peatlands in western Canada, a region where continental climate could impact restoration success. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes during the growing season in a restored, cutover peatland in northern Alberta (Boreal Plain Ecozone) and compared these to fluxes measured on a neighboring unrestored area. Restoration resulted in a shift in mean growing season fluxes from 378g CO2C and 0.2g CH4-C at the unrestored site to 30g CO2-C and 3.7g CH4-C at the restored site, where positive values indicate flux of carbon from the peatland to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide exchange was correlated to vascular vegetation cover that varied depending on local water table position. Water table was also related to CH4 flux, with higher emissions from wet sites. Restoration activities should avoid creating very dry microsites where greenhouse gas emissions will remain high, while very wet sites may accumulate carbon as CO2 but will likely create areas of high CH4 flux.

AB The annual net CO2 exchange over undisturbed deep peatland in Scotland was measured continuously for 22 months using eddy covariance. Annual CO2 exchanges over peatlands that had been drained, ploughed and afforested with conifers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 26 years previously were estimated by extrapolating two to four weekly measurements, using relationships between daytime fluxes and solar radiation and night-time fluxes and air temperature. The contribution of the trees to the overall net CO2 flux was estimated using a carbon accounting model, calibrated to fit conifer volume yield data. The carbon exchange of the peat and ground vegetation was then the difference between the overall carbon flux and the amount accumulated in trees and tree litter. The undisturbed peat accumulated similar to0.25 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Newly drained peatland (2-4 years after ploughing) emitted between 2 and 4 t C ha(-1) a(-1), but when ground vegetation recolonized, the peatland became a sink again, absorbing similar to3 t C ha(-1) a(-1) 4-8 years after tree planting. Thereafter, the trees dominated the budget and afforested peatlands absorbed up to 5 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Assuming that the trees accumulated carbon at rates commensurate with yield class 10 m(3) ha(-1) a(-1), the peat beneath the trees after canopy closure was estimated to be decomposing at only similar to1 t C ha(-1) a(-1) or less. This is slower than previously thought and suggested that afforested peatlands in Scotland accumulate more carbon in trees, litter, forest soil and products than is lost from the peat for 90-190 years.

AB Soil carbon in permafrost ecosystems has the potential to become a major positive feedback to climate change if permafrost thaw increases heterotrophic decomposition. However, warming can also stimulate autotrophic production leading to increased ecosystem carbon storage-a negative climate change feedback. Few studies partitioning ecosystem respiration examine decadal warming effects or compare responses among ecosystems. Here, we first examined how 11 years of warming during different seasons affected autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration in a bryophyte-dominated peatland in Abisko, Sweden. We used natural abundance radiocarbon to partition ecosystem respiration into autotrophic respiration, associated with production, and heterotrophic decomposition. Summertime warming decreased the age of carbon respired by the ecosystem due to increased proportional contributions from autotrophic and young soil respiration and decreased proportional contributions from old soil. Summertime warming's large effect was due to not only warmer air temperatures during the growing season, but also to warmer deep soils year-round. Second, we compared ecosystem respiration responses between two contrasting ecosystems, the Abisko peatland and a tussock-dominated tundra in Healy, Alaska. Each ecosystem had two different timescales of warming (<5years and over a decade). Despite the Abisko peatland having greater ecosystem respiration and larger contributions from heterotrophic respiration than the Healy tundra, both systems responded consistently to short- and long-term warming with increased respiration, increased autotrophic contributions to ecosystem respiration, and increased ratios of autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration. We did not detect an increase in old soil carbon losses with warming at either site. If increased autotrophic respiration is balanced by increased primary production, as is the case in the Healy tundra, warming will not cause these ecosystems to become growing season carbon sources. Warming instead causes a persistent shift from heterotrophic to more autotrophic control of the growing season carbon cycle in these carbon-rich permafrost ecosystems.

AB Nitrogen (N) accumulation rates in peatland ecosystems indicate significant biological atmospheric N-2 fixation associated with Sphagnum mosses. Here, we show that the linkage between methanotrophic carbon cycling and N-2 fixation may constitute an important mechanism in the rapid accumulation of N during the primary succession of peatlands. In our experimental stable isotope enrichment study, previously overlooked methane-induced N-2 fixation explained more than one-third of the new N input in the younger peatland stages, where the highest N-2 fixation rates and highest methane oxidation activities co-occurred in the water-submerged moss vegetation.

AB The presence and flux of biogenic methane-rich free phase gas that is eventually released to the atmosphere influence water content (theta) of peat soils below the water table. Small variations in gas content in peat soils at near-saturation theta could be inferred by changes in dielectric permittivity, but detailed measurements in that range of theta needed to develop calibration functions are lacking. Our experiment uses a new method for varying theta in the sample using elevated pressure to reduce the naturally occurring volumetric gas content in a manner similar to what occurs in situ under atmospheric pressure change, which relevant to understanding carbon gas cycling in peatlands. We recorded dielectric permittivity using a 1.6 MHz ground-penetrating radar antenna at multiple water contents between 0.87 and 0.95 m(3) m(-3) on four peat monoliths with varying levels of humification and with <5% gas content as is commonly observed in the field. We identified empirical equations that were linear over the range of theta investigated and optimized a dielectric mixing model for estimating theta from GPR. These results indicate that there are differences in the permittivity-theta relationships developed between peat samples and suggest that variability in dielectric relationships may be attributed to peat structure and particle orientation. The empirical relationships developed in this study confirm the utility of previously applied multiphase mixing models for estimating peat properties using methods sensitive to dielectric permittivity. This work is relevant to studies of gas content in peat and the role of peatlands in the carbon cycle.

AB [1] The contribution of wildfire in peatlands outside of boreal and tropical regions to interannual variability of global carbon emissions has been relatively little studied. There are 0.19 to 0.88 million km(2) of localized peat deposits in the temperate zone ( 30 - 50 degrees latitude) where drainage and climate change may affect the status of this potentially large carbon pool. For example, in the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA, where wildfire is common, over 325 teragrams of carbon (Tg C) are stored in peat deposits up to 5 m deep. We estimated carbon emissions for a temperate peatland fire in North Carolina using remote sensing to reconstruct burn severity and topographic lidar to constrain peat burn depths. Total carbon emissions for the fire ranged from 1 to 3.8 Tg, with spatially heterogeneous patterns of carbon fluxes (0.2 to 11 kg C m(-2)) responding to variation in vegetation type, peat burn depth, soil substrate ( mineral or organic), and fire severity. To maintain a carbon sink in this region at the current rates of carbon sequestration (0.109 to 0.127 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) we estimated a fire return interval of greater than 20 - 80 years. Continued drainage and future drought could decrease the fire return interval to less than 20 years or increase peat burn depths thereby converting these peatlands into a net carbon source. On a global scale, this study suggests that temperate peatland fires may emit up to 0.32 petagrams of carbon during drought years, a significant contribution to interannual greenhouse gas variability.

AB The concentration of atmospheric methane is strongly linked to variations in Earth's climate. Currently, we can directly reconstruct the total atmospheric concentration of methane, but not individual terms of the methane cycle. Northern wetlands, dominated by Sphagnum, are an important contributor of atmospheric methane, and we seek to understand the methane cycle in these systems. We present a novel method for quantifying the proportion of carbon Sphagnum assimilates from its methanotrophic symbionts using stable isotope ratios of leaf-wax biomarkers. Carbon isotope ratios of Sphagnum compounds are determined by two competing influences, water content and the isotope ratio of source carbon. We disentangled these effects using a combined hydrogen and carbon isotope approach. We constrained Sphagnum water content using the contrast between the hydrogen isotope ratios of Sphagnum and vascular plant biomarkers. We then used Sphagnum water content to calculate the carbon isotope ratio of Sphagnum's carbon pool. Using a mass balance equation, we calculated the proportion of recycled methane contributed to the Sphagnum carbon pool, "PRM." We quantified PRM in peat monoliths from three microhabitats in the Mer Bleue peatland complex. Modern studies have shown that water table depth and vegetation have strong influences on the peatland methane cycle on instrumental time scales. With this new approach, delta C-13 of Sphagnum compounds are now a useful tool for investigating the relationships among hydrology, vegetation, and methanotrophy in Sphagnum peatlands over the time scales of entire peatland sediment records, vital to our understanding of the global carbon cycle through the Late Glacial and Holocene.

AB Northern peatlands have been a persistent natural carbon sink since the Last Glacial Maximum. The continued growth and expansion of these carbon-rich ecosystems could offset a large portion of anthropogenic carbon emissions before the end of the present interglacial period. Here we used an impeded drainage model and gridded data on the depth to bedrock and the fraction of histosol-type soils to evaluate the limits to the growth of northern peatland carbon stocks. Our results show that the potential carbon stock in northern peatlands could reach a total of 875 +/- 125 PgC before the end of the present interglacial, which could, as a result, remove 330 +/- 200 PgC of carbon from the atmosphere. We argue that northern peatlands, together with the oceans, will potentially play an important role in reducing the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over the next 5000 years.

AB Peatlands are long term carbon catchments that sink atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and source methane (CH4). in the uplands of the United Kingdom ombrotrophic blanket peatlands commonly exist within Calluna vulgaris (L.) dominated moorland ecosystems. These landscapes contain a range of topographical features that influence local hydrology, climate and plant community composition. In this study we examined the variation in ecosystem CO2 respiration and net CH4 fluxes from typical plant-soil systems in dendritic drainage gullies and adjacent blanket peat during the growing season. Typically, Eriophorum spp., Sphagnum spp. and mixed grasses occupied gullies while C. uulgaris dominated in adjacent blanket peat. Gross CO2 respiration was highest in the areas of Eriophorum spp. (650 +/- 140 Mg CO2 m(-2)h(-1)) compared to those with Sphagnum spp. (338 +/- 49 mg CO2 m(-2)h(-1)), mixed grasses (342 +/- 91 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) and C. vulgaris (174 +/- 63 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)). Measurements of the net CH4 flux showed higher fluxes from the Eriophorum spp (2.2 +/- 0.6 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) locations compared to the Sphagnurn spp. (0.6 +/- 0.4 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), mixed grasses (0.1 +/- 0.1 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) and a negligible flux detected from C. uulgaris (0.0 +/- 0.0 mg CH4 m(-2)h(-1)) locations. A GIS approachwas applied to calculate the contribution of gullies to landscape scale greenhouse gas fluxes. Findings from the Moor House National Nature Reserve in the UK showed that although gullies occupied only 9.3% of the total land surface, gullies accounted for 95.8% and 21.6% of the peatland net CH4 and CO2 respiratory fluxes, respectively. The implication of these findings is that the relative contribution of characteristic gully systems need to be considered in estimates of landscape scale peatland greenhouse gas fluxes.

AB This study estimates the complete carbon budget of an 11.4 km(2) peat-covered catchment in Northern England. The budget considers both fluvial and gaseous carbon fluxes and includes estimates of particulate organic carbon (POC); dissolved organic carbon (DOC); excess dissolved CO2: release of methane (CH4): net ecosystem respiration of CO2: and uptake of CO2 by primary productivity. All components except CH4 were measured directly in the catchment and annual carbon budgets were calculated for the catchment between 1993 and 2005 using both extrapolation and interpolation methods. The study shows that: Over the 13 year study period the total carbon balance varied between a net sink of -20 to -91 Mg C/km(2)/yr. The biggest component of this budget is the uptake of carbon by primary productivity (-178 Mg C/km(2)/yr) and in most years the second largest component is the loss of DOC from the peat profile (+39 Mg C/km(2)/yr). Direct exchanges of C with the atmosphere average -89 Mg C/km(2)/yr in the catchment. Extrapolating the general findings of the carbon budget across all UK peatlands results in an approximate carbon balance of -1.2 Tg C/yr (+/-0.4 Pg C/yr) which is larger than previously reported values. Carbon budgets should always be reported with a clear statement of the techniques used and errors involved as this is significant when comparing results across studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding how archaeal communities are affected by water-table drawdown is essential for predicting soil functional responses to future climate change and the consequences of the responses on the soil carbon cycle.
   We investigated the effect of water-table drawdown, warming, drought, and combinations thereof on archaeal communities using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and quantitative PCR.
   Methanosarcinales, Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriales, uncultured Rice Cluster II (RC-II), and uncultured Crenarchaeota were detected. Water-table drawdown and drought exhibited significant effects on the archaeal communities. When the water table was at or above 10 cm, the archaeal abundance at 10 cm remained high (approximately 10(9) cells per gram dry soil), whereas the archaeal abundance at 10 cm was reduced to approximately 10(8) cells per gram dry soil where the water table was lowered to 20 cm or below. When the water table kept constant, warming caused a significant reduction in the archaeal abundance, whereas drought only caused a decrease in archaeal abundance when the water table was higher than -20 cm.
   Results suggest that changes in water table may directly impact archaeal community abundance and assemblage which can in turn influence methane emissions, potentially on a large scale. Our results also indicate that archaeal communities response to water-table drawdowns that are dependent on the initial ecohydrology.

AB Warming climate is thawing the permafrost in arctic and subarctic regions, leading to formation of thermokarst ponds. During the formation and geomorphological succession of these ponds, carbon that has been trapped in frozen soils for thousands of years is hydrologically mobilized and returned to the active carbon cycle. We sampled 12 thermokarst ponds representing three different stages of pond succession to study the potential of microbial communities to metabolize the organic carbon in the water. We investigated the quality of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water column based on the spectrophotometric and fluorometric properties of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter combined with parallel factor analysis and the potential of the microbial community for degrading these carbon compounds based on genetic markers related to carbon degradation. Our analysis showed a clear difference in the DOC quality across the different developmental stages. In the younger ponds, organic matter quality suggested that it was originating from the degrading permafrost and in the metagenomes collected from these ponds, the normalized abundance of genes related to degradation of carbon compounds was higher. There was also a shift in the degradation potential in the water column of the ponds, with higher potential for organic matter degradation in deeper, anoxic layers. In conclusion, our results show that the DOC quality and the genetic potential of the microbial community for carbon cycling change across the pond ontogeny, suggesting a capacity of the microbial communities to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

AB In a context of climate change peatlands may switch from a sink to a source of carbon (C). The induced positive feedbacks are closely linked to C dynamics, and thus to the fate of organic matter (OM) in the underlying peat. Our aims were to determine how moisture conditions in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland affect the dynamics of diagenetic sensitive OM which is thought to be the most reactive to warming effects. The approach was based on the identification of combined bulk and molecular bioindicators of OM sources and decay of peat profiles (up to 50 cm in depth) from two moisture conditions of the Le Forbonnet peatland (Jura Mountains, France). The (xylose + arabinose)/(galactose + rhamnose + mannose) ratio derived from the analysis of neutral monosaccharides was used to obtain indications on the botanical origin of the peat and tended to indicate a greater contribution of Cyperaceae in the deepest parts of the peat. Most bioindicators showed that OM decay increased with depth and was higher in the driest conditions. In these conditions, decay was shown by a loss of diagenetic sensitive oxygen-rich OM, probably leached by water table fluctuations. Decay intensity was also shown by the high ribose and lyxose contents at the peat surface, where microscopic observations also revealed relatively large quantities of fungal hyphae. The sugars could have arisen from microbial synthesis, primarily protozoan and fungal activity. These results suggest that water level changes preferentially impact biochemical changes in diagenetic sensitive OM, believed to be sensitive to drought events.

ID NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; TURNOVER; BARLEY; CARBON
AB In a long-term field experiment started in 1956 on a clay loam soil at Uppsala, Sweden, changes of organic carbon in the topsoils receiving various organic amendments at the rate of 2000 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) were studied to determine soil organic matter characteristics, variations of delta(13)C in the soil and to estimate a carbon balance. Fallow and mineral fertilizer without N led to a significant decrease of soil organic matter (SOM) in the soil, green manure maintained the SOM content, and animal manure and peat increased the SOM content significantly. The stable portion of the added organic materials after 37 years of continuous input was 12.8, 27.3, and 56.7%, for green manure, animal manure and peat, respectively. This was reflected by half-lives of organic carbon originating from the amendments between 3.0 (green manure) and 14.6 years (peat). The isotopic composition of SOM changed both due to mineralization (continuous fallow) and the addition of amendments isotopically different from soil humus (green manure, animal manure). The isotopic effect was used to calculate the percentage of carbon derived from animal manure present for the year 1993. This value (55.4%) was larger than that derived from the carbon balance, which indicated a priming effect of the animal manure on the initial soil humus. Mineralization of microbially available organic substances led to an increase in the degree of humification on plots not receiving organic amendments. Adding peat and animal manure resulted in a decrease of the humification index due to the continuous input of poorly humified material. The extinction ratio (E-4/E-6) and ratio of fulvic acid to humic acid changed considerably in the peat treated plots. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)-measurements of the extracts showed that peat characteristics can be detected in peat treated soils. The other amendments did not alter the characteristics of the extractable humic substances.

AB The Bern3D model was applied to quantify the mechanisms of carbon cycle changes during the Holocene (last 11,000 years). We rely on scenarios from the literature to prescribe the evolution of shallow water carbonate deposition and of land carbon inventory changes over the glacial termination (18,000 to 11,000 years ago) and the Holocene and modify these scenarios within uncertainties. Model results are consistent with Holocene records of atmospheric CO2 and delta C-13 as well as the spatiotemporal evolution of delta C-13 and carbonate ion concentration in the deep sea. Deposition of shallow water carbonate, carbonate compensation of land uptake during the glacial termination, land carbon uptake and release during the Holocene, and the response of the ocean-sediment system to marine changes during the termination contribute roughly equally to the reconstructed late Holocene pCO(2) rise of 20 ppmv. The 5 ppmv early Holocene pCO(2) decrease reflects terrestrial uptake largely compensated by carbonate deposition and ocean sediment responses. Additional small contributions arise from Holocene changes in sea surface temperature, ocean circulation, and export productivity. The Holocene pCO(2) variations result from the subtle balance of forcings and processes acting on different timescales and partly in opposite direction as well as from memory effects associated with changes occurring during the termination. Different interglacial periods with different forcing histories are thus expected to yield different pCO(2) evolutions as documented by ice cores.

AB Northern peatlands are globally significant soil carbon sinks but contribute a significant amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to streams. Climate change driven warming and drying will likely alter peatland DOC dynamics; however, few field studies have quantified the individual and interactive effects of temperature and moisture changes. Using a full factorial water table (control, drained 2 years [experimental], drained 12 years [drained]) x warming (ambient, open-top chamber warming) x microform (hummock, hollow) study design, we monitored DOC concentration and spectrophotometric properties (specific ultraviolet absorbance [SUVA], E2/E3, E4/E6) in a wooded boreal bog in Alberta, Canada. Ecohydrological conditions including water table (WT), soil temperature, plant cover, biomass, and productivity were also measured at each plot. We observed a significant interaction between WT treatment, warming and microform for explaining variation in DOC concentrations, with the highest values at drained, warmed hummocks. Overall, drainage resulted in higher DOC concentration. DOC concentration and E2/E3 increased, whereas SUVA decreased, in response to greater plant productivity (i.e., more negative values of gross ecosystem photosynthesis). For DOC concentration and SUVA, this correlation was largely driven by drained, warmed hummocks where shrub growth increased. Moreover, redundancy analysis indicated that shrub and lichen cover, along with WT and soil temperature, were important for explaining variation in DOC concentration and quality. The results indicate that, although DOC concentrations in peatlands are likely to increase under climate change, much of this increase may be from recent carbon fixation, suggesting more rapid carbon cycling as opposed to destabilization of existing carbon stocks.

AB In a mesocosm experiment, with bare peat soils exposed to different water levels (WL), we examined whether heterotrophic respiration (R(h)) acclimated to a 3 degrees C temperature increase. Across all WLs, R(h) at 15 degrees C was never lower in the heated treatment than in the unheated treatment, indicating that Rh did not acclimate to the warmer conditions. We hypothesize that this lack of thermal acclimation is due to the unlimited substrate availability in these organic soils. These results imply that peat soils may exhibit a sustained positive feedback to global warming. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In sub-arctic and arctic regions mercury is an element of concern for both wildlife and humans. Over thousands of years large amounts of atmospherically deposited mercury, both from natural and anthropogenic sources, have been sequestered together with carbon in northern peatlands. Many of these peatlands are currently underlain by permafrost, which controls mire stability and hydrology. With the ongoing climate change there is concern that permafrost thawing will turn large areas of these northern peatlands from carbon/mercury-sinks into much wetter carbon/mercury-sources. Here we can show that such a change in mire structure in the sub-arctic Stordalen mire in northern Sweden actually is responsible for an increased export of mercury to the adjacent lake Inre Harrsjon. We also show that sediment mercury accumulation rates during a warm period in the pre-industrial past were higher than in the 1970s when atmospheric input peaked, indicating that in areas with permafrost, climate can have an effect on mercury loading to lakes as large as anthropogenic emissions. Thawing of permafrost and the subsequent export of carbon is a widespread phenomenon, and the projection is that it will increase even more in the near future. Together with our observations from Stordalen, this makes northern peatlands into a substantial source of mercury, at risk of being released into sensitive arctic freshwater and marine systems.

AB This study presents the carbon budget of a blanket bog, North Pennines, UK, subject to grazing and prescribed burning for vegetation management. The budget considers both fluvial and gaseous carbon fluxes and the following uptake and release pathways: dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, excess dissolved CO2, release of methane (CH4), net ecosystem respiration of CO2, and uptake of CO2 through primary productivity. Measurements of CH4 were not directly measured as part of this study but were estimated from hydroclimatic variables measured within the study. The results show that, if management combinations were extrapolated across the catchment, then over a 3 year period, the catchment would be a net source of carbon of between 62 and 206 gC m (2) yr (1). The action of both burning and grazing was to significantly decrease the magnitude of the carbon source relative to unburnt controls. Over the study period burnt sites were a mean source of approximately 117.8 gC m(-2) yr(-1) compared to unburnt sites with a mean source of 156.7 gC m(-2) yr(-1). Even when including the loss of carbon during the vegetation combustion, there are conditions under which the long-term loss of carbon is less than if no burning had occurred. If total combustion of vegetation occurs, provided burning occurs at cycles longer than 32 years, then less carbon is predicted to be lost than in a no-burn scenario.

AB Alpine ecosystems are, similar to arctic ecosystems, characterized by a very long snow season. Previous studies investigating arctic or alpine ecosystems have shown that winter CO2 effluxes can dominate the annual balance and that the timing and duration of the snow cover plays a crucial role for plant growth and phenology and might also influence the growing season ecosystem CO2 strength and dynamics. The objective of this study was to analyze seasonal and annual CO2 balances of a grassland site at an elevation of 2440 m a.s.l in the Swiss central Alps. We continuously measured the NEP using the eddy covariance method from June 2013 to October 2014, covering two growing seasons and one winter. We analyzed the influence of snow melt date on the CO2 exchange dynamics at this site, because snow melt differed about 24 days between the 2 years. To this end, we employed a process-based ecosystem carbon cycling model to disentangle the co-occurring effects of growing season length, environmental conditions during the growing season, and physiological/structural properties of the canopy on the ecosystem carbon balance. During the measurement period, the site was a net sink for CO2 although winter efflux contributed significantly to the total balance. The cumulative growing season NEP as well as mean and maximum daily CO2 uptake rates was lower during the year with the later snow melt, and the results indicated that the differences were mainly due to differing growing season lengths.

AB Carbon cycling is central to nutrient dynamics and accretion rates in wetlands.  Drainage and conversion of wetlands has been occurring at an accelerating rate.  This paper compares decay rates in natural and disturbed peatlands in the southeastern USA and examines relationships between edaphic factors and decay rates.  Cellulose decay rates (as tensile strength loss of cotton fibers) were used to compare decomposition potentials in these peatlands.  A 1984 pilot experiment included undisturbed short pocosin and several sites under various stages of agricultural conversion.  A spring 1987 experiment included an increasing nutrient availability gradient in undisturbed communities from short pocosin to tall pocosin to gum swamp, drained pocosin with natural vegetation remaining, and pocosin converted to pine forestry and agriculture.  In the 1984 experiment, disturbed sites had decay rates approximately nine times greater than undisturbed pocosin.  In the 1987 experiment, disturbed sites had decay rates from 1.8 to 10.3 times natural sites.  The greatest decay rates occurred in the agricultural site with its high nutrients, less acidic conditions, and relatively low soil moisture.  Drained pocosin had the next highest decay rates, although pH and nutrients were low.  Pine (Pinus taeda L.) forestry had intermediate rates of decay, while undisturbed sites had low rates.  The more nutrient-rich, but wet and low pH, gum swamp site had similar or slightly higher rates than the pocosin sites.  Drainage, relieving excessive soil moisture and the resultant anaerobiosis, was the dominant factor explaining the greater decay rates in the disturbed sites.  Other factors, such as nutrient availability and low pH, may have had secondary effects on cellulose decay.  Rates were also compared to a global data set based on potential evapotranspiration.  Natural sites have rates very close to those predicted, while disturbed sites have much higher rates (1.9-4.4 x predicted).

AB Peatland ecosystems are generally carbon (C) sinks. However, the role of dissolved organic C (DOC) relative to gaseous fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in the C balance of these ecosystems has not often been studied. Dissolved C fluxes are important for understanding C partitioning within the peatland and the potential C drainage from it. This research was conducted in Burns Bog, a heavily impacted ecosystem near Vancouver, Canada, undergoing ecological restoration efforts by rewetting. Here we present data on (i) ecosystem-scale fluxes of CO2 (net ecosystem exchange, NEE) and CH4 (FCH4) determined by eddy covariance, (ii) evasion fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from the water surface to estimate the role of open water in ecosystem-scale fluxes, and (iii) DOC flux (fDOC) in water draining from the peatland. Our results showed that open water areas inside the footprint were a continual C source, emitting 47.0 +/- 2.4 g C.m(-2).year(-1). DOC export (15.6 g C.m(-2).year(-1)) was significant to the net ecosystem C balance, decreasing the magnitude of the eddy covariance-determined C balance (i.e., NEE + FCH4) of -45.0 +/- 16.8 g C.m(-2).year(-1) by 35%, resulting in a net ecosystem C balance (i.e., NEE + FCH4 + fDOC) of-29.7 +/- 17.0 g C.m(-2).year(-1). Most of this offset occurred during the wetter nongrowing season when gross primary production was low and fDOC was relatively high.
   Plain Language Summary Healthy peatlands can store large amounts of carbon, but disturbance may turn a peatland into a carbon emitter. We studied the amount of carbon entering and leaving a disturbed peatland that has recently undergone ecological restoration by rewetting. We measured climate conditions and ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes in Burns Bog, a heavily impacted raised bog in the Fraser River Delta, BC, Canada. We also collected water samples and estimated evasion fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from the open water, as well as drainage fluxes of dissolved organic carbon. From these data, we estimated the amount of carbon entering and leaving the ecosystem. We found that open water areas continually emit carbon to the atmosphere, but the ecosystem as a whole is accumulating carbon on an annual basis. Accounting for the dissolved carbon exported by water reduces the estimates of carbon accumulation based on gas fluxes alone. These results have implications for restoration management of peatlands, which mainly consist of raising the water table level, and the role of peatland ecosystems within the context of global climate change.

AB Peatlands are characterized by their large carbon (C) storage capacity and represent important C sinks globally. In southern Chile, young peatlands (few centuries old) have originated due to clearcutting or fire at forest sites with high precipitation on poorly drained soils. These novel ecosystems are called anthropogenic peatlands here. Their role in the regional C cycle remains largely unknown. Here, we present 18 months of eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in an anthropogenic peatland in northern Chiloe Island, part of which is kept undisturbed for 30-40 years, by excluding human uses, and another section of the same peatland that has been disturbed by cattle grazing and Sphagnum moss extraction. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) were modeled from NEE, based on measured photosynthetically active radiation and air temperature, separately for each section of the peatland. Uncertainties of the annual flux estimates were assessed from the variability of modelled fluxes induced by applying different time-windows for model development between 10 and 20 days. The undisturbed area of the peatland was on average (+/- SD) a larger net CO2 sink (NEE=-135 +/- 267 gCO(2)m(-2)year(-1)) than the disturbed area (NEE=-33 +/- 111 gCO(2)m(-2)year(-1)). These NEE CO2 balances are small even though GPP and R-eco were larger compared with other peatlands. R-eco had a direct relationship with water table depth (from soil surface) and a negative relationship with soil water fraction. Our results show that the disturbance by moss extraction and cattle grazing is likely to reduce the CO2 sink function of many anthropogenic and natural peatlands on Chiloe Island, which are subjected to the same impacts.

AB The fate of the vast stocks of organic carbon stored in permafrost of the Western Siberian Lowland, the world's largest peat-land, is uncertain. Specifically, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from rivers in the region is unknown. Here we present estimates of annual CO2 emissions from 58 rivers across all permafrost zones of the Western Siberian Lowland, between 56 and 67 degrees N. We find that emissions peak at the permafrost boundary, and decrease where permafrost is more prevalent and in colder climatic conditions. River CO2 emissions were high, and on average two times greater than downstream carbon export. We suggest that high emissions and emission/export ratios are a result of warm temperatures and the long transit times of river water. We show that rivers in the Western Siberian Lowland play an important role in the carbon cycle by degassing terrestrial carbon before its transport to the Arctic Ocean, and suggest that changes in both temperature and precipitation are important for understanding and predicting high-latitude river CO2 emissions in a changing climate.

AB QuestionA better understanding of the response of Sphagnum mosses and associated vascular plants to climate warming is relevant for predicting the carbon balance of peatlands in a warmer world. Open-top chambers (OTCs) have been used to investigate the effect on soil biogeochemical processes in peatlands, but little information is available on the effects of OTCs on microclimate conditions and the associated response of the plant community. We aimed to understand how simulated warming and differences in soil moisture affect plant species cover.
   LocationA Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in French Jura.
   MethodsWe used OTCs to measure the effect of a near-ground temperature increase (+1.5 degrees C on average) on vegetation dynamics over five growing seasons (2008-2012) in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland, in two adjacent microhabitats with different hydrological conditions - wet and dry. Microclimatic conditions and plant species abundance were monitored at peak biomass in years 1, 2, 3 and 5 and monthly during the plant growing season in year 5.
   ResultsThe response to warming differed between vascular plants and bryophytes, as well as among species within these groups, and also varied in relation to soil moisture. Andromeda polifolia abundance responded positively to warming, while Vaccinium oxycoccus responded negatively, and Eriophorum vaginatum showed a high resistance.
   ConclusionDepth of rooting of vascular plants appeared to control the response in plant abundance, while moss abundance depended on various other interacting factors, such as shading by the vascular plant community, precipitation and soil moisture.

TI Absorption of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide by the Wetland Ecosystems of
   Russia in Holocene. The Problems of Paludification
SO LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE wetland ecosystems; Holocene; carbon; accumulation; peat; modeling
AB Wetland ecosystems are the net carbon (atmospheric carbon dioxide) sink for the atmosphere. The analysis of paludification speed and intensity of carbon accumulation in the peat in Russia during the Holocene is presented. During that period most of the peat bogs were formed in Russia. According to the current estimates, the area of peat bogs is 1.68 million km(2), with wetlands - 3.69 million km(2). All these lands contain more than 100 billion tons of carbon (Gt 100.93). Russia ranks first in the world in terms of accumulated peat. Annually 66 thousand Ha are swamped in the world. The average speed of paludification in Russia in Holocene was 15... 18 thousand Ha per year. It varied under the influence of changing climatic, hydrological, geological, morphological and other factors, and it was significantly different in some natural zones and regions of Russia. For example, the average rate of paludification in Karelia (north-western part of Russia) in Holocene was 400 ha per year, while it ranged from 150 to 755 ha per year. The most intensive logging and peat accumulation was found during the Atlantic period of Holocene, when the types of wetland ecosystems and their balance were changed. The other areas of North-Western and Western Siberia of the Russian Federation have similarities of waterlogging. To date, the numerous data on the rate of carbon and peat accumulation in bog ecosystems of different types an average during the Holocene are gathered in Russia. These results are not complete and, unfortunately, make it impossible to determine the current rate of accumulation of organic matter in the marshes and the nature of the ecosystem functioning (whether a marsh is a net sink or a net source of carbon dioxide for the atmosphere). Marsh drainage may increase the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. To determine the current (over the seasons, decades) rate of net carbon accumulation the balance method and the method of mathematical modeling of the marsh ecosystem are used. The calculations of the present rate of net carbon accumulation by the swamps according to the R. Clymo model (as modified by I.E. Turchinovich) showed that it was 37.6 million tons of carbon per year. Currently, the process of paludification in Russia have been intensified as a result of the global climate changes and extensive damage of the drainage systems.

AB Belowground climate change responses remain a key unknown in the Earth system. Plant fine-root response is especially important to understand because fine roots respond quickly to environmen-tal change, are responsible for nutrient and water uptake, and influence carbon cycling. However, fine-root responses to climate change are poorly constrained, especially in northern peatlands, which contain up to two-thirds of the world's soil carbon. We present fine-root responses to warming between +2 degrees C and 9 degrees C above ambient conditions in a whole-ecosystem peatland experi-ment. Warming strongly increased fine-root growth by over an order of magnitude in the warmest treatment, with stronger re-sponses in shrubs than in trees or graminoids. In the first year of treatment, the control (+0 degrees C) shrub fine-root growth of 0.9 km m(-2) y(-1) increased linearly by 1.2 km m(-2) y(-1) (130%) for every degree increase in soil temperature. An extended below -ground growing season accounted for 20% of this dramatic in-crease. In the second growing season of treatment, the shrub warming response rate increased to 2.54 km m(-2) degrees C-1. Soil mois-ture was negatively correlated with fine-root growth, highlighting that drying of these typically water-saturated ecosystems can fuel a surprising burst in shrub belowground productivity, one possible mechanism explaining the "shrubification" of northern peatlands in response to global change. This previously unrecognized mech-anism sheds light on how peatland fine-root response to warming and drying could be strong and rapid, with consequences for the belowground growing season duration, microtopography, vegetation composition, and ultimately, carbon function of these globally relevant carbon sinks.

AB Recent research shows that inland water may play some role in carbon cycling though its contribution has remained uncertain due to a limited reliable data. From the viewpoint of scale similarity and discontinuity of eco-hydrological processes, it is important to identify spatial coupling of ecosystems including energy, materials, and organisms flows across their boundaries. One of the fundamentals of eco-hydrology model is to incorporate a complex relation between soil, water, temperature, plant, and carbon. In this paper, the author reviewed previous progress in eco-hydrology model focusing on surface-groundwater connectivity and hydrologic-geomorphic-ecological processes interaction. He also reviewed the recent progress in modeling, the role of inland water on biogeochemical cycle by compiling various datasets of hydrological and biogeochemical cycle. Then, he showed a new advanced model coupling eco-hydrology and biogeochemical cycle (NICE-BGC). The model results of both CO2 evasion and carbon transport to the ocean were reasonably in good agreement with previous data. In order to decrease uncertainty about carbon cycle, it became clear the previous empirical estimation should be extended to this process-oriented model and higher resolution data to further clarify mechanistic interplay between inorganic and organic carbon and its relationship to nitrogen and phosphorus in terrestrial-aquatic linkages. NICE-BGC would play important role in re-evaluation of greenhouse gas budget of the biosphere, quantification of hot spots, and bridging gap between top-down and bottom-up approaches in global carbon budget. This will also help to integrate knowledge and provide understanding needed for reaching sustainability by 2030 in UN Sustainable Development Goals.

AB Although root litter contributes to a large extent to soil organic matter accumulation in peatlands, decomposition of root litter is often neglected in studies on litter decomposition and carbon and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. In this study, decomposition of root and rhizome litter of Carex diandra and Carex lasiocarpa was determined in two temperate fens, one dominated by Sphagnum species (Sphagnum, fen; soil pH = 4.4) and one without a Sphagnum cover Carex fen: soil pH = 5.7. One-year mass loss increased in the order: roots Carex diandra < roots Carex lasiocarpa < rhizomes Carex lasiocarpa. This ranking was in agreement with the generally established relationships between decomposition rate and litter chemistry, since rhizome litter had the lowest concentration of lignin and the highest nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. The decomposition constants (k-values) varied from 0.10 to 0.30 yr(-1), which is at the low end of the range found for above-ground litter of Carex species in other studies. Decomposition rates of root litter were lower in the Sphagnum site than in the Carex site, probably as a result of a lower pH and a lower nutrient status in the Sphragnum site. At both sites, N and P content of the litter decreased rapidly in the first three months indicating fast nutrient leaching and mineralization. Nutrient release per unit initial litter mass in the Carex site did not differ from that in the Sphagnum site. Estimated first year losses of N and P from Carex diandra roots in the Carex site were 2.31 g N m(-2) and 0.20 g P m(-2) First-pear nutrient losses From leaf litter of this species, as determined in another study, were only 0.06 g N m(-2) and 0.02 g P m(-2). These results show that roots do indeed play a major role in the cycling of carbon and nutrients in temperate fen ecosystems.

AB Decreasing snow cover in winter resulting from climate warming increases the incidence of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) in many ecosystems, including peatlands. As peatland ecosystems form a globally significant long-term carbon storage, understanding the effects of changing conditions in winter on carbon dynamics is essential. We studied how FTCs affect peatland carbon cycling by conducting mesocosm experiments with Sphagnum. Our results indicate an overall impeding effect of FTCs on Sphagnum photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, ecosystem respiration and enzymatic processes. A threefold reduction in photosynthesis in the FTC treatment was related to a decrease in chlorophyll content, showing that Sphagnum physiologically suffers from repeated FTCs. In the FTC treatment beta-glucosidase and phosphatase enzymatic activities decreased by 50% and 30%, respectively, whilst alanine remained unaffected, indicating that in peat soils short-term FTCs affect the carbon and phosphorus cycles, but not the nitrogen cycle. Long-term effects of FTCs deserve further studies.

AB Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas controlled by both biotic and abiotic processes. Few studies have investigated CH4 fluxes in subarctic heath ecosystems, and climate change-induced shifts in CH4 flux and the overall carbon budget are therefore largely unknown. Hence, there is an urgent need for long-term in situ experiments allowing for the study of ecosystem processes over time scales relevant to environmental change. Here we present in situ CH4 and CO2 flux measurements from a wet heath ecosystem in northern Sweden subjected to 16 years of manipulations, including summer warming with open-top chambers, birch leaf litter addition, and the combination thereof. Throughout the snow-free season, the ecosystem was a net sink of CH4 and CO2 (CH4 -0.27 mg C m(-2) d(-1); net ecosystem exchange -1827 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), with highest CH4 uptake rates (-0.70 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during fall. Warming enhanced net CO2 flux, while net CH4 flux was governed by soil moisture. Litter addition and the combination with warming significantly increased CH4 uptake rates, explained by a pronounced soil drying effect of up to 32% relative to ambient conditions. Both warming and litter addition also increased the seasonal average concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the soil. The site was a carbon sink with a net uptake of 60 g Cm-2 over the snow-free season. However, warming reduced net carbon uptake by 77%, suggesting that this ecosystem type might shift from snow-free season sink to source with increasing summer temperatures.
   Plain Language Summary: Much attention has been directed toward methane (CH4) dynamics in peatlands and wet ecosystems at high latitudes, which are considered net CH4 sources which intensify the greenhouse effect and lead to further warming. However, few studies have hitherto investigated CH4 fluxes in subarctic heath ecosystems, which likely exhibit both CH4 production and uptake. Therefore, climate-induced changes in CH4 exchange and the overall carbon balance are largely unknown. In this unique long-term field experiment, we investigated the response of biological CH4 uptake (microbial CH4 consumption) to increased summer warming by open-top chambers and deciduous leaf litter input in a wet heath ecosystem in northern Sweden, representative of a large proportion of the tundra landscape. We found that leaf litter addition significantly increases CH4 uptake rates due to a pronounced soil drying effect, which is intensified in combination with warming. Warming enhances CO2 release, while CH4 uptake is controlled by soil moisture. The study demonstrates the sensitivity and capacity of a wet heath ecosystem to function as a net CH4 sink. However, it was also shown that higher summer temperatures might shift the ecosystem toward a net carbon source due to an increase in CO2 release, thereby enhancing the greenhouse effect.

AB Black carbon (BC), composed of char and soot, is an important component of soil organic carbon (SOC), and these materials are potentially important for the global carbon cycle and global climate. A thermal-optical reflectance method was used to determine the spatial patterns of SOC, BC, char and soot in nine soil types collected from 152 sites in the Qinghai Lake catchment. All of the analytes showed large spatial variability: SOC, BC and char were most abundant in bog soils and least abundant in aeolian soils, while soot concentrations in alpine frost desert and in aeolian soils were about half of those in the other soils. The average BC concentration in the 0-20-cm soil layers was 1.3gkg(-1), and BC amounted to 5.6% of the SOC. Char, SOC and BC all decreased with soil depth, but soot showed little variation. The proportions of BC to SOC and char to BC showed contrasting trends in four soil profiles; the former increased and the latter decreased with depth. The quantity of SOC sequestered in topsoils of the catchment area was estimated to be 191Tg; BC accounted for approximately 4.8% of this, and char made up approximately 85% of the total BC stock. The burning of animal dung for domestic cooking apparently was an important source of soil BC: combustion of other biofuels and fossil fuels was the other main source.

AB Knowledge on soil microbial respiration (SMR) rates and thus soil-related CO2 losses from Arctic soils is vital because of the crucial importance of this ecosystem within the global carbon (C) cycle and climate system. Here, we measured SMR from various habitats during the growing season in Russian subarctic tundra by applying two different approaches: C-14 partitioning approach and root trenching. The variable habitats encompassed peat and mineral soils, bare and vegetated surfaces and included both dry and moist ones. The field experiment was complemented by laboratory studies to measure bioavailability of soil carbon and identify sources of CO2. Differences in bioavailability of soils, measured in the laboratory as basal soil respiration rates, were generally greater than inter-site differences in SMR rates measured in situ, suggesting secondary constraints at field conditions, such as soil C content. There was a tendency towards lower SMR in vegetated peat plateaus compared to upland mineral tundra (on average 137 vs. 185 g CO2 m(-2) growing season(-1), respectively), but no significant differences were found. Surprisingly, the bare surfaces (peat circles) with 3500-year-old C at the surface exhibited about the largest SMR among all sites as shown by both methods. This was related to the general development of peat plateaus in the region, and uplifting of deeper peat with high C content to the surface during the genesis of peat circles. This observation is particularly relevant for decomposition of deeper peat in vegetated peat plateaus, where soil material similar to the bare surfaces can be found. The data indicate that the large stocks of C stored in permafrost peatlands are principally available for decomposition despite old age.

AB Understanding stream carbon export dynamics is needed to accurately predict how the carbon balance of peatland catchments will respond to climatic and environmental change. We used a 12year record (2003-2014) of continuous streamflow and manual spot measurements of total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane (CH4), and organic carbon quality (carbon-specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm per dissolved organic carbon) to assess interannual and seasonal variability in stream carbon export for a peatland catchment (70% mire and 30% forest cover) in northern Sweden. Mean annual total carbon export for the 12year period was 12.2 gCm(-2) yr(-1), but individual years ranged between 6 and 18 gCm(-2) yr(-1). TOC, which was primarily composed of dissolved organic carbon (>99%), was the dominant form of carbon being exported, comprising 63% to 79% of total annual exports, and DIC contributed between 19% and 33%. CH4 made up less than 5% of total export. When compared to previously published annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for the studied peatland system, stream carbon export typically accounted for 12 to 50% of NEE for most years. However, in 2006 stream carbon export accounted for 63 to 90% (estimated uncertainty range) of NEE due to a dry summer which suppressed NEE, followed by a wet autumn that resulted in considerable stream export. Runoff exerted a primary control on stream carbon export from this catchment; however, our findings suggest that seasonal variations in biologic and hydrologic processes responsible for production and transport of carbon within the peatland were secondary influences on stream carbon export. Consideration of these seasonal dynamics is needed when predicting stream carbon export response to environmental change.

AB Peatlands store large amounts of terrestrial carbon and any changes to their carbon balance could cause large changes in the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of the Earth's atmosphere. There is still much uncertainty about how the GHG dynamics of peatlands are affected by climate and land use change. Current field-based methods of estimating annual carbon exchange between peatlands and the atmosphere include flux chambers and eddy covariance towers. However, remote sensing has several advantages over these traditional approaches in terms of cost, spatial coverage and accessibility to remote locations. In this paper, we outline the basic principles of using remote sensing to estimate ecosystem carbon fluxes and explain the range of satellite data available for such estimations, considering the indices and models developed to make use of the data. Past studies, which have used remote sensing data in comparison with ground-based calculations of carbon fluxes over Northern peatland landscapes, are discussed, as well as the challenges of working with remote sensing on peatlands. Finally, we suggest areas in need of future work on this topic. We conclude that the application of remote sensing to models of carbon fluxes is a viable research method over Northern peatlands but further work is needed to develop more comprehensive carbon cycle models and to improve the long-term reliability of models, particularly on peatland sites undergoing restoration.

AB Lakes and wetlands, common ecosystems of the high northern latitudes, exchange large amounts of the climate-forcing gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. The magnitudes of these fluxes and the processes driving them are still uncertain, particularly for subarctic and Arctic lakes where direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 emissions are often of low temporal resolution and are rarely sustained throughout the entire year.
   Using the eddy covariance method, we measured surface-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2 during 2.5 years in a thawed fen and a shallow lake of a subarctic peatland complex. Gas exchange at the fen exhibited the expected seasonality of a subarctic wetland with maximum CH4 emissions and CO2 uptake in summer, as well as low but continuous emissions of CH4 and CO2 throughout the snow-covered winter. The seasonality of lake fluxes differed, with maximum CO2 and CH4 flux rates recorded at spring thaw. During the ice-free seasons, we could identify surface CH4 emissions as mostly ebullition events with a seasonal trend in the magnitude of the release, while a net CO2 flux indicated photosynthetic activity. We found correlations between surface CH4 emissions and surface sediment temperature, as well as between diel CO2 uptake and diel solar input. During spring, the breakdown of thermal stratification following ice thaw triggered the degassing of both CH4 and CO2. This spring burst was observed in 2 consecutive years for both gases, with a large inter-annual variability in the magnitude of the CH4 degassing.
   On the annual scale, spring emissions converted the lake from a small CO2 sink to a CO2 source: 80% of total annual carbon emissions from the lake were emitted as CO2. The annual total carbon exchange per unit area was highest at the fen, which was an annual sink of carbon with respect to the atmosphere. Continuous respiration during the winter partly counteracted the fen summer sink by accounting for, as both CH4 and CO2, 33% of annual carbon exchange. Our study shows (1) the importance of overturn periods (spring or fall) for the annual CH4 and CO2 emissions of northern lakes, (2) the significance of lakes as atmospheric carbon sources in subarctic landscapes while fens can be a strong carbon sink, and (3) the potential for ecosystem-scale eddy covariance measurements to improve the understanding of short-term processes driving lake-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2.

AB Responses of near-surface permafrost and glacial ice to climate change are of particular significance for understanding long-term effects on global carbon cycling and carbon export by high-latitude northern rivers. Here we report 14C-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) values and dissolved organic matter optical data for the Yukon River, 15 tributaries of the Yukon River, glacial meltwater, and groundwater and soil water end-member sources draining to the Yukon River, with the goal of assessing mobilization of aged DOC within the watershed. Ancient DOC was associated with glacial meltwater and groundwater sources. In contrast, DOC from watersheds dominated by peat soils and underlain by permafrost was typically enriched in 14C indicating that degradation of ancient carbon stores is currently not occurring at large enough scales to quantitatively influence bulk DOC exports from those landscapes. On an annual basis, DOC exported was predominantly modern during the spring period throughout the Yukon River basin and became older through summer-fall and winter periods, suggesting that contributions of older DOC from soils, glacial meltwaters, and groundwater are significant during these months. Our data indicate that rapidly receding glaciers and increasing groundwater inputs will likely result in greater contributions of older DOC in the Yukon River and its tributaries in coming decades.

AB A three-dimensional model, based on numerous vertical and horizontal C-14 datings and GIS simulation from a concentrically domed mire in southern Finland, demonstrates considerable variation in actual (net) rate of carbon accumulation (ARCA) through time. Lateral growth between 9000 and 3000 yr ago accounts for only 25% of the total carbon sequestration, whereas bog formation after ombrotrophication is responsible for the remaining 75%. On the other hand, the most rapid increase in landscape CH4 fur occurred between 4500 and 3000 yr ago, the period of the fastest horizontal growth. In addition to autecological factors, a climatic shift towards cooler and wetter conditions is a plausible mechanism for maintaining accelerated carbon accumulation.

AB Microfungi were isolated from living and decomposing Sphagnum fuscum from a southern boreal bog in Alberta, Canada. Fifty-five fungi (three ascomycetes. three basidiomycetes, 11 zygomycetes, 28 Fungi Imperfecti, 10 unnamed mycelia sterilia) are described in this study. Of the Fungi Imperfecti, 21 species have known sexual states (teleomorph) in the Ascomycota, while the remaining seven species are known only from their asexual state (anamorph) and could not be assigned to specific teleomorphic families. Thirty-six species represent new records from Sphagnum and 45 species are new records for S. fuscum. Nearly, 52% of the 45 identified fungi originated from three families, Mortierellaceae (10 taxa, Zygomycota), Trichocomaceae (8 taxa, Ascomycota), and Hypocreaceae (5 taxa, Ascomycota), with the remaining fungi representing 12 additional families. The 55 fungi have the ability, to utilize a variety of carbon sources, such as cellulose, tannic acid. and pectin, and thus are important organisms involved the mineralization of carbon in peatlands.

AB The fluvial fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peatlands form an important part of that ecosystem's carbon cycle, contributing approximately 35% of the overall peatland carbon budget. The in-stream processes acting on the DOC, such as photodegradation and biodegradation, can lead to DOC loss and thus contribute CO2 to the atmosphere. The aim of this study was to understand what controls the rates of DOC degradation. Water samples from a headwater, peat-covered catchment, were collected over a 23month period and analyzed for the DOC degradation rate and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in the context of hydroclimatic monitoring. Measures of DOM composition included C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, and elemental analysis. Regression analysis showed that there was a significant role for the composition of the DOM in controlling degradation with degradation rates significantly increasing with the proportion of aldehyde and carboxylic acid functional groups but decreasing with the proportion of N-alkyl functional groups. The highest rates of DOC degradation occurred when aldehyde functionality was at its greatest and this occurred on the recession limb of storm hydrographs. Including this knowledge into models of fluvial carbon fate for an 818km(2) catchment gave an annual average DOC removal rate of 67% and 50% for total organic carbon, slightly lower than previously predicted. The compositional controls suggest that DOM is primarily being used as a ready energy source to the aquatic ecosystem rather than as a nutrient source.

AB The future status of peatlands as carbon stores/sinks is uncertain given current and predicted environmental change. Several factors can affect the magnitude of the peatland carbon sink including disturbances such as wildfire. There is at present little evidence of how wildfire affects the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) via perturbation to aerobic and anaerobic respiration. The greatest effects, which are likely to vary according to wildfire severity, would be expected in the immediate post-fire stages when little recovery has taken place. Here, we investigate five UK peatland wildfires (2011-2012) in the immediate post-wildfire period measuring CO(2)and CH(4)fluxes using static chambers. Fire severity was described using a modified form of the composite burn index. A hierarchical partitioning approach indicated time since fire was the most strongly associated variable that fluxes of both CO2, and CH(4)followed by soil temperature for CO(2)and fire severity for CH4. Using a liner mixed modelling approach to account for repeated measures; fire severity was a significant term for CH(4)and borderline significant for CO2. Mean fluxes of CH(4)were consistently lower on burnt sites. In contrast, data from a fire in the north of Scotland appeared to show the opposite relationship for CH(4)with higher fluxes on the burnt sites. These results suggest that wildfire can affect gaseous carbon fluxes, but the responses can be variable in both space and time and that disruption to anaerobic processes may be site and/or fire dependent.

AB Here, we present results of Holocene carbon accumulation from seven new peat cores at four fen sites from Alberta, western Canada. Along with two other published fen records in the same region, we provide a regional synthesis of carbon accumulation patterns, as well as peat property data in this continental climate. On the basis of >3000 peat sample measurements at 1-cm intervals, organic matter content in peat samples is on average at 91.0% (+/- 9.3% in SD) and ash-free bulk density at 0.141 g/cm(3) (+/- 0.045 g/cm(3) in SD) with a range of 0.018-0.381 g/cm(3). On the basis of 109 radiocarbon age determinations from these cores, the overall mean carbon accumulation rate at these fens since 9 kyr (1 kyr = 1000 cal. yr BP) is 32.5 g C/m(2)/yr, which is much higher than the northern peatland average of 18.6-22.9 g C/m(2)/yr from large-scale syntheses. The 'instantaneous' apparent carbon accumulation rates from all these individual measurements at mostly 1-cm intervals are highly variable throughout the Holocene, ranging from 6 to 504 g C/m(2)/yr. The carbon accumulation rates appear to show peak values at 8.3, 6.8, 5.3, 3.8, 2.7, and 1.1 kyr, suggesting a similar to 1500-year periodicity in carbon accumulation, possibly in response to Holocene climate change. Furthermore, carbon accumulation shows a gradual declining trend from 7 to 2 kyr, reaching a minimum at 2 kyr, likely in response to neoglacial climate cooling during the later part of the Holocene in the high-latitude regions. Overall, these fens accumulated and store on average 264 kg C/m(2) during the Holocene, among the highest soil carbon storage reported from terrestrial ecosystems. Our results, along with previous global and regional syntheses, suggest that in contrast to conventional wisdom, fens in continental climates accumulate peat at similar or greater rates than do bogs in oceanic climates.

AB The largest terrestrial-to-atmosphere carbon flux is respired CO2. However, the partitioning of soil and plant sources, understanding of contributory mechanisms, and their response to climate change are uncertain. A plant removal experiment was established within a peatland located in the UK uplands to quantify respiration derived from recently-fixed plant carbon and that derived from decomposition of soil organic matter, using natural abundance C-13 and bomb-C-14 as tracers. Soil and plant respiration sources were found respectively to contribute similar to 36% and between 41 and 54% of the total ecosystem CO2 flux. Respired CO2 produced in the clipped ('soil') plots had a mean age of similar to 15 years since fixation from the atmosphere, whereas the C-14 content of ecosystem CO2 was statistically indistinguishable from the contemporary atmosphere. Results of carbon mass balance modelling showed that, in addition to respiration from bulk soil and plant respired CO2, a third, much older source of CO2 existed. This source, which we suggest is CO2 derived from the catotelm constituted between similar to 10 and 23% of total ecosystem respiration and had a mean radiocarbon age of between several hundred and similar to 2000 years before present (BP). These findings show that plant-mediated transport of CO2 produced in the catotelm may form a considerable component of peatland ecosystem respiration. The implication of this discovery is that current assumptions in terrestrial carbon models need to be re-evaluated to consider the climate sensitivity of this third source of peatland CO2.

AB Peatlands and forested wetlands can cover a large fraction of the land area and contain a majority of the regional carbon pool in wet northern temperate landscapes. We used the LANDIS-II forest landscape succession model coupled with a model of plant community and soil carbon responses to water table changes to explore the impacts of declining water table on regional carbon pools in a peatland- and wetland-rich landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA. Simulations indicated that both biomass accumulation and soil decomposition would increase as a consequence of drying. In peatlands, simulated water table declines of 100 cm led to large increases in biomass as well as short-term increases in soil carbon, whereas declines of 40 cm led to continuous declines in soil carbon and smaller increases in biomass, with the net result being a loss of total carbon. In non-peat wetlands, biomass accumulation outweighed soil carbon loss for both scenarios. Long-term carbon cycle responses were not significantly affected by the time scale of water table decline. In general, peatland carbon storage over the first 50-150 years following drainage was neutral or increasing due to increased plant growth, whereas carbon storage over longer time scales decreased due to soil carbon loss. Although the simplicity of the model limits quantitative interpretation, the results show that plant community responses are essential to understanding the full impact of hydrological change on carbon storage in peatland-rich landscapes, and that measurements over long time scales are necessary to adequately constrain landscape carbon pool responses to declining water table.

AB Recent warming at high-latitudes has accelerated permafrost thaw in northern peatlands, and thaw can have profound effects on local hydrology and ecosystem carbon balance. To assess the impact of permafrost thaw on soil organic carbon (OC) dynamics, we measured soil hydrologic and thermal dynamics and soil OC stocks across a collapse-scar bog chronosequence in interior Alaska. We observed dramatic changes in the distribution of soil water associated with thawing of ice-rich frozen peat. The impoundment of warm water in collapse-scar bogs initiated talik formation and the lateral expansion of bogs over time. On average, Permafrost Plateaus stored 137 +/- 37 kg C m(-2), whereas OC storage in Young Bogs and Old Bogs averaged 84 +/- 13 kg C m(-2). Based on our reconstructions, the accumulation of OC in near-surface bog peat continued for nearly 1,000 years following permafrost thaw, at which point accumulation rates slowed. Rapid decomposition of thawed forest peat reduced deep OC stocks by nearly half during the first 100 years following thaw. Using a simple mass-balance model, we show that accumulation rates at the bog surface were not sufficient to balance deep OC losses, resulting inanet loss of OC from the entire peat column. An uncertainty analysis also revealed that the magnitude and timing of soil OC loss from thawed forest peat depends substantially on variation in OC input rates to bog peat and variation in decay constants for shallow and deep OC stocks. These findings suggest that permafrost thaw and the subsequent release of OC from thawed peat will likely reduce the strength of northern permafrost-affected peatlands as a carbon dioxide sink, and consequently, will likely accelerate rates of atmospheric warming.

A total of 224 observations from 22 stands in upland forests and 195 observations from 14 different studies in peatland forests were utilized for the present analyses. The relationships between biomass and percentage cover can be used in ecosystem and carbon-cycle modelling as a rapid nondestructive method for estimation of the aboveground biomass of lichens, bryophytes, herbs and grasses, and dwarf shrubs in upland forests and bottom and field layers in peatland forests.

AB To test the effects of altered hydrology on organic soil decomposition, we investigated CO2 and CH4 production potential of rich-fen peat (mean surface pH = 6.3) collected from a field water table manipulation experiment including control, raised and lowered water table treatments. Mean anaerobic CO2 production potential at 10 cm depth (14.1 +/- 0.9 mu mol C g(-1) d(-1)) was as high as aerobic CO2 production potential (10.6 +/- 1.5 mu mol C g(-1) d(-1)), while CH4 production was low (mean of 7.8 +/- 1.5 nmol C g(-1) d(-1)). Denitrification enzyme activity indicated a very high denitrification potential (197 +/- 23 mu g N g(-1) d(-1)), but net NO3- reduction suggested this was a relatively minor pathway for anaerobic CO2 production. Abundances of denitrifier genes (nirK and nosZ) did not change across water table treatments. SO42- reduction also did not appear to be an important pathway for anaerobic CO2 production. The net accumulation of acetate and formate as decomposition end products in the raised water table treatment suggested that fermentation was a significant pathway for carbon mineralization, even in the presence of NOT. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were the strongest predictors of potential anaerobic and aerobic CO2 production. Across all water table treatments, the CO2:CH4 ratio increased with initial DOC leachate concentrations. While the field water table treatment did not have a significant effect on mean CO2 or CH4 production potential, the CO2:CH4 ratio was highest in shallow peat incubations from the drained treatment. These data suggest that with continued drying or with a more variable water table, anaerobic CO2 production may be favored over CH4 production in this rich fen. Future research examining the potential for dissolved organic substances to facilitate anaerobic respiration, or alternative redox processes that limit the effectiveness of organic acids as substrates in anaerobic metabolism, would help explain additional uncertainty concerning carbon mineralization in this system.

AB Fire in wetlands is poorly understood, yet hazard reduction burns are a common management practice and bushfires are becoming increasingly prevalent because of climate change. Fire may have long-lasting implications for the microbial component of these wetland ecosystems that regulate carbon and nutrient cycling. The extremely fire-prone Blue Mountains World Heritage Area in south-eastern Australia contains hundreds of endangered peat-forming upland swamps that regularly experience both bushfires and hazard reduction burns. In a before-after control--impact study, we surveyed the sediment microbial community of these swamps to test the impact of a low-intensity hazard reduction burn. Along with sediment pH, moisture and organic content, we measured gene abundances including those relating to carbon cycling (quantitative PCR (qPCR) ofpmoA,mcrA, bacterial 16S rRNA and archaeal 16S rRNA), and bacteria community fingerprint (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP)). One year after the hazard reduction burn, there were no significant differences in the gene abundances or microbial community fingerprint that could be attributed to the fire, suggesting that the hazard reduction burn did not have a long-term impact on these microbial communities.

AB Few studies have quantified the role of in-stream processes on net dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively) export from peatland catchments, and those that have offer conflicting evidence. In this study, we evaluated evidence for active organic matter processing under field conditions, via a coordinated campaign across four UK catchments with peatland headwaters, targeted on potential 'hotspots' and 'hot moments' of physico-chemical carbon cycling. We hypothesised that specific hotspots and hot moments would occur where waters enriched with DOC and POC sourced from headwaters are exposed to: (1) mixing with freshwaters of different pH, conductivity and metal concentrations; and (2) mixing with seawater during autumn when DOC concentrations were at their highest. We observed instances of POC removal in headwaters, and potential for rapid conversion between dissolved and particulate carbon forms and for net removal of peat-derived carbon at confluences further downstream (where observed, on the order of 52-75 % for POC, and 5-44 % for DOC). Estuary transect surveys indicated that up to 30 % of fluvial DOC can be removed under high flow conditions. However, in the majority of cases concentrations remained within the range that would be expected based on conservative transport. These findings indicate that rapid (e.g. solubility-related) processes within the river system may be important but sporadic, thus are unlikely to provide major removal pathways for peat-derived organic carbon.

AB Peatlands in northern permafrost regions store a significant proportion of global soil carbon. Recent warming is accelerating peatland permafrost thaw and thermokarst collapse, exposing previously frozen peat to microbial decomposition and potential mineralization into greenhouse gases. Here, we show from a site in the sporadic-discontinuous permafrost zone of western Canada that thermokarst collapse leads to neither large losses nor gains following thaw, as deep carbon losses are offset by surficial accumulation. We collected peat cores along two thaw chronosequences, from peat plateau, through young (30 years since thaw), intermediate (70 years), and mature (200 years) thermokarst bog locations. Macrofossil and C-14 analysis showed synchronicity of peatland development until recent thaw, with wetland initiation 8,500 cal yr BP followed by succession through peatland stages prior to permafrost aggradation 1,800 cal yr BP. Analysis and modeling of soil carbon stocks indicated 8.7 +/- 12.4 kg C m(-2) of carbon accumulated prior to thaw was lost in 200 years post-thaw. Despite these losses, there was no observed increase in peat humification as assessed by Fourier transform infrared and C:N ratios. Rapid peat accumulation post-thaw (9.8 +/- 1.6 kg C m(-2) over 200 years) offset deeper losses. Our approach constrains the net carbon balance to be between uptake of 27.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and loss of 106.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over 200 years post-thaw. While our approach cannot determine whether thermokarst bogs in the sporadic-discontinuous permafrost zone act as long-term carbon sinks or sources post-thaw, our study better constrains post-thaw C losses and gains.
   Plain Language Summary Northern peatlands store a third of the world's soil carbon, a store which has slowly accumulated over the last 10,000 years. A large amount of this soil carbon has become frozen in permafrost peatlands, but warming is causing these stores to thaw. Permafrost thaw in peatlands not only leads to potential decomposition of previously frozen peat but also leads to increased growth of mosses at the surface. Increased decomposition of previously frozen peat can release formerly trapped carbon into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases, thus accelerating ongoing climate warming, while increased moss growth would increase carbon storage. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of thawing on peatland carbon storage. To do this, we measured the amount of previously frozen permafrost carbon that was lost following thaw and compared it to the amount that accumulated at the surface. We found no long-term net impact of permafrost thaw on carbon stores, as losses of previously frozen carbon were offset by carbon that accumulated at the surface following thaw. Our results rule out both large rapid losses and large gains of carbon following thaw in peatlands, which greatly help to constrain projections of carbon cycling at high latitudes in a warming world.

AB Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) plays an important role in estimating the global carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems, and knowledge of respiration is required to correctly assess the gross primary (GPP) production of such ecosystems. In our paper, daytime R-eco fluxes are compared with nighttime CO2 fluxes which were measured manually by the closed chamber technique on a wetland site in Poland. The CO2 fluxes measurements were performed between July 2008 and May 2009. Our study indicated that there are significant differences between modeled daytime and nighttime R-eco fluxes and that these differences are higher when the nighttime fluxes are restricted only to nights with stable atmospheric conditions. The nighttime sums of cumulative R-eco are much higher than the one estimated for daytime conditions, while there is nearly no difference between daytime and nighttime sums of cumulative R-eco, when the nighttime fluxes are restricted only for nights with turbulent atmospheric conditions. Consequently, R-eco models developed on the basis of nighttime data series can overestimate CO2 fluxes when they are used to estimate daytime respiration. In order to reduce uncertainties in estimation of daily R-eco fluxes on the basis of the nighttime chamber measurements, the nighttime R-eco models should be restriced only to the fluxes that were measured in turbulent atmospheric conditions. The biases in nighttime chamber measurements (especially when conducted in stable atmospheric conditions) as well as differences in estimated daytime and nighttime R-eco fluxes can have a significant effect on the assessment of global carbon balances of terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Aims Mycorrhizal type has been proposed as an effective trait integrator capturing varying biogeochemical syndromes in terrestrial ecosystems. However, for boreal peatlands, it is still unclear whether mycorrhizal associations of vascular plants can indicate leaf nutrient resorption patterns and litter decomposition rates. Methods We determined leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) resorption efficiency and proficiency of 11 common vascular plants belonging to three mycorrhizal types (ectomycorrhizal, ECM; ericoid mycorrhizal, ERM; and non-mycorrhizal, NM) in boreal peatlands of Northeast China, and measured leaf litter mass loss and N remaining of these 11 species after one and 3 years of decomposition using the litterbag method. Results Leaf nutrient resorption and litter decomposition rates varied significantly among the three mycorrhizal types. Specifically, ECM plants had greater green leaf nutrient (N and P) concentrations and lower leaf nutrient resorption efficiency and proficiency than ERM and NM plants. Moreover, ECM plants had higher leaf litter mass loss and lower N remaining than ERM and NM plants after one and 3 years of decomposition, respetively. In addition, both leaf litter mass loss and N remaining significantly correlated with N and P resorption efficiency and proficiency, indicating that plant nutrient resorption and litter decomposition were coupled. Conclusions These results suggest that leaf nutrient resorption and litter decomposition are tightly linked to the mycorrhizal associations of vascular plants, and highlight that mycorrhizal type can be applied to explain and predict the dynamics of plant-mediated carbon and nutrient cycles in boreal peatlands.

AB Thawing of permafrost and subsequent release of organic carbon in the warming Arctic has great potential to influence carbon cycling between the land and ocean. Here, we investigated temporal and spatial differences of organic carbon sources in sediments of Colville River delta and the adjacent Simpson Lagoon, Alaska (USA) over the last similar to 50 years, using a multi-proxy approach (lignin, fatty acids, sterols, bulk and compound-specific C-13 isotopes). Stations closer to the river mouth showed greater inputs of soil and litter-derived terrestrial material based on the terrestrial inputs indicator (Lambda(8)), soil biomarker (3,5-Bd), and degradation index ([Ad/Al](v)), as well as stronger and more frequent watershed-flushing events, coupled with Colville River discharge events, than stations in the lagoon. Values of Lambda(8), 3,5-Bd, and [Ad/Al](v) in sediments ranged from 0.75-2.69, 0.02-0.44 mg/ 100 mg OC, and 0.23-0.85, respectively. The increase of terrestrial inputs in sediments near the delta for the last similar to 50 years is most likely due to increase of river discharge under warmer temperatures in recent decades. Coastal erosion and inputs from other river sources (e.g., Kuparuk and Mackenzie Rivers) also contribute to the organic carbon in sediments of the delta. Rudimentary fatty acid indices reflected two distinct groups of bacteria in these sediments. Additionally, the sterol biomarker 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3 beta-ol is useful to track peat inputs in the Arctic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and methane (CH4) flux were measured by chamber measurements for five distinct ecotypes (areas with unique eco-hydrological characteristics) at Abbeyleix Bog in the Irish midlands over a 2-year period. The ecotypes ranged from those with high-quality peat-forming vegetation to communities indicative of degraded, drained conditions. Three of these ecotypes were located in an area where peat was extracted by hand and then abandoned and left to revegetate naturally at least 50 years prior to the start of the study. Two of the ecotypes were located on an adjacent raised bog, which although never mined for peat, was impacted by shallow drainage and then restored (by drain blocking) 6 years prior to the start of the study. Other major aspects of the carbon (C) balance, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and open-water CO2 evasion, were quantified for a catchment area at the study site over the same 2-year period. The ecotype average annual ecotype C balance ranged from a net C sink of -58 +/- 60 gCm(-2) yr(-1), comparable to studies of intact peatlands, to a substantial C source of C +205 +/- 80 gC m(-2) yr(-1), with NEE being the most variable component of the C balance among the five ecotypes. Ecotype annual CH4 flux ranged from 2.7 +/- 1.4 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) to 14.2 +/- 4.8 g C-CH4 m(-2)yr(-1). Average annual aquatic C losses were 14.4 gCm(-2) yr(-1) with DOC, DIC, and CO2 evasion of 10.4 g Cm(-2)yr(-1), 1.3 g Cm-2 yr(-1), and 2.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1), respectively. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the mean annual water table (MAWT) and the plot-scale NEE but not the global warming potential (GWP). However, a significant negative correlation was observed between the plot-scale percentage of Sphagnum moss cover and the GWP, highlighting the importance of regenerating this keystone genus as a climate change mitigation strategy in peatland restoration. The data from this study were then compared to the rapidly growing number of peatland C balance studies across boreal and temperate regions. The trend in NEE and CH4 flux with respect to MAWT was compared for the five ecotypes in this study and literature data from degraded/restored/recovering peatlands, intact peatlands, and bare peat sites.

TI AFRICA AS SOURCE AND SINK FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE

AB Comparison of a set of paleogeographic maps of Africa for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO) allows us to discuss the contribution of paleocontinental proxy-data in paleobiomass calculations and their accuracy.
   Maps show considerable shifts in the area covered by the main ecosystems. In this study we have quantified these areal changes, from the LGM to the HCO, in terms of variations in carbon storage. Each biome has been assigned a carbon density in living and soil organic matter. From desert to tropical forest the mean carbon densities vary from 0 to 20 kg m-2 for phytomass and from 0 to 13 kg m-2 for soil (peat excluded). During the world deglaciation Africa was a sink for 154 Gt (standard deviation 42 Gt) of atmospheric carbon. Since the HCO Africa has been a source of carbon. More recently human deforestation is responsible for a carbon flux towards the atmosphere which is ten times the mean annual flux due to vegetation change in response to climate change.
   Extended to a global scale this regional test shows that the paleoenvironmental approach is more appropriate for paleobiomass estimates than calculations based only on oceanic data.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems in the global carbon cycle, serving as both the largest terrestrial soil carbon pool and a significant source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). In Sphagnum moss-dominated wetlands, anaerobic decomposition, and in particular the production of CH4, is highly variable and controlling factors are poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to determine if leachates of Sphagnum can explain differences in anaerobic decomposition and CH4 production from three Sphagnum-dominated peatlands.
   Soils from each peatland were incubated anaerobically for 40 days with Sphagnum-derived organic matter (S-DOM) extracted using distilled water at 25 or 60 degrees C in a fully-crossed experimental design. S-DOM extracted at 25 degrees C had a minimal effect on decomposition, but S-DOM extracted at 60 degrees C increased CO2 production in all soils. The magnitude of the increased CO2 production in response to S-DOM depended on the source site of the S-DOM. The response of CH4 production to additions of S-DOM extracted at 60 degrees C was more complex. Soils from one peatland produced no CH4 during the incubation, regardless of S-DOM source. The same S-DOM additions led to an increase in CH4 production in a second soil, but a decrease in CH4 production in the third soil. Stable isotopic evidence suggests that these patterns were driven by the selective inhibition or stimulation of acetoclastic methanogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest S-DOM alone does not explain differences in anaerobic decomposition in peatlands, but may play a role in regulating CO2 and CH4 production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent studies have suggested that the marine contribution of methane from shallow regions and melting marine-terminating glaciers may have been underestimated. Here we report on methane sources and potential sinks associated with methane seeps in Cumberland Bay, South Georgia's largest fjord system. The average organic carbon content in the upper 8 m of the sediment is around 0.65 wt %; this observation combined with Parasound data suggest that the methane gas accumulations probably originate from peat-bearing sediments currently located several tens of meters below the seafloor. Only one of our cores indicates upward advection; instead most of the methane is transported via diffusion. Sulfate and methane flux estimates indicate that a large fraction of methane is consumed by anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Carbon cycling at the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) results in a marked fractionation of the delta C-13-CH4 from an estimated source value of -65 parts per thousand to a value as low as -96 parts per thousand just below the SMT. Methane concentrations in sediments are high, especially close to the seepage sites (similar to 40 mM); however, concentrations in the water column are relatively low (max. 58 nM) and can be observed only close to the seafloor. Methane is trapped in the lowermost water mass; however, measured microbial oxidation rates reveal very low activity with an average turnover of 3.1 years. We therefore infer that methane must be transported out of the bay in the bottom water layer. A mean sea-air flux of only 0.005 nM/m(2) s confirms that almost no methane reaches the atmosphere.

AB The reconstruction of the stable carbon isotope evolution in atmospheric CO2 (delta C-13(atm)), as archived in Antarctic ice cores, bears the potential to disentangle the contributions of the different carbon cycle fluxes causing past CO2 variations. Here we present a new record of delta C-13(atm) before, during and after the Marine Isotope Stage 5.5 (155 000 to 105 000 yr BP). The dataset is archived on the data repository PANGEA (R) (www.pangea.de) under doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.817041. The record was derived with a well established sublimation method using ice from the EPICA Dome C (EDC) and the Talos Dome ice cores in East Antarctica. We find a 0.4 parts per thousand shift to heavier values between the mean delta C-13(atm) level in the Penultimate (similar to 140 000 yr BP) and Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 22 000 yr BP), which can be explained by either (i) changes in the isotopic composition or (ii) intensity of the carbon input fluxes to the combined ocean/atmosphere carbon reservoir or (iii) by long-term peat buildup. Our isotopic data suggest that the carbon cycle evolution along Termination II and the subsequent interglacial was controlled by essentially the same processes as during the last 24 000 yr, but with different phasing and magnitudes. Furthermore, a 5000 yr lag in the CO2 decline relative to EDC temperatures is confirmed during the glacial inception at the end of MIS5.5 (120 000 yr BP). Based on our isotopic data this lag can be explained by terrestrial carbon release and carbonate compensation.

AB Extreme global warmth and an abrupt negative carbon isotope excursion during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) have been attributed to a massive release of methane hydrate from sediments on the continental slope [G.R. Dickens, J.R. O'Neil, D.K. Rea, R.M. Owen, Dissociation of oceanic methane hydrate as a cause of the carbon isotope excursion at the end of the Paleocene, Paleoceanography 10 (1995) 965-971.]. However, the magnitude of the warming (5 to 6 degrees C [J.C. Zachos, M.W. Wara, S. Bohaty, M.L. Delaney, M.R. Petrizzo, A. Brill, T.J. Bralower, I. Premoli-Silva, A transient rise in tropical sea surface temperature during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, Science 302 (2003) 1551-1554.,J.P. Kennett, L.D. Stott, Abrupt deep-sea warming, paleoceanographic changes and benthic extinctions at the end of the Paleocene, Nature 353 (1991) 225-228.]) and rise in the depth of the CCD (> 2 km; [J.C. Zachos, U. Rohl, S.A. Schellenberg, D. Hodell, E. Thomas, A. Sluijs, C. Kelly, H. McCarren, D. Kroon, I. Raffi, L.J. Lourens, M. Nicolo, Rapid acidification of the ocean during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, Science 308 (2005) 1611-1615.]) indicate that the size of the carbon addition was larger than can be accounted for by the methane hydrate hypothesis. Additional carbon sources associated with methane hydrate release (e.g. pore-water venting and turbidite oxidation) are also insufficient. We find that the oxidation of at least 5000 Gt C of organic carbon is the most likely explanation for the observed geochemical and climatic changes during the PETM, for which there are several potential mechanisms. Production of thermogenic CH4 and CO2 during contact metamorphism associated with the intrusion of a large igneous province into organic rich sediments [H. Svensen, S. Planke, A. Malthe-Sorenssen, B. Jamtveit, R. Myklebust, T.R. Eidem, S.S. Rey, Release of methane from a volcanic basin as a mechanism for initial Eocene global warming, Nature 429 (2004).] is capable of supplying large amounts of carbon, but is inconsistent with the lack of extensive carbon loss in metamorphosed sediments, as well as the abrupt onset and termination of carbon release during the PETM. A global conflagration of Paleocene peatlands [A.C. Kurtz, L.R. Kump, M.A. Arthur, J.C. Zachos, A. Paytan, Early Cenozoic decoupling of the global carbon and sulfur cycles, Paleoceanography 18 (2003).] highlights a large terrestrial carbon source, but massive carbon release by fire seems unlikely as it would require that all peatlands burn at once and then for only 10 to 30 ky. In addition, this hypothesis requires an order of magnitude increase in the amount of carbon stored in peat. The isolation of a large epicontinental seaway by tectonic uplift associated with volcanism or continental collision, followed by desiccation and bacterial respiration of the aerated organic matter is another potential mechanism for the rapid release of large amounts Of CO2. In addition to the oxidation of the underlying marine sediments, the desiccation of a major epicontinental seaway would remove a large source of moisture for the continental interior, resulting in the desiccation and bacterial oxidation of adjacent terrestrial wetlands.

AB The vast undisturbed mires in western Siberia formed a significant sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide during the Holocene. However, the lack of spatially resolved simulation models hampers the quantification of Holocene carbon accumulation of the entire mire systems. Here we developed a three-dimensional dynamic model, based on a hydrological approach. We applied the model to a large mire complex in western Siberia to simulate its Holocene development and to quantify the long-term carbon accumulation rate (LORCA). Our model simulated a LORCA with a spatial variation of 10-85 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The average over the Holocene was 16.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Simulation scenarios for the 21st century show that the average LORCA dropped to 5.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) because of oxidation and decomposition of peat following mire drainage after the 1950s. Even in the undrained parts of the mire complex the LORCA is lowered substantially because of the dropped water table and resulting decrease in peat growth. Our results show that carbon accumulation in western Siberian watershed mires will continue in the future. Thus these mires might remain a significant sink of carbon.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the contribution of drained organic forestlands in Sweden to the national greenhouse gas budget. Drained organic forestland in Sweden collectively comprises an estimated net sink for greenhouse gases of -5.0 Mt carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents year(-1) ( range -12.0 to 1.2) when default emission factors provided by the Good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry are used, and an estimated net source of 0.8 Mt CO2 equivalents year(-1) ( range -6.7 to 5.1) when available emission data for the climatic zones spanned by Sweden are used. This discrepancy is mainly due to differences in the emission factors for heterotrophic respiration. The main uncertainties in the estimates are related to carbon changes in the litter pool and releases of soil CO2 and nitrous oxide.

AB Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was studied in a bog located in the middle taiga of Siberia using two approaches, the accumulation of peat above the hypocotyl of pine trees, and the eddy covariance flux methodology. NEP was 0.84 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) using the peat accumulation method; it was 0.43-0.62 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) using eddy covariance over three growing seasons. These data were compared with NEP of the surrounding forest, which was 0.6 tC +/- 1.1 hat yr(-1). The trees growing on the bog reached a total height of about 3 m and an age of 80-120 yr when peat accumulation reached 0.5-0.6 m. At that stage the growth rate of the oldest trees declined. This indicates that there is a maximum age that can be reached by trees growing on hummocks (<150 yr), depending on conditions. The data show that the determination of NEP in bogs by using the peat accumulation above the hypocotyl is a useful method which can be applied on a wide range of bog types, but it may systematically overestimate NEP. The total sink capacity for carbon assimilation of bogs is comparable to that of forest, although methane emissions and losses of dissolved organic carbon must be taken into account when assessing the regional carbon cycle.

AB Our understanding of the hydrodynamic response of peatland to climate change is restricted to the Holocene, which confines our knowledge of the fundamental controls on this important carbon reservoir to recent sedimentary successions. To understand the interaction of peatland hydrodynamics, climate and the carbon cycle on longer time scales, a 95.4 in record from lower Miocene lignite from the Gippsland Basin, Australia is considered. delta C-13 and colour records for the lignite were created by analysing samples every 0.1 in. Solid-state C-13 NMR results indicate that lignite colour is related to the relative abundance of aliphatic carbon. The lack of a direct correlation between colour and delta C-13 demonstrates that the delta C-13 signal has not been significantly influenced by the diagenetic processes that produce the colour. An offset correlation occurs between delta C-13 and colour with the degree of offset decreasing from 4.5 m at the base to about 0 in at the top. This offset is considered to represent a zone of surface influence that extends up to 20 m below the peat surface. Using numerical modelling we demonstrate that this zone of surface influence and its gradual decline in thickness could arise as a consequence of enhanced fluid flow in regions of high tensile stress within the unconfined peat body. The removal of lignin and its derivatives from the zone of surface influence will be favoured by cooler drier periods. with lower sea level and high hydraulic gradients across the peatland. Therefore in the early Miocene this peatland acted as a carbon source during global cooling. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We measured water table levels, above- and below-ground plant production, and CO2 and CH4 emissions for five fens in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, to determine whether a water diversion project was adversely affecting carbon cycling. Two fens were located beneath the water diversion, and three fens were located in an adjacent pristine watershed. The diversion lowered water table levels in one fen, while the other fen was not hydrologically modified. Total NPP (net primary production) for all sites ranged from 130 to 316 g C.m(-2).year(-1), with a mean of 217 g C.m(-2).year(-1), and belowground NPP accounted for similar to60% of the total. Maximum CO2 emissions for pristine fens ranged between 170 and 273 mg CO2-C.m(-2).h(-1), with annual emissions of 230-388 9 CO2-C.m(-2).year(-1). However, the hydrologically modified fen had maximum CO2 emissions of 457 mg CO2-C.m(-2).h(-1) and had an annual flux of 573 g CO2-C.m(-2).year(-1). Maximum CH4 emissions ranged from 3 to 25 mg CH4-C.m(-2).h(-1), with annual emissions of 9-61 g CH4-C.m(-2).year(-1). The water diversion structure lowered water tables, increased CO2, decreased CH4 and NPP, and resulted in the site likely becoming a net source of carbon.

AB The annual balance of CO2 was measured on a subarctic flark fen located in northern Finland (69degrees08'N, 27degrees17'E). Measurements were conducted using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method during the period from April 1998 to April 1999. Special emphasis was put on the importance of the wintertime CO2 balance as a component of the annual budget. The CO2 fluxes observed during the winter were relatively small (0.0055 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), but due to the long duration of the snow cover period, they play an important role in the annual balance of CO2. The efflux during the coldest periods, when soil surface temperatures fell below -10degreesC, was enabled by markedly higher peat temperatures (close to 0degreesC) in deeper layers. The typical nighttime respiration observed in summer was -0.10 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). The net photosynthesis had a typical daytime peak value of about -0.20 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in July. Corresponding with the instantaneous CO2 fluxes, the highest daily sink balances of about -9 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) were observed in July, while the highest daily respiration balances of about 2.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) were observed before and after the sink period. The CO2 balance for the winter period (105 g CO2 m(-2)) was greater than the absolute value of the total annual balance (-68 g CO2 m(-2)), which shows the importance of the wintertime efflux. After taking into account estimates for CH4 efflux and carbon leaching, an annual carbon balance of -7+/-5 g C m(-2) was obtained for the fen.

The sphagnum bog and one grass mire are in Poland, and the other grass mire is in Russia. As follows from the comparison, the common climatic and geochemical properties of location have effect on the chemical nature of phytomass. Grass mires have a higher content of nitrogen than sphagnum bogs. Both of the Polish bogs exhibit an increased content of K and a decreased content of Ca. The accumulation of P is characteristic of the Siberian grass mire and the accumulation of S is found in the Polish one.

AB Rewetting can strongly affect the matter balance of peatlands. Owing to evidence of increasing CH4 emissions and P mobilisation after rewetting, the effects of peatland restoration on climate, eutrophication risks and related controversies are discussed. Our study focuses on the role of helophytes in the carbon and nutrient balance of rewetted fen grasslands of NE Germany. We hypothesise that the helophytes Carex riparia, Glyceria maxima, Phalaris arundinacea, Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia differ in biomass production and nutrient standing stock according to site conditions and harvest time. We analysed the helophyte biomass three times a year and continuously measured water levels and quality. Biomass production, nutrient standing stock and litter accumulation were highly species specific and depended on nutrient availability, mean water levels and harvesting time. We conclude that helophytes store considerable amounts of carbon and temporarily improve the water quality by withdrawing high amounts of nutrients from the top soil during the growing season, and by reducing nutrient discharges. Restoring peatlands as effective nutrient and carbon sinks in the landscape should favour highly productive potentially peat-forming helophytes as Phragmites australis by establishing adequate water levels. If nutrients are to be removed from the degraded peatland, then management can combine the restoration of helophyte stands by rewetting with harvesting measures.

AB Understanding the spatio-temporal variability of controls on peatland carbon (C) cycling is essential to project the effects of future environmental change. While there is understanding of individual drivers of C cycling, the effect of multiple drivers, including interactions, remains poorly understood. Using a spatially and temporally explicit sampling framework, we examined the effects of biotic and abiotic controls on key indicators of peatland functioning: ecosystem respiration (R (eco)), photosynthesis (P (cal)), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), methane (CH4) fluxes, and pore water dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]). Measurements were made over 12 months in a blanket peatland hosting a wind farm in Scotland, UK. Overall, we found that (i) season and plant functional type (PFT) explained most variation in R (eco) and P (cal), (ii) PFT and spatial location within the wind farm, which integrates several peat properties, were dominant predictors of CH4 fluxes, and (iii) season and location within the wind farm correlated with pore water [DOC]. Examination of predictors indicated that interactions, between and within biotic and abiotic factors, explained a significant amount of variation in greenhouse gas fluxes and [DOC]. These findings indicate that combinations of biotic and abiotic factors could mediate or exacerbate the effects of future environmental change on peatland C cycling. Given this, studies of C cycling need to capture the spatial and temporal variance of biotic and abiotic factors and their interactions to project the likely impacts of environmental change.

AB Drainage for forestry has been amongst the most extensive of land management practices applied to northern latitude peatlands, particularly in northern Europe. Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the carbon cycle of soils. This study investigated the effects of long-term (45 years) drainage for forestry upon surface peat extracellular phenol oxidase activity, soluble phenolic concentrations and pH at ombrotrophic bog, oligotrophic fen and mesotrophic fen sites at a Finnish mire complex. Phenol oxidase activity was reduced by drainage at all three sites. Phenol oxidase activity was positively correlated with peat pH across all sites irrespective of drainage treatment, suggesting that pH is a major factor influencing peat phenol oxidase activity at the mire complex. Peat pH became more acidic with drainage at the fen sites, and it is likely that this contributed to the suppression of peat phenol oxidase activity. The reduction of peat phenol oxidase activity with drainage was accompanied by increased concentrations of water-soluble phenolics at all three sites, and the potential contribution of this to changes in peat carbon stocks following drainage is discussed.

AB This study describes the analysis of fluvial carbon flux from an upland peat catchment in the North Pennines. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, alkalinity and calcium were measured in weekly samples, with particulate organic carbon (POC) measured from the suspended sediment load from the stream outlet of an 11.4-km(2) catchment. For calendar year 1999, regular monitoring of the catchment was supplemented with detailed quasi-continuous measurements of flow and stream temperature, and DOC for the months September through November. The measurements were used to calculate the annual flux of dissolved CO,, dissolved inorganic carbon, DOC and POC from the catchment and were combined with CO, and CH, gaseous exchanges calculated from previously published values and the observations of water table height within the peat. The study catchment represents a net sink of 15.4+/-11.9 gC/m(2)/yr. Carbon flows calculated for the study catchment are combined with values in the literature, using a Monte Carlo method, to estimate the carbon budget for British upland peat. For all British upland peat the calculation suggests a net carbon sink of between 0.15 and 0.29 MtC/yr. This is the first study to include a comprehensive study of the fluvial export of carbon within carbon budgets and shows the size of the peat carbon sink to be smaller than previous estimates, although sensitivity analysis shows that the primary productivity rather than fluvial carbon flux is a more important element in estimating the carbon budget in this regard.

AB It is essential that scientists be able to predict how strong climate warming, including profound changes to winter climate, will affect the ecosystem services of alpine, arctic and boreal areas, and how these services are driven by vegetation-soil feedbacks. One fruitful avenue for studying such changing feedbacks is through plant functional traits, as an understanding of these traits may help us to understand and synthesise (1) responses of vegetation (through 'response traits' and 'specific response functions' of each species) to winter climate and (2) the effects of changing vegetation composition (through 'effect traits' and 'specific effect functions' of each species) on soil functions. It is the relative correspondence of variation in response and effect traits that will provide useful data on the impacts of winter climate change on carbon and nutrient cycling processes. Here we discuss several examples of how the trait-based, response-effect framework can help scientists to better understand the effects of winter warming on key ecosystem functions in cold biomes. These examples support the view that measuring species for their response and effect traits, and how these traits are linked across species through correspondence of variation in specific response and effects functions, may be a useful approach for teasing out the contribution of changing vegetation composition to winter warming effects on ecosystem functions. This approach will be particularly useful when linked with ecosystem-level measurements of vegetation and process responses to winter warming along natural gradients, over medium time scales in given sites or in response to experimental climate manipulations.

AB Northern peatlands store ca. 1/3 of the world's soil organic carbon and this is attributed to low decomposition rates as a result of waterlogged, anaerobic conditions and high levels of phenolic substances. Climate change models predict both an increase in summer droughts and increased rainfall, depending on region, but information on the effect of these changes on the microbial population that mediate phenolic degradation is sparse. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGGE) was therefore used to assess the effect of simulated summer drought and increased rainfall on the diversity of phenolic degrading bacteria in a northern peatland using the gene XylE, encoding for the enzyme Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), as an indicator. Under simulated drought, a greater diversity (129.4%, P < 0.05) and abundance of phenolic catabolising bacterial species was found. Concurrent increased total phenol oxidase activities (83.3%) and beta-glucosidase activities (157.6%, P < 0.01) were found with consistently lower concentrations of phenolic compounds, DOC and increased CO2 fluxes. This increased mineralisation is likely to lower carbon storage capacity and increase climate forcing. Conversely, the increased rainfall simulation suppressed diversity (62.2%, P < 0.05), abundance and phenol oxidase activities (103.3%, P < 0.001), giving increased phenolic compound (424.8%, P < 0.1 only) and DOC concentrations (201.3%, P < 0.001), along with increased anaerobic trace gas fluxes. These hugely increased aquatic carbon concentrations available for export are of serious concern due to their deleterious effect on drinking water quality. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A large portion of the global carbon pool is stored in peatlands, which are sensitive to a changing environment conditions. The hydrological loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is believed to play a key role in determining the carbon balance in peatlands. Zoige peatland, the largest peat store in China, is experiencing climatic warming and drying as well as experiencing severe artificial drainage. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we experimentally manipulated temperature and controlled the water tables in large mesocosms containing intact peat monoliths. Specifically, we determined the impact of warming and water table position on the hydrological loss of DOC, the exported amounts, concentrations and qualities of DOC, and the discharge volume in Zoige peatland. Our results revealed that of the water table position had a greater impact on DOC export than the warming treatment, which showed no interactive effects with the water table treatment. Both DOC concentration and discharge volume were significantly increased when water table drawdown, while only the DOC concentration was significantly promoted by warming treatment. Annual DOC export was increased by 69% and 102% when the water table, controlled at 0 cm, was experimentally lowered by -10 cm and -20 cm. Increases in colored and aromatic constituents of DOC (measured by Abs(254 nm), SUVA(254 nm), Abs(400 nm), and SUVA(400 nm)) were observed under the lower water tables and at the higher peat temperature. Our results provide an indication of the potential impacts of climatic change and anthropogenic drainage on the carbon cycle and/or water storage in a peatland and simultaneously imply the likelihood of potential damage to downstream ecosystems. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for local protection and sustainable development, as well as suggest that more research is required to better understand the impacts of climatic change and artificial disturbances on peatland degradation.

In contrast, they differ in land use history: at the Schechenfilz site a natural bog-pine forest (Pinus mugo ssp. rotundata) grows on an undisturbed, about 5m thick peat layer; at Mooseurach a planted spruce forest (Picea abies) grows on drained and degraded peat (3.4 m). The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at both sites has been investigated for 2 years (July 2010-June 2012), using the eddy covariance technique. Our results indicate that the drained, forested bog at Mooseurach is a much stronger carbon dioxide sink (-130 +/- 31 and -300 +/- 66 g C m(-2) a(-1) in the first and second year, respectively) than the natural bog forest at Schechenfilz (-53 +/- 28 and -73 +/- 38 g C m(-2) a(-1)). The strong net CO2 uptake can be explained by the high gross primary productivity of the 44-year old spruces that overcompensates the two-times stronger ecosystem respiration at the drained site. The larger productivity of the spruces can be clearly attributed to the larger plant area index (PAI) of the spruce site. However, even though current flux measurements indicate strong CO2 uptake of the drained spruce forest, the site is a strong net CO2 source when the whole life-cycle since forest planting is considered. It is important to access this result in terms of the long-term biome balance. To do so, we used historical data to estimate the difference between carbon fixation by the spruces and the carbon loss from the peat due to drainage since forest planting. This rough estimate indicates a strong carbon release of +134 t C ha(-1) within the last 44 years. Thus, the spruces would need to grow for another 100 years at about the current rate, to compensate the potential peat loss of the former years. In contrast, the natural bog-pine ecosystem has likely been a small but stable carbon sink for decades, which our results suggest is very robust regarding short-term changes of environmental factors.

AB The importance of soil storage in global carbon cycling is well recognised and factors leading to increased losses from this pool may act as a positive feedback mechanism in global warming. Upland peat soils are usually assumed to serve as carbon sinks, there is however increasing evidence of carbon loss from upland peat soils, and DOC concentrations in UK rivers have increased markedly over the past three decades. A number of drivers for increasing DOC release from peat soils have been proposed although many of these would not explain fine-scale variations in DOC release observed in many catchments.
   We examined the effect of land use and management on DOC production in upland peat catchments at two spatial scales within the UK. DOC concentration was measured in streams draining 50 small-scale catchments (< 3 km(2)) in three discrete regions of the south Pennines and one area in the North Yorkshire Moors. Annual mean DOC concentration was also derived from water colour data recorded at water treatment works for seven larger scale catchments (1.5-20 km(2)) in the south Pennines. Soil type and land use/management in all catchments were characterised from NSRI digital soil data and ortho-corrected colour aerial imagery.
   Of the factors assessed, representing all combinations of soil type and land use together with catchment slope and area, the proportion of exposed peat surface resulting from new heather burning was consistently identified as the most significant predictor of variation in DOC concentration. This relationship held across all blanket peat catchments and scales.
   We propose that management activities are driving changes in edaphic conditions in upland peat to those more favourable for aerobic microbial activity and thus enhance peat decomposition leading to increased losses of carbon from these environments. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle, and loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has been shown to be important for peatland carbon budgets. The objective of this Study was to determine how net production and export of DOC from a northern peatland may be affected by disturbance Such as drainage and climate change.
   The study was conducted at a poor fen containing several pool-ridge complexes: (1) control site-no water table manipulation; (2) experimental site-monitored for one season in a natural state and then subjected to a water table drawdown for 3 years: (3) drained site-subjected to a water table drawdown 9 years prior to monitoring. The DOC concentration was measured in pore water along a microtopographic gradient at each site (hummock, lawn and hollow), in standing water in pools, and in discharge from the experimental and drained sites. The initial water table drawdown released similar to 3 g of carbon per square metre in the form of DOC, providing a large pulse of DOC to downstream ecosystems. This Value, however, represents only 1-9% of ecosystem respiration at this site. Seasonal losses of DOC following drainage were 8-11 g of carbon per square metre, representing similar to 17% of the total carbon exchange at (lie experimental Study site. Immediately following water table drawdown. DOC concentrations were elevated in pore water and open water pools. In subsequent seasons, DOC concentration in the pool declined, but remained higher than the control site even 11 years after water-table drawdown. This suggests continued elevated net DOC production Under lower water table conditions likely related to an increase in vegetation biomass and larger water table fluctuations at the experimental and drained sites. However, the increase in concentration was limited to initially wet microforms (lawns and hollows) reflecting differences in vegetation community changes, watertable and soil subsidence along the microtopographic gradient.

AB Stream water carbon concentrations can be highly dynamic on the time scales of both individual storm events and seasonal hydroclimatic shifts. We collected stream water daily over a 6-day storm from three headwater subcatchments of varying landcover (poor fen, forested wetland, and upland forest) and the catchment outlet to evaluate how precipitation events impact the concentration and speciation of carbon (organic vs. inorganic) as well as the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported laterally from coastal temperate rainforest catchments. Dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations increased during the storm at all sites, while dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations were diluted during peak flows. These results highlight the importance of quantifying all forms of lateral carbon export when evaluating the role of storms in catchment-scale carbon cycling. Isotopic hydrograph separation using stream water delta O-18 showed that percent new water was significantly related to carbon concentration and form providing a clear link between stream water sources (i.e., recent event water) and soil carbon source areas that become connected to surface water during storms. Furthermore, ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry showed that stream water DOM exported from the upland forest contained the greatest molecular diversity of the three landscape types and had the largest changes in composition over the storm suggesting that the wetland-dominated subcatchments were less compositionally diverse with regard to soil DOM pools active during the storm. Overall, this study provides insight into hydro-biogeochemical drivers that control lateral carbon export from forested catchments in a region where an increasing fraction of precipitation is falling as rain.

The specific methylotrophic methanogenic activity of the enriched reactor sludge at pH 5 was 3.57 g COD g-1 volatile suspended solids day-1 and the apparent doubling time of the biomass was 15.8 h. Acidic conditions were obligatory, since the enrichment culture was not able to produce methane or to grow at pH 7. Based on morphological characteristics, the dominant methanogenic species in the enrichment culture was a Methanosarcina.

AB Runaway expansion of shallow ponds can catalyze the conversion of vegetated marshes into open water environments. Predicting how this transition affects ecosystem functioning is difficult because little is known about pond biogeochemistry. We characterized sediment organic matter sources and transformations in three ponds with different plant communities, over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, using a combination of stable isotopes, lipid biomarkers, and benthic fluxes. Sediment respiration rates (1.66 +/- 0.09 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) to 28.53 +/- 7.76 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) were comparable to shallow estuaries and driven by sulfate reduction. Rates varied across ponds, reflecting differences in summertime Ruppia maritima and macroalgae abundances, but were similar between seasons. Interactions between above-ground plant and sediment bacterial communities translated into distinct biogeochemical processes across the three ponds. Tidal isolation and summer weather intensified plant and bacterial community effects on pond carbon dynamics, resulting in algal biomass and lipid delta C-13 values that were 3-12 parts per thousand enriched, compared to nearby habitats. Surface sediment organic matter mainly derived from pond microalgae and was compositionally distinct from tidal creeks and marshes. Surprisingly, sediment bacteria were not tightly coupled to benthic microalgae but decomposed multiple carbon sources in surface sediments and became increasingly reliant on buried peat at deeper horizons. Pond development over time could largely be explained by sediment respiration and the simultaneous accretion of the surrounding marsh platform. The role of decomposition in pond expansion is consistent with previous assessments based on whole-pond metabolism rates. Consequently, future pond expansion could alter ecosystem biogeochemistry and reduce carbon storage.

AB Tracing the inputs of bacterial organic carbon to marine systems has been constrained by the lack of distinguishing geochemical tracers and limited contribution in sediments compared to other sources of organic matter. Bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) provide a direct means to identify bacterial inputs which also reflect potential bacterial groups and their activities in aquatic systems. We applied recent analytical approaches to identify and quantify bacterial derived carbon contributions to surface sediments from the western Arctic Ocean using BHPs. The abundance and distribution of BHPs resemble trends of water column primary production and suggest active heterotrophic recycling of in situ production with some component of long term preservation. BHPs proposed as terrestrial derived signatures (i.e. adenosylhopanes) were also abundant in western Arctic sediments and reflect offshore trends of other terrigenous lipid signatures with a fraction representing their degradative products. Analysis of BHPs in organic rich peat and surface sediments from two Arctic rivers showed the highest inputs of adenosylhopanes, implying active bacterial recycling of recalcitrant terrigenous material. BHPs observed in western Arctic surface sediments reveal significant contributions of bacteria associated with organic carbon from multiple sources. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among different methods of estimation of this exchange, the eddy-covariance (EC) technique provides a direct measure of the net flux density across the atmosphere-ecosystem interface. Still, such data are highly scarce for Central European wetlands. In this work, we present the results of two years (2013-2014) of continuous open-path EC measurements of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at the wetlands of the Biebrza National Park in northeastern Poland - one of the biggest coherent lowland wetland area in Central Europe. The measurement site (53(circle)35'30.8"N, 22(circle)53'32.4"E) was located near the Kopytkowka river in a fen peatland, whose soils are slightly decomposed due to dehydration. The mean annual sum of CH4 release equaled 29 +/- 4g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in wetter year 2013 and 20 +/- 1g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) in drier year 2014. The mean annual uptake of CO2 reached 980 +/- 150 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) and 560 +/- 130 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Both fluxes show a clear annual pattern with maximum CH4 release in June and July (at a level of 130 nmol m(-2) s(-1)) and maximum CO2 uptake in June (at a level of 4.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The considerable C-CO2 uptake in comparison to C-CH4 emissions suggests that the Biebrza river wetlands are a significant carbon sink, but the net contribution of the Biebrza mires to the climate forcing is unclear because of different metrics which can be used to specify the relative weights of CO2 and CH4.

AB Ecosystems are increasingly prone to climate extremes, such as drought, with long-lasting effects on both plant and soil communities and, subsequently, on carbon (C) cycling. However, recent studies underlined the strong variability in ecosystem's response to droughts, raising the issue of nonlinear responses in plant and soil communities. The conundrum is what causes ecosystems to shift in response to drought. Here, we investigated the response of plant and soil fungi to drought of different intensities using a water table gradient in peatlands-a major C sink ecosystem. Using moving window structural equationmodels, we show that substantial changes in ecosystem respiration, plant and soil fungal communities occurred when the water level fell below a tipping point of -24cm. As a corollary, ecosystem respiration was the greatest when graminoids and saprotrophic fungi became prevalent as a response to the extreme drought. Graminoids indirectly influenced fungal functional composition and soil enzyme activities through their direct effect on dissolved organic matter quality, while saprotrophic fungi directly influenced soil enzyme activities. In turn, increasing enzyme activities promoted ecosystem respiration. We show that functional transitions in ecosystem respiration critically depend on the degree of response of graminoids and saprotrophic fungi to drought. Our results represent a major advance in understanding the nonlinear nature of ecosystem properties to drought and pave the way towards a truly mechanistic understanding of the effects of drought on ecosystem processes.

AB We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), plant biomass and growth, species composition, peat microclimate, and litter decomposition in a fertilization experiment at Mer Bleue Bog, Ottawa, Ontario. The bog is located in the zone with the highest atmospheric nitrogen deposition for Canada, estimated at 0.8-1.2 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (wet deposition as NH4 and NO3). To establish the effect of nutrient addition on this ecosystem, we fertilized the bog with six treatments involving the application of 1.6-6 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (as NH4NO3), with and without P and K, in triplicate 3 m x 3 m plots. The initial 5-6 years have shown a loss of first Sphagnum, then Polytrichum mosses, and an increase in vascular plant biomass and leaf area index. Analyses of NEE, measured in situ with climate-controlled chambers, indicate that contrary to expectations, the treatments with the highest levels of nutrient addition showed lower rates of maximum NEE and gross photosynthesis, but little change in ecosystem respiration after 5 years. Although shrub biomass and leaf area increased in the high nutrient plots, loss of moss photosynthesis owing to nutrient toxicity, increased vascular plant shading and greater litter accumulation contributed to the lower levels of CO2 uptake. Our study highlights the importance of long-term experiments as we did not observe lower NEE until the fifth year of the experiment. However, this may be a transient response as the treatment plots continue to change. Higher levels of nutrients may cause changes in plant composition and productivity and decrease the ability of peatlands to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere.

AB Northern peatlands are a large source of atmospheric methane (CH4) and both a source and a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The rate and temporal variability in gas exchanges with peat soils is directly related to the spatial distribution of these free-phase gases within the peat column. In this paper, we present results from surface and borehole ground-penetrating radar surveys - constrained with direct soil and gas sampling - that compare the spatial distribution of gas accumulations in two raised bogs: one in Wales (UK), the other in Maine (USA). Although the two peatlands have similar average thickness, physical properties of the peat matrix differ, particularly in terms of peat type and degree of humification. We hypothesize that these variations in physical properties are responsible for the differences in gas distribution between the two peatlands characterized by (1) gas content up to 10.8% associated with woody peat and presence of wood layers in Caribou Bog (Maine) and (2) a more homogenous distribution with gas content up to 5.7% at the surface (i.e. <0.5m deep) in Cors Fochno (Wales). Our results highlight the variability in biogenic gas accumulation and distribution across peatlands and suggest that the nature of the peat matrix has a key role in defining how biogenic gas accumulates within and is released to the atmosphere from peat soils.

AB Increases in solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-320 nm) reaching the earth have been estimated to continue until 2050s in the boreal and subarctic regions with an abundant peatland cover. Peatlands are significant sinks for carbon dioxide (CO2) and sources for methane (CH4). To assess whether the future increases in UV-B could affect the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in peatlands via an impact on vegetation, we exposed peatland microcosms to modulated 30% supplementation of erythemally weighted UV-B at an outdoor facility for one growing season. The experimental design included appropriate controls for UV-A and ambient radiation. The UV-B caused a significant reduction in gross photosynthesis, net ecosystem CO2 exchange, and CH4 emission of the peatland microcosms. These changes in the carbon gas cycling can be partly explained by UV-B-induced morphological changes in Eriophorum vaginatum which acts as a conduit for CH4. Leaf cross section and the percentage of CH4-conducting aerenchymatous tissue in E. vaginatum were significantly reduced by UV-B. Methanol-extractable UV-B absorbing compounds decreased under both UV-B and UV-A in Sphagnum angustifolium, and tended to accumulate under UV-B in S. papillosum. Membrane permeability to magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) ions was higher in UV-B exposed S. angustifolium. Amount of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments was increased by UV-A in S. magellanicum. The observed changes in Sphagnum mosses did not coincide with those in carbon gas fluxes but occurred at the time of the highest UV intensity in the mid summer. Our findings indicate that increasing UV-B may have more substantial effects on gas exchange in peatlands than previously thought.

AB Soil, tree stems, and ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes were measured by chambers and eddy covariance methods in a paludified shallow-peat spruce forest in the southern taiga of European Russia (Tver region, 56 degrees N 33 degrees E) during the growing seasons of 2002-2012. The site was established in 1998 as part of the EUROSIBERIAN CARBONFLUX project, an international field experiment examining atmosphere-biosphere interaction in Siberia and European Russia. In all years the observed annual cumulative net ecosystem flux was positive (the forest was a source of carbon to the atmosphere). Soil and tree stem respiration was a significant part of the total ecosystem respiration (ER) in this paludified shallow-peat spruce forest. On average, 49% of the ER came from soil respiration. We found that the soil fluxes exhibited high seasonal variability, ranging from 0.7 to 10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Generally, the soil respiration depended on the soil temperature and ground water level. In drought conditions, the soil respiration was low and did not depend on temperature. The stem respiration of spruces grew intensively in May, had permanently high values from June to the end of September, and in October it dramatically decreased. The tree stem respiration in midsummer was about 3-5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for dominant trees and about 1-2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for subdominant trees. The respiration of living tree stems was about 10-20% of the ER.

AB Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas that plays a prominent role in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, and is released to the atmosphere from freshwater systems in numerous biomes globally. Radiocarbon (C-14) analysis can indicate both the age and source of CH4 in natural environments. In contrast to CH4 present in bubbles released from aquatic sediments (ebullition), dissolved CH4 in lakes and streams can be present in low concentrations compared to carbon dioxide (CO2), and therefore obtaining sufficient aquatic CH4 for radiocarbon (C-14) analysis remains a major technical challenge. Previous studies have shown that freshwater CH4, in both dissolved and ebullitive form, can be significantly older than other forms of aquatic C, and it is therefore important to characterise this part of the terrestrial C balance. This study presents a novel method to capture sufficient amounts of dissolved CH4 for C-14 analysis in freshwater environments by circulating water across a hydrophobic, gas-permeable membrane and collecting the CH4 in a large headspace volume. The results of laboratory and field tests show that reliable dissolved delta(CH4)-C-13 and (CH4)-C-14 samples can be readily collected over short time periods (similar to 4-24 h), at relatively low cost and from a variety of surface water types. The initial results further support previous findings that dissolved CH4 may be significantly older than other forms of aquatic C, and is currently unaccounted for in many terrestrial C balances and models. This method is suitable for use in remote locations, and could potentially be used to detect the leakage of unique (CH4)-C-14 signatures from point sources into waterways, e.g. coal seam gas and landfill gas.

AB Freshwater wetlands are unique aquatic ecosystems, which are a tremendous source of organic carbon. A bacterial community plays a significant role in the carbon cycle of organic matter through its cellulolytic enzymes; namely, cellulases. For this study, culturable bacteria were isolated from a freshwater wetland reserve situated in Thailand and screened for their cellulase production. Seventy-six cellulolytic bacteria were grouped by a PCR-RFLP of 16S rDNA technique and identified by a nucleotide sequencing analysis. A total of 17 different RFLP patterns were obtained, belonging to nine bacterial genera including Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Chromobacterium, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Herbaspirillum, Paenibacillus and Vibrio. The predominant genera of the isolated cellulolytic bacteria were Bacillus, Chromobacterium and Herbaspirillum. The cellulolytic bacterium isolated from the moist peat samples designated as B. megaterium strain S0702 could produce three types of cellulases and showed the highest CMCase activity at 4.48 +/- 0.08 U/mL. The optimum pH and temperature for the CMCase activity were determined to be 45 - 50 degrees C at a pH of 7.0 with a stability range of 25 60 degrees C and pH 5.0 - 8.0. The CMCase activity was greatly enhanced by Mn2+ and considerably inhibited by EDTA and ethyl-acetate. This enzyme could possibly be used in various biotechnological applications.

AB It is generally known that managed, drained peatlands act as carbon (C) sources. In this study we examined how mitigation through the reduction of the intensity of land management and through rewetting may affect the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and the C balance of intensively managed, drained, agricultural peatlands. Carbon and GHG balances were determined for three peatlands in the western part of the Netherlands from 2005 to 2008 by considering spatial and temporal variability of emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O). One area (Oukoop) is an intensively managed grass-on-peatland area, including a dairy farm, with the ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.55 (+/- 0.37) m below the soil surface. The second area (Stein) is an extensively managed grass-on-peatland area, formerly intensively managed, with a dynamic ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.45 (+/- 0.35) m below the soil surface. The third area is a (since 1998) rewetted former agricultural peatland (Horstermeer), close to Oukoop and Stein, with the average annual ground water level at a depth of 0.2 (+/- 0.20) m below the soil surface. During the measurement campaigns we found that both agriculturally managed sites acted as C and GHG sources and the rewetted former agricultural peatland acted as a C and GHG sink. The ecosystem (fields and ditches) total GHG balance, including CO2, CH4 and N2O, amounted to 3.9 (+/- 0.4), 1.3 (+/- 0.5) and -1.7 (+/- 1.8) g CO2-eq m(-2) d(-1) for Oukoop, Stein and Horstermeer, respectively. Adding the farm-based emissions to Oukoop and Stein resulted in a total GHG emission of 8.3 (+/- 1.0) and 6.6 (+/- 1.3) gCO(2)-eq m(-2) d(-1), respectively. For Horstermeer the GHG balance remained the same since no farm-based emissions exist. Considering the C balance (uncertainty range 40-60 %), the total C release in Oukoop and Stein is 5270 and 6258 kg Cha(-1) yr(-1), respectively (including ecosystem and management fluxes), and the total C uptake in Horstermeer is 3538 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Water bodies contributed significantly to the terrestrial GHG balance because of a high release of CH4.
   Overall, this study suggests that managed peatlands are large sources of GHGs and C, but, if appropriate measures are taken, they can be turned back into GHG and C sinks within 15 years of abandonment and rewetting. The shift from an intensively managed grass-on-peat area (Oukoop) to an extensively managed one (Stein) reduced the GHG emissions mainly because N2O emission and farm-based CH4 emissions decreased.

AB Many peatlands have been drained and harvested for peat mining, agriculture, and other purposes, which has turned them from carbon (C) sinks into C emitters. Rewetting of disturbed peatlands facilitates their ecological recovery and may help them revert to carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks. However, rewetting may also cause substantial emissions of the more potent greenhouse gas (GHG) methane (CH4). Our knowledge of the exchange of CO2 and CH4 following rewetting during restoration of disturbed peatlands is currently limited. This study quantifies annual fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in a disturbed and rewetted area located in the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area in Delta, BC, Canada. Burns Bog is recognized as the largest raised bog ecosystem on North America's west coast. Burns Bog was substantially reduced in size and degraded by peat mining and agriculture. Since 2005, the bog has been declared a conservancy area, with restoration efforts focusing on rewetting disturbed ecosystems to recover Sphagnum and suppress fires. Using the eddy covariance (EC) technique, we measured year-round (16 June 2015 to 15 June 2016) turbulent fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from a tower platform in an area rewetted for the last 8 years. The study area, dominated by sedges and Sphagnum, experienced a varying water table position that ranged between 7.7 (inundation) and -26.5 cm from the surface during the study year. The annual CO2 budget of the rewetted area was -179 +/- 26.2 gCO(2)-Cm-2 yr(-1) (CO2 sink) and the annual CH4 budget was 17 +/- 1.0 gCH(4-)Cm(-2) yr(-1) (CH4 source). Gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) exceeded ecosystem respiration (R-e) during summer months (June-August), causing a net CO2 uptake. In summer, high CH4 emissions (121 mgCH(4)-Cm-2 day(-1)) were measured. In winter (December-February), while roughly equal magnitudes of GEP and R-e made the study area CO2 neutral, very low CH4 emissions (9 mgCH(4)-Cm-2 day(-1)) were observed. The key environmental factors controlling the seasonality of these exchanges were downwelling photosynthetically active radiation and 5 cm soil temperature. It appears that the high water table caused by ditch blocking suppressed R-e. With low temperatures in winter, CH4 emissions were more suppressed than R-e. Annual net GHG flux from CO2 and CH4 expressed in terms of CO2 equivalents (CO2 eq.) during the study period totalled -22 +/- 103.1 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) y(-1) (net CO2 eq. sink) and 1248 +/- 147.6 gCO(2) eq. m(-2) yr(-1) (net CO2 eq. source) by using 100- and 20-year global warming potential values, respectively. Consequently, the ecosystem was almost CO2 eq. neutral during the study period expressed on a 100-year time horizon but was a significant CO2 eq. source on a 20-year time horizon.

AB Boreal peatlands are key high-latitude ecosystem types and act as a carbon (C) sink storing an estimated 25% of the world's soil C. These environments are currently seeing the most substantial changing climate, especially during the winter. CO2 emissions during the winter can correspond to 80% of the growing season's net CO2 assimilation. Yet, our conceptual understanding of the controls on microbial metabolic activity in peat soils at temperatures <= 0 degrees C is poor. We used stable isotope probing of peat samples and tracked the fate of C-13-glucose using C-13-NMR. We show that microorganisms in frozen boreal peat soils utilize monomeric C-substrates to sustain both catabolic and anabolic metabolism at temperatures down to -5 degrees C. The C-13-substrate was transformed into C-13-CO2, different metabolites, and incorporated into membrane phospholipid fatty acids. The 16S rRNA-based community analyses revealed the activity at -3 degrees C changes the composition of the bacterial cornmunity over relevant timescales. Below 0 degrees C, small temperature changes have strong effects on process rates and small differences in winter soil temperature may affect C dynamics of northern peatlands. Understanding biological processes at low and below zero temperatures are central for the overall functioning of these systems representing one of the world's major soil C pools.

DE Peatland restoration; Mounding; Carbon dioxide; Methane; Greenhouse gas

AB Oil sands exploration activities across the Alberta boreal peatlands requires tree clearing and results in sites being left compressed and with altered understory vegetation. Restoration techniques, including planting trees, mechanical mounding with tree planting, and spreading coarse woody debris have been tested across abandoned oil sands exploration sites. In this study two oil sands exploration sites were monitored 6- and 9-years post-treatment, along with two control areas disturbed 20 years ago with no active restoration treatment. Results were compared to a natural reference site to understand how various restoration techniques influenced carbon flux and growing season carbon balance. Tree ingress was observed across all parts of the restored oil sands exploration sites except a wet control area disturbed 20 years ago. The creation of dry microsites through the mechanical mounding technique substantially increased tree productivity, and we found that 9 years post-restoration the mounded area of an oil sands exploration site had a tree net primary productivity similar to the natural site. This carbon uptake, however, was partially offset by large emissions of methane from pools adjacent to mounds. We found that planting trees only could result in a growing season carbon balance that is within the range of a natural peatland 9 years following restoration. However, our estimates indicate that the mounding treatment 9 years following restoration released less carbon to the atmosphere overall compared to all other restoration treatments and control areas. This restoration technique may be useful if the restoration goal is focused on returning the carbon storage function at disturbed sites. As well as understanding attainability of restoration goals, evaluating ecohydrologic conditions of oil sands exploration sites pre-restoration is critical for informing the most appropriate restoration technique.

AB Recent research suggested that iron oxidation may protect carbon from drought-accelerated decomposition in wetlands by promoting the sorption of lignin derivatives and decreasing phenolic oxidase activities. Here we examined whether this mechanism exists in organic-rich peatlands, which store over 30% of the world's soil carbon, by simulating drought and flooded conditions in peat soil with and without the addition of reduced iron. Our results suggest that iron does not protect carbon from decomposition in organic-rich peatlands, and in fact iron may exacerbate carbon decomposition via precipitation of phenolic compounds, which otherwise have been shown to inhibit microbial activity. In addition, scanning electron microscopy analyses of different types of peat soil from Minnesota to Peru showed evidence of iron-sulfide minerals (pyrite), indicating that some portion of the reduced iron in peatlands is effectively immobilized and therefore does not interact with the carbon cycle.

AB Carbon sequestering in peatlands is believed to be a major climate-regulating mechanism throughout the late Phanerozoic. Since plant life first evolved on land, peatlands have been significant carbon sinks, which could explain significant parts of the large variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide observed in various records. The result is peat in different degrees of metamorphosis, i.e. lignite, hard coal and graphite. During phases of extensive glaciations such as the 330240 Ma Pangea Ice Age, atmospheric carbon dioxide was critically low. This pattern repeats itself during the Pleistocene when carbon dioxide oscillates with an amplitude of c. 200-300 ppmv. This paper suggests that the ice age cycles during the Pleistocene are generated by the interglacial growth of peatlands and the subsequent sequestering of carbon into this terrestrial pool. The final initiation of ice age pulses towards the end of interglacials, on the other hand, is attributed to the cyclic influx of cosmic dust to the Earth surface, which in turn regulates cloud formation and the in coming shortwave radiation. These shorter cycles have a frequency of c. 1000-1250 years and might be connected to sunspot or other low frequency solar variations. In a wider context the ice age cycling could be regarded as an interplay between terrestrial life on the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere and the marine subsurface life in the southeast.
   If the results presented here are correct, the present global warming might just be the early part of a new warm period such as the Bronze Age and the Roman and Medieval Warm periods. This could be caused by entry into another phase of decreasing influx rates of cosmic dust. The increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide might have contributed to this warming but, most important of all, it might temporarily.

AB The understanding of microbial biodiversity in peatlands has grown considerably over the past two decades. This is encouraging, given the global distribution of peatlands and their potentially increasing significance under a changing climate, particularly as it pertains to carbon cycling. The purpose of this review is to compile a comprehensive list of fungi that have been reported from peatlands and to summarize their general roles in these ecosystems. To date, 601 species of fungi have been identified globally from peatlands. Ascomycetes are the largest group with 276 species (46%), followed by basidiomycetes (243 species, 40%), zygomycetes (55 species, 9%), and chytridiomycetes (26 species, 4%). The most species-rich genera are Penicillium (48 species), Galerina (41 species), and Mortierella (20 species). The 20 most common fungal genera account for 252 of the 601 species (42%) in peatlands. From a functional perspective, most fungi in peatlands are saprobes and are involved in the decomposition of organic matter. A better understanding of this group of fungi will allow us to better predict carbon dynamics in the future.

SO COLLOID JOURNAL

DT Article
AB The influence of various reclamation agents (montmorillonite, peat, activated sludge microbocenosis) on the stability of dispersions of the colloidal fraction of meadow chernozem soil is studied. It is established that biocolloids possess the strongest coagulating action in the aforementioned series of reclamation agents. It is shown that, in the process of microorganism growth involving glucose. or polypeptides as a carbon source, exopolymers are synthesized that caused the coagulation of soil dispersions. Upon the growth of microorganisms on polypeptides (alkaligeneous metabolism), precipitates are formed that are denser and less peptized by water than those grown on glucose (acidogeneous metabolism). The addition of montmorillonite and peat intensifies the aggregation processes in soil-microbe heterodispersions. The inverse relationship between the content of an organic substance in a colloidal system and the stability of aggregates of soil colloids is revealed.

AB Sedges (Cyperaceae) are dominant plants in many northern wetlands and contribute to the carbon cycling in several ways. In order to more accurately estimate the carbon balance of a wetland it is essential to be able to simulate the temporal changes of the leaf area of the sedges. Our aim was to test the ability of a simple carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange model to predict the seasonal development of sedge leaf area index (LAI). The model simulates the development of sedge LAI that depends on carbon gain/loss in net photosynthesis, utilization of stored carbon in spring, and LAI decline due to senescence in late summer. The net photosynthesis model is driven by LA!, air temperature, water table depth and photosynthetically active radiation. We parameterized and validated the model with two years of observational LAI data from two boreal pristine peatland sites and included data points from both pristine and manipulated (drainage and warming) treatment plots. Model parameter values other than the timing of the start of senescence, LAI decline rate in senescence and size of carbon storage were independent of observational data. The model successfully simulated the seasonal course of LAI development and is thus an easy and adjustable tool for producing estimates of sedge LAI for other peatland sites. It can be adjusted to different sites although it cannot predict the exact LAI level of a site that is controlled by site characteristics. Its ability to simulate the interannual variation in this two-year dataset was inadequate so there is a need to test the model against longer time series of measured LAIs in order to validate models' capability to predict the interannual variability of LAI.

AB Black carbon (BC), the byproduct of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass can be stored in soil for a long time and potentially archive changes in natural and human activities. Increasing amounts of BC has been produced from human activities during the past 150 years and has influenced global climate change and carbon cycle. Identifying historical BC sources is important in knowing how historical human activities influenced BC and BC transportation processes in the atmosphere. In this study, PAH components and delta C-13-BC in peatland in the Sanjiang Plain were used for identifying and verifying regional BC sources during the last 150 years. Results showed that environment-unfriendly industry developed at the end of the 1950s produced a great amount of BC and contributed the most BC in this period. In other periods, however, BC in the Sanjiang Plain was mainly produced from incomplete biomass burning before the 1990s; particularly, slash-and-burn of pastures and forests during regional reclamation periods between the 1960s and 1980s produced a huge amount of biomass burning BC, which then deposited into the surrounding ecosystems. With the regional reclamation decreasing and environment-friendly industry developing, the proportion of BC emitted and deposited from transportation sources increased and transportation source became an important BC source in the Sanjiang Plain after the 1990s.

AB As most ecosystems, peatlands have been heavily exploited for different human purposes. For example, in Finland the majority is under forestry, agriculture or peat mining use. Peatlands play an important role in carbon storage, water cycle, and are a unique habitat for rare organisms. Such properties highlight their environmental importance and the need for their restoration. To monitor the success of peatland restoration sensitive indicators are needed. Here we test whether testate amoebae can be used as a reliable bioindicator for assessing peatland condition. To qualify as reliable indicators, responses in testate amoebae community structure to ecological changes must be stronger than random spatial and temporal variation. In this study, we simultaneously assessed differences between the effects of seasonality, intermediate scale spatial variation and land uses on living testate amoebae assemblages in natural, forested and restored peatlands. We expected the effects of seasonality on testate amoebae communities to be less pronounced than those of land use and within site variation. On average, natural sites harboured the highest richness and density, while the lowest numbers were found at forestry sites. Despite small changes observed in taxa dominance and differences in TA community structure between seasons and years at some sites, spatial heterogeneity, temperature, pH, nor water table depth seemed to significantly affect testate amoebae communities. Instead, observed differences were related to type of land use, which explained 75% of the community variation. Our results showed that testate amoebae community monitoring is a useful tool to evaluate impacts of human land use on boreal peatlands.

AB Blanket peatlands constitute a rare ecosystem on a global scale, but blanket peatland is the most important peatland type on the British Isles. Most long-term peatland development models have focussed on peat bogs and high-latitude regions. Here, we present a process-based 2-D hillslope model to simulate long-term blanket peatland development along complex hillslope topographies. To calibrate the model, the peatland architecture was assessed along 56 hillslope transects in the headwaters of the river Dee (633 km(2)) in eastern Scotland, resulting in a dataset of 866 soil profile descriptions. The application of the calibrated model using local pollen-based land cover and regional climate reconstructions (mean annual temperature and mean monthly precipitation) over the last 12 000 years shows that the Early Holocene peatland development was largely driven by a temperature increase. An increase in woodland cover only has a slight positive effect on the peat growth potential contradicting the hypothesis that blanket peatland developed as a response to deforestation. Both the hillslope measurements and the model simulations demonstrate that the blanket peatland cover in the study area is highly variable both in extent and peat thickness stressing the need for spatially distributed peatland modelling. At the landscape scale, blanket peatlands were an important atmospheric carbon sink during the period 9.5-6 kyr BP. However, during the last 6000 years, the blanket peatlands were in a state of dynamic equilibrium with minor changes in the carbon balance.

AB In ombrotrophic peatlands, the moisture content of the vadose zone (acrotelm) controls oxygen diffusion rates, redox state, and the turnover of organic matter. Whether peatlands act as sinks or sources of atmospheric carbon thus relies on variably saturated flow processes. The Richards equation is the standard model for water flow in soils, but it is not clear whether it can be applied to simulate water flow in live Sphagnum moss. Transient laboratory evaporation experiments were conducted to observe evaporative water fluxes in the acrotelm, containing living Sphagnum moss, and a deeper layer containing decomposed moss peat. The experimental data were evaluated by inverse modeling using the Richards equation as process model for variably-saturated flow. It was tested whether water fluxes and time series of measured pressure heads during evaporation could be simulated. The results showed that the measurements could be matched very well providing the hydraulic properties are represented by a suitable model. For this, a trimodal parametrization of the underlying pore-size distribution was necessary which reflects three distinct pore systems of the Sphagnum constituted by inter-, intra-, and inner-plant water. While the traditional van Genuchten-Mualem model led to great discrepancies, the physically more comprehensive Peters-Durner-Iden model which accounts for capillary and noncapillary flow, led to a more consistent description of the observations. We conclude that the Richards equation is a valid process description for variably saturated moisture fluxes over a wide pressure range in peatlands supporting the conceptualization of the live moss as part of the vadose zone.

AB This study evaluated the contribution of different ages of foliage to the nutrient and carbon balance of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) from a nutrient-poor peatland in Alberta. Seasonal patterns of foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentration and content were examined in six needle cohorts up to 10 years old. Trees were treated to simulate excess nutrient deficiency (removal of all one-year-old foliage), nutrient excess (fertilized with 250, 50, 100 kg ha-1 NPK split application in June and July), or left as controls. Gas exchange (net assimilation-Na, stomatal conductance-g(s), mesophyll conductance-g(m), water-use efficiency-WUE, dark respiration-RS) was measured on six different needle cohorts in several control trees in 1989 and 1990. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentration decreased with needle age. Foliar nutrient concentration fell from April to June and then was stable until September except for the fertilized trees where it increased. There was no evidence of greater than normal retranslocation of nutrients from older needles for defoliated trees or greater than normal nutrient loading in older needles of fertilized trees. NA, g(s), g(m), WUE, and RS were similar for all needles up to six or eight years old, these older needles having NA of 65% of current needles and similar RS. The results do not support to conclusion that older needles of black spruce are retained as an adaptation to nutrient stress. It does not appear that older needles serve as a nutrient storage site in conditions of excess nutrient availability or a greater than normal nutrient source during times of excess nutrient deficiency. It appears that the maintenance of long-lived foliage in black spruce does not provide for greater flexibility in tree nutrient allocation. Their contribution to the carbon balance of the tree seems to be sufficient to explain their retention.

AB Ecosystem services have become an important concept in policy-making. Carbon (C) sequestration into ecosystems is a significant ecosystem service, whereas C losses can be considered as an ecosystem disservice. Municipalities are in a position to make decisions that affect local emissions and therefore are important when considering greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Integrated estimations of fluxes at a regional level help local authorities to develop land use policies for minimising GHG emissions and maximising C sinks. In this study, the Finnish national GHG accounting system is modified and applied at the municipal level by combining emissions and sinks from agricultural land, forest areas, water bodies and mires (land use-related GHG emissions) with emissions from activities such as energy production and traffic (anthropogenic GHG emissions) into the LUONNIKAS calculation tool. The study area consists of 14 municipalities within the Vanajavesi catchment area located in Southern Finland. In these municipalities, croplands, peat extraction sites, water bodies and undrained mires are emission sources, whereas forests are large carbon sinks that turn the land use-related GHG budget negative, resulting in C sequestration into the ecosystem. The annual land use-related sink in the study area was 78 t CO2 eq km(-2) and 2.8 t CO2 eq per capita. Annual anthropogenic GHG emissions from the area amounted to 250 t CO2 eq km(-2) and 9.2 t CO2 eq per capita. Since forests are a significant carbon sink and the efficiency of this sink is heavily affected by forest management practices, forest management policy is a key contributing factor for mitigating municipal GHG emissions.

AB Peatlands contain a large belowground carbon (C) stock in the biosphere, and their dynamics have important implications for the global carbon cycle. However, there are still large uncertainties in C stock estimates and poor understanding of C dynamics across timescales. Here I review different approaches and associated uncertainties of C stock estimates in the literature, and on the basis of the literature review my best estimate of C stocks and uncertainty is 500+/-100 (approximate range) gigatons of C (GtC) in northern peatlands. The greatest source of uncertainty for all the approaches is the lack or insufficient representation of data, including depth, bulk density and carbon accumulation data, especially from the world's large peatlands. Several ways to improve estimates of peat carbon stocks are also discussed in this paper, including the estimates of C stocks by regions and further utilizations of widely available basal peat ages.
   Changes in peatland carbon stocks over time, estimated using Sphagnum (peat moss) spore data and down-core peat accumulation records, show different patterns during the Holocene, and I argue that spore-based approach underestimates the abundance of peatlands in their early histories. Considering long-term peat decomposition using peat accumulation data allows estimates of net carbon sequestration rates by peatlands, or net (ecosystem) carbon balance (NECB), which indicates more than half of peat carbon (> 270 Gt C) was sequestrated before 7000 yr ago during the Holocene. Contemporary carbon flux studies at 5 peatland sites show much larger NECB during the last decade (32+/-7.8 (S.E.) g Cm-2 yr(-1)) than during the last 7000 yr (+/-11 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), as modeled from peat records across northern peatlands. This discrepancy highlights the urgent need for carbon accumulation data and process understanding, especially at decadal and centennial timescales, that would bridge current knowledge gaps and facilitate comparisons of NECB across all timescales.

AB Peat excavation has altered carbon balance in large areas in the Northern Hemisphere and turned peatlands from CO2 sinks to CO2 sources. Peatland restoration aims at mitigating that situation by supporting CO2 uptake in these areas through raising the water table, in this way creating conditions for vegetation development and organic matter accumulation. We analysed the relationships between recovering vegetation and CO2 fluxes on three abandoned peat excavation sites in northern Estonia, which were rewetted and restored using the moss-layer-transfer technique three to ten years before the first measurements. Using chamber measurements, we determined whether these sites were CO2 sinks or sources during two growing seasons in 2015 (drier) and 2016 (wetter). In the drier growing season, all sites were CO2 sources from the peatland to the atmosphere (emissions from 1 to 77 g CO2 m(-2)), while in the wetter growing season, two sites were CO2 sinks (uptake from 13 to 210 g CO2 m(-2)). CO2 uptake was higher with higher plant and Eriophorum vaginatum cover, and biomass and cover of Sphagnum. The remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) explained about 25% of variation in Net Ecosystem Exchange; CO2 uptake was higher in plots with higher NDVI values. This provides a potential avenue of investigation of developing remote sensing methods in assessing spatial pattern of CO2 fluxes in restored peatlands. In order to increase CO2 uptake in abandoned milled peatlands, it is essential to raise the water level and thus reduce peat oxidation and create conditions for the development of vegetation similar to pristine peatlands.

AB Peatlands still suffer from the scarcity of available data about the characterization and the response to climate forcing of the main oxidative enzymes that occur over the seasons. In the present study, phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities were examined in Sphagnum lawns along a narrow fen-bog gradient under experimental elevated temperatures. We showed that peroxidase activities from Sphagnum mosses were 1000-fold higher than those of phenoloxidases irrespective of seasons and sampling areas. Peroxidase activities increased (+30%) with the rise of air temperatures (an average of 1 degrees C), while warming did not alter phenoloxidase activities. These results suggest that the monitoring of peroxidase activities in peatlands may represent a suitable and forward indicator of the impact of climate warming on carbon cycle in peatlands.

AB Wetlands comprise 14% of the land area of Canada. They have considerable impact on water storage and runoff, water quality, atmospheric exchanges of carbon, and important elements such as nitrogen. In less remote parts of Canada, wetlands have suffered from reclamation, exploitation, contamination and degradation, which have seriously impaired their ecological function. Public recognition of their environmental significance has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the hydrological processes, to better plan and manage wetland areas, restore degraded systems, and predict responses to global change. This paper reviews current hydrological research in all types of Canadian wetlands. The scope of hydrological processes discussed herein includes runoff, surface and groundwater flows, evaporation, microclimate, water balance, geochemical and solute transport phenomenon, carbon dynamics, isotope studies, exploitation and restoration.

AB The provenance of sediments and particulate organic carbon (POC) in the Colville River delta and adjacent Simpson's Lagoon, in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, was investigated using a variety of bulk and molecular techniques, including stable and radiocarbon isotopes, neodymium isotopes, algal pigments, and lignin-phenols. Additionally, stable carbon isotopes and lignin-phenols were analyzed on four different density fractions from sediments. The Colville River, the largest river in North America with a watershed exclusively located in the high-Arctic tundra, was an important source of terrestrial POC to the western edge of the Lagoon, shown by extremely old radiocarbon ages (fraction modern of 0.1650.001 close to the river mouth up to 0.4180.002 farther away). Stations without northern protective barrier islands had large amounts of marine POC input, and evidence of benthic microalgae was found in one area of the Lagoon (chlorophyll-a concentration 35.0 mu g gOC(-1) in the high-algal biomass area compared to 1 to 7 mu g gOC(-1) outside of it). Stations in the middle and eastern end of the Lagoon showed significant sediment input from coastal erosion (input of peat-indicating non-lignin-phenols 0.079 mg (100mgOC)(-1) in the eastern lagoon compared to 0.022 mg (100mgOC)(-1) near the Colville delta), and on the eastern end of the Lagoon there was evidence of input of Mackenzie River POC, shown with neodymium isotopes and also COP. POC inputs derived from rivers, coastal erosion, and marine productivity were quantified using a ternary mixing model and showed that fluvial supply and coastal erosion were the dominant carbon sources to the Lagoon. This constitutes the first study of POC delivery by the Colville River into a nearshore region and illustrates that continued warming of the high Arctic tundra will likely lead to increased riverine POC delivery to this region of the world.

AB Sphagnum mosses are the dominant species of natural peatlands, which are important in the global carbon cycle. There is increasing interest in the use of sensors mounted on satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles in association with management of the ecological resources of peatlands, e.g. for monitoring purposes. Since Sphagnum mosses grow with many other vascular plants in the same habitat, the spectral signals of Sphagnum moss pixels in the remote sensing image are mixed, so investigation of their spectral characteristics forms a basis for remote sensing of peatlands. In this study, the spectral characteristics of Sphagnum magellanicum Brid were analysed at various levels (field and laboratory hyperspectral, laboratory plant physiology, satellite sensors) and compared with those of other plants, in order to examine the potential for developing remote sensing methods to distinguish Sphagnum. The results showed that: (1) the unique spectral characteristics of S. magellanicum that might be used to distinguish it from other plants are located in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared (NIR-SWIR; 760-2400 nm) region of the reflectance spectrum, and especially in the two water absorption bands (980 and 1150 nm); (2) the cell structure of S. magellanicum (which is the basis of its large water-holding capacity) explains the very low reflectance in the NIR-SWIR and the sensitivity of reflectance in the IR to moisture; and (3) the identification of Sphagnum from satellite remote sensing data should be based on sensors which have more infrared channels such as Sentinel-2A MSI, and on vegetation indices established in the NIR-SWIR such as MSI (moisture stress index) and NDII (normalised difference infrared index).

AB Increasing atmospheric CO2 is likely to produce chronic changes in global climate, as it may have done in the geologic past. Future CO2-induced changes in temperature and precipitation distribution changes could equal or exceed the changes which have occurred over the past 160,000 years and have affected the global carbon cycle. We consider ocean and terrestrial processes that could involve large changes in carbon fluxes (> 2 Pg C.yr-1) or changes in storage in large carbon pools (> 200 Pg C) resulting from CO2-induced climate changes. These include (1) air-sea exchange of CO2 in response to changes in temperature and salinity; (2) climate-induced changes in ocean circulation; (3) changes in oceanic new production and regeneration of organic debris caused directly by climate change; (4) altered oceanic nutrient supply needed to support new production due to climate-induced alteration of ocean circulation and river discharge; (5) CaCO3 compensation in sea water; (6) altered river nutrient flux and effects on coastal organic matter production and sediment accumulation; (7) seasonal balance between GPP and decomposition-respiration in terrestrial ecosystems in response to changes in temperature and precipitation; (8) successional processes in terrestrial ecosystems and formation of new plant associations in response to climatic change; (9) effects on soil nutrient availability, which amplifies ecosystem responses to climate change; (10) and responses of northern forests, tundra, and peatlands which have, until recently, been a sink for CO2. The potential effect of these processes on the rate of atmospheric CO2 concentration changes are estimated where possible, but not much quantitative information at a global scale is known, so uncertainty in these estimates is high. Each of these secondary feedbacks, however, has the potential of changing atmospheric CO2 concentration in magnitude similar to the effects of the direct human processes (fossil fuel burning and land clearing) responsible for the concern about global warming in the first place. It is therefore urgent that these uncertainties be resolved. Lines of research to accomplish this are suggested.

AB Forest fires are a significant and natural element of the circumboreal forest. Fire activity is strongly linked to weather, and increased fire activity due to climate change is anticipated or arguably has already occurred. Recent studies suggest a doubling of area burned along with a 50% increase in fire occurrence in parts of the circumboreal by the end of this century. Fire management agencies' ability to cope with these increases in fire activity is limited, as these organizations operate with a narrow margin between success and failure; a disproportionate number of fires may escape initial attack under a warmer climate, resulting in an increase in area burned that will be much greater than the corresponding increase in fire weather severity. There may be only a decade or two before increased fire activity means fire management agencies cannot maintain their current levels of effectiveness.

AB Thicker snowpacks and their insulation effects cause winter-warming and invoke thaw of permafrost ecosystems. Temperature-dependent decomposition of previously frozen carbon (C) is currently considered one of the strongest feedbacks between the Arctic and the climate system, but the direction and magnitude of the net C balance remains uncertain. This is because winter effects are rarely integrated with C fluxes during the snow-free season and because predicting the net C balance from both surface processes and thawing deep layers remains challenging. In this study, we quantified changes in the long-term net C balance (net ecosystem production) in a subarctic peat plateau subjected to 10 years of experimental winter-warming. By combining(210)Pb and(14)Cdating of peat cores with peat growth models, we investigated thawing effects on year-round primary production and C losses through respiration and leaching from both shallow and deep peat layers. Winter-warming and permafrost thaw had no effect on the net C balance, but strongly affected gross C fluxes. Carbon losses through decomposition from the upper peat were reduced as thawing of permafrost induced surface subsidence and subsequent waterlogging. However, primary production was also reduced likely due to a strong decline in bryophytes cover while losses from the old C pool almost tripled, caused by the deepened active layer. Our findings highlight the need to estimate long-term responses of whole-year production and decomposition processes to thawing, both in shallow and deep soil layers, as they may contrast and lead to unexpected net effects on permafrost C storage.

AB Here we investigate the vegetation history and peat accumulation at the eastern boarder of the West Siberian Plain, near the Yenisey River, south of permafrost. In this region, peat started to accumulate 15 000 years ago as gyttja of shallow lakes in ancient river valleys. This peat is older than previously reported, mainly due to separating particulate organic carbon (POC) from dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which was 1900-6500 years younger than POC. The probability of finding peat layers older than 12 000 years is about 2 %. Peat accumulated as fen peat at a constant rate of 0.2 mm yr(-1) and 0.01 kg C m(-2) yr(-1). The accumulation was higher in ancient river valley environments. Over the last 2000 years these bogs changed into Sphagnum mires which have accumulated up to about 0.1 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) until present.
   The long-lasting fen stage, which makes the Yenisey bogs distinct from the western Siberian bogs, is discussed as a consequence of the local hydrology. The high accumulation rate of peat in unfrozen mires is taken as an indication that thawing of permafrost peat may also change northern peatlands into long-lasting carbon sinks.

AB 1 Above-ground biomass was measured at bog hummock, bog hollow and poor-fen sites in Mer Bleue, a large, raised ombrotrophic bog near Ottawa, Ont., Canada. The average above-ground biomass was 587 g m(-2) in the bog, composed mainly of shrubs and Sphagnum capitula. In the poor fen, the average biomass was 317 g m(2), comprising mainly sedges and herbs and Sphagnum capitula. Vascular plant above-ground biomass was greater where the water table was lower, with a similar but weaker relationship for Sphagnum capitula and vascular leaf biomass. 2 Below-ground biomass averaged 2400 g m(2) at the bog hummock site, of which 300 g m(2) was fine roots (<2 mm diameter), compared with 1400 g m 2 in hollows (fine roots 450 g m(2)) and 1200 g m(2) at the poor-fen site. 3 Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) Of CO2 was measured in chambers and used to derive ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis. Under high light flux (PAR of 1500 mu mol m(2) s(1)), NEE ranged across sites from 0.08 to 0.22 mg m(2) s(1) (a positive value indicates ecosystem uptake) in the spring and summer, but fell to -0.01 to -0.13 mg m(-2) s(1) (i.e. a release of CO2) during a late-summer dry period. 4 There was a general agreement between a combination of literature estimates of photosynthetic capacity for shrubs and mosses and measured biomass and summertime CO2 uptake determined by the eddy covariance technique within a bog footprint (0.40 and 0.35-0.40 mg m(2) s(1), respectively). 5 Gross photosynthesis was estimated to be about 530 g m(2) year(1), total respiration 460 g m(-2) year(1), and export of DOC, DIC and CH4 10 g m(2) year(1), leaving an annual C sequestration rate of 60 g m(-2) year(1). Root production and decomposition are important parts of the C budget of the bog. Root C production was estimated to be 161-176 g m(2) year(1), resulting in fractional turnover rates of 0.2 and 1 year(1) for total and fine roots, respectively.

AB At the northern tip of the remnant Everglades, Water Conservation Area 1 is the only remaining softwater peatland in the ecosystem. The spatial pattern of altered hydrology, anthropogenic nutrient, and mineral enrichment is distinct, with biogeochemical processes driven by a north-south hydrologic gradient combined with west-east nutrient and mineral gradients. Hydrology effects on carbon cycling are evident by the 10-20% lower average soil carbon concentrations in the drier oxidizing regions of the north, compared with the ponded environment in the south. Elevated nutrient and mineral inputs also increase carbon loss by causing changes in species composition, substrate quality, and microbial activity. Water management may be optimized to limit mineral intrusion and peat oxidation, while also meeting water depth requirements for habitat and wildlife, such that ecological tradeoffs are minimized.

AB The ability of Trichoderma strains isolated from lignite and of Earth surface-derived strains to attack (solubilise) lignite, peat and wood was compared using glutamate as a carbon source. The results showed that lignite-derived microorganisms solubilise lignite to similar extent as Trichoderma strains isolated from the Earth surface. Solubilisation processes involve the action of enzymes and alkaline pH. The solubilisation of lignite was accompanied by a small increase of conidia-bound laccase, whereas that of peat was accompanied by (secretion) activity of cellulase, laminarinase, laccase, and lignin-peroxidase-like enzyme. In addition, data were obtained which show that bacteria contained in the lignite are able of lignite solubilisation and utilisation.

AB The vast amount of organic carbon (OC) stored in soils of the northern circumpolar permafrost region is a potentially vulnerable component of the global carbon cycle. However, estimates of the quantity, decomposability, and combustibility of OC contained in permafrost-region soils remain highly uncertain, thereby limiting our ability to predict the release of greenhouse gases due to permafrost thawing. Substantial differences exist between empirical and modeling estimates of the quantity and distribution of permafrost-region soil OC, which contribute to large uncertainties in predictions of carbon-climate feedbacks under future warming. Here, we identify research challenges that constrain current assessments of the distribution and potential decomposability of soil OC stocks in the northern permafrost region and suggest priorities for future empirical and modeling studies to address these challenges.

AB Since 1988, there has been, on average, a 91% increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of UK lakes and streams in the Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN). Similar DOC increases have been observed in surface waters across much of Europe and North America. Much of the debate about the causes of rising DOC has, as in other studies relating to the carbon cycle, focused on factors related to climate change. Data from our peat-core experiments support an influence of climate on DOC, notably an increase in production with temperature under aerobic, and to a lesser extent anaerobic, conditions. However, we argue that climatic factors may not be the dominant drivers of DOC change. DOC solubility is suppressed by high soil water acidity and ionic strength, both of which have decreased as a result of declining sulphur deposition since the 1980s, augmented during the 1990s in the United Kingdom by a cyclical decline in sea-salt deposition. Our observational and experimental data demonstrate a clear, inverse and quantitatively important link between DOC and sulphate concentrations in soil solution. Statistical analysis of 11 AWMN lakes suggests that rising temperature, declining sulphur deposition and changing sea-salt loading can account for the majority of the observed DOC trend. This combination of evidence points to the changing chemical composition of atmospheric deposition, particularly the substantial reduction in anthropogenic sulphur emissions during the last 20 years, as a key cause of rising DOC. The implications of rising DOC export for the carbon cycle will be very different if linked primarily to decreasing acid deposition, rather than to changes in climate, suggesting that these systems may be recovering rather than destabilising.

AB To constrain the effect of climate and peatland type on carbon accumulation, we reconstructed these parameters from a Holocene-length core of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland near Cordova, AK, USA. We determined peat type using a combination of peat texture and density, macrofossils, distributions of leaf-wax biomarkers, and soil pH reconstructions based on distributions of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (brGDGTs). We produced an independent record of hydroclimate and temperature change using hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf-wax biomarkers and distributions of brGDGTs. Carbon accumulation rates were constrained with 14 AMS C-14 dates from identified macrofossils and ash-free bulk density. In the early Holocene, the site was a shallow pond with evidence for emergent macrophytes, Sphagnum, and algae growing in a warm, moist climate. At 9.2 kyr (1 kyr = 1000 cal. yr BP), the site became a Sphagnum-dominated bog. Under mid-Holocene warm, evaporative climate conditions, the site became sedge-dominated. As climate cooled and effective precipitation increased, Sphagnum was able to gain dominance abruptly at similar to 3.5 kyr. Large changes in the vegetation assemblage and hydrology and climate are contemporaneous with significant changes in the rate of carbon accumulation. Carbon accumulated most rapidly when Sphagnum dominated and effective moisture was high and most slowly when sedges were dominant and conditions were warmer and drier. Estimates of future climate change indicate warmer, more evaporative conditions that, in the past, favored a sedge-dominated environment, suggesting that this peatland and those similar can contribute to a positive feedback to warming by transitioning to less efficient carbon sinks.

AB This study comparing the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in natural, restored, and naturally regenerated peatlands assesses the significance of peatland restoration as a global biotic offset under the Kyoto Protocol. Maximum gross photosynthesis (GP) at the restored peatland (-17.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) was more than two times that at lawns in the natural peatland (-8.2 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) and almost three times that of the naturally regenerated peatland (-6.5 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)). However, GP(max) at hummock sites (-18.1 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) in the natural peatland exceeded that of the restored peatland. Total rainfall during the study period was similar to 75% of the 30-year mean and these drier conditions resulted in all sites being a net source of atmospheric CO2 during the summer. From May 5 to August 23, 1998 respiration followed the trend: mined (398 g C m(-2)) > restored (169 g C m(-2)) > natural (138 g C m(-2)) peatland. While restoration did not return the net carbon sink function, it resulted in a significant decrease in the source of atmospheric CO2 (229 g C m(-2)) over the summer season. Approximately 70% of this decrease was due to the increase in gross ecosystem production, while the remaining 30% was due to a decrease in total respiration. The presence of Sphagnum mosses at the naturally regenerated peatland also resulted in a similar to 45% decrease in total respiration (soil and plants), indicating that an increase in volumetric soil moisture content during restoration has the potential to lower soil respiration at abandoned mined peatlands. Considering the area of drained and mined peatlands globally, peatland restoration on abandoned mined peatlands has the potential to represent an important biotic offset through enhanced carbon sequestration.

AB The large reservoir of organic carbon in peatland is essential for the global carbon cycle. Laccase, probably the largest class of phenol oxidases in soil, plays an important role in the primary degradation of recalcitrant polyphenolic compounds. However, the traditional method used to test laccase activity may not be suitable for peatland, given that reductive compounds would result in the reduction of chromophore 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation catalyzed by laccase. In this study, the organic and inorganic constituents affecting laccase activity assay in peatland were systematically studied. The experiments indicated that high content of ferrous iron in peatland can significantly affect the measurement of laccase activity by delaying the ABTS(center dot+) absorbance dynamic inflection point, and three typical dynamic changes of ABTS(center dot+) absorbance in Dajiuhu peat samples were found. In this study, we propose a novel method based on delay dynamics (MDD) to determine laccase activity in peatland and applied it to the investigation of Dajiuhu, a Sphagnum-dominated peatland. The results show that the laccase activities measured using MDD (24.45 +/- 10.89 mu mol g(-1).h(-1)) are considerably higher than that measured by the traditional method (12.10 +/- 12.06 mu mol g(-1).h(-1)) in Dajiuhu peatland. In addition, there was no clear evidence that ferrous iron can stimulate laccase activity. Conversely, we found that ferrous iron can even inhibit the catalytic efficiency of laccase. Laccase activities were higher at the depth of 0-10 cm (31.12 +/- 13.36 mu mol g(-1).h(-1)) compared with that at 10-20 cm (18.88 +/- 5.67 mu mol g(-1).h(-1) ), suggesting the sub-optimal conditions for laccase activity with increasing depth in Sphagnum-dominated peatland. In addition, laccase activities decreased significantly with pH increase in Dajiuhu peatland, which is different from the generally positive relationship between soil pH and phenol oxidase activities tested by L-DOPA assay.

AB Wildfires are a common feature of peatland environments, but the carbon balance of these wildfires is often not considered and the production of refractory black carbon in these wildfires could be an important addition to carbon accumulation and mitigate losses of biomass during the fire. This study investigates the biomass and carbon losses during a moorland wildfire. Changes in above-ground carbon stocks were calculated using a combination of field data, laboratory measurements and literature values. The results show that approximately 14% of the carbon in the original above-ground biomass remained on the site after the burn. Black carbon production was approximately 6 gC m(-2) which constituted 4.3% of the biomass lost. The survival of biomass and black carbon may help to mitigate the loss of carbon during the fire.

AB Nitrogen (N) is a scarce nutrient commonly limiting primary productivity. Microbial decomposition of complex carbon (C) into small organic molecules (e.g., free amino acids) has been suggested to supplement biologically fixed N in northern peatlands. We evaluated the microbial (fungal, bacterial, and archaeal) genetic potential for organic N depolymerization in peatlands at Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in northern Minnesota. We used guided gene assembly to examine the abundance and diversity of protease genes and further compared them to those of N fixation (nifH) genes in shotgun metagenomic data collected across depths and in two distinct peatland environments (bogs and fens). Microbial protease genes greatly outnumbered nifH genes, with the most abundant genes (archaeal M1 and bacterial trypsin [S01]) each containing more sequences than all sequences attributed to nifH. Bacterial protease gene assemblies were diverse and abundant across depth profiles, indicating a role for bacteria in releasing free amino acids from peptides through depolymerization of older organic material and contrasting with the paradigm of fungal dominance in depolymerization in forest soils. Although protease gene assemblies for fungi were much less abundant overall than those for bacteria, fungi were prevalent in surface samples and therefore may be vital in degrading large soil polymers from fresh plant inputs during the early stage of depolymerization. In total, we demonstrate that depolymerization enzymes from a diverse suite of microorganisms, including understudied bacterial and archaeal lineages, are prevalent within northern peatlands and likely to influence C and N cycling.
   IMPORTANCE Nitrogen (N) is a common limitation on primary productivity, and its source remains unresolved in northern peatlands that are vulnerable to environmental change. Decomposition of complex organic matter into free amino acids has been proposed as an important N source, but the genetic potential of microorganisms mediating this process has not been examined. Such information can inform possible responses of northern peatlands to environmental change. We show high genetic potential for microbial production of free amino acids across a range of microbial guilds in northern peatlands. In particular, the abundance and diversity of bacterial genes encoding proteolytic activity suggest a predominant role for bacteria in regulating productivity and contrasts with a paradigm of fungal dominance of organic N decomposition. Our results expand our current understanding of coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles in northern peatlands and indicate that understudied bacterial and archaeal lineages may be central in this ecosystem's response to environmental change.

AB Large areas of naturally open peatland in western Europe were drained and planted with non-native conifers in the twentieth century. Efforts arc currently underway to restore many of these sites. Ultimately, forest-to-bog restoration aims to bring back functional peatlands that can sequester carbon but there is a lack of empirical evidence for whether current approaches are effective. Using a chronosequence design, we compared the annual gaseous carbon balance of two forest-to-bog restoration areas with an open area not subject to afforestation. A closed chamber method was used to determine gas fluxes (Net Ecosystem Respiration, Gross Primary Productivity, Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and methane (CH4)) over a twelve-month period for locations spanning the range of peatland microtopography and vegetation communities. Relationships between gas fluxes, vegetation/ cover and environmental factors were analysed and regression models used to estimate annual CO2 and CH4 budgets. During the study period, NEE estimates (total gaseous C expressed as CO2-eq) showed a net sink for the unafforested (-102 g C M-2 yr(-1)) and oldest ( -131 g C M-2 yr(-1)) restoration area (17 years post-restoration 'RES 17 YRS'), whilst the youngest restoration area (6 years post-restoration 'RES 6YRS'), was a net source (35 g C m(-2) yr (-1)). We observed significantly higher CH4 emissions from restoration areas dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium compared with other peatland vegetation types. Sampling points with higher cover of Sphagnum were found to be most effective for C sequestration. Overall, vegetation composition/cover was observed to be an important factor determining C emissions from forest-to-bog restoration areas. These results suggest that restoration is effective in returning the carbon sink function of peatlands damaged by commercial forestry and - depending on restoration techniques - timescales of >10 years may be required.

AB Quantifying the sink strength of northern hemisphere peatlands requires measurements or realistic estimates of all major C flux terms. Whilst assessments of the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) routinely include annual measurements of net ecosystem exchange and lateral fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), they rarely include estimates of evasion (degassing) of CO2 and CH4 from the water surface to the atmosphere, despite supersaturation being a consistent feature of peatland streams. Instantaneous gas exchange measurements from temperate UK peatland streams suggest that the CO2 evasion fluxes scaled to the whole catchment are a significant component of the aquatic C flux (23.3 +/- A 6.9 g C m(-2) catchment y(-1)) and comparable in magnitude to the downstream DOC flux (29.1 +/- A 12.9 g C m(-2) catchment y(-1)). Inclusion of the evasion flux term in the NECB would be justified if evaded CO2 and CH4 were isotopically "young" and derived from a "within-ecosystem" source, such as peat or in-stream processing of DOC. Derivation from "old" biogenic or geogenic sources would indicate a separate origin and age of C fixation, disconnected from the ecosystem accumulation rate that the NECB definition implies. Dual isotope analysis (delta C-13 and C-14) of evasion CO2 and DOC strongly suggest that the source and age of both are different and that evasion CO2 is largely derived from allochthonous (non-stream) sources. Whilst evasion is an important flux term relative to the other components of the NECB, isotopic data suggest that its source and age are peatland-specific. Evidence suggests that a component of the CO2-C evading from stream surfaces was originally fixed from the atmosphere at a significantly earlier time (pre-AD1955) than modern (post-AD1955) C fixation by photosynthesis.

AB Eddy covariance measurements of methane flux were carried out in an arctic tundra landscape in the central Lena River Delta at 72 degrees N. The measurements covered the seasonal course of mid-summer to early winter in 2003 and early spring to mid-summer in 2004, including the periods of spring thaw and autumnal freeze back. The study site is characterized by very cold and deep permafrost and a continental climate with a mean annual air temperature of -14.7 degrees C. The surface is characterized by wet polygonal tundra, with a micro-relief consisting of raised moderately dry sites, depressed wet sites, polygonal ponds, and lakes. We found relatively low fluxes of typically 30 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) during mid-summer and identified soil temperature and near-surface atmospheric turbulence as the factors controlling methane emission. The influence of atmospheric turbulence was attributed to the high coverage of open water surfaces in the tundra. The soil thaw depth and water table position were found to have no clear effect on methane fluxes. The excess emission during spring thaw was estimated to be about 3% of the total flux measured during June-October. Winter emissions were modeled based on the functional relationships found in the measured data. The annual methane emission was estimated to be 3.15 g m(-2). This is low compared with values reported for similar ecosystems. Reason for this were thought to be the very low permafrost temperature in the study region, the sandy soil texture and low bio-availability of nutrients in the soils, and the high surface coverage of moist to dry micro-sites. The methane emission accounted for about 14% of the annual ecosystem carbon balance. Considering the global warming potential of methane, the methane emission turned the tundra into an effective greenhouse gas source.

AB [ 1] Coastal wetlands are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, the dynamics of carbon ( C) cycling in coastal wetlands and its response to sea level change associated with global warming is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the long-term and short-term rates of C accumulation, using C and C isotopic measurements of peat cores collected along a soil chronosequence, in a coastal wetland in north Florida. The long-term C accumulation rates determined by examining the C inventory and the radioactive decay of radiocarbon as a function of depth in the peat cores decrease with time from -130 +/- 9 g C/m(2)/yr over the last century to -13 +/- 2 g C/m(2)/yr over the millennium timescale. The short-term C accumulation rates estimated by examining the differences in the radiocarbon and C contents of the surfacial peat between archived ( 1985, 1988) and present ( 1996 and 1997) samples range from 42 to 193 g C/m(2)/yr in low marsh, from 18 to 184 g C/m(2)/yr in middle marsh, and from -50 to 181 g C/m(2)/yr in high marsh. The high end-values of our estimated short-term C accumulation rates are comparable to the estimated rates of C sequestration in coastal wetlands reported by Chmura et al. [ 2003], but are significantly higher than our estimated long-term rates in the marshes and are also much higher than the published rates of C sequestration in northern peatlands. The higher recent rates of C accumulation in coastal marshes, in comparison with the longer-term rates, are due to slow but continuous decomposition of organic matter in the peat over time. However, other factors such as increased primary production in the coastal wetland over the last decades or century, due to a rise in mean sea level and/or CO2 and nitrogen fertilization effect, could also have contributed to the large difference between the recent and longer-term rates. Our data indicate that salt marshes in this area have been and continue to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of higher rates of C sequestration and lower CH4 emissions, coastal wetlands could be more valuable C sinks per unit area than other ecosystems in a warmer world.

AB Investigating the spatial and vertical patterns of wetland soil organic carbon concentration (SOCc) is important for understanding the regional carbon cycle and managing the wetland ecosystem. By integrating 160 wetland soil profile samples and environmental variables from climatic, topographical, and remote sensing data, we spatially predicted the SOCc of wetlands in China's Western Songnen Plain by comparing four algorithms: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) for regression, inverse distance weighted (IDW), and ordinary kriging (OK). The predicted results of the SOCc from the different algorithms were validated against independent testing samples according to the mean error, root mean squared error, and correlation coefficient. The results show that the measured SOCc values at depths of 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm were 15.28, 7.57, and 5.22 g.kg(-1), respectively. An assessment revealed that the RF algorithm was the most accurate for predicting SOCc; its correlation coefficients at the different depths were 0.82, 0.59, and 0.51, respectively. The attribute importance from the RF indicates that environmental variables have various effects on the SOCc at different depths. The land surface temperature and land surface water index had a stronger influence on the spatial distribution of SOCc at the depths of 0-30 and 30-60 cm, whereas topographic factors, such as altitude, had a stronger influence within 60-100 cm. The predicted SOCc of each vertical depth increased gradually from south to north in the study area. This research provides an important case study for predicting SOCc, including selecting factors and algorithms, and helps understanding the carbon cycles of regional wetlands.

AB We describe a direct approach to quantifying the amount of organic matter consumed in peatlands during a single fire event, based on differences in ash concentrations between burned peat at the surface of peat cores and underlying unburned peat. We collected six peat cores at each of two continental bog and two permafrost bog sites, 3 months after a March 1999 wildfire. Results suggest high within-site variation in the amount of organic matter burned, with no significant differences between the four peatland sites or between continental and permafrost bogs. Averaged across all sites, 2.2 +/- 0.5 kg C.m(-2) (mean +/- SE, n = 24) of organic matter was consumed as a result of this single fire, a value consistent with those in the literature.

AB Plant community modification may play an important role in peatlands' carbon balance. We investigated how Molinia caerulea altered CO2 and CH4 fluxes and DOC concentration as well as their sensitivity to water table level, air and soil temperature in Sphagnum-dominated peat mesocosms. The presence of Molinia caerulea significantly increased CO2 and CH4 emissions compared to Sphagnum and decreased the DOC concentration. The rise in temperature exponentially increased DOC as well as CO2 and CH4 emissions. Molinia caerulea decreased the temperature sensitivity of CO2 emissions, suggesting the presence of a more labile substrate (root exudates), while it increased the temperature sensitivity of CH4 emissions, suggesting a possible change in methanogenic communities. Our study highlights a strong impact of vegetation change on C dynamics in peatlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fire history and the effect of fires on the long-term (apparent) rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) in the Patvinsuo mire complex, eastern Finland, were determined through stratigraphic and pollen analyses of 98 pear cores. The peat cores were characterized by a large number of charcoal layers and the age of the basal peat varied between 57 and 10 500 years. Mire fires slowed down the progress of vertical peat accumulation and resulted in great carbon losses. The average LORCA in the Patvinsuo cores was clearly lower, 9.2 +/- 1.0 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1), compared to the average Value for all mire sites in the southern half of Finland, 17.7 +/- 0.6 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1). The average rate of carbon loss in Patvinsuo mire complex was 9.5 +/- 1.0 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1) and the mean carbon loss in an individual fire was estimated to be 2.5 kg m(-2).

AB We compared output from 3 dynamic process-based models (DMs: ECOSSE, MILLENNIA and the Durham Carbon Model) and 9 bioclimatic envelope models (BCEMs; including BBOG ensemble and PEATSTASH) ranging from simple threshold to semi-process-based models. Model simulations were run at 4 British peatland sites using historical climate data and climate projections under a medium (A1B) emissions scenario from the 11-RCM (regional climate model) ensemble underpinning UKCP09. The models showed that blanket peatlands are vulnerable to projected climate change; however, predictions varied between models as well as between sites. All BCEMs predicted a shift from presence to absence of a climate associated with blanket peat, where the sites with the lowest total annual precipitation were closest to the presence/absence threshold. DMs showed a more variable response. ECOSSE predicted a decline in net C sink and shift to net C source by the end of this century. The Durham Carbon Model predicted a smaller decline in the net C sink strength, but no shift to net C source. MILLENNIA predicted a slight overall increase in the net C sink. In contrast to the BCEM projections, the DMs predicted that the sites with coolest temperatures and greatest total annual precipitation showed the largest change in carbon sinks. In this model inter-comparison, the greatest variation in model output in response to climate change projections was not between the BCEMs and DMs but between the DMs themselves, because of different approaches to modelling soil organic matter pools and decomposition amongst other processes. The difference in the sign of the response has major implications for future climate feedbacks, climate policy and peatland management. Enhanced data collection, in particular monitoring peatland response to current change, would significantly improve model development and projections of future change.

AB Peatlands are significant carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks and methane (CH4) sources. In this study, we investigated changes in CO2 and CH4 emissions from topsoil (0-20 cm) to subsoil (20-40 cm) in a permafrost peatland, and the related soil microbial abundance in response to increasing temperature and soil water content by using an incubation experiment. Our results indicated that CO2 and CH4 emissions from the permafrost peatland are highly sensitive to temperature and soil water content. CO2 emissions from topsoil and subsoil at 15 degrees C were 3.36 and 2.74 times larger, respectively, compared to those at 5 degrees C under the field moisture condition, and were 1.70 times larger under the waterlogged treatment in both topsoil and subsoil. CH4 emissions from 0-20 to 20-40 cm soils at 15 degrees C were 34 and 83 times larger, respectively, than those at 5 degrees C under the original state and 17 and 32 times larger under the waterlogged treatment. These results indicated that CH4 emissions are more sensitive than CO2 emissions, and waterlogged conditions could decrease temperature sensitivity of CO2 and CH4 emissions. Microbial analyses showed that the cumulative emissions amount of CO2 positively correlated with bacterial, fungal, and methanotroph abundances. Positive relationships were observed between CH4 emissions and abundances of bacteria, fungi, and archaea. These findings suggested that changes in temperature and water content alter CO2 and CH4 emissions from permafrost peatlands through controlling abundances of soil bacteria, fungi, archaea, and methanotrophs. These variables bear importance in accurately estimating C emissions from permafrost peatlands.

AB Among the largest uncertainties in current projections of future climate is the feedback between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate(1). Northern peatlands contain one-third of the world's soil organic carbon, equivalent to more than half the amount of carbon in the atmosphere(2). Climate-warming-induced acceleration of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions through enhanced respiration of thick peat deposits, centuries to millennia old, may form a strong positive carbon cycle-climate feedback. The long-term temperature sensitivity of carbon in peatlands, especially at depth, remains uncertain, however, because of the short duration or correlative nature of field studies(3-5) and the disturbance associated with respiration measurements below the surface in situ or during laboratory incubations(6,7). Here we combine non-disturbing in situ measurements of CO(2) respiration rates and isotopic ((13)C) composition of respired CO(2) in two whole-ecosystem climate-manipulation experiments in a subarctic peatland. We show that approximately 1 degrees C warming accelerated total ecosystem respiration rates on average by 60% in spring and by 52% in summer and that this effect was sustained for at least eight years. While warming stimulated both short-term (plant-related) and longer-term (peat soil-related) carbon respiration processes, we find that at least 69% of the increase in respiration rate originated from carbon in peat towards the bottom (25-50 cm) of the active layer above the permafrost. Climate warming therefore accelerates respiration of the extensive, subsurface carbon reservoirs in peatlands to a much larger extent than was previously thought(6,7). Assuming that our data from a single site are indicative of the direct response to warming of northern peatland soils on a global scale, we estimate that climate warming of about 1 degrees C over the next few decades could induce a global increase in heterotrophic respiration of 38-100 megatonnes of C per year. Our findings suggest a large, long-lasting, positive feedback of carbon stored in northern peatlands to the global climate system.

AB Peatlands are large sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to downstream ecosystems and DOC losses account for an important portion of peatland carbon balance. Disturbance and restoration of peatland ecosystems alters ecohydrological conditions that are likely to affect DOC chemistry in both soil water and discharge, although the direction of change and controls on DOC chemistry post-restoration remain unclear. We investigated DOC chemistry (concentration, SUVA(254), E2:E3, E4:E6, pentose and hexose concentration) during the growing season (May to October) in soil and discharge of a peatland restored for 10 years and compared the results to those measured at neighboring unrestored and natural peatland sites. Controls on the spatial and temporal variability of DOC chemistry, including pH, water table, temperature, plant cover and type, and carbon dioxide and methane flux were also investigated. After 10 years, restoration increased DOC concentration in soils compared to both natural and unrestored sites. This high DOC concentration likely resulted from high plant productivity post-restoration and a mean water table position deeper than the natural site. Ecohydrological conditions were also correlated to DOC chemistry. High vascular plant cover and photosynthesis rates were correlated to lower SUVA(254) and higher pentose concentration, while deeper water table position was correlated to higher E2:E3 and E4:E6. DOC concentration in discharge was lower, and E2:E3 higher, at the restored compared to the unrestored site. Differences in DOC chemistry in discharge water were minimal between the sites except when water was likely sourced from the near surface layer at the restored site, which represents new peat accumulated post-restoration. These results suggest that DOC dynamics 10 years post-restoration remain intermediate between natural and unrestored peatland. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The 'early anthropogenic hypothesis' (EAH), published in 2003, proposed that early agricultural humans transformed planet Earth by adding CO2 to the atmosphere by deforestation after 7000 years ago and by adding CH4 to the atmosphere by wet-rice farming and livestock tending after 5000 years ago. Later work led to the insight that the resulting warming of the atmosphere and the ocean would have contributed additional CO2 feedback by reducing CO2 solubility in the global ocean and by boosting ventilation from the Antarctic Ocean surface due to suppressed Antarctic sea-ice extent. This paper summarizes new findings from multiple scientific disciplines that document how the steadily spreading human influence transformed their environment after 7000 years ago. We blend this new evidence into a revised version of the EAH, and we also evaluate proposed alternatives to the anthropogenic explanation. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PHANEROCHAETE-CHRYSOSPORIUM; DEGRADATION
AB The colonization of sandy loam soil following inoculation with spore suspensions of the white-rot fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 24725 and Chrysosporium lignorum CL1 was confirmed by an epifluorescence microscopy-image analysis method. These fungi and Trametes versicolor PV1 mineralized 3,4-dichloroaniline and benzo(a)pyrene in soil at concentrations up to 250 mug g-1. Successful inoculation and biodegradation required supplementary carbon sources. Addition of inorganic nutrients had no stimulatory effect, Glucose, hay, wood chips, pine bark, loam and peat all promoted growth and degradation but chopped wheat straw was the best substrate.
   Increasing the content of straw in the soil led to increased biomass and mineralization. The optimum ratio of straw: soil for mineralization was 1:4. Both strains sporulated within 7 days of inoculation before a further increase in hyphal growth but this had no effect on the mineralization rate. These results indicate that use of white-rot fungi in biotechnological soil treatment may be feasible.

AB Drained peatlands are hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which could be mitigated by rewetting and land use change. We performed an ecological/economic analysis of rewetting drained fertile peatlands in a hemiboreal climate using different land use strategies over 80 years. Vegetation, soil processes, and total GHG emissions were modeled using the CoupModel for four scenarios: (1) business as usualNorway spruce with average soil water table of -40 cm; (2) willow with groundwater at -20 cm; (3) reed canary grass with groundwater at -10 cm; and (4) a fully rewetted peatland. The predictions were based on previous model calibrations with several high-resolution datasets consisting of water, heat, carbon, and nitrogen cycling. Spruce growth was calibrated by tree-ring data that extended the time period covered. The GHG balance of four scenarios, including vegetation and soil, were 4.7, 7.1, 9.1, and 6.2 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The total soil emissions (including litter and peat respiration CO2 + N2O + CH4) were 33.1, 19.3, 15.3, and 11.0 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, of which the peat loss contributed 35%, 24%, and 7% of the soil emissions for the three drained scenarios, respectively. No peat was lost for the wet peatland. It was also found that draining increases vegetation growth, but not as drastically as peat respiration does. The cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is sensitive to time frame, discount rate, and carbon price. Our results indicate that the net benefit was greater with a somewhat higher soil water table and when the peatland was vegetated with willow and reed canary grass (Scenarios 2 and 3). We conclude that saving peat and avoiding methane release using fairly wet conditions can significantly reduce GHG emissions, and that this strategy should be considered for land use planning and policy-making.

AB Wetland ecosystems are an important component in global carbon (C) cycles and may exert a large influence on global climate change. Predictions of C dynamics require us to consider interactions among many critical factors of soil, hydrology, and vegetation. However, few such integrated C models exist for wetland ecosystems. In this paper, we report a simulation model, Wetland-DNDC, for C dynamics and methane (CH4) emissions in wetland ecosystems. The general structure of Wetland-DNDC was adopted from PnET-N-DNDC, a process-oriented biogeochemical model that simulates C and N dynamics in upland forest ecosystems. Several new functions and algorithms were developed for Wetland-DNDC to capture the unique features of wetland ecosystems, such as water table dynamics, growth of mosses and herbaceous plants, and soil biogeochemical processes under anaerobic conditions. The model has been validated against various observations from three wetland sites in Northern America. The validation results are in agreement with the measurements of water table dynamics, soil temperature, CH4 fluxes, net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and annual C budgets. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the most critical input factors for C dynamics in the wetland ecosystems are air temperature, water outflow parameters, initial soil C content, and plant photosynthesis capacity. NEP and CH4 emissions are sensitive to most of the tested input variables. By integrating the primary drivers of climate, hydrology, soil and vegetation, the Wetland-DNDC model is capable of predicting C biogeochemical cycles in wetland ecosystems.

AB Using DNA barcoding and stable isotope analysis, we identified adult dragonfly prey items from the fecal pellets of five dragonfly species-Nannophya pygmaea, Ischnura asiatica, Sympetrum eroticum, Orthetrum albistylum, and Anax parthenope-collected from a mountain bog located in south-eastern South Korea. Twelve operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to four orders, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Lepidoptera, were identified as prey items of adult dragonflies using DNA barcoding. Among prey items, Dipterans were the most common, comprising seven of the 10 OTUs. Based on stable isotope analysis, adult dragonflies and their nymphs were among the most numerous predators in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Additionally, dragonfly species with smaller adult sizes had different isotopic compositions to those reaching larger adult sizes. Both delta N-15 and delta C-13 values were significantly lower in smaller species than in larger species, indicating differences in their trophic levels and carbon sources.

AB Drained peatlands aremajor sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, yet the effects of land management and hydrological extremes have been little-studied at spatial scales relevant to agricultural enterprises. We measured fluxes of CO2 using the eddy covariance (EC) technique at two adjacent dairy farms on a drained peatland in Aotearoa New Zealand with remaining peat depths 5.5-8 m. One site (SD) had shallow surface drains and mean water table depth (WTD) -657 mm, while the other site (BD) had deep field border drains and mean WTD -838 mm. Net ecosystem CO2 production (NEP) was similar at the two sites when the soils were moist but diverged during late-summer drying, with site BD having 4.56 t C ha(-1) greater CO2 emission than site SD over the four-month dry period. Soil drying reduced gross primary production (GPP) at both sites, while ecosystem respiration (ER) was reduced at site SD but not at site BD. The low dry season respiration rates at site SD contributed to near-zero annual NEP, while higher respiration rates at site BD led to annual CO2 loss of -4.95 +/- 0.59 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). Accounting for other imports and exports of carbon, annual net ecosystem carbon balances were -2.23 and -8.47 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) at sites SD and BD, respectively. It is likely that the contrasting dry season respiration rates resulted from differences in soil physical properties affecting soil moisture vertical redistribution and availability to plants and microbes rather than from the relatively small differences in WTD. These differences could be caused by soil physical disturbances during pasture renewal or paddock recontouring, or time since initial drainage. Therefore, improved soil management might provide practical mitigation against excessive CO2 emissions during dry conditions, including droughts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The globally widespread drainage of peatlands has often been shown to lead to increased concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streams and rivers. Elevated DOC concentrations have implications for carbon cycling, ecosystem functioning, and potable water treatment. Peatland rewetting, principally through ditch blocking, is often carried out with the expectation that this will reduce DOC concentrations. Uncertainty still remains as to whether drainage, or its reversal via ditch blocking, will also lead to changes in the molecular composition of DOC/dissolved organic matter (DOM), which have the potential to affect downstream processing and treatability of U.K. drinking water supplies. To investigate this question, we used a replicated experiment consisting of 12 parallel ditches on an upland bog and took samples of ditch water, pore water, and overland flow water for 4 years. After a brief preblocking baseline period, eight ditches were blocked using two methods. A complementary suite of optical metrics, chemical measurements, and analytical techniques revealed that ditch blocking had no consistent effect on DOM quality, up to 4 years after blocking. Where significant differences were found, effect size calculations demonstrated that these differences were small and would therefore have minimal impact upon water treatability. Furthermore, some differences between ditches were evident before blocking took place, highlighting the need for robust baseline monitoring before intervention. Based on our results from a hillslope-scale experiment, we were unable to identify clear evidence that peatland ditch blocking will deliver benefits in terms of DOM treatability in potable water supplies, although we also did not find any evidence of short-term deterioration in water quality during the restoration period. We conclude that, although peatland restoration can be expected to deliver other benefits such as reduced carbon loss and enhanced biodiversity, it is doubtful whether it will lead to improvements in drinking water treatability.

AB Strain 76, which was able to utilize dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) as a sole sulfur source, was screened from our microbial collection. It was identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens by taxonomical characterization and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. It does not belong to the methylotrophs, because it did not grow on DMDS or other C1 compounds as sole carbon source, and DMDS degradation was not repressed in the presence of glucose, Na2SO4, or nutrient broth. Moreover, it showed high resistance to DMDS by growing in DMDS at concentrations up to 9.04 mm. Based on these findings, strain 76 metabolizes DMDS and has dual physiological roles: sulfur assimilation and degradation. Thus it has advantages as a biological scavenger of DMDS.

AB Peatlands contain approximately one third of all soil organic carbon (SOC). Warming can alter above- and belowground linkages that regulate soil organic carbon dynamics and C-balance in peatlands. Here we examine the multiyear impact of in situ experimental warming on the microbial food web, vegetation, and their feedbacks with soil chemistry. We provide evidence of both positive and negative impacts of warming on specific microbial functional groups, leading to destabilization of the microbial food web. We observed a strong reduction (70%) in the biomass of top-predators (testate amoebae) in warmed plots. Such a loss caused a shortening of microbial food chains, which in turn stimulated microbial activity, leading to slight increases in levels of nutrients and labile C in water. We further show that warming altered the regulatory role of Sphagnum-polyphenols on microbial community structure with a potential inhibition of top predators. In addition, warming caused a decrease in Sphagnum cover and an increase in vascular plant cover. Using structural equation modelling, we show that changes in the microbial food web affected the relationships between plants, soil water chemistry, and microbial communities. These results suggest that warming will destabilize C and nutrient recycling of peatlands via changes in above- and belowground linkages, and therefore, the microbial food web associated with mosses will feedback positively to global warming by destabilizing the carbon cycle. This study confirms that microbial food webs thus constitute a key element in the functioning of peatland ecosystems. Their study can help understand how mosses, as ecosystem engineers, tightly regulate biogeochemical cycling and climate feedback in peatlands

AB The carbon sink function of peatlands is primarily driven by a higher production than decomposition of the litter Sphagnum mosses. The observed increase of vascular plants in peatlands could alter the decomposition rate and the carbon (C) cycle through a litter mixing effect, which is still poorly studied. Here, we examine the litter mixing effect of a peat moss (Sphagnum fallax) and two vascular plants (Pinus uncinata and Eriophorum vaginatum) in the field and laboratory-based experiment.
   During the laboratory incubation, mass loss, CO2 production, and dissolved organic carbon concentration were periodically monitored during 51 days. The collected data were then processed in a C dynamics model. The calculated enzymatic activity was correlated to the measured beta-glucosidase activity in the litter. In the field experiment, mass loss and CO2 production from litter bags were annually measured for 3 years.
   Both laboratory and field experiments clearly show that the litter mixture, i.e., Sphagnum-Pinus-Eriophorum, had a synergistic effect on decomposition by enhancing the mass loss. Such enhanced mass loss increased the water extractable C and CO2 production in the litter mixture during the laboratory experiment. The synergistic effect was mainly controlled by the Sphagnum-Eriophorum mixture that significantly enhanced both mass loss and CO2 production. Although the beta-glucosidase activity is often considered as a major driver of decomposition, mixing the litters did not cause any increase of the activity of this exo-enzyme in the laboratory experiment suggesting that other enzymes can play an important role in the observed effect.
   Mixing litters of graminoid and Sphagnum species led to a synergistic effect on litter decomposition. In a context of vegetation dynamics in response to environmental change, such a mixing effect could alter the C dynamics at a larger scale. Identifying the key mechanisms responsible for the synergistic effect on litter decomposition, with a specific focus on the enzymatic activities, is crucial to better predict the capacity of peatlands to act as C sinks.

AB The first continuous multi-year measurements of the CO2 exchange between a subarctic fen and the atmosphere were conducted at Kaamanen in northern Finland (69degreesN). According to our six-year data-set, the fen is presently a sink of atmospheric CO2 with a mean rate of -22 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The interannual variation of the CO2 balances originates almost completely from the variations during the snow-free period, but the efflux in the wintertime constitutes a significant part of the annual balance. The snow melt timing is the most important single determinant of the annual carbon balance. In contrast to a commonly-held view, the hydrometeorological conditions during the growing season had only a minor effect on the annual balance, emphasizing the importance of year-round measurements. This study indicates that climate warming may increase the length of the growing season and thus benefit rather than threaten the carbon pool of subarctic peatlands.

AB Peatlands act as a sink of carbon (C) through the accumulation of dead remains of plants. Under global changes triggered by human activities, it is not only the sink capacity of peatland that is in danger, but also the C already stored. Invasion of Sphagnum peatlands, mainly by Molinia caerulea and Betula spp, is a growing preoccupation. This study aims to assess the extent of the influence of this invasion on the biochemical characteristics of the peat. Elemental analysis, sugar and Rock-Eval pyrolysis parameters were measured in 50 cm profiles collected in invaded and intact plots. The results show that oxygen index ratios (OICO2/OICO) can be used to detect new C substrate injection as invading plants have a lower ratio than Sphagnum spp and Sphagnum peat. Total hemicellulosic sugar contents and organic matter (OM) degradation indices (R400, PPI) suggest that the invading plants promote a faster OM decomposition probably through a faster degradability and a relatively higher nutrient content of their litter. Differences in terms of nutrient status between areas of the peatland are suggested to be of great importance in determining the extent of OM transformation likely due to stoichiometric constraints.

DT Article

AB Peatland carbon may enter long-term storage in sedimentary basins preserved as either coal or lignite. The time required to account for the carbon in 1-10 m thick coal seams must represent 10(5)-10(6) years, an order of magnitude more than previously assumed. To understand the process by which this happens requires extrapolation of our understanding of peatland carbon accumulation over timescales that greatly exceed those of Holocene peat. We analyze the consequences of extrapolating peat growth to periods of 10(6) years. We deduce that that key to sustained peat growth are hydrologic landscapes that can maintain a saturated peat body above the level of clastic deposition. Contrary to current stratigraphic frameworks, we conclude that the generation of accommodation space at low rates of 0.1-0.2 mm/yr can adequately accommodate thick peat accumulation over periods >10(5) years. However, generation of accommodation space at rates >0.5 mm/yr cannot. The low rates that permit accommodation of thick peat are typical of the rates of subsidence in specific tectonic settings, particularly foreland basins, and this has implications for our understanding of the links between terrestrial carbon burial, tectonics and the carbon cycle. The long-term stability of extensive peatland required to form coal also requires sediment bypass, modifying basin wide sediment transport and deposition. Limits to peatland growth under very low accommodation rates must exist but the relative importance of the limiting process is not understood.

AB The accuracy of Arctic lake chronologies has been assessed by measuring the C-14 activities of modern carbon sources and applying these isotopic mass balances to dating fossil lake materials. Small (<1 km(2)) shallow (<25 m) Arctic lakes with watersheds <12 km(2) have soil and peat stratigraphic sections with C-14 activities ranging from 98 to 51% Modern. The C-14 activity of particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved inorganic carbon from lake and stream waters ranges from 121 to 95% Modern, The sediment-water interface of the studied lakes shows consistent C-14 ages of similar to 1000 C-14 yr, although the C-14 activity of living aquatic vegetation is 115% Modern. Radiocarbon measurements of components of the lacustrine carbon pool imply that the similar to 1000 C-14 yr age of the sediment-water interface results from deposition of C-14-depleted organic matter derived from the water-shed.

AB Previous studies have offered strong evidence that grazers alter the vegetation composition and ecosystem carbon (C) balance in ecosystems. In Arctic peatlands, however, the role of grazing has remained largely uninvestigated. Falk et al (2015 Environ. Res. Lett. 10 045001) showed that grazing by muskoxen in a high Arctic mire significantly affected both the vegetation and release of greenhouse gases. This finding highlights the potential of grazers to alter ecosystem processes in Arctic peatlands and, thus, to act as a major player in the global C budget.

AB Individuals of Sphagnum capillifolium were cultured for 2 mo under six different combinations of nighttime temperature and nutrients. Low nighttime temperature caused a five-fold reduction of growth. Growth was also reduced when the plants were cultured without any addition of nutrient in the growing medium, but only when nutrient deficiency was coupled with high nighttime temperature. Growth reduction was associated with decreased rates of net photosynthesis, but was not accompanied by a degradation of photosynthetic pigments and/or variations in the pigment ratios, nor was the ultrastructure of chloroplasts significantly altered. The decline in the net photosynthetic rate may be due to a limitation in the enzymatic reactions at unfavorable temperatures. Nitrogen and, especially, phosphorus appeared to limit growth of Sphagnum capillifolium at optimal temperatures. A nighttime temperature of 5 degrees C was above the lower threshold triggering the synthesis of red wall-pigments, Known to be promoted by nighttime chilling. Climate warming is expected to increase the growth rates of Sphagnum, but the consequences on the carbon balance of peatlands cannot be predicted because temperature rise may also enhance breakdown of peat.

AB Testate amoebae contribute significantly to belowground ecological processes like nutrient cycling, but a decline in their nutrient cycling functions in peatlands is expected due to global climate warming. We studied the dynamics of testate amoebae communities in relation to soil environmental variables in a permafrost peatland that experienced in situ experimental warming for a 7-yr period. Experimental warming reduced testate amoebae biomass by 41%. Redundancy analyses showed that testate amoebae community structure was correlated with water table depth and soil temperature (these explained 10% of the variance in community structure) and dissolved organic carbon (which explained 2.2% of the variance). Our results demonstrated that warming-induced changes to the water table depth affected the testate amoebae community in peatland, which could have consequences for the stability of the microbial food web and carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems.

AB 1 A general model of peatland dynamics is presented that emphasizes the interaction between water table depth and peat production. The model consists of two coupled, non-linear differential equations representing change in depth of peat and depth to the water table. Several simplified models are also considered to show the logical development of this model from previously published ones. The model provides an integrated view of how peatlands function over long time scales, by focusing on the non-linear interactions among peat production, decomposition and hydrology.
   2 Analysis of the model shows that equilibrium peat accumulation and water table depth depend on the net water input to the peatland. In drier sites, peatlands with relatively deep water tables develop and the equilibrium peat depth increases with increasing water input. In very wet conditions, peatlands have water tables near the surface, peat accumulation is limited by low production rates, and equilibrium peat depth is lower than is possible in comparatively drier sites. Over a range of intermediate water balances, there are two simultaneous equilibrium states where deep, dry peatlands and shallower, wet peatlands can both occur. This sensitivity to water balance suggests that small changes in precipitation regime, such as are expected with climate variability and change, could rapidly convert peatlands that are now in equilibrium into either sources or sinks of carbon.

AB Northern peatlands in their natural state are sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2) but sources of methane (CH4). They are often nitrogen limited and can act as sinks for greenhouse gas (GHG) nitrous oxide (N2O). Peatlands have been used to treat wastewaters from different point sources. Continuous nutrient and pollutant load to a nutrient limited peatland ecosystem may change the microbial processes and lead to increased productivity, which together are likely to change the GHG emissions. We studied the effect of wastewater derived from metal mining on N2O and CH4 emissions on two treatment peatlands in northern boreal zone. The measured CH4 fluxes from the reference point without any wastewater load were in the range of those reported from northern pristine peatlands while emissions from treatment peatlands were greatly reduced, presumably as result of high sulfate concentration in the porewater. N2O emissions were small in the reference point, but up to 300 times higher in the treatment peatlands. Methane emissions increased with increasing total organic carbon concentration and decreased with increasing sulfate concentration in the surface water, respectively, while N2O emissions increased with increasing nitrate concentrations. The data indicate drastic changes in GHG fluxes and related biogeochemical processes in treatment peatlands as compared to the reference point.

AB Boreal peatlands are an important carbon (C) sink. The effect of drainage for forestry on the soil C balance in those peatlands is a controversial debate. The Lakkasuo peatland, central Finland, comprise a minerotrophic and an ombrotrophic part, both partially drained for forestry. A pair-wise comparison was conducted and four different profile-based methods were applied to calculate the soil C balance. The first two methods used differences in ash content (I) between the upper and lower part of the profile and (II) between the drained and natural site of the peatland, respectively. The third method (III) used radiocarbon dated samples to calculate C accumulation rates at the natural site and compared these to the current C-stocks at the drained sites. The fourth method (IV) used radiocarbon dated samples to define a 1000-year layer in the profiles for comparing the C-stocks above this layer. Stable carbon isotope depth profiles, used for a qualitative assessment of the peatland status, identify both undrained site as undisturbed. All four methods indicate a C loss at the minerotrophic drained site but of different magnitude (0.057-0.272 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). At the ombrotrophic drained site both radiocarbon methods (III and IV) indicate a C gain (0.139-0.179 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) whereas methods I and II suggest a C loss (0.084-0.270 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Method IV is considered the most stringent and robust one. Yet, the comparison of profile-based methods for C balance assessment suggests them to be applicable depending on site specific conditions of nutrient status and presence of a natural reference site.

AB 1. Cut-away peatlands devoid of vegetation form a persistent source of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. The restoration of the C sink function in such areas can be facilitated by raising the water table. Planting vascular plants and Sphagnum may hasten the restoration process further. However, little is known about the effects of different species on the restoration process.
   2. We studied carbon dioxide (CO(2)) exchange in stands of different plants in a restored cut-away site over two growing seasons to quantify their ability to form a C sink. We sampled five different types of stand: monocultures of Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex rostrata (pure plots), mixtures of Eriophorum or Carex and Sphagnum mosses (mixed plots) and control plots without vegetation. We applied the closed chamber technique to gather CO(2) exchange data for modelling of gross photosynthesis (P(G)) and ecosystem respiration (R(E)). Finally, we used the models to reconstruct the seasonal net CO(2) exchange of the stands formed by different plants.
   3. While the control plots without vegetation were sources of 20-71 g CO(2)-C m(-2), all the vegetated plots acted as C sinks during both growing seasons. The monostands of E. vaginatum and C. rostrata created sinks of 23-114 g CO(2)-C m(-2), while the mixtures of sedge and Sphagnum mosses resulted in larger sinks of 75-186 g CO(2)-C m(-2). The larger sinks of the mixed patches were due to the lower respiration/photosynthesis ratio.
   4. To eliminate the effect of differences in water table and the abundance of sedges between the patches, we reconstructed the CO(2) exchange for constant water table and vascular leaf area for all plots. The simulation further supported our result: the mixtures of sedge and Sphagnum mosses were clearly more efficient in sequestering CO(2) than pure sedge stands.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The increased functional diversity in a cut-away peatland site resulted in higher net ecosystem exchange. When restoring cut-away peatlands, reintroduction of Sphagna is recommended after the colonization of vascular plants to hasten the formation of a sink for C.

AB Mire vegetation phenology is closely linked to the ecosystem carbon cycle but rarely monitored and quantified with high temporal resolution. In this study, we use digital repeat photography to explore phenology as a control of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange measured by eddy covariance (EC) in a minerogenic boreal mire in northern Sweden over 2 years (2011-2012). Strong correlations and seasonal hysteresis effects were observed between the green chromatic coordinate (g (cc)) derived from the digital image archive and leaf area index, day length, and growing degree-day sum (GDDS). Differences in GDDS between the 2 years were the main control on the between-year variations in the spring patterns of g (cc). Periods with lower water table level coincided with an increase of the red chromatic coordinate. The onset and magnitudes of EC-derived photosynthetic CO2 uptake (that is, gross ecosystem production, GEP) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) during the spring green-up of vascular plants were more closely related to those of g (cc) than to those of air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation. In contrast, abiotic variables controlled GEP during the summer period when vascular plant canopy cover was fully developed. Stepwise regression analysis suggested that g (cc) contributed substantially in explaining variations in GEP during spring and autumn. Over both growing seasons, g (cc) was well correlated with GEP (r (2) = 0.68), NEE (r (2) = 0.58), and ecosystem respiration (r (2) = 0.50). Overall, we show that digital repeat photography provides an inexpensive and effective method for the continuous quantification of the phenological patterns of the vascular plant community in mire ecosystems. Our results suggest that vegetation phenology is an important control of the mire CO2 exchange and should be considered in both experimental and modeling studies to better account for the separate effects of phenology and abiotic drivers on mire carbon dynamics.

AB Despite being a significant input into soil carbon pools of many high-latitude ecosystems, little is known about the effects of climate change on the turnover of mycorrhizal fungal necromass. Here, we present results from the first experiment examining the effects of climate change on the long-term decomposition of mycorrhizal necromass, utilising the Spruce and Peatland Response Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. Warming significantly increased necromass decomposition rates but was strongest in normally submerged microsites where warming caused water table drawdown. Necromass chemistry exerted the strongest control on the decomposition, with initial nitrogen content strongly predicting early decay rates (3 months) and initial melanin content determining mass remaining after 2 years. Collectively, our results suggest that as global temperatures rise, variation in species biochemical traits as well as microsites where mycorrhizal necromass is deposited will determine how these important inputs contribute to the belowground storage of carbon in boreal peatlands.

AB Plant biomass and its allocation patterns are instrumental in understanding global carbon sinks; however, knowledge is still limited, especially in high-altitude peatlands. We investigated aboveground and belowground biomass allocation in the Zoige peatland of the Tibetan plateau, China, and its relationship with environmental factors using data collected from 32 sites across the peatland during 2011 and 2012. Standardized major axis, multiple factor analysis and linear regression functions were used to perform data analysis. The average aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, total biomass and root: shoot ratio for the Zoige alpine peatland were 341.01, 3262.93, 3620.36 g m(-2) and 10.32, respectively. On average, approximately 86% of the root biomass was located in the top 30 cm of soil. There was positive allometric relationship (p < 0.01) between belowground biomass and aboveground biomass. The water conditions, soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen were the main factors that influenced plant biomass and biomass allocation in the Zoige peatland.

AB Microbial communities play crucial roles in the global carbon cycle, particularly in peatland ecosystems under climate change. The peatlands of the Sanjiang Plain could be highly vulnerable to global warming because they are mainly located at the southern limit of northern peatlands. In this study, the alpha diversity and composition of bacterial communities in three different minerotrophic fens along a chronosequence were investigated. We captured a rich microbial community that included many rare operational taxonomic units (OTUs) but was dominated by a few bacterial classes that have frequently been detected in other peatland ecosystems. Notably, a large diversity of methanotrophs affiliated with Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria was also detected. Bacterial alpha diversity and composition varied as a function of peat depth and its associated physical-chemical properties, such as total carbon, total nitrogen, pH and bulk density. We also found that bacterial community turnover (beta diversity) to be significantly correlated with soil age, whereas bacterial alpha diversity was not.

AB [1] Subglacial environments are a previously neglected component of the Earth's global carbon cycle, a reflection of the view held until recently that they are dominated by abiotic and oxic conditions. Here we provide a realistic assessment of the theory that the basal regions of the ice sheets that formed over North America and Europe during glaciations were host to significant populations of anaerobic microorganisms, including methanogens, able to metabolize organic carbon sequestered during interglacials and overridden during Quaternary glacials. In doing so, we review the current evidence for subglacial methane release during deglaciation, estimate the size of the subglacial reservoir of organic carbon (SOC), and assess the amount of SOC available to subglacial microbes and the likely pathways and rates of carbon turnover. We then discuss the fate of subglacial methane and the potential impact of its release on atmospheric methane concentrations. We calculate that the SOC equates to 418-610 Pg C and includes carbon from terrestrial soils/vegetation, peatlands, lake, and marine sediments. The SOC that is potentially available for microbial conversion to methane is smaller than this estimate due to (1) glacial erosion, (2) accumulation of recalcitrant organic carbon compounds over time, (3) conversion to carbon dioxide by aerobic/anaerobic respiration, and (4) incomplete conversion of labile organic matter to methane. We estimate that the total SOC available for conversion to methane is 63 Pg C. Our estimates of methane production potentials span a wide range because of the current uncertainty surrounding subglacial metabolic rates. We believe, however, that there is a strong likelihood that subglacial microbes could convert 63 Pg of SOC to methane during a glacial cycle. If this were the case, release of this methane from the ice sheet margins during retreat would need to be episodic in order to significantly impact atmospheric methane concentrations. Our findings suggest that it may well be important to consider subglacial environments as active components of the Earth's carbon cycle. Conclusive determination of the potential impact of subglacial methane production on atmospheric methane concentrations during deglaciation, however, awaits more precise determination of the ability of subglacial microbes to degrade organic carbon components and their associated rates of metabolism under in situ conditions.

AB This paper examines the implications of imposing a climate tax on food consumption in Sweden combined with refunding of the tax revenues to farmers for selected agricultural activities enhancing ecosystem services: restoration of drained peatland (carbon sequestration), maintenance of grassland (biodiversity), and construction of wetlands (nutrient regulation). A partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector is used to assess economic and environmental effects. The results show that the introduction of a climate tax corresponding to the existing Swedish CO2 tax of 115 euros per tonne carbon dioxide equivalent reduces total emissions from food consumption by 4.4% without any refunding of tax revenues. Refunding with payments for all ecosystems enhances the carbon sink by an amount equivalent to 57% of CO2e emissions from food consumption, and results in net benefits in the tax refund system for the agricultural sector as a whole, but is regressive where farmers in regions with relatively high incomes receive proportionally much of the net benefits.

AB Global climate changes sometimes spark biological radiations that can feed back to effect significant ecological impacts. Northern Hemisphere peatlands dominated by living and dead peatmosses (Sphagnum) harbor almost 30% of the global soil carbon pool and have functioned as a net carbon sink throughout the Holocene, and probably since the late Tertiary. Before that time, northern latitudes were dominated by tropical and temperate plant groups and ecosystems. Phylogenetic analyses of mosses (phylum Bryophyta) based on nucleotide sequences from the plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear genomes indicate that most species of Sphagnum are of recent origin (ca. <20 Ma). Sphagnum species are not only well-adapted to boreal peatlands, they create the conditions that promote development of peatlands. The recent radiation that gave rise to extant diversity of peatmosses is temporally associated with Miocene climatic cooling in the Northern Hemisphere. The evolution of Sphagnum has had profound influences on global biogeochemistry because of the unique biochemical, physiological, and morphological features of these plants, both while alive and after death.

AB Empty fruit bunch (EFB), an underutilized waste product of oil palm processing, was studied as a substrate for the production of humic acids (HA) by a Trichoderma reesei strain by solid-state fermentation (SSF) in Raimbault columns. HA have attracted the attention of many investigators due to their applications in agriculture, industry, the environment, and biomedicine. Commercial HA are currently chemically extracted from peat and coal, which are nonrenewable carbon sources. Biotechnological processes are important for their sustainable and controlled production, with SSF being especially promising for mimicking the natural habitat of fungi. Trichoderma sporulation and HA production are related, and the results of this study showed that SSF stimulated fast sporulation. The productivity related to HA was much higher than that of the biomass, indicating an efficient utilization of EFB. These findings, added to the low cost of EFB, make SSF an attractive process for HA production.

AB Effect of peat on cadmium content in soil morphology, cabbage growth and cadmium content and ecological characteristics of the microbial using Cd-contaminated vegetable plot is investigated. The results showed that the pH of soil can be significantly improved and effective Cd content in soil can be reduced after peat was added. Lasting effect remains significant although three crops of cabbage were continuously planted. The application of peat, continuous planting cabbage compared with the control can significantly increase the biomass and decrease the Cd content in shoots. Continuous planting of three crop of cabbage and the content of Cd increased, but were lower than the limited value in GB2762-2012. Peat can increase the activity of microorganisms in soil, peat and plant with more obvious effect on the increase in microbial activity in soil. The ability to increase can promote Chinese cabbage growth and inhibit the absorption of Cd by polymers, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids and other carbon sources.

AB Peatlands contain a large portion of Earth's terrestrial soil organic matter in part due to a reduction in decomposition rates. Organic matter decomposition is initially mediated by extracellular enzyme activity, which is in turn controlled by temperature, moisture, and substrate availability; and all are subject to seasonal variation. As depth increases in peatlands, temperature variability and labile carbon inputs decrease. We hypothesized that the more stable recalcitrant subsurface would contain a smaller less diverse enzyme pool, that is better adapted to a narrow temperature range. Thus temperature dependence would be diminished at depth compared to superficial peat. Potential enzyme activity rates were determined across seasons and with depth in peat samples collected from the Marcell Experimental Forest in northern Minnesota, USA. The temperature dependence, assessed by activation energy, was quantified for three hydrolytic enzymes involved in nutrient cycling at up to 15 temperature points ranging from 2 degrees C to 65 degrees C. Potential enzyme activity decreased with peat depth as expected and corresponded with changes in peat composition and microbial biomass from the acrotelm to the catotelm. In an environmentally relevant temperature range (2-23 degrees C), activation energy decreased with depth for beta-glucosidase as predicted and leucine amino peptidase activation energy was the lowest of all enzymes. Stable temperatures at depth appear to result in a microbial community containing enzymes that have lower sensitivity to temperature increases. Surprisingly, there was no significant seasonal effect on enzyme temperature dependence observed in our study. Based on these results, and without shifts in microbial community composition, warming of peat could result in increased carbon and phosphorus cycling at the surface but little change at depth. Additionally differences in enzyme temperature sensitivity suggest nitrogen cycling could remain constant with warming, potentially resulting in proteolytic nitrogen cycling being decoupled from carbon and phosphorus cycling.

ID WETLANDS; CLASSIFICATION; BACKSCATTER
AB As part of a wider study of carbon cycling in boreal peatlands, radar remote sensing was used with the objective of obtaining diverse environmental information related to these peatland areas. This paper presents a case study of three peatlands located in the La Grande River watershed, Quebec, Canada. An analysis of multitemporal fine- mode RADARSAT-1 images was carried out, with the support of collected field data, to verify if hydrological conditions influence radar backscatter coefficients. Changes in hydrological conditions are reflected in the radar backscatter coefficient for areas having low and sparse trees. A maximum likelihood classification (MLC) on speckle-filtered images and textures was also carried out, evaluated, and compared with a similar classification procedure on standard-mode images. MLC using textures generated from multitemporal fine- mode images gave poorer results than a similar classification using multitemporal standard-mode textural images (35% versus 59% of overall accuracy using 10 classes and 37% versus 74% of overall accuracy using four classes).

AB The inception of the Sphagnum (peat moss) genome project marks the first plant-based sequencing project aimed specifically at carbon cycling genomics in a plant system relevant to ecological and evolutionary genomics. Sphagnum provides considerable intra-and interspecific variation at the nucleotide level, and in physiology, morphology, net production, decomposition and carbon accumulation (peat formation). Because of the large number of peat moss species, their diversity in mating systems, and clear patterns of niche differentiation, Sphagnum provides an exceptionally valuable complement to Physcomitrella patens and Ceratodon purpureus as moss models for genomic research. Here we review the organismal biology of Sphagnum including phylogeny, life cycle, mating systems, ecology and niche differentiation. We include the current state of Sphagnum genomic resources, in vitro methods and germplasm. A use-case is provided to address questions concerning epigenetics and reproduction.

AB Ice-core records show that abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) climatic warming events of the last glacial period were accompanied by large increases in the atmospheric CH4 concentration (up to 200 ppbv). These abrupt changes are generally regarded as arising from the effects of changes in the Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation and the resultant climatic impact on natural CH4 sources, in particular wetlands. We use two different ecosystem models of wetland CH4 emissions to simulate northern CH4 sources forced with coupled general circulation model simulations of five different time periods during the last glacial to investigate the potential influence of abrupt ocean circulation changes on atmospheric CH4 levels during D-O events. The simulated warming over Greenland of 7-9 degrees C in the different time periods is at the lower end of the range of 11-15 degrees C derived from ice cores, but is associated with strong impacts on the hydrological cycle, especially over the North Atlantic and Europe during winter. We find that although the sensitivity of CH4 emissions to the imposed climate varies significantly between the two ecosystem emissions models, the model simulations do not reproduce sufficient emission changes to satisfy ice-core observations of CH4 increases during abrupt events. The inclusion of permafrost physics and peatland carbon cycling in one model (LPJ-WHyMe) increases the climatic sensitivity of CH4 emissions relative to the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM) model, which does not incorporate these processes. For equilibrium conditions this additional sensitivity is mostly due to differences in carbon cycle processes, whilst the increased sensitivity to the imposed abrupt warmings is also partly due to the effects of freezing on soil thermodynamics. These results suggest that alternative scenarios of climatic change could be required to explain the abrupt glacial CH4 variations, perhaps with a more dominant role for tropical wetland CH4 sources.

AB Permafrost thawing in peatlands has the potential to alter the catchment export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), thus influencing the carbon balance and cycling in linked aquatic and ocean ecosystems. Peatlands along the southern margins of the Eurasian permafrost are relatively underexplored despite the considerable risks associated with permafrost degradation due to climate warming. This study examined dynamics of DOC export from a permafrost peatland catchment located in northeastern China during the 2012 to 2014 growing seasons. The estimated annual DOC loads varied greatly between 3211 and 19 022 kg yr(-1), with a mean DOC yield of 4.7 gm(-2) yr(-1). Although the estimated DOC yield was in the lower range compared with other permafrost regions, it was still significant for the net carbon balance in the studied catchment. There were strong linkages between daily discharge and DOC concentrations in both wet and dry years, suggesting a transport-limited process of DOC delivery from the catchment. Discharge explained the majority of both seasonal and interannual variations of DOC concentrations, which made annual discharge a good indicator of total DOC load from the catchment. As indicated by three fluorescence indices, DOC source and chemical characteristics tracked the shift of flow paths during runoff processes closely. Interactions between the flow path and DOC chemical characteristics were greatly influenced by the seasonal thawing of the soil active layer. The deepening of the active layer due to climate warming likely increases the proportion of microbial-originated DOC in baseflow discharge.

AB The peat bog at Ocsa is located at the northern part of the Danube-Tisa Interfluves at the transitional zone of two landscapes with different morphological characters. At the boundary of the Danube-Tisa Interfluves and the Danube-along Plain a marshland sequence can be found from Hajos to Ocsa. We extended our research to the Ocsa peat bog to complete the environmental historical investigations in the examined area, as well.
   The bog is located in a former pool formed by the Danube River in which aeolian sand and thick lake sediment deposited from the Late Pleistocene. The initial oligotrophic lake became mesotrophic, therefore thick carbonate sediment deposited. Afterwards, as a consequence of the Neolithic human occupations, the natural development of the lake changed drastically and the lake choked up. The pollen and quartermalacological analysis of the area support the mentioned geological processes.

AB Peatlands are an important potential sink or source of carbon and play a significant role in climate change regulation. Understanding peatland as 3D-landforms is as important as mapping their spatial extent. The main aim of this work was to estimate a 3D representation of peat properties and assess the associated spatial uncertainty, to provide baseline information for climate and land use change analyses. In this study a combination of 3D Generalized Additive Models and 3D geostatistics was applied to a raised basin bog using legacy data to map carbon content. The study presents a novel approach based on methods providing quantification of the spatial uncertainty and the possibility to model complex relationships. The approach fully exploits the 3D spatial relationships between the survey points while supported by environmental variables. The methods proved to be general and highly flexible.
   The results of this study showed that it is possible to model peat properties to obtain a detailed volumetric assessment of the peat, including carbon stocks from a limited set of legacy data. The estimates of spatial uncertainty are important when including the results in further environmental and climate-change models or for decision making to provide alternatives and prioritisation.

AB Globally, peatlands are under threat from a range of land use related factors that have a significant impact on the provision of ecosystem services, such as biodiversity and carbon (C) sequestration/storage. In Ireland, approximately 84% of raised bogs (a priority habitat listed in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive) have been affected by peat extraction. While restoration implies the return of ecosystem services that were characteristic of the pre-disturbed ecosystem, achieving this goal is often a challenge in degraded peatlands as post-drainage conditions vary considerably between sites. Here, we present multi-year greenhouse gas (GHG) and vegetation dynamics data from two former raised bogs in Ireland that were drained and either industrially extracted (milled) or cut on the margins for domestic use and subsequently rewetted (with no further management). When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the rewetted nutrient poor domestic cutover peatland was a net sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) (-49 +/- 66 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and a source of methane (CH4) (19.7 +/- 5 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), while the nutrient rich industrial cutaway was a net source of CO2 (0.66 +/- 168 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) and CH4 (5.0 +/- 2.2 g Cm-2 yr(-1)). The rewetted domestic cutover site exhibited the expected range of micro-habitats and species composition found in natural (non-degraded) counterparts. In contrast, despite successful rewetting, the industrially extracted peatland did not exhibit typical raised bog flora. This study demonstrated that environmental and management variables can influence species composition and, therefore, the regeneration of species typical of natural sites, and has highlighted the climate benefits from rewetting degraded peatlands in terms of reduced GHG emissions. However, rewetting of degraded peatlands is a major challenge and in some cases reintroduction of bryophytes typical of natural raised bogs may be more difficult than the achievement of proper GHG emission savings.

AB Anthropogenic greenhouse gases are expected to induce changes in global climate that can alter ecosystems in ways that, in turn, may further affect climate. Such climate-ecosystem interactions can generate either positive or negative feedbacks to the climate system, thereby either enhancing or diminishing the magnitude of global climate change. Important terrestrial feedback mechanisms include CO2 fertilization (negative feedbacks), carbon storage in vegetation and soils (positive and negative feedbacks), vegetation albedo (positive feedbacks), and peatland methane emissions (positive and negative feedbacks). While the processes involved are complex, not readily quantifiable, and demonstrate both positive and negative feedback potential, we conclude that the combined effect of the feedback mechanisms reviewed here will likely amplify climate change relative to current projections that have not yet adequately incorporated these mechanisms.

AB Forests in northern Fennoscandia are mainly composed of the O-3-sensitive species-Scots pine and downy, mountain, and silver birches. Seminatural vegetation also contributes to biodiversity, carbon cycling, and ecosystem services as a part of forests, mires, meadows, and road verges. Fumigation experiments show that current O-3 concentrations of 30-50 ppb reduce plant biomass production and reproduction. Visible foliar injury is attributable to peak O-3 concentrations and relates to fast phenological development and high growth rate. Trees can acclimate to O-3-induced water stress by producing more xeromorphic leaves or needles. The direct effects of O-3 on grassland vegetation also translate to changes in the structure and size of the soil microbial community, and ecosystem N cycling. It is necessary to reduce the emission of O-3 precursors and maintain high biodiversity to protect northern ecosystems. Regular, systematic, countrywide monitoring and validation as well as quantification of the effects of O-3 on plants in the Nordic countries are also necessary.

AB In this study, systematic soil methane cycle geochemical monitoring was carried out in a typical gas hydrate region in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Soil gas samples were collected for hydrocarbon components and carbon isotope analysis. Meanwhile, soil-methane fluxes from the upper active layer (20-30cm) were monitored during six months of one year. The results of this research provide evidence of a new source of methane emission from wetland soils in permafrost regions: gas hydrate release. Sites with large methane emissions were found using flux monitoring, the characteristics of thermogenic methane were identified using carbon isotope tracing, and the relationship between emission by soils and effusion from gas hydrates was determined through correlation analyses of soil-adsorbed hydrocarbons. Seasonal variation of methane emissions are also discussed by considering the emission of bacterial methane, thermogenic methane, and the absorption of methane from the soil active layer. These comprehensive findings provide valuable information for carbon cycle research of wetlands in permafrost regions.

AB Results of long-term estimates of carbon stock and current carbon sequestration in pine-shrub-sphagnum BGC in Vasyugan Mire (VM) are discussed. In different climatic conditions (different years), ND P varies from 206 to 337 g Cm-2 year(-1). An increase in carbon-emission intensity was detected in drier vegetation periods. Most of the carbon losses are the emission of carbon dioxide (average is 61.3 g Cm-2 years(-1), or 23.5% NPP). It is possible to ascertain the progression of peat formation. The removal of the carbon by bog waters was calculated using a mathematical model. It was estimated as 3.0% ND D with a mean value of the removal of 7.9 g Cm-2 years(-1). Based on the model of bogs vertical growth, the modern rate of carbon accumulation was estimated in the range from 10.3 g Cm-2 years(-1) in polygonal bogs to 51.7 g Cm-2 years(-1) in grassy bogs.

AB Overviewing the European carbon (C), greenhouse gas (GHG), and non-GHG fluxes, gross primary productivity (GPP) is about 9.3 Pg yr-1, and fossil fuel imports are 1.6 Pg yr-1. GPP is about 1.25% of solar radiation, containing about 360 x 1018 J energy - five times the energy content of annual fossil fuel use. Net primary production (NPP) is 50%, terrestrial net biome productivity, NBP, 3%, and the net GHG balance, NGB, 0.3% of GPP. Human harvest uses 20% of NPP or 10% of GPP, or alternatively 1 parts per thousand of solar radiation after accounting for the inherent cost of agriculture and forestry, for production of pesticides and fertilizer, the return of organic fertilizer, and for the C equivalent cost of GHG emissions. C equivalents are defined on a global warming potential with a 100-year time horizon. The equivalent of about 2.4% of the mineral fertilizer input is emitted as N2O. Agricultural emissions to the atmosphere are about 40% of total methane, 60% of total NO-N, 70% of total N2O-N, and 95% of total NH3-N emissions of Europe. European soils are a net C sink (114 Tg yr-1), but considering the emissions of GHGs, soils are a source of about 26 Tg CO2 C-equivalent yr-1. Forest, grassland and sediment C sinks are offset by GHG emissions from croplands, peatlands and inland waters. Non-GHGs (NH3, NOx) interact significantly with the GHG and the C cycle through ammonium nitrate aerosols and dry deposition. Wet deposition of nitrogen (N) supports about 50% of forest timber growth. Land use change is regionally important. The absolute flux values total about 50 Tg C yr-1. Nevertheless, for the European trace-gas balance, land-use intensity is more important than land-use change. This study shows that emissions of GHGs and non-GHGs significantly distort the C cycle and eliminate apparent C sinks.

AB A portable infrared laser absorption spectrometer named SPIRIT (SPectrometre Infra-Rouge In situ Tropospherique) has been set up for the simultaneous flux measurements of trace gases at the geosphere-atmosphere interface. It uses a continuous wave distributed feedback room temperature quantum cascade laser and a patented new optical multi-pass cell. The aim of SPIRIT field studies is to get a better understanding of land and water bodies to atmosphere exchange mechanisms of greenhouse gases (GHG). The analytical procedures to derive concentrations and fluxes are described, as well as the performances of the instrument under field conditions. The ability of SPIRIT to assess space and time dependence emissions of two GHG-nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)-for different types of ecosystems is demonstrated through in situ measurements on peatland, on fertilized soil, and on water body systems. The objectives of these investigations and preliminary significant results are reported.

AB Northern peatlands are a diverse group of ecosystems varying along a continuum of hydrological, chemical, and vegetation gradients. These ecosystems contain about one third of the global soil carbon pool, but it is uncertain how carbon and water cycling processes and response to climate change differ among peatland types. This study examines midsummer CO2 and H2O fluxes measured using the eddy covariance technique above seven northern peatlands including a low-shrub bog, two open poor fens, two wooded moderately rich fens, and two open extreme-rich fens. Gross ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration correlated positively with vegetation indices and with each other. Consequently, 24-hour net ecosystem CO2 exchange was similar among most of the sites (an average net carbon sink of 1.5 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)) despite large differences in water table depth, water chemistry, and plant communities. Evapotranspiration was primarily radiatively driven at all sites but a decline in surface conductance with increasing water vapor deficit indicated physiological restrictions to transpiration, particularly at the peatlands with woody vegetation and less at the peatlands with 100% Sphagnum cover. Despite these differences, midday evapotranspiration ranged only from 0.21 to 0.34 mm h(-1) owing to compensation among the factors controlling evapotranspiration. Water use efficiency varied among sites primarily as a result of differences in productivity and plant functional type. Although peatland classification includes a great variety of ecosystem characteristics, peatland type may not be an effective way to predict the magnitude and characteristics of midsummer CO2 and water vapor exchanges.

AB The hydrological cycle has significant effects on the terrestrial carbon (C) balance through its controls on photosynthesis and C decomposition. A detailed representation of the water cycle in terrestrial C cycle models is essential for reliable estimates of C budgets. However, it is challenging to accurately describe the spatial and temporal variations of soil water, especially for regional and global applications. Vertical and horizontal movements of soil water should be included. To constrain the hydrology-related uncertainty in modelling the regional C balance, a three-dimensional hydrological module was incorporated into the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon-budget model (InTEC V3.0). We also added an explicit parameterization of wetlands. The inclusion of the hydrological module considerably improved the model's ability to Simulate C content and balances in different ecosystems. Compared with measurements at five flux-tower sites, the model captured 85% and 82% of the variations in volumetric soil moisture content in the 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm depths during the growing season and 84% of the interannual variability in the measured C balance. The simulations showed that lateral subsurface water redistribution is a necessary mechanism for simulating water table depth for both poorly drained forest and peatland sites. Nationally, soil C content and their spatial variability are significantly related to drainage class. Poorly drained areas are important C sinks at the regional scale, however, their soil C content and balances are difficult to model and may have been inadequately represented in previous C cycle models. The InTEC V3.0 model predicted an annual net C uptake by Canada's forests and wetlands for the period 1901-1998 of 111.9 Tg C yr(-1), which is 41.4 Tg C yr(-1) larger than our previous estimate (InTEC V2.0). The increase in the net C uptake occurred mainly in poorly drained regions and resulted from the inclusion of a separate wetland parameterization and a detailed hydrologic module with lateral flow in InTEC V3.0.

AB Here we present results from a field experiment in an Arctic wetland situated in Zackenberg, NE Greenland. During one growing season we investigated how dominance of the sedge Eriophorum scheuchzeri affected the below-ground concentrations of low molecular weight carbon compounds (LMWOC) and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in comparison to dominance of other sedges (Carex stans and Dupontia psilosantha). Three groups of LMWOC were analysed using liquid chromatography-ionspray tandem mass spectrometry, i.e., organic acids (OAs), amino acids (AAs) and simple carbohydrates (CHs). To identify the effect of plant composition the experiments were carried out in a continuous fen area with very little between species variation in environmental conditions, e.g., water-table and active layer thickness and soil temperature. The pool of labile LMWOC compounds in this Arctic fen was dominated by OAs, constituting between 75 and 83% of the total pore water pool of OAs. CHs and Ms. The dominant OA was acetic acid, an easily available substrate for methanogens, which constituted >= 85% of the OA pool. We estimated that the concentration of acetic acid found in pore water would support 2 -2.5 h of CH4 flux and an additional continuous input of acetic acid through root exudation that would support 1.3-1.5 h of CH4 flux. Thus, the results clearly points to the importance of a continuous input for acetoclastic methanogenesis to be sustainable. Additionally, Eriophorum had a very strong effect on parts of the carbon cycle in the Arctic fen. The mean seasonal CH4 flux was twice as high in Eriophorum dominated plots, most likely due to a 1.7 times higher concentration of OAs in these plots. Further, the ecosystem respiration was 1.3 times higher in Eriophorum dominated plots. In conclusion, the results offer further support to the importance of certain vascular plant species for the carbon cycle of wetland ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background, Aims and Scope. Soil microbial community diversity has been suggested as a way of assessing the 'health' or 'quality' of soils. While molecular (genetic) or biochemical (phenotypic) measurements of microbial diversity have their place, functional diversity is popular in that it relates to the activity of the soil microflora, particularly in the carbon cycle. Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPPs) are usually assessed by carbon substrate utilization. The aim here is to review the various methods available for CLPP assessment.
   Main Features. The original method for CLPP determination was based upon the Biolog plate with its range of 95 carbon substrates and many studies have been employing this over the past 15 years. However, a number of criticisms have been leveled at the method, principally that it relies upon the growth of an extracted microbial population, which may not represent the true functioning of the whole soil. A multiple carbon-source, substrate induced respiration method (multi-SIR) was developed that did measure the response of the whole soil community without the need for growth but it did not have the convenience of the microtitre plate format. MicroReSp (TM) was designed to overcome the deficiencies in both methods and we have applied it to a range of media including mineral and organic soils, sediments and litter. In addition we have adapted the method to the testing of a wide range of carbon substrates such as hydrocarbons, terpenes and pesticides.
   Results. The MicroReSp (TM) technique covers the middle road of relevance and convenience, being a 'whole soil' method in a flexible microtitre plate format. It also has the advantage that it can be adapted for the use of radiolabelled (C-14) substrates, which increases the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. A few direct comparisons between MicroReSp (TM) have been made. We have found that its discriminatory ability compares favourably with Biolog while other users have reported it to be superior to the multiple SIR approach. A number of laboratories around the world are now utilizing MicroReSp (TM) and reporting good sensitivity to changes to the microbial community due to such varied factors as age of forest rehabilitation, heavy metal treatment, hydrocarbon exposure, salinity, peatland vegetation, cropping system and tree clone type.
   Discussion. A comparison of the available methods reveals that each has its advantages and drawbacks. The choice of method may depend upon the particular hypotheses or questions.
   Conclusions. MicroReSp (TM) offers a convenient, rapid and sensitive method for the determination of Community Level Physiological Profiles. Its application in a number of case studies has demonstrated its utility and advantages over other methods though its full potential for characterizing soil activity is yet to be realized. Perspectives. Increasing awareness of the environmental pressures on soils and the need to monitor soil health has resulted in a range of potential indicators. Microbial functional diversity is one such indicator that seeks to characterize a core soil attribute. The availability of rapid methods for its assessment will aid our understanding of such pressures on basic soil functioning.

AB Much attention has been given to the carbon balance of peatland and heathland ecosystems and their role as global carbon stores. They are also important as buffers for atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution, locking N into the soil and vegetation through tight nutrient cycling and preventing the leaching of soluble N into freshwater ecosystems. We compared mean annual soil exchangeable N, mineralisation and soil solution nitrogen at three contrasting ericaceous-dominated ecosystems: a lowland heath, an upland heath and an ombrotrophic raised bog at intermediate altitude, all of which were sites of long-term N-manipulation experiments. We expected that soil leachate N would be associated with soil C/N and total soil C, and that sites with higher C % and soil C/N would have greater ability to buffer N deposition before N saturation and leaching began. However, although soil solution N responded to N deposition at all the sites, we found that only the heathland sites were consistent with this expectation. The bog, with the highest C/N and largest C pool, was not the most strongly buffered. The upland heath was most effective at retaining N (extractable NH4+-N +3900 % from control) compared to the lowland heath (extractable NH4+-N +370 % from control) and the bog (extractable NH4+-N, +140-240 % from control). We concluded that the absence of a definable Calluna litter layer at the lowland heath and the bog, and the anoxic conditions at the bog, explained the earlier onset of leaching and that carbon and nitrogen cycles appeared more closely coupled in the heathlands but became decoupled at the bog due to the strong controlling effect of hydrology.

AB In this follow-on study on aboveground biomass of shrubs and short-stature trees, we provide plant component aboveground biomass (herein 'AGB') as well as plant component AGB allometric models for five common boreal shrub and four common boreal short-stature tree genera/species. The analyzed plant components consist of stem, branch, and leaf organs. We found similar ratios of component biomass to total AGB for stems, branches, and leaves amongst shrubs and deciduous tree genera/species across the southern Northwest Territories, while the evergreen Picea genus differed in the biomass allocation to aboveground plant organs compared to the deciduous genera/species. Shrub component AGB allometric models were derived using the three-dimensional variable volume as predictor, determined as the sum of line-intercept cover, upper foliage width, and maximum height above ground. Tree component AGB was modeled using the cross-sectional area of the stem diameter as predictor variable, measured at 0.30 m along the stem length. For shrub component AGB, we achieved better model fits for stem biomass (60.33 g <= RMSE <= 163.59 g; 0.651 <= R-2 <= 0.885) compared to leaf biomass (12.62 g <= RMSE <= 35.04 g; 0.380 <= R-2 <= 0.735), as has been reported by others. For short-stature trees, leaf biomass predictions resulted in similar model fits (18.21 g <= RMSE <= 70.0 g; 0.702 <= R-2 <= 0.882) compared to branch biomass (6.88 g <= RMSE <= 45.08 g; 0.736 <= R-2 <= 0.923) and only slightly better model fits for stem biomass (30.87 g <= RMSE <= 11.72 g; 0.887 <= R-2 <= 0.960), which suggests that leaf AGB of short-stature trees (<4.5 m) can be more accurately predicted using cross-sectional area as opposed to diameter at breast height for tall-stature trees. Our multi-species shrub and short-stature tree allometric models showed promising results for predicting plant component AGB, which can be utilized for remote sensing applications where plant functional types cannot always be distinguished. This study provides critical information on plant AGB allocation as well as component AGB modeling, required for understanding boreal AGB and aboveground carbon pools within the dynamic and rapidly changing Taiga Plains and Taiga Shield ecozones. In addition, the structural information and component AGB equations are important for integrating shrubs and short-stature tree AGB into carbon accounting strategies in order to improve our understanding of the rapidly changing boreal ecosystem function.

AB Paddy methane (CH4) production is biologically dominated by methanogenic archaea that metabolize a variety of organic and/or inorganic carbon sources. Though formate is easily dissimilated into H-2/CO2, formate-metabolizing methanogenic archaea are distinct from CO2-utilizing methanogen taxa. The identity of formate metabolizing methanogenic archaea in paddy soil remains elusive. In this investigation, molecular approaches based on stable isotope probing (SIP) technique were conducted to identify the formate-metabolizing methanogenic archaea in paddy soil. CH4 emission monitor, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses consistently indicated that some methanogenic archaea metabolized C-13-labeled formate in microcosm and accounted for a large portion of formate-metabolizing archaea in anoxic paddy soil. Phylogenetic identification further found that this guild was affiliated to Methgnabacteriaceae. Taken together Methanobacteriaceae could be the dominant formate-metabolizing methanogenic archaea and play an important role in the CH4 production in paddy soil. These findings would extend the extant knowledge on paddy methanogenic archaea and microbial-driven paddy CH4 emission.

TI Divergent responses of permafrost peatlands to recent climate change
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE permafrost; peatlands; climate change; hydrology; carbon
AB Permafrost peatlands are found in high-latitude regions and store globally-important amounts of soil organic carbon. These regions are warming at over twice the global average rate, causing permafrost thaw, and exposing previously inert carbon to decomposition and emission to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. However, it is unclear how peatland hydrological behaviour, vegetation structure and carbon balance, and the linkages between them, will respond to permafrost thaw in a warming climate. Here we show that permafrost peatlands follow divergent ecohydrological trajectories in response to recent climate change within the same rapidly warming region (northern Sweden). Whether a site becomes wetter or drier depends on local factors and the autogenic response of individual peatlands. We find that bryophyte-dominated vegetation demonstrates resistance, and in some cases resilience, to climatic and hydrological shifts. Drying at four sites is clearly associated with reduced carbon sequestration, while no clear relationship at wetting sites is observed. We highlight the complex dynamics of permafrost peatlands and warn against an overly-simple approach when considering their ecohydrological trajectories and role as C sinks under a warming climate.

AB The influence of oil pollution caused by the accident of 1994 on the biological activity of Histic Cryosols is considered. Despite the use of complex mechanical (oil removal), physicochemical (washing on special devices), and agrotechnical (fertilization, plowing, grass sowing) reclamation techniques, the residual content of oil hydrocarbons in the soils can reach high values. The disturbance of the natural peat soil horizon during the reclamation procedures reduces the respiratory activity, as well as the potential rate of consuming the substrates, plant residues and water-soluble organic matter, which decreases the carbon cycle rate.

AB Carbon fluxes at two boreal peatland-dominated catchments in northeastern Alberta were investigated through the analysis of fen and lake water chemistry and the measurement of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) using headspace gas analysis. All waters had low pH (<5.3) and Gran alkalinity (<2.3 mg L-1), high DOC (>15 mg L-1), and were supersaturated with carbon dioxide (CO2) with respect to the atmosphere (CO2: 1.2-54 times atmospheric). Nonetheless, CO2 concentrations in the study lakes were significantly lower compared with surface water pools in associated fen systems. Average atmospheric flux of CO2 from the two lakes were 0.18 and 0.48 g C m (2) d (1), while potential fluxes from small surficial pools on the fen complexes were an order of magnitude higher. The higher average efflux estimated at one of the lakes (relative to the other) was attributed to shorter lake residence time and smaller relative lake area (i.e., higher relative carbon loading). Carbon mass balances for the lakes suggest that they act as conduits for dissolved CO2 from surrounding fen complexes to the atmosphere. In one of the two study catchments (with negligible groundwater sources), inputs of dissolved CO2 from fen surface waters supported a substantial component (similar to 30%) of the lake atmospheric CO2 efflux.

AB Inputs of mercury (Hg) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in throughfall and stemflow waters were measured for an upland/bog watershed in northern Minnesota, and were compared to the deposition in a nearby opening to determine the influence of tree canopies on Hg and DOC deposition. Twice as much Hg and seven times as much DOC was deposited in the forested watershed compared to the opening. Mass balance studies that are based on wet-only deposition in openings severely underestimate atmospheric deposition of Hg in forests. Conifer canopies are more efficient filters of airborne particulates than are deciduous canopies as indicated by much higher Hg concentrations and total deposition in throughfall and stemflow waters under conifers. Significant positive relationships existed between Hg and DOC in both throughfall (36-57% of the variation) and stemflow waters (55-88% of the variation). Hg complexation by DOC appears to be related to the contact time between precipitation and carbon sources.

AB Boreal peatland ecosystems occupy about 3.5 million km(2) of the earth's land surface and store between 250 and 455 Pg of carbon (C) as peat. While northern hemisphere boreal peatlands have functioned as net sinks for atmospheric C since the most recent deglaciation, natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and most importantly wildfire, may compromise peatland C sinks. To examine the effects of fire on local and regional C sink strength, we focused on a 12 000 km(2) region near Wabasca, AB, Canada, where ombrotrophic Sphagnum-dominated bogs cover 2280 km(2) that burn with a fire return interval of 123 +/- 26 years. We characterized annual C accumulation along a chronosequence of 10 bog sites, spanning 1-102 years-since-fire (in 2002). Immediately after fire, bogs represent a net C source of 8.9 +/- 8.4 mol m(-2) yr(-1). At about 13 years after fire, bogs switch from net C sources to net C sinks, mainly because of recovery of the moss and shrub layers. Subsequently, black spruce biomass accumulation contributes to the net C sink, with fine root biomass accumulation peaking at 34 years after fire and aboveground biomass and coarse root accumulation peaking at 74 years after fire. The overall C sink strength peaks at 18.4 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) at 75 years after fire. As the tree biomass accumulation rate declines, the net C sink decreases to about 10 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) at 100 years-since-fire. We estimate that across the Wabasca study region, bogs currently represent a C sink of 14.7 +/- 5.1 Gmol yr(-1). A decrease in the fire return interval to 61 years with no change in air temperature would convert the region's bogs to a net C source. An increase in nonwinter air temperature of 2 degrees C would decrease the regional C sink to 6.8 +/- 2.3 Gmol yr(-1). Under scenarios of predicted climate change, the current C sink status of Alberta bogs is likely to diminish to the point where these peatlands become net sources of atmospheric CO2-C.

AB In contrast to the situation in plants inhabiting most of the world's ecosystems, mycorrhizal fungi are usually absent from roots of the only two native vascular plant species of maritime Antarctica, Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis. Instead, a range of ascomycete fungi, termed dark septate endophytes (DSEs), frequently colonise the roots of these plant species. We demonstrate that colonisation of Antarctic vascular plants by DSEs facilitates not only the acquisition of organic nitrogen as early protein breakdown products, but also as non-proteinaceous d-amino acids and their short peptides, accumulated in slowly-decomposing organic matter, such as moss peat. Our findings suggest that, in a warming maritime Antarctic, this symbiosis has a key role in accelerating the replacement of formerly dominant moss communities by vascular plants, and in increasing the rate at which ancient carbon stores laid down as moss peat over centuries or millennia are returned to the atmosphere as CO2.

AB Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO,) in the atmosphere or continuous nitrogen (N) deposition might alter the carbon (C) cycle in boreal mires and thus have significant impacts on the development of climate change. The atmospheric impact of the C cycle in mires is twofold: C accumulation attenuates and CH4 release strengthens the natural greenhouse effect. We studied the effects of an increased supply of CO2 or NH4NO3 on the vegetation and annual CO2 exchange in lawns of a boreal oligotrophic mire in eastern Finland over a 2-year period. Ten study plots were enclosed with mini-FACE (Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment) rings. Five plots were vented with CO2-enriched air (target 560 ppmv), while their controls were vented with ambient air; five plots were sprayed with NH4NO3, corresponding to a cumulative addition of 3 g N M-2 a(-1), while their controls were sprayed with distilled water only. A raised NH4NO3 supply seemed to affect the composition of the moss layer. Raised CO2 did not affect the vegetation, but gross photosynthesis increased significantly. The change in net CO2 exchange depended on the annual weather conditions. Our results suggest that C accumulation may increase in wet years and compensate for the warming effect caused by the increase in CH4 release from this mire. In contrast, a relatively dry and warm growing period favors decomposition and can even make the CO2 balance negative. Along with the increased CH4 release under raised CO2 the decreased C accumulation then increases the radiative forcing of boreal mires.

AB Background: Successional paludification, a dynamic process that leads to the formation of peatlands, is influenced by climatic factors and site features such as surficial deposits and soil texture. In boreal regions, projected climate change and corresponding modifications in natural fire regimes are expected to influence the paludification process and forest development. The objective of this study was to forecast the development of boreal paludified forests in northeastern North America in relation to climate change and modifications in the natural fire regime for the period 2011-2100.
   Methods: A paludification index was built using static (e.g. surficial deposits and soil texture) and dynamic (e.g. moisture regime and soil organic layer thickness) stand scale factors available from forest maps. The index considered the effects of three temperature increase scenarios (i.e. + 1 degrees C, + 3 degrees C and + 6 degrees C) and progressively decreasing fire cycle (from 300 years for 2011-2041, to 200 years for 2071-2100) on peat accumulation rate and soil organic layer (SOL) thickness at the stand level, and paludification at the landscape level.
   Results: Our index show that in the context where in the absence of fire the landscape continues to paludify, the negative effect of climate change on peat accumulation resulted in little modification to SOL thickness at the stand level, and no change in the paludification level of the study area between 2011 and 2100. However, including decreasing fire cycle to the index resulted in declines in paludified area. Overall, the index predicts a slight to moderate decrease in the area covered by paludified forests in 2100, with slower rates of paludification.
   Conclusions: Slower paludification rates imply greater forest productivity and a greater potential for forest harvest, but also a gradual loss of open paludified stands, which could impact the carbon balance in paludified landscapes. Nonetheless, as the thick Sphagnum layer typical of paludified forests may protect soil organic layer from drought and deep burns, a significant proportion of the territory has high potential to remain a carbon sink.

AB Understanding how plant species respond to climate change is one of the great challenges in biodiversity conservation and sustainable ecosystem planning. Current studies of the impact of climate change on plants are biased to tracheophytes, i.e. vascular-plants. Only a few studies have been carried out on bryophytes despite the fact that they are ecologically equally important groups of embryophytes with their origins predating contemporary vascular-plants. Bryophytes fundamentally differ from vascular plants in their small size and utilization of a poikilohydric strategy for water and nutrients; their survival and reproduction are highly dependent on their external environment. Thus, the results from studies of tracheophytes cannot be generalized on bryophytes. In this review, we synthesize information about the influence of environmental factors on bryophytes to understand their relation to climate, especially to temperature on a global scale. We discuss a range of critical topics, including the responses of photosynthetic activities to temperature changes, and the consequences of temperature change on the interactions between bryophytes and vascular-plants, as well as on peatland ecosystems. As many species thrive in relatively low temperatures, with a low potential for short-term thermal acclimation to higher temperature in a hydrated state, elevated temperatures may shorten the time of metabolic activity, and increase desiccation intensity. This can bring significant physiological pressure on the survival of poikilohydric bryophytes. As a consequence of global warming, significant losses in bryophyte diversity can be expected, particularly in areas harbouring large number of species such as boreal forests of higher latitudes, alpine biomes and higher altitudes on tropical mountains. Furthermore, the decline of bryophyte diversity will ultimately lead to an alteration of ecosystem structure and function, nutrient cycling, and carbon balance. Further exploration of bryophyte ecophysiology in the changing environment, particularly the acclimation potential of photosynthesis and its biochemical and enzyme level basis to predicted changes in temperature will provide new knowledge that will assist bryophyte conservation.

AB Sphagnum mosses form a major component of northern peatlands, which are expected to experience substantially higher increases in temperature and winter precipitation than the global average. Sphagnum may play an important role in the responses of the global carbon cycle to climate change. We investigated the responses of summer length growth, carpet structure and production in Sphagnum fuscum to experimentally induced changes in climate in a sub-arctic bog. Thereto, we used open-top chambers (OTCs) to create six climate scenarios including changes in summer temperatures, and changes in winter snow cover and spring temperatures. In winter, the OTCs doubled the snow thickness, resulting in 0.5-2.8degreesC higher average air temperatures. Spring air temperatures in OTCs increased by 1.0degreesC. Summer warming had a maximum effect of 0.9degreesC, while vapor pressure deficit was not affected. The climate manipulations had strong effects on S. fuscum. Summer warming enhanced the length increment by 42-62%, whereas bulk density decreased. This resulted in a trend (P<0.10) of enhanced biomass production. Winter snow addition enhanced dry matter production by 33%, despite the fact that the length growth and bulk density did not change significantly. The addition of spring warming to snow addition alone did not significantly enhance this effect, but we may have missed part of the early spring growth. There were no interactions between the manipulations in summer and those in winter/spring, indicating that the effects were additive. Summer warming may in the long term negatively affect productivity through the adverse effects of changes in Sphagnum structure on moisture holding and transporting capacity. Moreover, the strong length growth enhancement may affect interactions with other mosses and vascular plants. Because winter snow addition enhanced the production of S. fuscum without affecting its structure, it may increase the carbon balance of northern peatlands.

AB The start of the period of large-scale human effects on this planet (the Anthropocene) is debated. The industrial view holds that most significant impacts have occurred since the early industrial era (similar to 1850), whereas the early-anthropogenic view recognizes large impacts thousands of years earlier. This review focuses on three indices of global-scale human influence: forest clearance (and related land use), emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4), and effects on global temperature. Because reliable, systematic land-use surveys are rare prior to 1950, most reconstructions for early-industrial centuries and prior millennia are hind casts that assume humans have used roughly the same amount of land per person for 7,000 years. But this assumption is incorrect. Historical data and new archeological databases reveal much greater per-capita land use in preindustrial than in recent centuries. This early forest clearance caused much greater preindustrial greenhouse-gas emissions and global temperature changes than those proposed within the industrial paradigm.

AB Stable isotope probing (SIP) is a method which attempts to link an organism's identity with its biological function under conditions approaching those in situ. Addition of C-13 labelled substrate to an environmental sample results in C-13 labelling of actively dividing bacteria when the C-13 labelled substrate is used as a carbon source. The microorganism's DNA therefore becomes heavier and can be separated by CsCI density gradient centrifugation from C-12 DNA of bacteria which have not assimilated labelled substrate. SIP has been applied to study the functionally active methanotroph population in peat soil, acidic forest soil, cave water and soda lake sediments. Studies have analysed both phylogenetic (16S rRNA) and functional (pmoA, mmoX and mxaF) genes to determine methanotroph diversity. These studies are reviewed here and the advantages and limitations of the SIP technique are discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Peat nutrient (nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) supply, net mineralization, groundwater concentrations, and peatland-atmosphere CO2 exchange rates were quantified within a poor fen bisected by a semi-permanent road located in the Athabasca Oil Sands region of Alberta, Canada, over one growing season. Results demonstrate that the road impeded groundwater movement across the site; however, water table and moisture differences were minimal, likely due to the unusually wet season. No clear impacts of the road on nutrient dynamics were observed, but subtle differences in productivity and respiration resulted in significantly lower net CO2 sequestration (net ecosystem exchange) on the down-flow side of the road. Differences in vegetation composition between sides of the road were apparent and likely indicate longer-term moisture differences at the site. Elevated rates of productivity and respiration coincided with a seasonal change in the relative supplies of N and P (increased N:P ratios), suggesting that the relative availability of N versus P may be important to CO2 fluxes in Western Boreal Plains peatlands. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the need to capture interactions between hydrology, ecology and nutrient biogeochemistry when evaluating peatland carbon cycling response to road disturbances across this region.

AB Hummock-hollow microtopography is common in the northern peatlands of the world, but its effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) components are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated effects of microtopography on SOC stocks and soil labile organic carbon (LOC) fractions in a sedge peatland in Changbai Mountain in northeast China. We found that SOC and soil LOC fractions had much heterogeneity in microtopography. SOC concentration in hummocks was significantly higher than under hummocks and in hollows. On average, the total SOC stock to a depth of 0.3 m below the ground surface was 19.00 kg C/m(2). Fifty six percent of the total SOC stock was stored in soils in and under hummocks, despite the hummock only covering 30% of the total area. Light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in hummocks were significantly higher than under hummocks and in hollows. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified that SOC explained most variations in soil LOC fractions (59.6%), followed by soil total phosphorus (7.4%) and soil water content (6.6%). Our findings indicate that the hummock is an important carbon pool in the sedge peatland. Hummock-hollow microtopography creates heterogeneity in hydrological conditions and soil physicochemical properties, and thus influences SOC stocks and soil LOC fractions at a small scale. This study highlights the importance of microtopography in carbon storage and cycling and has direct implications for the assessment of the carbon sequestration function in northern peatlands.

AB Coring and cutting devices were developed to extract 30 cm cores;from pear under conditions which preserve their physical/spatial integrity, maintain anoxic conditions and allow transverse sectioning. Methane production potential, measured on 1-2 cm vertical sections, was broadly absent from the upper 5 cm, maximum in the next 10 cm and thereafter declined. Methane oxidation potential was maximum in the upper 10 cm and thereafter detected in reducing amounts. Molecular methods, based on the extraction of total DNA and its PGR amplification and hybridisation with specific phylogenetic 16S rRNA and functional gene specific primers and probes, were developed to analyse the methane producing and methane oxidising microbial communities. The functional gene sequences were based on methanogen methyl coenzyme reductase and methanotroph methane monooxygenase. Methanotrophs are located throughout the core whereas methanogens are restricted to the lower zones. The composition of the microbial communities is however complex consisting of a number of novel species not previously recognised and with the various species/sub-groups occupying different vertical zones.

AB When investigating past peatland processes and related carbon cycle dynamics, it is essential to identify and separate different peat environments: bogs, fens and permafrost, and their historical plant assemblages. Bog peat layers contain relatively well-preserved plant material for palaeoecological examination, whereas fen and permafrost peats are often highly humified, which in turn constrains reconstructions of past plant assemblages. Here, we analysed the chemical composition of arctic peat plateau plants to create a local reference training-set of plant biomarkers. We then combined palaeobotanical, biogeochemical and chronological analyses to one permafrost peat sequence collected from the East European Russian tundra (67 degrees 03N, 62 degrees 57E) to investigate past peatland dynamics and to evaluate the performance of the biomarker method in a highly decomposed permafrost environment. The results show that the chronologically constrained macrofossil analysis provided most of the essential information about the peatland succession. However, a more robust reconstruction of the past peatland dynamics was achieved by combining palaeobotanical and biogeochemical data sets. The similarity of the lipid biomarker distributions of the arctic and boreal peatland plants also implies that any established modern biomarker training-set of peatland plants could be applied universally to palaeoecological studies on peat sediments.

AB Black carbon previously observed in peats has been attributed to various forms of pyrogenic carbon. However, a recent report has shown that a non-pyrogenic source of BC-like molecules can be obtained photochemically from dissolved organic matter. In this study, we examined well-known coal-forming peats located in the USA by solid-state C-13 NMR and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to evaluate the contribution of photochemically produced organic matter. The presence of photochemically produced organic matter was observed in all the peat samples and suggests that photochemically induced precipitation is pervasive. To determine if these "photo" materials survive maturation, we examined a low-rank coal from the Gippsland Basin, Australia, and the presence of "photo" materials was observed, indicating that these materials are geologically preserved. Results from this study indicate that photochemically produced materials are important sources of black carbon and aliphatic like compounds to coals and possibly Type III kerogens. It is possible that these materials are precursors to ubiquitously occurring fusinite, macrinite, micrinite, and related inertinite macerals in coal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the general assumption that nitrogen fixed by associated cyanobacteria will be readily utilised for growth by the Sphagnum, no empirical evidence is available in the literature. Therefore the effects of nitrogen transfer from cyanobacteria associated with S. riparium were investigated.
   Cultivation of S. riparium with and without cyanobacteria was performed under laboratory conditions for 57 days.
   We show that nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria associated with Sphagnum mosses, influences moss growth by transfer of fixed nitrogen to the moss. More than 35 % of the nitrogen fixed by cyanobacteria was transferred to the newly formed moss biomass and resulted in an increase in the growth of Sphagnum biomass compared to the controls. The variation in the increase of nitrogen content explained 76 % of the biomass increment.
   Hence, nitrogen fixation will have immediate effect on the carbon fixation by Sphagnum. This shows that factors regulating nitrogen fixation will have a direct effect on the role of Sphagnum dominated ecosystems with respect to carbon cycling.

AB Northern peatlands are important in the global carbon (C) cycle as they help regulate local, regional and global C budgets through high atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake and low net CO2 losses to the atmosphere. Since the 1900s (but particularly the 1950s) land-use change has affected many peatland areas, driven in part by attempts to improve their commercial value. During this period, many peatlands in the UK were drained and planted with non-native conifer plantations. Efforts are now underway to restore the ecosystem functioning of these peatlands to those characteristic of pristine peatlands, in particular C flux dynamics. A lack of ecosystem level measurements means that the timescales of restoration and the degree to which they are successful remains poorly determined. In this research, we present the first year-round study of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) from peatlands undergoing restoration from forestry. Annual NEE was measured from two sites between March 2014 and June 2015, where restoration commenced 10 years and 16 years prior to the start of this study, and the results were then compared to existing measurements from a near-pristine peatland. Existing NEE data (expressed as CO2-C) from the near-pristine peatland indicated a C sink of 114 g m(-2) yr(-1), and our estimates suggest that the older restored site (16 years) was also a NEE sink (71 g m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the younger site (10 years) was a NEE source (80 g m(-2) yr(-1)). We critically assess the confidence of these measurements and also present these data in relation to other northern hemisphere peatlands to better understand the timeframe in which a peatland site can turn from a C source to a C sink after restoration.

AB Strain DMS-SI isolated from seawater was able to utilize dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as a sulfur source only in the presence of light in a sulfur-lacking medium. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S ribosomal DNA genes indicated that the strain was closely related to Marinobacterium georgiense. The strain produced dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which was a main metabolite, and small amounts of formate and formaldehyde when grown on DMS as the sole sulfur source. The cells of the strain grown with succinate as a carbon source were able to use methyl mercaptan or methanesulfonate besides DMS but not DMSO or dimethyl sulfone as a sole sulfur source. DMS was transformed to DMSO primarily at wavelengths between 380 and 480 nm by heat-stable photosensitizers released by the strain. DMS was also degraded to formaldehyde in the presence of light by unidentified heat-stable factors released by the strain, and it appeared that strain DMS-S1 used the degradation products, which should be sulfite, sulfate, or methanesulfonate, as sulfur sources.

AB Drained riparian wetlands have been rewetted and restored in recent decades to remove nutrients, increase biodiversity, and mitigate soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Yet, few studies have documented the long-term effects of rewetting on complete greenhouse gas (GHG) balances including emissions of CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Here, we report the complete annual GHG balance of an extensively managed riparian wetland, dominated by creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), 12 years after rewetting. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was measured by transparent closed chambers, and fluxes were partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) for modelling and extrapolation to annual emissions based on photosynthetically active radiation, ratio vegetation index and temperature. Fluxes of CH4 and N2O were monitored with opaque chambers. Groundwater table (GWT) was close to soil surface for most of the growing period, whereas the site was inundated during winter. Biomass was cut in late summer (8.5 Mg dry weight ha(-1)), but left on-site according to current management in the area. Annual ER (1360 g CO2-Cm-2) exceeded GPP (-1140 g CO2-Cm-2), and the ecosystem was a net source of CO2 with NEE of 220 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1). However, fluxes of CH4 (53 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) dominated the annual GHG balance with 405 g CO2-C-eq m(-2) yr(-1) which contributed 60% to the total GHG balance. Fluxes of N2O were primarily found at times of changing GWT with annual emission of 0.7 g N2O m(-2) (50 g CO2-C-eq m(-2)) equal to 7% of the complete GHG balance. With proper management, rewetting and restoration of wetlands is expected to eventually resume the carbon sink function of natural wetlands, but this was not found in the present study as net fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 were positive. This was mainly attributed to on-site deposition of biomass which apparently stimulated both CO2 and CH4 emissions and partly reduced GPP by acting as a mulch layer. Future studies should focus on managements that increase CO2 uptake and biomass yield, and at the same time reduce CH4 emissions; such managements should avoid on-site deposition of aboveground biomass at rewetted sites.

AB Reservoirs are sources of greenhouses gases to the atmosphere, primarily due to organic carbon mineralization in flooded plants and soils to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Floating peat islands are common in reservoirs that inundated peatlands. These islands can decompose on mass, or small pieces of peat can erode from islands to decompose in the water column or on the bottom of reservoirs. Here we used large 450 liter sealed enclosures to measure mineralization rates of small peat pieces and larger peat blocks collected from floating peat islands. Mineralization rates were calculated by quantifying dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 and CH4 accumulation within the water and headspace of the enclosures over time. We found that peat did decompose under water, but rates of mineralization of peat pieces were not different than rates of mineralization of larger peat blocks. Mineralization rates ranged between 59 and 140 mug C g(-1) d(-1). Peat pieces acidified the water, shifting the bicarbonate equilibrium to almost exclusively dissolved CO2, which was then readily able to flux to the atmosphere. We estimated that 2.4-5.6% of peat carbon was mineralized annually, suggesting that fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from reservoirs that flood peatlands could last at minimum 18-42 years from this carbon source alone.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange was studied at flark (minerotrophic hollow), lawn and hummock microsites in an oligotrophic boreal pine fen. Statistical response functions were constructed for the microsites in order to reconstruct the annual CO2 exchange balance from climate data. Carbon accumulation was estimated from the annual net CO2 exchange, methane (CH4) emissions and leaching of carbon. Due to high water tables in the year 1993, the average carbon accumulation at the flark, Eriophorum lawn, Carex lawn and hummock microsites was high, 2.91, 6.08, 2.83 and 2.66 mol C m(-2) respectively, and for the whole peatland it was 5.66 mol m(-2) year(-1). During the maximum primary production period in midsummer, hummocks with low water tables emitted less methane than predicted from the average net ecosystem exchange (NEE), while the Carer lawns emitted slightly more. CH4 release during that period corresponded to 16% of the contemporary NEE. Annual C accumulation rate did not correlate with annual CH4 release in the microsites studied, but the total community CO2 release seemed to be related to CH4 emissions in the wet microsites, again excluding the hummocks. The dependence of CO2 exchange dynamics on weather events suggests that daily balances in C accumulation are labile and can change from net carbon uptake to net release, primarily in high hummocks on fens under warmer, drier climatic conditions.

AB Forested wetlands are an important carbon (C) sink. Fine roots (diameter < 2 mm) dominate belowground C cycling and can be functionally defined into absorptive roots (order 1-2) and transport roots (order >= 3). However, effects of microtopography on the function-based fine root dynamics in forested wetlands are poorly understood. We studied fine root biomass allocation and biomass, necromass, mass loss rate, production, mortality and decomposition of absorptive and transport roots in hummocks and hollows in a coastal plain freshwater forested wetland (FFW) in the southeastern USA using dynamic-flow method. Biomass ratios of first- to second-order roots and absorptive to transport roots and the biomass and necromass of absorptive and transport roots were significantly higher in top 0-10 cm organic peat layer than in 10-20 cm muck and mineral layer, and were significantly higher in hummocks than in hollows. The mass loss rate, production, mortality and decomposition were significantly higher in hummocks than in hollows. Absorptive roots did not have a lower mass loss rate than transport roots. Microtopography significantly affected the contributions of absorptive and transport roots to the total production, mortality and decomposition. Production, mortality and decomposition of absorptive roots were higher than those of transport roots in hummocks but lower than those of transport roots in hollows. Total (hummocks plus hollows) fine root production, mortality and decomposition were 455 +/- 106 g m(-2) y(-1), 475 +/- 79 g m(-2) y(-1)and 392 +/- 60 g m(-2) y(-1), respectively. Greater mortality than decomposition resulted in net fine root C input to soil. The observed microtopographic controls on fine root dynamics have great implications for soil C cycling. As sea level rises, the relative area of hollows in coastal plain FFWs will increase, causing a decrease in fine root mass loss rate, biomass, production, mortality and decomposition and it is the balance of these processes that will determine future soil C storage and cycling.

AB Turnover rates of soil carbon for 20 soil types typical for a 3.7 million km(2) area of European Russia were estimated based on C-14 data. The rates are corrected for bomb radiocarbon which strongly affects the topsoil C-14 balance. The approach is applied for carbon stored in the organic and mineral layers of the upper 1 m of the soil profile. The turnover rates carbon in the upper 20 cm are relatively high for forest soils (0.16-0.78% yearmediate for tundra soils (0.25% year(-1)), and low for grassland soils (0.02-0.08% year(-1)) with the exception of southern Chernozems (0.32% year(-1)). In the soil layer of 20-100 cm depth, the turnover rates were much lower for all soil types (0.01-0.06% year(-1)) except for peat bog soils of the southern taiga (0.14% year(-1)). Combined with a map of soil type distribution and a dataset of several hundred soil carbon profiles, the method provides annual fluxes for the slowest components of soil carbon assuming that the latter is in equilibrium with climate and vegetation cover. The estimated carbon flux from the soil is highest for forest soils (12-147 gC/(m(2) year)), intermediate for tundra soils (33 gC/(m(2) year)), and lowest for grassland soils (1-26 gC/(m(2) year)). The approach does not distinguish active and recalcitrant carbon fractions and this explains the low turnover rates in the top layer. Since changes in soil types will follow changes in climate and land cover, we suggest that pedogenesis is an important factor influencing the future dynamics of soil carbon fluxes. Up to now, both the effect of soil type changes and the clear evidence from C-14 measurements that most soil organic carbon has a millennial time scale, are basically neglected in the global carbon cycle models used for projections of atmospheric CO2 in 21st century and beyond.

AB Complementary to measurements in Antarctic ice cores, stomatal frequency analysis of leaves of land plants preserved in peat and lake deposits can provide a proxy record of preindustrial atmospheric CO2 concentration. CO2 trends based on leaf remains of Quercus robur (English oak) from the Netherlands support the presence of significant CO2 variability during the first half of the last millennium. The amplitude of the reconstructed multidecadal fluctuations, up to 34 parts per million by volume, considerably exceeds maximum shifts measured in Antarctic ice. Inferred changes in CO2 radiative forcing are of a magnitude similar to variations ascribed to other mechanisms, particularly solar irradiance and volcanic activity, and may therefore call into question the concept of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assumes an insignificant role of CO2 as a preindustrial climate-forcing factor. The stomata-based CO2 trends correlate with coeval sea-surface temperature trends in the North Atlantic Ocean, suggesting the possibility of an oceanic source/sink mechanism for the recorded CO2 changes.

AB Stable carbon isotope values of organic carbon have proven useful in identification of the salinity regime of marsh deposits in the Mississippi Delta plain. Using a mixing model and empirical measurements of the delta(13)C of marsh sediments, we show that carbon isotope analysis could be a useful technique on other coastlines. Estimates of the stable carbon isotope values from estuarine deposits along the west and east coast of the United States suggest that fresh and saline sediments each have a characteristic ''signature.'' Thus, stable carbon isotope values can provide valuable evidence of sea level fluctuations in these regions. Values of delta(13)C which depart from the predictive model could be caused by diagenetic processes (decomposition) and/or contribution from carbon sources not accounted for in the model. In assessing the relative importance of these factors, we find that complications are minimized when autochthonous carbon from algal production is not an important component of the sedimentary Organic matter.

AB Herbivory by barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) alters the vegetation cover and reduces ecosystem productivity in high-Arctic peatlands, limiting the carbon sink strength of these ecosystems. Here we investigate how herbivory-induced vegetation changes affect the activities of peat soil microbiota using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and targeted metabolomics in a comparison of fenced exclosures and nearby grazed sites. Our results show that a different vegetation with a high proportion of vascular plants developed due to reduced herbivory, resulting in a larger and more diverse input of polysaccharides to the soil at exclosed study sites. This coincided with higher sugar and amino acid concentrations in the soil at this site as well as the establishment of a more abundant and active microbiota, including saprotrophic fungi with broad substrate ranges, like Helotiales (Ascomycota) and Agaricales (Basidiomycota). A detailed description of fungal transcriptional profiles revealed higher gene expression for cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin and chitin degradation at herbivory-exclosed sites. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the number of genes and transcripts for predatory eukaryotes such as Entomobryomorpha (Arthropoda). We conclude that in the absence of herbivory, the development of a vascular vegetation alters the soil polysaccharide composition and supports larger and more active populations of fungi and predatory eukaryotes.

AB We examined the effect of cation treatments on methanogenic activity and nutrient release from exchange sites in raised bog and fen peats. Treatments consisted of cation chloride solutions (MgCl2, AlCl3 and PbCl2) applied individually. In raised bog peat Al3+ and Pb2+ increased CH4 production. A correlation was found between CH4 production and the amount of micro- and macronutrient cations released by the treatments. In calcareous fen peat, such a stimulation was also found, but there was no correlation between CH4 production and micro and macronutrient release. Direct nutrient and pH effects could not account for these observations. Thus the results support the hypothesis that the methanogenic community in the raised bog is limited by the availability of mineral nutrients and/or inactivity of exo-enzymes, both of which are bound onto exchange sites.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key component of the carbon cycle and has significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems and potable water treatment. Upward trends in river and lacaustrine DOC concentrations have been observed and a number of key drivers have been proposed. Here, we present DOC concentration data from plot scale pore waters at one site and surface water from artificial drains sampled within a national survey which demonstrate a significant correlation between peatland vegetation type and DOC concentration. Calluna dominance was associated with the highest DOC concentration, Molinia and Sphagnum dominance with lower concentrations, and sedge dominance with intermediate concentrations. Water sampled from drains dominated by Calluna had greater DOC concentrations than water sampled from pore waters in plots dominated by Calluna. In contrast DOC concentrations from plots dominated by sedges were greater than those sampled from drains dominated by sedges. We discuss these findings in relation to plant functional traits and their influence on the physical and biotic conditions that regulate DOC concentrations. Given the known effects of management activities and climate change on peatland vegetation composition there is potential to manage plant community composition to ameliorate the observed rising DOC concentration.

AB 1. In central Siberia Pinus sylvestris forests and bogs are common elements of the landscape and they show different functional behaviour in terms of energy and carbon exchanges.
   2. The two ecosystems show a remarkable difference in energy dissipation, with average Bowen ratios of 0.6 and 2.9, respectively.
   3. The alternation of bogs and forests with different energy partition at the surface could affect rainfall distribution and the disturbance regimes (lightening and fires) and drive the ecology of such a complex landscape.
   4. During summer, water shortage and poor nutrient conditions in the soil heavily affect carbon exchange rates of the regenerating forest (- 7.7 mmol m(-2) day(-1)). Consequently the bog becomes a significant dominant carbon sequestration element of this particular landscape with higher rates of carbon uptake (- 104.2 mmol m(-2) day(-1)).

AB In the UK, as organo-mineral soils are a significant store of soil organic carbon (SOC), they may become increasingly favoured for the expansion of upland forestry. It is important, therefore, to assess the likely impacts on SOC of this potentially major land use change. Currently, these assessments rely on modelling approaches which assume that afforestation of organo-mineral soils is 'carbon neutral'. This review evaluates this assumption in two ways. Firstly, UK information from the direct measurement of SOC change following afforestation is examined in the context of international studies. Secondly, UK data on the magnitude and direction of the major fluxes in the carbon cycle of semi-natural upland ecosystems are assessed to identify the likely responses of the fluxes to afforestation of organo-mineral soils. There are few directly relevant measurements of SOC change following afforestation of organo-mineral soils in the UK uplands but there are related studies on peat lands and agricultural soils. Overall, information on the magnitude and direction of change in SOC with afforestation is inconclusive. Data on the accumulation of litter beneath conifer stands have been identified but the extent to which the carbon held in this pool is incorporated into the stable soil carbon reservoir is uncertain. The effect of afforestation on most carbon fluxes is small because the fluxes are either relatively minor or of the same magnitude and direction irrespective of land use. Compared with undisturbed moorland, particulate organic carbon losses increase throughout the forest cycle but the data are exclusively from plantation conifer forests and in many cases pre-date current industry best practice guidelines which aim to reduce such losses. The biggest uncertainty in flux estimates is the relative magnitude of the sink for atmospheric carbon as trees grow and mature compared with that lost during site preparation and harvesting. Given the size of this flux relative to many of the others, this should be a focus for future carbon research on these systems.

AB Open-water mire pools play an important role in sustaining biodiversity. However, many mire pools have disappeared by artificial drainage all over the world. This study aimed at exploring how mire pools are changed by artificial drainage in terms of open water area and vegetation in Shizukari Mire, Hokkaido. We analyzed the changes of drainage ditches and open water of mire pools using multi-temporal aerial photographs. In order to elucidate how pool plant communities change by drainage, we analyzed the vegetation on the persisting pools and drained area of former pools. Our results indicated that most pools were lost soon after digging of ditches, and the remaining pools have shrunk by more diffuse, continued drainage effect. Due to open water loss, pool plant communities were considered to change towards the plant communities of drier conditions, comprising woody plants and non-wetland plant species. If the drainage continues, the remaining mire pools will ultimately disappear and the species composition of the mire could become more homogenous, being dominated by few species with high coverage.

AB The micrometeorological technique of conditional sampling has been used to measure the surface-atmosphere exchange of a number of radiatively active trace gases. This paper reviews the design and operational details of a system developed as part of the NERC TIGER programme. The system has been used to measure the exchange of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, total hydrocarbons and nonmethane hydrocarbons. The necessary modifications to the basic system are described which permit such a wide range of compounds to be measured and typical flux estimates are given. The paper also includes some discussion of the relative sensitivity of the technique and suggests areas for future research to improve the stability and practicality of systems employing the conditional sampling approach.

AB We used electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) to identify the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected from different ecosystems along a transect crossing Siberia's northern and middle Taiga. This information is urgently needed to help elucidate global carbon cycling and export through Russian rivers. In total, we analyzed DOM samples from eleven Yenisei tributaries and seven bogs. Freeze-dried and re-dissolved DOM was desalted via solid phase extraction (SPE) and eluted in methanol for ESI-FT-ICR- MS measurements. We recorded 15209 different masses and identified 7382 molecular formulae in the mass range between m/z = 150 and 800. We utilized the relative FT-ICR-MS signal intensities of 3384 molecular formulae above a conservatively set limit of detection and summarized the molecular characteristics for each measurement using ten magnitudeweighted parameters ((O/C)(w), (H/C)(w), (N/C)(w), (DBE)(w), (DBE/C)(w), (DBE/O)(w), (DBE-O) w, (C#) w, (MW) w and (AI) w) for redundancy analysis. Consequently, we revealed that the molecular composition of DOM depends mainly on pH and geographical latitude. After applying variation partitioning to the peak data, we isolated molecular formulae that were strongly positive or negatively correlated with latitude and pH. We used the chemical information from 13 parameters (C#, H#, N#, O#, O/C, H/C, DBE, DBE/C, DBE/O, AI, N/C, DBE-O and MW) to characterize the extracted molecular formulae. Using latitude along the gradient representing climatic variation, we found a higher abundance of smaller molecules, nitrogen-containing compounds and unsaturated C=C functionalities at higher latitudes. As possible reasons for the different molecular characteristics occurring along this gradient, we suggested that the decomposition was temperature dependent resulting to a higher abundance of non-degraded lignin-derived phenolic substances. We demonstrated that bog samples, which were differentiated from river samples by their lower pH values, distinguish themselves by their higher unsaturation and molecular size. These molecular characteristics might suggest less phenol oxidase degradation occurs alongside a higher abundance of phenolic substances in bogs due to low pH and anoxic conditions. We concluded that heating at the higher latitudes will increase decomposition and feedback on the nitrogen cycle due to the increased mineralization of organic nitrogen compounds, although the peat system will be less affected due to pH inhibition.

AB Yamulki and co-authors address in their recent publication the important issue of net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from peatlands where land use conversion has taken place. In their case, they studied conversion to forestry versus peatland restoration after a first rotation of plantation forestry. They monitored soil-derived fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) using opaque chamber measurements on planted and unplanted control treatments (with or without drainage), and an unplanted plot within a restored (felled) block on former lowland raised bog. They propose that their measurements of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at these sites suggest that the total net GHG emissions, in 100 yr carbon dioxide equivalents, of the restored peat bog would be higher than that of the peat bog with trees. We believe there are a number of issues with the measurement, calculation and comparison of these greenhouse budgets that may invalidate this conclusion.

AB Siberian mires, especially the world's largest coherent bogs of the Great Vasyugan Mire (Tomsk Region, West Siberian Plain, Russia), play an important role in the regional hydrological cycle, global carbon balance and influence flow formation of the region's rivers. We revealed the role of natural mires in supplying water to a mire-dominated (80% of the river basin area) Siberian catchment of the Klyuch River that represents typical features of the headwater catchment of the Great Vasyugan Mire, the world's largest mire in natural and well-preserved conditions. Our research protocol involved an analysis of the electric conductivity of peat water along selected transects of the mire, analysis of groundwater levels and river discharge and electric conductivity of the river water. We used ground-penetrating radar to determine the structure of the peat. We revealed that the examined part of the mire depends solely on the rainwater supply and that minerotrophic groundwater is not present within the area of the research. Average groundwater levels within the mire in the period 2013-2018 reached 0.193 m b.g.l. We also revealed that the natural drainage of mire water does not sustain river discharge throughout the whole year. This means the Klyuch remains an intermittent river dependent on the natural outflow of the mire's waters, after exceeding the mire's critical water retention volume. Total retention volume of a mire depends on the peat's physical features and the mire's short-term response to excessive thaw and precipitation events. An analysis of river discharge duration curves demonstrated that river discharge can be sustained by the duration reaching from 0.39 up to 0.71 in a year, in dry and wet years, respectively. We concluded that in a specific hydrogeological setup of the mire-river system, natural ombrotrophic mires cannot be considered as systems with a continuous water supply and discharge stabilization. We concluded that the Hortonian vision of infiltration and discharge is not valid in bog dominated basins. In the face of climatic changes in Siberia, we foresee a decrease in the discharge volume from the headwaters of rivers and the increase of river intermittence which may affect total outflow volume, specifically in the upper Ob and Irtysh, by reducing the contribution of surface runoff.

AB Lignicolous freshwater fungi represent one of the largest groups of Ascomycota. This taxonomically highly diverse group plays an important role in nutrient and carbon cycling, biological diversity and ecosystem functioning. The diversity of lignicolous freshwater fungi along a north-south latitudinal gradient is currently being studied in Asia. In this paper, we introduce two novel freshwater taxa viz. Tingoldiago hydei sp. nov. and T. clavata sp. nov. which were collected from freshwater substrates in Eastern Thailand. Morphological comparison based on the size of ascomata, asci and ascospores, as well as multi-gene phylogenetic analyses based on LSU, SSU, ITS and TEF1-alpha DNA sequences, supports their placement in Tingoldiago (Lentitheciaceae). Descriptions and illustrations of these two new species are provided.

AB Peat extraction leaves a land surface with a strong relief of deep cutover areas and higher ridges. Rewetting inundates the deep parts, while less deeply extracted zones remain at or above the water level. In temperate fens the flooded areas are colonized by helophytes such as Eriophorum angustifolium, Carex spp., Typha latifolia or Phragmites australis dependent on water depth. Reeds of Typha and Phragmites are reported as large sources of methane, but data on net CO2 uptake are contradictory for Typha and rare for Phragmites. Here, we analyze the effect of vegetation, water level and nutrient conditions on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for representative vegetation types along water level gradients at two rewetted cutover fens (mesotrophic and eutrophic) in Belarus. Greenhouse gas emissions were measured campaign-wise with manual chambers every 2 to 4 weeks for 2 years and interpolated by modelling.
   All sites had negligible nitrous oxide exchange rates. Most sites were carbon sinks and small GHG sources. Methane emissions generally increased with net ecosystem CO2 uptake. Mesotrophic small sedge reeds with water table around the land surface were small GHG sources in the range of 2.3 to 4.2 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr(-1). Eutrophic tall sedge -Typha latifolia reeds on newly formed floating mats were substantial net GHG emitters in the range of 25.1 to 39.1 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr. They represent transient vegetation stages. Phragmites reeds ranged between -1.7 to 4.2 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr(-1) with an overall mean GHG emission of 1.3 tCO(2) eq.ha(-1) yr(-1). The annual CO2 balance was best explained by vegetation biomass, which includes the role of vegetation composition and species. Methane emissions were obviously driven by biological activity of vegetation and soil organisms.
   Shallow flooding of cutover temperate fens is a suitable measure to arrive at low GHG emissions. Phragmites australis establishment should be promoted in deeper flooded areas and will lead to moderate, but variable GHG emissions or even occasional sinks. The risk of large GHG emissions is higher for eutrophic than mesotrophic peatlands. Nevertheless, flooding of eutrophic temperate fens still represents a safe GHG mitigation option because even the hotspot of our study, the floating tall sedge - Typha latifolia reeds, did not exceed the typical range of GHG emissions from drained fen grasslands and the spatially dominant Phragmites australis reed emitted by far less GHG than drained fens.

AB The vast boreal biome plays an important role in the global carbon cycle but is experiencing particularly rapid climate warming, threatening the integrity of valued ecosystems and their component species. We developed a framework and taxonomy to identify climate-change refugia potential in the North American boreal region, summarizing current knowledge regarding mechanisms, geographic distribution, and landscape indicators. While "terrain-mediated" refugia will mostly be limited to coastal and mountain regions, the ecological inertia (resistance to external fluctuations) contained in some boreal ecosystems may provide more extensive buffering against climate change, resulting in "ecosystem-protected" refugia. A notable example is boreal peatlands, which can retain high surface soil moisture and water tables even in the face of drought. Refugia from wildfire are also especially important in the boreal region, which is characterized by active disturbance regimes. Our framework will help identify areas of high refugia potential, and inform ecosystem management and conservation planning in light of climate change.

AB Peatlands cover only about 3% the global land area, but store about twice as much carbon as global forest biomass. If intact peatlands are drained for agriculture or other human uses, peat oxidation can result in considerable CO(2)emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) for decades or even centuries. Despite their importance, emissions from degraded peatlands have so far not been included explicitly in mitigation pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement. Such pathways include land-demanding mitigation options like bioenergy or afforestation with substantial consequences for the land system. Therefore, besides GHG emissions owing to the historic conversion of intact peatlands, the increased demand for land in current mitigation pathways could result in drainage of presently intact peatlands, e.g. for bioenergy production. Here, we present the first quantitative model-based projections of future peatland dynamics and associated GHG emissions in the context of a 2 degrees C mitigation pathway. Our spatially explicit land-use modelling approach with global coverage simultaneously accounts for future food demand, based on population and income projections, and land-based mitigation measures. Without dedicated peatland policy and even in the case of peatland protection, our results indicate that the land system would remain a net source of CO(2)throughout the 21st century. This result is in contrast to the outcome of current mitigation pathways, in which the land system turns into a net carbon sink by 2100. However, our results indicate that it is possible to reconcile land use and GHG emissions in mitigation pathways through a peatland protectionandrestoration policy. According to our results, the land system would turn into a global net carbon sink by 2100, as projected by current mitigation pathways, if about 60% of present-day degraded peatlands would be rewetted in the coming decades, next to the protection of intact peatlands.

AB About a quarter of the global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to agriculture, forestry and other land use. Few studies of afforested drained peatlands have measured exchanges of all three major greenhouse gases (GHG) at a given site, leading to uncertainty in estimated GHG budgets. Thus, we measured forest floor exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at a well-drained afforested peatland in southern Sweden. The CO2 emissions (76000 kg ha(-1) a(-1); SE 6000) were large compared with previous measurements at similar sites, which may have been partly due to a measurement technique that did not underestimate the flux. A net CH4 uptake of 4.4 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.41) and a net N2O emission of 2.7 kg ha(-1) a(-1) (SE 0.23) were found, which agreed well with published models relating fluxes to stand biomass (CH4 models) or soil C:N ratio (N2O models).

AB Accurate projections of climate change impacts on the vast carbon stores of northern peatlands require detailed knowledge of ecosystem respiration (ER) and its heterotrophic (Rh) and autotrophic (Ra) components. Currently, however, standard flux measurement techniques, i.e. eddy covariance and manual chambers, generate empirical ER data during only night- or daytime, respectively, which are extrapolated to the daily scale based on the paradigm that assumes a uniform diel temperature response. Here, using continuous autochamber measurements, we demonstrate a distinct bimodal pattern in diel peatland ER which contrasts the unimodal pattern inherent to the classical assumption. This feature results from divergent temperature dependencies of day- and nighttime ER due to varying contributions from Rh and Ra. We further find that disregarding these bimodal dynamics causes significant bias in ER estimates across multiple temporal scales. This calls for improved process-based understanding of ER to advance our ability to simulate peatland carbon cycle-climate feedbacks.

AB Despite the importance of forested wetland in the global carbon cycle, no widely applicable ecosystem model exists for this ecosystem. This study reports the linkage between Wetland-DNDC and MIKE SHE for carbon dynamics and GHGs mitigation strategies analyses in forested wetland. Wetland-DNDC was modified by parameterizing forest management practices and refining anaerobic biogeochemical processes. Mortality due to senescence was estimated as a function of tree age or as a function of the relative biomass. We used a harvesting damage mortality coefficient as a linear function of time with three parameters: Initial mortality, Duration of the damage and Intensity of the initial harvesting. The model was validated against experimental data obtained from the GNF site near Florida. As a preliminary application, we simulated the effect of water table position and forest management practices on GHGs emissions and carbon dynamics to test the capabilities of the models for simulating seasonal and long-term carbon budget in forested wetland.

AB Transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from land to water is an important but poorly known component of northern carbon cycles. We examined seasonal patterns of arctic river DOC flux, focusing on the largely uncharacterized snowmelt period. High-intensity sampling of the Kolyma River showed rapid increases in DOC concentration during peak discharge, yielding unique DOC-water flux relationships compared to summer, fall and winter. Our annual DOC flux estimates were 31% higher than previous estimates for the basin based on few or no snowmelt samples. Synthesis of the sparse literature show that 55% of arctic river DOC flux occurs during snowmelt. Biogeochemical characterizations of DOC in large rivers are usually done after snowmelt runoff, and are thus unrepresentative of most DOC transported to the Arctic Ocean. Finally, the proportion of annual DOC flux at snowmelt is considerably higher than for water, suggesting that cold season production is an important but little known process regulating arctic DOC transport.

AB Conflicting hypotheses are investigated for the observed atmospheric CO2 increase of 20 ppm between 8 ka BP and pre-industrial time. The carbon component of the Bern Carbon Cycle Climate (Bern CC) model, which couples the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model to an atmosphere-ocean-sediment component, is driven by climate fields from time-slice simulations of the past 21 ka with the Hadley Centre Unified Model or the NCAR Climate System Model. The entire Holocene ice core record of CO2 is matched within a few ppm for the standard model setup, and results are broadly consistent with proxy data of atmospheric (CO2)-C-13, mean ocean delta(13)C, and pollen data, within their uncertainties. Our analysis suggests that a range of mechanisms, including calcite compensation in response to earlier terrestrial uptake, terrestrial carbon uptake and release, SST changes, and coral reef buildup, contributed to the 20 ppm rise. The deep sea delta(13)C record constrains the contribution of the calcite compensation mechanism to 4-10 ppm. Terrestrial carbon inventory changes related to climate and CO2 forcing, the greening of the Sahara, peat buildup, and land use have probably influenced atmospheric CO2 by a few ppm only. The early Holocene CO2 decrease is quantitatively explained by terrestrial uptake and calcite compensation in response to terrestrial uptake during the glacial-interglacial transition. The recent hypothesis by Ruddiman [2003] that anthropogenic land use caused a 40 ppm CO2 anomaly over the past 8 ka, preventing the climate system from entering a new glacial, would imply an anthropogenic emission of 700 GtC and a decrease in atmospheric delta(13)C of 0.6 permil. This is not compatible with the ice core delta(13)C record and would require an upward revision of land use emission estimates by a factor of 3 to 4.

AB Fungi are a highly diverse group of organisms and play a significant role in decomposition and carbon cycling in boreal ecosystems. To determine how fungal communities are structured in peat bogs and how to obtain representative samples for monitoring fungal community changes, we separately sampled and sequenced (ITS2, Illumina MiSeq) peat, mixed litter and litter from individual dominant plant species in five permanent plots in raised bogs in the Jizerske Hory Mountains (Czech Republic). In total, we detected 68-103 OTUs per plot. The fungal assemblages were mostly influenced by substrate identity, whereas the effect of the site was minimal. Only a few identified OTUs behave like generalists. The most specific fungi were found in dead parts of Cantina yidgaris, Trichophorum cespitosum and Drosera rotundifolia. The high substrate heterogeneity means that sequencing soil core samples does not provide an exhaustive inventory of the fungal diversity in bogs. Poor correspondence was observed between the recorded OTUs and either visually inspected fruitbodies or literature reports on the fungal taxa associated with the analysed substrates.

AB Peat lands are the most efficient carbon stores of all terrestrial ecosystems, containing approximately 455 Pg of carbon, which is twice the amount found in the world's forest biomass. The majority of this carbon is stored in the saturated peat soil. Pristine peatlands are still sequestering carbon at a rate of 0.096 Pg carbon per year; however, anthropogenic degradation of peatlands through draining, fires and exploitation can increase the production of GHGs, switching peatlands from net sinks to net sources of carbon. Conservation of peatlands throughout the UK and the rest of the world is clearly essential for limiting GHG emissions and it is therefore surprising that accounting for emissions from peatlands does not feature prominently in the UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol. Discussions at Conference of the Parties (COP) COP-15 and COP-16 look set to make amends for this oversight in any post-2012 climate change legislation, with peatlands becoming important factors in national GHG inventories, the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector, and in the creation of internationally accredited carbon credits. Using figures from The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), the world's peatlands can be valued at up to US$18 billion. However, this sum does not take into account pending UNFCCC decisions. The detailed mandatory inclusion of peatlands in national GHG inventory schemes and in accredited carbon markets could see their value rise even further. This review looks at the current GHG emission-monitoring legislation regarding peatlands, with special focus given to those in the UK. It discusses the importance of peatlands in carbon sequestration, reviews how peatlands feature in current GHG emission-monitoring schemes, concentrating on those associated with the Kyoto Protocol, and considers how peatlands may feature in national GHG emission-monitoring schemes and carbon markets in the future.

AB The residual signals of the physical and chemical processes undergone in a river basin are stored in the isotopic composition of river water and are used here to isolate and quantify fluxes of water, energy and carbon for a large boreal river basin. The integrated nature of the river signal is exploited to provide meaningful basin-wide annual averages for fluxes difficult to quantify and extrapolate by studying highly variable interface exchanges at discrete locations. The slope of the linear regression of deuterium (delta D) and oxygen (delta(18)O) isotopes for the Ottawa River is similar to 6.0, considerably less than the slope of the local meteoric water line (7.7). This discrepancy is a consequence of evaporative loss from open water bodies and soils and, through a new method, is calculated to be 8.1% of annual precipitation. As well, on the basis of thirty years of daily meteorological and discharge data, annual evapotranspiration for the Ottawa River basin is calculated to be 53.1%. Combining the evaporation and evapotranspiration calculations apportions 45% of the water losses to transpiration. The energy required to drive these cycles is calculated to be 8% of annual solar radiation for total evapotranspiration and 13% of growing season solar radiation for transpiration. These energies are transformed into latent heat. The water use efficiency ratio is used to estimate total fixation of carbon (gross primary production (GPP)) for the basin at 15.6 mol C m(-2) yr(-1). This rate is substantially greater than the export of carbon via rivers plus rates estimated for carbon respiration in the literature, indicating that the boreal forest is a plausible component of the postulated "missing" carbon sink. Comparison of accumulation rates of C in peatlands and the rates required to account for the missing sink suggest that peat accumulation rates are similar to 20 times too slow to account for the missing sink flux. Speculatively, the living biomass of the boreal forest is the dominant sink. Accepting this, the respiration rate needed for a steady state balance between the calculated boreal forest GPP and the missing global carbon sink is found to be around 5.6 mol C m(-2) yr(-1).

AB Wetlands are one of the largest carbon sinks in the world due to their large carbon storage, potential for carbon sequestration in peat formation, sediment deposition and plant biomass. However, rapid economic development is causing changes to wetland carbon storage. China has participated in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and is decreasing its carbon emissions. Analyzing the carbon changes that are caused by wetland dynamics may provide some insights regarding decreasing carbon emissions. Therefore, wetland data from 1985, 1995 and 2005 were extracted from remote sensing images. Using spatial analysis and statistics, we determined that the water body area continued to increase, whereas the swamp, floodplain and shallow areas tended to decrease during the period from 1985 to 2005. Those changes caused wetland carbon stock to decrease. The conversion of other land use categories to wetland was the primary cause of carbon stock loss. Therefore, it is more beneficial for China to decrease per capita carbon emissions by decreasing carbon emissions from the conversion of other land use categories to wetlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Northern peatlands represent one of the largest biospheric carbon (C) reservoirs; however, the role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle remains intensely debated, owing in part to the paucity of detailed regional datasets and the complexity of the role of climate, ecosystem processes, and environmental factors in controlling peatland C dynamics. Here we used detailed C accumulation data from four peatlands and a compilation of peatland initiation ages across Alaska to examine Holocene peatland dynamics and climate sensitivity. We find that 75% of dated peatlands in Alaska initiated before 8,600 years ago and that early Holocene C accumulation rates were four times higher than the rest of the Holocene. Similar rapid peatland expansion occurred in West Siberia during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM). Our results suggest that high summer temperature and strong seasonality during the HTM in Alaska might have played a major role in causing the highest rates of C accumulation and peatland expansion. The rapid peatland expansion and C accumulation in these vast regions contributed significantly to the peak of atmospheric methane concentrations in the early Holocene. Furthermore, we find that Alaskan peatlands began expanding much earlier than peatlands in other regions, indicating an important contribution of these peatlands to the pre-Holocene increase in atmospheric methane concentrations.

AB The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) and water table draw-down on soil carbon sequestration in an ombrotrophic bog ecosystem were examined. Peat monoliths (11 cm diameter, 25 cm deep) with intact bog vegetation were exposed to ambient or elevated (ambient + 200 mg l(-1)) atmospheric CO2, combined with a natural water table (level with the peat surface) or a water table draw-down (-5 cm). Eight observations per treatment were included in the study, which was conducted over a 12 week period. Concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phenolic compounds and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were measured. The eCO(2) treatment caused an increase in the CH4 and CO2 fluxes and a small decrease in both the DOC and phenolic concentrations. The water table draw-down invoked decreases in phenolic and DOC concentrations, a decrease in CH4 flux and a small increase in CO2 flux. The combined (eCO(2) + water table draw-down) treatment caused a larger than expected CH4 flux decrease and CO2 flux increase and an increase in DOC concentration. Our results suggest very different effects on the system dependent on the treatment applied. The draw-down treatment principally increased oxidation of the rhizosphere resulting in increased decomposition and as such a removal of material from the dissolved carbon pool. The data also suggest labile carbon availability may be limiting the rate of decomposition and so slowing inorganic nutrient and carbon pool turn-over. The elevated CO2 addressed the labile-carbon limitation. Under the environment of the combined treatment, these limitations were effectively removed, culminating in a destabilisation of the carbon-sequestering environment to a weaker sink (or even a source) of atmospheric carbon.

AB Temperature sensitivities of microbial respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production were investigated by using a novel method, thermal gradient (2-20A degrees C) temperature bar, in two typical peatlands (bog and fen) in North Wales, UK over 12 months. The study indicated that temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon decomposition in North peatlands was regulated not only by temperature but soil water content, dry-rewet event and phenologies. Potential decreases of Q(10) (CO2) with increasing soil temperature were confirmed in both peatlands, but Q(10) (DOC) increase with increasing soil temperature in both bog and fen sites. These results imply, if other factors such as the so-called CO2 fertilization effect are simultaneously taken into account, that the feedback of global warming induced CO2 release from peatlands to climate change may be overestimated in current biogeochemical models. However, global warming might have been nonlinearly accelerating DOC thermal production, and therefore it helps explaining the causes of remarkable increase of DOC in surface water in the Northern Hemisphere during last several decades.

AB Microorganisms play critical roles in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. However, our understanding of the distribution of C- and N-cycling microbial communities along the permafrost peatland profile was limited. We characterized changes in the abundances of bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, methanotroph, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria along a soil profile in the permafrost peatland of the Great Hing'an Mountains, China. Maximum values of bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanotroph, and nirK-type denitrifying bacteria abundances were found for the 0-40 cm layer and minimum values for the 100-150 cm layer. Bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanotroph, and nirK-type denitrifying bacteria gradually decreased in terms of abundance with increasing soil depths. Methanogen, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria all showed the highest abundances in the 40-80 cm layer. Abundances of bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, methanotroph, and nirK-type denitrifying bacteria were all significantly negatively correlated with pH and C:N values, but significantly positively correlated with TC, TN, and TP levels. In the context of climate change, microbial distribution characteristics in the active, transition, and frozen layers in permafrost peatlands will change, and then affect C and N cycles. Results in this study highlighted the importance of sampling deeper soil depths in the study of microbial distribution and C/N cycles in peatland ecosystems.

AB A small body of research suggests that dissimilatory sulfate reduction can affect the carbon balance of peatlands, yet this has not been tested widely, despite the fact that peatlands contain approximately one-third of the global soil carbon pool. Here we evaluate the role of dissimilatory sulfate reduction in a site that receives low atmospheric sulfur deposition. We hypothesized that, in peatlands receiving low sulfate inputs, methane production should dominate anaerobic carbon mineralization. We further hypothesized that with sulfate amendments, anaerobic carbon mineralization could show an overall increase if terminal carbon mineralization in unamended peat is limited by an inadequate supply of electron acceptors. To test these hypotheses, we delineated six 1-m(2) plots in an ombrotrophic, boreal peatland in central Alberta, Canada (Bleak Lake Bog), which receives <2 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1). Three of the plots were amended with sulfate (78 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1)). We measured anaerobic rates of sulfate reduction, CH4 production, and CO2 production. In opposition to our hypotheses, sulfate amendments did not increase rates of sulfate reduction, increase CO2 production, or decrease CH4 production over a 2-yr period, but did increase both sulfate pool sizes and residence times. Despite low rates of sulfate reduction compared to other freshwater wetlands, daily average sulfate reduction (1.7 mmol/m(2)) exceeded regional annual inputs of atmospheric sulfate deposition (1.6 mmol/m(2)). Between 77% and 99% of reduced sulfate was incorporated into the carbon-bonded sulfur pool, which turns over slowly. The slow turnover rate and comparatively low sulfate reduction rates may be related to the low iron content of the bog peat. Additionally, sulfate reduction initially was sulfate limited in the control plots, but with sulfur amendments, the sulfate limitation was removed; sulfate reduction appeared to be limited by some other factor, possibly labile carbon. Dissimilatory sulfate reduction was more important to total anaerobic carbon mineralization than methane production, although neither process dominated overall anaerobic carbon mineralization (<2% of total). Fermentation appeared to be the dominant anaerobic carbon mineralization pathway at Bleak Lake Bog, yet the mechanisms of how this process affects the carbon balance of peatlands has never been evaluated. Overall, our results suggest that, in at least the short term, soil carbon turnover in peatlands will not be enhanced by increased atmospheric sulfur deposition. If we want to understand the controlling factors on soil carbon storage in sites like Bleak Lake Bog, we should begin to examine anaerobic carbon mineralization via fermentation pathways.

AB The existence of a feedback between climate and methane (CH4) emissions from wetlands has previously been hypothesized, but both its sign and amplitude remain unknown. Moreover, this feedback could interact with the climate-CO2 cycle feedback, which has not yet been accounted for at the global scale. These interactions relate to (i) the effect of atmospheric CO2 on methanogenic substrates by virtue of its fertilizing effect on plant productivity and (ii) the fact that a climate perturbation due to CO2 (respectively CH4) radiative forcing has an effect on wetland CH4 emissions (respectively CO2 fluxes at the surface/atmosphere interface).
   We present a theoretical analysis of these interactions, which makes it possible to express the magnitude of the feedback for CO2 and CH4 alone, the additional gain due to interactions between these two feedbacks and the effects of these feedbacks on the difference in atmospheric CH4 and CO2 between 2100 and pre-industrial time (respectively 1 CH4 and 1 CO2). These gains are expressed as functions of different sensitivity terms, which we estimate based on prior studies and from experiments performed with the global terrestrial vegetation model ORCHIDEE.
   Despite high uncertainties on the sensitivity of wetland CH4 emissions to climate, we found that the absolute value of the gain of the climate-CH4 feedback from wetlands is relatively low (<30% of climate-CO2 feedback gain), with either negative or positive sign within the range of estimates. Whereas the interactions between the two feedbacks have low influence on 1 CO2, the 1 CH4 could increase by 475 to 1400 ppb based on the sign of the C-CH4 feedback gain.
   Our study suggests that it is necessary to better constrain the evolution of wetland area under future climate change as well as the local coupling through methanogenesis substrate of the carbon and CH4 cycles - in particular the magnitude of the CO2 fertilization effect on the wetland CH4 emissions - as these are the dominant sources of uncertainty in our model.

TI Emissions from thaw ponds largely offset the carbon sink of northern
   permafrost wetlands
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAKES; MIRES; GASES; CH4; CO2
AB Northern regions have received considerable attention not only because the effects of climate change are amplified at high latitudes but also because this region holds vast amounts of carbon (C) stored in permafrost. These carbon stocks are vulnerable to warming temperatures and increased permafrost thaw and the breakdown and release of soil C in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The majority of research has focused on quantifying and upscaling the effects of thaw on CO2 and CH4 emissions from terrestrial systems. However, small ponds formed in permafrost wetlands following thawing have been recognized as hotspots for C emissions. Here, we examined the importance of small ponds for C fluxes in two permafrost wetland ecosystems in northern Sweden. Detailed flux estimates of thaw ponds during the growing season show that ponds emit, on average (+/- SD), 279 +/- 415 and 7 +/- 11 mmol C m(-2) d(-2) of CO2 and CH4, respectively. Importantly, addition of pond emissions to the total C budget of the wetland decreases the C sink by -39%. Our results emphasize the need for integrated research linking C cycling on land and in water in order to make correct assessments of contemporary C balances.

AB The early anthropogenic hypothesis claims that millennia ago farming began to transform landscapes sufficiently to emit greenhouse gases and extend the natural warmth of the current interglaciation that had been initiated by orbital variations. Part of the debate over the hypothesis during the last dozen years has centered on determining the best orbital analog to the Holocene among prior interglaciations, all of which must have been natural (non-anthropogenic) in origin. Since 2009, dozens of papers have assembled physical geographic evidence that points to the kind of large early agricultural impacts posed by the early anthropogenic hypothesis. These new findings include: pollen and archaeological evidence of carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting early forest clearance in Europe and China, along with archaeobotanical and archaeological evidence of methane (CH4)-emitting rice irrigation and livestock tending across southern Asia. In addition, mapping of C-14-dated peat deposits has revealed an important CO2 sink of C-12-enriched terrestrial carbon during the last 7000 years that countered the delta(CO2)-C-13 imprint of emissions from early deforestation. This viewpoint article provides a current perspective on this ongoing debate in the context of these recent findings. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands are productive ecosystems that play an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle and thus global carbon budgets. Climate variability affects amount of material entering and the metabolic balance of wetlands, thereby modifying carbon dynamics. This study presents spatiotemporal changes in air-water CO2 exchange in the vast wetlands of Donana (Spain) in relation to different hydrological cycles. Water sources feeding Donana, including groundwater and streams, ultimately depend on the fluctuating balance between annual precipitation and evapotranspiration. Hence, in order to examine the contribution of the rainfall pattern to the emission/capture of CO2 by a range of aquatic habitats in Donana, we took monthly measurements during severely wet, dry, and normal hydrological years (2010-2013). During wet hydrological cycles, CO2 outgassing from flooded marshes markedly decreased in comparison to that observed during subsequent dry-normal cycles, with mean values of 25.8419 and 5.28mmolm(-2)d(-1), respectively. Under drier meteorological conditions, air-water CO2 fluxes also diminished in permanent floodplains and ponds, which even behaved as mild sinks for atmospheric CO2 during certain periods. Increased inputs of dissolved CO2 from the underground aquifer and the stream following periods of high rainfall are believed to be behind this pattern. Large lagoons with a managed water supply from an adjacent estuary took up atmospheric CO2 nearly permanently. Regional air-water carbon transport was 15.2GgCyr(-1) under wet and 1.24GgCyr(-1) under dry meteorological conditions, well below the estimated net primary production for Donana wetlands, indicating that the ecosystem acts as a large CO2 sink.
   Plain Language Summary Wetlands are productive ecosystems that play a significant role in the Earth's carbon cycle, representing important contributors to the global carbon budget. Climate variability affects productivity in wetlands, thereby modifying their capacity to act as sink or source for atmospheric CO2. This study addresses how the hydrological cycle influences the capacity for carbon sequestration in the Mediterranean wetlands of Donana. Covering a surface of 3560km(2), Donana region includes a rich variety of landforms and vegetation types representative of Mediterranean lowlands. Its wetlands are one of the most emblematic protected areas in Europe with a high biotic diversity and unique importance for aquatic wildfowl. The region experiences annual cycles of flooding (October to March) and desiccation (May to June), with the inundation cycles being dependent on rainfall. Our measurements suggest that drier meteorological conditions result in lower CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from flooded marshes and permanent ponds whereas large lagoons with man-managed water supply from an adjacent estuary behave as carbon sequestrators. Predictions indicate an increasing frequency of droughts over the Mediterranean region due to climate change. These results highlight the importance of water management in Donana for wetlands conservation and their role in the atmospheric CO2 exchange.

AB Despite the importance of organic soils, including peatlands, in the global carbon cycle, detailed information on regional and global emissions is scarce. This is due to the difficulty to map, measure, and assess the complex dynamics of land, soil, and water interactions needed to assess the human-driven degradation of organic soils. We produced a new methodology for the comprehensive assessment of drained organic soils in agriculture and the estimation of the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Results indicated that over 25 million hectares of organic soils were drained worldwide for agriculture use, of which about 60% were in boreal and temperate cool areas, 34% in tropical areas, and 5% in warm temperate areas. Total emissions from the drainage were globally significant, totaling nearly one billion tonnes CO(2)eq annually. Of this, the CO2 component, about 780 million tonnes, represented more than one-fourth of total net CO2 emissions from agriculture, forestry, and land use. The bulk of these emissions came from a few tropical countries in Southeast Asia, and was linked to land clearing and drainage for crop cultivation. Geospatial data relative to this work were disseminated via the FAO geospatial server GeoNetwork, while the national aggregated statistics were disseminated via the FAOSTAT database.

AB Model-based estimates suggest that lake sediments may be a significant, long-term sink for organic carbon (C) at regional to global scales. These models have used various approaches to predict sediment storage at broad scales from very limited data sets. Here, we report a large-scale direct assessment of the standing stock and sedimentation rate of C for a representative set of lakes in Finland. The 122 lakes were selected from the statistically selected Nordic Lake Survey database, they cover the entire country and the water quality represents the average lake water quality in Finland. Unlike all prior estimates, these data use sediment cores that comprise the entire sediment record. The data show that within Finland, aquatic ecosystems contain the second largest areal C stocks (19 kg C m(-2)) after peatlands (72 kg C m(-2)), and exceed by significant amounts stocks in the forest soil (uppermost 75cm; 7.2 kg C m(-2)) and woody biomass (3.4 kg C m(-2)). Kauppi et al. (1997). The Finnish estimate extrapolated over the boreal region gives a total C pool in lakes 19-27 Pg C, significantly lower than the previous model-based estimates.

AB Ombrotrophic peatlands are a recognized global carbon reservoir. Without restoration and peat regrowth, harvested peatlands are dramatically altered, impairing their carbon sink function, with consequences for methane turnover. Previous studies determined the impact of commercial mining on the physicochemical properties of peat and the effects on methane turnover. However, the response of the underlying microbial communities catalyzing methane production and oxidation have so far received little attention. We hypothesize that with the return of Sphagnum spp. postharvest, methane turnover potential and the corresponding microbial communities will converge in a natural and restored peatland. To address our hypothesis, we determined the potential methane production and oxidation rates in natural (as a reference), actively mined, abandoned, and restored peatlands over two consecutive years. In all sites, the methanogenic and methanotrophic population sizes were enumerated using quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeting the mcrA and pmoA genes, respectively. Shifts in the community composition were determined using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the mcrA gene and a pmoA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP) analysis, complemented by cloning and sequence analysis of the mmoX gene. Peat mining adversely affected methane turnover potential, but the rates recovered in the restored site. The recovery in potential activity was reflected in the methanogenic and methanotrophic abundances. However, the microbial community composition was altered, being more pronounced for the methanotrophs. Overall, we observed a lag between the recovery of the methanogenic/methanotrophic activity and the return of the corresponding microbial communities, suggesting that a longer duration (>15 years) is needed to reverse mining-induced effects on the methane-cycling microbial communities.
   IMPORTANCE Ombrotrophic peatlands are a crucial carbon sink, but this environment is also a source of methane, an important greenhouse gas. Methane emission in peatlands is regulated by methane production and oxidation catalyzed by methanogens and methanotrophs, respectively. Methane-cycling microbial communities have been documented in natural peatlands. However, less is known of their response to peat mining and of the recovery of the community after restoration. Mining exerts an adverse impact on potential methane production and oxidation rates and on methanogenic and methanotrophic population abundances. Peat mining also induced a shift in the methane-cycling microbial community composition. Nevertheless, with the return of Sphagnum spp. in the restored site after 15 years, methanogenic and methanotrophic activity and population abundance recovered well. The recovery, however, was not fully reflected in the community composition, suggesting that >15 years are needed to reverse mining-induced effects.

The best growth rate and cell count were obtained with peat containing 40% moisture (wet basis) and a volume fraction of moist peat of 0.3 in the roller bottle bioreactors. A cell count of 1.3 to 1.9 x 10(9) CFU/g was achieved in 4 d or less, from an initial inoculum of 10(6) CFU/g. in a rotating drum bioreactor, the growth of R. leguminosarum on peat with sucrose as the main carbon source was completed after 4 d. The majority of growth was in the first 2 d, based on carbon dioxide evolution. These results showed that growth of R. leguminosarum was more rapid in the rotating drum than in bags of peat, due to enhanced oxygen transfer.

TI Warmer temperature accelerates methane emissions from the Zoige wetland

AB Zoige wetland, locating on the Tibet Plateau, accounts for 6.2% of organic carbon storage in China. However, the fate of the organic carbon storage in the Zoige wetland remains poorly understood despite the Tibetan Plateau is very sensitive to global climate change. As methane is an important greenhouse gas and methanogenesis is the terminal step in the decomposition of organic matter, understanding how methane emissions from the Zoige wetland is fundamental to elucidate the carbon cycle in alpine wetlands responding to global warming. In this study, microcosms were performed to investigate the effects of temperature and vegetation on methane emissions and microbial processes in the Zoige wetland soil. A positive correlation was observed between temperature and methane emissions. However, temperature had no effect on the main methanogenic pathway-acetotrophic methanogenesis. Moreover, methanogenic community composition was not related to temperature, but was associated with vegetation, which was also involved in methane emissions. Taken together, these results indicate temperature increases methane emissions in alpine wetlands, while vegetation contributes significantly to methanogenic community composition and is associated with methane emissions. These findings suggest that in alpine wetlands temperature and vegetation act together to affect methane emissions, which furthers a global warming feedback loop.

AB Climate warming and human impacts are thought to be causing peatlands to dry, potentially converting them from sinks to sources of carbon. However, it is unclear whether the hydrological status of peatlands has moved beyond their natural envelope. Here we show that European peatlands have undergone substantial, widespread drying during the last similar to 300 years. We analyse testate amoeba-derived hydrological reconstructions from 31 peatlands across Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia and Continental Europe to examine changes in peatland surface wetness during the last 2,000 years. We find that 60% of our study sites were drier during the period 1800-2000 (CE) than they have been for the last 600 years, 40% of sites were drier than they have been for 1,000 years and 24% of sites were drier than they have been for 2,000 years. This marked recent transition in the hydrology of European peatlands is concurrent with compound pressures including climatic drying, warming and direct human impacts on peatlands, although these factors vary among regions and individual sites. Our results suggest that the wetness of many European peatlands may now be moving away from natural baselines. Our findings highlight the need for effective management and restoration of European peatlands.

SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE cut-away peatlands; Estonia; Finland; forest drainage; mires;
   monitoring; Sweden
AB Environmental management of peatlands, landscape ecology and protection of key biotopes have created needs and pressure to restore drained peatlands to natural mire ecosystems. Here, we summarize different approaches and restoration techniques developed for peatland management in Estonia, Sweden, and Finland where peatlands are abundant. Without rewetting, plant colonisation on abandoned cut-away areas is slow due to harsh hydrological and microclimatic conditions. However, after restoration, cut-away peatlands may return to a functional state close to that of pristine mires, and therefore restore a net carbon sink function within a few years. In addition, restoration techniques can help to create buffer zones between terrestrial and limnic ecosystems that reduces the nutrient loading imposed on watercourses by forestry operations. Restoration may also be important for peatland conservation programs as drained peatlands are part of present and future conservation areas. Finally, restoration actions in themselves can have negative environmental impacts. For instance, inundation of peat surfaces resulting from the rewetting process often increases phosphorus leaching. Efforts on peatland restoration should focus on environmental monitoring, research on restoration and its environmental impact as well as public relations activities. In that respect, knowledge transfer between academics and managers should generate synergy benefits.

AB Natural organic matter poses an increasing challenge to water managers because of its potential adverse impacts on water treatment and distribution, and subsequently human health. Projections were made of impacts of climate change on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the primarily agricultural Boyne catchment which is used as a potable water supply in Ireland. The results indicated that excluding a potential rise in extreme precipitation, future projected loads are not dissimilar to those observed under current conditions This is because projected increases in DOC concentrations are offset by corresponding decreases in precipitation and hence river flow. However, the results presented assume no changes in land use and highlight the predicted increase in DOC loads from abstracted waters at water treatment plants. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Peatland ecosystems store about 500-600 Pg of organic carbon, largely accumulated since the last glaciation. Whether they continue to sequester carbon or release it as greenhouse gases, perhaps in large amounts, is important in Earth's temperature dynamics. Given both ages and depths of numerous dated sample peatlands, their rate of carbon sequestration can be estimated throughout the Holocene. Here we use average values for carbon content per unit volume, the geographical extent of peatlands, and ecological models of peatland establishment and growth, to reconstruct the time-trajectory of peatland carbon sequestration in North America and project it into the future. Peatlands there contain similar to 163 Pg of carbon. Ignoring effects of climate change and other major anthropogenic disturbances, the rate of carbon accumulation is projected to decline slowly over millennia as reduced net carbon accumulation in existing peatlands is largely balanced by new peatland establishment. Peatland; are one of few long-term terrestrial carbon sinks, probably important for global carbon regulation in future generations. This study contributes to a better understanding of these ecosystems that will assist their inclusion in earth-system models, and therefore their management to maintain carbon storage during climate change.

AB Response surface methodology was used to develop a fermentation medium for the enhanced biosynthesis of a novel sulfide oxidase by Arthrobacter species strain FR-3. The interactive effect of the medium components - such as glucose as the carbon source, and tryptone and yeast extract as the nitrogen source - was evaluated by a 2'-factorial central composite statistical design. Glucose and yeast extract were to be the more influential medium constituents compared to tryptone since they had lower coefficients of linear effect, P-values (< 0.02). The optimal fermentation medium components for the enhanced production of sulfide oxidase were recorded as glucose (8.98 g/L), tryptone (10.62 g/L) and yeast extract (7.3 g/L). Optimization of the medium constituents increased the experimental enzyme yield by 54% compared to the unoptimized medium. This is the first report on the overproduction of sulfide oxidase by using response surface methodology.

AB Understanding of the surface energy balance is important for predicting climate change effects on carbon cycling in peatlands. Modelling of surface energy fluxes is complicated in these environments because of microscale surface topography, non-vascular moss dynamics, and sparse overstory vegetation; thus traditional 'big leaf' approaches do not simulate peatland environments well. Here we adapted a three-source (leaf, hummock, hollow) energy balance model and applied it to energy flux and temperature data from the Mer Bleue bog peatland. Model results show that latent heat flux partitioning into components from the three sources was strongly tied to available energy, The model output suggests that the vascular plants contributed 60-80% of the latent beat flux, hummocks 10-30%, and hollows 10%. These component contributions to latent heat flux showed little variation throughout the study period. It appears that this behaviour resulted from offsetting controls imposed by the vascular plant physiology and moss and peat porosity and capillarity characteristics. Although there was no evidence of strong microadvection between the vascular shrubs and hummock and hollow microtopography, this study highlights the importance of moss in the overall peatland energy fluxes.

AB Warming and water table drawdown greatly reshape peatland carbon cycle, especially when considering the old carbon stored under the peatland subsurface. However, little is known about the effects of warming, oxidizing by drying or their combination on carbon decomposition at different depths (0-100 cm) of peat. In this research, soil of different depths from Zoige Plateau was incubated in four scenarios (8 degrees C-anaerobic, 8 degrees C-aerobic, 18 degrees C-anaerobic and 18 degrees C-aerobic) to detect the exported carbon. Our result showed that soil respiration (Rs) increased obviously with enhanced temperature and oxygen. The total CO2 fluxes of 2400.22 +/- 57.69 mg m(-2) d(-1) under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition increased by 73.6%, 40.7% and 176.5% with warming, oxidizing and their combined effect, respectively. The average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was 74.90 +/- 8.09 mg kg(-1) under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition, but increased by 53.5%, 44% and 159.4%, respectively under the condition of warming, oxidizing and their combination. Rs and its variation underwarming and oxidization differed significantly among different depths, probably caused by the differences of soil substrate, especially the variation in distribution of soil microbes and enzymes among depths of peatlands. By classifying the source of Rs as young soil (YS: 0-20 cm) and old soil (OS: 21-100 cm), this reseaerch found that OS accounted for a huge part of total Rs under 8 degrees C-anaerobic condition (CO2: 74.2%; DOC: 60.7%). Such relative contribution of OS to total Rs did not change obviously with warming or oxidizing. Though YS and OS responded equally to warming and oxidizing, OS was responsible for a larger proportion of total increase in Rs. Compared with other studies, we concluded that peatlands soil in our field of mid-latitude and high altitude is less sensitive to warming and oxidizing than peatlands of higher latitude, but that OS of this peatlands is more critical in predicting regional carbon cycle.

AB Preservation of organic matter (OM) in the geosphere has a direct impact on carbon bioavailability, the carbon cycle and the formation of fossil fuels. We have examined some of the processes that lead to the preservation of OM by characterising insoluble OM in a Sphagnum peat bog. We focussed on the partitioning of prokaryotic biomarkers between solvent-extractable and insoluble OM fractions and how that partitioning changed with depth. The insoluble organic matter (IOM) was examined using stepwise chemical degradation involving base and acid hydrolysis. Iso-and anteiso-C-15 and C-17 fatty acids (FAs), hopanoic acid and bishomohopanol, and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) diagnostic for Bacteria - were targeted as well as archaeol and isoprenoidal GDGTs - diagnostic for Archaea. High percentages of these compounds - up to 65% - occur in IOM pools, indicating that archaeal-and bacterially derived OM is prone to insolubilization even in shallow sediments (< 5 cm depth). Differences in functionalities - likely related to intact polar (IP) head groups - seem to determine the insolubilization of prokaryotic lipids; specifically, we propose that compounds bearing rapidly degradable phosphate-based polar head groups are less likely to be incorporated into the insoluble OM pools. Collectively, these data indicate that microbial membrane lipids are rapidly incorporated into peat IOM during early diagenesis. We suggest that this is due to an inherently recalcitrant character of some prokaryotic cells which affords protection to their membrane lipids. However, this large proportion of insoluble prokaryotic lipids does not appear to be entirely stable at shallow burial depths, indicating that the peat IOM is a dynamic reservoir, at least during early diagenesis.

AB Peatlands cover 3% of the land, occur in 169 countries, and have-by sequestering 600 Gt of carbon-cooled the global climate by 0.6 degrees C. After a general review about peatlands worldwide, this paper describes the importance of the Great Vasyugan Mire and presents suggestions about its protection and future research. The World's largest peatland, the Great Vasyugan Mire in West-Siberia, forms the border between the Taiga and the Forest-Steppe biomes and harbours rare species and mire types and globally unique self-organizing patterns. Current oil and gas exploitation may arguably be largely phased out by 2050, which will pave the way for a stronger focus on the mire's role in buffering climate change, maintaining ecosystem diversity, and providing other ecosystem services. Relevant new research lines will benefit from the extensive data sets that earlier studies have gathered for other purposes. Its globally unique character as the 'largest life form on land' qualifies the Great Vasyugan Mire in its entirety to be designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance.

AB Vast areas of peatlands have been drained for forestry endangering their carbon sink function. Peatland rewetting aims at mitigating the situation through restoring the hydrology and vegetation of these areas. We compared the carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and phytomass on four pairs of rewetted and pristine peatland sites in Finland and Estonia, and described correlations between phytomass and CO2 fluxes. We measured the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), respiration and photosynthesis over one growing season using manual chambers, and biomass of plant functional types (PFT) on rewetted sites and their pristine counterparts. Although pair-wise differences in the vegetation were small, pristine sites were on average stronger CO2 sinks than rewetted sites. Respiration was higher in hummocks while no differences were found in photosynthesis between hummocks and hollows. No clear relationship between the biomasses of PFTs and NEE was found. Generally, however, CO2 uptake decreased with increase in Sphagnum biomass.

AB To quantify potential nitrogen (N) deposition impacts on peatland carbon (C) uptake, we explored temporal and spatial trends in N deposition and climate impacts on the production of the key peat forming functional group (Sphagnum mosses) across European peatlands for the period 1900-2050. Using a modelling approach we estimated that between 1900 and 1950 N deposition impacts remained limited irrespective of geographical position. Between 1950 and 2000 N deposition depressed production between 0 and 25% relative to 1900, particularly in temperate regions. Future scenarios indicate this trend will continue and become more pronounced with climate warming. At the European scale, the consequences for Sphagnum net C-uptake remained small relative to 1900 due to the low peatland cover in high-N areas. The predicted impacts of likely changes in N deposition on Sphagnum productivity appeared to be less than those of climate. Nevertheless, current critical loads for peatlands are likely to hold under a future climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study uses detailed monitoring of a peat catchment to estimate the amount of DOC loss within a stream. The study compares DOC concentrations and specific absorbances (absorbance at 400 nm per concentration of DOC) of shallow and deep soil waters with those at the catchment Outlet. The mass balance between source and outlet is assessed by two methods: a simple method based upon a conservative tracer, and one based upon a principal component analysis using multiple tracers. The single tracer method suggests an average removal of 20% while the principal component approach suggests 32% removal. The rate of removal varies between 0.03 and 23 mg C/day. On an annual basis the removal amounts to between 45.8 and 85 ton C/year, equivalent to an areal loss of between 4 and 7.4 g C/m(2)/year. The change in specific absorbance, at 400 nm, shows that the DOC is sourced from shallow soil water (10 cm) and not from the deep soil water (50 cm). There is consistent increase in specific absorbance through the catchment. The rate of removal is zero-order with respect to DOC concentration but shows significant decrease with increasing specific absorbance and stream residence time. The study shows that by accounting for the loss of DOC within the streams of the catchment, the catchment is close to balance with respect to carbon and is a smaller carbon sink than previously estimated.

AB Of all terrestrial ecosystems, peatlands store carbon most effectively in long-term scales of millennia. However, many peatlands have been drained for peat extraction or agricultural use. This converts peatlands from sinks to sources of carbon, causing approx. 5% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect and additional negative effects on other ecosystem services. Rewetting peatlands can mitigate climate change and may be combined with management in the form of paludiculture. Rewetted peatlands, however, do not equal their pristine ancestors and their ecological functioning is not understood. This holds true especially for groundwater-fed fens. Their functioning results from manifold interactions and can only be understood following an integrative approach of many relevant fields of science, which we merge in the interdisciplinary project WETSCAPES. Here, we address interactions among water transport and chemistry, primary production, peat formation, matter transformation and transport, microbial community, and greenhouse gas exchange using state of the art methods. We record data on six study sites spread across three common fen types (Alder forest, percolation fen, and coastal fen), each in drained and rewetted states. First results revealed that indicators reflecting more long-term effects like vegetation and soil chemistry showed a stronger differentiation between drained and rewetted states than variables with a more immediate reaction to environmental change, like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Variations in microbial community composition explained differences in soil chemical data as well as vegetation composition and GHG exchange. We show the importance of developing an integrative understanding of managed fen peatlands and their ecosystem functioning.

AB Coastal marine vegetation has been recently highlighted for its highly efficient carbon storage capacity. Among the sixty-four species of seagrass, Posidonia oceanica, a Mediterranean endemic species, appears to be the most effective in carbon fixation and storage. Based on new data from the study of one of the largest P. oceanica meadows in the Mediterranean Sea (100 km of coastline, 20 425 ha), and a synthesis of available data from the whole of the Mediterranean basin, the aim of this work is to evaluate the amount of carbon fixed each year by P. oceanica and sequestered in the matte, in relation with the mitigation of the impact of climate change (carbon sink). The mean total carbon fixation (blades, sheaths and rhizomes) per year varies between 33.5 and 426.6 g C.m(-2) and the mean carbon sequestration (long-term sink in the matte), corresponding to the sheath and rhizome tissues, varies between 7.7 and 84.4 g C.m(-2), with a clear decreasing trend according to depth because of the meadow density decrease. The synthesis of a hundred measurements made throughout the Mediterranean Sea and at depths between 0.5 and 32.0 m provides a basis for estimating the average annual carbon fixation and sequestration rate throughout the Mediterranean basin. The fixation of the blades is estimated at 1 024 t C.ha(-1).yr(- 1), that of the sheaths at 220 t C ha(-1).yr(-1) and that of the rhizomes at 58 t C ha(-1).yr(-1); i.e. a total fixation rate of 1 302 t C ha(-1).yr(-1) and sequestration rate (dead sheaths and rhizomes) of 278 t C ha(-1).yr(-1). This annual carbon fixation represents only 0.61% on average of CO2 emissions/releases for all Mediterranean countries but in the large Mediterranean islands this fixation is on average 3.1% and can reach almost 14.4% for Corsica. Moreover, the major advantage of the P. oceanica meadow lies in its capacity to store carbon from annual carbon sequestration for centuries to millennia and can be compared to several terrestrial ecosystems considered to be efficient in carbon storage (peatlands).

AB We estimated the global warming potential of Estonian peatlands (transitional fens and ombrotrophic bogs) based on greenhouse gases (GHG) CO2, CH4, and N2O and carbon (C) accrual in biomass, and the effects of drainage on these processes. Data were derived from a review of the literature of boreal peatlands. Areal estimates of peatland types were Multiplied with the values of the interquartile range of literature-derived GHG fluxes. The effect of drainage and radiative forcing of Estonian peatlands were also evaluated. Annual emission Of CO2, CH4, and N2O is estimated to be 278 to 1,056 x 10(3) Of CO2 equivalent (eq), of which CO2 makes up 22 to 44%, CH4 53 to 73%, and N2O 3 to 5%. The annual efflux is 419 to 676 x 10(3) CO2 eq year(-1) from drained peatlands, and - 141 to 380 x 10(3) CO2 eq year(-1) from the undrained peatlands. The annual loss of C from peatlands is estimated to be 38 to 86 tons C x 10(3) year(-1). Thus due to drainage, Estonia's transitional fens and ombrotrophic bogs have gone from being sinks to sources of C.

AB Studying boreal-type peatlands near the edge of their southern limit can provide insight into responses of boreal and sub-arctic peatlands to warmer climates. In this study, we investigated peatland history using multi-proxy records of sediment composition, plant macrofossil, pollen, and diatom analysis from a C-14-dated sediment core at Tannersville Bog in northeastern Pennsylvania, USA. Our results indicate that peat accumulation began with lake infilling of a glacial lake at similar to 9 ka as a rich fen dominated by brown mosses. It changed to a poor fen dominated by Cyperaceae (sedges) and Sphagnum (peat mosses) at similar to 1.4 ka and to a Sphagnum-dominated poor fen at similar to 200 cal yr BP (similar to AD 1750). Apparent carbon accumulation rates increased from 13.4 to 101.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) during the last 8000 yr, with a time-averaged mean of 27.3 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). This relatively high accumulation rate, compared to many northern peatlands, was likely caused by high primary production associated with a warmer and wetter temperate climate. This study implies that some northern peatlands can continue to serve as carbon sinks under a warmer and wetter climate, providing a negative feedback to climate warming.

AB The analysis of pyrogenic carbon (PyC) in environmental samples is of great interest, e.g. for carbon cycle assessment, (bio-)char characterization and palaeo-environmental or archeological reconstruction. Here, an HPLC method (HPLC) is presented that reproducibly quantifies benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) as molecular markers for PyC in various kinds of environmental samples. It operates at low pH without requiring an organic modifier and was thoroughly tested with PyC reference materials and a peatland core that served as a feasibility and plausibility check. Compared to the established gas chromatography (GC) method, the HPLC method results in higher BPCA quantification reproducibility by showing a significantly smaller coefficient of variation (HPLC: 5%, GC: 16-23%). It works well with small sample amounts, as for instance from sediment cores and aerosol collectors, and requires less sample preparation work than the GC method. Moreover, the here presented HPLC method facilitates C-13 and C-14 analyses on PyC from environmental samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the biomass production of moss species typical of pine-dominated drained peatland forests to evaluate their potential role in the carbon cycle of such sites. The study was carried out at two sites in Lakkasuo, central Finland. Prior to drainage, the sites had been mesotrophic and ombrotrophic. Shoots of Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium, S. fuscum, S. magellanicum and S. russowii were marked in the autumn of 2004 and 2005, incorporated back in the original patches, recovered one year later, and measured for height growth, biomass, and biomass production. Biomass production varied from 16 to 388 g dry mass m(-2) yr(-1). Both height growth and biomass production were higher at the mesotrophic site, while biomass estimates did not show distinct difference between sites. Variation in production within each dominant species was considerable. A simulation with our production values and published estimates of decomposition rates showed that these species have the potential to contribute significantly to soil carbon storage in drained peatlands.

AB The effect of shallow water table fluctuations on the evaporation and CO2 fluxes in a peatland is investigated. The fluxes of evaporation and net ecosystem exchange of carbon were measured from mid-spring to the end of summer in 2005 and 2006 and simulated independently with process models. The observed and modelled data were then compared along a gradient of water levels. Any variation along the gradient would imply an influence of the water table on the flux. It became evident that changes in the water table had no effect on the evaporation and CO2 fluxes of the peatland. A probable cause could be the high water content of the soil, even for the low water tables, and the stable thermal conductivity of the soil. This study has implications for current land use management, which is aimed at reducing CO2-emissions. Regulations are currently concerned with water table while this study shows that soil water content should be focused on as well. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies have shown that the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) was preceded by a series of short-lived global warming events, known as hyperthermals. Here we present high-resolution benthic stable carbon and oxygen isotope records from ODP Sites 1262 and 1263 (Walvis Ridge, SE Atlantic) between similar to 54 and similar to 52 million years ago, tightly constraining the character, timing, and magnitude of six prominent hyperthermal events. These events, which include Eocene Thermal Maximum (ETM) 2 and 3, are studied in relation to orbital forcing and long-term trends. Our findings reveal an almost linear relationship between delta C-13 and delta O-18 for all these hyperthermals, indicating that the eccentricity-paced covariance between deep-sea temperature changes and extreme perturbations in the exogenic carbon pool persisted during these events towards the onset of the EECO, in accordance with previous observations for the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) and ETM2. The covariance of delta C-13 and delta O-18 during H2 and I2, which are the second pulses of the "paired" hyperthermal events ETM2-H2 and I1-I2, deviates with respect to the other events. We hypothesize that this could relate to a relatively higher contribution of an isotopically heavier source of carbon, such as peat or permafrost, and/or to climate feedbacks/local changes in circulation. Finally, the delta O-18 records of the two sites show a systematic offset with on average 0.2 parts per thousand heavier values for the shallower Site 1263, which we link to a slightly heavier isotopic composition of the intermediate water mass reaching the northeastern flank of the Walvis Ridge compared to that of the deeper northwestern water mass at Site 1262.

AB PALADYN is presented; it is a new comprehensive and computationally efficient land surface-vegetation-carbon cycle model designed to be used in Earth system models of intermediate complexity for long-term simulations and paleoclimate studies.
   The model treats in a consistent manner the interaction between atmosphere, terrestrial vegetation and soil through the fluxes of energy, water and carbon. Energy, water and carbon are conserved. PALADYN explicitly treats permafrost, both in physical processes and as an important carbon pool. It distinguishes nine surface types: five different vegetation types, bare soil, land ice, lake and ocean shelf. Including the ocean shelf allows the treatment of continuous changes in sea level and shelf area associated with glacial cycles. Over each surface type, the model solves the surface energy balance and computes the fluxes of sensible, latent and ground heat and upward shortwave and longwave radiation. The model includes a single snow layer.
   Vegetation and bare soil share a single soil column. The soil is vertically discretized into five layers where prognostic equations for temperature, water and carbon are consistently solved. Phase changes of water in the soil are explicitly considered. A surface hydrology module computes precipitation interception by vegetation, surface runoff and soil infiltration. The soil water equation is based on Darcy's law. Given soil water content, the wetland fraction is computed based on a topographic index. The temperature profile is also computed in the upper part of ice sheets and in the ocean shelf soil.
   Photosynthesis is computed using a light use efficiency model. Carbon assimilation by vegetation is coupled to the transpiration of water through stomatal conductance. PALADYN includes a dynamic vegetation module with five plant functional types competing for the grid cell share with their respective net primary productivity.
   PALADYN distinguishes between mineral soil carbon, peat carbon, buried carbon and shelf carbon. Each soil carbon type has its own soil carbon pools generally represented by a litter, a fast and a slow carbon pool in each soil layer. Carbon can be redistributed between the layers by vertical diffusion and advection. For the vegetated macro surface type, decomposition is a function of soil temperature and soil moisture. Carbon in permanently frozen layers is assigned a long turnover time which effectively locks carbon in permafrost. Carbon buried below ice sheets and on flooded ocean shelves is treated differently. The model also includes a dynamic peat module.
   PALADYN includes carbon isotopes C-13 and C-14, which are tracked through all carbon pools. Isotopic discrimination is modelled only during photosynthesis.
   A simple methane module is implemented to represent methane emissions from anaerobic carbon decomposition in wetlands (including peatlands) and flooded ocean shelf.
   The model description is accompanied by a thorough model evaluation in offline mode for the present day and the historical period.

AB Peatlands can be classified into fens and bogs based on their hydrology. Development of fens to bogs is accompanied by the invasion of Sphagnum species. The purpose of this study was to determine how the decomposition process in fens is influenced by the transition from a vascular plant-dominated system to a Sphagnum-dominated system. We carried out a reciprocal litter bag experiment, using litter of Carex diandra C. lasiocarpa, Sphagnum papillosum and S. squarrosum in a fen dominated by Sphagnum species and a fen without Spagnum. Decomposition rare and nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics of the plant Jitter were measured in a field experiment for two years. Decomposition rate was highest for the Carex litter types and lowest for the Sphagnum litter types. Surprisingly, decomposition rates hardly differed between the two sites. Nutrient dynamics, however, showed a clear site-effect: In the Sphagnum site net mineraIization was observed for all litter types whereas in the Carer site net immobilization was observed. These results show that carbon and nutrient cycles were coupled in a different way in a Sphagnum-dominated and a Carex-dominated site, respectively. Nutrient availability and adaptation of the microbial community to nutritional and other environmental conditions may be the main regulators of carbon and nutrient cycles in these peatlands.

AB Peatlands have an important global role as carbon sinks. Locally, however, peat bog extraction can cause pollution in nearby watercourses. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of multivariate methods in the renovation and protection of eutrophic lakes surrounded by agricultural and peat extraction areas. The analytical data used in the study originated from a national water quality database and the period studied was 2000-2013. Multivariate methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) were applied to solve interactions of variables and pollution sources in a complex water ecosystem. Leaching from the peat bog area was found to be the main source of iron, which has an important role as a precipitator of phosphorus in loose sediment and in water. Nutrient ratios had no direct correlation to algae blooms, but high ratios indicated an increased likelihood of an upcoming bloom.

AB Since the last deglaciation, 300-500 Pg carbon have accumulated in northern peatlands (346 mill. ha). While sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2), these peatlands release considerable amounts of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. The greenhouse-gas balance of peatlands may change in the future if summers become warmer and drier, as has been predicted for high latitudes. Subsequent emissions of CH4 would decrease, whereas emissions of CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) would increase. Water-level drawdown has been predicted to enhance the greenhouse impact from northern peatlands. The components of carbon cycling were measured both in undrained and drained peatlands of different trophic levels, The results were drawn together into a single radiative forcing factor, to assess the combined atmospheric effects of water-level drawdown. We present a hypothesis, based on the measured changes in carbon stores in soil and tree stand, and fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O after water-level drawdown caused by drainage for forestry. The hypothesis suggests that possible drying arising from climate change would, in fact, decrease the impact of northern peatlands on the total radiative forcing for about one hundred years by c. 0.1 W m(-2). This is caused by the decrease in CH4 emissions, fairly small changes in the peat carbon storage, and increase in the tree-stand biomass storage.

AB Palsa peatland soils are known as significant terrestrial storage of the Earth's soil carbon. The response of these soils to changing climate may result in a strong feedback to global carbon balance. In laboratory, we investigated the effect of rising temperatures on the upper (T1) and lower (T2) horizons of Turbic Histic Cryosols using sequential (S) and equal-time (ET) methods. The S method was applied to estimate the response of organic carbon mineralization rate (R) to sequential temperature increase from 5 to 30 degrees C; the ET method was used to study the response of the basal (microbial) respiration rate to equal-time incubation at 5, 15, and 25 degrees C. The Q(10) coefficient was calculated. In the T1 horizon, both methods (S and ET) demonstrated a positive response of respiration to the rise in temperature. The respiration intensity increased by 91 and 84%, respectively. In the T2 horizon, it increased by 93 and 91%, respectively. However, despite the overall positive response of soil respiration to the rise in temperature, the Q(10) values demonstrated differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. These values were maximal in the cold (5-15 degrees C) range for both horizons. For most of temperature ranges, Q(10) was higher for T2 than for T1. For the T1 horizon and S method, Q(10) slightly varied (2.7-3.0), whereas in the case of the ET method, it decreased by 3.3 times from the cold (4.9) to the warm 15-25 degrees C (1.5) temperature range. For the T2 horizon, the S method also did not cause significant shifts in Q(10) (3.0-3.5); the ET method caused a decrease in Q(10) by 1.5 times from the cold (4.3) to the warm (2.8) temperature range. To sum up, the ET method leads to a wider variation of Q(10) values in comparison with the S method thus indicating its better applicability for temperature sensitivity studies with palsa peatland soils under laboratory conditions.

AB Forestry drainage is the main management practice of peatlands in Finland. The influence of drainage and management on carbon (C) fluxes may vary, e.g., depending on the original peatland type. We have studied C fluxes in two forestry-drained peatlands with different nutrient status.
   Our hypothesis that the differences in the C balance between these two sites can be attributed to differences in soil respiration rates, and in particular to the priming effect, was tested with laboratory microcosm flux measurements and C-14 isotopic partitioning method. A two-pool mixing-model based on the natural difference in the respired (CO2)-C-14 between the peat and plants was employed.
   We found no statistically significant priming effect in either nutrient-poor or nutrient-rich soil, respectively.
   As no differences in priming effect were found, we can conclude that the nutrient status of the sites does not affect the priming effect in the peat soils studied here, thus our results suggest that organic soils do not support priming to the same extent as mineral soils.

AB 1The vertical and horizontal dynamics of peat carbon accumulation in Ruosuo aapa mire, north-central Finland, were investigated in an attempt to understand variations in carbon accumulation over time.
   2 Paludification began around 8700 BP (9600 cal BP). The long-term net carbon accumulation rate, based on vertical and lateral growth, was 8.0 g C m(-2) year(-1). Variations in carbon accumulation rates can be explained to a great extent by natural succession and variations in local conditions, but the role of climate cannot be ignored.
   3 The marked decline in carbon accumulation rates after 6100 BP (7000 cal BP) may indicate a relatively dry and warm climate. The levelling out and subsequent increase in carbon accumulation rates after 4000 BP (4500 cal BP) indicates the development of a cooler and moister climate.
   4 The low long-term net carbon accumulation rate and the high carbon content per unit volume in the layer underlying the surficial peat is typical for a wet aapa mire. The continuous penetration of roots, mostly sedge, results in carbon input into the underlying peat layer and contributes to the intensive decay of the surficial peat due to high biological activity.
   5 Although one-third of the apparent carbon has accumulated during the last 2000 years, most of Ruosuo is approaching the stage where primary production does not adequately compensate for overall carbon loss. The declining net carbon accumulation rates from the base up to the depth of 80 cm may indicate a real delayed trend in net carbon accumulation rates.
   6 We suggest that under the present climatic conditions the northern circumpolar wet mires are significant sources of greenhouse gases. In addition to high methane production, northern aapa mires also have lower carbon accumulation rates than more southern raised bogs.
   7 Our results, which are based on horizontal and vertical carbon accumulation rates, suggest that the earlier published carbon accumulation rates in Finnish aapa mires are overestimated.

AB Peatlands are carbon-accumulating wetland ecosystems, developed through an imbalance among organic matter production and decomposition processes. Soil saturation is the principal cause of anoxic conditions that constrain organic matter decay. Accordingly, changes in the hydrologic regime will affect the carbon (C) dynamics in forested peatlands. Our objective is to review ecological studies and experiments on managed peatlands that provide a basis for assessing the effects of an altered hydrology on C dynamics. We conclude that climate change influences will be mediated primarily through the hydrologic cycle. A lower water table resulting from altered precipitation patterns and increased atmospheric temperature may be expected to decrease soil CH4 and increase CO2 emissions from the peat surface. Correspondingly, the C balance in forested peatlands is also sensitive to management and restoration prescriptions. Increases in soil CO2 efflux do not necessarily equate with net losses from the soil C pool. While the fundamentals of the C balance in peatlands are well-established, the combined affects of global change stressors and management practices are best considered using process-based biogeochemical models. Long-term studies are needed both for validation and to provide a framework for longitudinal assessments of the peatland C cycle.

AB In peatlands the reduced decomposition rate of plant litter is the fundamental mechanism making these peat-accumulating ecosystems effective carbon sinks. A better knowledge of litter decomposition and nutrient cycling is thus crucial to improve our predictions of the effects of anthropogenic perturbation on the capacity of peatlands to continue to behave as carbon sinks. We investigated patterns of plant litter decomposition and nutrient release along a minerotrophic-ombrotrophic gradient in a bog on the south-eastern Alps of Italy. We determined mass loss as well as P, N, K, and C release of seven vascular plant species and four moss species after I year in both native and transplanted habitats. Hence, differences in litter decay were supposed to reflect the degree of adaptability of microbial communities to litter quality. Polyphenols/nutrient and C/nutrient quotients appeared as the main parameters accounting for decomposition rates of Sphagnum litter. In particular, litter of minerotrophic Sphagnum species decomposed always faster than litter of ombrotrophic Sphagnum species, both in native and transplanted habitats. Decomposition rates of vascular plant litter in native habitats were always higher than the corresponding mass loss rates of Sphagnum litter. Minerotrophic forbs showed the fastest decomposition both in native and transplanted habitats in accordance with low C/P and C/N litter quotients. On the other hand, C/P quotient seems to play a primary role also in controlling decomposition of graminoids. Decomposition of deciduous and evergreen shrubs was negatively related to their high lignin content. Nitrogen release from Sphagnum litter was primarily controlled by C/N quotient, so that minerotrophic Sphagnum litter released more N than ombrotrophic Sphagnum litter. Overall, we observed slower N release from litter of ombrotrophic vascular plant species compared to minerotrophic vascular plant species. No single chemical parameter could predict the variability associated with different functional groups. The release of K was very high compared to all the other nutrients and rather similar between ombrotrophic and minerotrophic litter types. In Sphagnum litter, a higher C/P quotient was associated with a slower P mineralisation, whereas a faster P release from vascular plant litter seems primarily associated with lower C/P and polyphenols/P quotients.

AB Boreal peatlands store an enormous pool of soil carbon that is dependent upon - and vulnerable to changes in - climate, as well as plant community composition. However, how nutrient availability affects the effects of climate and vegetation change on ecosystem processes in these nutrient-poor ecosystems remains unclear. Here we show that although warming promoted higher CH4 emissions, the concurrent addition of N counteracted most (79%) of this effect. The regulation effects of the vegetation functional group, associated with the substrate quality, suggest that CH4 emissions from peatlands under future warming will be less than expected with predicted shrub expansion. In contrast, N2O flux will be enhanced under future warming with predicted shrub expansion. Our study suggests that changes in greenhouse gas emissions in response to future warming and shifts in plant community composition depend on N availability, which reveals the complex interactions that occur when N is not a limiting nutrient.

AB Nitrogen and phosphorus were added experimentally in a bog in the southern Alps. It was hypothesized that alleviating nutrient limitation will increase vascular plant cover. As a consequence, more carbon will be fixed through higher rates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE).
   The vascular cover did increase at the expense of Sphagnum mosses. However, such vegetation changes were largely independent of the treatment and were probably triggered by an exceptional heatwave in summer 2003.
   Contrary to the tested hypothesis, NEE was unaffected by the nutrient treatments but was strongly influenced by temperature and water-table depth. In particular, ecosystem respiration in the hot summer of 2003 increased dramatically, presumably owing to enhanced heterotrophic respiration in an increased oxic peat layer.
   At the end of the experiment, the Sphagnum cover decreased significantly in the nitrogen-fertilized treatment at hummock microhabitats. In the long term, this will imply a proportionally greater accumulation of vascular litter, more easily decomposable than the recalcitrant Sphagnum litter. As a result, rates of carbon fixation may decrease because of stimulated respiration.

AB Wetlands are the largest natural source of atmospheric methane(1), the second most important greenhouse gas(2). Methane flux to the atmosphere depends strongly on the climate(3); however, by far the largest part of the methane formed in wetland ecosystems is recycled and does not reach the atmosphere(4,5). The biogeochemical controls on the efficient oxidation of methane are still poorly understood. Here we show that submerged Sphagnum mosses, the dominant plants in some of these habitats, consume methane through symbiosis with partly endophytic methanotrophic bacteria, leading to highly effective in situ methane recycling. Molecular probes revealed the presence of the bacteria in the hyaline cells of the plant and on stem leaves. Incubation with C-13-methane showed rapid in situ oxidation by these bacteria to carbon dioxide, which was subsequently fixed by Sphagnum, as shown by incorporation of C-13-methane into plant sterols. In this way, methane acts as a significant ( 10 - 15%) carbon source for Sphagnum. The symbiosis explains both the efficient recycling of methane and the high organic carbon burial in these wetland ecosystems.

AB Natural peatlands are the world's most area-effective carbon sinks. However, over 90% of German, 40% of European and 10-20% of global peatlands have been degraded and converted into carbon sources, primarily because of agricultural drainage. Against this background, rewetting and more sensible uses of peat soils for agriculture are internationally recognized as effective potential options to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents estimates of the GHG mitigation potential and abatement costs of different peatland management options by using the example of farm models that represent typical farm types in an intensive grassland-use peatland region in southern Germany. Therefore, an optimization model at the farm level that includes the emissions from all relevant sources in the production process is used.
   The current net GHG emissions of the farm models range from 10 to 12.9 tCO(2)e ha(-1) a(-1), of which the peat soil borne emissions make up a noticeable share. The rewetting and conversion of medium-drained grassland into wet grassland lead to considerable reductions of GHG emissions. However, in intensively managed dairy farms, the full emission Mitigation potential of these peatland management options is not realized, because necessary adaptations increase emissions from other sources. Because of its low GHG mitigation potential, the conversion of arable land into medium drained intensive grassland leads to high abatement costs of up to 92(sic)/tCO(2)e, while the abatement costs of the rewetting and conversion into wet grassland range from 5 to 57(sic)/tCO(2)e. The results vary by farm type, intensity of agricultural peatland use to date and the share of peatland area on a farm. This stresses the need for individual farm approaches and impact analyses for planned peatland renaturations. The findings also show that the overall costs to compensate farmer income loss from planned peatland renaturations will be as high as they are for more intensively managed dairy farms, which will be located in and affected in the respective area. The modelling approach presented has the potential to be adapted to the needs of peatland farm systems in other countries of the temperate zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fire is an important control on the carbon (C) balance of the boreal forest region. Here, we present findings from two complementary studies that examine how fire modifies soil organic matter properties, and how these modifications influence rates of decomposition and C exchange in black spruce (Picea mariana) ecosystems of interior Alaska. First, we used laboratory incubations to explore soil temperature, moisture, and vegetation effects on CO2 and DOC production rates in burned and unburned soils from three study regions in interior Alaska. Second, at one of the study regions used in the incubation experiments, we conducted intensive field measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across an unreplicated factorial design of burning (2 year post-fire versus unburned sites) and drainage class (upland forest versus peatland sites). Our laboratory study showed that burning reduced the sensitivity of decomposition to increased temperature, most likely by inducing moisture or substrate quality limitations on decomposition rates. Burning also reduced the decomposability of Sphagnum-derived organic matter, increased the hydrophobicity of feather moss-derived organic matter, and increased the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in both the upland and peatland sites. At the ecosystem scale, our field measurements indicate that the surface organic soil was generally wetter in burned than in unburned sites, whereas soil temperature was not different between the burned and unburned sites. Analysis of variance results showed that ER varied with soil drainage class but not by burn status, averaging 0.9 +/- 0.1 and 1.4 +/- 0.1 g C m(-2) d(-1) in the upland and peatland sites, respectively. However, a more complex general linear model showed that ER was controlled by an interaction between soil temperature, moisture, and burn status, and in general was less variable over time in the burned than in the unburned sites. Together, findings from these studies across different spatial scales suggest that although fire can create some soil climate conditions more conducive to rapid decomposition, rates of C release from soils may be constrained following fire by changes in moisture and/or substrate quality that impede rates of decomposition.

AB High productivity and waterlogged conditions make many freshwater wetlands significant carbon sinks. Most wetland carbon studies focus on boreal peatlands, however, with less attention paid to other climates and to the effects of hydrogeomorphic settings and the importance of wetland vegetation communities on carbon sequestration. This study compares six temperate wetland communities in Ohio that belong to two distinct hydrogeomorphic types: an isolated depressional wetland site connected to the groundwater table, and a riverine flow-through wetland site that receives water from an agricultural watershed. Three cores were extracted in each community and analyzed for total carbon content to determine the soil carbon pool. Sequestration rates were determined by radiometric dating with 137Cs and 210Pb on a set of composite cores extracted in each of the six communities. Cores were also extracted in uplands adjacent to the wetlands at each site. Wetland communities had accretion rates ranging from 3.0 to 6.2 mm yr-1. The depressional wetland sites had higher (P < 0.001) organic content (146 +/- 4.2 gC kg-1) and lower (P < 0.001) bulk density (0.55 +/- 0.01 Mg m-3) than the riverine ones (50.1 +/- 6.9 gC kg-1 and 0.74 +/- 0.06 Mg m-3). The soil carbon was 9899% organic in the isolated depressional wetland communities and 8598% organic in the riverine ones. The depressional wetland communities sequestered 317 +/- 93 gC m-2 yr-1, more (P < 0.01) than the riverine communities that sequestered 140 +/- 16 gC m-2 yr-1. The highest sequestration rate was found in the Quercus palustris forested wetland community (473 gC m-2 yr-1), while the wetland community dominated by water lotus (Nelumbo lutea) was the most efficient of the riverine communities, sequestering 160 gC m-2 yr-1. These differences in sequestration suggest the importance of addressing wetland types and communities in more detail when assessing the role of wetlands as carbon sequestering systems in global carbon budgets.

AB Fens are underestimated carbon sinks. Knowledge about their role in the sequestration of CO2 in the past is limited. The research reported here focused on identifying long-term carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in a drained fen (Bagno Bruch) and a waterlogged fen (Bagno Mikoeska) in southern Poland. On the basis of Pb-210 and AMS C-14 dates and age-depth modeling, 7000- and 2000-year records of changes in bulk composition and carbon and sulfur content are presented and discussed. Strong human impact is detected, especially in Bagno Bruch. However, minor climatic signals linked to the Little Ice Age' and to the influence of wind-blown sands are also evident. The sand may have influenced the plant composition, peat accumulation rates (PARs), and CARs, in addition to the bulk composition at Bagno Mikoeska. The mean value of the CAR in the youngest peat layers spanning the last 200years is generally lower in two cores from Bagno Bruch (c. 85 and 86g/m(2)/yr) than in two cores from Bagno Mikoeska (c. 140 and 142g/m(2)/yr). The fens are characterized by higher CARs compared with boreal peatlands. The reproducibility of the CAR values is the most promising result, suggesting the low mobility of Pb-210 and the reliability of this method in assessing the chronology of fens.

AB In this paper, we analyse the ability of the JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) model to simulate the physical conditions in the terrestrial Arctic using satellite-based earth observation data products. Catchment-average seasonal surface temperatures and snow cover are constructed over the largest river basins of the Eurasian Arctic (the Ob, Lena and Yenisei) and compared with the modelled values. The results indicate that the modelled snow cover decreases too quickly in spring in all studied areas, and that the modelled surface temperature of snow-free areas is too high. There are several causes of uncertainty in both the model outputs and the earth observation products, and care has to be taken to ensure consistent use and sampling of the data. The results indicate that earth observation products provide important information that can assist in the diagnosis of problems in a land-surface model.

AB In the discontinuous permafrost zone of boreal western continental Canada, permafrost is limited almost exclusively to ombrotrophic peatlands. Permafrost in peatlands recently has been degrading and continues to degrade at its southern limit across western Canada, with no evidence of regeneration. The melting of permafrost could have dramatic effects on organic matter accumulation, organochemical properties, and nutrient status in peatlands. Our objectives are to quantify differences in peat chemistry (i.e., concentrations of organic fractions, N, P, and S) and rates of organic matter accumulation over the past 200 years between a site with permafrost, a site with degraded permafrost (internal lawn), and three sites with no evidence of permafrost since the last glaciation (continental peatlands: two bogs and one poor Fen). Results indicate that pear chemistry may differ according to the presence, absence, or degradation of permafrost. Recent rates of organic matter accumulation follow similar trends over the past 100-200 years in the permafrost and continental bogs; however, net rates of organic matter accumulation are accelerated by 60% in the internal lawn. As decomposition in peatlands is influenced by nutrient limitations and organic matter quality, peat chemistry is likely to be a critical factor in the carbon balance response of boreal peatlands to climate change.

AB Peatlands are one of the largest terrestrial stores of carbon. Carbon exchange in peatlands is often assessed solely by measurement of contemporary fluxes; however, these fluxes frequently indicate a much stronger sink strength than that measured by the rate of C accumulation in the peat profile over longer timescales. Here we compare profile-based measurements of C accumulation with the published net ecosystem C balance for the largest peatland area in Britain, the Flow Country of northern Scotland. We estimate the long-term rate of C accumulation to be 15.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for a site where a recent eddy covariance study has suggested contemporary C uptake more than six times greater (99.37 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Our estimate is supported by two further long-term C accumulation records from nearby sites which give comparable results. We demonstrate that a strong contemporary C sink strength may not equate to a strong long-term sink and explore reasons for this disparity. We recommend that contemporary C sequestration should be viewed in the context of the long-term ecological drivers, such as fires, ecohydrological feedbacks and the changing quality of litter inputs.

AB Under predicted scenarios of global climate change, peatlands may become a net source of greenhouse gases which will accelerate warming of the atmosphere. Comparative studies of peat bogs along present climatic gradients may provide an insight into the future response of boreal and subarctic peatlands to changing temperature and moisture. Three maritime peat bogs in the British Isles, and two high-elevation peatlands in the Czech Republic were studied. All sites were relatively wet, the mean annual temperatures were higher by up to 6 degrees C at the British/Irish sites than at the Czech sites. Cumulative carbon content in Pb-210-dated Sphagnum-dominated vertical peat cores increased from the warmer to the colder sites when evaluated for the most recent decades (since ca. 1950). That would correspond to formation of thinner, more highly decomposed peat deposits over the long-term in warmer conditions, and deeper peat bogs in colder conditions. However, when cumulative carbon content was evaluated for the last ca. 150 years, no relationship was found between mean annual temperature and the carbon pool size. Even along broad present-day climatic gradients, site-specific factors controlled organic carbon preservation in peat. Pollen analysis was instrumental in corroborating the Pb-210 dates, identifying wet and dry periods in the past, and it also provided evidence for increasing nitrogen loads in wetland areas.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine peat formation processes throughout the millennia in four tidal marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Peat cores collected at each site were analyzed for bulk density, loss on ignition, and percent organic carbon. Core data and spline fit age-depth models were used to estimate inorganic sedimentation, organic accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates in the marshes. Bulk density and percent organic matter content of peat fluctuated through time at all sites, suggesting that peat formation processes are dynamic and responsive to watershed conditions. The balance between inorganic sedimentation and organic accumulation at the sites also varied through time, indicating that marshes may rely more strongly on either inorganic or organic matter for peat formation at particular times in their existence. Mean carbon sequestration rates found in this study (0.38-0.79 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) were similar to other long-term estimates for temperate peatlands.

AB The fate of carbon sequestered in permafrost is a key concern for future global warming as this large carbon stock is rapidly becoming a net methane source due to widespread thaw. Methane release from permafrost is moderated by methanotrophs, which oxidise 20-60% of this methane before emission to the atmosphere. Despite the importance of methanotrophs to carbon cycling, these microorganisms are under-characterised and have not been studied across a natural permafrost thaw gradient. Here, we examine methanotroph communities from the active layer of a permafrost thaw gradient in Stordalen Mire (Abisko, Sweden) spanning three years, analysing 188 metagenomes and 24 metatranscriptomes paired with in situ biogeochemical data. Methanotroph community composition and activity varied significantly as thaw progressed from intact permafrost palsa, to partially thawed bog and fully thawed fen. Thirteen methanotroph population genomes were recovered, including two novel genomes belonging to the uncultivated upland soil cluster alpha (USCa) group and a novel potentially methanotrophic Hyphomicrobiaceae. Combined analysis of porewater delta C-13-CH 4 isotopes and methanotroph abundances showed methane oxidation was greatest below the oxic-anoxic interface in the bog. These results detail the direct effect of thaw on autochthonous methanotroph communities, and their consequent changes in population structure, activity and methane moderation potential.

AB In view of the extremely important role of wetlands, an attempt was made to determine the state of preservation of peat forming processes as a condition for the proper functioning of those areas. By addressing this question, we hoped to determine whether the peat bogs and mires of the Lcczna-Wlodawa Plain currently act as carbon sources. The aim of the present study was to compare the ash content and the contents of selected macro-and micronutrients in the deposits. The research was carried out in the years 2010-2013 and covered eight peatland areas (three midfield and five mid-forest peatlands). The ash content, as well as the content of biogens, and selected macro- and micronutrients of the studied deposits varied and depended on the type of the deposit forming a given layer. In all the studied deposits, the carbon content was high, especially in the transitional Sedge-Sphagnum peat and the raised pine peat. The marsh layers, in relation to the studied peat minerals and gyttja, were characterized by a lower carbon content, and the restriction of C:N and N:P ratios. In all the studied peat bogs, located in the Lcczna-Wlodawa Plain, the accumulation phase dominated, so they do not act as carbon suppliers.

AB Thawing permafrost in the sub-Arctic has implications for the physical stability and biological dynamics of peatland ecosystems. This study provides an analysis of how permafrost thawing and subsequent vegetation changes in a sub-Arctic Swedish mire have changed the net exchange of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 over the past three decades. Images of the mire (ca. 17 ha) and surroundings taken with film sensitive in the visible and the near infrared portion of the spectrum, [i.e. colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs from 1970 and 2000] were used. The results show that during this period the area covered by hummock vegetation decreased by more than 11% and became replaced by wet-growing plant communities. The overall net uptake of C in the vegetation and the release of C by heterotrophic respiration might have increased resulting in increases in both the growing season atmospheric CO2 sink function with about 16% and the CH4 emissions with 22%. Calculating the flux as CO2 equivalents show that the mire in 2000 has a 47% greater radiative forcing on the atmosphere using a 100-year time horizon. Northern peatlands in areas with thawing sporadic or discontinuous permafrost are likely to act as larger greenhouse gas sources over the growing season today than a few decades ago because of increased CH4 emissions.

AB There is growing interest in how the rewetting of drained peatlands can restart their carbon (C) sink function. However, there are few studies on the effect of ditch blocking on the within-ditch C balance. For a UK blanket bog we assessed how methane (CH4) emissions, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e) responded to ditch blocking.
   We conducted a fully replicated field trial on a blanket bog in the Upper Conwy catchment, North Wales, UK. Twelve parallel ditches, that ran approximately downslope, were investigated. Four were left open, four had peat dams installed at intervals of a few metres along their length, and four were partially infilled with peat (reprofiled) and dammed. For a period of four years after blocking, we measured peatland-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 and CO2 within the ditches.
   CH4 fluxes, NEE and overall GHG balance (expressed in terms of CO2-e) in the experimental area showed no evidence of varying systematically between the different types of ditch treatment (open, dammed, and reprofiled). In addition, there was little evidence that CH4 fluxes or CO2-e balance changed systematically with time since blocking.
   We found no evidence of consistent differences between blocking treatments in terms of CH4 emissions or overall CO2-e balance. There was high spatial and temporal variability in CO2 and CH4 fluxes within each treatment. We did not observe a post-blocking 'spike' in CH4 fluxes.

AB Understanding the development of northern peatlands and their carbon accumulation dynamics is crucial in order to confidently integrate northern peatlands into global carbon cycle models. To achieve this, northern peatland models are becoming increasingly complex and now include feedback processes between peat depth, decomposition, hydrology, and vegetation composition and productivity. Here we present results from a global sensitivity analysis performed to assess the behavior and parameter interaction of a peatland simulation model. A series of simulations of the Holocene Peat Model were performed with different parameter combinations in order to assess the role of parameter interactions on the simulated total carbon mass after 5000 years of peatland development. The impact of parameter uncertainty on the simulation results is highlighted, as is the importance of multiple parameter interactions. The model sensitivity indicates that peat physical properties play an important role in peat accumulation; these parameters are poorly constrained by observations and should be a focus of future research. Furthermore, the results show that autogenic processes are able to produce a wide range of peatland development behaviors independently of any external environmental changes.

AB Fourteen tree-ring chronologies developed from 788 peatland Scots pines sampled at sites in Estonia, Belarus and Sweden were compared for common growth trends and possible links to regional climate dynamics. Several synchronous growth release events were detected, especially during the 1910s, 1930s, and around 1970 and 1990, indicating that hydrological shifts and associated tree growth responses have been governed by similar forcing mechanisms, at least during the 20th century. In general, the best agreements were observed between the tree populations from Estonia and Belarus, but synchronous growth changes could also be detected between the Swedish and Estonian material. Trends detected in single tree-ring chronologies may be linked to local peatland management or land-use changes, whereas common variations detected at multiple sites are more likely linked to hydrological changes in the peatlands associated with regional climate dynamics. Understanding the links between climate and processes that involve peatland hydrology and vegetation responses is important since peatland ecosystems are key players in the global carbon cycle.

LA English
DT Article
DE ombrotrophic bogs; microbial ecology; methane; climate change
ID METHANE; WETLANDS
AB Gases are produced from wetlands when plant biomass is degraded by microbial consortia, producing carbon dioxide aerobically and methane when oxygen is lacking. In anaerobic waterlogged situations, such as the catotelm of ombrotrophic bogs, this methane forms minute gas bubbles that severely reduce the hydraulic conductivity and hence the degradation of biomass due to the lack of nutrients. The bogs thus became carbon sinks, formed from the partially degraded biomass that accumulates as peat. The results of an investigation of an ombrotrophic bog, Mer Bleue, Ontario, Canada are summarized here, and the effects that climate change may have on such bogs are discussed. Any change of the water table in wetlands will have a substantial effect upon their ecology. If the water table should fall allowing bogs to become aerobic, most of the accumulated biomass carbon could be returned to the atmosphere by degradation to carbon dioxide, and as well, methane entrapped within the matrix would be released directly to the atmosphere. If on the other hand, the bogs are flooded, then the entrapped bubbles will coalesce allowing the gas to escape to the atmosphere, while at the same time the degradation of the peat will be enhanced.

AB Globally, wetlands are in decline due to anthropogenic modification and climate change. Knowledge about the spatial distribution of biodiversity and biological processes within wetlands provides essential baseline data for predicting and mitigating the effects of present and future environmental change on these critical ecosystems. To explore the potential for environmental DNA (eDNA) to provide such insights, we used 16S rRNA metabarcoding to characterise prokaryote communities and predict the distribution of prokaryote metabolic pathways in peats and sediments up to 4m below the surface across seven New Zealand wetlands. Our results reveal distinct vertical structuring of prokaryote communities and metabolic pathways in these wetlands. We also find evidence for differences in the relative abundance of certain metabolic pathways that may correspond to the degree of anthropogenic modification the wetlands have experienced. These patterns, specifically those for pathways related to aerobic respiration and the carbon cycle, can be explained predominantly by the expected effects of wetland drainage. Our study demonstrates that eDNA has the potential to be an important new tool for the assessment and monitoring of wetland health.

TI Subsidence Rates of Drained Agricultural Peatlands in New Zealand and
   the Relationship with Time since Drainage
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

DT Article
ID CARBON LOSS; PEAT SOILS; ORGANIC SOILS; LAND SUBSIDENCE; WASTAGE;
   PASTURE; AREA
AB The drainage and conversion of peatlands to productive agro-ecosystems leads to ongoing surface subsidence because of densification (shrinkage and consolidation) and oxidation of the peat substrate. Knowing the rate of this surface subsidence is important for future land-use planning, carbon accounting, and economic analysis of drainage and pumping costs. We measured subsidence rates over the past decade at 119 sites across three large, agriculturally managed peatlands in the Waikato region, New Zealand. The average contemporary (2000s-2012) subsidence rate for Waikato peatlands was 19 +/- 2 mm yr(-1) (+/- SE) and was significantly less (p = 0.01) than the historic rate of 26 +/- 1 mm yr(-1) between the 1920s and 2000s. A reduction in the rate of subsidence through time was attributed to the transition from rapid initial consolidation and shrinkage to slower, long-term, ongoing oxidation. These subsidence rates agree well with a literature synthesis of temperate zone subsidence rates reported for similar lengths of time since drainage. A strong nonlinear relationship was found between temperate zone subsidence rates and time since initial peatland drainage: Subsidence (mm yr(-1)) = 226 x (years since drained)(-0.59) (R-2 = 0.88). This relationship suggests that time since drainage exerts strong control over the rate of peatland subsidence and that ongoing peatland subsidence rates can be predicted to gradually decline with time in the absence of major land disturbance.

AB Climate change has been proposed as a driver of carbon (C) loss from the large pool of C held in soils. Aqueous (dissolved organic carbon, DOC) and gaseous (soil respiration or net ecosystem CO(2) exchange) forms of C loss from soils have been considered. Under some climate change scenarios, gaseous emissions of C have been predicted to result in terrestrial ecosystems becoming a net source of C by 2050. Indeed, both forms of C loss have been linked to climate-related changes, such as warming and/or changes in precipitation. In our field-based drought manipulation experiment on an upland moorland in northeast Wales, we have carried out an annual drought treatment for 8 years, reducing levels of annual rainfall by 23% on average (1999-2007) through the use of automated roofs, which prevent rain falling on experimental plots between June and September annually. Following 5 years of repeated summer drought, there was a 26% increase in concentrations of DOC in soil water in the mineral soil in the drought plots and this further increased to 52% after 8 years. A similar pattern was not observed in the organic soil horizons. Despite higher DOC concentrations in the mineral soil horizon, decreased drainage of water from the drought-treated soils resulted in an overall decrease of 9% in total DOC export. Calculating the carbon (C) balance for the below-ground component of the ecosystem reveals that DOC represents 3% of gross C export. Previous studies at the site have demonstrated large increases in soil respiration resulting from the repeated drought treatment. By including data presented here with other C fluxes and pool measurements from the site, we demonstrate that soil carbon is accumulating by 126 g C m(-2) year(-1) in the control plots, but decreasing by 18 g C m(-2) year(-1) in the drought plots. The repeated drought treatment has thus resulted in the ecosystem switching from a net sink for C into a net source.

AB The succession of vegetation, soil development, water quality changes, and carbon and nitrogen dynamics are summarized in this article for a pair of 1-hectare flow-through-created riverine wetlands for their first 15 years. Wetland plant richness increased from 13 originally planted species to 116 species overall after 15 years, with most of the increase occurring in the first 5 years. The planted wetland had a higher plant community diversity index for 15 years, whereas the implanted wetland was more productive. Wetland soils turned hydric within a few years; soil organic carbon doubled in 10 years and almost tripled in 15 years. Nutrient removal was similar in the two wetlands in most years, with a trend of decreased removal over 15 years for phosphorus. Denitrification accounted for a small percentage of the nitrogen reduction in the wetlands. The wetlands were effective carbon sinks with retention rates of 1800-2700 kilograms of carbon per hectare per year, higher than in comparable reference wetlands and more commonly studied boreal peatlands. Methane emission rates are low enough to create little concern that the wetlands are net sources of climate change radiative forcing. Planting appears to have influenced carbon accumulation, methane emissions, and macrophyte community diversity.

AB Tarnocai, C. and Bockheim, J. G. 2011. Cryosolic soils of Canada: Genesis, distribution, and classification. Can. J. Soil. Sci. 91: 749-762. Cryosols are permafrost-affected soils whose genesis is dominated by cryogenic processes, resulting in unique macromorphologies, micromorphologies, thermal characteristics, and physical and chemical properties. In addition, these soils are carbon sinks, storing high amounts of organic carbon collected for thousands of years. In the Canadian soil classification, the Cryosolic Order includes mineral and organic soils that have both cryogenic properties and permafrost within 1 or 2 m of the soil surface. This soil order is divided into Turbic, Static and Organic great groups on the basis of the soil materials (mineral or organic), cryogenic properties and depth to permafrost. The great groups are subdivided into subgroups on the basis of soil development and the resulting diagnostic soil horizons. Cryosols are commonly associated with the presence of ground ice in the subsoil. This causes serious problems when areas containing these soils are used for agriculture and construction projects (such as roads, town sites and airstrips). Therefore, where Cryosols have high ice content, it is especially important either to avoid these activities or to use farming and construction methods that maintain the negative thermal balance.

AB 1 In a 4-year fertilization experiment we studied the effects of increased nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) supply on productivity and potential decay in the acrotelm of Sphagnum-dominated Swedish peatlands at northern (low atmospheric N input: low-N site) and southern (high atmospheric N input: high-N site) sites.
   2 During the experimental period, there was a severe summer drought at the high-N site which led to strong limitations on Sphagnum growth, especially in the fertilized treatments. There were no significant effects of the nutrient treatments on cumulative length growth and productivity at either site. There were, however, significant effects of site and nutrient treatment on nutritional variables of the Sphagnum species.
   3 Nitrogen concentration in living capitula was lower, but P concentration was higher at the low-N site than at the high-N site. However, at both sites N and P concentration in the living capitula showed only minor responses to the nutrient additions.
   4 Litter chemistry variables differed significantly among sites and treatments. Sphagnum litter had lower N concentration, higher P concentration, a higher C : N ratio, a lower C : P ratio and a lower N : P ratio at the low-N site. Litter chemistry was significantly affected by the nutrient treatments only at the high-N site, where litter P concentrations increased significantly in the P-fertilized treatment, whereas C : P and N : P ratios showed a significant reduction.
   5 Although potential rates of decay of Sphagnum litter were higher at the high-N site than at the low-N site, they were not significantly affected by nutrient additions. Potential decay rates did, however, show significant relations with all the litter chemistry variables we had determined.
   6 An increase in nitrogen input to Sphagnum-dominated bogs appears to lead to higher N concentrations in litter and, as a result of dilution, to lower P concentrations. This change in litter chemistry leads to a higher potential decay rate of the litter and this may seriously affect the carbon balance in the acrotelm of these systems.
   7 Our results also show that carbon balance characteristics of Sphagnum bogs can be strongly affected by unpredictable extreme climatic conditions. This suggests that the occurrence and consequences of these events need more attention when long-term responses of ecosystems to global change are studied.

AB Silage was used as source of carbon and electrons for enrichment of silage-degrading and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) from boreal, acidic, metals-containing peat-bog samples and to support their use in batch and semi-batch systems in treatment of synthetic waste water. Sulfidogenic silage utilization resulted in a rapid decrease in lactate concentrations; concentrations of acetate, butyrate and propionate increased concomitantly. Synthetic waste water consisting of Mn, Mg and Fe (II) ions inhibited sulfate reduction at concentrations of 6 g/l, 8 g/l and 1 g/l respectively. During treatment, Mn and Mg ions remained in solution while Fe ions partially precipitated. Up to 87 mg sulfate was reduced per gram of silage. Sulfate reduction rates of 34, 22 and 6 mg/l/day were obtained at temperatures of 30, 20 and 9 C respectively. In semi-batch reactors operated at low pH, the iron precipitation capacity was controlled by sulfate reduction rates and by partial loss of hydrogen sulfide to the gas phase. Passive reactor systems should, therefore, be operated at neutral pH. Metals tolerant, silage-fermenting (predominantly species belonging to genus Clostridium) and sulfate reducing bacteria (including a species similar to the psychrotolerant Desulfovibrio arcticus) were obtained from the peat bog samples. This work demonstrates that silage supports sulfate reduction and can be used as a low cost carbon and electron source for SRB in treatment of metals-containing waste water. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study reports on 27 days of CO2 flux measurements from wetland tundra in the vicinity of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Fluxes were measured continuously using a portable, gradient measurement system which is described in detail. The measurements apply to a climatically normal summer in terms of solar radiation, temperature and precipitation. The environment consists of a hummocky fen underlain by permafrost with a thick layer of organic soils. Sedges dominated the hummocks and mosses the hollows. The measurement period was composed of a dry period when the water table receded below the lowest terrain elements and a wet period when there was standing water in the hollows. On average for the measurement period, and on most days, the carbon balance was positive, meaning that carbon loss through respiration exceeded the gain through photosynthesis. Respiration was greater and photosynthesis less during the dry period than the wet period. The magnitude of the daily average CO2 flux in this study was comparable to summer fluxes measured in similar ecosystems. The implications of a net carbon loss during the most photosynthetically active period are discussed.

AB The sensitivity of soil carbon and nitrogen to warming is a major uncertainty in projections of climate. However, previous studies about soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and potential emission predominantly concentrated on the shallow soil layer in high latitude ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed the SOC, total nitrogen (TN) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks, C/N ratios, and stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) in the active layer and permafrost layer on the Eboling Mountain in the upper reach of Heihe River basin, northwestern China. Our results showed that the average stocks of SOC, TN, and SIC in permafrost layer above soil parent materials (71.7 kg m(-2), 8.0 kg m(-2), 34.7 kg m(-2)) were much higher than those in the active layer (44.3 kg m(-2), 5.3 kg m(-2), 12.2 kg m(-2)). The delta C-13 pattern in the soil profiles indicated that historical drainage conditions and pedogenesis were important factors in determining soil organic matter (SOM) stocks in this permafrost region. The delta C-13 and C/N ratios of the transient layer and some layers of permafrost implied that the degradation of SOM was different. These results highlight that carbon and nitrogen in permafrost regions with Alpine Kobresia meadow could make significant contribution to China's terrestrial carbon cycle.

AB Effects of anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) on Rhizoctonia solani basal rot of lettuce were assessed considering: two soil types; different C-sources; different temperature regimes; two treatment durations; and two lettuce crop cycles, in the presence of a high disease incidence from artificial infestation with the pathogen. C-source, temperature, and incubation period, and their interaction, affected the efficacy of the ASD treatment for the lettuce-R. solani pathosystem, with differences depending on the soil type. Brassica carinata pellets, used as a C-source, reduced incidence of Rhizoctonia basal rot in the first crop cycle by 50 to 69% in a peat soil after 3 weeks of treatment at 21 degrees C, and by 52 to 60% after 3 weeks of treatment at 26 or 31 degrees C, compared to the inoculated and untreated experimental controls without anaerobic conditions. The best disease reduction was provided by B. carinata pellets applied, under anaerobic conditions, to peat soil (79% efficacy) and a sandy loam soil (100% efficacy) kept at 31 degrees C for 6 weeks. Generally, ASD based on B. carinata pellets provided greater disease reduction in the first crop cycle than the second, with the only exception being for results achieved in both soils incubated for 6 weeks at 21, 26 and 31 degrees C. Wild rocket used as a C-source provided the greatest disease reduction (78-83%) on plants grown in peat soil at the first crop cycle after 6 weeks of the ASD treatment at 31 degrees C, while wild rocket provided disease reduction of 29 and 50% when mixed with the sandy-loam soil under the same conditions for 6 weeks. The efficacy of the ASD treatment with compost was improved in the second crop cycle, compared to the first, resulting in the greatest disease reduction (52 and 66% efficacy) reached in the sandy-loam soil incubated for 3 weeks at 21 degrees C, and 63% efficacy in peat soil previously treated for 6 weeks at 26 and 31 degrees C. However, slight reductions in lettuce plant development was generally evident in the first crop cycle, which could be due to differences in efficacy of the tested ASD treatments and to phytotoxicity. The greatest yield from sandy loam soil was obtained for the B. carinata pellets and wild rocket at 26 and 31 degrees C in the second cultivation cycle. Partial efficacy of ASD does not justify the adoption of this method against R. solani on lettuce under intensive crop systems. However, ASD based on Brassicaceae and compost as carbon source applied in a sandy-loam soil may be valuable for reducing R. solani incidence, at lower temperatures than those required for soil solarisation or biosolarisation.

AB Rotifers are among the smallest metazoan animals living in lakes, ponds, rivers and in interstitial water within Sphagnum mats. When in sufficient numbers they are capable of regenerating large amounts of nitrogen (N) as NO3 and NH4 and phosphorus (P) as PO4; all of these nutrients are immediately available to bog plants. The ecological role of rotifers in bog ecosystems has been recognized at both local and global scales, but the effect of N and P addition on rotifers in bogs remains unknown. Here we present data on the influence of N and P addition on rotifers at a temperate Canadian bog dominated by Sphagnum mosses. We found that rotifer species abundance and diversity were significantly higher in surficial pore water after long-tenn exposure to increased N and P addition than in the control. A change in plant species distribution and increased rotifer abundance may partly explain the faster decomposition rates, jeopardizing the carbon sink capacity of bogs.

AB The effect of pre-treated peat moss on the ability of a sulfate-reducing microbial consortium to remove chromium and lead in solution was evaluated. The most active bacterial community (235.7 mmol H2S/g VSS) was selected from among eight consortia. The peat moss was pre-treated with different HCl concentrations and contact times. The best combination of treatments was 20% HCl for 10 mm. The constant substrate affinity Ks was 740 mg COD/L and the ratio COD/SO42- was 0.71. At pH 5, higher production of biogenic sulfide was observed. The up-flowpacked bed bioreactor operated at a flow of 8.3 mL/min for 180 h to obtain removal efficiency (by sulfate-reducing activity) of 90% lead and 65% chromium. It is important to consider that peat moss is a natural adsorbent that further influences the removal efficiency of metal ions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As the largest plateau-type wetland in the world and the largest peat storage in China, Zoige wetland faces severe water decline, and consequently accelerated peat degradation and carbon emission. Here, a variety of characterization approaches, including elemental analysis, UV-vis spectra, FT-IR spectra, and solid state C-13 NMR spectra were used to investigate the degradation and the structural shift of humic acids (HAs) in correspondence with serious water loss in Zoige peatland. Water loss derived from both natural slope and artificial drainage caused a substantial degradation of organic matter and HAs. Compared with the blocks immersed by free surface water, HAs extracted from the drier blocks had more pronounced signals of carboxyl and carbonyl groups, but carried lower content of methoxyl, carbohydrate, alcohol and ether groups. The total aliphatic carbon in HAs from natural-slope drier site decreased almost one half, but in the artificial-drained site, only slightly decreased. Correspondingly, the HA aromaticity substantially increased in the site undergoing the longer time of aerobic oxidation, whereas varied little in the site impacted by extensive water leaching.

AB Permafrost is a large reservoir of soil organic carbon, accounting for about half of all the terrestrial storage, almost equivalent to twice the atmospheric carbon storage. Hence, permafrost degradation under global warming may induce a release of a substantial amount of additional greenhouse gases, leading to further warming. In addition to gradual degradation through heat conduction, the importance of abrupt thawing or erosion of ice-rich permafrost has recently been recognized. Such ice-rich permafrost has evolved over a long timescale (i.e., tens to hundreds of thousands of years). Although important, knowledge on the distribution of vulnerability to degradation, i.e., location and stored amount of ground ice and soil carbon in ice-rich permafrost, is still limited largely due to the scarcity of accessible in situ data. Improving the future projections for the Arctic using the Earth System Models will lead to a better understanding of the current vulnerability distribution, which is a prerequisite for conducting climatic and biogeochemical assessment that currently constitutes a large source of uncertainty. In this study, present-day circum-Arctic distributions (north of 50 degrees N) in ground ice and organic soil carbon content are produced by a new approach to combine a newly developed conceptual carbon-ice balance model, and a downscaling technique with the topographical and hydrological information derived from a high-resolution digital elevation model (ETOPO1). The model simulated the evolution of ground ice and carbon for the recent 125 thousand years (from the Last Interglacial to the present) at 1 degrees resolution. The 0.2 degrees high-resolution circum-Arctic maps of the present-day ground ice and soil organic carbon, downscaled from the 1 degrees simulations, were reasonable compared to the observation-based previous maps. These data, together with a map of vulnerability of ice-rich permafrost to degradation served as initial and boundary condition data for model improvement and the future projection of additional greenhouse gas release potentially caused by permafrost degradation.

AB We used radiocarbon measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to resolve sources of riverine carbon within agriculturally dominated landscapes in California. During 2003 and 2004, average Delta(14)C for DOC was -254aEuro degrees in agricultural drains in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, -218aEuro degrees in the San Joaquin River, -175aEuro degrees in the California State Water Project and -152aEuro degrees in the Sacramento River. The age of bulk DOC transiting the rivers of California's Central Valley is the oldest reported for large rivers and suggests wide-spread loss of soil organic matter caused by agriculture and urbanization. Using DAX 8 adsorbent, we isolated and measured (14)C concentrations in hydrophobic acid fractions (HPOA); river samples showed evidence of bomb-pulse carbon with average Delta(14)C of 91 and 76aEuro degrees for the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers, respectively, with older HPOA, -204aEuro degrees, observed in agricultural drains. An operationally defined non-HPOA fraction of DOC was observed in the San Joaquin River with seasonally computed Delta(14)C values of between -275 and -687aEuro degrees; the source of this aged material was hypothesized to be physically protected organic-matter in high clay-content soils and agrochemicals (i.e., radiocarbon-dead material) applied to farmlands. Mixing models suggest that the Sacramento River contributes about 50% of the DOC load in the California State Water Project, and agricultural drains contribute approximately one-third of the load. In contrast to studies showing stabilization of soil carbon pools within one or two decades following land conversion, sustained loss of soil organic matter, occurring many decades after the initial agricultural-land conversion, was observed in California's Central Valley.

AB In the western, central, and eastern regions of southern Siberia (south of 60 degrees north latitude), the carbon reserves in the phytomass and mortmass, the net primary production (NPP), the removal of phytomass from the ecosystems, and the input of plant residues to the soils were assessed. The mentioned parameters characterized forests, waterlogged forests, moss-dwarf shrub bogs, grass and high mountain ecosystems, and agrocenoses. In southern Siberia, the annual phytomass stock was equal to 4500 million t of C, that of mortmass, 1340 million t of C; and the NPP and the input of plant residues were 472 million t of C and 417 million t of C per year, respectively. In the forests, the phytornass reserves were higher than those of the mortmass; in the grass ecosystems, the pattern was the opposite. Only the herbaceous ecosystems accumulate phyto- and mortmass (up to 80%) in the soils. The time of the phytomass rotation was 10 to 40 years for the bog and forest ecosystems and less than a year for the grass ecosystems and agrocenoses. The probable errors when assessing the phytomass reserves in forests are considered.

AB The stability of terrestrial carbon reservoirs is thought to be closely linked to variations in climate(1), but the magnitude of carbon-climate feedbacks has proved difficult to constrain for both modern(2-4) and millennial(5-13) timescales. Reconstructions of atmospheric CO2 concentrations for the past thousand years have shown fluctuations on multidecadal to centennial timescales(5-7), but the causes of these fluctuations are unclear. Here we report high-resolution carbon isotope measurements of CO2 trapped within the ice of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core for the past 1,000 years. We use a deconvolution approach(14) to show that changes in terrestrial organic carbon stores best explain the observed multidecadal variations in the delta C-13 of CO2 and in CO2 concentrations from 755 to 1850 CE. If significant long-term carbon emissions came from pre-industrial anthropogenic land-use changes over this interval, the emissions must have been offset by a natural terrestrial sink for C-13-depleted carbon, such as peatlands. We find that on multidecadal timescales, carbon cycle changes seem to vary with reconstructed regional climate changes. We conclude that climate variability could be an important control of fluctuations in land carbon storage on these timescales.

AB Carbon translocation was studied in two populations of two closely related, stoloniferous Vaccinium species; the sub-arctic V. microcarpum and the boreo-memoral V. oxycoccos, both growing in nutrient-poor bogs. The youngest tip of the stolen was labelled using pattern studied after four weeks of growth. The sub-arctic plants showed more acropetal translocation than the boreal plants, indicating that the stolen apex acts as a strong sink. This may reflect the larger need for this species to invest in lateral growth to be able to complete its life-cycle in the short growing season.
   The cutting-off of the apical region did not affect carbon translocation. The reason for this might be that the rapidly developing leaves just behind the apex, and nor the apex itself, are the strongest carbon sinks. Alternatively, the high respiration rate of the apex might mask the carbon transported there.
   The sub-arctic plants translocated relatively more carbon to leaves than to stolons than did the boreal plants. This might reflect the stronger need for the subarctic species to save carbon in a more readily available form to efficiently utilize the more restricted periods of growth in its climatically harsher environment.

AB Peatlands play a key role in the carbon cycle by being a considerable source of atmospheric methane. Thus, an understanding of the microbial production of methane is important in relation to environmental changes of peatlands. We applied real-time PCR on the mcrA gene and transcript to investigate the peat methanogen community response to the combined effect of 18 years of simulated warming and deposition of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) at a boreal oligotrophic mire in Sweden. The long-term effects of the experimental treatments on the methanogens was highly dependent on interactions between the treatment factors Enhanced N deposition amplified the effect of warming, resulting in a further increase of the abundance of active methanogens. The effect of the perturbations was modulated by the depth horizon, with the strongest effect at the water level, where the interaction between enhanced N and S deposition, and warming, resulted in an increase of active methanogens. These results indicate that increasing average temperatures and simultaneously higher N deposition rates will substantially increase the methanogenic activity in northern ombrotrophic peatlands. These findings strongly highlight the importance of accounting for any possible interactive perturbation effects when investigating the response of peat methanogens to environmental change.

AB Understanding the link between ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and its influential factors is necessary to evaluate the sources of gaseous carbon loss in coastal wetlands. Seablite (Suaeda salsaPall.) is the main vegetation type pioneering temperate coastal wetlands in northeast China, and is generally an understudied wetland type. To evaluate the influence of environmental factors onR(eco), a multi-year in-situ experiment was carried out during the growing seasons of 2012 to 2014. Total CO(2)efflux was measured and separated further into soil microbial and belowground root respiration (Rs + r) and plant respiration (R-plant).R(eco)displayed strong seasonal variation, with effluxes as high as 845 to 1150 mg CO(2)m(-2) h(-1)during summer months and as low as 32 to 111 mg CO(2)m(-2) h(-1)during spring (when new shoots are sprouting) and fall (when plants are senescing) months. Aboveground plant structures contributed on average 79% to total plant biomass, and accounted for most of theR(eco)measured; i.e., 62-96% was associated asR(plant). Plant activity was strongly seasonal, accordingly drivingR(eco), with 1 g of soil-emergentS. salsabiomass (dry weight) producing approximately 1.58 mg CO(2)per hour towardR(eco)during mid-summer. When water level was below the soil surface,R(s + r)was exponentially correlated to air temperature. BecauseR(eco)forS. salsamarsh in the Liaohe Delta is controlled by plant growth cycles, inundation regime, and air temperature, this finding may be applied for national carbon budget estimation purposes fromS. salsawetlands throughout Northeast China and potentially close a key gap in understanding the role of this large wetland area in contributing to respiratory CO(2)emissions globally.

AB Consecutive multiple disturbances to northern peatlands can dramatically impact peat hydrophysical properties. We examine the impact of a double disturbance (drainage and wildfire) on the hydrophysical and moisture retention properties of peat, a key regulator of peatland ecohydrological resilience, and compare this with the impact to each individual disturbance (drainage and wildfire). The compound effect of drainage and wildfire resulted in a shift of the surface datum down the peat profile, revealing denser peat. Less-dense near-surface peats that regulate water-table position and near-surface moisture content, both favourable to Sphagnum recolonization, were lost. At a drained peatland that was then subject to wildfire, peat bulk density increased by 14.1%, von Post humification class increased by two categories and water retention increased by 15.6%, compared with an adjacent burned but undrained (single disturbance) portion of the fen. We discuss the key hydrophysical metrics of peatland vulnerability and outline how they are affected by the isolated impacts of drainage and wildfire, as well as their combined effects. We demonstrate that multiple peatland disturbances have likely led to an increase in hydrological limitations to Sphagnum recovery, which may impact peatland ecohydrological resilience.

AB Peatlands harbour more than one-third of terrestrial carbon leading to the argument that the bryophytes, as major components of peatland ecosystems, store more organic carbon in soils than any other collective plant taxa. Plants of the genus Sphagnum are important components of peatland ecosystems and are potentially vulnerable to changing climatic conditions. However, the response of Sphagnum to rising temperatures, elevated CO2 and shifts in local hydrology have yet to be fully characterized. In this review, we examine Sphagnum biology and ecology and explore the role of this group of keystone species and its associated microbiome in carbon and nitrogen cycling using literature review and model simulations. Several issues are highlighted including the consequences of a variable environment on plant-microbiome interactions, uncertainty associated with CO2 diffusion resistances and the relationship between fixed N and that partitioned to the photosynthetic apparatus. We note that the Sphagnum fallax genome is currently being sequenced and outline potential applications of population-level genomics and corresponding plant photosynthesis and microbial metabolic modelling techniques. We highlight Sphagnum as a model organism to explore ecosystem response to a changing climate and to define the role that Sphagnum can play at the intersection of physiology, genetics and functional genomics.
   The response of Sphagnum (moss) and its associated microbiome to changing climatic conditions have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we use literature review and a coupled plant - microbe biochemical model to formalize our understanding of the physiological process that ultimately drive these commensal interactions and ecosystem function. We conclude that as dominate members of carbon rich peatland ecosystems, Sphagnum and its microbiome must to studied and integrated across a continuum of genomic to ecological scales.

AB Net accumulation rates of carbon in a 9000 calendar year record of Sphagnum fuscum peat in western boreal Canada range from 13.6 to 34.9 g . m(-2). yr(-1). The depth vs. age curve is slightly convex due to generally declining net productivity at the site. Fossil carbon/nitrogen ratios of bulk Sphagnum fuscum peat and its components are used to calculate the rate and total amount of decay in the deeper anoxic peat deposits. The proportional rate of decay in the catotelm of the peatland declines linearly over lime. Carbon loss from the catotelm is estimated at 50% after 1700 calendar years and 65% after 7500 calendar years. Carbon has been added to the catotelm at an average rate of 28.0 g . m(-1). yr(-1) over the last 1174 years, whereas, at present, the cumulative loss of carbon over the entire catotelm is 19.4 g . m(-2). yr(-1). The peatland continues to represent a sink for carbon.

AB Biomass and carbon accumulation into tree stand and distribution between tree stand components was studied in two undrained and four drained Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominated peatland stands in southern Finland. On the drained sites, the amount and distribution of biomass above-ground was rather similar to pine-dominated stands on upland sites when drainage age of the site was thought to represent the stand age. The proportion of estimated below-ground biomass of the total pine biomass was ca. 30% on all sites studied which is mon than on upland sites with supposedly similar growth potential. Due to the bigger amount of below-ground biomass, there is, on average, more biomass and thus also carbon in relation to stem volume in peatland stands than upland stands, when southern boreal Scots pine stands are examined. Equations for estimating the amount of carbon accumulating in the tree stand along with increasing stem volume are presented. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB 1. Abandoned cutover peatlands are persistent sources of atmospheric CO2. Net ecosystem CO2 exchange and Sphagnum net primary production of an abandoned block-cut bog were measured in the field and in the laboratory using gas exchange techniques to determine the processes controlling CO2 exchange in these ecosystems.
   2. Sphagnum net primary production was offset by peat respiration, resulting in the peatland becoming a net source of CO2 during the summer months.
   3. Sphagnum photosynthesis was greatest at wet sites. In addition, sites with vascular plant cover photosynthesized at approximately twice the rate of sites where vascular plants were removed.
   4. Laboratory results indicate that drying and wetting cycles negatively affect Sphagnum net primary production and net ecosystem CO2 exchange. Sphagnum and peat respiration increased 4-14-fold upon rewetting, whereas Sphagnum photosynthesis did not recover until 20 days of saturation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This research emphasizes the importance of stable moisture availability for the growth of Sphagnum and the eventual development of a new acrotelm on the cutover bog surface. Restoration techniques must therefore include companion species and a constant moisture supply above the minimum threshold for Sphagnum mosses.

AB Reactive iron and organic carbon are intimately associated in soils and sediments. However, to date, the organic compounds involved are uncharacterized on the molecular level. At redox interfaces in peatlands, where the biogeochemical cycles of iron and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are coupled, this issue can readily be studied. We found that precipitation of iron hydroxides at the oxic surface layer of two rewetted fens removed a large fraction of DOM via coagulation. On aeration of anoxic fen pore waters, >90% of dissolved iron and 27 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD) of dissolved organic carbon were rapidly (within 24 h) removed. Using ultra-high-resolution MS, we show that vascular plant-derived aromatic and pyrogenic compounds were preferentially retained, whereas the majority of carboxyl-rich aliphatic acids remained in solution. We propose that redox interfaces, which are ubiquitous in marine and terrestrial settings, are selective yet intermediate barriers that limit the flux of land-derived DOM to oceanic waters.

AB This study uses life-cycle analysis to examine the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Canadian peat industry for the period 1990-2000. GHG exchange is estimated for land-use change, peat extraction and processing, transport to market, and the in situ decomposition of extracted peat. The estimates, based on an additive GHG accounting model, show that the peat extraction life cycle emitted 0.54 X 10(6) t of GHG in 1990, increasing to 0.89 X 10(6) t in 2000 (expressed as CO2 equivalents using a 100-y time horizon). Peat decomposition associated with end use was the largest source of GHGs, comprising 71% of total emissions during this 11-y period. Land use change resulted in a switch of the peatlands from a GHG sink to a source and contributed an additional 15%. Peat transportation was responsible for 10% of total GHG emissions, and extraction and processing contributed 4%. It would take approximately 2000 y to restore the carbon pool to its original size if peatland restoration is successful and the cutover peatland once again becomes a net carbon sink.

AB This study examines the Holocene evolution of an inland subarctic permafrost peatland located on the north bank of Wiyashakimi Lake (Nunavik, northeastern Canada). The analysis of plant macrofossils allowed us to reconstruct the succession of the trophic conditions of a palsa and a filled thermokarst pond. The accumulation of organic matter began at around 6290 cal. y BP. The evolution of the site then followed three stages: a pond (6290-5790 cal. y BP), a minerotrophic peatland (5790-4350 cal. y BP) and an ombrotrophic peatland (from 4350 cal. y BP). The establishment of permafrost caused a palsa to form at around 170 cal. y BP, which corresponds to the coldest period of the Little Ice Age in northeastern Canada. A subsequent degradation of the palsa and the formation of a thermokarst pond were induced by the climate warming that began at the turn of the 20th century. The analysis of plant macrofossils from an adjacent filled thermokarst pond indicated three phases of development over a short 450-year period: subaquatic, minerotrophic, and ombrotrophic phases. When combined with previous studies of filled thermokarst ponds in northern Quebec, this result indicates that ponds are rapidly filling in with vegetation and acting as carbon sinks.

AB Fen peatlands cover a large proportion of the landscape in boreal Alberta and thus these ecosystems are likely to be constructed as part of mine closure following oil sands mining. Peatlands are large sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC); however, little is known about DOC dynamics in constructed peatlands. We investigated DOC production and its bioavailability from substrates collected from a constructed fen and natural fens (reference ecosystems) in the Athabasca oil sands region near Fort McMurray, Alberta. Dominant vegetation and other substrates used in fen construction, like peat, petroleum coke, tailings sand and upland soil, were collected for the study. The effect of substrate type, salinity and temperature on DOC production and bioavailability were analyzed in a laboratory incubation study. Sedges and trees produced the largest amount of DOC, followed by peat and moss in all the fens, whereas the substrates from the constructed fen such as petroleum coke, tailings sand and upland soil produced very little DOC per unit dry mass. In addition, temperature and salinity were also significant explanatory variables for both initial (30 day) and final (60 day) net DOC production rates. It was also observed that greater production of DOC resulted in lower pH and higher electrical conductivity (EC) in incubation jar water. In addition, the quality of DOC depended upon the type of substrate. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm wavelength (SUVA(254)) indicated that sedges produced DOC having less aromatic humic substances than peat, tailings sand, upland soil and petroleum coke. Substrate, salinity and temperature at which DOC was produced, and interactions among these factors were all found to significantly explain variation in DOC bioavailability. Aromatic content of DOC produced, based on SUVA(254), had an effect on its bioavailability. As various substrates produced different amounts and quality of DOC, and since construction material like petroleum coke and tailings sand produce very little DOC, it is likely that establishment of the vegetation community and its composition will play an important role in DOC dynamics at the constructed fen in the future.

AB Climate change is likely to significantly affect the hydrology, ecology, and ecosystem function of peatlands, with potentially important but unclear impacts on mercury mobility within and transport from peatlands. Using a full-factorial mesocosm approach, we investigated the potential impacts on mercury mobility of water table regime changes (high and low) and vegetation community shifts (sedge-dominated, Ericaceae-dominated, or unmanipulated control) in peat monoliths at the PEATcosm mesocosm facility in Houghton, Michigan. Lower and more variable water table regimes and the loss of Ericaceae shrubs act significantly and independently to increase both total Hg and methylmercury concentrations in peat pore water and in spring snowmelt runoff. These differences are related to enhanced peat decomposition and internal regeneration of electron acceptors which are more strongly related to water table regime than to plant community changes. Loss of Ericaceae shrubs and an increase in sedge cover may also affect Hg concentrations and mobility via oxygen shuttling and/or the provision of labile root exudates. Altered hydrological regimes and shifting vegetation communities, as a result of global climate change, are likely to enhance Hg transport from peatlands to downstream aquatic ecosystems.

AB Few studies provide experimental data to support the role of permafrost thaw on changes in arctic freshwater chemistry. We designed an incubation experiment to look at rapid nutrient release from permafrost soils and active layer soils under different warming scenarios, changes in redox environment, and microbial activity. Permafrost soil tended to immediately release more nutrients than active layer soils, especially under warmer conditions; suggesting the active layer is depleted in nutrients and the water column may be re-supplied with these ions from thawing permafrost. The release of micronutrients (Ca, Fe, Mg, S, Si) from incubated permafrost soils responded strongly to increased temperature; however, temperature alone was not necessarily the primary driver of macronutrient (N, P) release from permafrost. Other physicochemical parameters influenced by temperature, such as oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), microbial activity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Fe played an additional role in nutrient release from permafrost. These experiments suggest nutrient release via thaw of permafrost soils is able to contribute ample essential nutrients to arctic aquatic ecosystems, even within one day of warming. Further warming of the Arctic is likely to result in substantial changes to nutrient availability and cycling in these dominant habitats.

AB The temperature dependence of the methane oxidation rate is estimated. The methane lifetime in the atmosphere is shown to decrease by about 3% from 1900 to 2005. The overwhelming fraction of the total methane content is removed from the atmosphere at intratropical latitudes during the daytime. The methane oxidation rate growth due to the temperature increase in the troposphere generates negative feedback in the methane cycle and, accordingly, climatic feedback with the same sign. According to the estimates performed, the halt in methane concentration growth in the atmosphere observed in recent years can be associated with a decrease in the lifetime of methane in the atmosphere. According to the results of numerical experiments with the climatic model of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP RAS), the climatic effect of negative feedback of the tropospheric temperature and the methane lifetime in the atmosphere is not large and is comparable with the climatic forcing of the methane emission growth from bog ecosystems.

ID DYNAMICS; BOG; FEEDBACK; CO2
AB Localized ecohydrological feedbacks have been proposed as important internal drivers of patterns and processes in terrestrial ecosystems. However, there is a significant gap between the prominence of theoretical models and the paucity of observations describing linkages between ecosystem structure and functioning. Here we report empirical evidence for strong interactions between surface vegetation patterning and long-term carbon sequestration rates in four peat bogs in Patagonia on the basis of high-resolution stratigraphic analyses. Peatland development across the study region was characterized by repeated switches between wet-and dry-adapted plant communities, depicting changes between hollows (wet assemblages) and lawns (dry assemblages) that could represent past surface patterning. We found a site-specific relationship between the frequency of the wet-to-dry cycles and carbon accumulation rates that followed a power function, with rapid vegetation shifts causing high peat accumulation rates. Our results show strong evidence for internal regulation of vegetation dynamics and peatland growth, implying that understanding peatland processes is a prerequisite for peat-based paleoclimate reconstructions.

AB Land-use and climate change are expected to cause drying of vegetation and surface soils in continental boreal peatlands. We examined the effects of multi-decadal drying and drainage on plant community structure and productivity in four fens located in Alberta, Canada. Long-term drying resulted in a two to fourfold increase in total biomass in three of the four fen sites, with a similar large increase in NPP in Treed Fen 1. The treed poor fens consistently had decreased moss cover and productivity with drainage. Across all sites, changes in understory community composition were related to the change in water table position as well as overstory canopy development that occurred post-drainage. Overall, drainage induced a shift toward a drier peatland regime, favoring increased canopy and vascular plant density at the expense of ground-layer mosses or the understory. Within the ground layer communities, drainage favored dry-adapted hummock moss and lichen species over those wet-adapted but dessication-prone species typical of low-lying lawns and hollows. Alteration of fen vegetation due to ecosystem drying will not only influence carbon sequestration but also will increase the vulnerability of peatlands to wildfire, increasing the risk of further ecosystem degradation and possible loss of resilience.

AB Research on peatland C cycling has generally ignored refixation, i.e., the photosynthetic fixation of soil-produced or respired CO2. We quantified refixation in a boreal bog by transplanting groups of living nonradioactive Sphagnum fuscum (5 cm length, 4 cm diameter) into N-, P-, and S-fertilized field plots that had been radioactively labeled by exposure to (CO2)-C-14, and analyzing transplants retrieved at 2, 30, and 90 days post-labeling for C-14 activity. Sphagnum transplanted into plots that received both N and S had greater refixed C-14 activities (Bq g(-1)) than control plot transplants. Sphagnum capitulum (top 1 cm), 1-2 cm, and 2-5 cm sections behaved similarly with the capitula having the highest refuted C-14 activity and the 2-5 cm section having the lowest; differences between sections became more accentuated over time. Extrapolated to a m(2) basis, transplanted Sphagnum refixed 3.5-5.4% of the total C-14 initially incorporated into the living vegetation and top 10 cm of peat during labeling. Refixation may be an important pathway for C cycling within peatlands, potentially capturing significant proportions of peat-produced or respired CO2 before it escapes to the atmosphere.

AB Northern peatlands and permafrost soils are associated with large carbon stocks. Rising temperatures are likely to affect the carbon balance in high-latitude ecosystems, but to what degree is uncertain. We have enhanced the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model by introducing processes necessary to simulate permafrost dynamics, peatland hydrology, and peatland vegetation. The new version, LPJ-WHy v1.2, was used to study soil temperature, active layer depth, permafrost distribution, and water table position. Modeled soil temperatures agreed well with observations, apart from a Siberian site where the soil is insulated by an extensive shrub layer. Water table positions were generally in the range of observations, with some exceptions. Simulated active layer depth showed a mean absolute error of 44 cm when compared to observations, but the error was reduced to 25 cm when the soil type for seven sites was manually corrected to mirror local conditions. A sensitivity test, in which temperature and precipitation were varied independently, showed that soil temperatures and active layer depths increased more under higher temperatures when precipitation was increased at the same time. The sensitivity experiment suggested persisting wet conditions in peatlands even under temperature increases of up to 9 degrees C as long as annual precipitation is allowed to increase with temperature to the extent indicated by climate model experiments.

AB A new database of fire activity in Russia derived from I-km resolution remote sensing imagery is presented and discussed. The procedure used to generate this burned-area product is described, including active-fire detection and burn-scar mapping approaches. Fire detection makes use of a probabilistic procedure using image data from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) system. Using the combination of AVHRR data collected at the Krasnoyarsk, Russia, high-resolution picture transmission (HRPT) receiving station, and data from the NOAA Satellite Active Archive (SAA), fire maps are being created for all of Russia for 1995 to 1997 and all of Eastern Russia (east of the Ural Mountains) for 1995 to 2002. This mapping effort has resulted in the most complete set of historic fire maps available for Russia. An initial validation indicates that the burned-area estimates are conservative because the approaches do not detect smaller fires, and, in many cases, fire areas are slightly underestimated. Analyses using the fire database showed that an average of 7.7 x 10(6) ha yr(-1) of fire occurred in Eastern Russia between 1996 and 2002 and that fire was widely dispersed in different regions. The satellite-based burned-area estimates area were two to five times greater than those contained in official government burned-area statistics. The data show that there is significant interannual variability in area burned, ranging between a low of 1.5 x 10(6) ha in 1997 to a high of 12.1 x 10(6) ha in 2002. Seasonal patterns of fire are similar to patterns seen in the North American boreal region, with large-fire seasons experiencing more late-season burning (in August and September) than during low-fire years. There was a distinct zonal distribution of fires in Russia; 65% of the area burned occurred in the taiga zone, which includes southern, middle, and northern taiga subzones, 20% in the steppe and forest steppe zones, 12% in the mixed forest zone, and 3% in the tundra and forest-tundra zones. Lands classified as forest experienced 55% of all burned area, while crops and pastures, swamps and bogs, and grass and shrubs land cover categories experienced 13% to 15% each. Finally, the utility of the products is discussed in the context of fire management and carbon cycling. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The oxidative ratio (OR) of the organic matter of the terrestrial biosphere is a key parameter in the understanding of the magnitude of the carbon sink represented both by the terrestrial biosphere and by the global oceans. However, no study has considered the oxidation state of all the organic pools and fluxes within one environment. In this study all organic matter pathways (dissolved organic matter, particulate organic matter, CO2, and CH4) were measured within an upland peat ecosystem in northern England. The study showed the following: (1) The peat soil of ecosystem was accumulating oxygen at a rate of between -16 and -73t O km(-2)yr(-1); (2) Although there was no significant variation in oxidation state in the peat profile, there was a significant increase in degree of unsaturation with depth; (3) The dissolved organic matter leaving the ecosystem was significantly more oxidized than the other carbon pools analyzed while the particulate organic matter was not significantly different from the peat soil profile; and (4) Assuming that all carbon flux from the site was as CO2, the OR of the ecosystem was 1.07; when the nature and speciation of the release pathways were considered, the ecosystem OR was 1.04. At the global scale, correcting for the speciation of carbon fluxes means that the annual global fluxes of carbon to land=1.490.003Gt C/yr and to the oceans=2.010.004Gt C/yr.

AB Possible interactions between soil enzymes and the biogeochemistry of wetlands were investigated during a field-based drought simulation. Under control (waterlogged) conditions, correlations were found between the activity of the enzyme B-glucosidase and two properties associated with carbon cycling, namely i) CH4 release (r = 0.79, p < 0.01) and )dissolved organic carbon concentration (r = -0.81, p < 0.01). In contrast, the transition to drought conditions resulted in correlations between a-glucosidase activity and certain mineralisation processes, namely the release of mg and Ca (r = 0.72, p < 0.05). Sulphatase activity correlated with changes in sulphate concentration during the drought simulation (r = 0.73, p < 0.05). Further support for the suggested enzymic involvement in biogeochemical processes was found in laboratory studies. These experiments indicated that increasing the abundance of B-glucosidase could stimulate trace gas emissions (p < 0.001) and increase the concentration of magnesium and calcium (p < 0.05). Increased sulphatase abundance caused a suppression of methane emissions (p = 0.053).

AB Drought is likely to affect wetlands, including wetland soil microorganisms that drive soil biogeochemical cycling. Frequent drought could reduce the ability of wetlands to serve as sinks for global carbon or could eventually turn them into sources of atmospheric carbon in general and methane in particular. However, the response of microbial communities involved in methane production to drought remains unclear. The current study characterized archaeal communities of an alpine wetland in 2006, which was a drought year, and in 2007, which was not a drought year. A total of 12 soil samples (two years x two plant communities x three samples per plant community) were collected under two plant communities (dominated by Carex muliensis or Eleocharis valleculosa) at the Zoige wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Archaeal community size and structure were determined by qPCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphismanalysis of the 16S rRNA gene fragment, respectively. Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriales, uncultured Rice Cluster-II, and uncultured Crenarchaeota were detected. Ordination analysis indicated that archaeal community composition was strongly related to vegetation type and drought. The archaeal community was 10-times smaller in the drought year than in the non-drought year. The results indicated that drought may influence both archaeal community size and structure.

AB Biotechnological techniques, including biofilters and biotrickling filters are increasingly used to treat air polluted with VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). In this work, the start-up, the effect of the gaseous ammonia addition on the toluene removal rate, and the problems of the heat accumulation on the performance of a laboratory scale biofilter were studied. The packing material was sterilized peat enriched with a mineral medium and inoculated with an adapted consortium (two yeast and five bacteria). Start-up showed a short adaptation period and an increased toluene elimination capacity (EC) up to a maximum of 190 g/m(3)/h. This was related to increased CO, outlet concentration and temperature gradients between the packed bed and the inlet (Tm-Tin). These events were associated with the growth of the microbial population. The biofilter EC decreased thereafter, to attain a steady state of 8 g/m(3)/h. At this point, gaseous ammonia was added. EC increased up to 80 g/m(3)/h, with simultaneous increases on the CO, concentration and (Tm-Tin). Two weeks after the ammonia addition, the new steady state was 30 g/m(3)/h. In a second ammonia addition, the maximum EC attained was 40 g/m(3)/h, and the biofilter was in steady state at 25 g/m(3)/h. Carbon, heat, and water balances were made through 88 d of biofilter operation. Emitted CO2 was about 44.5% of the theoretical value relative to the total toluene oxidation, but accumulated carbon was found as biomass, easily biodegradable material, and carbonates. Heat and water balances showed strong variations depending on EC. For 88 d the total metabolic heat was -181.2 x 10(3) Kcal/m(3), and water evaporation was found to be 56.5 kg/m(3). Evidence of nitrogen limitation, drying, and heterogeneities were found in this study. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Microbial enzyme activities were followed during a field-based experimental simulation of the effects of higher rainfall in a Welsh peat land. The treatment did not significantly affect the activities of the carbon cycling enzymes, P-glucosidase, esterase or xylosidase. In contrast, the activity of the enzyme sulphatase decreased by 44% (P < 0.001) in response to the wetter conditions. The manipulation suggests that should climate change cause conditions to become wetter in peatlands, then (with the exception of sulphatase) current levels of wetness may be sufficient to limit decomposition processes, and thus any further increase in wetness is unlikely to induce a further decrease in decomposition rates. Correlations were found between the esterase activity and both nitrous oxide flux (r=-0.34, P<0.05), and methane release (r=0.53, P<0.01). Likewise, there was a correlation between xylosidase activity and both carbon dioxide emission (r=0.52, P<0.01) and aluminium concentration (r=0.58, P<0.01). All of the enzymes correlated positively with dissolved organic carbon (range r=0.53, P<0.01 sulphatase to r=0.61, P<0.001 glucosidase). Together, the correlations lend support to recent hypotheses suggesting that enzymes exert an influence over wetland biogeochemical properties.

AB As part of a study investigating the carbon balance of a blanket bog, we made an assessment of the spatial variation of radiocarbon concentrations in the surface layers of a small area of peatland in the north of England. The peat depth at which bomb-C-14 content was the highest varied considerably between cores sampled from across the site. At several sampling locations, C-14 levels >100% Modern were confined to the surface 8 cm, whereas bomb C-14 was evident at 1 site, located only meters away, to a depth of at least 12-16 cm. Using the layer where C-14 levels first exceeded 100% Modern as a chronological reference layer, we estimated the carbon accumulation rate over the last 50 yr for the surface peat at each site (range similar to 20 to similar to 125 g C m(2) yr(-1)). Our results show that although carbon accumulation over the last 50 yr was similar across the site, variation in the depth to which bomb C-14 was evident implied considerable variation in the vertical peat growth rate.

AB As the global climate changes so will the balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration and release from peatlands. The changes occurring within peatlands will be complex, making their future carbon (C) responses difficult to predict. We studied three boreal fen peatlands along a nutrient gradient in northern Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we investigated how abiotic and biotic responses of the fens interacted with seasonal and annual hydrologic variability. We further assessed the role that a local disturbance, such as inundation due to beaver dams, has in confounding fen C dynamics. We conducted these assessments by applying the process-based model Wetland-DNDC, which we parameterized, calibrated and corroborated with field data, to examine how C dynamics were affected by fen type (rich, intermediate and poor), historical and projected climate and local flooding disturbance. We found inter-annual variability in greenhouse gas (CO2 and methane, CH4) dynamics to be large among fens, with larger coefficients of variation for heterotrophic respiration and CH4 effluxes (a range of 40-85% and 31-58%, respectively) than gross primary production (a range of 9-26%). This annual variability in C effluxes correlated to meteorological conditions and water table, although the specific drivers differed among fens. Scenarios of prolonged flooding and drought had opposite effects on C effluxes. Drought increased CO2 efflux by 43%, 175% and 65% for rich, intermediate and poor fens, respectively, and decreased CH4 efflux by 11% and 14% for the intermediate and poor, but increased CH4 efflux by 19% for the rich fen. In contrast, shallow flooding decreased CO2 by 40%, 72% and 57% in the rich, intermediate and poor fen, and increased CH4 effluxes by 87%, 202% and 269%, respectively. Flooding by beaver dams during a prolonged drought moderately decreased CO2 (29%, 66% and 53%) but strongly increased CH4 efflux by 121%, 261% and 333%, respectively, than the flooding only. We conclude that the interacting controls on greenhouse gas dynamics differ among fens types, contributing to the magnitude of effluxes and their response to changing conditions. We propose that effects of water table level, peat nutrient status, and vegetation composition, and their interactions, on C processes require enhanced understanding to define natural ranges of spatial and temporal variability. Only then will it be possible to adequately predict future peatland C responses to climate and other environmental changes. As such, short-term experimental results or field studies should not be used to predict future peatland C dynamics without an understanding of the natural range of variation in the environmental drivers and the response of C processes to those drivers.

AB Although northern peatlands represent a globally significant reservoir for carbon, considerable uncertainty exists concerning solute transport systems within large (>1000 km(2)) peat deposits. We therefore delineated geochemical gradients linked to groundwater recharge and discharge along a 6 km transect within the 1200 km(2) Red Lake Peatland of northwestern Minnesota. We used ratios of Ca/Mg and Sr-87/Sr-86 to distinguish discharge of calcareous groundwater (similar to 1.4 and 0.7155, respectively) to the peat land from the mineral substratum along a topographic gradient from a bog crest downslope to an internal fen water track and bog islands. In contrast, the stable isotopes of the porewaters (delta O-18 from -12.8 parts per thousand to -7.8 parts per thousand) show that the active pore-spaces in these peat profiles have been flushed by recharge from the near-surface peat. We hypothesize that back-diffusion of groundwater-derived solutes from the peat matrix to active pore-spaces has allowed the geochemical signal from paleo-hydrogeologic discharge to persist into the current regime of dilute recharge. This effect has not been observed previously on the landform-scale and has important implications for carbon cycling in peatlands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes a method for assessing the probability that land management interventions will lead to an improvement in the carbon sink represented by peat soils. The method is able to. combine studies of different carbon uptake and release pathways in order to assess changes on the overall carbon or greenhouse gas budget, calculate the probability of the management or restoration leading to an improvement in the budget; calculate the uncertainty in that probability estimate; estimate the equivalent number of complete budgets available from the combination of the literature; test the difference in the outcome of different land management interventions; and provide a method for updating the predicted probabilities as new studies become available Using this methodology, this study considered the impact of: afforestation, managed burning, drainage, drain-blocking, grazing removal; and revegetation. on the carbon budget of peat soils in the UK. The study showed that afforestation, drain-blocking, revegetation, grazing removal and cessation of managed burning would bring a carbon benefit, whereas deforestation, managed burning and drainage would bring a disbenefit.
   The predicted probabilities of a benefit are often equivocal as each management type or restoration often leads to increase in uptake in one pathway while increasing losses in another. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Bog peat soils have been accumulating at Wellington Plain peatland, Victoria, Australia for the last 3300 years. Now, dried peat soils are common adjacent to bog peats. The 14C basal age of dried peat is not different from the 14C basal age of bog peat, which supports the theory that dried peat formed from bog peat. A novel application of 210Pb dating links the timing of this change with the introduction of livestock to Wellington Plain in the mid-1800s. Physical loss of material appears to have been the dominant process removing material as bog peats drained to form dried peats, as indicated by the mass balances of carbon and lead. This research has implications for the post-fire and post-grazing restoration of bogs in Victoria's Alpine National Park, and the contribution of peat soils to Australia's carbon emissions.

AB Reclamation of sites affected by oil sands mining in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) targets the construction of new fen watersheds, which are dominant wetland types in the region. The aquifers of slopes that supply water to the fen watershed are formed with tailings sands containing residual oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) contaminants, whose effects on peat microbial community function are poorly explored. To understand the effect of potential OSPW contamination on microbial communities typical to the range of peatlands in the AOSR, we measured microbial functional characteristics (overall substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and catabolic evenness) and tested the effect of short-term in-vitro exposure to OSPW in peat samples from three representative fen types (treed rich fen, poor fen, and hypersaline fen) within the AOSR at the start (early May) and middle (late June) of the growing season. Overall, our results suggest that short-term exposure to OSPW has negligible impact on peat aerobic microbial activity, and that time of growing season and site physicochemical characteristics are the primary control on microbial potential activity. Further studies are necessary to assess the effects of OSPW contaminants on microbial-driven processes in the medium and long terms, under anaerobic conditions, which dominate in peatlands.

AB The Late Glacial and Holocene climate of the western North Pacific is less studied than that of the eastern North Pacific. While it is well known that strong east-west gradients in the tropical Pacific Ocean influence terrestrial climate, we seek to better understand how these gradients are expressed in the northern extratropics. Toward this aim, we present an organic and stable isotope geochemical and macrofossil record from a peatland on the east coast of the Kamchatka peninsula. We find that both the early and late Holocene were wetter, with a different assemblage of plants from the middle Holocene, which was drier, with more episodic precipitation. The large ecohydrological changes at several points during the Holocene are contemporaneous with and of the same sense as those we find at places to the east, such as south-central Alaska and to the south, in northern Japan. We also find that the middle Holocene period of warmth, dryness and low carbon accumulation occur contemporaneously with an enhanced east-west gradient in tropical Pacific sea surface temperature. This suggests that that hydroclimatic conditions in the subarctic can be influenced by tropical dynamics.

AB Climate change scenarios suggest that northern peatlands could become drier. To address the type and magnitude of vegetation change associated with persistent drying, we studied changes in biomass and leaf area index following drainage 85 years previously of a bog, using destructive sampling, allometric relationships, and optical measurements. Our results show a 10-fold increase in aboveground biomass between the reference site and the most severely drained site, resulting from the growth of a tree layer. The total leaf biomass increased slightly as a result of drainage, thus an increase in woody biomass was the main cause of the increase in aboveground biomass. Leaf area index approximately tripled in sites where trees grew. Sphagnum L. moss biomass decreased from 120 g.m(-2) at the reference site (20% of all aboveground biomass) to 8 g.m(-2) under the tree canopy (<1% of all aboveground biomass). The percentage of deciduous shrubs increased from 3% of the total shrub biomass in the reference site to 72% in the most severely drained site. Our results show that lowering the water table of a bog can have a profound effect on vegetation but the net effect of these changes on the role of the peatland as a carbon sink remains difficult to assess.

AB River water quality is strongly influenced by their sediments and their associated pollutants. To assess the toxic potential of sediments, sediment toxicity tests require reliable control sediments, potentially including formulated control sediments as one major option. Although some standardization has been carried out, one critical issue still remains the quality of sediment organic matter (SOM). Organic carbon not only binds hydrophobic contaminants, but may be a source of mild toxicity, even if the SOM is essentially uncontaminated. We tested two different sources of organic carbon and the mixture of both (Sphagnum peat (P) and one commercial humic substances preparation-HuminFeed(A (R)), HF) in terms of life trait variables and expression profiles of selected life performance and stress genes of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In synchronous cultures, gene expression profiling was done after 6 and 48 h, respectively. The uncontaminated Sphagnum P reduced growth, but increased numbers of offspring, whereas HF did not significantly alter life trait variables. The 6 h expression profile showed most of the studied stress genes repressed, except for slight to strong induction in cyp-35B1 (all exposures), gst-38 (only mixture), and small hsp-16 genes (all exposures). After 48 h, the expression of almost all studied genes increased, particularly genes coding for antioxidative defense, multiple xenobiotic resistance, vitellogenin-like proteins, and genes regulating lifespan. Overall, even essentially uncontaminated SOM may induce several modes of action on the molecular level in C. elegans which may lead to false results if testing synthetic xenobiotics. This contribution is a plea for a strict standardization of the SOM quality in formulated sediments and to check for corresponding effects in other model sediment organisms, especially if using molecular toxicity endpoints.

AB 1 The recent vegetation dynamics of 16 ombrotrophic mires in southern Quebec (Canada) was studied through palaeoecological (dendrochronology, plant macrofossil and pollen analyses) and historical (aerial photograph analyses) techniques.
   2 Plant macrofossil analyses show that prior to European colonization (c. 1800), mires were predominately open environments dominated by Sphagnum mosses. Many sites subsequently became forested with little or no Sphagnum.
   3 Aerial photograph analyses indicate that widespread forest expansion occurred in all mires between 1948 and 1995. The percentage of the total mire area occupied by forest increased from 22.5 to 56.5%, an overall gain of 137 ha of forest habitat.
   4 A dry climatic period during the first part of the 20th century, drainage resulting from human activities, and fire events, seem to be the main causal factors of vegetation changes.
   5 Forest expansion is expected to cause profound changes in bog ecosystems, such as altering hydrological conditions and organic accumulation processes, and to be detrimental to regional biodiversity and the carbon balance.
   6 Overall, this study highlights the need to incorporate multiple approaches in reconstructing the vegetation dynamics of an ecosystem, and in determining causal factors of vegetation change.

AB We studied organic matter accumulation dynamics in peatland surface soil, using the root collar depth of tree-ring aged Scots pine seedlings for dating the base level of quantitative soil samples. The data consisted of 222 samples collected from 47 forestry-drained and four undrained locations. At the drained sites, the data indicated an average dry biomass accumulation of about 4 kg m(-2) in samples representing the past 30 years. Despite great variance in the data, the results clearly indicate decreasing per annum accumulation values with increasing sample age, thus implying rapid decomposition of the fresh litter. Derived from the age-mass relationship we can estimate that about 95% of 1 year's litter input will be decomposed during 30 years. High decomposition rate of the litter suggests that drained peatland forest soils do not act as a carbon sink. The average detritus accumulation values were somewhat higher on the undrained control sites than on the drained sites. Among the forestry-drained sites, the average accumulation was significantly lower in sites with timber volumes exceeding 200 m(3) ha(-1), as compared with sites with timber volumes <100 m(3) ha(-1), suggesting a connection between tree stock and litter decomposition rate.

AB This review highlights the ubiquity of black carbon (BC) produced by incomplete combustion of plant material and fossil fuels in peats, soils, and lacustrine and marine sediments. We examine various definitions and analytical approaches and seek to provide a common language. BC represents a continuum from partly charred material to graphite and soot particles, with no general agreement on clear-cut boundaries. Formation of BC can occur in two fundamentally different ways. Volatiles recondense to highly graphitized soot-BC, whereas the solid residues form char-BC. Both forms of BC are relatively inert and are distributed globally by water and wind via fluvial and atmospheric transport. We summarize, chronologically, the ubiquity of BC in soils and sediments since Devonian times, differentiating between BC from vegetation fires and from fossil fuel combustion. BC has important implications for various biological, geochemical and environmental processes. As examples, BC may represent a significant sink in the global carbon cycle, affect the Earth's radiative heat balance, be a useful tracer for Earth's fire history, build up a significant fraction of carbon buried in soils and sediments, and carry organic pollutants. On land, BC seems to be abundant in dark-colored soils, affected by frequent vegetation burning and fossil fuel combustion, thus probably contributing to the highly stable aromatic components of soil organic matter. We discuss challenges for future research. Despite the great importance of BC, only limited progress has been made in calibrating analytical techniques. Progress in the quantification of BC is likely to come from systematic intercomparison using BCs from different sources and in different natural matrices. BC identification could benefit from isotopic and spectroscopic techniques applied at the bulk and molecular levels. The key to estimating BC stocks in soils and sediments is an understanding of the processes involved in BC degradation on a molecular level. A promising approach would be the combination of short-term laboratory experiments and long-term field trials.

AB Upland peat soils represent a large terrestrial carbon store and as such have the potential to be either an ongoing net sink of carbon or a significant net source of carbon. In the UK many upland peats are managed for a range of purposes but these purposes have rarely included carbon stewardship. However, there is now an opportunity to consider whether management practices could be altered to enhance storage of carbon in upland peats. Further. there are now voluntary and regulated carbon trading schemes operational throughout Europe that mean stored carbon, if verified, could have an economic and tradeable value. This means that new income streams could become available for upland management. The 'Sustainable Uplands' RELU project has developed a model for calculating carbon fluxes from peat soils that covers all carbon uptake and release pathways (e.g. fluvial and gaseous pathways). The model has been developed so that the impact of common management options within UK upland peats can be considered. The model was run for a decade from 1997-2006 and applied to an area of 550 km(2) of upland peat soils in the Peak District. The study estimates that the region is presently a net sink of - 62 ktonnes CO2 equivalent at an average export of - 136 tonnes CO2 equivalent/km(2)/yr. If management interventions were targeted across the area the total sink could increase to - 160 ktonnes CO2/yr at an average export of - 219 tonnes CO2 equivalent/km(2)/yr. However, not all interventions resulted in a benefit; some resulted in increased losses Of CO2 equivalents. Given present costs of peatland restoration and value of carbon offsets, the study suggests that 51% of those areas, where a carbon benefit was estimated by modelling for targeted action of management interventions, would show a profit from carbon offsetting within 30 years. However, this percentage is very dependent upon the price of carbon used. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Over half of the world's peat originated from Sphagnum, representing 10-15% of the terrestrial carbon stock. However, information regarding the release and exudation of organic carbon by living Sphagnum plants into the surface peat is scarce. In this study, we examined the contribution of recent Sphagnum subnitens (Russ. and Warnst.) photosynthate carbon to the peatland dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. This was done using a (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase experimental approach during the growing season. Despite the importance of Sphagnum in long-term carbon accumulation, results showed that the Sphagnum community rapidly contributes recently synthesized carbon to the peatland DOC pool. We estimate that by 4 h up to 4% of the total DOC in peat leachate was derived from (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling at ambient CO2 concentrations. Nonetheless, a huge 64% of the C-13 initially assimilated by photosynthesis was retained in Sphagnum subnitens for 23 days after labelling, consistent with the role of Sphagnum in peatland carbon accumulation. The majority of C-13 loss as respired CO2 came within the few days post (CO2)-C-13 labelling, suggesting that it was derived from plant respiration of photosynthates.

AB Microbes involved in decomposition within peatlands and the conditions that influence their activities have implications for C and greenhouse gas exchange. The objectives of this research were to characterize the role of fungal and bacterial activities in peatlands using selective antibiotic inhibition techniques across a nutrient gradient (rich to poor fens) and to search for environmental controls on the activity of each group. Bacterial activities predominated across a range of rich to poor boreal peatlands in central Ontario, Canada, although fungal activity became increasingly important in the poor sites. Linkages between soil pH and nutrient status and fungal and bacterial activities were found. However, they did not confirm our initial hypotheses that bacterial activity would be low in poor sites due to proton stress and low nutrient (particularly N) availability, whereas, fungal activity would be low in rich sites due to increased competitive ability of bacteria under near neutral pH conditions and high nutrient availability. Further work across these sites aimed at characterizing the phylogeny of the rhizosphere fungi is needed to determine if increased presence of mycorrhizae in poor sites could have explained our observed patterns. However, regardless of fungal: bacterial activity ratio differences across sites and its associated controls, microbial CO2 production rates across fen types did not vary significantly, suggesting that the proportion of bacteria and fungi may not matter to broader carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in peat soils.

AB Peatland carbon and water cycling are tightly coupled, so dynamic modeling of peat accumulation over decades to millennia should account for carbon-water feedbacks. We present initial results from a new simulation model of long-term peat accumulation, evaluated at a wellstudied temperate bog in Ontario, Canada. The Holocene Peat Model (HPM) determines vegetation community composition dynamics and annual net primary productivity based on peat depth (as a proxy for nutrients and acidity) and water table depth. Annual peat (carbon) accumulation is the net balance above-and below-ground productivity and litter/peat decomposition -a function of peat hydrology (controlling depth to and degree of anoxia). Peat bulk density is simulated as a function of degree of humification, and affects the water balance through its influence on both the growth rate of the peat column and on peat hydraulic conductivity and the capacity to shed water. HPM output includes both time series of annual carbon and water fluxes, peat height, and water table depth, as well as a final peat profile that can be "cored" and compared to field observations of peat age and macrofossil composition. A stochastic 8500-yr, annual precipitation time series was constrained by a published Holocene climate reconstruction for southern Qu ' ebec. HPM simulated 5.4m of peat accumulation (310 kg Cm-2) over 8500 years, 6.5% of total NPP over the period. Vascular plant functional types accounted for 65% of total NPP over 8500 years but only 35% of the final (contemporary) peat mass. Simulated age-depth and carbon accumulation profiles were compared to a radiocarbon dated 5.8 m, c. 9000-yr core. The simulated core was younger than observations at most depths, but had a similar overall trajectory; carbon accumulation rates were generally higher in the simulation and were somewhat more variable than observations. HPM results were sensitive to centuryscale anomalies in precipitation, with extended drier periods (precipitation reduced similar to 10%) causing the peat profile to lose carbon (and height), despite relatively small changes in NPP.

AB Radiocarbon (C-14) is a key tracer for detecting the mobilization of previously stored terrestrial organic carbon (C) into aquatic systems. Old C (>1,000years BP) may be masked by postbomb C (fixed from the atmosphere post-1950 CE), potentially rendering bulk aquatic dissolved organic C (DOC) C-14 measurements insensitive to old C. We collected DOC with a modern C-14 signature from a temperate Scottish peatland stream and decomposed it to produce CO2 under simulated natural conditions over 140days. We measured the C-14 of both DOC and CO2 at seven time points and found that while DOC remained close to modern in age, the resultant CO2 progressively increased in age up to 2,356767years BP. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the bulk (DOC)-C-14 pool can hide the presence of old C within peatland stream DOC export, demonstrating that bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements can be an insensitive indicator of peatland disturbance. Our experiment also demonstrates that this old C component is biologically and photochemically available for conversion to the greenhouse gas CO2, and as such, bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements do not reflect the C-14 signature of the labile organic C pool exported by inland water systems more broadly. Moreover, our experiment suggests that old C may be an important component of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from peatland aquatic systems, with implications for tracing and modeling interactions between the hydrological and terrestrial C cycles.
   Plain Language Summary The introduction of old carbon previously stored in soils for thousands of years into rivers can increase the net flux of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, impacting global climate. This is because rivers transport the equivalent of one third of human carbon emissions annually from land to the oceans. Much river-borne carbon is plant and soil (organic) matter that can decompose during transport, releasing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon dating can reveal the age of river-borne carbon, but previous measurements may have underestimated the age of carbon released into rivers by not considering the potential for old carbon hidden within individual bulk water samples. Using an incubation experiment, we demonstrate that dissolved organic carbon from a Scottish peatland stream that would be considered modern in age using traditional bulk radiocarbon dating can readily decompose to produce carbon dioxide with an old radiocarbon signature up to similar to 2,500years old. This demonstrates that radiocarbon dating of bulk riverine dissolved organic carbon can hide the presence of old carbon. Furthermore, these results indicate that old carbon may be more common in the global carbon cycle than previously thought, with important implications for our understanding and modeling of peatland ecosystems.

AB This study measures the complete carbon budget of a drained peat-covered catchment. It includes dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved CO(2), primary pro-ductivity, soil respiration of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane (CH(4)) in contrast to other studies which have focused on only some of the possible carbon uptake and release pathways; values for rainfall inputs were taken from a nearby catchment. The study is based on data collected over 2 yr for two drain catchments within one site and the main findings are:
   1. The catchments were a net source of all forms of carbon at between +63.8 and +106.8 Mg C/km2/yr;
   2. There was a net loss of between +9.3 and +40.7 Mg C/km2/yr in terms of exchange of carbon with the atmosphere;
   3. The small size of the study catchments seems to have resulted in higher values of exported DOC than recorded elsewhere and the highly disturbed drainage of the site may have given rise to losses in net ecosystem exchange (NEE).
   If the fate of the peatland carbon store is to be understood, then it is important that all carbon uptake and release pathways are considered and not just components of the carbon cycle.

AB Mass stabilization, a ground improvement solution used for construction in peatlands, involves mixing suitable dry binders into the peat, increasing strength and stiffness and reducing permeability. A previous pilot study of the carbonation process in stabilized peat showed that it could be a net sink of CO2, because the binder takes in CO2 from the atmosphere and any CO2 released by oxidized peat due to carbonation. In this study, a closed-chamber method was applied to stabilised peat specimens over a 6 month period to assess the factors affecting CO2 intake rate. The studies revealed that an increase in cement content and a larger surcharge contributed to a larger CO2 intake rate. These rates decreased logarithmically with time, and surcharge was found to be less influential over time. The CO2 intake rate reduced when the atmospheric CO2 concentration reduced, and the replacement of cement with ground granulated blast-furnace slag had a negative effect on the CO2 intake rate due to its lower carbonation potential. Furthermore, a high water table resulted in a decrease in the CO2 intake rate. These laboratory results have highlighted that dry soil mixing has a minimal on-site impact in environmental terms, allowing geotechnical engineers to make more informed decisions on the suitability of this technique for construction projects.

AB The peatlands of the Zoige Plateau are an important global carbon source that is currently under threat as a result of drainage for grazing. How drainage affects the microbial diversity and activity in peatlands is unclear. This study examined the response of microbial communities at two sites to short-term drainage (3 years) and long-term drainage (48 years) in combination with three different water table treatments. Our objective was to examine the changes in the physicochemical properties of the soil, composition of bacterial and fungal communities, and microbial activity. Our results indicated that (1) both duration of drainage and water table drawdown had significant effects on the diversity and composition of the bacterial and fungal communities in the soil, and certain bacteria were replaced by fungal decomposers; (2) duration of drainage affected the structure of fungal communities more than that of bacterial communities, and interactions between microbial species were more complex in peatlands with long-term drainage; (3) drainage significantly altered concentrations of dis solved inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N and NO3--N), and these changes correlated with structure of bacterial and fungal communities as well as with changes in abundance of certain dominant microbial species; and (4) fungal communities explained a larger part of microbial activity than bacterial communities. Overall, these findings suggest that fungi play a much more important role than bacteria in microbial-mediated ecosystem functioning in peatlands undergoing drainage.

AB Climate change sensitively concerns peatlands as ecosystems which represent significant stores of soil carbon globally. Differences in the carbon balance of peatlands seem to be long-term variations of carbon accumulation that appears in climate change but also it is particularly useful to study the short-term seasonal ecological function of small mires located in the frontier zone of Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs in the plains of Europe. The aim of the study is to provide a seasonal overview of functional physiological mechanisms of a unique and isolated peat moss dominated area in Hungary. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI values), chlorophyll fluorescence parameter (Fv/Fm) of dominant Sphagnum and vascular plant species were measured seasonally in two Hungarian Sphagnum dominated mires under in situ field conditions. NEE ranged from -1.08 to -2.89 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the spring and autumn but fell to 0.68 to -2.52 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (a negative value indicates ecosystem uptake) under higher light flux density (PPFD of 1100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) during the summer period. NDVI values showed the highest rates in summer (between 0.756-0.882) and the lowest rates were measured in spring (between 0.426-0.612) in all investigated microhabitats. The maximal photochemical activity (Fv/Fm) of the dominated species reflected the seasonal and microclimatic adaptation; showed lower values in spring and autumn (0.505-0.847) while these parameters are characterized by higher values (0.8-0.857) in all dominated species in summer. Our study shows that functional differences can also exist within relatively small mire not only seasonally but also depending on microsites or types of plant communities. These results contribute to our understanding of dynamic changes of peatlands, mire ecosystem functioning at the edge of their distribution and predict ecosystem responses to climate change, which can be potential factors both on global carbon cycle and global change.

AB Measurement of extracellular enzymic activity in wetland soils can give an indication of the ecosystems biogeochemical processes, and rates of nutrient and carbon cycling. Analysis of these have allowed researchers to gain an understanding of the ecosystems' microbial ecology and how it can be affected by environmental factors. Here we give a detailed description of the assays necessary to determine the activity of a suite of key hydrolase enzymes and phenol oxidases. These enzymes control the rates of decomposition and consequently the production of biogenic greenhouse gases. Knowing the processes responsible for the breakdown of organic matter is therefore essential if it becomes necessary to curb these emissions. Our protocols allow for cost effective analysis of a large number of samples and provide sufficient accuracy to determine differences between soil types. When coupled with contemporary microbial techniques these enzyme assays permit entire biochemical pathways to be determined, giving unparalleled knowledge on the processes involved in wetland ecosystems.

AB Climate change can alter peatland plant community composition by promoting the growth of vascular plants. How such vegetation change affects peatland carbon dynamics remains, however, unclear. In order to assess the effect of vegetation change on carbon uptake and release, we performed a vascular plant-removal experiment in two Sphagnum-dominated peatlands that represent contrasting stages of natural vegetation succession along a climatic gradient. Periodic measurements of net ecosystem CO2 exchange revealed that vascular plants play a crucial role in assuring the potential for net carbon uptake, particularly with a warmer climate. The presence of vascular plants, however, also increased ecosystem respiration, and by using the seasonal variation of respired CO2 radiocarbon (bomb-C-14) signature we demonstrate an enhanced heterotrophic decomposition of peat carbon due to rhizosphere priming. The observed rhizosphere priming of peat carbon decomposition was matched by more advanced humification of dissolved organic matter, which remained apparent beyond the plant growing season. Our results underline the relevance of rhizosphere priming in peatlands, especially when assessing the future carbon sink function of peatlands undergoing a shift in vegetation community composition in association with climate change.

AB Northern peatlands play a major role in the global carbon cycle as sinks for CO2 and as sources of CH4. These diverse ecosystems develop through accumulation of partially decomposed plant material as peat. With increasing depth, peat becomes more and more recalcitrant due to its longer exposure to decomposing processes. Compared with surface peat, deeper peat sediments remain microbiologically poorly described. We detected active archaeal communities even in the deep bottom layers (-220/-280 cm) of two Finnish fen-type peatlands by 16S rRNA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In the sediments of the northern study site, all detected archaea were methanogens with Rice Cluster II (RC-II) and Methanosaetaceae as major groups. In southern peatland, Crenarchaeota of a rare unidentified cluster were present together with mainly RC-II methanogens. RNA profiles showed a larger archaeal diversity than DNA-based community profiles, suggesting that small but active populations were better visualized with rRNA. In addition, potential methane production measurements indicated methanogenic activity throughout the vertical peat profiles.

AB Viruses impact microbial activity and carbon cycling in various environments, but their diversity and ecological importance in Sphagnum-peatlands are unknown. Abundances of viral particles and prokaryotes were monitored bi-monthly at a fen and a bog at two different layers of the peat surface. Viral particle abundance ranged from 1.7 x 10(6) to 5.6 x 10(8) particles mL(-1), and did not differ between fen and bog but showed seasonal fluctuations. These fluctuations were positively correlated with prokaryote abundance and dissolved organic carbon, and negatively correlated with water-table height and dissolved oxygen. Using shotgun metagenomics we observed a shift in viral diversity between winter/spring and summer/autumn, indicating a seasonal succession of viral communities, mainly driven by weather-related environmental changes. Based on the seasonal asynchrony between viral and microbial diversity, we hypothesize a seasonal shift in the active microbial communities associated with a shift from lysogenic to lytic lifestyles. Our results suggest that temporal variations of environmental conditions rather than current habitat differences control the dynamics of virus-host interactions in Sphagnum dominated peatlands.

AB Large areas of UK peatland were planted with non-native conifers in the twentieth century, changing many aspects of the ecosystem. As these plantations reach harvesting age there are important questions about what should be done with them next, with key options including restocking for continued forestry and restoration. Making decisions on the future of these sites is difficult and the underlying evidence base is often incomplete. In order to prioritise future evidence needs we conducted a two-phase consultation exercise to identify what a large body of stakeholders in science, policy and practice consider to be the most important outstanding research questions. The five most popular questions identified were: How does the greenhouse gas balance of peatland forestry differ between deep and shallow peat and compare to forestry on mineral soils?; How does the greenhouse gas budget of a peatland change with initial afforestation, restocking or restoration?; Is it possible to have trees on peat without loss of biodiversity and carbon storage?; What are the limits to the achievability of forest-to-bog restoration in terms of factors such as peat condition, depth and site extent?; and What is the financial value of natural capital in natural and afforested peatlands and how does this change with restoration? Notable subsidiary themes included flooding, biodiversity and compensatory planting. These questions form potential foci for future research and particularly emphasise the importance of understanding carbon cycling in afforested peatlands.

AB Background Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP)-forested peatlands are widespread ecosystems in boreal North America in which peat accumulation, known as the paludification process, has been shown to induce forest growth decline. The continuously evolving environmental conditions (e.g., water table rise, increasing peat thickness) in paludified forests may require tree growth mechanism adjustments over time. In this study, we investigate tree ecophysiological mechanisms along a paludification gradient in a boreal forested peatland of eastern Canada by combining peat-based and tree-ring analyses. Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes in tree rings are used to document changes in carbon assimilation rates, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency. In addition, paleohydrological analyses are performed to evaluate the dynamical ecophysiological adjustments of black spruce trees to site-specific water table variations. Results Increasing peat accumulation considerably impacts forest growth, but no significant differences in tree water use efficiency (iWUE) are found between the study sites. Tree-ring isotopic analysis indicates no iWUE decrease over the last 100 years, but rather an important increase at each site up to the 1980s, before iWUE stabilized. Surprisingly, inferred basal area increments do not reflect such trends. Therefore, iWUE variations do not reflect tree ecophysiological adjustments required by changes in growing conditions. Local water table variations induce no changes in ecophysiological mechanisms, but a synchronous shift in iWUE is observed at all sites in the mid-1980s. Conclusions Our study shows that paludification induces black spruce growth decline without altering tree water use efficiency in boreal forested peatlands. These findings highlight that failing to account for paludification-related carbon use and allocation could result in the overestimation of aboveground biomass production in paludified sites. Further research on carbon allocation strategies is of utmost importance to understand the carbon sink capacity of these widespread ecosystems in the context of climate change, and to make appropriate forest management decisions in the boreal biome.

AB Plant species shape soil properties such as nutrient availability and carbon storage through functional traits. Understanding the role of plant functional traits, and the relationship between aboveground and belowground systems are especially important in boreal peatlands, which are important carbon sinks. Sphagnum as a key peat-forming bryophyte has long been considered an ecosystem engineer, whereas the engineering role of graminoids, also dominant in peatlands, has not traditionally been considered.
   We quantified vegetation community composition, plant functional traits, and peat properties in two peatland sites differing in dominant vegetation (Sphagnum mosses and Carex sedges), and link plant traits with peat properties using ordination.
   We show that plant traits significantly explain many peat properties, including organochemicals that are indicators of decomposition dynamics. Specifically, Carex-dominated sites had larger amount of 'decomposition products' while a larger proportion of 'undecomposed materials' was observed in Sphagnum-dominated sites.
   Feedbacks in plant-soil systems are increasingly being recognised as drivers of ecosystem processes. In both peatland types, plant traits of the key ecosystem engineer drove properties of the belowground peat environment. Peat organochemical constituents between Sphagnum-dominated and Carex-dominated sites reveal differences in ecosystem function, and thus the conducive potential for carbon storage.

AB Dimethylsulfide (CH3SCH3) is formed in anoxic freshwater sediments by biological methylation of methanethiol (CH3SH). We measured thiol methylation potential in low-pH, Sphagnum peat sediments from Alaska and Alabama by adding ethanethiol (CH3CH2SH) to peat slurries and quantifying the rate of ethylmethylsulfide (CH3CH2SCH3) formation. Thiol methylation potential ranged from 12 to 154 nM h(-1) and was significantly related to dimethylsulfide accumulation rates (P=0.0007; r(2) =0.48). Addition of methanol or syringic acid stimulated thiol methylation potential and dimethylsulfide accumulation rate, suggesting that these compounds could be methyl donors. Addition of acetate or its metabolic precursors (glucose or Sphagnum plant material) inhibited thiol methylation potential, but not carbon dioxide or methane production. Inhibition of methanogenesis with either 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid or KNO3 consistently inhibited thiol methylation potential and dimethylsulfide accumulation. These results suggest that methanogens play a role in thiol methylation and therefore dimethylsulfide formation. (C) 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Changes in the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in arctic soils may influence the global carbon cycle and be an important feedback mechanism to global climate changes. In order to estimate the carbon stock and accumulation rates at Flakkerhuk on Disko Island in West Greenland, an 1800-ha study area was divided into land cover types using a satellite image. Total SOC was estimated to be on average 67.3 ton C ha(-1) (6.7 kg m(-2)) and the fen area contributing 42% of the total SOC. Soil profiles investigated at different terraces revealed that the SOC stock was significantly age-related, increasing six fold from a terrace dated to 7000 (BP) to 2 one dated to 10,000 (BP). This equals an average soil C accumulation rate of 0.5 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1). This rate was compared to vegetation-specific accumulation rates in the last 7000 yr which were in the order of 0.05 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1) in heath and sparse vegetation, 0.4 in fen areas and between 2 and 5 kg C m(-2) the last 100 yr in the present salt marsh. The study shows the importance of landscape history and age when sampling and evaluating SOC stocks and provides estimates of arctic soil C accumulation rates during Holocene versus present rates.

AB Global climate change has raised important questions about ecosystem resilience and the likelihood of unexpected and potentially irreversible ecosystem state shifts. Conceptual models provide a framework for generating hypotheses about long-term ecosystem processes and their responses to external perturbations. In this article, we review the classic model of autogenic peatland encroachment into closed-basin kettle lakes (terrestrialization) as well as studies that document patterns of terrestrialization that are inconsistent with this hypothesis. We then present a new conceptual model of episodic, drought-triggered terrestrialization, which is consistent with existing data and provides a mechanism by which climatic variability could cause non-linear patterns of peatland development in these ecosystems. Next, we review data from comparative studies of kettle lakes along a peatland-development gradient to explore potential ecological and biogeochemical consequences of non-linear patterns of terrestrialization. Finally, we identify research approaches that could be used to test conceptual models of terrestrialization, investigate the ecological implications of non-linear patterns of peatland development, and improve our ability to predict responses of kettle systems to climate changes of the coming decades and century.

AB Litter decomposition, a key process by which recently fixed carbon is lost from ecosystems, is a function of environmental conditions and plant community characteristics. In ice-rich peatlands, permafrost thaw introduces high variability in both abiotic and biotic factors, both of which may affect litter decomposition rates in different ways. Can the existing conceptual frameworks of litter decomposition and its controls be applied across a structurally heterogeneous thaw gradient? We investigated the variability in litter decomposition and its predictors at the Stordalen subarctic peatland in northern Sweden. We measured in situ decomposition of representative litter and environments using litter bags throughout two years. We found highly variable litter decomposition rates with turnover times ranging from five months to four years. Surface elevation was a strong correlate of litter decomposition across the landscape, likely as it integrates multiple environmental and plant community changes brought about by thaw. There was faster decomposition but also more mass remaining after two years in thawed areas relative to permafrost areas, suggesting faster initial loss of carbon but more storage into the slow-decomposing carbon pool. Our results highlight mechanisms and predictors of carbon cycle changes in ice-rich peatlands following permafrost thaw.

AB Estimates of the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes resulting from sheep grazing upon upland peat soils have never been fully quantified. Previous studies have been limited to individual flux pathways or to comparing the presence to the absence of sheep grazing. Therefore, this study combines a model of the physical impact of grazing with models of: biomass production; energy usage in sheep; and peat accumulation. These combined modelling approaches enabled this study to consider the indirect and direct impacts of sheep upon the carbon and greenhouse gas balance of a peatland at different grazing intensities as well as the changes between grazing intensities. The study considered four vegetation scenarios (Calluna sp., Molinia sp.; reseeded grasses, and Agrostis-Festuca grassland) and a mixed vegetation scenario based upon the vegetation typical of upland peat ecosystems in northern England. Each scenario was considered for altitudes between 350 and 900 m above sea level and for grazing intensities between 0.1 and 2 ewes/ha. The study can show that the total GHG flux at the vegetative carrying capacity tended to decline with increasing altitude for all vegetation scenarios considered except for Molinia sp. The average total GHG flux for all scenarios was 1505 kg CO(2)eq/ha/yr/(ewe/ha), and on average 89% of the fluxes were directly from the sheep and not from the soil, and are therefore not unique to a peat soil environment. The study suggests that emission factors for upland sheep have been greatly underestimated. By comparing the total flux due to grazers to the flux to or from the soil that allows the study to define a GHG carry capacity, i.e. the grazing intensity at which the flux due to grazing is equal to the sink represented by the peat soils, this GHG carrying capacity varies between 0.2 and 1.7 ewes/ha with this capacity declining with increasing altitude for all model scenarios.

AB Peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the most important contributors to carbon budgets in peatland systems. Many studies have investigated factors affecting DOC concentration in peatland systems, yet hillslope position has been thus far overlooked as a variable that could influence DOC cycling. This study investigates the importance of hillslope position with regard to DOC cycling. Two upland peat hillslopes were studied in the Peak District, UK, to determine what impact, if any, hillslope position had upon DOC concentration. Hillslope position was found to be a significant factor affecting variation in soil pore water DOC concentration, with bottom-slope positions having significantly lower DOC concentrations than up-slope because of dilution of DOC as water moves down-slope and is flushed out of the system via lateral throughflow. Water table drawdown on steeper mid-slopes increased DOC concentrations through increased DOC production and extended residence times allowing a build-up of humic-rich DOC compounds. Hillslope position did not significantly affect DOC concentrations in surface runoff water because of the dilution of near-surface soil pore water by precipitation inputs, while stream water had similar water chemistry properties to soil pore water under low-flow conditions.

AB The impact of climate change on the greenhouse gas balance of peatlands is debated as they function both as sinks of carbon and significant sources of methane. To study redox transformations influencing methane production, we incubated two intact soil monoliths from a northern temperate fen and compared a permanently wet treatment to a treatment undergoing an experimentally induced drought for 50 days. Net turnover of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), methane (CH4) and electron acceptors in the saturated zone was calculated using a mass balance approach, and sulfate gross reduction rates were determined using a S-35 radiotracer. Thermodynamic energy yield of different electron accepting processes was calculated and related to the observed respiration patterns. Permanently wet conditions lead to a depletion of electron acceptors within 50 days and onset of methanogenic conditions. During drought, electron acceptors were renewed and methanogenesis was temporarily suppressed in most of the peat for another 20-50 days after rewetting. Methanogenesis began, however, apparently locally before electron acceptors were fully depleted in the remainder of the peat, and iron and sulfate reduction occurred simultaneously. Anaerobic production of DIC could mostly but not fully be explained by reduction of nitrate, sulfate and ferric iron. Sulfate gross reduction rates of up to similar to 450 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) determined with S-35-SO4 and potentially explained the surplus of 50-60 mmol m(-2) of DIC production in one treatment; however, the sulfate pools were too small to sustain such rates beyond some hours to days. Furthermore, anaerobic DIC production proceeded at constant rates after depletion of dissolved inorganic electron acceptors, although not being balanced by methane production. An unknown electron acceptor was thus consumed, and sulfate and potentially other electron acceptors recycled, either by humic substances, by aerenchymatic oxygen transport, or by oxygen in the capillary fringe at low levels of air filled porosity.

AB Carbon dioxide fluxes and water balance were examined in 43 tundra ponds in the northern portion of the Hudson Bay Lowland near Churchill, Manitoba. Most of the ponds were hydrologically disconnected from their catchments during dry periods throughout the post-melt season. However, episodic reconnection occurred following large precipitation events where depression storage was exceeded. Significant shifts in pond chemistry were observed following precipitation events, with the degree of CO2 saturation increasing during these periods. Pond CO2 concentrations rapidly fell to pre-event levels following events, suggesting that hydrological connectivity can affect the magnitude and direction of CO2 gas fluxes in tundra ponds. Atmospheric CO2 invaded ponds with highly organic sediments for most of the summer, suggesting that terrestrially derived inorganic carbon was insufficient to meet the demands of algal net production. In contrast, ponds with highly mineral sediments continued to evade CO2 during the summer. In a subset of I I ponds, long-term rates of carbon accumulation in sediment ranged from 0.6 to 2.2 mol C m(-2) year(-1). Very strong correlations existed between average sediment accumulation rates and pond perimeters and basin areas suggesting that peat may be a major source of sediment carbon. Aeolian transport is also a potentially large source of sediment carbon. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Palustrine wetlands (PWs) include all bogs, fens, swamps and marshes that are non-saline and which are not lakes or rivers. They therefore form a highly important group of wetlands which hold large carbon stocks. If these wetlands are not protected properly they could become a net carbon source in the future. Compilation of spatially explicit wetland databases, national inventory data and in situ measurement of soil organic carbon (SOC) could be useful to better quantify SOC and formulate long-term strategies for mitigating global climate change. In this study, a synergistic mapping approach was used to create a hybrid map for PWs for China and to estimate their SOC content. Total SOC storage in PWs was estimated to be 4.3 +/- 1.4 Pg C, with a SOC density of 31.17 (+/- 10.55) kgC m(-2) in the upper 1 m of the soil layer. This carbon stock is concentrated in Northeast China (49%) and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (41%). Given the large pool of carbon stored in PWs compared to other soil types, we suggest that urgent monitoring programmes on SOC should be established in regions with very few datasets, but where PWs appear to be common such as the Tibet region and Northwest China.

AB Controlled laboratory experiments were combined with field measurements to better understand the interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and reduced iron in organic-rich peatlands. Addition of peat-derived humic acid extract (HA) to Sideroxydans lithotrophicus ES-1 liquid cultures led to higher cell numbers and up to 1.4 times higher Fe(II) oxidation rates compared to chemical controls. This effect was positively correlated with increasing HA concentrations. Similar Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxide mineralogies were formed both abiotically and biotically irrespective of HA amendment, but minerals formed in the presence of ES-1 and HA were smaller. ES-1 growth with HA promoted aggregation of Fe(III) products in agarose-stabilized gradient tubes as shown by voltammetric profiling. In situ voltammetry in an acidic, iron-rich peatland revealed a gap between oxygen penetration and iron reduction that may reflect active Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms. The highest abundance of Fe(II)oxidizers Sideroxydans (4.9 x 10(7) gene copies gww(-1)) and Gallionella (1.5 x 10(7) gene copies gww(-1)) in the upper peat layer coincided with small-sized minerals resembling nanoparticulate ferrihydrite or goethite. Our results suggest that microbially mediated Fe(II) oxidation dominates in the presence of DOM leading to the formation of nano-sized biogenic Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides that might be readily bioavailable and likely important to iron and carbon cycling.

AB The cultivation of Sphagnum mosses on re-wetted peat bogs for use in horticulture is a new land use strategy. We provide the first greenhouse gas balances for a field-scale Sphagnum farming experiment on former bog grassland, in its establishment phase. Over two years we used closed chambers to make measurements of GHG exchange on production strips of Sphagnum palustre L. and Sphagnum papillosum Lindb. and on irrigation ditches. Methane fluxes of both Sphagnum species showed a significant decrease over the study period. This trend was stronger for S. papillosum. In contrast, the estimated CO2 fluxes did not show a significant temporal trend over the study period. The production strips of both Sphagnum species were net GHG sinks of 5-9 t ha(-1) a(-1) (in CO2-equivalents) during the establishment phase of the moss carpets. In comparison, the ditches were a CO2 source instead of a CO2 sink and emitted larger amounts of CH4, resulting in net GHG release of similar to 11 t ha(-1) a(-1) CO2-equivalents. We conclude that Sphagnum farming fields should be designed to minimise the area covered by irrigation ditches. Overall, Sphagnum farming on bogs has lower on-field GHG emissions than low-intensity agriculture.

AB Species composition shifts in mangrove forests may alter organic matter dynamics. The purpose of this study was to predict the effect of species replacements among mangrove trees on organic matter dynamics in a mangrove forest on the island of Kosrae. Federated States of Micronesia. We were particularly interested in elements of the carbon cycle that affect peat accumulation rates, organic matter exports to the estuary and coral reef systems, and soil microbiology. We compared organic matter production and decomposition rates among three mangrove species that commonly grow in similar hydrogeomorphic settings: Rhizophora apiculata BL, which is selectively harvested; Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, which may gradually replace Rhizophora; and Sonneratia alba, which is producing few mature fruits. Sonneratia had significantly higher rates of root production (estimated with ingrowth chambers) than Bruguiera or Rhizophora. Sonneratia foliage had significantly faster decomposition rates and significantly lower lignin:nitrogen ratios than Bruguiera foliage. Live root mass was positively correlated with ingrowth and soil carbon, although soil carbon and ingrowth were not significantly correlated with each other. Humic acid concentrations were significantly higher in Sonneratia rhizospheres than in either Bruguiera or Rhizophora rhizospheres and were positively correlated with root ingrowth. The species changes taking place on Kosrae are likely to result in lower rates of root production and foliage decomposition, and more refractory carbon pools in soil.

AB 1. The long-term carbon accumulation rate in a forested peatland in north-east Ontario was examined in relation to gas production and factors which control carbon transport.
   2 Plots of cumulative total mass and cumulative carbon mass against calibrated radio-carbon age estimates when applied to an existing model of peat accumulation, suggest that only very slow decay is occurring within the catotelm.
   3 Gas samples collected from depth shows that both carbon dioxide and methane are present. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analysis yields age estimates of both gases which are between 500 and 2000 years younger than conventional age estimates on adjacent peat. It is suggested that this is due to the downward transport of younger carbon, probably as part of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore waters.
   4 High tritium content of peat pore water at depth indicates the presence of water recharged during the last 40 years and therefore supports this hypothesis. Hydrological data from piezometers confirms the existence of hydraulic gradients for vertical water movement and shows that the direction of flow varies seasonally.
   5 The results indicate that the internal carbon dynamics of peatlands are more complex than has previously been thought and that hydrology may be an important factor in the supply of source carbon for anaerobic decay.

AB Peat carbon accumulation is controlled by both large scale factors, such as climate and hydrological setting, and small scale factors, such as microtopography and plant community. These small scale factors commonly vary within peatlands and can cause variation in biogeochemical traits and carbon accumulation within the same site. To understand these within-site variations, we investigated long term carbon accumulation, peat decomposition, biogeochemistry of pore water and plant macrofossils along a transect in an ombrotrophic bog in southern Patagonia. An additional question we addressed is how historical deposition of volcanic ash on the peatland has affected its carbon balance.
   Variability in plant community and water table led to differences in long term peat and carbon accumulation (peat moss > cushion plant), organic matter decomposition (cushion plant > peat moss), and methane production (peat moss > cushion plant). Macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating indicated a relationship between plant community and carbon accumulation or decomposition during the historical succession of vegetation in the peatland. C/N ratio and isotopic signatures reflected variability in plant community as litter source, and DOC concentrations were controlled by humification level. Volcanic ash deposition had only limited effect on plant composition, but it was associated with increased decomposition in overlying peat layers. This study highlights the importance of understanding how plant communities develop, as changes in communities could significantly affect the potential of ombrotrophic peatlands as C sink.

AB Oligotrophic, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands have been regarded as long-term stable ecosystems that function as carbon sinks. As a result of environmental perturbations, particularly anthropogenic N deposition, this view is now increasingly questioned. We examined whether small-scale field experiments can predict the direction and magnitude of ecosystem responses to increased N supply. We, therefore, compared data from a 10-year field experiment (involving deposition of 2, 15 and 30 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) with data from a gradient associated with increased N deposition (2, 8 and 12 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). We chose to compare: (1) the physiological response of Sphagnum balticum, measured in the form of N accumulation as free amino acids (N-AA); and (2) changes in the total Sphagnum cover, the cover of S. balticum, and vascular plant cover. In all cases we found a highly significant correlation between the two data sets. We attribute the high correspondence between the two data sets to the key function of the dominant group of organisms, the Sphagna, that monopolize N availability and control the water balance, creating an environment hostile to vascular plants. Thus the key role of Sphagna as ecosystem engineers seems to supersede the role of other, scale-dependent processes. We also conclude that N-AA is a sensitive indicator that can be used to signal the slow and gradual shift from Sphagnum to vascular plant dominance.

AB Norbert Pfennig isolated the first acidophilic purple bacterium over 40 years ago and named the organism Rhodopseudomonas acidophila (now Rhodoblastus acidophilus). Since the original work of Pfennig, no systematic study has been conducted on the phylogeny and carbon nutrition of a collection of strains of Rbl. acidophilus. We have isolated six new strains of Rbl. acidophilus from a Canadian peat bog. These strains, three of the original Pfennig strains and two additional putative R. acidophilus strains isolated several years ago in this laboratory, were characterized as to their pigments, phylogeny, and carbon sources supporting photoheterotrophic growth. Phototrophic cultures were either purple or orange in color, and the color of a particular strain was linked to phylogeny. As for the Pfennig strains of Rbl. acidophilus, all new strains grew photoheterotrophically at pH 5 on a variety of organic and fatty acids. However, in addition to methanol and ethanol, the new strains as well as the Pfennig strains grew on several other primary alcohols, results not reported in the original species description. Our work shows that some phylogenetic and physiological diversity exists within the species Rbl. acidophilus and supports the observation that few species of acidophilic purple bacteria appear to exist in nature.

ID DYNAMICS
AB Elevated atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen species, mainly nitrate (NO3 (-)) and ammonium (NH4 (+)), may negatively affect peatland carbon balance and thus contribute to climatic warming. It is difficult to take an accurate inventory of atmospheric N inputs into Sphagnum-dominated bogs, due to uncertainties in estimating horizontal deposition. At two mountain-top peat bogs (Czech Republic, Central Europe), we modelled N interception by replacing S. cuspidatum capitula with polyethylene (PE) strands of an identical surface area. After a 12-week exposure of the samplers to frequent spring and autumn fogs, we compared the amount of N captured by the PE strands (nitrate, ammonium, and organic N) with vertical N deposition via rainfall. Horizontal deposition added 35-69 % N to rainfall N input. The more polluted site exhibited a significantly higher horizontal N deposition than the less polluted site. We scaled our S. cuspidatum data to S. capillifolium, a species common in boreal regions in the form of densely packed carpets. Assuming a proportional decrease in N interception with decreasing Sphagnum surface, we estimated that horizontal deposition in S. capillifolium would add 12-45 % N to rainfall N input. Our data will help to close the N mass balance in peat bogs studies.

AB To assess the effects of global change on peatland vegetation and biogeochemistry we used a long term (21 years) in-situ plot scale manipulation experiment comprising nitrogen (N; ambient and 30 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), temperature (T; ambient and + 3.6 degrees C during growing season) and sulfur (S; ambient and 20 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) treatments in an oligotrophic boreal peatland. Vegetation was assessed by plant species cover estimates, while biogeochemical processes were characterized by measuring potential extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) of glucosidase, cellulase, aminopeptidase, phosphatase, and sulfatase in the peat matrix. We hypothesized that the plant communities would change in response to the N and T manipulations, and that belowground EEA would respond distinctively to the applied treatments as well as to changes in plant community. We found vascular plant cover to have strongly increased in the T treatment, whereas theSphagnumcover collapsed in the high N treatment. Belowground we found enhanced enzymatic C and N acquisition activity in response to the N treatment, but EEA showed no response to the T treatment. No S effects were found, neither aboveground nor belowground. Contrary to our expectations, our data reveal a mismatch between above-ground vegetation patterns and belowground decomposition processes. In particular, the large increase in vascular plant cover in the warming treatment found no reflection in belowground EEA.

SO WETLANDS

DE CARBON DIOXIDE; METHANE; NITROUS OXIDE; CLIMATIC CHANGE; PEATLANDS
AB The emission of three trace gases, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide; and methane, from peatlands is examined, identifying the primary controls and the potential effect of climatic change on emission rates. Nitrous oxide emission from natural peatlands is small and tied to the cycling of nitrogen but increases upon disturbance such as drainage. Peatlands generally act as a sink for carbon dioxide, but they convert from a sink to a source upon drainage. Methane emissions are controlled primarily by position of the water table, with secondary controls of temperature and trophic status of the peat. Canadian and other northern peatlands play a moderately important role in the global methane budget. Climatic change, such as increases in temperature and precipitation predicted by 2 x CO2 scenarios, may result in increased emissions of nitrous oxide, decreased carbon dioxide storage, and reduced methane emissions from Canadian peatlands.

ID METHANE EMISSIONS; CARBON BALANCE; BOG; EXCHANGE; FEN; CO2
AB Flux-chamber measurements of greenhouse gas exchanges between the soil and the atmosphere represent a snapshot of the conditions on a particular site and need to be combined or used in some way to provide integrated fluxes for the longer time periods that are often of interest. In contrast to carbon dioxide (CO2), most studies that have estimated the time-integrated flux of CH4 on ombrotrophic peatlands have not used models. Typically, linear interpolation is used to estimate CH4 fluxes during the time periods between flux-chamber measurements. CH4 fluxes generally show a rise followed by a fall through the growing season that may be captured reasonably well by interpolation, provided there are sufficiently frequent measurements. However, day-to-day and week-to-week variability is also often evident in CH4 flux data, and will not necessarily be properly represented by interpolation. Using flux chamber data from a UK blanket peatland, we compared annualised CH4 fluxes estimated by interpolation with those estimated using linear models and found that the former tended to be higher than the latter. We consider the implications of these results for the calculation of the radiative forcing effect of ombrotrophic peatlands.

AB Vegetation succession in mires is rather well identified using the paleoecological approach. Recently, the ecological succession concept has been extended to ecosystem functions, e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics. Although a strong link between mire vegetation and carbon dynamics is well acknowledged, the successional changes in mire ecosystem functions have remained practically unstudied, especially under the same climate control. To study the patterns and dynamics of CO2 exchange during mire succession, we measured CO2 exchange and vegetation dynamics over 2 growing seasons along a chronosequence on the land uplift coast of the Bay of Bothnia in western Finland. The study showed a decrease in photosynthesis during mire succession that was linked to compositional change in vegetation, i.e., replacement of sedge and herb dominance with the dominance of dwarf shrubs and Sphagna. Similarly, the study revealed decreased variation in gross photosynthesis (P-G) and ecosystem respiration (R-E) over a growing season, which resulted in lower levels of seasonal CO2 dynamics at older stages, The observed successional trend in phenology and CO2 dynamics was largely a consequence of the gradual decrease in the abundance of plant groups with efficient photosynthesis and green area production.

AB [ 1] Peatlands store the majority of soil carbon in many northern regions, yet their vulnerability to fire remains poorly understood. We used large-scale mapping of fire and peatland distributions to explore patterns of burning at two spatial scales. On a landscape scale in central Alberta, we used spatially explicit distributions of peatlands and 50 years of fire perimeter maps to determine whether uplands burn more preferentially than peatlands. Burn area and ignition localities in central Alberta did not occur preferentially in uplands relative to bogs and fens. Extrapolating this result at a regional scale, we used the Peatlands of Canada database and 20 years of historical fire records to estimate annual burn areas for Alberta, British Columbia, Northwest Territories, and Saskatchewan peatlands. Peatland burn areas varied tremendously over time, with high fire activity in the early 1980s and mid-1990s. On average, fires impacted 1850 km 2 of peatland annually across this region of western Canada. Positive relationships between the area of peatland burned and weather variables calculated for each fire event using the Canadian Fire Weather Index, including maximum air temperatures and the duff moisture code, suggest that drier and/or warmer conditions likely would increase the burning of peatlands in western Canada.

AB A substantial amount of below-ground carbon (C) is suggested to be associated with fungi, which may significantly affect the soil C balance in forested ecosystems. Ergosterol from in-growth mesh bags and litterbags was used to estimate fungal biomass production and community composition in drained peatland forests with differing fertility. Extramatrical mycelia (EMM) biomass production was generally higher in the nutrient-poor site, increased with deeper water table level and decreased along the length of the recovery time. EMM biomass production was of the same magnitude as in mineral-soil forests. Saprotrophic fungal biomass production was higher in the nutrient-rich site. Both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic fungal community composition changed according to site fertility and water table level. ECM fungal community composition with different exploration types may explain the differences in fungal biomass production between peatland forests. Melanin-rich Hyaloscypha may indicate decreased turnover of biomass in nutrient-rich young peatland forest. Genera Lactarius and Laccaria may be important in nutrient rich and Piloderma in the nutrient-poor conditions, respectively. Furthermore, Paxillus involutus and Cortinarius sp. may be important generalists in all sites and responsible for EMM biomass production during the first summer months. Saprotrophs showed a functionally more diverse fungal community in the nutrient-rich site.

AB Changes in living and dead root biomass were monitored in the succession created by drainage for forestry on six sites from undrained to 55-yr-old drained tall-sedge pine mires in southern Finland. This was done to evaluate the role of root biomass in carbon cycling in drained peatland ecosystems. The total living Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) root and stump biomass varied from 190 g m(2) on an undrained site to 3060 g m(2) on the oldest drained site. The pine fine root biomass reached the maximum level within 22 yrs of drainage with a pine stand volume of 81 m(3) ha(-1). The pine coarse root and stump biomass increased with the age of the stand, comprising 90% of the total living root biomass on the 55-yr-old drained site. The drainage also increased the root biomass of field layer species; however, the roots of sedges were replaced by those of shrubs and trees. The dead fine root biomass was smallest on the two oldest drained sites, which could have resulted from a higher decomposition rate after improved aeration in the surface peat.

AB Carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis predicts that improved nutrient availability increases the growth of woody plants at the expense of herbivore resistance due to carbon-based secondary metabolites. We tested this hypothesis by growing five clones of white birch (Betula pendula Roth) in two different habitats (mineral and peat soil) for eight years. The growth parameters of the clones and their resistance to hare (Lepus timidus) browsing were measured and compared with the growth/resistance relationship of same clones tested previously at the age of I year. The resistance of birches was evaluated in feeding choice experiments with both captive and free-ranging hares. Experiments using caged or free-ranging hares gave identical results on the feeding pattern by hares indicating that both methods are reliable in measuring the relative palatability of types of woody browse.
   The number of resin droplets on birch twigs is a good indicator of hare resistance., and our results are partly in accordance with the CNB hypothesis: trees grown in mineral soil (optimal conditions) had fewer resin droplets than trees grown in peat soil. Two of the five clones tested were significantly more palatable to hares when grown in mineral soil than the same clones grown in peat soil. Trees growl) in mineral soil were also taller and had greater biomass than trees grown ill peat soil. However, the significant clone x habitat interaction in the production Of resin droplets and growth/palatability relationships indicates that different tree genotypes call have individualistic responses to environmental variations, and thus the responses of all birch clones do not follow the predictions of the CNB hypothesis.
   Similar rank order in the palatability of the Studied birch clones at the age of one and eight years indicates a strong genetic basis for resistance. However, the relationship between height and palatability of birches was negative in the 1-year-old plants but positive in the 8-year-old birches used in this experiment. This may indicate that first-year seedlings attain both optimal growth and high resistance at high nutrient supply with no trade-off between growth and resistance. On the whole, more experiments are needed to determine the mechanisms of resistance, especially in Young seedlings and older saplings grown in different environments.

AB Peatlands of continental western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) cover 365 157 km(2) and store 48.0 Pg of carbon representing 2.1% of the world's terrestrial carbon within 0.25% of the global landbase. Only a small amount, 0.10 Pg (0.2%) of this carbon, is currently stored in the above-ground biomass. Carbon storage in peatlands has changed significantly since deglaciation. Peatlands began to accumulate carbon around 9000 years ago in this region, after an initial deglacial lag. Carbon accumulation was climatically limited throughout much of continental western Canada by early Holocene maximum insolation. After 6000 BP, carbon accumulation increased significantly, with about half of current stores being reached by 4000 BP. Around 3000 BP carbon accumulation in continental western Canada began to slow as permafrost developed throughout the subarctic and boreal region and the current southern limit of peatlands was reached. Peatlands in continental western Canada continue to increase their total carbon storage today by 19.4 g m(-2) year(-1), indicating that regionally this ecosystem remains a large carbon sink.

AB Large areas in Northern Russia are covered by extensive mires, which represent a complex mosaic of ombrotrophic raised bogs, minerotrophic and eutrophic fens, all in a close proximity to each other. In this paper, we compared microbial diversity patterns in the surface peat layers of the neighbouring raised bogs and eutrophic fens that are located within two geographically remote mire sites in Vologda region using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Regardless of location, the microbial communities in raised bogs were highly similar to each other but were clearly distinct from those in eutrophic fens. Bogs were dominated by the Acidobacteria (30%-40% of total 16S rRNA gene reads), which belong to the orders Acidobacteriales and Bryobacterales. Other bog-specific bacteria included the Phycisphaera-like group WD2101 and the families Isosphaeraceae and Gemmataceae of the Planctomycetes, orders Opitutales and Pedosphaerales of the Verrucomicrobia and a particular group of alphaproteobacteria within the Rhizobiales. In contrast, fens hosted Anaerolineae-affiliated Chloroflexi, Vicinamibacteria- and Blastocatellia-affiliated Acidobacteria, Rokubacteria, uncultivated group OM190 of the Planctomycetes and several groups of betaproteobacteria. The Patescibacteria were detected in both types of wetlands but their relative abundance was higher in fens. A number of key parameters that define the distribution of particular bacterial groups in mires were identified.

AB Though microbial transformations are the primary mechanism of contaminant attenuation in wetlands, much remains to be known about microbial communities in urban wetlands. In this study, the microbial communities from urban wetlands with different runoff regimes (i.e., a contaminated remnant wetland, a constructed wetland, and a remnant wetland) were assessed for their capacity to attenuate and tolerate typical urban runoff pollutants. Results from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA genes showed relatively high similarity in community composition among the wetlands. Community-level physiological profiles had similar results but exhibited within-site variation in both the contaminated remnant and remnant wetlands. All wetland communities were less tolerant to copper than 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; however, the contaminated remnant wetland had the highest tolerance. All study wetlands had a limited capacity to biodegrade model chlorinated aromatic compounds (e. g., 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 3-chlorobenzoate). Though having different input regimes and contaminant exposure histories, the study wetlands were generally similar with respect to microbial community diversity and function. Additionally, the generally low capacity for these wetlands to biodegrade mobile chlorinated organic contaminants offers preliminary insight into the limited ecosystem services these wetlands may provide in urban environments.

AB We estimated the magnitude of the radiative forcing (RF) due to changes in albedo following the forestation of peatlands, and calculated the net RF by taking into account the changes in both the albedo and the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes during one forest rotation. Data on radiation, tree biomass, and soil GHG fluxes were combined with models for canopy cover, tree carbon accumulation, and the RF due to increased atmospheric GHG concentrations for four typical site cases in Finland covering two soil nutrient levels in the south and north of the country. We also studied the observed long-term surface temperatures to detect any indications of drainage-induced effects. The magnitude of the albedo-induced RF was similar to that caused by the carbon sequestration of the growing trees. At three site cases out of four the drainage induced a cooling or negative RF, the tendency for cooling being higher at sites with a higher nutrient level. The differences in albedo-induced RF mainly arose from the spring season due to (1) the different snow cover duration in the south versus the north, and (2) the different albedos of drained and undrained snow covered peatlands. An increase in the maximum daily temperatures was observed in April in southern Finland, where the most intensive drainage practices have taken place, suggesting that forestry drainage has potentially affected the local climate. Our results show that the decreasing albedo resulting from peatland forestation contributes significantly to the RF, balancing out or even exceeding the cooling effect due to the changing GHG fluxes.

AB Subgrid processes occur in various ecosystems and landscapes but, because of their small scale, they are not represented or poorly parameterized in climate models. These local heterogeneities are often important or even fundamental for energy and carbon balances. This is especially true for northern peatlands and in particular for the polygonal tundra, where methane emissions are strongly influenced by spatial soil heterogeneities. We present a stochastic model for the surface topography of polygonal tundra using Poisson-Voronoi diagrams and we compare the results with available recent field studies. We analyze seasonal dynamics of water table variations and the landscape response under different scenarios of precipitation income. We upscale methane fluxes by using a simple idealized model for methane emission. Hydraulic interconnectivities and large-scale drainage may also be investigated through percolation properties and thresholds in the Voronoi graph. The model captures the main statistical characteristics of the landscape topography, such as polygon area and surface properties as well as the water balance. This approach enables us to statistically relate large-scale properties of the system to the main small-scale processes within the single polygons.

AB CO, and CH4 fluxes were measured front three small wetland lakes located in the middle taiga and forest tundra zones on West Siberian Lowlands (WSL), the world's largest wetland area. Fluxes were measured during summer 2005 using floating chambers and were validated against the thin boundary layer model based on the relationship between gas exchange and wind speed. All Studied lakes were supersaturated with CO2 and CH4, and acted on a seasonal basis as sources of these,greenhouse bases to the atmosphere. Daily mean CO, fluxes measured with chambers ranged from near the zero to 3.1 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and corresponding CH4 fluxes from 1.1 to 120 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). CH4 ebullition (0.65-11 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) was detected in two of the lakes. Total carbon evasion from the studied lakes during the active season was 23-66 g C m(-2). of which more than 90% was released as CO2-C. The carbon loss per unit area from the studied lakes was of similar magnitude as previously reported values of net carbon uptake of Siberian peatlands. This emphasizes the importance of small water-bodies in the carbon balance of West Siberian landscape.

AB The present area of European wetlands is only a fraction of their area before the start of large-scale human colonization of Europe. Many European wetlands have been exploited and managed for various purposes. Large wetland areas have been drained and reclaimed mainly for agriculture and establishment of human settlements. These threats to European wetlands persist. The main responses of European wetlands to ongoing climate change will vary according to wetland type and geographical location. Sea level rise will probably be the decisive factor affecting coastal wetlands, especially along the Atlantic coast. In the boreal part of Europe, increased temperatures will probably lead to increased annual evapotranspiration and lower organic matter accumulation in soil. The role of vast boreal wetlands as carbon sinks may thus be suppressed. In central and western Europe, the risk of floods may support the political will for ecosystem-unfriendly flood defence measures, which may threaten the hydrology of existing wetlands. Southern Europe will probably suffer most from water shortage, which may strengthen the competition for water resources between agriculture, industry and settlements on the one hand and nature conservancy, including wetland conservation, on the other.

AB Information about the annual carbon fluxes of fen and meadow ecosystems in alpine environments is rare. We studied the influence of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), plant green area index (GAI), soil temperature, and water-filled pore space (wfps) on the net CO2 emission at four alpine sites (one meadow and three fen sites) differing in water balance and plant community. Measurements over two years were made in the Eastern Alps, Austria, including two snow-free periods and two snow periods. During snow-free periods, net CO2 gain during daylight periods (NEElight, PAR > 0) depended on PAR and GAI. The net CO2 emission rate at night (R-tot, PAR = 0) was positively related to soil temperature, while low wfps reduced the carbon loss via R-tot of the meadow and driest fen study site but reinforced carbon loss of the wetter fen sites. Daily average ecosystem net CO, gain (NEEday) during snow-free periods (averaged over both years) at the meadow was 3.5 g CO2 m(-2)d(-1) and ranged from 1.5 to 3.4 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at the fen sites. Mean average daily wintertime CO2 emission was low, being only -0.9 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) for meadow and between -0.2 and -0.7 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1) for all fen sites. All sites function as significant annual net carbon sinks, with a net carbon gain from 50 to 121 g C m(-2) a(-1) (averaged over both years) irrespective of water balance. Our results indicate that these alpine fen sites that have built up a large carbon stock in the past do not gain a further carbon surplus compared with the meadow under the current climate.

AB In this study, we examined how land use and urbanization changes in adjacent areas affected biological productivity and carbon cycling in a lake ecosystem over 100 years and how these changes are reflected in carbon isotope variations. We performed radiocarbon (C-14) activity and stable carbon isotope ratio analysis in two organic fractions: humin and humic acids of lake sediment. Additionally, we performed pigment and diatom analysis and determined the carbonate and organic matter (OM) content in sediments. Over the last century, the estimated C-14 reservoir age in both sediment organic fractions varied from 1136 +/- 112 yr to 5733 +/- 122 yr. The increase in the reservoir age by 1175 +/- 111 yr was related with higher inputs of pre-aged organic carbon and C-14 depleted hard water due to the opening of the channel connecting two lakes. Nuclear weapons tests caused an increase in the reservoir age of up to 5421 +/- 135 yr and 5733 +/- 122 yr in humin and humic acids, respectively.C- 13 values in the humic acid fraction showed a tendency to decrease, depending on the content of autochthonous versus allochthonous OM in sediments, while changes in the sources of OM had a minor impact on the stable carbon isotope composition in the humin fraction.

AB Roughly 3% of the Earth's land surface burns annually, representing a critical exchange of energy and matter between the land and atmosphere via combustion. Fires range from slow smouldering peat fires, to low-intensity surface fires, to intense crown fires, depending on vegetation structure, fuel moisture, prevailing climate, and weather conditions. While the links between biogeochemistry, climate and fire are widely studied within Earth system science, these relationships are also mediated by fuels-namely plants and their litter-that are the product of evolutionary and ecological processes. Fire is a powerful selective force and, over their evolutionary history, plants have evolved traits that both tolerate and promote fire numerous times and across diverse clades. Here we outline a conceptual framework of how plant traits determine the flammability of ecosystems and interact with climate and weather to influence fire regimes. We explore how these evolutionary and ecological processes scale to impact biogeochemical and Earth system processes. Finally, we outline several research challenges that, when resolved, will improve our understanding of the role of plant evolution in mediating the fire feedbacks driving Earth system processes. Understanding current patterns of fire and vegetation, as well as patterns of fire over geological time, requires research that incorporates evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and the biogeosciences.

AB Questions
   What impact do a wet and a dry growing season have on CO2 dynamics of mire plant communities along a primary succession gradient from the initiation stage to the bog stage?
   Location
   Mires on a land uplift coast, Finland.
   Methods
   We measured CO2 dynamics and vascular plant green area development on five mires that form a sequence of mire succession. TWINSPAN was used to define successional mire plant communities and regression analyses were used to explore the temporal variation in CO2 dynamics of the communities.
   Results
   CO2 dynamics of successional plant communities reacted differently to a wet and a dry growing season. The net CO2 uptake rate of the earlier successional communities decreased in the dry growing season due to a decrease in photosynthesizing leaf area. Concurrently, CO2 uptake of the later successional communities moderately increased or did not change. Generally, the difference in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) between a dry and a wet year resulted from the altered rate of gross photosynthesis (P-G) rather than ecosystem respiration (R-E).
   Conclusions
   Critical factors for the more stable carbon (C) gas dynamics in the later stages of mire succession were (1) higher autogenic control of the physical environment and (2) an increase in the number of factors regulating the P-G rate. These factors may buffer mire ecosystems (in terms of the C sink function) from extreme and unfavourable variations in environmental conditions.

AB It is important that climate models can accurately simulate the terrestrial carbon cycle in the Arctic due to the large and potentially labile carbon stocks found in permafrost-affected environments, which can lead to a positive climate feedback, along with the possibility of future carbon sinks from northward expansion of vegetation under climate warming. Here we evaluate the simulation of tundra carbon stocks and fluxes in three land surface schemes that each form part of major Earth system models (JSBACH, Germany; JULES, UK; ORCHIDEE, France). We use a site-level approach in which comprehensive, high-frequency datasets allow us to disentangle the importance of different processes. The models have improved physical permafrost processes and there is a reasonable correspondence between the simulated and measured physical variables, including soil temperature, soil moisture and snow.
   We show that if the models simulate the correct leaf area index (LAI), the standard C3 photosynthesis schemes produce the correct order of magnitude of carbon fluxes. Therefore, simulating the correct LAI is one of the first priorities. LAI depends quite strongly on climatic variables alone, as we see by the fact that the dynamic vegetation model can simulate most of the differences in LAI between sites, based almost entirely on climate inputs. However, we also identify an influence from nutrient limitation as the LAI becomes too large at some of the more nutrient-limited sites. We conclude that including moss as well as vascular plants is of primary importance to the carbon budget, as moss contributes a large fraction to the seasonal CO2 flux in nutrient-limited conditions. Moss photosynthetic activity can be strongly influenced by the moisture content of moss, and the carbon uptake can be significantly different from vascular plants with a similar LAI.
   The soil carbon stocks depend strongly on the rate of input of carbon from the vegetation to the soil, and our analysis suggests that an improved simulation of photosynthesis would also lead to an improved simulation of soil carbon stocks. However, the stocks are also influenced by soil carbon burial (e.g. through cryoturbation) and the rate of heterotrophic respiration, which depends on the soil physical state. More detailed below-ground measurements are needed to fully evaluate biological and physical soil processes. Furthermore, even if these processes are well modelled, the soil carbon profiles cannot resemble peat layers as peat accumulation processes are not represented in the models.
   Thus, we identify three priority areas for model development: (1) dynamic vegetation including (a) climate and (b) nutrient limitation effects; (2) adding moss as a plant functional type; and an (3) improved vertical profile of soil carbon including peat processes.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of medium pH and different concentrations of sucrose, fructose, and glucose on the regeneration and development of D. pinifolius axillary shoots on full- and half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium using different explant types. The results show that suitable pH for D. pinifolius growth in vitro is 5.8. Single nodes should be avoided in the multiplication phase, and terminal buds and shoots should be used as explants. They can be cultured on half-strength MS medium with pH 6.3 and 10 g l(-1)sucrose, on MS medium with pH 5.8 containing 30 g l(-1) sucrose, and on MS medium with 30 g l(-1) glucose and pH 6.3. The rooting percentage was high on MS medium containing 0.5 mg l(-1) NAA, 95% of single nodes and shoots and 96.7% of terminal buds formed roots. The highest acclimatization percentage of obtained microplants (95.5%) was achieved in a 4 : 1 mixture of peat and sand.

AB Although microorganisms are the primary drivers of biogeochemical cycles, the structure and functioning of microbial food webs are poorly studied. This is the case in Sphagnum peatlands, where microbial communities play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Here, we explored the structure of the microbial food web from a Sphagnum peatland by analyzing (1) the density and biomass of different microbial functional groups, (2) the natural stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) signatures of key microbial consumers (testate amoebae), and (3) the digestive vacuole contents of Hyalosphenia papilio, the dominant testate amoeba species in our system. Our results showed that the feeding type of testate amoeba species (bacterivory, algivory, or both) translates into their trophic position as assessed by isotopic signatures. Our study further demonstrates, for H. papilio, the energetic benefits of mixotrophy when the density of its preferential prey is low. Overall, our results show that testate amoebae occupy different trophic levels within the microbial food web, depending on their feeding behavior, the density of their food resources, and their metabolism (i.e., mixotrophy vs. heterotrophy). Combined analyses of predation, community structure, and stable isotopes now allow the structure of microbial food webs to be more completely described, which should lead to improved models of microbial community function.

AB The mechanisms, pathways, and rates of CO2 and CH4 production are central to understanding carbon cycling and greenhouse gas flux in wetlands. Thawing permafrost regions are of particular interest because they are disproportionally affected by climate warming and store large reservoirs of organic C that may be readily converted to CO2 and CH4 upon thaw. This conversion is accomplished by a community of microorganisms interacting in complex ways to transform large organic compounds into fatty acids and ultimately CO2 and CH4. While the central role of microbes in this process is well-known, geochemical rate models rarely integrate microbiological information. Herein, we expanded the geochemical rate model of Neumann et al., (2016, Biogeochemistry 127: 57-87) to incorporate a Bayesian probability analysis and applied the result to quantifying rates of CO2, CH4, and acetate production in closed-system incubations of peat collected from three habitats along a permafrost thaw gradient. The goals of this analysis were twofold. First, we integrated microbial community analyses with geochemical rate modeling by using microbial data to inform the best model choice among equally mathematically feasible model variants. Second, based on model results, we described changes in organic carbon transformation among habitats to understand the changing pathways of greenhouse gas production along the permafrost thaw gradient. We found that acetoclasty, hydrogenotrophy, CO2 production, and homoacetogenesis were the important reactions in this system, with little evidence for anaerobic CH4 oxidation. There was a distinct transition in the reactions across the thaw gradient. The collapsed palsa stage presents an initial disequilibrium where the abrupt (physically and temporally) change in elevation introduces freshly fixed carbon into anoxic conditions then fermentation products build up over time as the system transitions through the acid phase and electron acceptors are depleted. In the bog, fermentation slows, while methanogenesis increases. In the fully thawed fen, most of the terminal electron acceptors are depleted and the system becomes increasingly methanogenic. This suggests that as permafrost regions thaw and dry palsas transition into wet fens, CH4 emissions will rise, increasing the warming potential of these systems and accelerating climate warming feedbacks.

AB The biomarker composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the six largest Arctic rivers was studied between 2003 and 2007 as part of the PARTNERS Project. Samples were collected over seasonal cycles relatively close to the river mouths. Here we report the lignin phenol and p-hydroxybenzene composition of Arctic river DOC in order to identify major sources of carbon. Arctic river DOC represents an important carbon conduit linking the large pools of organic carbon in the Arctic/Subarctic watersheds to the Arctic Ocean. Most of the annual lignin discharge (>75%) occurs during the two month of spring freshet with extremely high lignin concentrations and a lignin phenol composition indicative of fresh vegetation from boreal forests. The three large Siberian rivers, Lena, Yenisei, and Ob, which also have the highest proportion of forests within their watersheds, contribute about 90% of the total lignin discharge to the Arctic Ocean. The composition of river DOC is also characterized by elevated levels of p-hydroxybenzenes, particularly during the low flow season, which indicates a larger contribution from mosses and peat bogs. The lignin composition was strongly related to the average C-14-age of DOC supporting the abundance of young, boreal-vegetation-derived leachates during spring flood, and older, soil-, peat-, and wetland-derived DOC during groundwater dominated low flow conditions, particularly in the Ob and Yukon Rivers. We observed significant differences in DOC concentration and composition between the rivers over the seasonal cycles with the Mackenzie River being the most unique, the Lena River being similar to the Yenisei, and the Yukon being most similar to the Ob. The observed relationship between the lignin phenol composition and watershed characteristics suggests that DOC discharge from these rivers could increase in a warmer climate under otherwise undisturbed conditions.

AB Throughout the last two centuries peatlands have been subject to extensive drainage, typically through the digging of ditches. Ecosystem restoration now focusses on damming or infilling these ditches to increase biodiversity and to provide a range of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water provision. We surveyed 60 bog pools created following ditch blocking (alone) on a blanket bog in north Wales. Eighteen months after restoration the mean total pool vegetation cover was 76%. There was a strong negative relationship between pool depth and Eriophorum cover (r(2) = 0.74), and a weaker positive relationship between depth and Sphagnum cover (r(2) = 0.35). Observations showed that pools had been colonised by various invertebrate species. Pool dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were not connected to pool vegetation, suggesting that catchment-scale processes drive DOC. Other studies have shown that Eriophorum generates large methane fluxes, and that Sphagnum can act as a methane sink. Therefore we recommend that pools should be deeper than 0.5 m to give the greatest carbon benefit, whilst noting that this is unlikely to significantly affect DOC fluxes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

AB In the boreal zone, large areas of natural mires have been drained and used for agriculture, resulting in net carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions and increased nitrous oxide emissions but decreased methane emissions. However, due to structural changes in agriculture, a substantial area of cropland on organic soil has been afforested. In order to estimate the carbon balance of afforested organic-soil cropland, we measured CO, and water vapour (H 20) fluxes during year above a Scots pine plantation (Pinus sylvestris) in the middle-boreal zone, using the micrometeorological eddy covariance method. We observed CO2 uptake by the Scots pine stand from late April to mid-October with a daily average net uptake from May to the beginning of October. However, there were also periods of daily net efflux. High ecosystem respiration rates continued throughout the winter (mean winter respiration 0.036 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). As an annual average, the 30-year-old pine stand was a small source of CO2 (+50 g m(-2) a(-1)) to the atmosphere, showing that the CO2 sequestration into the ecosystem was able to compensate for most of the carbon that was released by heterotrophic respiration from the drained soil.

AB Peatlands have influenced Holocene carbon (C) cycling by storing atmospheric C and releasing methane (CH4). Yet, our understanding of contributions from the world's second largest peatland, the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada, to peat-climate-C-dynamics is constrained by the paucity of dated peat records and regional C-data. Here we examine HBL peatland development in relation to Holocene C-dynamics. We show that peat initiation in the HBL is tightly coupled with glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) through most of the record, and occurred within suitable climatic conditions for peatland development. HBL peatlands initiated most intensively in the mid-Holocene, when GIA was most rapid and climate was cooler and drier. As the peat mass developed, we estimate that the HBL potentially released 1-7 Tg CH4 per year during the late Holocene. Our results indicate that the HBL currently stores a C-pool of similar to 30 Pg C and provide support for a peatland-derived CH4 contribution to the late Holocene atmosphere.

AB Northern European peatlands are important habitats for biological conservation because they support rich biodiversity and unique species compositions. However, historical management of peatland habitats has had negative consequences for biodiversity and their degradation remains a major conservation concern. Despite increasing awareness of the conservation value of peatlands, the statuses and ecological requirements of peat land species have remained largely understudied. Here, we first analysed temporal trends of Northern European peatland birds to document the status of their populations using bird data from five different countries. Second, we used Finnish monitoring data to assess habitat preferences of peatland bird species, hence helping to target conservation to the most relevant habitat types. There was a general decline of 40% in Northern European peatland bird population sizes in 1981-2014 (speed of decline 1.5%/year) largely driven by Finland, where populations declined almost 50% (2.0% annual decline). In Sweden and Norway, peatland bird populations declined by 20% during 1997-2014 (1.0% annual decline). In contrast, southern populations in Estonia and Latvia, where the majority of open peatlands are protected, showed a 40% increase during 1981-2014 (1.0% annual increase). The most important habitat characteristics preferred by common peatland species in Finland were openness and low tree height, while wetness proved to be an important feature for waders. Drainage of peatlands had clear negative effects on the densities of many species, with the only exception of rustic bunting, which specializes on edge habitats. Our findings call for more effective conservation actions in Northern European peatland habitats, especially in Finland where peatland drainage represents a major threat to biodiversity.

AB Peatlands are the largest natural carbon store as a result of environmental conditions that limit decomposition rates. However, climate change is predicted to threaten peatland C sink function through rising temperatures, lowered water tables and the expansion of vascular plants. Here, by selecting four peatland habitats differing in their dominant plant communities and abiotic conditions, we investigated the influence of the most relevant climatic factors (namely temperature and soil water content) in controlling the spatial and temporal responses of soil organisms and their potential links to above-ground plant functional diversity. We found that the soil mesofaunal communities under vascular plants were mainly dominated by microarthropods (oribatid mites and collembolans), and contrasted with those under mosses that consisted of enchytreids and dipterans (approximate to 15% dissimilarity). We show that the balance of tolerance to drought and saturation determined the temporal dynamics and vertical stratification of the soil invertebrate populations. From this, we anticipate that the projected expansion of vascular plants not only will displace active peat forming vegetation species (mosses), but also those invertebrates that are poorly adapted to the new environment (enchytraeids and dipteral larvae). Our findings indicate future peatland responses to environmental changes should take into account the habitat complexity above- and below-ground community structure) and the modulating effects of the abiotic environment.

TI Effect of forest drainage on the carbon balance of a mire: A case study
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
LA English

ID PEATLANDS
AB Natural mires generally act as sinks for CO2 and are sources of CH4 for the atmosphere. However, drainage may transform these ecosystems into net sources of CO2, but the increase in growth of the tree stand and consequent fixation of carbon after drainage may be expected to have a compensating effect. The post-drainage change in the peat carbon stores was determined using a method based on the bulk density and carbon content profiles measured along a transect running from the undrained part to the drained part of the mire. The difference between the undrained and drained peat carbon stores, averaged over the 30 yr period after drainage, indicated that the accumulation of carbon had been 35 g C m(-2) yr(-1) greater in the undrained site. As the long-term accumulation rate of the undrained site had been 21 g C m(-2) yr(-1), the drained part had lost 14 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from the pre-drainage carbon store. Total accumulated biomass in the tree stand was estimated from stem wood development using the growth and yield tables for this site type. The stem wood volumes were transformed into total biomass values using published stem-volume/total-biomass ratios. If no harvesting operations were to occur during the first 300 yrs, the tree stand would produce an average carbon store of approximately 11 kg C m(-2). The application of a standard thinning regime would reduce this storage by ca 50%. Expressed as an average over 300 yrs, drainage increased the total carbon store of the mire if no tree harvesting was done and the store remained unchanged if standard harvesting procedures were used.

AB Permafrost in peatlands of subarctic Sweden is presently thawing at accelerated rates, which raises questions about the destiny of stored carbon and nutrients and impacts on adjacent freshwater ecosystems. In this study we use peat and lake sediment records from the Stordalen palsa mire in northern Sweden to address the late Holocene (5,000 cal BP-present) development of the mire as well as related changes in carbon and nutrient cycling. Formation, sediment accumulation and biogeochemistry of two studied lakes are suggested to be largely controlled by the development of the mire and its permafrost dynamics. Peat inception took place at ca. 4,700 cal BP as a result of terrestrialisation. Onset of organic sedimentation in the adjacent lakes occurred at ca. 3,400 and 2,650 cal BP in response to mire expansion and permafrost aggradation, respectively. Mire erosion, possibly due to permafrost decay, led to re-deposition of peat into one of the lakes after ca. 2,100 cal BP, and stimulated primary productivity in the other lake at ca. 1,900-1,800 cal BP. Carbonate precipitation appears to have been suppressed when acidic poor fen and bog (palsa) communities dominated the catchment mire, and permafrost-induced changes in hydrology may further have affected the inflow of alkaline water from the catchment. Elevated contents of biogenic silica and diatom pigments in lake sediments during periods of poor fen and bog expansion further indicate that terrestrial vegetation influenced the amount of nutrients entering the lake. Increased productivity in the lake likely caused bottom-water anoxia in the downstream lake and led to recycling of sediment phosphorous, bringing the lake into a state of self-sustained eutrophication during two centuries preceding the onset of twentieth century permafrost thaw. Our results give insight into nutrient and permafrost dynamics in a subarctic wetland and imply that continued permafrost decay and related vegetation changes towards minerotrophy may increase carbon and nutrient storage of mire deposits and reduce nutrient fluxes in runoff. Rapid permafrost degradation may on the other hand lead to widespread mire erosion and to relatively short periods of significantly increased nutrient loading in adjacent lakes.

AB Reactive mixtures to be used in a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) for the treatment of low quality groundwater derived from a mine waste rock storage site were evaluated. Low pH drainage water from the site contained high concentrations of sulfate and dissolved metals, including Al, Co, Ni, and Zn. Column experiments were conducted to evaluate whether mixtures containing either peat moss (as an organic carbon source) or a mixture of peat moss and granular zero-valent iron (ZVI) filings, in addition to small amounts of lime and/or limestone, were suitable treatment materials for removing these metals from the water. The experimental results showed that the mixtures promote bacterially-mediated sulfate reduction and metal removal by precipitation of metal sulfides, metal carbonate/hydroxide precipitation, and adsorption under relatively high pH conditions (pH of 7-8). Both reactive mixtures removed influent dissolved metals to near or below the limit of detection in the effluent throughout the experiment; however, influent-level concentrations of the metals of interest gradually moved through the column containing peat alone, as the pH neutralizing ability in the mixture was consumed. In contrast, the column containing both peat and ZVI showed very little breakthrough of the influent metals, suggesting that the longevity of the mixture including ZVI will be much longer than the mixture containing peat alone. The results show that both reactive mixtures should be effective in a PRB installation as long as neutral pH conditions and microbial activity are maintained. The cost to performance ratio of the two reactive mixtures will be a key factor in determining which mixture is best suited for a particular site. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Selective inhibition of substrate-induced respiration with antibiotics cycloheximide and streptomycin sulphate provided insight into eukaryotic versus prokaryotic activities in surface peat soil of three Canadian peatlands. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities in peatlands are important in the net sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and therefore play a unique role in global carbon cycling. Selective inhibition techniques were generally successful, with a maximum non-target inhibition of only 17%. Assuming that eukaryotic and prokaryotic activities were dominated by fungi and bacteria respectively, across 3 ecologically and hydrologically diverse and spatially dispersed peatlands, we demonstrated bacterial dominance in a bog and a poor fen both with acidic and primarily Sphagnum derived peat soil and in a near pH neutral wetter rich fen with sedge peat (fungal to bacterial activity ratio = 0.31 to 0.68). These results differ in that in other acidic environments, such as conifer forest soils, fungal to bacterial activity ratios are mostly greater than 1 indicative of fungal dominance.

AB Rivers link terrestrial and marine biospheres by transporting carbon from land to ocean and by exchanging CO2 with the atmosphere. In an attempt to quantify the aquatic carbon cycle, we developed a technique based on carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) and oxygen isotopic composition of dissolved oxygen (delta O-18(DO)). The approach was tested on selected boreal ecosystems in the Ottawa area, Canada: Meech Lake; the Ottawa River; and Green Creek, the latter dewatering the Mer Bleue bog. The three ecosystems were monitored for 1 yr and the calculated aquatic respiration/photosynthesis ratios in general fell within the 1 to 3.5 ranges. The ecosystems were respiration dominated year-round, despite increased photosynthetic rates during the warm season, a development that was apparently matched by a comparable enhancement in respiration rates. The year-round predominance of respiration over photosynthesis supports the results of earlier studies, showing that boreal aquatic ecosystems, particularly the lakes, are not solely dissipation pathways for soil-generated CO2 introduced into surficial water bodies by groundwater input. To fuel this year-round "excess" respiration, the steady state balance consideration demands that the ecosystem must have a continuous supply of allochthonous reduced carbon.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is among the vegetation parameters that play an important role in climate, hydrological and ecological studies, and is used for assessing growth and expansion of vegetation. The main objective of this study was to develop a methodology to map the LAI distribution of birch trees (Betula pendula) in peatland ecosystems using field-based instruments and airborne-based remote-sensing techniques. The developed mapping method was validated using field-based LAI measurements using the LAI-2000 instrument. First vegetation indices, including simple ratio (SR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and reduced simple ratio (RSR), were derived from HyMap data and related to ground-based measurements of LAI. LAI related better with RSR (R-2 = 0.68), followed by NDVI (R-2 = 0.63) and SR (R-2 = 0.58), respectively. Areas with birch were identified using Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) to classify the image into 11 end members of dominant species including bare soil and open water. Next, the relationship between LAI and RSR was applied to areas with birch, yielding a birch LAI map. Comparison of the map of the birch trees and field-based LAI data was done using linear regression, yielding an R-2 = 0.38 and an RMSE = 0.25, which is fairly accurate for a structurally highly diverse field situation. The method may prove an invaluable tool to monitor tree encroachment and assess tree LAI in these remote and poorly accessible areas.

AB This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest of native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occuring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock. water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil.

AB Tierra del Fuego Island hosts the largest area of peatlands in the Southern Hemisphere, largely encompassing peat bogs where peat is actively formed and thus acting as carbon sinks. Under a scenario of increasing human pressure, the development of scientific tools for the characterization and monitoring of these systems is highly relevant. Desmids have been used as bioindicators in wetlands on account of their high sensitivity to changes in the environment. Here we identified the main drivers of periphytic and planktonic desmid communities in two Fuegian peat bogs, hosting two types of aquatic environments: clear and vegetated pools. Although peat bogs differed in overall species richness and diversity for both communities, some clear trends were detected regarding their dependence on environmental conditions. Unexpectedly, the taxonomic composition of the periphytic desmids did not depend on the substrate. Instead, their diversity and species richness changed along a minero-ombrotrophic gradient. As for planktonic desmids, their abundance and life strategy jointly changed from few large-sized species to larger numbers of small-sized species along with terrestrialization stage of the pools. We conclude that both desmid communities can be used complementarily to monitor changes over time in the trophic and terrestrialization status of peat bog pools.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry causes the water level to draw down, which results in subsidence of peat surface and increased peat bulk density (D-b) Later on, an accelerated rate of organic matter decomposition and the pressure of the growing tree stand further compacts the peat. We measured the peat D-b (0-80 cm) in 180 undrained and 209 drained (ca. 60-year-old) peatland sites representing three nutrient levels of pine fens and five macroclimatic regions from southern to northern Finland. D-b was affected by climatic conditions, nutrient status, and the tree stand volume of the site. D-b was significantly higher in drained than in undrained sites in all regions and site types: the mean (+/-SD) D-b in the whole material was 82 +/- 23 kg.m(-3) for the undrained sites and 133 +/- 22 kg.m(-3) for the drained sites. The increase in D-b was significant in all regions down to a depth of 60 cm and in southern Finland, even deeper than 80 cm. When the increase in carbon concentration was taken into consideration, the average postdrainage increase in the Db Of the 0-80 cm layer equalled the amount of carbon in the 54-cm layer in average undrained peat. As the reported subsidences of pear surface in forest drainage areas in Finland are usually below this limit, the carbon storage of peat is likely to increase after drainage.

AB Humic substances are important environmental components since they represent a very large part of organic compounds on earth. According to many reports, dissolved humic substances are a determinant parameter for the bioavailability of xenobiotic compounds. For the present bioavailability studies, two kinds of dissolved humic substances, a commercially available humic acid and fulvic acids isolated from peat were used. As the relevant xenobiotic, a defined branched nonylphenol isomer, 4 (3',5'-dimethyl-3'-heptyl)-phenol (p353NP) was synthesised according to Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Equilibrium dialysis studies were implemented in order to investigate the association between C-14-labelled p353NP and dissolved humic substances. The biodegradability in the presence of dissolved humic substances was examined in experiments with the nonylphenol degrading bacterium strain Sphingomonas TTNP3 and with p353NP as sole carbon source. The results showed that p353NP-humic acid associates were formed in high amounts, whereas no adducts with fulvic acids occurred. In the degradation studies with Sphingomonas TTNP3, no effects of dissolved humic substances on the bioavailability of p353NP could be observed. It was assumed that the association between nonylphenol and humic acids occurs rapidly and is reversible. Thus, the formation of "labile" complexes did not influence biodegradation rates, which were quite low.

AB Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains SEMIA 587 and SEMIA 5019 were evaluated for growth and competition in liquid broth cultures and in sterilized peat. Nodulation ability, strain nodule occupancy rates and dinitrogen fixation were investigated in Leonard jar experiments using soybean plants as host. B. japonicum strains SEMIA 587 and 5019 were grown together in a bench-top fermenter or separately in shake-flask cultures, using glycerol as primary carbon source. Maximum growth rate and generation time occurred at 28 degrees C and 250 rpm. Maximum productivity was at 28 degrees C and 300 rpm. Shake-flask cultures inoculated with equal numbers of both strains contained 69% of strain 587 and 31% of strain 5019 after 120 hours (double-strain broth), due to the lower growth rate and productivity of strain 5019. When double-strain broth was added to sterilized peat only 10.2% of strain 5019 was recovered after 180 days of incubation, but when sterilized peat was inoculated with a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of the strains, 37% of strain 5019 was recovered after the same time period. Total cell numbers increased during 30 days of incubation at 24 degrees C-25 degrees C and then declined. Mixed inoculi containing both strains generally showed higher nodule occupancy rates for strain 587.

AB Organic compounds released in peat drying in a laboratory fluidized-bed reactor were analyzed by chromatographic methods in order to evaluate process operational and environmental aspects.  For comparison, pine bark and lignite were also studied.  Using steam as fluidizing gas, the release of condensable organic compounds comprised 2% and 25% of peat, calculated on a dry ash-free basis, when drying peat for 0.5 s at 190 and 350-degrees-C, respectively.  The corresponding release of non-condensable gaseous components was 1% and 6% at these temperatures, and carbon dioxide accounted for over 70% of the total non-condensable gases.  The release of organic compounds at 250-degrees-C from peat was nearly four-fold and fifty-fold compared with that of bark and lignite, respectively.  The organic materials released from peat were mainly aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids (C1-C28), methanol, aliphatic aldehydes, anhydroglucoses and furanoic compounds.

AB Branched glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (bGDGTs) are known as bacterial lipids that occur widely in terrestrial environments, particularly in anaerobic peat bogs and soil. We examined the abundance and distribution of bGDGTs in both core (C) and polar (P) lipid fractions from the water column and surface sediments in the lower Pearl River (PR) and its estuary using two extraction methods (sonication vs. Bligh and Dyer). A number of soil samples in the lower PR drainage basin were also collected and extracted for bGDGTs using the sonication method. The results showed aquatic production of bGDGTs as supported by substantial abundances of P-bGDGTs in the water column and sediment samples. The bGDGT-based proxies (BIT, CBT, and MBT) were not affected by the method of extraction when C-bGDGTs were analyzed; in such case, the pH(CBT) of the sediments reflected the soil pH of the lower PR drainage basin, and the temperature close to the annual mean air temperature (MAT) in the lower PR basin. On the other hand, the P-bGDGT-derived proxies were inconsistent between the two methods. The P-bGDGTs (particularly those extracted using the sonication method) may not be reliable indicators of annual MATs.

AB Background and Aims The ecosystem engineers Sphagnum (peat mosses) are responsible for sequestering a large proportion of carbon in northern peatlands. Species may respond differently to hydrological changes, and water level changes may lead to vegetation shifts in peatlands, causing them to revert from sinks to sources of carbon. We aimed to compare species-specific responses to water level drawdown within Sphagnum, and investigate which traits affect water economy in this genus.
   Methods In a mesocosm experiment, we investigated how water level drawdown affected water content (WC) in the photosynthetically active apex of the moss and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (i.e. F-v/F-m) of 13 Sphagnum species. Structural traits were measured, and eight anatomical traits were quantified from scanning electron microscopy micrographs.
   Key Results Mixed-effects models indicated that at high water level, large leaves were the most influential predictor of high WC, and at low water level WC was higher in species growing drier in the field, with larger hyaline cell pore sizes and total pore areas associated with higher WC. Higher stem and peat bulk density increased WC, while capitulum mass per area and numerical shoot density did not. We observed a clear positive relationship between F-v/F-m and WC in wet-growing species.
   Conclusions While we found that most hummock species had a relatively high water loss resistance, we propose that some species are able to maintain a high WC at drawdown by storing large amounts of water at a high water level. Our result showing that leaf traits are important warrants further research using advanced morphometric methods. As climate change may lead to more frequent droughts and thereby water level drawdowns in peatlands, a mechanistic understanding of species-specific traits and responses is crucial for predicting future changes in these systems.

AB Concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in the atmosphere rose slowly during the millennia prior to the industrial era. Opposing explanations for these increases have invoked natural and anthropogenic sources. Here we revisit this argument using new evidence to see whether either explanation can be falsified (disproven, in the sense proposed by German philosopher Karl Popper). Two lines of evidence suggest that natural explanations for the CH4 increase are falsified: (1) the absence of any sustained methane increase early in seven interglaciations prior to the Holocene; and (2) weakening emissions during the last 5000 years from the two largest global sources of CH4 - north tropical and boreal wetlands. Consistent with this interpretation, a new synthesis of archeological data from southern Asia reported in this issue indicates an exponential increase in CH4 emissions from expanding rice irrigation during the last 5000 years. Neither the anthropogenic nor the natural explanations for the CO2 increase can at this point be falsified. Previous studies that rejected the early anthropogenic hypothesis based on the small size of early farming populations ignored a rich array of archeological and historical evidence showing that early farmers used much more land per capita than those in the centuries just before the industrial era. Previous interpretations of very small terrestrial (anthropogenic and other) carbon emissions during the last 7000 years based on the delta(CO2)-C-13 record failed to incorporate credible estimates of very large carbon burial in boreal peat lands during the late Holocene. Allowance for larger burial in peat deposits requires much greater emissions of anthropogenic carbon to balance the delta(CO2)-C-13 budget. The prevalence of downward CO2 trends during equivalent intervals early in previous interglaciations poses a major problem for natural explanations of the late-Holocene CO2 increase.

AB Water table depth (WTD) effects on net ecosystem CO2 exchange of boreal peatlands are largely mediated by hydrological effects on peat biogeochemistry and the eco-physiology of peatland vegetation. The lack of representation of these effects in carbon models currently limits our predictive capacity for changes in boreal peatland carbon deposits under potential future drier and warmer climates. We examined whether a process-level coupling of a prognostic WTD with (1) oxygen transport, which controls energy yields from microbial and root oxidation-reduction reactions, and (2) vascular and nonvascular plant water relations could explain mechanisms that control variations in net CO2 exchange of a boreal fen under contrasting WTD conditions, i.e., shallow vs. deep WTD. Such coupling of eco-hydrology and biogeochemistry algorithms in a process-based ecosystem model, ecosys, was tested against net ecosystem CO2 exchange measurements in a western Canadian boreal fen peatland over a period of drier-weather-driven gradual WTD drawdown. A May-October WTD drawdown of similar to 0.25m from 2004 to 2009 hastened oxygen transport to microbial and root surfaces, enabling greater microbial and root energy yields and peat and litter decomposition, which raised modeled ecosystem respiration (R-e) by 0.26 mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1) per 0.1m of WTD drawdown. It also augmented nutrient mineralization, and hence root nutrient availability and uptake, which resulted in improved leaf nutrient (nitrogen) status that facilitated carboxylation and raised modeled vascular gross primary productivity (GPP) and plant growth. The increase in modeled vascular GPP exceeded declines in modeled nonvascular (moss) GPP due to greater shading from increased vascular plant growth and moss drying from near-surface peat desiccation, thereby causing a net increase in modeled growing season GPP by 0.39 mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1) per 0.1m of WTD drawdown. Similar increases in GPP and Re caused no significant WTD effects on modeled seasonal and interannual variations in net ecosystem productivity (NEP). These modeled trends were corroborated well by eddy covariance measured hourly net CO2 fluxes (modeled vs. measured: R-2 similar to 0.8, slopes similar to 1 +/- 0.1, intercepts similar to 0: 05 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), hourly measured automated chamber net CO2 fluxes (modeled vs. measured: R-2 similar to 0: 7, slopes similar to 1 +/- 0.1, intercepts similar to 0.4 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), and other biometric and laboratory measurements. Modeled drainage as an analog for WTD drawdown induced by climate-change-driven drying showed that this boreal peatland would switch from a large carbon sink (NEP similar to 160 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) to carbon neutrality (NEP similar to 10 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) should the water table deepen by a further similar to 0.5 m. This decline in projected NEP indicated that a further WTD drawdown at this fen would eventually lead to a decline in GPP due to water limitation. Therefore, representing the effects of interactions among hydrology, biogeochemistry and plant physiological ecology on ecosystem carbon, water, and nutrient cycling in global carbon models would improve our predictive capacity for changes in boreal peatland carbon sequestration under changing climates.

AB We have examined how some major catchment disturbances may affect the aquatic greenhouse gas fluxes in the boreal zone, using gas flux data from studies made in 1994-1999 in the pelagic regions of seven lakes and two reservoirs in Finland. The highest pelagic seasonal average methane (CH4) emissions were up to 12 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from eutrophied lakes with agricultural catchments. Nutrient loading increases autochthonous primary production in lakes, promoting oxygen consumption and anaerobic decomposition in the sediments and this can lead to increased CH4 release from lakes to the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were higher from reservoirs and lakes whose catchment areas were rich in peatlands or managed forests, and from eutrophied lakes in comparison to oligotrophic and mesotrophic sites. However, all these sites were net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. The pelagic CH4 emissions were generally lower than those from the littoral zone. The fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) were negligible in the pelagic regions, apparently due to low nitrate inputs and/or low nitrification activity. However, the littoral zone, acting as a buffer for leached nitrogen, did release N2O. Anthropogenic disturbances of boreal lakes, such as increasing eutrophication, can change the aquatic greenhouse gas balance, but also the gas exchange in the littoral zone should be included in any assessment of the overall effect. It seems that autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources, which contribute to the CH4 and Co-2 production in lakes, also have importance in the greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs.

AB Boreal peatlands play a crucial role in global carbon cycling, acting as an important carbon reservoir. However, little information is available on how peatland microbial communities are influenced by natural variability or human-induced disturbances. In this study, we have investigated the fungal diversity and community structure of both the organic soil layer and buried wood in boreal forest soils using high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. We have also compared the fungal communities during the primary colonization of wood with those of the surrounding soils. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) confirmed that the community composition significantly differed between soil types (P< 0.001) and tree species (P< 0.001). The distance-based linear models analysis showed that environmental variables were significantly correlated with community structure (P< 0.04). The availability of soil nutrients (Ca [P = 0.002], Fe [P = 0.003], and P [P = 0.003]) within the site was an important factor in the fungal community composition. The species richness in wood was significantly lower than in the corresponding soil (P< 0.004). The results of the molecular identification were supplemented by fruiting body surveys. Seven of the genera of Agaricomycotina identified in our surveys were among the top 20 genera observed in pyrosequencing data. Our study is the first, to our knowledge, fungal high-throughput next-generation sequencing study performed on peatlands; it further provides a baseline for the investigation of the dynamics of the fungal community in the boreal peatlands.

AB Permafrost dynamics play an important role in the surface hydrology and carbon balance of northern peatlands. Plant macrofossil analysis with radiocarbon dating has been widely used in detecting past permafrost dynamics in peatlands; however, there is a lack of permafrost-specific plant indicator species, which makes it challenging to determine the exact timing of historical permafrost aggradation. We investigated the indicator value of oribatid mites in determining past permafrost dynamics in sub-Arctic peatlands. Analyses of subfossil oribatid mite assemblages of Holocene peat profiles from two mires, one in northern Finland and one in northeastern European Russia, were carried out and interpreted using modern calibration data from the same study areas. The results were compared with previously published reconstructions of permafrost history based on plant macrofossil analyses from the same locations. The results suggest that the oribatid mites Carabodes labyrinthicus, Chamobates borealis and Neoribates aurantiacus are promising indicator species to detect past permafrost occurrence in peatlands. In addition, N.aurantiacus is clearly associated with the presence of lichens, which is particularly useful because lichen remains are rarely preserved in peat deposits. Results are in accordance with earlier studies showing that oribatid mites are useful indicators of past environmental change.

AB Changes in the hydrological conditions of coastal wetlands may potentially affect the role of wetlands in the methane (CH4) cycle. In this study, the CH4 production potential and emissions from restored coastal reed wetlands at different water levels were examined in eastern China at a field scale in two phenological seasons. Results showed that the total CH4 flux from reeds at various water levels were positive, indicating that they were "sources" of CH4. During the peak growing season, CH4 flux from reeds was greater than that during the spring thaw. CH4 flux from reeds in inundated conditions was greater than that in non-inundated conditions. The CH4 production potential during the peak growing season was far greater than that during the spring thaw. However, the effect of water level on wetland CH4 production potential differed among seasons. The correlations among CH4 production potential, soil properties and CH4 flux change at different water level. These results demonstrate that water level was related to CH4 production and CH4 flux. The growing season also plays a role in CH4 fluxes. Controlling the hydrological environment in restored wetlands has important implications for the maintenance of their function as carbon sinks.

AB In boreal peatlands, low decomposition rate is the underlying cause of carbon sequestration. Decomposition of litter can be affected by factors relating to soil moisture and temperature, the quality of the litter, and by the biotic decomposer community, among others. Exploring how these drivers interact will provide better understanding of carbon dynamics in boreal peatlands. We measured the decomposition of three common peatland plant functional types (moss, sedge, shrub), and associated microarthropod communities using litterbags placed in hollows (wet depressions) and hummocks (dry, raised areas) of a boreal peatland in Ontario, Canada. Decomposition was significantly different between all plant litter types, and greatest in sedge, but was not significantly different between hummock and hollow microhabitats. The decomposer community displayed an opposite pattern, significantly affected by microhabitat where richness and abundance of microarthropods was greater in hollows than hummocks. Oribatid mites were the dominant microarthropod with respect to both richness and abundance. Plant litter type did not affect community structure in hollows, but was a determinant of oribatid dominance in hummocks. These results suggest that abiotic environmental conditions are the main drivers of community structure for decomposers, while plant litter quality is a more important determinant of decomposition dynamics in boreal peatlands.

AB Climate warming perturbs ecosystem carbon (C) cycling, causing both positive and negative feedbacks on greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, we began a tidal marsh field experiment in two vegetation communities to investigate the mechanisms by which whole-ecosystem warming alters C gain, via plant-driven sequestration in soils, and C loss, primarily via methane (CH4) emissions. Here, we report the results from the first 4 years. As expected, warming of 5.1 degrees C more than doubled CH4 emissions in both plant communities. We propose this was caused by a combination of four mechanisms: (i) a decrease in the proportion of CH4 consumed by CH4 oxidation, (ii) more C substrates available for methanogenesis, (iii) reduced competition between methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and (iv) indirect effects of plant traits. Plots dominated by Spartina patens consistently emitted more CH4 than plots dominated by Schoenoplectus americanus, indicating key differences in the roles these common wetland plants play in affecting anaerobic soil biogeochemistry and suggesting that plant composition can modulate coastal wetland responses to climate change.

AB Background: Peatlands play a key role in the global carbon cycle; these contain one third of the world's soil organic carbon, equivalent to more than half the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, these ecosystems have been scarcely studied in southern South America. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the recent accumulation rates of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in two kinds of oligotrofic peatlands in Isla Grande de Chiloe-Chile.
   Results: Using peat C and N content, dry bulk density, and Pb-210 dating, we determined the rates of N and C accumulation in profiles from five peatlands in the northern Chilean Patagonia. The recent rate of C accumulation (RERCA) ranges from 8.5 to 87.06 g C m(-2) year(-1), and the recent rate of N accumulation (RERNA) ranges from 0.15 to 2.37 g N m(-2) year(-1). The difference in RERCA and RERNA between glacial peatlands and anthropogenic peatlands was significant. One of the remarkable results is that accumulation of N and C are directly related.
   Conclusions: This study contributes for a better understanding of the Patagonian peatlands of Chile. In addition, this research contributes by setting a basis for conducting further studies and for assessing the impacts of climate change on peatlands.

AB Wetlands impact on the hydrological cycle, material transport, and biogeochemical processes, and they are indispensable habitats for valuable species. In the present study, the process-based National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model, which includes complex interactions between hydrologic, geomorphic, and ecological processes, was extended to incorporate coordinate transformation from rectangular coordinate to longitude-latitude coordinate system applicable to continental scale and the higher latitude region by implementing a map factor and a non-uniform grid. This revised model was applied to two different wetlands of northern Eurasia (West Siberian Lowland, and Hokkaido Island in Japan) to evaluate eco-hydrological processes in the higher latitude region. The model reproduced qualitatively the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater level in the flat region of both wetlands, and revealed the connectivity between groundwater and inundated flow in the flat region of the wetlands. This result also indicates the effectiveness of hypothesis that horizontal transport component is predominant as a first approximation. This new simulation system would be effective as one of the methods to expand a grid-based model to a broader area or the higher latitude region, and also would play an important role in the further understanding of biogeochemical activity in the higher latitude region along terrestrial-aquatic continuum in continental scale.

AB Soil organic matter distributions, reservoirs, and mineralization rates in tundra soils are important factors for understanding biogeochemical carbon cycling. This study focuses on spatial trends and environmental controls of soil carbon distribution and microbial soil respiration in 4 tundra vegetation communities in an arctic valley in NE-Greenland (74 degrees N), including Dryas and Cassiope heaths, Salix snow bed, and fen vegetation. Measured total soil organic carbon in the upper 50 cm averaged (-+/-SD) 11.0 +/- 1.5 kg C m(-2) with spatial variations strongly affected by vegetation, hydrology, and buried organic layers. Observed Soil CO2 concentrations and effluxes were simulated with a steady-state diffusion model using laboratory measured CO2 productions as input. Simulated CO2 profiles and CO2 effluxes (up to 3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) agreed with field observations and revealed the importance of both vegetation- and depth-specific CO2 production and CO2 diffusion for understanding the spatial variation in near-surface Soil CO2 gas dynamics. These results confirm that molecular diffusion dominates gas transport in the studied soils; but also that the complexity Of CO2 production/transport coupled to soil heterogeneity (in particular the litter layer) complicates the application of soil-diffusion models to estimate seasonal trends of soil gas effluxes.

AB Methane emissions from peatlands contribute significantly to atmospheric CH4 levels and play an essential role in the global carbon cycle. The stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-1(3)) of bacterial and plant lipids has been used to study modern and past peatland biogeochemistry, especially methane cycling. However, the small number of recent peatlands that have been characterised and the lack of consistency between target compounds means that this approach lacks a rigorous framework. Here, we undertake a survey of bacterial and plant lipid delta C-1(3) values in peatlands from different geographic regions, spanning a wide range of temperature (-8 to 27 degrees C) and pH (similar to 3 to 8), to generate a reference dataset and probe drivers of isotopic variability. Within our dataset, the carbon fixation pathway predominantly determines leaf wax (n-alkane) delta C-1(3) values. Bacterial-derived C-31 hopane delta C-1(3) values track those of leaf waxes but are relatively enriched (0 to 10%), indicating a heterotrophic ecology and preferential consumption of C-13-enriched substrates (e.g. carbohydrates). In contrast, <= C-30 hopanoids can be strongly C-13-depleted and indicate the incorporation of isotopically light methane into the bacterial community, especially at near neutral pH (similar to 5-6 pH). Previous analysis of Eocene sediments has suggested isotopic decoupling between C-31 and <= C-30 hopanoid delta C-1(3) values. Our work suggests a globally widespread decoupling in recent peatlands; this persists despite the profound diversity of hopanoid producing bacteria and associated controls on their delta C-1(3) values and it has significant implications for future work. Re-analysis of published data from: (1) the (mid-to-early) Holocene and late Glacial, and (2) latest Paleocene and earliest Eocene in this revised context highlights that perturbations to the peatland methane cycle occurred during the past, and we envisage that this approach could provide unique (qualitative) insights into methane cycling dynamics throughout the geological record.

AB Societies use material and energy resources to build up, maintain and utilize long-lasting structures such as buildings, infrastructures or machinery, i.e. entertain a 'social metabolism'. Nexus approaches provide useful heuristics for interdisciplinary analyses of (un)sustainable society-nature interactions, for example by highlighting relations between different resources (e.g. land, water and energy). Assuming that social metabolism is mainly motivated by the aim of deriving benefits from products or services leads to the concept of a 'stock-flowservice nexus'. This nexus approach connects biophysical stocks and flows involved in social metabolism to the services, benefits and well-being contributions they provide to society. It thus reaches beyond narrower concepts of 'eco-efficiency'. At the same time, it remains mired in controversy over the valuation of services. The complementary approach of a 'stock-flow-practice nexus' is focused on the relationships between stocks, flows and practices, i.e. the routines of everyday life linked with resource use. Building on prominent theories of practice, in particular those that have gained traction in consumption research, it avoids controversies around the service concept and offers a fresh perspective on structure-agency issues at the heart of social metabolism. In this conceptual article, we discuss how these two complementary nexus approaches can serve as heuristic models for interdisciplinary sustainability research and sketch the different conceptual and empirical research directions each of these two approaches inspires.

AB We studied natural and forestry-drained peatlands to examine the effect of over 34 years lowered water table on the delta C-13 values of vegetation, bulk peat and subsoil. In the seven studied sites, delta C-13 in the basal peat layer was 1.1 and 1.2 parts per thousand lower than that of the middle-layer and surface layer, respectively. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the delta C-13 values of the basal and surface peat layers, possibly due to carbon (C) recycling within the peat column. In the same mire complex, natural fen peat delta C-13 values were lower than those of the nearby bog, possibly due to the dominance of vascular plants on fen and the generally larger share of recycled C in the fens than in the bogs. Furthermore, natural and 51 years previously drained fen and bog, on the opposite sides of a ditch on the same mire complex, showed no significant differences in delta C-13 values. Plant delta C-13 values were lower, while delta C-13 values of subsoil were higher in the drained than in the natural site of the fen.

Thaw will lead to dramatic changes in vegetation, and an understanding of the patterns and rates of succession following thaw is important for assessing future ecosystem changes, such as carbon accumulation and the likelihood of permafrost formation during climate warming. This paper describes the autogenic processes of peat accumulation and succession from recently thawed, aquatic Sphagnum communities to lawn and hummock Sphagnum communities favorable for permafrost formation. Peat cores were used to construct bulk density profiles in aquatic, lawn, and hummock habitats. Soil bulk density increased over time from the edges to the centers of thawed bogs. These changes corresponded to changes from aquatic to lawn/hummock communities. Macrofossils from Pb-210-dated peat cores were used to document historical changes to hummock communities. Succession to hummock communities capable of forming permafrost was less than 80 years. Picea mariana seedlings colonized emergent Sphagnum hummocks in collapse scars, which may lead to permafrost formation. However, permafrost formation in today's discontinuous permafrost landscape is unlikely during future climate warming because of limited tree establishment and shifting mean annual temperature isotherms.

AB 1 CO2 emissions in boreal peatlands were measured during two seasons on various mire site types representing different nutrient statuses and water tables. In order to examine the long term effects of water table draw-down on the CO2 fluxes, the sites also included 25-50-year-old drainages.
   2 On virgin sites the lowest CO2 fluxes were measured at ombrotrophic sites dominated by Sphagnum fuscum (78-127 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C, 60-200 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)) and the highest CO2 fluxes were at ombrotrophic sites with abundant understorey vegetation (183-259 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C, 290-340 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1)).
   3 Lowering of the water table by 1 cm increased CO2 fluxes by an average of 7.1 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at 12 degrees C and 9.5g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1). In some cases the effect of ditches on the water table, and correspondingly on CO2 fluxes, was small. However, effective draining caused approximate to 100% increase in CO2 fluxes. Drainages had higher CO2 fluxes compared with virgin subsites at the same temperature and water table.
   4 The effect of temperature on CO2 fluxes depended on the water table, the average Q(10) value being 2.9 with water tables of 0-20 cm and 2.0 with water tables below 20 cm.
   5 CO2 fluxes are compared with primary production figures, and peat carbon stores and the carbon balance in changing climate are discussed.

AB Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured in a cool temperate peatland in northwestern Turkey on a continuous basis using eddy covariance (EC) sensors and multiple (non-)linear regression-M(N)LR-models. Our results showed that hourly NEE varied between -1.26 and 1.06 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1), with a mean value of 0.11 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Nighttime ecosystem respiration (R-E) was on average measured as 0.23 +/- 0.09 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Two best-fit M(N)LR models estimated daytime R-E as 0.64 +/- 0.31 and 0.24 +/- 0.05 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Total R-E as the sum of nighttime and daytime RE ranged from 0.47 to 0.87 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1), thus yielding estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) at -0.35 +/- 0.18 and -0.74 +/- 0.43 mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Use of EC sensors and M(N) LR models is one of the most direct ways to quantify turbulent CO2 exchanges among the soil, vegetation and atmosphere within the atmospheric boundary layer, as well as source and sink behaviors of ecosystems.

AB Fine roots contribute to ecosystem carbon, water, and nutrient fluxes through resource acquisition, respiration, exudation, and turnover, but are understudied in peatlands. We aimed to determine how the amount and timing of fine-root growth in a forested, ombrotrophic bog varied across gradients of vegetation density, peat microtopography, and changes in environmental conditions across the growing season and throughout the peat profile.
   We quantified fine-root peak standing crop and growth using non-destructive minirhizotron technology over a two-year period, focusing on the dominant woody species in the bog: Picea mariana, Larix laricina, Rhododendron groenlandicum, and Chamaedaphne calyculata.
   The fine roots of trees and shrubs were concentrated in raised hummock microtopography, with more tree roots associated with greater tree densities and a unimodal peak in shrub roots at intermediate tree densities. Fine-root growth tended to be seasonally dynamic, but shallowly distributed, in a thin layer of nutrient-poor, aerobic peat above the growing season water table level.
   The dynamics and distribution of fine roots in this forested ombrotrophic bog varied across space and time in response to biological, edaphic, and climatic conditions, and we expect these relationships to be sensitive to projected environmental changes in northern peatlands.

AB The carbon sink function of peatlands is the result of a relatively small imbalance between biomass production and decay and proposed to be sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Thus, peat decomposition plays a decisive role in determining the future carbon balances of peatlands under changing climatic conditions and increasing human pressure. To evaluate the effects of peatland degradation on the degree of decomposition in light of deviating site histories and to reveal interrelations between different indicators, we analysed peat depth profiles of physicochemical peat decomposition proxies across nine study sites in two valley bogs in the Eastern Alps, Austria. For this purpose, we divided 1 m peat cores sampled at the nine sites into 4 cm sections and analysed these peat samples for bulk density, loss on ignition, pH value, carbon and nitrogen content and ratio, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures, and five humification indices based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Besides, we regularly measured water levels and incubated litter bags over two years. Peat characteristics were found to be relatively homogenous across the treeless and only slightly degraded sites. At these sites, depth profiles followed similar patterns with strongly increasing decomposition in the uppermost layers and the highest degree of peat decomposition at 40-56 cm depths for most proxies. Thus, our findings suggest that even apparently only slightly degraded sites were distinctly affected by past drainages. In contrast to the open peat bog sites, the degree in peat decomposition was distinctly higher at tree-encroached sites and at long-term drained former peat-cutting sites. Both, the distinct difference in the degree of decomposition between the two peatlands and the inverse decomposition depth trends, i.e., more decomposed peat overlying less decomposed layers, highlight the importance of secondary decomposition on the depth profiles and the strong effects of site histories on the current degree of peat decomposition. The results of two-year litter bag incubations of four vascular plant species revealed distinct differences in species-specific litter decomposition rates and considerable differences for same species between the two investigated bogs. The strong interrelations between different humification indices underline the simultaneous effects of proceeding decay on the different chemical properties of the peat. Besides, humification indices were strongly related with other physical and chemical properties of peats and highest loadings on the principal component 1 that accounted for 41% of the total variance of the dataset were found for four different humification indices, bulk density and nitrogen contents. We conclude that the selective preservation of aliphatic, acid and aromatic groups during peat decomposition are well suited to elucidate small-scale differences in the degree of decomposition and to strongly interrelate with established indicators as bulk densities.

AB (1) Huge reductions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) effluxes can be attained by rewetting drained peatlands, but this will increase methane (CH4) effluxes.
   (2) The scientific data base for methane effluxes from peatlands is much larger than that for CO2 or N2O. Once anoxic conditions are provided, the availability of fresh plant material is the major factor in methane production. Old (recalcitrant) peat plays only a subordinate role in gas efflux.
   (3) The annual mean water level is a surprisingly good indicator for methane effluxes, but at high water levels the cover of aerenchymous shunts (gas conductive plant tissue) becomes a better proxy. Ideally, both water level and cover of aerenchymous shunts should be assessed to arrive at robust estimates of methane effluxes.
   (4) The available data provide sufficient guidance for arriving at moderately accurate (Tier 1) estimates consistent with IPCC methodologies. For more accurate estimation (higher tier approaches), vegetation provides a promising basis for development of more detailed efflux factors. Vegetation is a good proxy for mean water levels and can provide - with extra attention to aerenchymous shunts - a robust proxy for accurate and spatially explicit estimates of methane effluxes over large areas.

AB Recent work has highlighted the ubiquity of bacteria and archaea and continues to affirm their significance in diverse biogeochemical processes. The delta(13)C values and distributions of diagnostic lipids derived from such microorganisms can provide insights into prokaryotic processes in modem settings and are one of the few means by which past prokaryotic processes in depositional settings can be elucidated. Here we present a brief review of prokaryotic lipids commonly observed in sediments and the controls on their carbon isotopic compositions. We then present two case studies-one of Mediterranean cold seeps at which anaerobic oxidation of methane occurs and one of a Holocene peat deposit in which a variety of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms govern the degradation of organic matter. These two studies illustrate the potential utility of compound-specific carbon isotope analyses to deconvolute pathways of carbon flow in microbial communities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB An important advance in the radiocarbon dating of archaeological material occurred in the late 1990s, with direct dating of cremated human remains. A crucial part of the argument was the demonstration that comparable results could be obtained from paired dates of charcoal and calcined bone from the same contexts. Recent studies, however, have noted the influence of carbon from the fuel sources, raising a question over the interpretation of the paired charcoal/bone dates. Here, fleshed modern animal joints were burned with "old" fuel of known age, providing experimental evidence under natural conditions, demonstrating a clear effect of the fuel source on the carbon isotopic composition of calcined bone. In most situations in which branchwood was used as fuel, dates on calcined bone should not show any significant offset, as the wood will be of a similar age to the cadaver. For cases in which old wood, coal, or peat are used as fuel, we expect an offset of some decades/centuries, potentially up to millennia. We observed, however, that the amount of C-14 intake from the fuel is extremely variable (from 39 to 95%). A strong correlation between age offset and delta C-13 values suggests that the latter might be useful in identifying large inputs from C-14-depleted fuels. A level of caution is recommended when C-14 dating calcined bone in cases where fuels with an inbuilt age may have been used in the cremation process.

AB Freshwater marshes are prevalent in North America, yet their soil carbon stocks remain poorly quantified. To better understand these stocks, and rates of carbon accumulation over short and long timescales, we synthesize available data on soil properties and rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes in the temperate region of North America. Our findings suggest that freshwater marshes are not defined consistently, and that wetland classification schemes may undervalue presumed carbon stocks in freshwater marsh soils. Rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes are often measured over recent time scales (last 50-100 years); these short-term rates are on average (+/- SD) 155 +/- 74 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in temperate North America. Long-term rates of carbon accumulation (measured over centuries and millennia) are on average 51 +/- 38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) yet infrequently measured. Our synthesis of rates of carbon accumulation and vertical accretion, bulk densities, and organic carbon contents suggests that freshwater marshes are accumulating carbon at comparable rates to salt marshes over short timescales and temperate peatlands over longer timescales. These timescales need to be clearly defined in order to improve estimates of the capacity for freshwater marshes to be net carbon sinks presently and in the future.

ID RELEASE; EROSION; EXPORTS; METALS; BUDGET
AB This study investigates for the first time the relative importance of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in the fluvial carbon flux from an actively eroding peatland catchment in the southern Pennines, UK. Event scale variability in DOC and POC was examined and the annual flux of fluvial organic carbon was estimated for the catchment. At the event scale, both DOC and POC were found to increase with discharge, with event based POC export accounting for 95% of flux in only 8% of the time. On an annual cycle, exports of 35.14 t organic carbon (OC) are estimated from the catchment, which represents an areal value of 92.47 g C m(-2) a(-1). POC was the most significant form of organic carbon export, accounting for 80% of the estimated flux. This suggests that more research is required on both the fate of POC and the rates of POC export in eroding peatland catchments.

AB Sphagnum peatlands host a high abundance of pronsts, especially testate amoebae. Here, we designed a study to investigate the functional diversity of testate amoebae in relation to wetness and forest cover in Baltic bogs. We provided new data on the influence of openness/wetness gradient on testate amoebae communities, showing significant differences in selected testate amoebae (TA) traits. Three key messages emerged from our investigations: 1) we recorded an effect of peatland surface openness on testate amoebae functional traits that led us to accept the hypothesis that TA traits differ according to light intensity and hydrology. Mixotrophic species were recorded in high relative abundance in open plots, whereas they were nearly absent in forested sites; 2) we revealed a hydrological threshold for the occurrence of mixotrophic testate amoebae that might be very important in terms of peatland functioning and carbon sink vs. source context; and 3) mixotrophic species with organic tests were nearly absent in forested sites that, were dominated by heterotrophic species with agglutinated or idiosomic tests. An important message from this study is that taxonomy of rather indicates the hydrological gradient whereas traits of mixotrophs the openness gradient. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Peatland water table depth is an important control on runoff production, plant growth and carbon cycling. Many peatlands have been drained but are now subject to activities that might lead to their restoration including the damming of artificial drains. This paper investigates water table dynamics on intact, drained and restored peatland slopes in a blanket peat in northern England using transects of automated water table recorders. Long-term (18 month), seasonal and short-term (storm event) records are explored. The restored site had drains blocked 6 years prior to monitoring commencing. The spatially-weighted mean water table depths over an 18 month period were -5.8 cm, -8.9 cm and -11.5 cm at the intact, restored and drained sites respectively. Most components of water table behaviour at the restored site, including depth exceedance probability curves, seasonality of water table variability, and water table responses to individual rainfall events were intermediate between that of the drained and intact sites. Responses also depended on location with respect to the drains. The results show that restoration of drained blanket peat is difficult and the water table dynamics may not function in the same way as those in undisturbed blanket peat even many years after management intervention. Further measurement of hydrological processes and water table responses to peatland restoration are required to inform land managers of the hydrological success of those projects.

AB Wetland biogeochemistry is strongly influenced by water and temperature dynamics, and these interactions are currently poorly represented in ecosystem and climate models. A decline in water table of approximately 30 cm was observed at a wetland in Northern Wisconsin, USA over a period from 2001-2007, which was highly correlated with an increase in daily soil temperature variability. Eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange were compared with measured CO2 fluxes at two nearby forests in order to distinguish wetland effects from regional trends. As wetland water table declined, both ecosystem respiration and ecosystem production increased by over 20% at the wetland, while forest CO2 fluxes had no significant trends. Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide at the wetland was not correlated with water table, but wetland evapotranspiration decreased substantially as the water table declined. These results suggest that changes in hydrology may not have a large impact on shrub wetland carbon balance over inter-annual time scales due to opposing responses in both ecosystem respiration and productivity.

AB Research on the ecosystem impacts of acidifying pollutants, and measures to control them, has focused almost exclusively on sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) compounds. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), although emitted by coal burning, has been overlooked as a driver of ecosystem change because most of it was considered to redeposit close to emission sources rather than in remote natural ecosystems. Despite receiving little regulatory attention, measures to reduce S emissions, and changes in energy supply, have led to a 95% reduction in United Kingdom HCl emissions within 20 years. Long-term precipitation, surface water, and soil solution data suggest that the near-disappearance of HCl from deposition could account for 30-40% of chemical recovery from acidification during this time, affecting both near-source and remote areas. Because HCl is highly mobile in reducing environments, it is a more potent acidifier of wetlands than S or N, and HCl may have been the major driver of past peatland acidification. Reduced HCl loadings could therefore have affected the peatland carbon cycle, contributing to increases in dissolved organic carbon leaching to surface waters. With many regions increasingly reliant on coal for power generation, HCl should be recognized as a potentially significant constituent of resulting emissions, with distinctive ecosystem impacts.

AB Simple models are less input demanding and their calibration involves a lower number of parameters, however their general applicability to vast areas must be tested. We analysed if a simple ecosystem model (PRELES) can be applied to estimate carbon and water fluxes of Boreal forests at regional scale.
   Multi-site (M-S) and site-specific (S-S) calibrations were compared using evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) measurements from 10 sites. The performances of M-S were similar to S-Ss except for a site with agricultural history. Although PRELES predicted GPP better than ET, we concluded that the model can be reliably used at regional scale to simulate carbon and water fluxes of Boreal forests.
   We further found that, in the calibration, the use of a long and carefully collected flux dataset from one site that covers a wide range of climate variability leads to better model performance in other sites as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil carbon decomposition in an experimental anaerobic wetland system. Pots containing either bare C-4-derived soil or the C-3 sedge Scirpus olneyi planted in C-4-derived soil were incubated in greenhouse chambers at either ambient or twice-ambient atmospheric CO2. We measured CO2 flux from each pot, quantified soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization using delta C-13, and determined root and shoot biomass. SOM mineralization increased in response to elevated CO2 by 83-218% (P < 0.0001). In addition, soil redox potential was significantly and positively correlated with root biomass (P = 0.003). Our results (1) show that there is a positive feedback between elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and wetland SOM decomposition and (2) suggest that this process is mediated by the release of oxygen from the roots of wetland plants. Because this feedback may occur in any wetland system, including peatlands, these results suggest a limitation on the size of the carbon sink presented by anaerobic wetland soils in a future elevated-CO2 atmosphere.

AB For more than a decade, scientists have argued about the warmth of the current interglaciation. Was the warmth of the preindustrial late Holocene natural in origin, the result of orbital changes that had not yet driven the system into a new glacial state? Or was it in considerable degree the result of humans intervening in the climate system through greenhouse gas emissions from early agriculture? Here we summarize new evidence that moves this debate forward by testing both hypotheses. By comparing late Holocene responses to those that occurred during previous interglaciations (in section 2), we assess whether the late Holocene responses look different (and thus anthropogenic) or similar (and thus natural). This comparison reveals anomalous (anthropogenic) signals. In section 3, we review paleoecological and archaeological syntheses that provide ground truth evidence on early anthropogenic releases of greenhouse gases. The available data document large early anthropogenic emissions consistent with the anthropogenic ice core anomalies, but more information is needed to constrain their size. A final section compares natural and anthropogenic interpretations of the C-13 trend in ice core CO2.

AB Equations based on empirical relationships of peat physical properties were used to estimate the average long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) in Finnish mire vegetation regions. The results were generalized to the boreal and subarctic regions. Analyses of 1302 dated peat cores were used to infer carbon accumulation for each mire vegetation region of Finland. The area-weighted LORCA for Finnish undrained mire areas was 18.5 g m(-2) yr(-1) and the total carbon sink 0.79 Tg yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12)g). The total carbon pool of Finnish undrained mires was estimated as 2257 Tg. The aapa-mire region included 80% of the total net accumulation rate of carbon and 85% of the total carbon reservoirs of Finnish undrained mires. LORCA was significantly higher in the raised-bog region, 26.1 g m(-2) yr(-1), compared with the aapa-mire region, 17.3 g m(-2) yr(-1), and bogs generally had a higher LORCA 20.8 g m(-2) yr(-1), than fens 16.9 g m(-2) yr(-1). The total C sink for boreal and subarctic mires was estimated at 66 Tg yr(-1) which is about 31% lower than the previous estimates. The total C pool of all boreal and subarctic mires was estimated at 270-370 Pg (1 Pg = 10(15)g).

AB Early peat surveys demonstrated the potential to detect Holocene climatic changes in southern Sweden through analysis of the degree of decomposition of Sphagnum peat and motivated systematic collection of peat-strati graphic information during subsequent geological mappings in central and northern Sweden. The resulting (published and unpublished) data was compiled and reanalysed, taking into account unpublished radiocarbon data and developments in radiocarbon calibration and pollen-stratigraphic dating. Data from 61 carefully selected sites indicate a peat initiation maximum centred in the north 9500-8000 cal. BP and interpreted to primarily reflect climatic change. The cause for a secondary maximum 6000-5500 cal. BP centred further south is less clear. Peat deposition data show a continuous increase in the period 10 500-2000 cal. BP, with almost constant values during recent millennia, indicating that peatlands in the region acted as a long-term Holocene carbon sink and increasingly so until c. 2000 years ago. Sphagnum peat decomposition data display a long-term trend towards wetter conditions after 5000 cal. BP interpreted to primarily reflect progressively stronger westerly airflow and an accompanying increase in precipitation. These data also show that wet shifts occurred more frequently across the region around 3300, 2500-2100 and 1300 cal. BP. The timing of peak frequencies of wet shifts is similar to that of supposedly climate-related wet shifts identified in southern Sweden. Variability in frequency of wet shifts is most strongly pronounced in the south-west, with an apparent periodicity of 800-1000 years believed to reflect regular changes in westerly airflow during the mid and late Holocene.

AB To evaluate the effect of vegetation change on greenhouse gas (GHG) budget from a wetland ecosystem, the CO2, CH4 and N2O budgets from whole area (21.5 ha) of the Bibai Wetland, where dwarf bamboo (Sasa) or Ilex has invaded into original Sphagnum dominated vegetation, located in Hokkaido, Japan were estimated. The original Sphagnum-dominated vegetation was changed from a sink to a source of CO2 by invasion of short-Sasa (50 cm > height), while the invasion of tall-Sasa (50 cm < height < 150 cm) or Ilex increased CO2 uptake. Annual CH4 emission was decreased by the invasion of Sasa or Ilex. The annual N2O emission was slightly increased by invasion of Ilex only. These GHG budgets were correlated with the environmental factors related to the water table depth. The distribution of vegetation and environmental factors was estimated from satellite image bands, and the GHG budget of the entire wetland was estimated. The whole wetland area was considered to be a sink for GHG (-113 Mg CO2-eq y(-1)) and CO2 uptake by tall-Sasa occupied 71% of the GHG budget. The vegetation change due to the lowering of the water table depth currently increases the rate of carbon accumulation in the ecosystem by about 5 times.

AB During past decades, great attention has been paid to propagation of endangered plant taxa in order to preserve biodiversity. The aim of this study was to optimize a protocol for in vitro propagation of the critically endangered and decorative species Dianthus serotinus Waldst. et Kit. The effects of different concentration of MS salt (Murashige and Skoog) of the culture, medium pH and different carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) on shoot multiplication were examined. The best results were obtained on half-strength MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium, whose pH was 5.8, with sucrose supplied at a concentration of 3%, when shoots with 1-2 nodes or shoot tips (with terminal buds only) were used as explants. The shoots were rooted (76.7%) on half-strength MS medium containing 0.5 mg.L-1 NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid). The obtained plandets were successfully acclimatized (89%) in a 4:1 mixture of peat and sand and they flowered the following year. Presented protocol enables successful in vitro propagation of D. serotinus.

AB Drained organic soils are among the most risky soil types as far as their greenhouse gas emissions are considered. Reed canary grass (RCG) is a potential bioenergy crop in the boreal region, but the atmospheric impact of its cultivation is unknown. The fluxes of N2O and CH4 were measured from an abandoned peat extraction site (an organic soil) cultivated with RCG using static chamber and snow gradient techniques. The fluxes were measured also at an adjacent site which is under active peat extraction and it is devoid of any vegetation (BP site). The 4-year average annual N2O emissions were low being 0.1 and 0.01 g N2O m(-2) a(-1) at the RCG and BP sites, respectively. The corresponding mean annual CH4 emissions from the RCG and BP sites were also low (0.4 g and 0.9 g CH4 m(-2) a(-1)). These results highlight for the first time that there are organic soils where cultivation of perennial bioenergy crops is possible with low N2O and CH4 emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We analyzed the relationship between net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) and irradiance (as photosynthetic photon flux density or PPFD), using published and unpublished data that have been collected during midgrowing season for carbon balance studies at seven peatlands in North America and Europe. NEE measurements included both eddy-correlation tower and clear, static chamber methods, which gave very similar results. Data were analyzed by site, as aggregated data sets by peatland type (bog, poor fen, rich fen, and all fens) and as a single aggregated data set for all peatlands. In all cases, a fit with a rectangular hyperbola (NEE = alpha PPFD P-max/(alpha PPFD + P-max) + R) better described the NEE-PPFD relationship than did a linear fit (NEE = beta PPFD + R). Poor and rich fens generally had similar NEE-PPFD relationships, while bogs had lower respiration rates (R = -2.0 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) for bogs and -2.7 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) for fens) and lower NEE at moderate and high light levels (P-max = 5.2 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) for bogs and 10.8 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) for fens). As a single class, northern peatlands had much smaller ecosystem respiration (R = -2.4 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) and NEE rates (alpha = 0.020 and P-max = 9.2 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) than the upland ecosystems (closed canopy forest, grassland, and cropland) summarized by Ruimy et al. [1995]. Despite this low productivity, northern peatland soil carbon pools are generally 5-50 times larger than upland ecosystems because of slow rates of decomposition caused by litter quality and anaerobic, cold soils.

AB The thawing of ice-rich permafrost soils in northern peatlands leads to the formation of thermokarst ponds, surrounded by organic-rich soils. These aquatic ecosystems are sites of intense microbial activity, and CO2 and CH4 emissions. Many of the pond systems in northern landscapes and their surrounding peatlands are hydrologically contiguous, but little is known about the microbial connectivity of concentric habitats around the thermokarst ponds, or the effects of peat accumulation and infilling on the microbial communities. Here we investigated microbial community structure and abundance in a thermokarst pond-peatland system in subarctic Canada. Several lineages were ubiquitous, supporting a prokaryotic continuum from the thermokarst pond to surrounding peatlands. However, the microbial community structure shifted from typical aerobic freshwater microorganisms (Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) in the pond towards acidophilic and anaerobic lineages (Acidobacteria and Choroflexi) in the connected peatland waters, likely selected by the acidification of the water by Sphagnum mosses. Marked changes in abundance and community composition of methane cycling microorganisms were detected along the thermokarst pond-peatland transects, suggesting fine tuning of C-1 carbon cycling within a highly connected system, and warranting the need for higher spatial resolution across the thermokarst landscape to accurately predict net greenhouse gas emissions from northern peatlands.

AB Radiocarbon isotopes are increasingly being used to investigate the age and source of carbon released from peatlands. Here we use combined C-14 and delta C-13 measurements to determine the isotopic composition of soil and soil decomposition products [dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2 and CH4] in a peatland-riparian-stream transect, to establish the isotopic signature and potential connectivity between carbon pools. Sampling was conducted during two time periods in 2012 to investigate processes under different temperature, hydrological and flux conditions. Isotopic differences existed in the peatland and riparian zone soil organic matter as a result of the riparian depositional formation. The peatland had a mean radiocarbon age of 551 +/- A 133 years BP, with age increasing with depth, and delta C-13 values consistent with C3 plant material as the primary source. In contrast the riparian zone had a much older radiocarbon age of 1,055 +/- A 107 years BP and showed no age/depth relationship; delta C-13 in the riparian zone was also consistent with C3 plant material. With the exception of DOC in September, soil decomposition products were predominately > 100 %modern with C-14 values consistent with derivation from organic matter fixed in the previous 5 years. Emissions of CO2 and CH4 from the soil surface were also modern. In contrast, CO2 and CH4 evaded from the stream surface was older (CH4: 310-537 years BP, CO2: 36 years BP to modern) and contained a more complex mix of sources combining soil organic matter and geogenic carbon. The results suggest considerable vertical transport of modern carbon to depth within the soil profile. The importance of modern recently fixed carbon and the differences between riparian and stream isotopic signatures suggests that the peatland (not the riparian zone) is the most important source of carbon to stream water.

AB In-situ oil extraction activities impact the vast mosaic of boreal wetlands and uplands. Peatland restoration in these regions aims at reestablishing crucial peatland functions, such as peat accumulation and carbon (C) sequestration. In order to assess the success of fen restoration, we evaluated the biogeochemical conditions, the seasonal carbon balances via carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and methane (CH4) emissions, and addressed the global warming potential following different restoration techniques at two restored in-situ oil sands well pads, during two consecutive growing seasons. Restoration work involved: 1) the partial or complete removal of introduced well pad construction materials, and spontaneous revegetation, or 2) the partial removal of foreign clay, in addition to reintroduction of typical fen plant species such as Larix laricina, Salix lutea and Carex aquatilis. Comparisons were done with regional reference ecosystems (REF) consisting of three peatlands: a wooded bog, a wooded rich fen and a wooded extreme-rich fen. While the average electric conductivity of restored sectors (946 mu S cm(-1)) was higher compared to REF (360 mu S cm(-1)), the pH was quite similar (pH 5.8 REF, pH 6 restored). Dissolved organic carbon concentration was lower in all restored sectors (5-11 mg L-1 restored sectors, 15-35 mg L-1 REF), presumably due to the still incomplete recovery of vegetation and lower organic matter content associated with remnant well pad material. Re-establishment of shrub and brown moss species improved significantly the C uptake. However, the active introduction of plant species was no crucial restoration step, in order to return species beneficial for C uptake. Restoration treatments that were leveled closest to the surrounding REF showed the most similar seasonal C balance to REF. In shallow open water areas resulting from the complete removal of all construction materials, we measured the highest methane emissions making these flooded sites net C sources to the atmosphere with elevated global warming potential. The partial removal of the well pad's mineral soil to near the water table level and the surface elevation of the surrounding ecosystem seems to be the most effective site management method to sequester carbon efficiently. However, further research is needed to evaluate the suitability of this restoration method for the recovery of biodiversity and possible impacts of residual foreign materials on fen ecosystems.

AB Wetland ecosystems are a major natural source of the important greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Among these ecosystems, fens have been shown to release high quantities of CH4. Data on CH4 emissions from alpine fens are scarce and mainly limited to the United States and China. Therefore, static chambers were used to quantify CH4 emissions from 14 fens located in the Swiss Alps. The aims of this study were to determine the spatial variability of the emissions and to identify potential key factors which influence CH4 turnover. The fens were located at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,600 m a.s.l., the pore water varied from acidic to slightly acidic (pH 4.5-6.4) and the vegetation was dominated by plants of the genus Carex. In addition, the underlying bedrock was either siliceous or calcareous. Methane emissions ranged from 74 +/- A 43 to 711 +/- A 212 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1). The type of bedrock, the plant biomass above the water table and the CH4 pore water concentrations at depths from 0 to 20 cm were the main factors influencing CH4 emissions. Detailed measurements in three selected fens suggested that more than 98 % of the total CH4 emissions are due to plant-mediated transport.

AB Drained agricultural peat soils are significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) but also small sinks for methane (CH4). Leaving these soils without any cultivation practice could be an option to mitigate GHG emissions. To test this hypothesis, we measured, over a three year period, net CO2 exchange and fluxes of CH4 for five agricultural peat soils that had been abandoned for 20-30 years. Annually, the sites were either small net sinks or sources of CO2 and CH4 (-7.8 to 530 g CO2-C m(-2) and -0.41 to 1.8 g CH4 m(-2)). Including N2O emissions from our previous study, the net (CH4 + CO2 + N2O) emissions as CO2 equivalents were lower than in cultivated peat soils and were lowest in the wet year. Therefore, high GHG emissions from these soils could be avoided if the water table is maintained close to the soil surface when photosynthesis is favoured over respiration.

AB Data on the distributed dynamics of water table elevation (WTE) and on the variation of water discharge are needed for calculation of the carbon balances of entire mire complexes. Here we describe the development of a high-resolution transient hydrological model for the extensive boreal bog complex at Mukhrino in West Siberia (Asian Russia). The model, developed in PCRaster-MODFLOW, outputs spatially distributed WTE and daily water fluxes in 3D. It incorporates snowmelt dynamics and temporal freezing of the upper peat layer. During the period 2008-2016 snowmelt occurred during 2-4 weeks per year and accounted for 30 % of the total volume of water available for recharge and evapotranspiration. The calibrated hydraulic conductivity of the acrotelm was 0.6-1.2 cm s(-1). Model outputs indicated that the annual amplitude of WTE variation was 10-20 cm, in agreement with on-site measurements. Snowmelt raised the water table by 5-10 cm at the water divide and by 10-20 cm near the margin of the bog. In the ridge-hollow complex on the mire expanse, 91% of all spring water fluxes discharged through the acrotelm in hollows, whereas the ridges retarded runoff. Based on modelled water fluxes and measurements of DOC we estimated that the organic carbon (DOC) export from the bog complex was 7.7 g m(-2) y(-1).

AB The Hindu-Kush Himalaya region extends over 4 million km(2) across the eight countries. Knowingly, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is considered the principal altitudinal permafrost constituent on earth and is deemed as the third 'pole'. Among which, the Zoige wetlands are located in the northeastern boundary of QTP, wrapping a total area of 6180 km(2) with an average altitude of 3500 m. This entire region is the hotspot for methane emission since the last decade. Given the importance of methane emission, many studies have focused on the effect of environmental fluctuations on the overall methane profile and, more recently on the methanogenic community structure. The current review summarizes recent advancements of the methanogenic community and methane profile and outlines a framework for better understanding of the microbial ecology of the Zoige wetlands, China. Moreover, as microorganisms are indispensable to biogeochemical cycles, especially for methane, they are believed to be the best indicators to identify the condition of wetlands. Hence, we suggest that, underpinning the microbial profile could help understand the status of a wetland. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A large quantity of carbon (C) storage in peatland soils plays an important role in global C cycling. Microbial resource limitation and environmental factors can drive C cycling. However, the microbial resource limitation and regulator of C cycling in such an ecosystem are debated and still unclear. Therefore, this study chose Zoige, the largest peatland in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, to identify microbial resource limitation by analyzing ecoenzymatic stoichiometry and the regulation of soil organic C (SOC) through the interrelationships correlating SOC to abiotic (soil properties) and biotic factors (ecoenzyme activities, microbial communities, and abundance). The results demonstrated that soil microbial resource limitation varied in different seasons, across peatland types, and with depths; SOC content was more affected by abiotic factors (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, Olsen-phosphorus, moisture content) than biotic factors at the regional scale, and the factors driving C cycling differed among peatland types at the subregional scale. The path analysis further emphasized the importance of abiotic factors in C cycling, especially total nitrogen. This study provides important information for the understanding regulator of C cycling in peatland soils, which may help mitigate global climate change.

AB 1. The aim of the study was to investigate effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on the balance between biomass production and decay in an ombrotrophic bog which is dominated by one species of Sphagnum (S. fuscum). This paper concerns production.
   2. Enhanced W-B radiation (simulating 15% ozone depletion under clear sky conditions) was applied by means of fluorescent tubes during two growing seasons.
   3. In S. fuscum, shoot density, mass relations and length increment over time were measured and productivity was estimated, Pigment concentration, rates of dark respiration and maximum net photosynthesis were recorded.
   4. Sphagnum fuscum productivity was not changed by enhanced UV-B radiation while properties determining production were highly influenced although in opposite directions.
   5. Height increment was decreased by 20% in the first growing season and by 31% in the second growing season under enhanced UV-B radiation. After two growing seasons spatial shoot density was decreased by 8% by enhanced W-B radiation. The shoots became stunted as capitulum dry mass and stem dry mass per unit length were increased by 21 and 17%, respectively, under enhanced W-B radiation.
   6. Dark; respiration was significantly decreased by 31% after growth under enhanced W-B radiation.
   7. The UV-B induced change in shoot biometry together with the reduced spatial shoot density involve potential long-term effects on peat structure with possible feedback on productivity, decomposition and the strength of the system as a carbon sink.

AB In the present study we reviewed the genesis, development and classification of peatlands in the Iberian Peninsula by conducting chronostratigraphic analysis of 108 of these ecosystems. The findings are summarised as follows:
   1. The region has a wide variety of peatlands which are classified according to their biogeochemical, geomorphological and ecological characteristics into different types of bogs and fens.
   2. Most of the peatlands occur in the Atlantic region followed by the Mediterranean and Alpine regions. Fens are more widely distributed than bogs, and blanket and raised bogs are mainly found in the Eurosiberian biogeographical region.
   3. In many of the fens, the last active peat-forming cycle occurred during the Late Holocene (43 %). In most of the bogs, the peat-forming cycle occurred in the Middle Holocene (70 %), although in a substantial proportion of blanket bogs these processes occurred in the Early Holocene (30 %).
   4. The peat formed in the last active cycle is, on average, thicker in raised bogs (322 cm) than in blanket bogs (257 cm) and fens (156 cm).
   5. Vertical peat accumulation rates varied between 16 and 30 yr cm(-1) in more than 40 % of the peatlands. The accumulation rates differed significantly between the different types of peatlands and were highest in the raised bogs. The accumulation rates were very variable in the fens.
   6. The genesis, evolution and types of Iberian peatlands are similar to those observed in peatlands in northern latitudes in Europe and North America.

AB Estimating carbon sequestration and nutrient accumulation rates in Northeast China are important to assess wetlands function as carbon sink buffering greenhouse gas increasing in North Asia. The objectives of this study were to estimate accreting rates of carbon and nutrients in typical temperate wetlands. Results indicated that average soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) contents were 37.81%, 1.59% and 0.08% in peatlands, 5.33%, 0.25% and 0.05% in marshes, 2.92%, 0.27% and 0.10% in marshy meadows, respectively. Chronologies reconstructed by Pb-210 in the present work were acceptable and reliable, and the average time to yield 0-40 cm depth sediment cores was 150 years. Average carbon sequestration rate (Carbon(sq)), nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation rates were 219.4 g C/(m(2).yr), 9.16 g N/(m(2).yr) and 0.46 g P/(m(2).yr) for peatland; 57.13 g C/(m(2).yr), 5.42 g N/(m(2).yr) and 2.16 g P/(m(2).yr) for marshy meadow; 78.35 g C/(m(2).yr), 8.70 g N/(m(2).yr) and 0.71 g P/(m(2).yr) for marshy; respectively. Positive relations existed between Carbon(sq) with nitrogen and precipitations, indicating that Carbon(sq) might be strengthened in future climate scenarios.

AB The rhizospheres of five different potato cultivars (including a genetically modified cultivar) obtained from a loamy sand soil and two from a sandy peat soil, next to corresponding bulk soils, were studied with respect to their community structures and potential function. For the former analyses, we performed bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) on the basis of soil DNA; for the latter, we extracted microbial communities and subjected these to analyses in phenotype arrays (PM1, PM2, and PM4, Biolog), with a focus on the use of different carbon, sulfur and phosphorus sources. In addition, we performed bacterial PCR-DGGE on selected wells to assess the structures of these substrate-responsive communities. Effects of soil type, the rhizosphere, and cultivar on the microbial community structures were clearly observed. Soil type was the most determinative parameter shaping the functional communities, whereas the rhizosphere and cultivar type also exerted an influence. However, no genetically modified plant effect was observed. The effects were imminent based on general community analysis and also single-compound analysis. Utilization of some of the carbon and sulfur sources was specific per cultivar, and different microbial communities were found as defined by cultivar. Thus, both soil and cultivar type shaped the potato root-associated bacterial communities that were responsive to some of the substrates in phenotype arrays.

AB The objective of this review paper is to present the current state of knowledge about poly-3-hydroxybutyrate produced by methanotrophic bacteria. Methanotrophs are a large group of microorganisms, which live in different kinds of environment, but they preferably occupy places with high methane production, such as swamps, peat bogs, rice fields, or widely understood geological deposits. Methanotrophic bacteria are an important object of research for specialists of environmental biotechnology, are increasingly identified in environmental samples. Methanotrophs are Gram-negative microorganisms, they belonging to the group of Proteobacteria and classified as methylotrophs. In their metabolic cycle, they use methane as the main source of coal and energy. PHB is a linear polyester of 3-hydroxybutyric acid, PHB is accumulated in microorganisms during physiological stress, triggered by the deficit of biogenic elements, such as nitrogen or phosphorus and when the concentration of carbon source is high. Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate belongs to a large group of biodegradable polymers known as polyhydroxyallcanoates. PHB has a similar physico-chemical properties as conventional polymers. PHB is environmentally friendly due to the fast biodegradation and production non-toxic waste during degradation. For this reason poli-3-hydroxybutyrate is an interesting alternative to petrochemical polymers. PHB found a lot of applications in industry, medicine and pharmacy.

AB Northern peatlands are an important source for greenhouse gases, but their capacity to produce methane remains uncertain under changing climatic conditions. We therefore analyzed a 43year time series of the pore-water chemistry to determine if long-term shifts in precipitation altered the vertical transport of solutes within a large peat basin in northern Minnesota. These data suggest that rates of methane production can be finely tuned to multidecadal shifts in precipitation that drive the vertical penetration of labile carbon substrates within the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands. Tritium and cation profiles demonstrate that only the upper meter of these peat deposits was flushed by downwardly moving recharge from 1965 to 1983 during a Transitional Dry-to-Moist Period. However, a shift to a moister climate after 1984 drove surface waters much deeper, largely flushing the pore waters of all bogs and fens to depths of 2m. Labile carbon compounds were transported downward from the rhizosphere to the basal peat at this time producing a substantial enrichment of methane in C-14 with respect to the solid-phase peat from 1991 to 2008. These data indicate that labile carbon substrates can fuel deep production zones of methanogenesis that more than doubled in thickness across this large peat basin after 1984. Moreover, the entire peat profile apparently has the capacity to produce methane from labile carbon substrates depending on climate-driven modes of solute transport. Future changes in precipitation may therefore play a central role in determining the source strength of peatlands in the global methane cycle.

AB At the Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada, DOC export measured at the basin outflow was -8.3 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1), and DOC loading via precipitation was estimated to be 1.5 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Discharge and DOC export calculated using a Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation compared weil (within 1 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) to outflow estimates of DOC export. and confirmed that outflow measurements were a suitable proxy for DOC seepage at the peatland margins. DOC export was 12% of the magnitude of the residual carbon sink measured at the peatland. The [DOC] across groundwater transects decreased with depth, and [DOC] sampled below 0.75 m depths remained fairly constant over the study period. However, [DOC] exported through the acrotelm (0 to 0.45 m peat depth) was variable, ranging from 40 mg l(-1) after snowmelt to 70 mg l(-1) during the growing season. Fluorescence analysis revealed that exported DOC was 'allochthonous-like', whereas DOC in the catotelm (deeper layers of peat) became more 'autochthonous-like' with depth. A conceptual model is developed to summarize the hydrological processes and controls which affect DOC biogeochemistry at the Mer Bleue. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Recently, magnesia has drawn much attention for enhancing phosphorus (P) removal of constructed wetlands. However, the poor nitrogen (N) removal efficiency of magnesia-containing constructed wetlands (Mg-CWs) inherently caused by magnesia impedes its application. In this study, peat and intermittent aeration were applied to enhance N removal in a Mg-CW, identified as P-CW and A-CW, respectively. A high TP removal rate (around 90%) was achieved in all CW, and the TN removal rate in the P-CW was 91.05% higher than that in the Mg-CW, which was mainly because the carbon source provided by the peat directly promoted the growth and metabolism of microorganisms and plants. Higher fresh weight of plants was obtained in P-CW (64.94 +/- 5.78 g), compared with A-CW (35.88 +/- 15.25 g) and Mg-CW (46.25 +/- 18.88 g), accomplished by stronger tolerance to high pH (>10). The microbial abundance (16S rRNA) in the P-CW was 15.6 and 8.12 times higher than that of Mg-CW and A-CW, respectively, resulting in lower global warming potential. Tanking all factors into consideration, addition of peat could be an effective method to optimize the nutrient removal performance of Mg-CW.

AB Natural peatlands are an important component of the global carbon cycle, representing a net long-term sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The natural carbon storage function of these ecosystems can be severely impacted due to Peatland drainage and peat extraction, leading to large and persistent sources of atmospheric CO2 following peat extraction abandonment. Standard restoration techniques aim to restore the peatland to a carbon-accumulating system through various water management techniques to improve hydrological conditions and through reintroducing Sphagnum at the surface. However, restoring the hydrology of peatlands can be expensive due to the cost of implementing the various restoration techniques. This study examines the net ecosystem CO2 exchange of a new extraction-restoration technique where the acrotelm is preserved and replaced directly on the cutover surface. Peat respiration at the experimental restored acrotelm (110.5 g C.m(-2) over the study period: May 20 - August 18) was significantly lower than at the natural peatland (144.8 and 203.7 g C.m(-2), wet and dry plots respectively). However, gross ecosystem production (GEP) at the experimental site was significantly reduced (-54.0 and -34.4 g C.m(-2)) compared to the natural site (-179.2 and -162.0 g C.m(-2)). Consequently, this was a growing season net emitter of CO2 to the atmosphere over the season at the experimental site (78.5 and 56.5 g C.m(-2)) and a growing season sink of CO2 at the natural site (-17.6 and -22.8 g C.m(-2)). Light response curves indicated that maximum GEP was significantly lower at the experimental site; however, it is likely that the percentage of living and dead vegetation at the plots post restoration had a large control on this lower productivity as plots with more living vegetation had higher overall productivity (GEP). Nevertheless, the experimental site did maintain limited productivity post-extraction, indicating that the carbon dynamics of the system was maintained due to this acrotelm restoration process, thereby likely returning the ecosystem toward a natural sink of atmospheric CO2 faster than natural rehabilitation and current restoration techniques. As such, this approach to peat extraction may be an environmentally preferred approach to use.

Nusantara Bioscience 8: 201-206. Peatland forest is one of ecosystems that are susceptible to the alterations of water regimes. Our previous study demonstrated that hydrologic conditions are predominant variables in determining carbon respiration rates from peat soils. However, we have limited empirical measures of how hydrologic conditions (i. e., soil water table) affect the carbon respirations. A study had been conducted to ascertain the effects of water table levels on soil CO2 respirations of West Kalimantan coastal forested and bare peatland. We simulated natural intact peat core condition by designing 25 of "a double bucket" water level experiment using 5 levels of water tables (0-40cm) and measure soil CO2 respiration at soil surfaces. Results showed that water table levels significantly affected soil CO2 respiration, as well as peat microclimate conditions. Results also demonstrated that forest canopy had significant effects on reducing peat CO2 respiration through its function in maintaining site-environment conditions compared to bare peatland site. This study reveals that it is important to maintain peatland water level close to peat surface and to maintain forest/vegetation covered on peatlands to reduce soil CO2 emissions.

AB Boreal peatlands are major catchment sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrients and thus strongly regulate the landscape carbon balance, aquatic food webs, and downstream water quality. Climate change is likely to influence catchment solute yield directly through climatic controls on run-off generation, but also indirectly through altered disturbance regimes. In this study we monitored water chemistry from early spring until fall at the outlets of a 321 km(2) catchment that burned 3 years prior to the study and a 134 km(2) undisturbed catchment. Both catchments were located in the discontinuous permafrost zone of boreal western Canada and had similar to 60% peatland cover. The two catchments had strong similarities in the timing of DOC and nutrient yields, but a few differences were consistent with anticipated effects of wildfire based on peatland porewater analysis. The 4-week spring period, particularly the rising limb of the spring freshet, was crucial for accurate characterization of the seasonal solute yield from both catchments. The spring period was responsible for similar to 65% of the seasonal DOC and nitrogen and for similar to 85% of the phosphorous yield. The rising limb of the spring freshet was associated with high phosphorous concentrations and DOC of distinctly high aromaticity and molecular weight. Shifts in stream DOC concentrations and aromaticity outside the early spring period were consistent with shifts in relative streamflow con-tribution from precipitation-like water in the spring to mineral soil groundwater in the summer, with consistent relative contributions from organic soil porewater. Radiocarbon content (C-14) of DOC at the outlets was modern throughout May to September (fraction modern carbon, fM: 0.99-1.05) but likely reflected a mix of aged DOC, e.g. porewater DOC from permafrost (fM: 0.65-0.85) and non-permafrost peatlands (fM: 0.95-1.00), with modern bomb-influenced DOC, e.g. DOC leached from forest litter (fM: 1.05-1.10). The burned catchment had significantly increased total phosphorous (TP) yield and also had greater DOC yield during summer which was characterized by a greater contribution from aged DOC. Overall, however, our results suggest that DOC composition and yield from peatland-rich catchments in the discontinuous permafrost region likely is more sensitive to climate change through impacts on run-off generation rather than through altered fire regimes.

AB Variation of plant species cover on a Sphagnum-dominated mire in the south-eastern Alps of Italy was assessed over a 10-year period in relation to depth to the water table, peat accumulation rate, and climate. Population dynamics of vascular species appeared to be primarily affected by the autogenic process of peat accumulation, which determined the lowering of water-table position at microhabitat scale. Increase of depth to the water table through peat accumulation resulted in increased cover of ericaceous shrubs at previously moister microhabitats. Conversely, graminoid species such as Eriophorum vaginatum, Trichophorum caespitosum, and Scheuchzeria palustris, being negatively affected by autogenic peat growth, were forced to shift their niche towards the wetter end of the water-table gradient. Carex limosa and Carex rostrata decreased their cover along the whole gradient in depth to the water table, likely due to multiple processes related to peat accumulation, competition with bryophytes, and a negative feedback due to increased litter deposition. Bryophytes, in particular Sphagnum mosses, appeared more sensitive to climatic conditions, with higher precipitation favouring faster-growing species. Accordingly, Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum magellanicum increased their cover much more than Sphagnum capillifolium, whereas Polytrichum strictum showed the strongest decrease at sites where S. magellanicum cover increased most.

AB Peatlands comprise a globally important carbon pool whose input-output budgets may be significantly altered by climate change. To experimentally determine the sensitivity of the carbon stored in peatlands to climate change, we constructed a mesocosm facility with 54 peat monoliths from a bog and fen in northern Minnesota, USA. These mesocosms were subjected to nine combinations of heat and water-table levels over eight years. Bog mesocosms initially accumulated soil carbon, with greater gains in wetter mesocosms, but after three years no further water-table effects occurred. In contrast, fen mesocosms lost or had no change in soil carbon, with the greatest losses in drier and warmer mesocosms. Changes in soil-carbon storage resulted in concomitant changes in water-table depth, so that water-table depths were similar to those in the natural source sites by the end of the experiment regardless of the initial treatment. These results were primarily due to water-table effects on Sphagnum moss production in the bog mesocosms and to a more complicated suite of warming and water-table effects on production and decomposition in the fen mesocosms. We show that different kinds of peatlands will rapidly gain or lose carbon following hydrological disturbance until they return to their characteristic ("equilibrium'') water-table levels. Our results illustrate the potential for a rapid homeostatic response of these ecosystems to future climate change at small spatial scales. Climate change will likely also interact with other carbon cycle-hydrological feedbacks at the scale of the entire peatland over longer time frames and larger spatial scales.

AB We present a decadal (1994-2004) record of carbon dioxide flux in a 160-year-old black spruce forest/veneer bog complex in central Manitoba, Canada. The ecosystem shifted from a source (+41 g C m(-2), 1995) to a sink (-21 g C m(-2), 2004) of CO2 over the decade, with an average net carbon balance near zero. Annual mean temperatures increased 1-2 degrees during the period, consistent with the decadal trend across the North American boreal biome. We found that ecosystem carbon exchange responded strongly to air temperature, moisture status, potential evapotranspiration, and summertime solar radiation. The seasonal cycle of ecosystem respiration significantly lagged that of photosynthesis, limited by the rate of soil thaw and the slow drainage of the soil column. Factors acting over long time scales, especially water table depth, strongly influenced the carbon budget on annual time scales. Net uptake was enhanced and respiration inhibited by multiple years of rainfall in excess of evaporative demand. Contrary to expectations, we observed no correlation between longer growing seasons and net uptake, possibly because of offsetting increases in ecosystem respiration. The results indicate that the interactions between soil thaw and water table depth provide critical controls on carbon exchange in boreal forests underlain by peat, on seasonal to decadal time scales, and these factors must be simulated in terrestrial biosphere models to predict response of these regions to future climate.

AB Raised bogs have accumulated more atmospheric carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Climate-induced expansion of trees and shrubs may turn these ecosystems from net carbon sinks into sources when associated with reduced water tables. Increasing water loss through tree evapotranspiration could potentially deepen water tables, thus stimulating peat decomposition and carbon release. Bridging the gap between modelling and field studies, we conducted a three-year mesocosm experiment subjecting natural bog vegetation to three birch tree densities, and studied the changes in subsurface temperature, water balance components, leaf area index and vegetation composition. We found the deepest water table in mesocosms with low tree density. Mesocosms with high tree density remained wettest (i.e. highest water tables) whereas the control treatment without trees had intermediate water tables. These differences are attributed mostly to differences in evapotranspiration. Although our mesocosm results cannot be directly scaled up to ecosystem level, the systematic effect of tree density suggests that as bogs become colonized by trees, the effect of trees on ecosystem water loss changes with time, with tree transpiration effects of drying becoming increasingly offset by shading effects during the later phases of tree encroachment. These density-dependent effects of trees on water loss have important implications for the structure and functioning of peatbogs.

AB Catchment export of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its downstream degradation in aquatic ecosystems are important components of landscape scale carbon balances. In order to assess the influence of peatland permafrost on river DOM characteristics, we sampled 65 rivers along a 900 km transect crossing into the southern discontinuous permafrost zone on the Boreal and Tundra Plains of western Canada. Catchment peatland cover and catchment location north or south of the permafrost boundary were found together to have strong influences on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM chemical composition. River DOC concentrations increased with catchment peatland cover, but were consistently lower for catchments north of the permafrost boundary. In contrast, protein fluorescence (PARAFAC analysis), was unrelated to catchment peatland cover but increased significantly in rivers north of the permafrost boundary. Humic and fulvic acid contribution to DOM fluorescence was lower in rivers draining catchments with large lakes than in other rivers, consistent with extensive photodegradation, but humic and fulvic acid fluorescence were also lower in rivers north of the permafrost boundary than in rivers to the south. We hypothesize that shifts in river DOM characteristics when crossing the permafrost boundary are related to the influence of permafrost on peatland hydrological connectivity to stream networks, peatland DOM characteristics and differences in DOM degradation within aquatic ecosystems.

AB Climate projections forecast a redistribution of seasonal precipitation for much of the globe into fewer, larger events spaced between longer dry periods, with negligible changes in seasonal rainfall totals. This intensification of the rainfall regime is expected to alter near-surface water availability, which will affect plant performance and carbon uptake. This could be especially important in peatland systems, where large stores of carbon are tightly coupled to water surpluses limiting decomposition. Here, we examined the role of precipitation frequency on vegetation growth and carbon dioxide (CO2) balances for communities dominated by a Sphagnum moss, a sedge, and an ericaceous shrub in a cool temperate poor fen. Field plots and laboratory monoliths received one of three rainfall frequency treatments, ranging from one event every three days to one event every 14 days, while total rain delivered in a two-week cycle and the entire season to each treatment remained the same. Separating incident rain into fewer but larger events increased vascular cover in all peatland communities: vascular plant cover increased 6x in the moss-dominated plots, nearly doubled in the sedge plots, and tripled in the shrub plots in Low-Frequency relative to High-Frequency treatments. Gross ecosystem productivity was lowest in moss communities receiving low-frequency rain, but higher in sedge and shrub communities under the same conditions. Net ecosystem exchange followed this pattern: fewer events with longer dry periods increased CO2 flux to the atmosphere from the moss while vascular plant-dominated communities became more of a sink for CO2. Results of this study suggest that changes to rainfall frequency already occurring and predicted to continue will lead to increased vascular plant cover in peatlands and will impact their carbon-sink function.

AB Changes in climate and land use pressures in the boreal region may influence peatland stream sediment organic carbon (C) dynamics. Fifteen to 50% of stream sediment organic C resides in recalcitrant pools, with the lipids accounting for up to 25% of the peatland C pool. Nevertheless, lipid mineralization within peatlands and their draining stream sediments is poorly understood. Potential esterase activity, which is known to be an important enzyme group in recalcitrant C decomposition, is presented as an indicator of lipid hydrolysis in three streams surrounding an intermediate fen peatland. Organic C concentration ranged from 5 to 250 g C kg(-1) sediment during the sampling period, with the recalcitrant C pool accounting for 15 to 20%. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were typical of humic-like substances, such as aliphatic compounds (including lipids), phenolic and other aromatic structures, carboxyl groups, and polysaccharide structures. Esterase activity was positively correlated with organic C and total nitrogen (N) concentrations, and sediment pH. Esterase was most active in the presence of high organic C fractions and recalcitrant C, supporting the hypothesis that lipid hydrolysis in the peatland stream sediments may be an important and underestimated component of peatland C sequestration dynamics.

AB Climate change is altering the water-table (WT) height and near-surface moisture conditions in northern peatlands, which in turn both increases the susceptibility to fire and reduces the carbon sink capacity of these ecosystems. To further develop remote sensing-based measurements of peatland moisture characteristics, we employed coincident surface reflectance and moisture measurements in two Sphagnum moss-dominated peatland sites. We applied the Mexican hat continuous wavelet transform to the measured spectra to generate wavelet features and coefficients across a range of scales. Overall, wavelet analysis was an improvement over the previously tested spectral indices at both the study sites. Linear mixed effect models for WT height using wavelet features accounted for more of the variance with both an improved marginal R-2 (29% greater) and a larger conditional R-2 (21% greater) compared to the best performing spectral index. While spectral indices performed similarly with wavelet coefficients for moisture content measured at 3 cm depth, they performed poorly for volumetric moisture content measured at 7 cm depth. The current study also revealed the advantage of selecting the best subsets of wavelet features based upon genetic algorithm over a more widely used technique that selects features based on correlation scalograms. It also provided new insights into the significance of various spectral regions to detect WT alteration-induced vegetation change.

AB Peatland open-water pools, a common feature on temperate to subarctic peatlands, are sources of carbon (C) to the atmosphere but their contribution to the net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE-CO2) is poorly known; there is a question as to whether peatlands with pools are smaller sinks of atmospheric C, or even C-neutral, compared to other peatlands. We present growing season NEE-CO2 measurements using the eddy covariance technique in a peatland with pools. We found the maximum photosynthetic uptake and ecosystem respiration rates at 10 degrees C to be in the lower range of the published data. The lower total vegetation biomass, due to the presence of pools, reduced CO2 uptake during day and the autotrophic component of ecosystem respiration. The low CO2 uptake combined with reduced CO2 loss resulted in the site being a net sink for CO2 of a similar magnitude as other northern peatlands despite the inclusion of pools.

AB Peatlands represent an important component of the global carbon cycle, storing 180-621 Gt of carbon (C). Small-scale spatial variations in elevation, frequently referred to as microtopography, influence ecological processes associated with the peatland C cycle, including Sphagnum photosynthesis and methane flux. Microtopography can be characterized with measures of topographic variability and by using conceptual classes (microforms) linked to function: most commonly hummocks and hollows. However, the criteria used to define these conceptual classes are often poorly described, if at all, and vary between studies. Such inconsistencies compel development of explicit quantitative methods to classify microforms. Furthermore, gradient-based characterizations that describe spatial variability without the use of microforms are lacking in the literature. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (1) calculate peatland microtopographical elevation gradients and measures of spatial variability, (2) develop three microform classification methods intended for specific purposes, and (3) evaluate and contrast classification methods. Our results suggest that at spatial scales much larger than microforms, elevation distributions are unimodal and are well approximated with parametric probability density functions. Results from classifications were variable between methods and years and exhibited significant differences in mean hollow areal coverages of a raised ombrotrophic bog. Our results suggest that the conceptualization and classification of microforms can significantly influence microtopographic structural metrics. The three explicit methods for microform classification described here may be used and built upon for future applications.

AB Wetlands, including peatlands, supply crucial ecosystem services such as water purification, carbon sequestration and regulation of hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. Peatlands are especially important as carbon sinks and stores because of the incomplete decomposition of vegetation within the peat. Good knowledge of individual wetlands exists locally, but information on how different wetland systems interact with their surroundings is lacking. In this study, the ability to use a depression-based digital elevation model (DEM) method to inventory wetlands in northern landscapes and assess their hydrological connectivity was investigated. The method consisted of three steps: (1) identification and mapping of wetlands, (2) identification of threshold values of minimum wetland size and depth, and (3) delineation of a defined coherent area of multiple wetlands with hydrological connectivity, called wetlandscape. The results showed that 64% of identified wetlands corresponded with an existing wetland map in the study area, but only 10% of the wetlands in the existing map were identified, with the F1 score being 17%. Therefore, the methodology cannot independently map wetlands and future research should be conducted in which additional data sources and mapping techniques are integrated. However, wetland connectivity could be mapped with the depression-based DEM methodology by utilising information on upstream and downstream wetland depressions, catchment boundaries and drainage flow paths. Knowledge about wetland connectivity is crucial for understanding how physical, biological and chemical materials are transported and distributed in the landscape, and thus also for resilience, management and protection of wetlandscapes.

AB The terrestrial-aquatic interface is a crucial environment in which to consider the fate of exported terrestrial carbon in the aquatic system. Here the fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may be controlled by nutrient availability. However, peat-dominated headwater catchments are normally of low nutrient status and thus there is little data on how DOC and nutrient export co-varies. We present nutrient and DOC data for two UK catchments dominated by peat headwaters. One, Whitelee, is undergoing development for Europe's largest windfarm. Glen Dye by comparison is relatively undisturbed. At both sites there are significant linear relationships between DOC and soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate concentrations in the drainage waters. However, inter-catchment differences exist. Changes in the pattern of nutrient and carbon export at Whitelee reveal that landscape disturbance associated with windfarm development impacts the receiving waters, and that nutrient export does not increase in a stoichiometric manner that will promote increase in microbial biomass but rather supports aquatic respiration. In turn greater CO2 efflux may prevail. Hence disturbance of terrestrial carbon stores may impact the both the aquatic and gaseous carbon cycle. We suggest estimates of aquatic carbon export should inform the decision-making process prior to development in ecosystems and catchments with high terrestrial carbon storage.

AB Soil microbes and enzymes in permafrost peatland are sensitive to temperature changes, which might result in more potential loss of carbon and increase in available nitrogen from permafrost peatlands in a warming world. We previously demonstrated that 3-year warming could affect soil microbial abundance and enzymatic activity. However, soil microbial abundance and enzymatic activity in permafrost peatlands under long-term climate warming is not well understood. Therefore, a 6-year field manipulation experiment was used to assess the impact of long-term warming on soil microbial abundance and enzymatic activity in a permafrost peatland in northeastern China. Results showed that 6-year warming increased the abundance of bacteria in 0 to 15 cm soil under tussock and from shrub rhizosphere, fungi from shrub non-rhizosphere, and archaea under tussock and from the rhizosphere of shrub. These increased microbial abundances could stimulate soil carbon cycling and accelerate soil carbon loss in permafrost peatland under warming. Six-year warming increased methanogen abundance in 0 to 15 cm soil and methanotroph abundance in 15 to 30 cm soil under tussock, indicating that warming could enhance CH4 cycling. Soil nirS-denitrifier abundance from the 0 to 15 cm shrub rhizosphere increased under warming, thereby suggesting that warming stimulated denitrification and N2O emission. ?-Glucosidase activity in 0 to 15 cm soil under tussock and from shrub rhizosphere increased, but invertase activity in 15 to 30 cm soil under tussock and from shrub rhizosphere showed opposite tendency under warming. DOC content tended to increase in the 0 to 15 cm rhizosphere soil, but decreased in shrub non-rhizosphere soil. Warming increased NH4+?N content in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil. Positive correlations between abundances of bacteria, archaea, contents of DOC, and NH4+?N in 0 to 15 cm soil suggest that increases in bacterial and archaeal abundance could indicate higher carbon and nitrogen availability in topsoil of permafrost peatlands under warming. The results offer new insights into the response of plant?soil-microbe interactions in permafrost peatlands to climate change.

AB The floodplain of the middle part of the Treene River in Northern Germany (Schleswig area) was investigated at 5 different sites. A notable presence of two glacial lakes appearing as sediment sinks is found upstream. The local catchment, therefore, has a limited size. During investigation of the ever-present valley-fens, a remarkably strong content of clastic sediments in the upper parts of the profiles were found. The content of organic carbon otherwise is clearly smaller. This phenomenon should be analyzed in detail. By way of common analyses, radiocarbon dating, and a first overview of the pollen content, it was possible to prove that the beginning of the strengthened sedimentation of the Treene River occurred during the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Period (15th century) due to strong expansion of agriculture in the Schleswig duchy caused by agricultural reforms. Furthermore, it could be calculated that an amount of nearly 20,000 t per km of organic carbon became accumulated in the peaty valley sediments. The capacity of this carbon sink was highly reduced, however, due to the strengthened sediment freight. Transferred to a part of the river catchment, this amount of clastic sediment corresponds to 0.85 kg eroded soil material per m(2).

AB Net primary production (NPP) and decomposition were measured in a suite of representative microsite types, and Ph-210 age was determined on near-surface peat in a hypermaritime sloping peatland in British Columbia, Canada. Hummock and depression communities had significantly higher aboveground NPP, and were characterized by higher moss NPP than other communities. Mass loss of a standard litter material was significantly different among the microcommunities, possibly because of the differences in microsite oxic conditions and water movement. Incubated litter material lost C and gained N during the 2-yr trial in all microcommunities, except for the Sphagnum austinii hummock, where N was lost at shallow depth. Low N content in the living Sphagnum and further N depletion in hummocks suggest that the hummock Sphagnum peat is recalcitrant to decomposition. Peat accumulation was found to be faster in hummock than in lawn communities. The hummock Sphagnum NPP and mass loss values were higher than published values for continental peatlands, possibly due to the wet and mild hypermaritime climate in this region. The recalcitrant nature of the litter and high NPP in hummocks likely account for rapid peat accumulation at the surface, whereas peat decomposition is most pronounced with depth, resulting in similar C sink strength as in hummocks in continental peatlands. Given that lawn community predominates, overall C sequestration capacity at the study site was estimated to be smaller than in continental peatlands. Possible range of C sink strength in sloping open peatlands in the hypermaritime region, therefore, is lower than or close to that in continental peatlands.

AB In this paper, we assess the extent to which the export of terrestrially fixed carbon to aquatic systems and the aquatic metabolism of this carbon affect the overall accumulation of organic carbon in a boreal catchment. We estimated the contribution of stocks and processes in aquatic environments to the carbon balance of a boreal catchment in northern Sweden. We used published data concerning the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in terrestrial environments, and calculations of loss of terrestrial carbon to surface water and the turnover of terrestrial carbon in aquatic systems. The NEE of terrestrial environments was estimated to be 139 gC/m(2) of catchment area per year. The export of terrestrially fixed carbon to aquatic systems was 8.6 g C/m(2)/yr, resulting in a net accumutation of organic carbon in terrestrial systems of 131 g C/m(2) /yr. Almost 45% of the terrestrial export was mineralized in streams and takes and evaded as CO2, while most of the remaining (approximately 55%) terrestrial export was transported to the sea as organic carbon or as dissolved inorganic carbon emanating from soil respiration. The sedimentation of organic carbon and input of organic carbon via aquatic primary production were insignificant when compared to the mineralization and river transport of terrestrial organic carbon. Aquatic fluxes were small compared to the terrestrial NEE, which we consider to be largely a consequence of the studied catchment being subject to intensive forestry resulting in a large annual accumulation of carbon in growing tree biomass.

AB Mountain fens are vital ecosystems for habitat, biodiversity, water and carbon cycling, but there is little comprehensive information on their distribution, abundance or condition in any region of the western U.S. Our study objectives were to: 1) evaluate fen distribution, abundance and characteristics in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, 2) quantify disturbances, and 3) prioritize restoration needs of fens. We mapped 624 fens in 37 watersheds and collected field data on 182 of these fens. We estimated that approximately 2,000 fens occur in the San Juan Mountains, primarily in the subalpine zone at an average elevation of 3,288 m. Fens ranged from 0.2 to 20.5 ha in size, peat thickness ranged between 0.40 to > 4.00 m, and surface slope ranged from 0-21%. Groundwater pH ranged from 3.1-7.6 and Ca+2 from 1-341 mg/L, reflecting the diverse geochemistry of watershed parent materials. We identified 188 vascular and 63 bryophyte taxa, and classified the 309 sampled stands into 20 plant communities that formed along complex hydrogeomorphic and geochemical gradients. The majority of fens were in excellent condition; however 10% of our sampled fens had high to very high restoration potential due to impacts from roads, mining, and ditching.

AB Because peat is elastic, the daily to seasonal swelling and shrinking of the peat surface not only affects water storage but also alters peatland hydraulics and the biogeochemical and thermal properties of peat. Due to different botanical origins and degrees of decomposition, we hypothesized that different peatland microforms (ridges and lawns) display a large variation in peat deformation and compressibility. Here we examined the spatial variation of peat surface movement, peat strength, and volumetric water content at a low lawn (LL), upper lawn (UL), and ridge (R) along a 5 m transect in a peatland in Quebec, Canada. The average seasonal amplitude in peat surface level was 9, 6, and 2 cm at the LL, UL, and R sites, respectively. The surface layers in each of these sites were fairly rigid with the largest changes in peat thickness occurring between 20 and 60 cm depth in the peat profile. Compressibility varied among microforms but was not correlated to other properties within the layer in individual soil layers. However, when average profile compressibility was considered, it was significantly correlated to peat depth, von Post humification, distance to hollow, and peat strength. The total water storage by dilation below the water table was about the same as the water deficit (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) for LL, while the storage deficit for UL and especially R was lower. Including changes in entrapped gas content over the season reduced estimates of changes in water storage at all sites. Because microform type and position were significant predictors of hydrophysical properties, we argue that this suggests that peatland microtopography is self-reinforcing through ecohydrological feedbacks. Including the variability in these properties in peatland ecohydrological models will be key for predicting the response of peatland ecosystems to disturbance.

AB Shallow water tables protect northern peatlands and their important carbon stocks from aerobic decomposition. Hydraulic conductivity, K, is a key control on water tables. The controls on K, particularly in degraded and restored peatlands, remain a subject of ongoing research. We took 29 shallow (50cm) peat cores from an estuarine raised bog in Wales, UK. Parts of the bog are in close-to-natural condition, while other areas have undergone shallow peat cutting for fuel and drainage, followed by restoration through ditch blocking. In the laboratory we measured horizontal (K-h) and vertical (K-v) hydraulic conductivity. We fitted linear multiple regression models to describe log(10)-transformed K-h and K-v on the basis of simple, easy-to-measure predictors. Dry bulk density and degree of decomposition were the strongest predictors of K-h and K-v. Perhaps surprisingly, the independent effect of hummocks was to produce higher-K-v peat than in lawns; while the independent effect of restored diggings was to produce higher-K peat than in uncut locations. Our models offer high explanatory power for K-h (adjusted r(2)=0.740) and K-v (adjusted r(2)=0.787). Our findings indicate that generalizable predictive models of peat K, similar to pedotransfer functions for mineral soils, may be attainable. K-h and K-v possess subtly different controls that are consistent with the contrasting roles of these two properties in peatland water budgets. Our near-surface samples show no evidence for the low-K marginal peat previously observed in deeper layers at the same site, indicating that such structures may be less important than previously believed.

AB The importance of bogs in the catchment hydrology of the Australian Alps has been long recognised but little studied. Damaged bogs are thought to be the source of dried peats now common throughout the Alps. We described the characteristics of a bog peat and a dried peat, to better understand the relationship between the two. Standard chemical properties of peat were measured: pH, loss on ignition, gravimetric contents of carbon and nitrogen, and electrical conductivity. We also measured the concentrations of total and plant-available elements, and the chemical composition of the organic carbon, leading to a measure of the extent of decomposition. The results suggest that this is a typical Sphagnum bog peat - low pH, high carbon content - and the distribution of carbon groups and other elements reflect the stable water source of this groundwater-fed Sphagnum bog. The properties of the dried peat were most similar to the catotelm (lower layer) of the bog peat. This resemblance, combined with decades of field observations, indicates that dried peat may form from the catotelm of bog peat, after the acrotelm (upper layer) dries and erodes. These results have implications for the management of Alps catchments, and further studies are needed to ascertain the hydrologic and carbon cycling roles of organic soils in the Australian Alps.

AB Peatlands are dominant sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to boreal inland waters and play important roles in the aquatic carbon cycle. Yet before peat-derived DOM enters aquatic networks, it needs to pass through peat-stream interfaces that are often characterized by transitions from anoxic or hypoxic to oxic conditions. Aeration at these interfaces may trigger processes that impact the DOM pool, and its fate downstream. Here we experimentally assessed how the aeration of iron- and organic-rich mire-waters influences biodegradation, particle-formation, and modification of DOM. In addition, we investigated how suspended peat-derived particles from mires may influence these processes. We found that within 5 days of aeration, 20% of the DOM transformed into particulate organic matter (POM). This removal was likely due to combination of mechanisms including coprecipitation with oxidized iron, aggregation, and DOM-adsorption onto peat-derived particles. Peat-derived particles promoted microbial activity, but biodegradation was a minor loss mechanism of DOM removal. Interestingly, microbial respiration accounted for only half of the oxygen loss, suggesting substantial nonrespiratory oxygen consumption. The differences observed in DOM characteristics between anoxic and aerated treatments suggest that hydrophilic, aromatic DOM coprecipitated with iron oxides in aerated samples, and the corresponding C:N analysis of generated POM revealed that these organic species were nitrogen-poor. Meanwhile, POM formed via adsorption onto peat-derived particles generated from nonaromatic DOM and more nitrogen-rich species. Hence, selective removal of DOM, dissolved iron, and thus oxygen may be important and overlooked processes in mire-dominated headwater systems.

AB Thermokarst lakes result from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost and are widespread across northern landscapes. These waters are strong emitters of methane, especially in permafrost peatland regions, where they are stained black by high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In the present study, we aimed to structurally characterize the DOM from a set of peatland thermokarst lakes that are known to be intense sites of microbial decomposition and methane emission. Samples were collected at different depths from three thermokarst lakes in the Sasapimakwananisikw (SAS) River valley near the eastern Hudson Bay community of Kuujjuarapik-Whapmagoostui (Nunavik, Canada). Samples were analyzed by spectrofluorometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and elemental analysis. Fluorescence analyses indicated considerable amounts of autochthonous DOM in the surface waters of one of SAS 1A, indicating a strong bioavailability of labile DOM, and consequently a greater methanogenic potential. The three lakes differed in their chemical composition and diversity, suggesting various DOM transformations phenomena. The usefulness of complementary analytical approaches to characterize the complex mixture of DOM in permafrost peatland waters cannot be overlooked, representing a first step towards greater comprehension of the organic geochemical properties of these permafrost-derived systems.

AB Unique peatland properties, such as their ability to preserve intact ancient human remains (bog bodies) and to store globally significant quantities of atmospheric CO2, can be attributed to their low rates of enzymic decomposition. Peatland soils are normally devoid of molecular oxygen in all, but the uppermost layer, and thus enzymes such as phenol oxidase, which require molecular oxygen for their activity, are rarely active. Interestingly, even the activities of enzymes such as hydrolases that have no oxygen requirement, are also extremely limited in peatlands. Here, we show that those low hydrolase activities can be indirectly attributed to oxygen constraints on phenol oxidase. On addition of oxygen, phenol oxidase activity increased 7-fold, P<0.05, a response that allowed phenolic depletion in the peatland soil. Phenolic materials are highly inhibitory to enzymes and their lower abundance allowed higher hydrolase activities (beta-glucosidase 26%, P<0.05, phosphatase 18%, P<0.05, sulphatase 47%, P<0.01, xylosidase 16%, P<0.05 and chitinase 22%, P<0.05). Thus, oxygen constraints upon phenol oxidase activity promote conditions that inhibit decomposition. This mechanism has important implications for preservation of archaeological organic materials, sequestration of atmospheric CO2 and potentially in the preservation of food and treatment of water pollution.

AB Northern peatlands are large repositories of carbon. Peatland vascular plant community composition has been functionally associated to a set of biogeochemical processes such as carbon cycling. Yet, we do not fully understand to what extent vascular plant functional types (PFTs) affect the quality of dissolved organic matter, and if there is any feedback on soil microbial activity.
   Using a longer-term plant removal experiment in a boreo-nemoral peatland in Southern Sweden, we relate the dominance of different vascular plant functional types (i.e. ericoids and graminoids) to the chemistry of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microbial enzymatic activities (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, FDA).
   Our results show that PFTs modifies the composition of DOM moieties, with a decrease of low molecular weight organic compounds after vascular plant removal. The decrease of enzymatic activity by up to 68 % in the plant removal plots suggests a reduction in DOM mineralization in the absence of vascular plants.
   Our results show that plant-derived low molecular organic compounds enhance peatland microbial activity, and suggest that an increase of vascular plant cover in response to climate change can potentially destabilize the OM in peatlands, leading to increased carbon losses.

AB This paper is the outcome of a group discussion held at the Savonlinna meeting 'Management of forest ecosystems and its impact on the GHG budget'. The aim of this break-out group discussion was to 'Characterize forest management impacts on the GHG budget of forest ecosystems in different European regions'. In this paper we briefly characterize different options that a forest owner has in order to maintain or maximize forest carbon pools and carbon sequestration. These hectare scale descriptions of measures are then regarded in connection to the current state of European forests and how they can be combined with ongoing management trends and local issues. We point out the various possibilities that exist in European forests, where they are located, and where they could possibly be combined with adaptation. We identify these hotspots for largest growing stocks, largest peat areas, and, e.g. largest risks for loss of carbon due to fire or urban sprawl. We conclude that one common strategy cannot be designed. Within each region, local solutions have to be found that optimize goals and aim at integrated and sustainable land use.

AB Environmental and biological variables fluctuate over different time scales. On the basis of power spectral analysis of 14 time series at four sites from northern peatlands (fens and raised bogs), the temporal variability of physical environment (temperatures, water tables) and biological variables (CO2 flux) shows power-law behaviour, with a scaling exponent ranging from about 0.5 to 1.5. The scaling exponents of air temperatures change from 1.5 at high frequency to 0.5 at low frequency, with a break point at diurnal period. Comparison with similar analysis of temperature data from climate stations suggests that the atmosphere above peatlands has more active heat exchange with waterlogged peatlands than with upland terrestrial ecosystems. Water tables from different peatlands show almost identical power spectra, with a scaling exponent of 1.0 over all time scales. CO2 exchange has more complex spectral structure, with two break points at daily and monthly periods. This spectral structure suggests scale-dependent influence of climatic and hydrological fluctuations on CO2 fluxes. CO2 flux responds to air temperature with a distinct diurnal spectral peak. These results indicate that time scales are important in discussing hydrology and carbon dynamics in peatlands, and that scaling up of short-term experimental results may be inadvisable. Further statistical analysis on drained and harvested peatlands would provide insights into understanding shift in peatland dynamics due to human disturbance. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Wetlands are important sources of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). We provide an in situ study of CH4 dynamics in the permanently submerged soil of a Swiss alpine fen. Physico-chemical pore water analyses were combined with structural and microbiological analyses of soil cores at high vertical resolution down to 50 cm depth. Methanotrophs and methanogens were active throughout the depth profile, and highest abundance of active methanotrophs and methanogens [6.1 x 10(5) and 1.1 x 10(7) pmoA and mcrA transcripts (g soil)(-1), respectively] was detected in the uppermost 2 cm of the soil. Active methanotrophic communities in the near-surface zone, dominated by viable mosses, varied from the communities in the deeper zones, but further changes with depth were not pronounced. Apart from a distinct active methanogenic community in the uppermost sample, a decrease of acetoclastic Methanosaetaceae with depth was observed in concomitance with decreasing root surface area. Overall, root surface area correlated with mcrA transcript abundance and CH4 pore water concentrations, which peaked (137.1 mu M) at 10 to 15 cm depth. Our results suggest that stimulation of methanogenesis by root exudates of vascular plants had a stronger influence on CH4 dynamics than stimulation of CH4 oxidation by O-2 input.

AB Aerobic symbiotic methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) in peat moss (Sphagnum spp) play a vital role in the carbon cycle in peat bogs They reduce methane emissions and provide CO2 to Sphagnum moss, resulting in effective in situ carbon recycling To establish biomarkers for these methanotrophs, sphagnum moss spp were incubated with (CH4)-C-13 and analysed for the degree of label incorporation in individual lipids We determined that mono-unsaturated fatty acids (FAs, C16 1 omega 7 and C18 1 omega 7), hopenes [hop-17(21)-ene and 2-methylhop-17(21)-ene] and tetrafunctionalized hopanoids (detected as 17 beta,21 beta-bishomohopanol after H5IO6 and NaBH4 treatment) are probably the prevailing methanotroph lipids in Sphagnum moss spp However, they are not unique for methanotrophs, as they have been detected in other ;bacteria. Natural delta C-13 values of these lipids in Sphagnum range from -31 parts per thousand to -38 parts per thousand Their limited isotopic depletion is probably the result of a mixed origin On the other hand, an origin from senile cycle methanotrophs (type II) that fix both CO2 and CH4 and are, therefore, isotopically less depleted, would also be consistent with the observed isotopic values We have not been able to identify an unambiguous biomarker for methanotrophs in peat moss. Nevertheless, our results show that a limited depletion in C-13 for hopanoids does not exclude the presence of an active methanotrophic community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB 1. Northern hemisphere peatlands are globally important stores of organic soil carbon. We examined effects of plant functional group identity on short-term carbon (C) flux in an ombrotrophic peatland in northern England, UK, by selectively removing one of each of the three dominant plant functional groups (ericoid dwarf-shrubs, graminoids and bryophytes). Carbon dynamics were quantified by a combination of CO2 flux measurements and (CO2)-C-13 stable isotope pulse labelling approaches.
   2. Significant effects of plant functional group removals on CO2 fluxes and tracer C-13 uptake and turnover were detected. Removal of ericoid dwarf- shrubs had the greatest influence on gross CO2 flux, increasing rates of respiration and photosynthesis by > 200% relative to the undisturbed control. After pulse labelling with (CO2)-C-13, we found that turnover of recent photosynthate, measured as respired (CO2)-C-13 was also greatest in the absence of dwarf- shrubs.
   3. Analysis of C-13 tracer enrichment in leaf tissues from all plant removal treatments showed that the rate of fixation of (CO2)-C-13 and turnover of C-13 labelled photosynthate in leaf tissue was greatest in graminoids and lowest in bryophytes. Furthermore, graminoid leaf C-13 enrichment was greatest when growing in the absence of dwarf-shrubs, suggesting that the presence of dwarf- shrubs reduced the photosynthetic activity of graminoids.
   4. We conclude that plant functional groups differentially influence the uptake and short-term flux of carbon in peatlands, suggesting that changes in the functional composition of vegetation resulting from global change have the potential to alter short-term patterns of carbon exchange in peatland.

AB In-stream processing of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in peat-sourced headwaters has been shown to be a significant part of the terrestrial carbon cycle, through photo- and bio-degradation, with both DOC and POC converted to carbon dioxide (CO2). This study reports a series of 70-h, in situ experiments investigating rates of degradation in unfiltered surface water from a headwater stream in the River Tees, North Pennines, UK. Half the samples were exposed to the normal day/night cycle (ambient); half were continuously dark. The study found that the DOC concentration of samples in the ambient treatment declined by 64 % over the 70 h, compared with 6 % decline for the samples kept in the dark. For POC, the loss in the ambient treatment was 13 %. The average initial rate of loss of DOC in the ambient treatment during the first day of the experiment was 3.36 mg C/l/h, and the average rate of photo-induced loss over the whole 70 h was 1.25 mg C/l/h. Scaling up these losses, the estimate of total organic carbon loss from UK rivers to the atmosphere is 9.4 Tg CO2/year which would be 0.94 % of the global estimate of CO2 emissions from streams and rivers from the 2013 IPCC report. Initial rate kinetics in the light were as high as 3rd order, but the study showed that no single rate law could describe the whole diurnal degradation cycle and that separate rate laws were required for night and day processes. The comparison of dark and ambient treatment processes showed no evidence of photo-stimulated bacterial degradation.

AB The assessment of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and respiration of ecosystem (Reco) of terrestrial ecosystems is necessary to improve our knowledge about the carbon cycle. The aims of this paper were to present reliable measurements of CO2 fluxes of a temperate bog ecosystem located in Poland using a closed dynamic chamber system and to obtain a daily dynamic course of CO2 fluxes over the 2007 vegetation season. Measurements of CO2 fluxes were carried out at Rzecin peatland ecosystem located in northwestern Poland using the set of two chambers (dark and transparent). Reco during the experiment period ranged from 2.65 to 14.76 mu molCO(2).m(-2).s(-1). The daily run of NEE was inversed to PPFD and the values of NEE varied from 0.06 to -11.82 mu molCO(2).m(-2).s(-1). We found differences between NEE and Reco in the wetland ecosystem with respect to term of measurements. The PPFD, air and soil temperatures explain most temporal variability of CO2 fluxes at Rzecin. But vegetation structure, its phenology and water-level depth seem also to play important roles. The chamber technique is a useful tool for determining carbon dioxide exchange between wetland surface and the atmosphere.

AB The natural resources conservation service (NRCS) curve number method is widely used to estimate runoff from rainfall events for four hydrological soil groups (A, B, C, and D). However, the NRCS soil groups do not yet include peat soils. Therefore, this study analyzed 59 rainfall-runoff events from two peat-dominated watersheds in Finland (Marjasuo, Royvansuo) and one in Norway (Grualia). The analysis used the United States Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) to calibrate curve numbers and initial abstraction ratios (I-a/S). This gave a mean I-a/S of 0.036, with a mean standard error of 0.003 and 95% confidence interval of 0.030-0.042, which is significantly lower than the value of 0.2 recommended in the NRCS curve number method. The mean curve number was 61, with a mean standard error of 0.9 and 95% confidence interval of 59-63 for the study watersheds. This study confirmed that application of the NRCS curve number method in HEC-HMS required separation of base flow from runoff. Calibration by HEC-HMS is an equivalent method to determine curve number from rainfall-runoff data. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Palsa peatlands are a significant carbon pool in the global carbon cycle and are projected to change by global warming due to accelerated permafrost thaw. Our aim was to use stable carbon isotopes as indicators of palsa degradation. Depth profiles of stable carbon isotopes generally reflect organic matter dynamics in soils with an increase of delta C-13 values during aerobic decomposition and stable or decreasing delta C-13 values with depth during anaerobic decomposition. Stable carbon isotope depth profiles of undisturbed and degraded sites of hummocks as well as hollows at three palsa peatlands in northern Sweden were used to investigate the degradation processes. The depth patterns of stable isotopes clearly differ between intact and degraded hummocks at all sites. Erosion and cryoturbation at the degraded sites significantly changes the stable carbon isotope depth profiles. At the intact hummocks the uplifting of peat material by permafrost is indicated by a turning in the delta C-13 depth trend, and this assessment is supported by a change in the C / N ratios. For hollows isotope patterns were less clear, but some hollows and degraded hollows in the palsa peatlands show differences in their stable carbon isotope depth profiles indicating enhanced degradation rates. We conclude that the degradation of palsa peatlands by accelerated permafrost thawing can be identified with stable carbon isotope depth profiles. At intact hummocks delta C-13 depth patterns display the uplifting of peat material by a change in peat decomposition processes.

AB Peatlands, which contain large carbon stocks that must be accounted for in the global carbon budget, are poorly represented in many earth system models. We integrated peatlands into the coupled Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) and the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM), which together simulate the fluxes of water, energy, and CO2 at the land surface-atmosphere boundary in the family of Canadian Earth system models (CanESMs). New components and algorithms were added to represent the unique features of peatlands, such as their characteristic ground floor vegetation (mosses), the slow decomposition of carbon in the water-logged soils and the interaction between the water, energy, and carbon cycles. This paper presents the modifications introduced into the CLASS-CTEM modelling framework together with site-level evaluations of the model performance for simulated water, energy and carbon fluxes at eight different peatland sites. The simulated daily gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration are well correlated with observations, with values of the Pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0.8 and 0.75 respectively. The simulated mean annual net ecosystem production at the eight test sites is 87 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which is 22 g C m(-2) yr(-1) higher than the observed annual mean. The general peatland model compares well with other site-level and regional-level models for peatlands, and is able to represent bogs and fens under a range of climatic and geographical conditions.

AB Relationships were determined between methane (CH4) production and in situ conditions within the permafrost active layer during a single melt season at Stordalen, Sweden, with a specific emphasis on temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis. In situ temperature, moisture, pH, dissolved organic carbon, and CH4 concentration data were measured at three contrasting active layer sites (sedge mire, Sphagnum mire, and ombrotrophic bog), and laboratory incubations of active layer material were subsequently employed to determine the sensitivity of CH4 production to temperature. Q(10) values, describing the CH4 production response of peat to a temperature change of 10 degrees C, ranged from 1.9 to 3.5 and 2.4 to 5.8 for the sedge and Sphagnum mire sites, respectively. A wider review of the literature on Q(10) responses of methanogenesis in northern peatlands shows similar features to the temperature response of CH4 production in the active layer at Stordalen. In general, Q(10) to values are not significantly different in Arctic permafrost wetlands than non-Arctic northern wetlands; however, Sphagnum sites display Q(10) responses (mean Q(10) = 8) that are notably greater than that of wetter minerotrophic-sedge environments (mean Q(10) = 4.3). This finding has implications for the parameterization of Q(10) factors in numerical carbon cycling models, and suggests that the use of spatially variable Q(10) values could be a useful approach for more accurate modeling of CH4 fluxes front northern wetlands under different climatic change scenarios.

AB Boreal and subarctic peatlands have been extensively studied for their major role in the global carbon balance. However, study efforts have so far neglected the contribution of these ecosystems to the non-methane biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, which are important in the atmospheric chemistry and feedbacks on climate change. We aimed at estimating the BVOC emissions from a subarctic peatland in northern Finland. Furthermore, our aim was to assess how these emissions are affected by enhanced UV-B radiation, the amount of which has increased especially at high latitudes as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion. The contribution of BVOC emissions to the total net carbon exchange and correlations between the emission of different BVOCs and net ecosystem CO(2) exchange, CH(4) emission, total green leaf area, and abiotic factors were also studied. The UV-B exposure, simulating a 20% depletion of stratospheric ozone, was started in 2003, and measurements were performed during the growing seasons of 2006 and 2008. The subarctic peatland proved to be a small source of BVOCs and the dominant moss, Warnstorfia exannulata, emitted a diverse compound spectrum. The water table level exerted a major influence on the BVOC emissions surpassing the effect of enhanced UV-B. In fact, no overall UV-B effect was established on the BVOC emissions, apart from toluene and 1-octene, emissions of which were doubled and tripled by enhanced UV-B in 2008, respectively. The contribution of BVOCs to the total net carbon exchange was below 1%.

AB Heterotrophic soil microorganisms rely on carbon (C) allocated belowground in plant production, but belowground C allocation (BCA) by plants is a poorly quantified part of ecosystem C cycling, especially, in peat soil. We applied a C balance approach to quantify BCA in a mixed conifer-red maple (Acer rubrum) forest on deep peat soil. Direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 fluxes across the soil surface (soil respiration), production of fine and small plant roots, and aboveground litterfall were used to estimate respiration by roots, by mycorrhizae and by free-living soil microorganisms. Measurements occurred in two consecutive years. Soil respiration rates averaged 1.2 bm mumol m(-2) s(-1) for CO2 and 0.58 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for CH4 (371 to 403 g C m(-2) year- 1). Carbon in aboveground litter (144 g C m(-2) year(-1)) was 84% greater than C in root production (78 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Complementary in vitro assays located high rates of anaerobic microbial activity, including methanogenesis, in a dense layer of roots overlying the peat soil and in large-sized fragments within the peat matrix. Large-sized fragments were decomposing roots and aboveground leaf and twig litter, indicating that relatively fresh plant production supported most of the anaerobic microbial activity. Respiration by free-living soil microorganisms in deep peat accounted for, at most, 29 to 38 g C m(-2) year(-1). These data emphasize the close coupling between plant production, ecosystem-level C cycling and soil microbial ecology, which BCA can help reveal.

AB Peatlands play an essential role in carbon cycling and global warming. However, the feedback of peatlands to global changes is still unclear. Here, we conducted a data synthesis of 236 observations from 52 field experiments to evaluate the effect of three important global changes (warming, nitrogen addition, and vegetation composition change) on three major greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes: CO2, CH4, and N2O. The results showed that (i) GHG responses to warming varied among warming methods, between air temperature increase rates, and between warming durations; (ii) GHG responses to N addition varied between peatland types, between N forms, between N concentrations, and between experimental durations; (iii) the response rates of GHGs were associated with local environmental parameters (mean annual precipitation, MAP; and water table level, WTL); (iv) the global warming potential (GWP) considerably increased under these global changes, which indicates that cooling function of peatlands will be weakened. Overall, given these global changes occur simultaneously, the interaction of them on GHG fluxes should not be ignored. Our results highlight that a large number of studies in different locations are needed to comprehensively understand and accurately predict GHG emissions from peatlands.

AB D The stream-riparian interface, characterized by a dynamic and complex hydrology, is an important control point for nutrient fluxes and processing between terrestrial and aquatic systems. Predicted alterations in the discharge regime in Mediterranean climate regions make it necessary to understand the effects of abrupt hydrological transition between dry and wet conditions on the transport and fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) across the stream-riparian interface. In this study, the concentrations and fate of total DOC (TDOC) and a subset of four molecular weight fractions (< 1 kDa, 1-10 kDa, 10-100 kDa, > 100 kDa) were investigated in stream water and riparian groundwater during autumn of 2003 and 2004. The two study periods were characterized by contrasting antecedent hydrological conditions: the streamflow was interrupted in summer 2003 but was permanent in summer 2004. Comparison of the two study periods indicates that an abrupt dry-wet hydrological transition amplifies the water exchange across the stream-riparian interface and favors retention of up to 57% of the TDOC that flows across the interface. Furthermore, the efficiency of DOC retention across the stream-riparian interface also varies greatly depending on DOC molecular size. More than 70% of DOC fractions higher than 10 kDa were retained, whereas the smaller fraction (less than 1 kDa) was nearly conserved. Consequently, our study helps to clarify the effects of extreme hydrological events on DOC transport in running waters in Mediterranean regions.

AB We examined the molecular composition of forest soil water during three different seasons at three different sites, using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). We examined oxic soils and tested the hypothesis that pH and season correlate with the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM). We used molecular formulae and their relative intensity from ESI-FT-ICR-MS for statistical analysis. Applying unconstrained and constrained ordination methods, we observed that pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and season were the main factors correlating with DOM molecular composition. This result is consistent with a previous study where pH was a main driver of the molecular differences between DOM from oxic rivers and anoxic bog systems in the Yenisei River catchment. At a higher pH, the molecular formulae had a lower degree of unsaturation and oxygenation, lower molecular size and a higher abundance of nitrogen-containing compounds. These characteristics suggest a higher abundance of tannin connected to lower pH that possibly inhibited biological decomposition. Higher biological activity at a higher pH might also be related to the higher abundance of nitrogen-containing compounds. Comparing the seasons, we observed a decrease in unsaturation, molecular diversity and the number of nitrogen-containing compounds in the course of the year from March to November. Temperature possibly inhibited biological degradation during winter, which could cause the accumulation of a more diverse compound spectrum until the temperature increased again. Our findings suggest that the molecular composition of DOM in soil pore waters is dynamic and a function of ecosystem activity, pH and temperature.

AB Peatlands are one of the most important carbon cycle regulatory ecosystems, and are influenced by global climate change. However, studies of this kind of wetland are scarce in southern South America. In this study we performed a detailed analysis of recent accumulation rates of carbon (RERCA) in two types of Sphagnum peatland in Isla Grande de Chiloe (Chile) (42 degrees-43 degrees S and 75 degrees-73 degrees W). Monoliths of peat in continuous depths were analyzed and assigned ages using 210 Pb dating. The results showed a difference between the two types of peatland: the average rate for the anthropogenic peatland (107.34 +/- 113.9 g C m(-2) yr(1)) was superior to that of the natural peatland (78.33 +/- 77.1 g C(-2)yr(1)). The surface profiles (30 cm) clearly revealed the recent rate of carbon accumulation for the past 100 years in Sphagnum peatlands of Northern Patagonia. The rate for the natural peatland is within the range found for ombrotrophic peatlands in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the rate estimated for the anthropogenic peatland was significantly greater than those reported in other parts of the world. Our results provide evidence of the importance of these unique ecosystems in the carbon accumulation process.

AB Information on the variation in soil element concentrations at different spatial scales is needed for, e.g., designing efficient sampling strategies, upscaling the processes related to carbon cycling, and planning land use and management. In spite of intensive land use, such information concerning peat soils is still scarce. We analyzed the variation in peat mineral element concentrations in boreal peatland forests drained 50-60 years earlier. We wanted to quantify the proportions of variation deriving from differences between regions and peatland basins and from within-peatland heterogeneity, and to model the variation using relatively easily measurable site and soil characteristics. We utilized 878 peat samples representing the 0-20 cm layer and collected from 289 sites in 79 peatland basins. The sites represented three different drained peatland forest site types. The two strongest gradients in the element composition captured by principal component analysis were correlated with both the North-South gradient and the site type variation, and the East-West gradient. In general, most of the variation in the element concentrations was contributed by differences among peatland basins, and variation within the floristically determined sites. Most of the element concentrations were best modeled when either the bulk density or the ash content of the peat, or both, were used in addition to site type and geographical location. The explanatory power remained modest for most element concentrations. As for the P concentrations in soil, however, our models provide means for estimating a large part of the variation among drained pine mire sites.

AB The importance of northern peatlands in the global carbon cycle has been recognized, especially for long-term changes. Yet, the complex interactions between climate and peatland hydrology, carbon storage, and area dynamics make it challenging to represent these systems in land surface models. This study describes how peatlands are included as an independent sub-grid hydrological soil unit (HSU) in the ORCHIDEE-MICT land surface model. The peatland soil column in this tile is characterized by multilayered vertical water and carbon transport and peat-specific hydrological properties. The cost-efficient version of TOPMODEL and the scheme of peatland initiation and development from the DYPTOP model are implemented and adjusted to simulate spatial and temporal dynamics of peatland. The model is tested across a range of northern peatland sites and for gridded simulations over the Northern Hemisphere (> 30 degrees N). Simulated northern peatland area (3.9 million km(2)), peat carbon stock (463 Pg C), and peat depth are generally consistent with observed estimates of peatland area (3.4-4.0 million km2), peat carbon (270-540 Pg C), and data compilations of peat core depths. Our results show that both net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) of northern peatlands increased over the past century in response to CO2 and climate change. NPP increased more rapidly than HR, and thus net ecosystem production (NEP) exhibited a positive trend, contributing a cumulative carbon storage of 11.13 PgC since 1901, most of it being realized after the 1950s.

AB Soil microbes favour easily decomposable organic compounds, and, consequently, soil organic matter tends to enrich with recalcitrant carbon compounds. In theory, this leads to an increasing temperature sensitivity of decomposition towards older fractions of soil organic matter. We tested this theory in a Sphagnum peat profile. This profile was particularly suitable for this purpose because the age of organic matter increased with depth. The age correlated closely with the degree of decomposition in the oxic layer and soil minerals did not interfere with the relationship between the age and the temperature sensitivity of decomposition. We sampled and analysed the peat profile by layer. We took laboratory measurements of chemical characteristics, decomposability and temperature sensitivity of decomposition. We used the bomb-C-14 isotopic tracer to differentiate the sources of respired CO2 into age-classes and to estimate the temperature sensitivity of the oldest fraction in each layer. We also used the natural abundance ratio of stable carbon isotopes as an indicator of the recalcitrance of the decomposing carbon fraction. The measurements showed that the decomposition of the older and more recalcitrant carbon compounds was enhanced more in response to increasing temperature than was the decomposition of the younger and more labile compounds. Our results support the theory tested and indicate that the temperature sensitivity of decomposition increases with depth, age and recalcitrance in the oxic layer of the studied peat profile.

AB A high-resolution fen peat record and 79 basal peat dates from paludified peatlands in continental western Canada provide evidence for cyclic change in moisture conditions and in peat carbon accumulation. The ash-free bulk density, a proxy for degree of peat decomposition and thus moisture conditions, shows periodicities at both millennial ( from 1500 to 2190 yr, with a mean of 1785 yr) and century scales ( 386 yr and 667 yr). Wet periods of 200 - 600 yr in duration, especially at similar to 6900, 5500 and 4000 cal. BP, correlate with rapid peat accumulation, new peatland initiation and declines in the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The wet periods in western North America are coeval with warm periods in the North Atlantic, a phasing relationship that has been documented in other published palaeorecords for the glacial period and late Holocene, probably in response to variations in solar activity. These results indicate a strong connection between climate and the global carbon cycle at the millennial scale, mediated in part by peatland dynamics. This is the first demonstration that peatland carbon sequestration rates are highly sensitive even to minor climatic fluctuations, which are too small to produce detectable changes in major species in the peatland. That global atmospheric CO2 concentrations have in the past responded to these changes in peatland dynamics implies a strong potential for peatlands to be a major player in affecting future global change.

AB Hydraulic conductivity (K) is a key but problematic parameter in groundwater models particularly those that simulate flow in weak, readily deformable media, such as peat deposits. As a result, K represents a critical source of error in models that couple hydrological processes with the carbon balance of peatlands, a globally important source for greenhouse gases. We therefore conducted mini-aquifer tests on two mesoscale bog landforms within the large 1300 km(2) Red Lake Peatland of northern Minnesota. These tests offer the dual advantage of determining the fine-scale distribution of K within a large (>900 m(3)) model domain. In addition, the stress created by a 24 h pumping operation should be capable of mobilizing pools of biogenic gases thoughout a deep peat deposit. The pumping results were monitored by 24 to 38 wells in order to calibrate a 3D finite-volume groundwater model with the aid of PEST (Parameter Estimation Analysis). High K values were determined at a Bog Forest (10(-5) to 10(-6) m s(-1)) and Bog Lawn (10(-3) to 10(-4) m s(-1)) sites, throughout their deep (>4 m) peat profiles. These tests also detected vertically continuous zones of unexpectedly high or low K values in contrast to the horizontal bedding planes and increasing degree of decomposition with depth. The vertical K zones are suggestive of three different modes of bubble transport that either locally dilate or partially block the peat pores. In addition, the tests provided new insights on a conceptual model linking K to the development of all large (>20 km(2)) forested bog complexes in mid-continental boreal North America.

AB We determined the landscape variation of forest floor (FF) CO2 uptake (photosynthesis, P), FF CO2 emission (respiration, R) in relation to net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and environmental factors along a forest-mire ecotone in Finland. The 450 m long ecotone extended from xeric, upland pine dominated habitats, through spruce and transitional spruce-pine-birch forest, to sedge peatlands downslope. The CO2 fluxes were measured at nine stations during 2005 using chamber and IR techniques. Instantaneous P and R measurements for each station were interpolated by fitting their response to continuous records of light (mean R-2 = 0.66) and temperature (mean R-2 = 0.77) recorded nearby to give annual estimates. Stand biomass increment was used to estimate the annual CO2 exchange contribution of the trees. Annual P values from -307 to -1632 gCO(2)m(-2)yr(-1) were inversely correlated with FF light (r = -0.96), FF above-ground biomass (r = -0.92) and canopy openness (r = -0.95). Annual R values from 1263 to 2813 gCO(2) m(-2) yr(-1) were correlated with tree stand foliar biomass (r = 0.77). Estimated NEE values varied from 546 to -1679 gCO(2)m(-2)/yr(-1), with P contributing from -307 to -1632 gCO(2)m(-2)yr(-1) (4-90%) to gross ecosystem photosynthetic production (GPP), and R from 1263 to 2813 gCO(2)m(-2)yr(-1) (70-98%) to gross ecosystem respiration (GR).

AB We compared nitrogen (N) storage and flux in soils from an ombrotrophic bog with that of a minerotrophic ten to quantity the differences in N cycling between these two peatlands types in northern Minnesota (USA). Precipitation, atmospheric deposition, and bog and ten outflows were analyzed for nitrogen species. Upland and peatland soil samples were analyzed for N content, and for ambient (DN) and potential (DEA) denitrification rates. Annual atmospheric deposition was: 0.88-3.07 kg NH4+ ha(-1) y(-1); 1.37-1.42 kg NO3- ha(-1) y(-1); 2.79-4.69 kg TN ha(-1) y(-1). Annual N outflows were: bog -0.01-0.04 kg NH4+ ha(-1) y(-1), NO3- 0.01-0.06 kg ha(-1) y(-1) and TN 0.11-0.69 kg ha(-1) y(-1); fen-NH4+ 0.01-0.16 kg ha(-1) y(-1), NO3- 0.29-0.48 kg ha(-1) y(-1), and TN 1.14-1.61 kg ha(-1) y(-1). Soil N content depended on location within the bog or fen, and on soil depth. DN and DEA rates were low throughout the uplands and peatlancls, and were correlated with atmospheric N deposition, soil N storage, and N outflow. DEA was significantly greater than DN indicating C or N limitation of the denitrification process. We highlight differences between the bog and fen, between the upland mineral soils and peat, and the importance of biogeochemical hotspots within the peatlands. We point out the importance of organic N storage, as a source of N for denitrification, and propose a plausible link between organic N storage, denitrification and N export from peatlands. Finally, we considered the interactions of microbial metabolism with nutrient availability and stoichiometry, and how N dynamics might be affected by climate change in peatland ecosystems.

AB We used a biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), to study the net methane (CH4) fluxes between Alaskan ecosystems and the atmosphere. We estimated that the current net emissions of CH4 (emissions minus consumption) from Alaskan soils are; similar to 3 Tg CH4/yr. Wet tundra ecosystems are responsible for 75% of the region's net emissions, while dry tundra and upland boreal forests are responsible for 50% and 45% of total consumption over the region, respectively. In response to climate change over the 21st century, our simulations indicated that CH4 emissions from wet soils would be enhanced more than consumption by dry soils of tundra and boreal forests. As a consequence, we projected that net CH4 emissions will almost double by the end of the century in response to high-latitude warming and associated climate changes. When we placed these CH4 emissions in the context of the projected carbon budget (carbon dioxide [CO2] and CH4) for Alaska at the end of the 21st century, we estimated that Alaska will be a net source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere of 69 Tg CO2 equivalents/yr, that is, a balance between net methane emissions of 131 Tg CO2 equivalents/yr and carbon sequestration of 17 Tg C/yr (62 Tg CO2 equivalents/yr).

AB Estimates of the storage and flux of shelf carbon in vegetation, soils, carbonates, and organic matter during the period of the marine transgression since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 18 ka are presented. Whereas at present each square metre of land on the planet carries about 10.65 kg of carbon in vegetation and soils, during the LGM most areas of exposed continental shelf carried relatively little carbon, probably about 5.86 kg C m(-2), but this increased to a maximum density of 15.49 kg C m(-2) after 10 ka when conditions generally favoured peat deposition and forest development. in the ensuing sea level rise up until mid-Holocene time this large store of carbon was displaced. Assuming an average value of 10.65 kg m(-2) carbon (combining the land lost to sea-level rise before and after 13 ka), a transgression covering 15-23 x 10(2) m(2) would mean that 160 to 245 Gigatons of Carbon (1 Gt=10(12) kg) were lost from the terrestrial system at the same time that the remainder of the terrestrial biosphere was still taking up organic carbon. This additional and opposite flux from the land system must be taken into account when considering changes in the global carbon cycle and CO2 fluxes. Moreover, it complicates the interpretation of the ocean carbon isotope record. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Methanogenic degradation of organic matter at low temperature is quite important for CH4 turnover on a global scale.  This is performed by psychrophilic microbial community.  Consecutive degradation of the elective substrates at low temperature indicates the bottle-necks and changes in the matter flow in the cold regions.
   Degradation of 38 substrates at temperatures 6-degrees, 15-degrees, 28-degrees-C (a control) was observed during a year.  It was found that cellulose decomposition at 6-degrees and 15-degrees has a normal pattern but slows down twice with Q10.  Butyric and proponic acid fermentations were quite pronounced at low temperature.  Syntrophic phase in decomposition was particularly suppressed by low temperature.  Acetoclastic methanogenesis is characteristic for most substrates but it is very slow.  C1-rout of methanogenesis is less affected by low temperature.  The main change is the dominance of homoacetic bacteria which successfully compete with methanogens at low temperature for H-2, formiate.  This leads to accumulation of acetate which is used slowly in acetoclastic methanogenesis.  The growth rate is most affected by low temperature which lead to unusually long lag-phase with exponential outburst after months.  It means that accumulation of active biomass at low temperature is a prerequisite for normal process of degradation.  Slow anaerobic degradation of organic compounds at low temperature makes a cold-trap in carbon cycle and represent a sink for CO2 because of inability for bacteria to degrade syntrophically decomposable compounds.

AB Coastal wetlands are susceptible to loss in both health and extent via stressors associated with global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Peat collapse may represent an additional phenomenon contributing to coastal wetland loss in organic-rich soils through rapid vertical elevation decline. However, the term "peat collapse" has been inconsistently used in the literature, leading to ambiguities regarding the mechanisms, timing, and spatial extent of its contribution to coastal wetland loss. For example, it is unclear whether peat collapse is distinct from general subsidence, or what biogeochemical changes or sequence of events may constitute peat collapse. A critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature related to peat collapse was supplemented with fundamental principles of soil physics and biogeochemistry to develop a conceptual framework for coastal wetland peat collapse. We propose that coastal wetland peat collapse is a specific type of shallow subsidence unique to highly organic soils in which a loss of soil strength and structural integrity contributes to a decline in elevation, over the course of a few months to a few years, below the lower limit for emergent plant growth and natural recovery. We further posit that coastal wetland peat collapse is driven by severe stress or death of the vegetation, which compromises the supportive structure roots provide to low-density organic soils and shifts the carbon balance of the ecosystem toward a net source, as mineralization is no longer offset by sequestration. Under these conditions, four mechanisms may contribute to peat collapse: (1) compression of gas-filled pore spaces within the soil during dry-down conditions; (2) deconsolidation of excessively waterlogged peat, followed by transport; (3) compaction of aerenchyma tissue in wetland plant roots, and possibly collapse of root channels; and (4) acceleration of soil mineralization due to the addition of labile carbon (dying roots), oxygen (decreased flooding), nutrients (eutrophication), or sulfate (saltwater intrusion). Scientists and land managers should focus efforts on monitoring vegetation health across the coastal landscape as an indicator for peat collapse vulnerability and move toward codifying the term "peat collapse" in the scientific literature. Once clarified, the contribution of peat collapse to coastal wetland loss can be evaluated.

AB Methanogens (domain Archaea) have a unique role in the carbon cycle as producers of the greenhouse gas methane (CH(4)). Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is a vital enzyme in CH(4) production, and the mcrA gene coding for a subunit of MCR has been employed as a specific marker for the detection and differentiation of methanogen communities. A critical step in assessing environmental mcrA diversity is the selection of PCR primers. The objective of this study was to compare the diversity coverage of three published mcrA primer sets MCR, ME and ML (also known as MCR and Luton-mcrA) and their ability to discern methanogen communities in a drained peatland. The primers were applied to DNA extracts from unfertilised and ash-fertilised peat from two different depths. Amplified mcrA communities were cloned and sequenced, and the sequences were divided into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analysis. All primers recovered characteristic OTUs associated with the peat depths and treatments and confirmed a previous observation of low methanogen diversity. The minor differences in OTU ranges of the primers did not greatly affect the observed community composition. However, as the proportions of several OTUs varied strongly, the primers provided different quantitative representations of mcrA communities. We concluded that the ML and MCR primers had better amplification ranges than the ME set, but the use of MCR with peat samples was problematic due to poor amplification. Consequently, the ML primers were best suited for mcrA analysis of peatland methanogen communities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The moss layer transfer technique removes the top layer of vegetation from donor sites as a method to transfer propagules and restore degraded or reclaimed peatlands. As this technique is new, little is known about the impacts of moss layer transfer on vegetation and carbon fluxes following harvest. We monitored growing season carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes as well as plant communities at donor sites and neighbouring natural peatland sites in an ombrotrophic bog and minerotrophic fen in Alberta, Canada from which material was harvested between 1 and 6 years prior to the study. Plant recovery at all donor sites was rapid with an average of 72% total plant cover one growing season after harvest at the fen and an average of 87% total plant cover two growing seasons after harvest at the bog. Moss cover also returned, averaging 84% 6 years after harvest at the bog. The majority of natural peatlands in western Canada are treed and tree recruitment at the donor sites was limited. Methane emissions were higher from donor sites compared to natural sites due to the high water table and greater sedge cover. Carbon budgets suggested that the donor fen and bog sites released higher CO2 and CH4 over the growing season compared to adjacent natural sites. However, vegetation re-establishment on donor sites was rapid, and it is possible that these sites will return to their original carbon-cycle functioning after disturbance, suggesting that donor sites may recover naturally without implementing management strategies.

At experimental sites Lelystad and Zegveld - predominantly Lolium perenne L. at a clay and peat soil, respectively - measurements will be made on (1) net CO2 assimilation of the grassland vegetation using infrared ps analysis; (2) carbon distribution within the plant using C-14 pulse labeling; and (3) carbon and CO2 fluxes associated with root respiration and soil organic matter decomposition using C-14 pulse labeling. At both sites and at experimental site Cabauw additional measurements will be made on total CO2 fluxes between the grassland vegetation and the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer. For the analysis of the experimental results and generalisation of the relationships between carbon fluxes and environmental and plant factors use will be made of dynamic simulation models of grass growth and soil organic matter dynamics.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT
AB Peat is an important carbon sink in the context of climate change. However, well-documented examples suggest that risk of peat erosion is widespread and significant. Our understanding of peat vulnerability to erosion is commonly constrained by the complexity of drivers, and their interactions, in this process. However, the key constraints are: limited, consistent and comprehensive quantitative data relating to this process and, more significantly, the explicit relationships between the occurrence of peat erosion and its causes and drivers. Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) provide a methodology for integrating qualitative and quantitative knowledge. BBNs can capture and structure available knowledge and rationalize complex interactions, where empirical data are limited or poorly compatible and processes are complex or uncertain. In this article we explore the BBN potential to advance our understanding and to identify gaps in current knowledge. BBN has been demonstrated to be a useful tool in structuring and utilizing currently available knowledge, often with limited evidence, of peat's actual exposure to erosive forces. Despite considerable research into peat erosion processes and understanding the inherent vulnerability of peat, results presented indicate clear gaps in knowledge regarding the role of land management, spatially explicit data related to land management as well as limited evidence of the relevant relationships between many of the variables. The attention of further research will focus on these gaps. The BBN approach provides a framework in which different scenarios of biophysical, climatic and land management (social and economic) conditions can examine and assess the probability of erosion.

AB Here we present results from a new method for detecting changes in atmospheric CO2 based on delta(13)C analyses of selected peat components from a peat core in southern South America. The paleo-CO2-record has decadal resolution spanning the last 14,000 radiocarbon years and compares well with Antarctic ice core CO2 data Sharp peaks in CO2 are detected during the late glacial, specifically at 10,200, 11,600 and 12,900 yeats B.P. When compared to two deep-sea records interpreted to reflect changes in thermohaline circulation, these CO2 pulses appear to relate to degassing events of the ocean associated with reinitiation of the thermohaline circulation occurring at this time. Concomitant decreases in atmospheric Delta(14)C during the late glacial are also consistent with a deep oceanic carbon source for the large atmospheric pulses in CO2. Results from a simple three-box model indicate that the magnitude of the CO2 released during these degassing events is compatible with our observations. The rate of degassing, however, is much slower than that observed in the paleo-CO2-record. Two broad Holocene CO2 excursions are also identified with peaks at 4,200 and 7,700 years B.P. The driving mechanism behind these excursions appear to be different than those in the late glacial.

AB The effects of increased nitrogen influx on Sphagnum growth and on interspecific competition between Sphagnum species were studied in a 3-yr experiment in mires situated in two areas with different rates of airborne N deposition. Sphagnum growth was recorded after various supplementary N influxes (0, 1, 3, 5 and 10 g m(-2) yr(-1)) in hummocks and lawn communities. Sphagnum biomass production decreased with increasing N influx in both areas. After the first season at the low-deposition site, Sphagnum showed an increased growth in length with the intermediate N treatment, but in the second and third seasons the control treatment had the highest growth in length. Capitulum dry mass increased with increasing N influx. Sphagnum N concentration and N/P quotient were higher at the high- than at the low-deposition site. The low quotient at the low-deposition site, together with the initial growth increase with intermediate N supplements, indicates that growth was N-limited at this site, but our lowest N supplement was sufficient to reduce growth. The N treatments had no effect on interspecific competition between the Sphagnum species. This indicates that the species have similar responses to N. The species studied all occur naturally on ombrotrophic, N-poor sites and show low tolerances to increased N influx. Reduced Sphagnum production mag. affect the carbon balance, changing the mires from C sinks to sources.

AB Peatlands are large terrestrial stores of carbon, and sustained CO2 sinks, but over the last century large areas have been drained for agriculture and forestry, potentially converting them into net carbon sources. More recently, some peatlands have been re-wetted by blocking drainage ditches, with the aims of enhancing biodiversity, mitigating flooding, and promoting carbon storage. One potential detrimental consequence of peatland re-wetting is an increase in methane (CH4) emissions, offsetting the benefits of increased CO2 sequestration. We examined differences in CH4 emissions between an area of ditch-drained blanket bog, and an adjacent area where drainage ditches were recently infilled. Results showed that Eriophorum vaginatum colonization led to a "hotspot'' of CH4 emissions from the infilled ditches themselves, with smaller increases in CH4 from other re-wetted areas. Extrapolated to the area of blanket bog surrounding the study site, we estimated that CH4 emissions were around 60 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) prior to drainage, reducing to 44 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1) after drainage. We calculated that fully re-wetting this area would initially increase emissions to a peak of around 120 kg CH4 ha(-1) y(-1), with around two-thirds of the increase (and 90% of the increase over pre-drainage conditions) attributable to CH4 emissions from E. vaginatum-colonized infilled ditches, despite these areas only occupying 7% of the landscape. We predicted that emissions should eventually decline toward pre-drainage values as the ecosystem recovers, but only if Sphagnum mosses displace E. vaginatum from the infilled ditches. These results have implications for peatland management for climate change mitigation, suggesting that restoration methods should aim, if possible, to avoid the colonization of infilled ditches by aerenchymatous species such as E. vaginatum, and to encourage Sphagnum establishment.

AB Peatlands of all latitudes play an integral role in global climate change by serving as a carbon sink and a primary source of atmospheric methane; however, the microbial ecology of mid-latitude peatlands is vastly understudied. Herein, next generation Illumina amplicon sequencing of small subunit rRNA genes was utilized to elucidate the microbial communities in three southern Appalachian peatlands. In contrast to northern peatlands, Proteobacteria dominated over Acidobacteria in all three sites. An average of 11 bacterial phyla was detected at relative abundance values >1%, with three candidate divisions (OP3, WS3 and NC10) represented, indicating high phylogenetic diversity. Physiological traits of isolates within the candidate alphaproteobacterial order, Ellin 329, obtained here and in previous studies indicate that bacteria of this order may be involved in hydrolysis of poly-, di- and monosaccharides. Community analyses indicate that Ellin 329 is the third most abundant order and is most abundant near the surface layers where plant litter decomposition should be primarily occurring. In sum, members of Ellin 329 likely play important roles in organic matter decomposition, in southern Appalachian peatlands and should be investigated further in other peatlands and ecosystem types.

AB Partially decomposed plant and animal remains have been accumulating in organic soils (i.e. >40% C content) for millennia, making them the largest terrestrial carbon store. There is growing concern that, in a warming world, soil biotic processing will accelerate and release greenhouse gases that further exacerbate climate change. However, the magnitude of this response remains uncertain as the constraints are abiotic, biotic and interactive. Here, we examined the influence of resource quality and biological activity on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration under different soil moisture regimes. Organic soils were sampled from 13 boreal and peatland ecosystems located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Finland and Sweden, representing a natural resource quality range of C, N and P. They were incubated at four temperatures (4, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C) at either 60% or 100% water holding capacity (WHC). Our results showed that chemical and biological properties play an important role in determining soil respiration responses to temperature and moisture changes. High soil C : P and C : N ratios were symptomatic of slow C turnover and long-term C accumulation. In boreal soils, low bacterial to fungal ratios were related to greater temperature sensitivity of respiration, which was amplified in drier conditions. This contrasted with peatland soils which were dominated by bacterial communities and enchytraeid grazing, resulting in a more rapid C turnover under warmer and wetter conditions. The unexpected acceleration of C mineralization under high moisture contents was possibly linked to the primarily role of fermented organic matter, instead of oxygen, in mediating microbial decomposition. We conclude that to improve C model simulations of soil respiration, a better resolution of the interactions occurring between climate, resource quality and the decomposer community will be required.

AB Peat soils consist of poorly decomposed plant detritus, preserved by low decay rates, and deep peat deposits are globally significant stores in the carbon cycle. High water tables and low soil temperatures are commonly held to be the primary reasons for low peat decay rates. However, recent studies suggest a thermodynamic limit to peat decay, whereby the slow turnover of peat soil pore water may lead to high concentrations of phenols and dissolved inorganic carbon. In sufficient concentrations, these chemicals may slow or even halt microbial respiration, providing a negative feedback to peat decay. We document the analysis of a simple, one-dimensional theoretical model of peatland pore water residence time distributions (RTDs). The model suggests that broader, thicker peatlands may be more resilient to rapid decay caused by climate change because of slow pore water turnover in deep layers. Even shallow peat deposits may also be resilient to rapid decay if rainfall rates are low. However, the model suggests that even thick peatlands may be vulnerable to rapid decay under prolonged high rainfall rates, which may act to flush pore water with fresh rainwater. We also used the model to illustrate a particular limitation of the diplotelmic (i.e., acrotelm and catotelm) model of peatland structure. Model peatlands of contrasting hydraulic structure exhibited identical water tables but contrasting RTDs. These scenarios would be treated identically by diplotelmic models, although the thermodynamic limit suggests contrasting decay regimes. We therefore conclude that the diplotelmic model be discarded in favor of model schemes that consider continuous variation in peat properties and processes.

AB To date, the areal extent, carbon pools, rate of carbon accumulation, and role of peatlands of the former Soviet Union (FSU) in the terrestrial carbon cycle has not been fully recognized. This is a consequence of the fact that many peatlands in the FSU, especially noncommercial peatlands, were never studied and properly mapped. An estimate of the areal extent, carbon pools, and rate of carbon accumulation in peatlands of the FSU obtained by interrelating a number of regional databases and maps, including formerly classified maps, is presented herein. Commercial peatlands were categorized by regional type which facilitated an evaluation of their age and quality. Noncommercial peatlands were evaluated from classified regional topographic maps. Air photographs were used to identify peatIands of northern landscapes. The total peatland area of the FSU was estimated at 165 Mba (10(6) hectares) which was two times greater than the most recent estimates based on thematic maps. The peat carbon pool was estimated at 215 Pg C. Half of this amount was in raised bogs. The rate of peat accumulation varied from 12 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (polygonal mires) to 72-80 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (fens and marshes). The total rate of carbon accumulation in FSU peatlands was 52 Tg C yr(-1). Carbon emissions from peat utilization in the FSU were estimated at 122 Tg C yr(-1). Thus, at present, peat accumulation/utilization in the FSU is a net source of approximately 70 Tg C yr(-1) to the atmosphere.

AB Negative carbon-isotope excursions have been comprehensively studied in the stratigraphic record but the discussion of causal mechanisms has largely overlooked the potential role of biomass burning. The carbon-isotopic ratios (delta C-13) of vegetation, soil organic matter and peat are significantly lower than atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and thereby provide a source of low C-13 CO2 when combusted. In this study, the potential role of biomass burning to generate negative carbon isotope excursions associated with greenhouse climates is modeled. Results indicate that major peat combustion sustained for 1000 yr increases atmospheric CO2 from 2.5x present atmospheric levels (PAL) to 4.6x PAL, and yields a pronounced negative delta C-13 excursion in the atmosphere (similar to 2.4 parts per thousand), vegetation (similar to 2.4 parts per thousand) and the surface ocean (similar to 1.2 parts per thousand), but not for the deep ocean (similar to 0.9 parts per thousand). Release Of CO2 initiates a short-term warming of the atmosphere (up to 14.4 degrees C, with a duration of 1628 yr), which is consistent with the magnitude and length of an observed Toarcian excursion event. These results indicate that peat combustion is a plausible mechanism for driving negative delta C-13 excursions in the rock record, even during times of elevated rho CO2. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The ongoing expansion of shrub cover in response to climate change represents a unique opportunity to explore the link between soil microbial communities and vegetation changes. This link is particularly important in peatlands where shrub expansion is expected to feed back negatively on the carbon sink capacity of these ecosystems. Microbial community structure and function were measured seasonally in four peatlands located along an altitude gradient representing a natural gradient of climate and associated vascular plant abundance. We show that increased soil temperature and reduced water content are associated with greater vascular plant biomass, in particular that of ericoids, and that this, in turn, is correlated with greater microbial biomass. More specifically, microbial community structure is characterized by an increasing dominance of fungi over bacteria with improved soil oxygenation. We also found that the carbon and nitrogen stoichiometry of microbial biomass differs in relation to soil microbial community structure and that this is ultimately associated with a different investment in extracellular enzymatic activity. Our findings highlight the fact that the determination of the structural identity of microbial communities can help to explain the biogeochemical dynamics of organic matter and provide a better understanding of ecosystem response to environmental changes.

AB Because climate change can affect the carbon balance and hydrology in permafrost peatlands, a better understanding of their sensitivity to changes in temperature and precipitation is needed. In Tavvavuoma, northernmost Sweden, meteorological parameters and ground thermal properties have been monitored in a peat plateau from 2006 to 2013. During this time period, the air temperature record shows no warming trend, and the late-season thaw depth has been relatively stable at around 55-60cm. Meanwhile, the mean annual ground temperature at 1m depth has increased by 0.06 degrees C/yr and at 2-5m depth the permafrost is currently warmer than -0.3 degrees C. Statistical analyses suggest that interannual changes in thaw depth and ground temperatures are affected by different meteorological factors. Summer air temperatures and annual thawing degree-days control thaw depth (p0.05), whereas winter precipitation/snow depth affects ground temperatures (p0.1). The permafrost in this peat plateau is likely relict and not in equilibrium with current climatic conditions. Since the early 20(th) century, there has been a regional increase in air temperature and snow depth. If the ongoing permafrost warming in Tavvavuoma is a result of these long-term trends, short-term variability in meteorological parameters can still have an impact on the rate of permafrost degradation, but unless pronounced climate cooling occurs, thawing of the peat plateau is inevitable.

AB The mineral-bound organic matter (OM) in soils is of great importance for the global carbon cycle. Long-standing debate exists regarding the mechanisms of soil organic matter (SOM) preservation and, especially, the role of organo-clay mineral associations. Investigation of such associations is rarely undertaken in peat soils. In this study, we examine organo-clay relationships in the Dajiuhu peat soil in Hubei Province, central China, based on molecular markers, which allows for understanding of rates of OM degradation and the preservation of OM associated with clay minerals. We analyzed the major and trace element chemistry, clay mineralogy, and lipid compositions of both the coarse- and clay-sized fractions of the soil. The uniformity of trace element and REE distribution patterns in the soil (except for Layer 2) suggests that the source materials were well mixed. Chemical index of alteration (CIA) values of 70-85 indicate moderate to strong weathering processes. A significant correlation between C-org:P and TOC may indicate that redox conditions were a significant control on OM preservation. The clay fraction of Dajiuhu peatland soils also has played an important role in preserving OM, especially in anoxic environments. Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis show that OM is absorbed mainly on the edges of illite grains rather than in interlayer sites. The amphoteric margins of illite crystals allow them to more effectively bind organic compounds. The high R-1/h ratio, high carbon preference index (CPI), and high ratio of unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acids (C-18:2/C-18) in the clay sized fraction provide further biomarker evidence that illite efficiently protects OM from biodegradation, thus enhancing the OM content of soils.

AB Oceanic island flora is vulnerable to future climate warming, which is likely to promote changes in vegetation composition, and invasion of non-native species. Sub-Antarctic islands are predicted to experience rapid warming during the next century; therefore, establishing trajectories of change in vegetation communities is essential for developing conservation strategies to preserve biological diversity. We present a Late-glacial-early Holocene (16 500-6450 cal a bp) palaeoecological record from Hooker's Point, Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), South Atlantic. This period spans the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, providing insight into biological responses to abrupt climate change. Pollen and plant macrofossil records appear insensitive to climatic cooling during the Late-glacial, but undergo rapid turnover in response to regional warming. The absence of trees throughout the Late-glacial-early Holocene enables the recognition of far-travelled pollen from southern South America. The first occurrence of Nothofagus (southern beech) may reflect changes in the strength and/or position of the Southern Westerly Wind Belt during the Late-glacial period. Peat inception and accumulation at Hooker's Point is likely to be promoted by the recalcitrant litter of wind-adapted flora. This recalcitrant litter helps to explain widespread peatland development in a comparatively dry environment, and suggests that wind-adapted peatlands can remain carbon sinks even under low precipitation regimes.

AB Prior studies have shown that silicon (Si) increases the dissolution of iron (Fe) phosphates, releasing phosphorus (P) into the soil solution of fen peat and thereby changing the composition of organic matter (OM). We formulated three questions on the occurring processes: [i] Does high Si concentration cause a mobilization of Fe phosphates? [ii] Does this mobilization result in a higher concentration of P, Fe, and dissolved organic carbon? [iii] Are there changes in the composition of organic matter?
   To this end, we conducted a laboratory experiment adding amorphous silica to fen peat and analyzed Fe mineralogy and carbon quality of the peat material by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).
   Under high Si concentration, significantly higher concentrations of P and Fe were found in soil solution. Moreover, XAS data indicated a dissolution of Fe (II) phosphates and a change in the composition of OM available to microbes with decreasing contributions of carboxylic groups and quinones.
   We propose to explain the effects as follows: under high Si concentration Fe (II) phosphates dissolve and OM rich in carboxylic groups are mobilized. As the nutrient concentration in the soil solution increased, the degradation of oxidized components of the OM, such as quinones and carboxylic groups is enhanced.

AB The retention of peatland carbon (C) and the ability to continue to draw down and store C from the atmosphere is not only important for the UK terrestrial carbon inventory, but also for a range of ecosystem services, the landscape value and the ecology and hydrology of similar to 15% of the land area of the UK. Here we review the current state of knowledge on the C balance of UK peatlands using several studies which highlight not only the importance of making good flux measurements, but also the spatial and temporal variability of different flux terms that characterise a landscape affected by a range of natural and anthropogenic processes and threats. Our data emphasise the importance of measuring (or accurately estimating) all components of the peatland C budget. We highlight the role of the aquatic pathway and suggest that fluxes are higher than previously thought. We also compare the contemporary C balance of several UK peatlands with historical rates of C accumulation measured using peat cores, thus providing a long-term context for present-day measurements and their natural year-on-year variability. Contemporary measurements from 2 sites suggest that current accumulation rates (-56 to -72 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) are at the lower end of those seen over the last 150 yr in peat cores (-35 to -209 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Finally, we highlight significant current gaps in knowledge and identify where levels of uncertainty are high, as well as emphasise the research challenges that need to be addressed if we are to improve the measurement and prediction of change in the peatland C balance over future decades.

AB Plant functional types (PFTs) are used to make generalizations in modeling how plants impact ecosystem functioning. In boreal bogs the number of plant species is small, but several PFTs are represented, namely sedges, deciduous and evergreen dwarf-shrubs, as well as hummock, lawn, and hollow Sphagna. Despite the use of PFTs in modeling, the value of PFTs to describe the photosynthetic properties of bog plants has not been systematically studied. We aim to quantify the photosynthetic properties of typical bog plant species and assess how well PFT divisions reflect differences among species. We measured photosynthetic light response and physiological state of photosystem II of 19 species, monthly, over a growing season. Differences were assessed using principal component analysis and mixed models. Photosynthetic properties separated Sphagna into traditional PFTs, of which hollow species had the highest gross photosynthesis. Sphagnum photosynthesis had large seasonal variation, as monthly differences exceeded those among PFTs or species. The photosynthetic properties of vascular plants differed widely among species but did not follow traditional PFTs. Vascular plant seasonal changes were of less importance than interspecific differences. The results justify using PFTs to describe the ability of bog Sphagna to bind carbon, but do not justify the same approach for vascular plants.

AB Soils in the northern circumpolar region play a central role in the global carbon cycle because the release of carbon through permafrost thaw and geomorphological disturbances can potentially cause a feedback on climate. However, large uncertainties in estimates of permafrost carbon stocks remain, mainly because of wide gaps in the spatial coverage of soil carbon sampling sites and the large mapping polygons used to upscale data. By combining mapping of landforms and knowledge of surficial geology to upscale soil carbon content measurements, we provide an assessment of soil total carbon content in the region of the Narsajuaq river valley (Nunavik, Canada) to generate the first highesolution soil carbon estimate confirmed by field measurements in Nunavik. We estimate that the Narsajuaq river valley and the surrounding uplands have a weighted average of 3.4 kg C m(-2) (0-100 cm), with 73% of the total carbon content stored in the top 30 cm. The results also indicate that the valley is a carbon hotspot in the region, containing 76% of the total carbon content (0-100 cm) of the study area. Although soil carbon estimates will always require field sampling, the geomorphological mapping approach can significantly improve carbon content estimates and provide better inputs for models.

AB Soil processes in high-latitude regions during winter are important contributors to global carbon circulation, but our understanding of the mechanisms controlling these processes is poor and observed temperature response coefficients of CO2 production in frozen soils deviate markedly from thermodynamically predicted responses ( sometimes by several orders of magnitude). We investigated the temperature response of CO2 production in 23 unfrozen and frozen surface soil samples from various types of boreal forests and peatland ecosystems and also measured changes in water content in them after freezing. We demonstrate that deviations in temperature responses at subzero temperatures primarily emanates from water deficiency caused by freezing of the soil water, and that the amount of unfrozen water is mainly determined by the quality of the soil organic matter, which is linked to the vegetation cover. Factoring out the contribution of water limitation to the CO2 temperature responses yields response coefficients that agree well with expectations based on thermodynamic theory concerning biochemical temperature responses. This partitioning between a pure temperature response and the effect of water availability on the response of soil CO2 production at low temperatures is crucial for a thorough understanding of low-temperature soil processes and for accurate predictions of C-balances in northern terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Peatlands are essential ecosystems in global carbon cycle. However, they have been drained for economic benefits for centuries; large peatland areas have turned from carbon storage ecosystems to the carbon emitters. Because of the slow spontaneous revegetation of abandoned extracted peatlands, there is urgent need for their active restoration, required also for mitigation of global climate change effects. The selection ofSphagnumspecies suitable for restoration may also have crucial effects to reach the restoration aims. In 2012, we began a restoration experiment in abandoned extracted peatland in central Estonia. We aimed to elucidate whetherSphagnumspecies, specific to natural North European bogs, have different growth characteristics under altered growth conditions in restored extracted peatland. We studied growth characteristics ofS. fuscum,S. medium, andS. rubellumat restoration sites with two different water table levels and in two natural bogs. We estimated total cover ofSphagnumcarpet and cover of three target species and measured shoot growth characteristics at each site. Linear models with correlated errors were used for temporal trends studies. Our results showed that studiedSphagnumspecies have different growth characteristics in restoration sites and that the main growth promoter is the water table depth (WTD). Results showed that greaterSphagnumcover (over 70%) can be achieved in wetter conditions with WTD higher than circa 20 cm. On wetter restoration sitesS. mediumandS. fuscumcould be recommended for restoration, whereasS. fuscumperform well also in drier sites.

AB Many upland catchments in the UK have undergone afforestation; their characteristic waterlogged soils require extensive pre-plantation ground drainage to allow tree establishment. In peatland areas this can result in very highly coloured runoff and enhanced dissolved organic matter (DOM) export in rivers of naturally high concentrations. In 1966, the Coalburn Experimental Catchment, northern England, was established to investigate the impact of afforestation on an upland peat catchment. Here we report the variations in DOM spectrophotometric properties of streamflow in the catchment at canopy closure, especially with respect to potential carbon sources within the artificial drainage ditches. Drainage ditches are characterized by water that has higher absorption coefficients and which is more highly coloured than in the catchment tributaries. Ditched, afforested areas produce more highly-coloured runoff waters that are more fluorescent and absorbent normalized to carbon concentration compared to ditches in open moorland. Ditches that had been experimentally re-excavated have organic matter of different spectrophotometric character, with higher dissolved organic carbon concentration and less aromatic or lower molecular weight material. It is hypothesized that this is due to the exposure of bare peat faces within and adjacent to the ditches that are more susceptible to drying compared to vegetated areas. The large extent of this drainage network acts as both a rapid transport network increasing hydrological connectivity and a pool for the storage of DOM, which is of different spectrophotometric character under low flow conditions, depending on management conditions.

AB 1 Linear elongation and dry-matter production of three Sphagnum species (S. capillifolium, S. magellanicum and S. fallax) were measured during three consecutive growing seasons at a nutrient-poor mire in the southern Alps of Italy. The growth data were subjected to path analysis, in which climatic parameters, distance to water table and photoperiod were employed as independent variables in the regressions.
   2 Individuals of all three species were also cultured in the laboratory under different combinations of photoperiod x photon flux density x night temperature. The resulting growth data were compared by two-way ANOVA.
   3 Long-day photoperiod promoted growth of all species. Induction of dormancy required both short-day photoperiod and low night temperature.
   4 Mean temperature had a positive effect on growth of both S. capillifolium and S. magellanicum. Growth of S. fallax, a species which is more prone to desiccation in dry periods, was more affected by water-table depth.
   5 The periodic pattern of dry-matter accumulation in Sphagnum is controlled partly by an as yet unknown internal rhythm based on photoperiod, and partly by external factors related to climate. However, the response of Sphagnum to environment differs between species and is reflected in the competitive equilibria between species that are adapted to different microhabitats. Hollow species are usually more productive than hummock species in wet periods but this ratio often reverses in dry periods.

AB Minerotrophic peatlands or fen mires are characterized by anaerobic conditions and subsequently by a delayed litter decomposition. Therefore, in spite of their relatively small global area proportion (approx. 3%), peatlands constitute important sinks for carbon and nitrogen compounds with approx. 30% of the world's terrestric reserves. Degraded by substantial drainage or cultivation peatlands with changing water tables convert from CIN sinks to C/N sources, because of strongly increased C and N mineralization processes. It was shown that such degraded peatlands release high rates of the radiatively active trace gas nitrous oxide. The groundwater table, mineral- N fertilization, and stage of degradation are major factors affecting the nitrous oxide release. To give reasons for measures reducing nitrous oxide emission from peatlands, further studies are needed focussing, on e.g., the influence of weather or vegetation or derivations to give evidence for large-scale areas, respectively.

AB The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is the largest peatland complex in North America. More than 75% of the HBL occurs in Ontario, where the provincial government mandates that ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration be considered in land-use planning. Accomplishing this task requires identifying carbon indicators and assessing their responses to changing ecosystem processes, such as succession, permafrost thaw, and evapotranspiration (ET). Therefore, we synthesized information on peat carbon indicators and ecosystem process from the literature. Findings indicate that the long-term carbon accumulation, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, peat depth, and peatland age were similar (p > 0.10) between dry and wet peatland features. Furthermore, CO2 sequestration displayed the highest variability and ponds were net CO2 emitters. Recent carbon accumulation, CH4 emission, and ET were highest (p < 0.01) in wet features, with CH4 emission displaying wide variation. Increased active layer thickness (105 +/- 92 cm per 100 years) in permafrost was the most variable ecosystem process analyzed in this study, while variation in permafrost loss (53 +/- 23% per 100 years) was similar to that of carbon accumulation and ET rates. Processes creating wet and pond conditions may increase landscape-scale CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, weakening peatland carbon sinks. Dry conditions may reduce CH4 emissions but potentially increase peatland susceptibility to fire. Knowledge of these changes should be useful for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessments for large landscapes. However, better understanding of variability in CO2 sequestration, CH4 emission, and permafrost dynamics is required to design such assessments for small landscapes.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) stored in permafrost terrain is a key component in the global carbon cycle, but its composition and lability are largely unknown. We characterize and assess the degree of decomposition of SOM at nine sites representing major land-cover and soil types (including peat deposits) in an area of discontinuous permafrost in the European Russian Arctic. We analyze the elemental and stable isotopic composition of bulk SOM, and the degree of humification and elemental composition of humic acids (HA). The degree of decomposition is low in the O-horizons of mineral soils and peat deposits. In the permafrost free non-peatland soils there is enrichment of C-13 and N-15, and decrease in bulk C/N ratios indicating more decomposed material with depth. Spectral characterization of HA indicates low humification in O-horizons and peat deposits, but increase in humification in the deeper soil horizons of non-peatland soils, and in mineral horizons underlying peat deposits. GIS based maps indicate that less decomposed OM characteristic of the O-horizon and permafrost peat deposits constitute the bulk of landscape SOM (>70% of landscape soil C). We conclude, however, that permafrost has not been the key environmental factor controlling the current degree of decomposition of SOM in this landscape due to relatively recent permafrost aggradation. In this century, active layer deepening will mainly affect SOM with a relatively high degree of decomposition in deeper mineral soil horizons. Additionally, thawing permafrost in peat plateaus may cause rapid remobilization of less decomposed SOM through thermokarst expansion.

AB Net methane (CH4) emission from lakes depends on two antagonistic processes: CH4 production (methanogenesis) and CH4 oxidation (methanotrophy). It is unclear how climate warming will affect the balance between these processes, particularly among lakes of different trophic status. Here we show that methanogenesis is more sensitive to temperature than methanotrophy, and that eutrophication magnifies this temperature sensitivity. Using laboratory incubations of water and sediment from ten tropical, temperate and subarctic lakes with contrasting trophic states, ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic, we explored the temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis and methanotrophy. We found that both processes presented a higher temperature sensitivity in tropical lakes, followed by temperate, and subarctic lakes; but more importantly, we found that eutrophication triggered a higher temperature sensitivity. A model fed by our empirical data revealed that increasing lake water temperature by 2 degrees C leads to a net increase in CH4 emissions by 101-183% in hypereutrophic lakes and 47-56% in oligotrophic lakes. We conclude that climate warming will tilt the CH4 balance towards higher lake emission and that this impact will be exacerbated by the eutrophication of the lakes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Reddish-brown colored snow, containing spherical brown particles, has been observed in several mires in Japan. In order to characterize this remarkable phenomenon, the microbial community and chemical species in snow were analyzed. A core sample of snow which had a colored region was investigated and it revealed vertical shifts in physicochemical characteristics and the microbial community structure. The abundance of particles peaked within the colored layer, and correlated with the amount of reducible Fe(III). The interstitial water of the colored layer was enriched with Fe(11), and characterized by reduced concentration of dissolved methane. The bacterial community in the colored region was characterized by higher relative abundance of iron-reducing bacteria and methanotrophs. Aggregates of the brown particles were found as precipitates in snow melt pools, and were subjected to cloning analyses targeting several different genes. The majority of bacterial 16S rRNA gene clones belonged to the class Beta proteo bacteria or the phylum Bacteroidetes. No snow algae were detected in the eukaryotic small subunit rRNA gene clone library. As a possible carbon source to sustain the community in the snow, involvements of carbon dioxide and methane were investigated by analyzing the genes involved in their assimilation. In the analyses of genes for ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, clones related to sulfur oxidizers were obtained. The analysis or particulate methane monooxygenase genes indicated dominance of Methylobacter species. These results emphasized the uniqueness of this phenomenon, and iron reducers of the genus Geobacter are suggested to be the key organisms that could be investigated in order to understand the mechanism of this phenomenon.

AB We investigated electron transfer processes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and their potential importance for anaerobic heterotrophic respiration in a northern peatland. Electron accepting and donating capacities (EAC, EDC) of DOM were quantified using dissolved H2S and ferric iron as reactants. Carbon turnover rates were obtained from porewater profiles (CO2, CH4) and inverse modeling. Carbon dioxide was released at rates of 0.2-5.9 mmol m(-2) day(-1) below the water table. Methane (CH4) formation contributed < 10%, and oxygen consumption 2% to 40%, leaving a major fraction of CO2 production unexplained. DOM oxidized H2S to thiosulfate and was reduced by dissolved ferric iron. Reduction with H2S increased the subsequently determined EDC compared to untreated controls, indicating a reversibility of the electron transfer. In situ redox capacities of DOM ranged from 0.2 to 6.1 mEq g(-1) C (EAC) and from 0.0 to 1.4 mEq g(-1) C (EDC), respectively. EAC generally decreased with depth and changed after a water table drawdown and rebound by 20 and -45 mEq m(-2), respectively. The change in EAC during the water table fluctuation was similar to CH4 formation rates. In peatlands, electron transfer of DOM may thus significantly contribute to the oxidation of reduced organic substrates by anaerobic heterotrophic respiration, or by maintaining the respiratory activity of sulfate reducers via provision of thiosulfate. Part of the anaerobic electron flow in peat soils is thus potentially diverted from methanogenesis, decreasing its contribution to the total carbon emitted to the atmosphere.

AB The eddy covariance method was used for continuous measurement of the seasonal courses of the following parameters of the carbon cycle in a sedge-grass marsh type of wetland ecosystem (49A degrees 01'29aEuro(3)N, 14A degrees 46'13aEuro(3)E, South Bohemia, Czech Republic, Central Europe): gross ecosystem production (GEP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and ecosystem respiration. During a 3-year series of measurements, we recorded marked fluctuations of the water table, which affected the overall water regime of the wetland studied. Between-year differences in the water regime strongly influenced the total annual carbon sequestration. The lowest annual GEP and NEP of 996 and 152 g m(-2) of carbon, respectively, were recorded in 2006, a year with two large floods, one in the spring, the other in the summer. By contrast, in the dry year of 2007, with no flood, the highest annual GEP and NEP were recorded: 1,328 and 274 g m(-2), respectively. Significant differences were found in the efficiency of solar energy use for GEP [gross radiation use efficiency, GRUE = GEP/PhAR (photosynthetically active radiation), i.e., amount of carbon gained per energy unit]. The highest GRUE was recorded immediately after the 2006 summer flood. In 2007, the GRUE decreased linearly with rising water table. A variable water regime thus markedly affects the processes of carbon accumulation and the efficiency of solar energy use for organic matter production in freshwater wetlands of the sedge-grass marsh type.

AB Phenol oxidase is associated with the carbon cycle and its presence in soil environments is important to the formation of humic substances. Little effort has been made to integrate the response of phenol oxidases with soil management. We investigated phenol oxidase activity on a Maury silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Paleudalfs) soil after 33 years of imposed tillage and N fertilization treatments. Particle size fractions were investigated independently to help identify the location of the enzyme. Phenol oxidase activity was 1.7 times greater (P < 0.01) in no-tillage (NT) compared with moldboard plow (MP) in the control treatment (0 kg N ha(-1)), consistent with the known effects of tillage. The phenol oxidase was located primarily in the silt fraction, followed by the clay and sand in the NT. In NT, N fertilization (336 kg N ha(-1)) had a marked negative effect on soil phenol oxidase activity, showing a 38% decrease (P < 0.01) despite the increase in soil organic carbon (SOC). In contrast, MP plots were relatively insensitive to applied N rate. Phenol oxidase activity was related negatively to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (r = -0.49, P < 0.1), SOC (r = -0.49, P < 0.1) and dissolved organic carbon (r = -0.51, P < 0.1) in NT. This research provides new information about the response of phenol oxidase enzymes to long-term N fertilization in NT and MP systems. These findings suggest that manipulating the application rates of fertilizer N in soils under NT will make it possible to impact phenol oxidase activity.

AB Even though large extents of boreal peatlands are still in a pristine condition, especially in North America, extensive areas have been affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances that change some of the systems from being sinks to sources of carbon dioxide and shift the methane production/consumption patterns through alterations of both above- and below-ground communities and functions. In order to fully assess the role of peatlands on global C balance, now and in the future, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of the relative contributions of various groups of microorganisms to organic matter transformations. Here, we review the drivers structuring fungal, bacterial and archaeal communities in natural peatlands and the response of these microbial communities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, including fire, drainage, nutrient deposition, peat mining and climate change. The microbial diversity in peatlands is characterized by organisms that have developed physiological and metabolic adaptations to cope with the constraining conditions found in these ecosystems, such as low oxygen availability, cold temperature, acidity and oligotrophy. Furthermore, these unique organisms sometimes appear to be organized as repeat mosaics responding to vegetation, physicochemical and hydrological characteristics more than to geographical distance, in other words, similar to the much valued biodiversity aspects of the peatland vegetation itself and associated higher organisms. The response of microbial communities to disturbances is far from fully understood. In particular, whilst many studies have identified changes in microbial community composition or on microbially driven processes following a given disturbance, it remains unclear how the two components, diversity and function, relate with each other. Future challenges involve designing studies that will test whether ecological theories like species sorting, stress physiology, temporal niche or functional redundancy can be used to understand what regulates microbial populations and activity in peatlands, and studies that will allow us to predict more accurately how peatlands respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Permafrost thaw in the Arctic is mobilizing old carbon (C) from soils to aquatic ecosystems and the atmosphere. Little is known, however, about the assimilation of old C by aquatic food webs in Arctic watersheds. Here, we used C isotopes (delta C-13, Delta C-14) to quantify C assimilation by biota across 12 streams in arctic Alaska. Streams spanned watersheds with varying permafrost hydrology, from ice-poor bedrock to ice-rich loess (that is, yedoma). We measured isotopic content of (1) C sources including dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved inorganic C (DIC), and soil C, and (2) stream biota, including benthic biofilm and macroinvertebrates, and resident fish species (Arctic Grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma)). Findings document the assimilation of old C by stream biota, with depleted Delta C-14 values observed at multiple trophic levels, including benthic biofilm (C-14 ages = 5255 to 265 years before present (y BP)), macroinvertebrates (4490 y BP to modern), and fish (3195 y BP to modern). Mixing model results indicate that DOC and DIC contribute to benthic biofilm composition, with relative contributions differing across streams draining ice-poor and ice-rich terrain. DOC originates primarily from old terrestrial C sources, including deep peat horizons (39-47%; 530 y BP) and near-surface permafrost (12-19%; 5490 y BP). DOC also accounts for approximately half of fish isotopic composition. Analyses suggest that as the contribution of old C to fish increases, fish growth and nutritional status decline. We anticipate increases in old DOC delivery to streams under projected warming, which may further alter food web function in Arctic watersheds.

AB Methanotrophs are crucial in regulating methane emission from rice field systems. Type II methanotrophs in particular are often observed in high abundance in paddy soil. Some cultivated species of Methylocystis are able to grow on acetate in the absence of methane. We hypothesize that the dominant type II methanotrophs in paddy soil might facultatively utilize acetate for growth, which we evaluate in the present study. The measurement of methane oxidation rates showed that the methanotrophic activity in paddy soil was inhibited by the addition of acetate compared to the continuous supplementation of methane, but the paddy soil maintained the methane oxidation capacity and recovered following methane supplementation. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP) combined with cloning and sequencing of pmoA genes showed that Methylocystis was enriched after incubation with added acetate, while the type I methanotrophs Methylocaldum/Methylococcus and Methylobacter were enriched by methane supplementation. A comparison of pmoA sequences obtained in this study with those in the public database indicated that they were globally widespread in paddy soils or in associated with rice roots. Furthermore, we performed stable isotope probing (SIP) of pmoA messenger RNA (mRNA) to investigate the assimilation of C-13-acetate by paddy soil methanotrophs. RNA-SIP revealed that Methylocystis-related methanotrophs which shared the same genotype of the above enriched species were significantly labelled. It indicates that these methanotrophs actively assimilated the labelled acetate in paddy soil. Altogether, these results suggested that uncultivated Methylocystis species are facultative methanotrophs utilizing acetate as a secondary carbon source in paddy soil.

AB The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess the effect of organic matter self-assembly on its resistance to microbial mineralization. Humic acids isolated from leonardite, two peats and a mineral soil were used as organic matter samples because they provide a broad range of variability in terms of origin and the nature of their organic components. Using a benzene-methanol extraction the original humic acid samples were disassembled into humic components and a humic-lipid composite. The composite was further disassembled by using an alkaline aqueous extraction into humic amphiphilic and lipid components. Mixtures that reproduced the composition of self-assembled samples were prepared by mixing the solid individual fractions in the exact proportions that they were present in the original material. The original humic acid and their corresponding mixtures were added as the sole carbon source in separate aerobic cultures containing a microbial consortium isolated from a mineral soil. After incubation for 125 days mineralization of the self-assembled samples was shown to be higher by as much as 70% compared to their corresponding physical mixtures. The extent of mineralization of the self-assembled samples was not correlated to chemical composition base on the carbon-type distribution or hydrophobicity index derived from C-13 solid-state NMR spectra. Mineralization of the physical mixtures and fractions did vary with chemical composition and was accompanied by preferential mineralization of alkyl carbon. These results suggest the microbial mineralization of humic acids is related to their self-assembly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In aquatic systems, the presence of colored dissolved organic matter (DOM) may affect algal growth in numerous ways. This paper focuses on the effects of DOM on resource availability. DOM contains nitrogen and phosphorus, which may become available following microbial or photochemical degradation. Also, addition of DOM may stimulate bacterial growth, which in turn may change the availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, and inorganic carbon to algae. Experiments conducted in a moderately colored lake showed that the effect of DOM on algal growth depended on the amount of nutrients present in the peat extract and on bacterial response to DOM. There was evidence for competition for phosphorus between algae and bacteria in some treatments. In addition, when both bacteria growth and algal growth were high, bacterial respiration of DOM alleviated algal carbon limitation by providing algae with an inorganic carbon source. Thus, the degree to which bacteria are stimulated by the addition of DOM will affect the amount of phosphorus and inorganic carbon available for algal growth. These results suggest that part of the difficulty in predicting algal response to changes in DOM and nutrient concentration may be due partially to variability in bacterial responses.

AB Peatlands are permanently flooded wetland ecosystems that accumulate organic matter, which is what makes them carbon sinks and resevoirs. Peatlands that are located in paramos help to maintain water balance in surrounding ecosystems and regulate the distribution of the water used by human communities. Currently, peatlands are affected by climate change, which disrupts the balance between plant production and decomposition. Peatlands dominated by Distichia muscoides are particularly important since they depend on glacial hydrology. This paper presents a climatic reconstruction over the last 200 years, based on the vegetation succession history recorded in core samples from two peatlands located in the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy. The reconstructed vegetation was compared with historical records of temperature and precipitation. Our results showed differences in the trajectories followed by the vegetation, with an increase in plant production and dominance of D. muscoides over the last two decades related to increases in temperature. The positive water balance generated by the global increase in temperature and glacial melting results in an abundance of vascular plants in the turbera. The effect of the El Nino event of 1998 is reflected in a major change in the trajectories of the vegetation at the two sites, with Sphagnum peat being replaced by peat formed from different mosses, limiting the ability of the peatland to store organic matter. The effects of climate change are multiplied by phenomena such as El Nino that can rapidly alter the evolution of an ecosystem, even one as highly resilient as peatlands.

AB A physical and mathematical model of heat and moisture exchange and carbon dioxide balance in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system, based on the description of physical and biological processes proceeding in these media, is presented. The results of experimental investigations of the CO2 and water-vapor fluxes, as well as the accompanying meteorological parameters of the atmosphere, are used to calibrate the mathematical model. These parameters are obtained by a set of pulsation measurements during three vegetation periods in 1998-2000 at a highmoor bog located in the territory of the Central-Forest State Nature Biospheric Reserve in the Tver oblast (56 degrees N, 33 degrees E). Comparisons of the calculated and experimental results indicate that the presented mathematical model describes the processes of vertical transfer of heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide at the bog massif with a high degree of adequacy. The temporal variability of components of the CO2 and H2O balance at the highmoor bog is mainly associated with the variability of meteorological parameters of the atmosphere. This conclusion is related to short time intervals (day, week, month). The dynamics of biological characteristics of vegetation must be accounted for in calculations for longer periods.

AB Aims Fine root production is a major carbon flux in many peatland ecosystems and least understood because of methodological difficulties. We aimed to develop a robust method for inventorying fine root production in peatlands.
   Methods The ingrowth core method was modified to reduce disturbance and facilitate faster colonization by developing a novel type of corer-installer that reduces cutting of roots during installation, and using smaller volume of initially root-free substrate. The number of cores needed for a reliable site-level mean was estimated based on the variation observed in the test sites. Infrared calibration models were constructed for estimating the mass proportion of roots in the ingrowth cores without manual separation.
   Results We observed first-year production of 118, 216, 170 and 125 g m(-2) yr(-1) in the 0-50 cm soil layer for boreal drained bog forest, drained fen forest, wet sedge fen and dry sedge fen, respectively. Between 10 to 30 cores per site was estimated to be enough for obtaining reliable mean estimates of production. The infrared calibration models yielded high coefficient of determination (0.72-0.83) and low standard error of prediction (5-8 %).
   Conclusions We suggest that the methodology presented here saves time and manual labour and may be applied with a high number of replicates for inventorying fine root production in peatlands. Practical guidelines are presented.

AB To understand the ecological roles of epiphytic bryophytes in the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles of a tropical montane forest, we used samples in enclosures to estimate rates of growth, net production, and N accumulation by shoots in the canopy, and litterbags, to estimate rates of decomposition and N dynamics of epiphytic bryophyte litter in the canopy and on the forest floor in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Growth of epiphytic bryophytes was estimated at 30.0-49.9 percent/yr, net production at 122-203 g/m(2)/yr, and N accumulation at 1.8-3.0 g N/m(2)/yr. Cumulative mass loss from litterbags after one and two years in the canopy was 17 +/- 2 and 19 +/- 2 percent (mean +/- 1 SE) of initial sample mass, respectively, and mass loss from litter and green shoots in litterbags after one year on the forest floor was 29 +/- 2 and 45 +/- 3 percent, respectively Approximately 30 percent of the initial N mass was released rapidly from litter in both locations. Nitrogen loss from green shoots on the forest floor was greater; about 47 percent of the initial N mass was lost within the first three months. There was no evidence for net N immobilization by litter or green shoots, bur. the remaining N in litter was apparently recalcitrant. Annual net accumulation of C and N by epiphytic bryophytes was estimated at 37-64 g C/m(2)/yr and 0.8-1.3 g N/m(2)/yr, respectively. Previous research at this site indicated that epiphytic bryophytes retain inorganic N from atmospheric deposition to the canopy. Therefore, they play a major role in transforming N from mobile to highly recalcitrant forms in this ecosystem.

AB [1] Peatlands are sinks for carbon dioxide (CO2) because net primary production exceeds decomposition. The contribution of non-growing-season fluxes to the annual C budget of a peatland is, to date, little studied. We therefore measured the changes in the pattern of carbon exchange with seasons in a bog located in the cool temperate climate region. The growing season CO2-C uptake was of -113 g m(-2). During the non-growing season, 36 g C m(-2) was lost to the atmosphere, resulting in an estimated net ecosystem production of -76 g C m(-2). Despite the non-growing-season loss equaling 33 to 40% of the summer uptake, the net annual accumulation of was 3 times the long-term average net accumulation rate usually cited in the literature. The high rate of non-growing-season efflux could be supported directly by temporal concurrent respiration and the release of stored CO2 from prior production. These results indicate the need to revise current models to address peat thermal properties inducing CO2 production at lower temperature ranges.

AB This study examines a natural, rapid, fivefold increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in a temperate shallow lake, describing the processes by which increased DOC resulted in anoxic conditions and altered existing carbon cycling pathways. High precipitation for two consecutive years led to rising water levels and the flooding of adjacent degraded peatlands. Leaching from the flooded soils provided an initial increase in DOC concentrations (from a 2010 mean of 12 +/- 1 mg L-1 to a maximum concentration of 53 mg L-1 by June 2012). Increasing water levels, DOC, and phytoplankton concentrations reduced light reaching the sediment surface, eliminating most benthic primary production and promoting anoxia in the hypolimnion. From January to June 2012 there was a sudden increase in total phosphorus (from 57 mg L-1 to 216 mg L-1), DOC (from 24.6 mg L-1 to 53 mg L-1), and iron (from 0.12 mg L-1 to 1.07 mg L-1) concentrations, without any further large fluxes in water levels. We suggest that anoxic conditions at the sediment surface and flooded soils produced a dramatic release of these chemicals that exacerbated brownification and eutrophication, creating anoxic conditions that persisted roughly 6 months below a water depth of 1 m and extended periodically to the water surface. This brownification-anoxia feedback loop resulted in a near-complete loss of macroinvertebrate and fish populations, and increased surface carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by an order of magnitude relative to previous years.

AB A major challenge in peatland carbon cycle modeling is the estimation of subsurface methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production and consumption rates and pathways. The most common methods for modeling these processes are soil incubations and stable isotope modeling, both of which may involve departures from field conditions. To explore the impacts of these departures, we measured CH4/CO2 concentration ratios and C-13 fractionation factors (alpha(C), indicating CH4 production pathways) in field pore water from a thawing subarctic peatland, and compared these values to those observed in incubations of corresponding peat samples. Incubation CH4/CO2 production ratios were significantly and positively correlated with observed field CH4/CO2 concentration ratios, though observed field ratios were similar to 20 % of those in incubations due to CH4's lower solubility in pore water. After correcting the field ratios for CH4 loss with an isotope mass balance model, the incubation CH4/CO2 ratios and alpha(C) were both significantly positively correlated with field ratios and alpha(C) (respectively), both with slopes indistinguishable from 1. Although CH4/CO2 ratios and alpha(C) were slightly higher in the incubations, these shifts were consistent along the thaw progression, indicating that ex situ incubations can replicate trends in in situ CH4 production.

AB Understanding the controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange within saline boreal fens, appropriate natural analogs for landscape reclamation in areas affected by salinization in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, can provide insights into the biogeochemical and carbon sink functioning of constructed wetlands under saline conditions. Hence, this study aims to assess net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R), and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) of peatland and open-water areas within a saline boreal fen near Fort McMurray (Alberta, Canada) to determine environmental controls on CO(2)fluxes using community-scale CO(2)measurements along a salinity gradient. Strong positive correlations between NEE, GEP, leaf area index within peatland, and between GEP and vegetation density within open-water areas (ponds) were observed, demonstrating the importance of vegetation properties for carbon uptake. Strong negative correlations were found between NEE, GEP, R and water table depth and electrical conductivity within peatland. In contrast, GEP and R were positively correlated with phosphate concentrations in ponds, and electrical conductivity had no effect on CO(2)fluxes within ponds. In peatlands, links between CO(2)exchange and environmental factors were influenced by microtopography, and complex relationships between NEE, GEP, R and environmental variables were observed within depressions.

AB Stress factors such as climate change and drought may switch the role of temperate peatlands from carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks to sources, leading to positive feedback to global climate change. Water level management has been regarded as an important climate change mitigation strategy as it can sustain the natural net CO2 sink function of a peatland. Little is known about how resilient peatlands are in the face of future climate change scenarios, as well as how effectively water level management can sustain the CO2 sink function to mitigate global warming. The authors assess the effect of climate change on CO2 exchange of south Swedish temperate peatlands, which were either unmanaged or subject to water level regulation. Climate chamber simulations were conducted using experimental peatland mesocosms exposed to current and future representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5). The results showed that all managed and unmanaged systems under future climate scenarios could serve as CO2 sinks throughout the experimental period. However, the 2018 extreme drought caused the unmanaged mesocosms under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 switch from a net CO2 sink to a source during summer. Surprisingly, the unmanaged mesocosms under RCP 2.6 benefited from the warmer climate, and served as the best sink among the other unmanaged systems. Water level management had the greatest effect on the CO2 sink function under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, which improved their CO2 sink capability up to six and two times, respectively. Under the current climate scenario, water level management had a negative effect on the CO2 sink function, and it had almost no effect under RCP 2.6. Therefore, the researchers conclude that water level management is necessary for RCP 8.5, beneficial for RCP 4.5 and unimportant for RCP 2.6 and the current climate.

AB Microtopography, or the small-scale variation in ground surface height (10(-1)-10(0) m) over short (10(0)-10(2) m) spatial scales, is a ubiquitous feature of wetlands globally. This variation in elevation, characterized by local high ("hummocks") and low ("hollows") patches, is more structured than what is observed in uplands, and is intertwined with concordantly structured spatiotemporal variability in hydrologic regimes and associated ecological processes. The importance of microtopography in wetlands is manifold, with critical influence on local hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological processes. Further, the creation and maintenance of wetland microtopography is a balance between activation processes (i.e., those that induce random elevation variation) and autogenic reinforcement processes (i.e., those that provide the feedbacks necessary for the persistence of microtopography). While there are many mechanisms that create vertical structure (e.g., tree falls, accumulation of roots and soil organic matter, and sediment deposition), they all yield a similar core feedback to enhance and sustain microtopographic structure. Finally, microtopography contributes to spatial patterning that confers emergent ecosystem-scale functions such as hydrologic storage and flows, carbon cycling, organism dispersal, and biodiversity. There is an ongoing need to study the origins and implications of this fine-scale variation in elevation, as well as the utility of including microtopography in model predictions and ecological restoration efforts.

AB The influences of three fulvic acids, referred to as SAFA (purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Reagent Company), SRFA (Suwannee River Fulvic Acid from International Humic Substances Society (IHSS)) and PPFA (Pahokee Peat Fulvic Acid from IHSS), with different chemical composition, structure, hydrophobicity and aromaticity degree on biological wastewater denitrification were investigated. It was found that SAFA remarkably enhanced the denitrification performance, while SRFA and PPFA had no obvious effect. Mechanistic study revealed that SAFA remarkably improved the metabolism of a carbon source (glucose) by stimulating the activities of key enzymes (hexokinase, 6-phosphofructose kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and pyruvate kinase) involved in glycolysis. The increase of glucose utilization resulted in the increase of intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio that favored microbial denitrification. Meanwhile the bacterial growth was significantly improved in the presence of SAFA. Further studies revealed that SAFA also increased the activities of key denitrifying enzymes, including nitrate reductase (NAR), nitrite reductase (NIR), nitric oxide reductase (NOR), and nitrous oxide reductase (N2OR), thus enhancing the reduction of nitrate and transformation of its intermediates, especially nitrite and nitrous oxide. All the above positive effects posed by SAFA might be attributed to its lower molecular weight, less complex aromatic structures with predominantly aliphatic carbons and higher hydrophilicity than SRFA and PPFA, which lead to a more active interaction with denitrifying microorganisms via metabolism process regulation. A better knowledge of the relationship between molecular structure of fulvic acids and microbial denitrification activity may be of practical interest in the nitrogen cycle in nature's niches.

AB Some methods for the isolation of refractory natural organic substances are discussed.  The ad-/desorption on polystyrene-resins (XAD-2), ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis were tested.  For the experiments different types of water were used (bog lake water, lake and river water, scepage water from landfill leachates and soil extracts) and various practical procedures and membranes were applied.  The valuation was done by mass balancing of the organic carbon and of some selected anions and cations.  The XAD method leads to three different DOC fractions (fulvic- and humic acids and non-humic substances).  Generally only one main fraction is obtained by the membrane techniques.  The fractions are characterized by spectroscopical methods and by gel-chromatography.

TI Greenhouse gas exchange of rewetted bog peat extraction sites and a
   Sphagnum cultivation site in northwest Germany

AB During the last decades an increasing area of drained peatlands has been rewetted. Especially in Germany, rewetting is the principal treatment on cutover sites when peat extraction is finished. The objectives are bog restoration and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The first sites were rewetted in the 1980s. Thus, there is a good opportunity to study long-term effects of rewetting on greenhouse gas exchange, which has not been done so far on temperate cutover peatlands. Moreover, Sphagnum cultivating may become a new way to use cutover peatlands and agriculturally used peatlands as it permits the economical use of bogs under wet conditions. The climate impact of such measures has not been studied yet.
   We conducted a field study on the exchange of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide at three rewetted sites with a gradient from dry to wet conditions and at a Sphagnum cultivation site in NW Germany over the course of more than 2 years. Gas fluxes were measured using transparent and opaque closed chambers. The ecosystem respiration (CO2) and the net ecosystem exchange (CO2) were modelled at a high temporal resolution. Measured and modelled values fit very well together. Annually cumulated gas flux rates, net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) and global warming potential (GWP) balances were determined. The annual net ecosystem exchange (CO2) varied strongly at the rewetted sites (from -201.7 +/- 126.8 to 29.7 +/- 112.7 gCO(2)-C m(-2) a(-1)) due to differing weather conditions, water levels and vegetation. The Sphagnum cultivation site was a sink of CO2 (-118.8 +/- 48.1 and -78.6 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2) a(-1)). The annual CH4 balances ranged between 16.2 +/- 2.2 and 24.2 +/- 5.0 gCH(4)-C-2 a(-1) at two inundated sites, while one rewetted site with a comparatively low water level and the Sphagnum farming site show CH4 fluxes close to 0. The net N2O fluxes were low and not significantly different between the four sites.
   The annual NECB was between -185.5 +/- 126.9 and 49.9 +/- 112.8 gCO(2)-Cm(-2)a(-1) at the rewetted sites and -115.8 +/- 48.1 and -77 +/- 39.8 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1) at the Sphagnum cultivating site. The annual GWP100 balances ranged from -280.5 +/- 465.2 to 644.5 +/- 413.6 gCO(2)-eq.m(-2) a(-1) at the rewetted sites. In contrast, the Sphagnum farming site had a cooling impact on the climate in both years (-356.8 +/- 176.5 and -234.9 +/- 145.9 gCO(2)Cm(-2)a(-1)). If the carbon exported through the harvest of the Sphagnum biomass and the additional CO2 emission from the decay of the organic material is considered, the NECB and GWP100 balances are near neutral.
   Peat mining sites are likely to become net carbon sinks and a peat accumulating ("growing") peatland within 30 years of rewetting, but the GWP100 balance may still be positive. A recommended measure for rewetting is to achieve a water level of a few centimetres below ground.
   Sphagnum farming is a climate-friendly alternative to conventional commercial use of bogs. A year-round constant water level of a few centimetres below ground level should be maintained.

AB Long-term increased nutrient influx into normally nutrient-limited peatlands in combination with altered hydrological conditions may threaten a peatland's carbon storage function and affect its greenhouse gas (GHG) budget. However, in situ studies on the effects of long-term altered conditions on peatland functioning and GHG budgets are scarce. We thus quantified GHG fluxes in a peatland exposed to enhanced water level fluctuations and long-term nutrient infiltration in Ontario, Canada, via eddy-covariance and flux chamber measurements. The peatland was a prominent sink of - 680 +/- 202 g carbon dioxide (CO2) and a source of 22 +/- 8 g methane (CH4) m(-2) year(-1), resulting in a negative radiative forcing of - 80 g CO2 eq. m(-2) y(-1). During the growing season CH4 fluxes were constantly high (0.1 g m(-2) s(-1)). Further, on three dates, we measured nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and observed a small flux of 2.2 mg m(-2) day(-1) occurring during the thawing period. Taking the studied ecosystem as a model system for other peatlands exposed to long-term increased nutrient infiltration and enhanced water level fluctuations, our data suggest that such peatlands can maintain their carbon storage function and CO2 sequestration may outweigh emissions of CH4.

AB Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle due to the high carbon storage in the substrate. Ecosystem production depends, for example, on the solar energy amount that reaches the vegetation, however the diffuse component of this flux can substantially increase ecosystem net productivity. This phenomenon is observed in different ecosystems, but the study of the atmosphere optical properties on peatland production is lacking. In this paper, the presented methodology allowed us to disentangle the diffuse radiation impact on the net ecosystem production (NEP) of Rzecin peatland, Poland. It allowed us to assess the impact of the atmospheric scattering process determined by the aerosol presence in the air mass. An application of atmospheric radiation transfer (ART) and ecosystem production (EP) models showed that the increase of aerosol optical thickness from 0.09 to 0.17 caused NEP to rise by 3.4-5.7%. An increase of the diffusion index (DI) by 0.1 resulted in an NEP increase of 6.1-42.3%, while a DI decrease of 0.1 determined an NEP reduction of -49.0 to -10.5%. These results show that low peatland vegetation responds to changes in light scattering. This phenomenon should be taken into account when calculating the global CO2 uptake estimation of such ecosystems.

AB The decomposition of deep peat deposits controls the long-term carbon balance of peatlands but is poorly understood with respect to rates and controls. To rectify this deficiency, we estimated in situ dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and methane (CH4) production rates from a beaver pond to a central bog dome and related them to organic matter properties, Gibbs free energies of respiration, and delta C-13 values of DIC and CH4. DIC and CH4 production decreased from maxima of similar to 10 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) near the water table to values <0.1 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) at depths > 1 m, and there was little differentiation among sites. Deeper into the peat, we measured an accumulation of DIC, CH4, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) enriched in aromatic and phenolic moieties, which resulted from the slowness of diffusive vertical pore-water movement. Lack of transport may have slowed decomposition in two ways: (1) Aromatic and phenolic DOM moieties accumulated, while the release of carbohydrate-rich DOM from peat was apparently impeded. (2) The accumulation of DIC and CH4 reduced Gibbs free energy of acetoclastic methanogenesis toward a critical threshold value of -25 to -20 kJ mol(-1) CH4. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was energetically more favorable and generally dominated according to an isotopic fractionation between CO2 and CH4 of 1.053 to 1.076, but it was apparently impeded by some other factor. We conclude that lateral homogeneity and slowness of decomposition in geologically sealed deep peat deposits are assisted by a lack of solute transport, which facilitates the formation of deep peat deposits over millennia.

AB Continuous eddy-covariance measurements of turbulent methane exchange between the ground and the atmosphere were carried out during the period from July 2013 to September 2015. The measurement sites were located in areas characterized by different types of use: the city (Lodz, central Poland) and the wetlands of Biebrza National Park (northeastern Poland). Regardless of the type of surface, such long-term, continuous measurements of the turbulent fluxes of methane are rare. Our aim was to investigate the temporal variability of the turbulent methane exchange in the surface-atmosphere system, while considering the impact of land use. Because cities are a huge source of atmospheric carbon dioxide, we compared the intensity of methane emissions from the city as compared to the wetland, which is considered to be the most intense natural source atmospheric methane. In both cases, the results show a clear prevalence of positive as compared with negative fluxes. This shows that both areas are net sources of methane to the troposphere. The measurements also demonstrated the existence of a clear annual cycle of turbulent methane flux in the centre of the city (average values in winter ranged from similar to 40 to 60 nmol m(-2).s(-1) and were significantly greater than values measured, in summer) as well as in the wetlands, where maximum values were observed during the warm part of the year (approximately 80 nmol m(-2).s(-1) or more). The different times of maximum CH4 flux (FCH4) occurrence resulted from the differentiation of processes that determine methane emissions: in the city these are anthropogenic emissions (strongest in winter); in the wetland, natural processes dominate. The diurnal variability of FCH4 was faintly detectable, except for the cold half of the year in the city and the warm half of the year in the wetland. The studied area of the centre of Lodz, in turn, is also characterized by a weekly cycle of methane exchange: the values measured on working days were higher by 6.6% (winter) to 5.6% (summer) than those observed on weekends. Differences in the annual exchange of methane in 2014 were insignificant: the centre of Lodz emitted 17.4 g m(-2) net, while the wetland emitted about 18.7 g m(-2) net. The results of the measurements performed during the period from January to September 2015, however, suggest that a very dry summer, drying of the soil and, consequently, a reduced water level in the fen significantly reduced the ability of the wetland to emit methane. This pattern was not observed in the city. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Peatlands and the carbon cycle: from local processes to global

AB Peatlands cover only 3% of the Earth's land surface but boreal and subarctic peatlands store about 15-30% of the world's soil carbon ( C) as peat. Despite their potential for large positive feedbacks to the climate system through sequestration and emission of greenhouse gases, peatlands are not explicitly included in global climate models and therefore in predictions of future climate change. In April 2007 a symposium was held in Wageningen, the Netherlands, to advance our understanding of peatland C cycling. This paper synthesizes the main findings of the symposium, focusing on (i) small-scale processes, (ii) C fluxes at the landscape scale, and (iii) peatlands in the context of climate change.
   The main drivers controlling most are related to some aspects of hydrology. Despite high spatial and annual variability in Net Ecosystem Exchange ( NEE), the differences in cumulative annual NEE are more a function of broad scale geographic location and physical setting than internal factors, suggesting the existence of strong feedbacks. In contrast, trace gas emissions seem mainly controlled by local factors.
   Key uncertainties remain concerning the existence of perturbation thresholds, the relative strengths of the CO2 and CH4 feedback, the links among peatland surface climate, hydrology, ecosystem structure and function, and trace gas biogeochemistry as well as the similarity of process rates across peatland types and climatic zones. Progress on these research areas can only be realized by stronger co-operation between disciplines that address different spatial and temporal scales.

AB The mid-Holocene eruption of Aniakchak volcano (Aniakchak II) in southwest Alaska was among the largest eruptions globally in the last 10,000 years (VEI-6). Despite evidence for possible impacts on global climate, the precise age of the eruption is not well-constrained and little is known about regional environmental impacts. A closely spaced sequence of radiocarbon dates at a peatland site over 1000 km from the volcano show that peat accumulation was greatly reduced with a hiatus of approximately 90-120 yr following tephra deposition. During this inferred hiatus no paleoenvironmental data are available but once vegetation returned the flora changed from a Cyperaceae-dominated assemblage to a Poaceae-dominated vegetation cover, suggesting a drier and/or more nutrient-rich ecosystem. Oribatid mites are extremely abundant in the peat at the depth of the ash, and show a longer-term, increasingly wet peat surface across the tephra layer. The radiocarbon sample immediately below the tephra gave a date of 1636-1446 cal yr BC suggesting that the eruption might be younger than previously thought Our findings suggest that the eruption may have led to a widespread reduction in peatland carbon sequestration and that the impacts on ecosystem functioning were profound and long-lasting.

AB Methanogens are of great importance in carbon cycling and alternative energy production, but quantitation with culture-based methods is time-consuming and biased against methanogen groups that are difficult to cultivate in a laboratory. For these reasons, methanogens are typically studied through culture-independent molecular techniques. We developed a SYBR green I quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to quantify total numbers of methyl coenzyme M reductase alpha-subunit (mcrA) genes. TaqMan probes were also designed to target nine different phylogenetic groups of methanogens in qPCR assays. Total mcrA and mcrA levels of different methanogen phylogenetic groups were determined from six samples: four samples from anaerobic digesters used to treat either primarily cow or pig manure and two aliquots from an acidic peat sample stored at 4 degrees C or 20 degrees C. Only members of the Methanosaetaceae, Methanosarcina, Methanobacteriaceae, and Methanocorpusculaceae and Fen cluster were detected in the environmental samples. The three samples obtained from cow manure digesters were dominated by members of the genus Methanosarcina, whereas the sample from the pig manure digester contained detectable levels of only members of the Methanobacteriaceae. The acidic peat samples were dominated by both Methanosarcina spp. and members of the Fen cluster. In two of the manure digester samples only one methanogen group was detected, but in both of the acidic peat samples and two of the manure digester samples, multiple methanogen groups were detected. The TaqMan qPCR assays were successfully able to determine the environmental abundance of different phylogenetic groups of methanogens, including several groups with few or no cultivated members.

AB Methanogenesis and methane oxidation, fundamental microbial processes in the global carbon cycle, are mediated by numerous factors in terrestrial soil and wetland ecosystems. Accurate quantification of CH4 and CO2 concentrations in soils and wetlands is now possible using membrane inlet mass spectrometry. Below-ground production and headspace exchange of O-2, CO2 and CH4 were monitored in microcosms from an upland Soil (Scotland) and three different peat bog systems (Sweden, Iceland and Scotland) by membrane inlet mass spectrometry. A comparison of cores from the different locations revealed that temperature, soil structure, plant cover and water table level are associated with the regulation of the depth of oxygen available for methanotrophic processes in the oxic zone and therefore gas emission rates. In aerobic soil cores, all the methane produced in anaerobic sites is oxidised rather than being emitted from the soil surface. In peat cores, molar CH4:CO2 ratios of around 1:10 indicate the boundary between the oxic and the anoxic zones. Changes in dissolved gas concentrations with depth and especially the molar CH4:CO2-ratios are discussed. We also demonstrate that inconsistencies in dissolved gas profiles, along with higher localized molar CH4:CO2-ratios, indicate bubble formation at depths greater than 10 cm; gas emission by ebullition was promoted at these sites. Increase in temperature had a particularly strong effect upon gas dynamics in soil and peat cores. Gas solubilities were reduced and elevated CO2 and CH4 emission rates were observed potentially due to increased microbial activity.

AB We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine how the decomposition of particulate belowground organic matter from a salt marsh is enhanced, or not, by different mixtures of crude oil, nitrogen (N), or phosphorus (P) acting individually or synergistically. The experiment was conducted in 3.8 L sampling chambers producing varying quantities of gas whose volume was used as a surrogate measure of organic decomposition under anaerobic conditions. Gas production after 28 days, from highest to lowest, was +NP = +N >>> +P, or +oil. The gas production under either +P or +oil conditions was indistinguishable from gas production in the control chamber. Nitrogen, not phosphorus, or +NP, was the dominant factor controlling organic decomposition rates in these experiments. The implication for organic salt marsh soils is that shoreline erosion is enhanced by salt marsh oiling, presumably by its toxicity, but not by its effect on the decomposition rates of plant biomass belowground. Nutrient additions, on the other hand, may compromise the soil strength, creating a stronger disparity in soil strength between upper and lower soil layers leading to marsh loss. Nutrient amendments intended to decrease oil concentration in the marsh may not have the desired effect, and are likely to decrease soil strength, thereby enhancing marsh-to-water conversions in organic salt marsh soils.

AB High arctic wetlands hold large stores of soil carbon (C). The fate of these C stores in a changing climate is uncertain, as rising air temperatures may differentially affect photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration (ER). In this study, open-top warming chambers were used to increase air and soil temperatures in contrasting microtopographic positions of a high arctic fen in NW Greenland. CO2 exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere was measured on 28 dates over a 3-year period. Measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index, leaf and stem growth, leaf-level gas exchange, leaf nitrogen, leaf delta C-13, and fine root production were made to investigate the mechanisms and consequences of observed changes in CO2 exchange. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) increased with chamber warming in hollows, which are characterized by standing water, and in hummocks, which extend above the water table. ER, however, increased only in hummocks, such that net ecosystem exchange (NEE) increased in hollows, but did not change in hummocks with chamber warming. Complementary measurements of plant growth revealed that increases in GEP corresponded with increases in C allocation to aboveground biomass in hummocks and belowground biomass in hollows. Our results and those of several recent studies clearly demonstrate that effects of climate change on the C balance of northern wetlands will depend upon microtopography which, in turn, may be sensitive to climate change.

AB Peatlands are important ecosystems for biodiversity conservation, global carbon cycling and water storage. Hydrological changes due to climate variability have accelerated the degradation of global and regional ecosystem services of peatlands. Diatoms are important producers and bioindicators in wetlands, but comprehensive diatom-based inference models for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction in peatlands are scarce. To explore the use of diatoms for investigating peatland hydrological change, this study established a training set consisting of diatom composition and twelve environmental factors from 105 surface samples collected from five Sphagnum peatlands in northeastern China. Diatom communities were dominated by Eunotia species. Ordination analyses showed that depth to the water table (DWT) was the most important factor influencing diatom distribution, independently accounting for 4.99% of total variance in diatom data. Accordingly, a diatom-based DWT transfer function was developed and thoroughly tested. The results revealed that the best-performing model was based on weighted averaging with inverse deshrinking (R-2 = 0.66, RMSEP = 8.8 cm with leave-one-out cross validation). Quantitative reconstruction of DWT on a short peat core collected from the Aershan Peatland (Inner Mongolia) recorded climate-mediated hydrological changes over the last two centuries. This study presents the first diatom-water table transfer function in Sphagnum peatlands, and highlights the potential of diatoms as a powerful tool to assess the magnitude of past hydrological changes in peatlands of northeastern China, as well as similar peaty environments worldwide.

AB Wetlands provide crucial habitats, are critical in the global carbon cycle, and act as key biogeochemical and hydrological buffers. The effectiveness of these services is mainly controlled by hydrological processes, which can be highly variable both spatially and temporally due to structural complexity and seasonality. Spatial analysis of 2-D geoelectrical monitoring data integrated into the interpretation of conventional hydrological data has been implemented to provide a detailed understanding of hydrological processes in a riparian wetland. A two-layered hydrological system was observed in the peat. In the lower part of the peat, upwelling of deeper groundwater from underlying deposits was considered the driver for a 30% increase in peat resistivity during Winter/Spring. In Spring/Summer there was a 60% decrease in resistivity in the near-surface peats due to plant transpiration and/or microbial activity. Water exchange between the layers only appeared to be initiated following large drops in the encircling surface water stage. For the first time, we demonstrated that automated interpretation of geoelectrical data can be used to quantify ground movement in the vertical direction. Here, we applied this method to quantify shrink-swell of expandable soils, affecting hydrological parameters, such as, porosity and permeability. This study shows that an integrated interpretation of hydrological and geophysical data can significantly improve the understanding of wetland hydrological processes. Potentially, this approach can provide the basis for the evaluation of ecosystem services and may aid in the optimization of wetland management strategies.

AB Temperature and substrate availability are among the key factors controlling microbial metabolism. The relative importance of these two drivers on soil organic matter turnover is, however, hotly debated. In this study, we investigated the effect of temperature changes on the potential enzyme activities involved in C (phenol-oxidase) and N (protease and amidase) cycling by incubating peat soils collected in winter and summer at the two typical temperatures recorded in the field during these two distinct periods (4 and 19 C, respectively). In addition, to evaluate the effect of substrate limitations, we also compared the respiration rates of the thermally adapted soils with and without plant litter additions. Results showed that both collection season and incubation temperature had a significant effect on the two enzymes involved in N-cycling, with summer and increasing temperatures having detrimental effects on the potential activities of protease and amidase, whereas none of these factors affected phenol-oxidase activity. Furthermore, while adding readily decomposable substrate accelerated decomposition rates, CO2 flux rates were similar for all temperature conditions. Interestingly, the greatest contribution of litter to CO2 emissions occurred in the summer samples incubated at the lower temperature, whereas for the winter samples the stimulating effect on soil respiration was observed under warmer conditions. These findings suggest that the responses of soil microbial communities to temperature and substrate availability seem to strongly depend on the long-term temperature conditions and its interaction with substrate availability.

AB Seepage of coal-bed methane (CBM) through soils is a potential source of atmospheric CH4 and also a likely source of ancient (i.e. 14C-dead) carbon to soil microbial communities. Natural abundance 13C and 14C compositions of bacterial membrane phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and soil gas CO2 and CH4 were used to assess the incorporation of CBM-derived carbon into methanotrophs and other members of the soil microbial community. Concentrations of type I and type II methanotroph PLFA biomarkers (16:18c and 18:18c, respectively) were elevated in CBM-impacted soils compared with a control site. Comparison of PLFA and 16s rDNA data suggested type I and II methanotroph populations were well estimated and overestimated by their PLFA biomarkers, respectively. The 13C values of PLFAs common in type I and II methanotrophs were as negative as 67 parts per thousand and consistent with the assimilation of CBM. PLFAs more indicative of nonmethanotrophic bacteria had 13C values that were intermediate indicating assimilation of both plant- and CBM-derived carbon. 14C values of select PLFAs (351 to 936 parts per thousand) indicated similar patterns of CBM assimilation by methanotrophs and nonmethanotrophs and were used to estimate that 3591% of carbon assimilated by nonmethanotrophs was derived from CBM depending on time of sampling and soil depth.

AB Peatlands are remarkable for their specific biodiversity, crucial role in carbon cycling and climate change. Their deposits preserve organism remains that can be used to reconstruct long-term ecosystem and environmental changes as well as human impact in the prehistorical and historical past. This study presents a new multi-proxy reconstruction of the peatland and vegetation development investigating climate dynamics and human impact at the border between mixed and boreal forests in the Valdai Uplands (the East European Plain, Russia) during most of the Holocene. We performed plant macrofossil, pollen, testate amoeba, Cladocera, diatom, peat humification, loss on ignition, carbon and nitrogen content, delta C-13 and delta N-15 analyses supported by radiocarbon dating of the peat deposits from the Krivetskiy Mokh mire. The results of the study indicate that the wetland ecosystem underwent a classic hydroserial succession from a lake (8300 BC-900 BC) terrestrialized through a fen (900 BC-630 AD) to an ombrotrophic bog (630 AD-until present) and responded to climate changes documented over the Holocene. Each stage was associated with clear changes in local diversity of organisms responding mostly to autogenic successional changes during the lake stage and to allogenic factors at the fen-bog stage. The latter can be related to increased human impact and greater sensitivity of peatland ecosystems to external, especially climatic, drivers as compared to lakes.

AB Understanding the climatic and biological factors that regulate soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux is crucial in peatlands because they contain a large proportion of terrestrial carbon (C). We predicted that rainfall reduction would increase soil CO2 efflux, and that cessation of below-ground allocation of recent plant assimilate would reduce soil CO2 efflux. These predictions were tested in the field using rainfall shelters that allowed a maximum of 40 % of rainfall onto 2 x 2 m plots by diverting rainwater from the shelter roofs with guttering, and by girdling stems of the dominant plant, Calluna vulgaris, for two years. We also used (CO2)-C-13-pulse labelling of intact monoliths at ambient CO2 concentrations to trace recent assimilate from plant shoots to roots, bulk soil, leachate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux in the sheltered plots increased in Year 1 but not in Year 2, and we found a positive relationship between soil CO2 efflux and water table depth. Our data indicate that lowering the water table below a critical threshold (15-20 cm) affects soil CO2 efflux. Girdling of C. vulgaris shoots resulted in no measurable reduction in soil CO2 efflux, while only similar to 3 % of C-13 fixed by shoots was recovered in soil CO2 efflux and DOC in the 20 days after labelling. Our findings show that below-ground allocation of recent assimilate from C. vulgaris plants > 6 years old has little impact on soil CO2 efflux.

AB Sphagnum bogs cover large continental areas and may play a major role as carbon sinks. They have also great biological, historical and palcoecological values. These features led to a large amount of research and publications, especially conceptual and numerical models in various scientific fields. Drawing on this literature, we propose an integrated conceptual model of bog functioning. The model is built on 8 basic assumptions acting at two scales: the ecosystem as a whole, the bog or mesotope and the microforms, the elementary systemic units. Five kinds of ecological constraints driving the ecosystem are defined too. Based on the assumptions, the constraints and bibliographical data, thresholds and positive and negative feedbacks are elucidated. The negative feedbacks controlling the development and homeostasis of the ecosystem are related to the balance between the vegetation which builds the peat body, the shape of the later and the water fluxes passing through it. The positive feedback allowing the establishment and the persistence of the ecosystem is related to peat moss engineering. Four positive feedback loops can stop the peat production, and lead to the destruction of the bog. Two loops are biological processes involving trees and blue moor grass (Molinia caerulea) which spread onto the bog. The two other loops are related to soil and shape disturbance and changes in production and degradation of the organic matter. The model is especially designed to help ecological monitoring and highlights the importance of an ecological diagnostic integrating plants, soil and water fluxes. Based on this model, action plans should focus on maintaining the negative feedbacks and the peat moss engineering while stopping the unfavourable other positive feedback loops.

TI A snapshot of CO2 and CH4 evolution in a thermokarst pond near Igarka,

AB Thermokarst wetlands and ponds in the subarctic, which are located in land surface depressions resulting from permafrost melt, are strong sources of CH4, but little is known about respiration processes supporting these emissions. We determined CH4 fluxes and concentration profiles of dissolved gases and anions and some delta C-13 ratios of CO2 and CH4 in a thermokarst pond and adjacent smaller thermokarst depressions in the forest tundra near Igarka, northern Siberia in August 2006. Methane was emitted at 110-170 mg m(-2) d(-1) and produced mostly by CO2 reduction, which also provided high Gibbs free energies on the order of 50-70 KJ mol(-1) H-2 due to high H-2 concentrations. The diffusive flux calculated from CH4 gradients in the floating mat contributed < 2% to emissions. CH4 was apparently not oxidized deeper than 20 cm into the floating mat and the water body below. Anaerobic respiration required to reproduce nonsteady state CO2 concentration maxima in the floating mat above the water body was 30-80 nmol cm(-3) d(-1) or 250 mg m(-2) d(-1) and thus on a similar order of magnitude as CH4 fluxes. The results suggest that floating mat-covered thermokarst ponds located in northern Siberian bogs effectively convert recently fixed carbon into CH4 and thus allow for emissions independently from the finite, bog-derived carbon source. The relative contribution of recently fixed and old bog-derived carbon to C fluxes requires further investigation, however.

ID SOIL MICROFLORA; ORGANIC-MATTER; DECOMPOSITION
AB The effect of mineral supply, pH, and drying-rewetting on the microbial respiration activity (RA) in peat samples from a raised bog was studied. Neutralization of the acidity of peat with phosphate buffer was found to stimulate respiration of microorganisms only for a period as short as 3 days. A significant decline in RA was observed upon addition of Ca(No-3)(2) or a mixture of (NH4)(2)SO4 and KH2PO4. Drying-rewetting of peat also caused RA to decline after a transient increase. To explain the effects observed, it is assumed that the community of heterotrophic microorganisms in the peat of raised bogs is subject to multiple limitation (by the sources of carbon and energy and other biogenic elements) and that the addition of deficient elements to peat brings about metabolic inhibition arising from disturbed pH balance.

AB The stratigraphy of four peat sequences collected in two peat bogs located in the Eastmain River watershed (52 degrees N, 76 degrees W), James Bay lowlands, Quebec, Canada, was investigated to reconstruct past hydroclimatic conditions of peat accumulation and associated carbon dynamics during the late Holocene. Analyses of macrofossils, testate amoebae, peat humification, C/N ratio and bulk density were performed at high-resolution along each peat core, allowing the potential of each proxy indicator under varying nutrient status and hydroclimatic conditions to be evaluated. Some synchronous changes were recorded both within and between peatlands, suggesting the influence of allogenic factors in the development of these peatlands. Other reconstructed changes have highlighted autogenic succession processes related to the local geomorphic and hydrologic context. Highest peat carbon accumulation rates (LORCA) were correlated with either wet conditions or high woody debris percentages, suggesting that residence time of the biomass in the acrotelm and the nature of plant material can both influence carbon accumulation rates in peat bogs. This study provides the first high-resolution paleoecohydrological reconstructions from the mid-boreal ecoregion of eastern Canada, a region in which peatlands occupy 30 to 60% of the land surface.

AB Extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) in soils play a pivotal role in ecosystem processes, such as organic carbon (C) decomposition or nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization. Thus, EEA measurements can provide insights into the rates of ecosystem-level processes in peatlands, which will experience more frequent extreme droughts in the future. In the present study, the activities of seven hydrolases and two oxidases involved in the acquisition of C, N, and P were measured in response to simulated extreme drought events during the summer. The combined results of three consecutive years showed that the beta-1,4-glucosidase and beta-1,4-xylosidase involved in mediating labile-C decomposition increased by 102.63% and 100.63%, respectively. In contrast, the oxidases involved in mediating recalcitrant-C decomposition showed a non-significant decreasing trend, indicating that extreme drought significantly increased the decomposition of cellulose in peatlands. The C-acquisition enzyme, C:P -acquisition enzyme, and N:P-acquisition enzyme activities increased, on average, by 78.45%, 51.57%, and 36.57%, respectively, under extreme drought, impacting the rates of microbial growth and organic matter depolymerization. In addition, the results showed that changes in the C-acquisition enzyme were correlated with shifts in the soil water content, whereas soil oxidases were correlated with soil total C and N contents. Overall, the soil total C content explained 41.9% of the variation in EEA and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry. These results provide an improved understanding of hydrolase and oxidase activities in response to extreme drought events, thereby facilitating the prediction of long-term C dynamics in peatlands.

AB Previous studies have shown a correspondence between the abundance of particular plant species and methane flux. Here, we apply multivariate analyses, and weighted averaging, to assess the suitability of vegetation composition as a predictor of methane flux. We developed a functional classification of the vegetation, in terms of a number of plant traits expected to influence methane production and transport, and compared this with a purely taxonomic classification at species level and higher. We applied weighted averaging and indirect and direct ordination approaches to six sites in the United Kingdom, and found good relationships between methane flux and vegetation composition (classified both taxonomically and functionally). Plant species and functional groups also showed meaningful responses to management and experimental treatments. In addition to the United Kingdom, we applied the functional group classification across different geographical regions (Canada and the Netherlands) to assess the generality of the method. Again, the relationship appeared good at the site level, suggesting some general applicability of the functional classification. The method seems to have the potential for incorporation into large-scale (national) greenhouse gas accounting programmes (in relation to peatland condition/management) using vegetation mapping schemes. The results presented here strongly suggest that robust predictive models can be derived using plant species data (for use in national-scale studies). For trans-national-scale studies, where the taxonomic assemblage of vegetation differs widely between study sites, a functional classification of plant species data provides an appropriate basis for predictive models of methane flux.

AB Natural organic matter (NOM) is a complex mixture of biogenic molecules resulting from the deposition and transformation of plant and animal matter. It has long been recognized that NOM plays an important role in many geological, geochemical, and environmental processes. Of particular concern is the fate of NOM in response to a warming climate in environments that have historically sequestered carbon (e.g., peatlands and swamps) but may transition to net carbon emitters. In this review, we will highlight developments in the application of high-field Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) in identifying the individual components of complex NOM mixtures, focusing primarily on the fraction that is dissolved in natural waters (dissolved organic matter or DOM). We will first provide some historical perspective on developments in FTICR technology that made molecular-level characterizations of DOM possible. A variety of applications of the technique will then be described, followed by our view of the future of high-field FTICR MS in carbon cycling research, including a particularly exciting metabolomic approach.

AB The Scottish Government is committed to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 (compared to a 1990-1995 baseline). Peatlands have been recognised as a key environment for the carbon balance as they sequester and store great quantities of carbon, but they also have the potential to release it. In Scotland, peatlands cover more than 20% of the surface (more than 90% of which is blanket bog) and store more than 2500 Mt of carbon. Blanket bogs are very climate reliant, and as a consequence of climate change, many areas in Scotland may not be able to support peatlands in the near future. In this study, two bioclimatic envelope models (Linsday Modified model and Blanket Bog Tree model) have been used to obtain a first estimate of how the distribution of blanket bogs in Scotland could vary according to climate change in the 2050s and in the 2080s. The potential losses of carbon arising from climate change have then been calculated. Results showed that in 2050, more than half of the carbon currently stored in Scottish blanket bogs will be at risk of loss. This is 4.4-6.6 times the amount of carbon emitted in 2016 from all the sectors in Scotland and, if emissions from peatland occur and are taken into account, it will greatly hamper efforts to meet emission reduction targets set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act of 2009.

TI Peatland degradation reduces methanogens and methane emissions from

AB Peatland degradation is expected to increase the rate of aerobic decomposition in surface soil (0-30 cm). Carbon stored in both the subsurface (30-60 cm) and deeper layers ( > 60 cm) of peatlands is also expected to be metabolized after degradation. However, little is known about how methane were emissions from subsurface and the deeper layers of peatlands during degradation. Three peatland degradation stages: S1, intact fen with high water table; S2, lightly degraded fen with a fluctuating water table; S3, heavily degraded fen with a lower water table were chosen to quantify the differences in CH4 emissions at different peatland degradation stages. CH4 emissions and methanogens of subsurface and deep soil were also measured to reveal the contribution rates of subsurface methane emission in this study. After four-years experiment, we found that the abundance of methanogens and methane emissions decreased as peatlands were more heavily degraded. We also found that the contribution rate of methane emission decreased from peat surface to subsurface and deep layer, and this trend varied with peatland degradation. A higher contribution rate was found in the subsurface methane emissions from S1 (32.63%) and S2 (19.94%). Importantly, when peatlands were heavily degraded, the subsurface changed from a CH4 source to a sink. Decreased methane emissions of the degraded peatlands was also associated with a high abundance of methanogens (R-2 = 0.75, p < 0.05). Thus, we conclude that peatland degradation reduces methanogens and methane emissions from both surface and deep soils. Peatland degradation induced aerobic condition and substrate limitation are the main reasons for the reduced methane emission from Zoige peatland.

AB The relative importance of global versus local environmental factors for growth and thus carbon uptake of the bryophyte genusSphagnum-the main peat-former and ecosystem engineer in northern peatlands-remains unclear. We measured length growth and net primary production (NPP) of two abundantSphagnumspecies across 99 Holarctic peatlands. We tested the importance of previously proposed abiotic and biotic drivers for peatland carbon uptake (climate, N deposition, water table depth and vascular plant cover) on these two responses. Employing structural equation models (SEMs), we explored both indirect and direct effects of drivers onSphagnumgrowth. Variation in growth was large, but similar within and between peatlands. Length growth showed a stronger response to predictors than NPP. Moreover, the smaller and denserSphagnum fuscumgrowing on hummocks had weaker responses to climatic variation than the larger and looserSphagnum magellanicumgrowing in the wetter conditions. Growth decreased with increasing vascular plant cover within a site. Between sites, precipitation and temperature increased growth forS. magellanicum. The SEMs indicate that indirect effects are important. For example, vascular plant cover increased with a deeper water table, increased nitrogen deposition, precipitation and temperature. These factors also influencedSphagnumgrowth indirectly by affecting moss shoot density. Synthesis. Our results imply that in a warmer climate,S. magellanicumwill increase length growth as long as precipitation is not reduced, whileS. fuscumis more resistant to decreased precipitation, but also less able to take advantage of increased precipitation and temperature. Such species-specific sensitivity to climate may affect competitive outcomes in a changing environment, and potentially the future carbon sink function of peatlands.

AB Recently, fen construction projects on surface mines in northeastern Alberta have been attempted as a reclamation strategy to reintroduce peatlands into the region where industry disturbs a substantial amount of wetland ecosystems. Knowledge of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics, including methane (CH4), is one way to understand the biogeochemical function of newly constructed fen ecosystems. In this study we monitored CH4 emissions and CH4 pore water concentration, as well as ecological and soil chemistry controls on CH4 emissions and pore water concentration, from a constructed fen. The same variables were also monitored at two natural reference fens that had similar vascular vegetation to the constructed fen. Methane emissions were lower at the constructed fen compared to the reference poor fen, but similar to the reference saline fen. However, CH4 concentration in pore water at 0.2 m and 0.7 m depth was lower at the constructed fen than either of the natural reference sites. The supply rate of sulfur (all mobile forms) was the most dominant control on CH4 emission and CH4 pore water concentration. While low CH4 emissions may be beneficial for constructed fens from a GHG perspective, this condition indicates that peat and carbon accumulation at these reclaimed sites may ensue slowly. Therefore, a clear statement of goals is required to determine how CH4 dynamics from constructed fen ecosystems relate to the reclamation outcome. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Worldwide, regularly recurring wildfires shape many peatland ecosystems to the extent that fire-adapted species often dominate plant communities, suggesting that wildfire is an integral part of peatland ecology rather than an anomaly. The most destructive blazes are smoldering fires that are usually initiated in periods of drought and can combust entire peatland carbon stores. However, peatland wildfires more typically occur as low-severity surface burns that arise in the dormant season when vegetation is desiccated, and soil moisture is high. In such low-severity fires, surface layers experience flash heating, but there is little loss of underlying peat to combustion. This study examines the potential importance of such processes in several peatlands that span a gradient from hemiboreal to tropical ecozones and experience a wide range of fire return intervals. We show that low-severity fires can increase the pool of stable soil carbon by thermally altering the chemistry of soil organic matter (SOM), thereby reducing rates of microbial respiration. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared, we demonstrate that low-severity fires significantly increase the degree of carbon condensation and aromatization of SOM functional groups, particularly on the surface of peat aggregates. Laboratory incubations show lower CO2 emissions from peat subjected to low-severity fire and predict lower cumulative CO2 emissions from burned peat after 1-3 years. Also, low-severity fires reduce the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of peat, indicating that these fires can inhibit microbial access to SOM. The increased stability of thermally altered SOM may allow a greater proportion of organic matter to survive vertical migration into saturated and anaerobic zones of peatlands where environmental conditions physiochemically protect carbon stores from decomposition for thousands of years. Thus, across latitudes, low-severity fire is an overlooked factor influencing carbon cycling in peatlands, which is relevant to global carbon budgets as climate change alters fire regimes worldwide.

AB The carbon density and the long-term (apparent) rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) in the mineral subsoil of boreal mires in Finland formed by paludification were studied by comparison to adjacent forest soil sites with similar podzolic texture and topography. On the basis of 273 soil profiles from six areas, the mean carbon density in the mineral subsoil of mire sites was 1.5-fold higher than in adjacent forest profiles. The average carbon input was 13.6 +/- 1.8 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1), which differed according to length of time since the onset of paludification. LORCA estimates were highest on the youngest mire sites (< 500 years) and agree with estimates obtained for peat deposits elsewhere in the boreal region. Bogs and topographically flat areas were found to have higher LORCA values than the fens and the topographically steeper areas. The carbon stored in podzols in boreal forest reach equilibrium with soil age after 1500-2000 years, while in the mineral subsoil of mires the equilibrium is reached after 4500-5000 pears after initial paludification. A direct comparison of carbon below mires to the equivalent depths of peat above indicates that peats are much more efficient in C sequestration. In this study, the average total C density in the mineral subsoil of mire areas to a depth of 70 cm from the bottom of the A horizon would correspond to a peat depth of about 18 cm. Still, the mineral subsoil under mires is a significant carbon sink, hitherto overlooked, and could account for some 5% of the unaccounted for carbon in the global carbon budget.

AB The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in alpine soils of the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have unique optical properties. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the photodegradation characteristics of DOM helps in revealing regional DOC dynamics and carbon cycle at the water-land interface in alpine soils. Typical soil samples of the subalpine forest and peat wetland were collected and DOM were extracted and cultivated, ultraviolet-visible absorbance and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy with two-dimensional correlation spectrum (2D-COS) and fluorescence regional integration (FRI) were used to characterize the environmental behavior responses to light irradiation. The results showed that the first-order decay constants and photodegradation rates of subalpine forest soil and alpine peat wetland soil were 0.0777 d(-1), 0.0907 d(-1) and 42.06%, 45.47%, respectively. The aromaticity and humification degree of CDOM in alpine soils were decreased with increasing exposure time. The FDOM in alpine soil showed four components (C1-C4), all components degraded in different degrees under light. According to the synchronous and asynchronous map, tyrosine- and tryptophan-like FDOM showed higher susceptibility in subalpine forest soil, while fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like FDOM showed higher susceptibility in alpine peat wetland soil. It confirmed that DOM of alpine soils showed good photodegradation characteristics, light might increase the instability of DOM in alpine soils.

AB Soil respiration is an important component of terrestrial carbon cycling and is sensitive to environmental change. Most previous studies focus on the effect of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration, whereas the impact of spatial heterogeneity (e.g., microtopography) is seldom studied.
   To test the impact of microtopography on soil respiration, we performed a field investigation to examine soil respiration, soil temperature, soil water content, soil total porosity, soil organic content, and plant biomass at a hummock site (composed of grass hummocks and inter-hummock areas) and an adjacent flat meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.
   Similar seasonal dynamics of soil respiration in the grass hummocks, inter-hummock areas, and flat meadow were found in the alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. However, soil respiration of the grass hummocks was 79.3% and 413.9% higher than that of the flat meadow during the growing (April, June, August) and non-growing seasons (October, December, February), respectively. Although there was no difference in soil respiration between the inter-hummock areas and the flat meadow during the non-growing season, soil respiration was 42.5% higher at the inter-hummock areas than the flat meadow during growing season. Larger soil porosity, greater surface area, and more substrate supply, but not more root growth, likely contributed to the higher soil respiration of grass hummocks.
   Our findings suggest that the impact of spatial heterogeneity on soil respiration should be taken into consideration to facilitate the accurate estimation of soil carbon fluxes at ecosystem and regional scales.

AB Boreal lake sediments are carbon sources by producing CO2. CO2 flux from sediments is partly controlled by turbulence in the water column, which is not given the same attention as CO2 production rates in current estimates of CO2 fluxes from sediments. We quantified the in situ CO2 flux across the sediment-water interface in a small (0.07km(2)) lake in Sweden by measuring the in situ O-2 flux with the Eddy Correlation (EC) method and using the apparent respiratory quotient (CO2 production:O-2 consumption) derived from sediment incubations. We demonstrate that median CO2 flux estimated by EC was similar to 70% smaller than estimated by sediment incubations with artificial water mixing (1.0x10(-2) and 3.6x10(-2)mu molCm(-2)s(-1), respectively). Additionally, we show that inducing artificial mixing of supernatant water in the incubation experiment has a positive effect on observed fluxes, enhancing CO2 flux by similar to 30% compared to not mixing supernatant water. We suggest that the difference between the methods is due to the strong artificial water mixing in sediment incubations compared to the turbulent mixing in this small lake. Additionally, low O-2 supply to sediment aerobic heterotrophic microbes during extended periods of low water currents can inhibit respiration and thus CO2 production. These findings suggest that the sediment contribution to total lake CO2 emission might currently be overestimated for small boreal lakes. Care should be taken when upscaling sediment CO2 flux derived from incubation experiments to entire basins of small lakes, as incubation experiments are unlikely to accurately mimic in situ bottom water currents and gas exchange.

AB Region 2 comprises arctic and subarctic North America and is underlain by continuous or discontinuous permafrost. Its freshwater systems are dominated by a low energy environment and cold region processes. Central northern areas are almost totally influenced by arctic air masses while Pacific air becomes more prominent in the west, Atlantic air in the east and southern air masses at the lower latitudes. Air mass changes will play an important role in precipitation changes associated with climate warming. The snow season in the region is prolonged resulting in long-term storage of water so that the spring flood is often the major hydrological event of the year, even though, annual rainfall usually exceeds annual snowfall. The unique character of ponds and lakes is a result of the long frozen period, which affects nutrient status and gas exchange during the cold season and during thaw. GCM models are in close agreement for this region and predict temperature increases as large as 4 degrees C in summer and 9 degrees C in winter for a 2 x CO? scenario. Palaeoclimate indicators support the probability that substantial temperature increases have occurred previously during the Holocene. The historical record indicates a temperature increase of >1 degrees C in parts of the region during the last century. GCM predictions of precipitation change indicate an increase, but there is little agreement amongst the various models on regional disposition or magnitude. Precipitation change is as important as temperature change in determining the water balance. The water balance is critical to every aspect of hydrology and limnology in the far north. Permafrost close to the surface plays a major role in freshwater systems because it often maintains lakes and wetlands above an impermeable frost table, which limits the water storage capabilities of the subsurface. Thawing associated with climate change would, particularly in areas of massive ice, stimulate landscape changes, which can affect every aspect of the environment. The normal spring flooding of ice-jammed north-flowing rivers, such as the Mackenzie, is a major event, which renews the water supply of lakes in delta regions and which determines the availability of habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate warming or river damming and diversion would probably lead to the complete drying of many delta lakes. Climate warning would also change the characteristics of ponds that presently freeze to the bottom and result in fundamental changes in their limnological characteristics. At present, the food chain is rather simple usually culminating in lake trout or arctic char. A lengthening of the growing season and warmer water temperature would affect the chemical, mineral and nutrient status of lakes and most likely have deleterious effects on the food chain. Peatlands are extensive in region 2. They would move northwards at their southern boundaries, and, with sustained drying, many would change form or become inactive, Extensive wetlands and peatlands are an important component of the global carbon budget, and warmer and drier conditions would most likely change them from a sink to a source for atmospheric carbon. There is some evidence that this may be occurring already. Region 2 is very vulnerable to global warming. Its freshwater systems are probably the least studied and most poorly understood in North America.
   There are clear needs to improve our current knowledge of temperature and precipitation patterns; to model the thermal behaviour of wetlands, lakes and rivers; to understand better the interrelationships of cold region rivers with their basins; to begin studies on the very large lakes in the region; to obtain a firm grasp of the role of northern peatlands in the global carbon cycle; and to link the terrestrial water balance to the thermal and hydrological regime of the polar sea. Overall there is a strong need for basic research and long-term monitoring. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Sphagnum (peatmoss) dominates huge areas of the Northern Hemisphere and acts as a significant carbon sink on a global scale, yet little is known about the genetic structure of Sphagnum populations. We investigated genetic structure within a population of the common peatmoss Sphagnum fuscum, to assess local patterns of genetic diversity and the spatial extent of clones. One hundred seventeen shoots were sampled from five transects in Fuglmyra, central Norway, and sequenced for three anonymous DNA regions. Five neighbourhood patches were marked along each transect, and from each patch, five stems were sampled for molecular analyses. Seventeen haplotypes could be distinguished and two major groups of haplotypes differed by 12 mutational steps. The two major haplotype groups differed significantly in microhabitat association along the distance to groundwater table and the pH gradients, indicating microhabitat differentiation. The haplotypes within these groups were all genetically similar, differing by one or two mutations. The most common haplotype occurred in four transects separated by 250-m distance. Most of the molecular variation in the population was found among transects, and within patches. Large dominating clones within each transect resulted in low variation explained by the among-patch-within-transect component of spatial structure. Mutation appears to account for a larger proportion of the population variation than recombination. Within the population, vegetative growth and asexual reproduction from gametophyte fragments dominate as the main reproductive mode.

AB Progresses in reconstructing Earth's history of biomass burning has motivated the development of a modern charcoal dataset covering the last decades through a community-based initiative called the Global Modern Charcoal Dataset (GMCD). As the frequency, intensity and spatial scale of fires are predicted to increase regionally and globally in conjunction with changing climate, anthropogenic activities and land-use patterns, there is an increasing need to further understand, calibrate and interrogate recent and past fire regimes as related to changing fire emissions and changing carbon sources and sinks. Discussions at the PAGES Global Paleofire Working Group workshop 2015, including paleoecologists, numerical modelers, statisticians, paleochmatologists, archeologists, and anthropologists, identified an urgent need for an open, standardized, quality-controlled and globally representative dataset of modern sedimentary charcoal and other sediment-based fire proxies. This dataset fits into a gap between metrics of biomass burning indicators, current fire regimes and land cover, and carbon emissions inventories. The dataset will enable the calibration of paleofire data with other modern datasets including: data of satellite derived fire occurrence, vegetation patterns and species diversity, land cover change, and a range of sources capturing biochemical cycling. Standardized protocols are presented for collecting and analyzing sediment-based fire proxies, including charcoal, levoglucosan, black carbon, and soot. The GMCD will provide a publically-accessible repository of modern fire sediment surface samples in all terrestrial ecosystems. Sample collection and contributions to the dataset will be solicited from lacustrine, peat, marine, glacial, or other sediments, from a wide variety of ecosystems and geographic locations.

AB We aimed to select microorganisms colonizing torrefied grass fibres (TGF) and simultaneously reducing the phytotoxicity which appeared after heat treatment of the fibres. Eighty-eight bacterial strains and one fungus, previously isolated from a sequential enrichment experiment on torrefied fibres and extracts, were tested separately for their capacity to decrease phytotoxicity. Eleven of the bacterial strains and the fungus significantly reduced phytotoxicity. These organisms were checked for their ability to grow on agar containing phenol, 2-methoxyphenol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, 2-furalaldehyde, pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde and furan-2-methanol as sole carbon sources. The fungus F/TGF15 and the bacterial strain 66/TGF15 were able to grow on all six compounds. Strains 15/TGE5, 23/TGE5, 43/TGE20, 56/TGF10 and 95/TGF15 grew on two to four compounds, and strain 72/TGF15 only on one compound. Strains 31/TGE5, 34/TGE5, 48/TGE20 and 70/TGF15 did not grow on any of the single toxic compounds. GC analyses of torrefied grass extracts (TGE) determined which compounds were removed by the microorganisms. F/TGF15 was the only isolate depleting phenol, 2-methoxyphenol, 2-dihydrofuranone and pyrrole-2,5-dione-3-ethyl-4-methyl. Strains 15/TGE5, 23/TGE5, 31/TGE5 and 56/TGF10, and the fungus depleted 2-furalaldehyde, 2-furan-carboxaldehyde-5-methyl, pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde, 5-acetoxymethyl-2-furaldehyde and benzaldehyde-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy. These promising candidates for colonizing and simultaneously reducing the phytotoxicity of TGF were affiliated with Pseudomonas putida, Serratia plymuthica, Pseudomonas corrugata, Methylobacterium radiotolerans and Coniochaeta ligniaria.

AB Samples of detrital lignite have been collected for detailed organic geochemical and carbon isotope analyses from the First Lusatian lignite seam at the Adamow, Jozwin IIB and Tomislawice opencast mines, deposited after the last peak of the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. Carbon isotopic compositions of biomarkers from Polish lignite are reported for the first time. The aim of the study is to improve the chemotaxonomic value of biomarkers by relating the results to existing paleobotanical data, and to gain information about the influencing factors on delta C-13 of lignite and lipids. Furthermore, biomarker and isotopic proxies are tested for their applicability in paleoclimate studies.
   The molecular composition of the extracted lipids is highly variable, including leaf-wax n-alkanes in the C-23 to C-31 range, diterpenoids, hopanoids, and angiosperm-derived triterpenoids, as well as saturated fatty acids, long-chain n-alkanols and n-alkan-2-ones. The relative abundances of mid-chain (C-23, C-25) nalkanes and their 1-2 parts per thousand higher delta C-13 values compared to long-chain n-alkanes (C-29, C-31) argue for a minor contribution of macrophytes (graminoids, etc.) to peat formation, enhanced during periods of raised water level. The presence of ferruginol and dehydroferruginol testifies the contribution of Taxodiaceae. The abundances of pimarane-type diterpenoids and the presence of non-aromatic abietane-derivatives argue for the contribution of Pinaceae. Based on the presence of lupeol and lupane-type triterpenoids, an input of Betulaceae can be concluded. The contribution of further angiosperms cannot be specified based on the composition of pentacyclic triterpenoids. However, the results indicate mixed vegetation, and are in agreement with paleobotanical data highlighting abundant conifers of the Taxodiaceae/Cupressaceae and Pinaceae families, as well as angiosperms of various families (e.g., Nyssa, Quercus, Fagus), including Betulaceae (e.g., Alnus, Betula, Corylus). Based on the relationship between the carbon preference index of n-alkanes and mean annual air temperatures, obtained from a global database of peatlands, an average temperature of 24.5 degrees C is obtained. This value is significantly higher as estimated from paleobotanical data (15.7-19.7 degrees C), probably due to the influence of changes in vegetation on carbon preference index.
   The relative abundances of diterpenoids versus di- plus angiosperm-derived triterpenoids in detrital lignite samples revealed variable contributions of gymnosperms and angiosperms during the middle Miocene. Consistent with these results, a positive relationship exists between the di-/(di- + tri-) terpenoid biomarker ratios and delta C-13 of lignite samples, indicating the dominating role of varying gymnosperm/ angiosperm contributions on the carbon isotopic composition of lignite. The C-isotope data of long-chain n-alkanes, diterpenoids, and angiosperm-derived triterpenoids co-vary within the profiles, arguing for an overall control of changes in delta C-13 of atmospheric CO2 on delta C-13 of plant lipids. Fluctuations in delta C-13 of individual compounds may also be related to changes in carbon cycling within the peat, humidity and air temperature. The influence of local variations in ambient CO2 (e.g., the canopy effect) cannot be excluded. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Questions: What are the long-term effects of climate change on the plant species composition and carbon sequestration in peat bogs?
   Methods: We developed a bog ecosystem model that includes vegetation, carbon, nitrogen and water dynamics. Two groups of vascular plant species and three groups of Sphagnum species compete with each other for light and nitrogen. The model was tested by comparing the outcome with long-term historic vegetation changes in peat cores from Denmark and England. A climate scenario was used to analyse the future effects of atmospheric CO2, temperature and precipitation.
   Results: The main changes in the species composition since 1766 were simulated by the model. Simulations for a future warmer, and slightly wetter, climate with doubling CO2 concentration suggest that little will change in species composition, due to the contrasting effects of increasing temperatures ( favouring vascular plants) and CO2 ( favouring Sphagnum). Further analysis of the effects of temperature showed that simulated carbon sequestration is negatively related to vascular plant expansion. Model results show that increasing temperatures may still increase carbon accumulation at cool, low N deposition sites, but decrease carbon accumulation at high N deposition sites.
   Conclusions: Our results show that the effects of temperature, precipitation, N-deposition and atmospheric CO2 are not straightforward, but interactions between these components of global change exist. These interactions are the result of changes in vegetation composition. When analysing long-term effects of global change, vegetation changes should be taken into account and predictions should not be based on temperature increase alone.

AB In an attempt to utilize large amounts of Japanese beetles,Popillia japonica(Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) that were captured using a mass trapping system, compost using Japanese beetle carcasses was prepared with the layer method. Carbon sources included shredded paper, wood chips and leaves, while the sole nitrogen source was frozen Japanese beetles. In addition, Japanese beetle-based vermicompost was prepared in the greenhouse by mixing the Japanese beetle-based compost with sphagnum peat moss and moist shredded paper and exposing this mixture to composting earthworms (Eisenia fetida). Chemical analyses of the Japanese beetle carcasses indicated that 10.8% of their body weight is nitrogen (N). Analyses of the resulting Japanese beetle-based compost and vermicompost indicated that both types of materials are good quality soil amendments. Greenhouse studies were conducted to quantify the effects of varying proportions of Japanese beetle-based vermicompost and compost mixed with a potting medium and varying dosages of synthetic fertilizer 20-0-0, on mean fresh and dry weight of lettuce shoots and leaf area. Japanese beetle-based compost and vermicompost increased lettuce biomass to an extent that was comparable with the addition of synthetic N-based fertilizer. A mixture of 15 and 30% of each compost type with potting media significantly increased plant weight and leaf area compared with potting medium alone. Results indicate that composting and vermicomposting insect carcasses are a simple, effective and affordable method to augment fertilization in support of organic production.

AB Changes in hydrological conditions are expected and may alter carbon cycling in peatlands. Peat aeration with water table change has not commonly been investigated, and the water table is often assumed to constitute the oxic-anoxic boundary in peat. We analyzed temperature, moisture, oxygen (O-2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in profiles of a temperate fen during two seasons. A drying-rewetting cycle and flooding were induced and compared to controls. The response of moisture and water table position varied greatly and was related to gradients of peat compaction and ash content. Background drought raised air-filled porosity (AFP) to a maximum of 15%-38% in shallow peat and experimental drought up to 50%. Decline in water table and soil moisture broadly led to O-2 penetration and CO2 degassing, and rewetting and flooding led to anoxic conditions and CO2 accumulation in peat pore water. In dense peat with >= 20% ash content the unsaturated zone remained partly low in oxygen, however, and up to 5% AFP and 20 cm above water table O-2 concentrations frequently remained below 50 mu mol L-1. Moderately intense and short drying did not induce substantial oxygen penetration in the compacted soil profiles. The likelihood of the presence of oxygen in the peat was predicted by logistic regression using water table and ash content or bulk density as predictors (p < 0.0005). The model is potentially useful for predicting the position of the redoxcline in peat deposits and may assist in improving statistical models of trace gas emission from peatlands.

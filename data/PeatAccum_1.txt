AB We investigated early root development of Pinus sylvestris seedlings in relation to bulk density and natural particle layering in an ectorganic soil layer from a bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) stand. Responses in root development to two levels of bulk density (0.07 and 0.15 g/cm(3)) in mixed bracken substrate were compared with effects in peat of similar bulk densities, and in sand of three different bulk densities (0.37, 0.52, and 0.67 g/cm(3)). The effect on root growth of the natural horizontal layering of the organic particles was examined by comparing intact with mixed ectorganic bracken soil profiles of similar bulk densities (resp. 0.09 and 0.07 g/cm(3)).
   Root length growth was significantly reduced in the organic and sandy substrates of high bulk density. Root diameter was not affected by bulk density in the organic substrate, but increased with higher bulk density in sand. Preservation of horizontal layering in the intact ectorganic profile significantly reduced root length compared with mixed substrate of similar bulk density.
   Roots growing in high bulk density, and intact, organic substrate showed increased twisting, which resulted in a smaller depth reached by the root relative to total root length produced. In sand, root twisting did not change with increased bulk density. It is suggested that roots growing through organic substrate follow a path of least resistance. This implies that organic particle size and orientation are more important in determining root development than bulk density.
   This study points out that the natural layering of organic particles presents another constraint on the establishment of plant species in sites with a well-developed ectorganic soil layer. Disturbance of this layer may therefore enhance establishment of seedlings by reducing the mechanical resistance of the ectorganic soil profile to developing seedling roots.

TI THE DETERMINATION OF THE BULK-DENSITY OF PEAT SOILS
SO AGRIBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR AGRARBIOLOGIE AGRIKULTURCHEMIE
   OKOLOGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB The dry bulk density of peat can be calculated from the particle density and water content of the peat. Raised bog peat and fen peat, on average, have a particle density of about 1600 g/l. In late summer the pores of the peat usually contain 80 % to 90 % water. Using these figures, the dry bulk density can be calculated from the dry matter (see equation 8). The differences between the calculated and empirical values are about 11 %.
   An analysis of 330 peat soils of the Institute of Soil Technology shows that it is easier to use the following equation: rho(t) (g/l) = 10 . TM - 7.2, where rho(t) is the dry bulk density (in g/l) and TM = dry matter (%).
   Sufficiently exact dry bulk density values can be obtained with this equation. It has been tested only on peat from northwestern Germany and is valid up to a dry matter of less than 60 %.

ID ORGANIC-MATTER; FILLED POROSITY; SOILS
AB Air permeability was measured as a function of gravimetric water content and dry bulk density for six sieved, repacked porous materials with organic matter contents ranging from 0 to 88%. The six media used were two relatively fine sandy soils, a filter sand, a peat soil, and two commercial composts made from sewage sludge and yard waste, respectively. The materials were initially wetted from air dry to the desired water content, after which measurements were done. Selected combinations of material gravimetric water content and dry bulk density were used in the permeability measurements. The combinations were selected to cover the entire possible ranges of water content and dry bulk density for each material. The six materials exhibited very different relationships between air permeability, water content, and dry bulk density, exhibiting both increasing and decreasing air permeability with water content depending on their structural behavior. All six materials had regions in their water content-dry bulk density domains where air permeability tended to increase with increasing water content, indicative of increasing structure formation in these regions. This tendency was strongest for the two sandy soils and weakest for the filter sand, which exhibited almost no structure formation. Increased structure, as indicated by increasing air permeability with increasing water content, was strongest for low values of dry bulk density in all six materials.

DE pine bog; peat; bulk density; chemical properties; fertilization
AB Bulk densities and chemical properties of surface peat (0-60 cm) of three ombrotrophic pine bogs were measured before and three growing seasons after fertilization. One site was located in each of the countries Norway, Sweden and Finland. Bulk density of peat ranged from 56 in Norway, 78 in Sweden to 130 g dm(-3) in Finland. Bulk density seems to vary along a sub-coastal to sub-continental gradient for the bog type. When compared to the biological demands of the tree stands, the surface peat stores of extractable K, P and B were low before fertilization. Depletion from the peat on fertilized plots (uptake and/or leaching) were rather high for K, B, Mn and Zn. Especially the sodium borate (borax fertilizer) was susceptible to leaching. Only minor changes occurred in pH and cation exchange capacity after fertilization, whereas base saturation was raised, especially in the upper layer (010 cm). A high proportion of total K, Ca, Mg, Mn and Zn were on exchangeable sites (63-92%), while P, S. B and Fe were mainly fixed (72-95%). Estimated net carbon loss from the peat at drainage was 100 g C m(-2) year(-1), while at additional fertilization the loss was only 6 g.

AB Bulk density is a key determinant of numerous physical characteristics in peat including hydraulic conductivity, smouldering combustion vulnerability, and water retention in the unsaturated zone. A Markov chain model based on peat type (primarily Sphagnum, sedge, and sylvic peats) was applied to the depth-wise structure of boreal peatlands using 143 cores from western Canada as source data. Bulk density and peat type were modelled in 2160 simulated peat profiles by driving Markov chains associated with bulk density distributions by peat type and depth. The model closely reproduced the expected change in bulk density between vertically adjacent peat horizons. Markov-derived peat profiles showed somewhat greater variance in organic matter load in the upper 135 cm compared to observed cores due to the lack of whole-profile bias or trends in density. The method and derived Markov chains shown here have utility in hydrological modelling, regional carbon estimates, and in the modelling of disturbances such as wildfire.

TI COMPRESSIBILITY OF SOME TRINIDADIAN SOILS AS AFFECTED BY THE
   INCORPORATION OF PEAT
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURAL SOILS
AB The effect on compressibility of incorporating peat into four remoulded Trinidadian agricultural soils was investigated over a range of stresses from 0 to 1000 kPa using a compression machine. Air-dry peat was applied at four levels (0, 4, 8 and 12% by mass) to the soils (two sandy loams, clay loam and clay) and tested at three moisture contents close to the Proctor optimum moisture content of the soils. Compression curves (bulk density versus log applied stress) for each soil at the moisture levels tested were almost linear and parallel over the range of stresses from about 100 to 1000 kPa.
   Mean values of dry bulk density declined significantly at 0.001 level with increasing peat content from 1.23 to 0.87 Mg m(-3). Mean bulk density values increased significantly at 0.001 level with increasing applied stress and moisture content and declined with increasing clay content. Significant interaction effects were observed between soil type and peat content and between peat content and moisture content. Feat incorporation resulted in greater soil compression, but the increases were less evident in clay than in sandy loam soils. Soil compression refers to the decrease in soil volume with the application of external load. The compression index, C (slope of the dry bulk density versus log applied stress relationship), increased significantly at 0.05 level from 0.21 Mg/m(3) in one sandy loam soil to 0.38 Mg/m(3) in the clay soil. While the C value did not differ significantly with increasing peat content in the sandy loams and the clay loam, it decreased significantly at 0.01 level in the clay soil. An equation expressing C as a function of initial soil bulk density before compression and a strain parameter was developed in order to explain the variation of C in the soils tested. A method is described that can be adopted to quantify the effect of peat on soil compressibility.

AB Peat compression can significantly alter the hydraulic parameters that govern flow and storage of water. Physical properties of peat (bulk density, state of decomposition (von Post number, vP) and fibre content) were assessed to determine whether they can be used as indicators of peat compressibility. Bulk density and vP were related to each other (positively), and within a given core were related (negatively) to compressibility. Peat from different locations exhibited different compressibility characteristics for a given value of bulk density or vP. Fibre content was unrelated to bulk density, vP, or to peat compressibility. It was concluded that more commonly and relatively easily measured soil parameters are not good indicators of soil compressibility. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Bulk density, total contents of N, P, K, Ca and Fe and field- and laboratory-incubated mineral-N were determined for a bog and fen site 3 years after drainage treatments (3 m and 15 m ditch spacings), tilling treatments (untilled, tilled) and fertilization treatments (unfertilized, PK-fertilized), as well as for adjacent untreated (undisturbed) areas of the bog and fen, Tilling of the surface or fertilization did not significantly affect total nutrient contents in either bog or fen, although nutrient contents were generally higher in fertilization or drainage treatments that included tilling, As a result of decreased ditch spacing (from 15 m to 3 m), bulk density was significantly increased in the bog site (from 44.9 to 63.5 mg cm(-3)) and decreased (non-significant) in the fen site (from 105 to 89 mg cm(-3)). Total P and K were increased where PK was applied as fertilizer. In bog peats, bulk density (mg cm(-3)), total N concentrations (mg g(-1)) and total contents (kg ha(-1)) of N, P, K, Ca and Fe were significantly higher in the 3 m ditch spacing than in the 15 m ditch spacing. Thus, increases in total nutrient contents in bog peats can be attributed mainly to increased bulk density as a result of drainage treatment. in contrast, bulk densities and most nutrient contents of fen peats were not significantly affected by treatments. However, total N concentrations and total N contents were significantly reduced by more intensive ditching (3 m ditch spacing). Contents of mineral N in fresh pear and field-incubated and laboratory anaerobically incubated (30 degrees C) peat consisted entirely of NH4-N. Laboratory incubations over a 20-week period demonstrated a high potential for release of NH4-N in peat from treated sites of bog and fen. During four 28-day field incubation periods, production of mineral-N varied from 0.1 to 1.2 kg ha(-1) (net mineralization) to -0.1 to -0.3 kg ha(-1) (net immobilization) for bog peat. Similarly, on the fen site production ranged from 0.1 to 2.7 kg ha(-1) (net mineralization) and -0.1 to -1.7 kg ha(-1) (net immobilization). In the unfertilized and PK-fertilized treatments of the fen, as well as the PK-fertilized treatment of the bog, net immobilization predominated during the first incubation period, followed by net mineralization during the next three incubation periods. In the unfertilized treatment of the bog, net mineralization predominated early in the growing season, followed by net immobilization thereafter.

AB The total porosity of a container medium is often inaccurate when determined from a water release curve because the use of the total porosity value and bulk density in the equation, Total porosity = (1 - bulk density/particle density) x 100, gives an unrealistic value for particle density.  The inaccuracy seems to be caused by incomplete saturation of the medium sample at zero suction.  Total porosity should be calculated using bulk density and particle density, rather than equating total porosity with the zero suction value on the water release curve.  The zero suction value is a measure of effective porosity since it does not take into account trapped air in the medium.

AB The boreal biome is characterised by extensive wildfires that frequently burn into the thick organic soils found in many forests and wetlands. Previous studies investigating surface fuel consumption generally have not accounted for variation in the properties of organic soils or how this affects the severity of fuel consumption. We experimentally altered soil moisture profiles of peat monoliths collected from several vegetation types common in boreal bogs and used laboratory burn tests to examine the effects of depth-dependent variation in bulk density and moisture on depth of fuel consumption. Depth of burning ranged from 1 to 17 cm, comparable with observations following natural wildfires. Individually, fuel bulk density and moisture were unreliable predictors of depth of burning. However, they demonstrated a cumulative influence on the thermodynamics of downward combustion propagation. By modifying Van Wagner's surface fuel consumption model to account for stratigraphic changes in fuel conditions, we were able to accurately predict the maximum depth of fuel consumption for most of the laboratory burn tests. This modified model for predicting the depth of surface fuel consumption in boreal ecosystems may provide a useful framework for informing wildland fire management activities and guiding future development of operational fire behaviour and carbon emission models.

TI Milled-peat compressibility sensor
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A sensor for continuously measuring milled-peat bulk density at a reference moisture content of 45% w.b. was constructed. The sensor compressed milled peat by 45% by volume because laboratory experiments revealed that when milled peat is compressed by this amount then the pressure generated is correlated (R = 0.863) with milled-peat bulk density at 45% m.c.w.b. A mechanical sensor consisting of two compression rollers was constructed which measured pressure exerted by the compression rollers on the milled peat by means of a load cell. The output signal from the sensor (load cell), produced a signal linearly proportional to milled-peat bulk density at the reference moisture content of 45% w.b. (R = 0.853).

TI MOTOR-DRIVEN PORTABLE SOIL CORE SAMPLER FOR VOLUMETRIC SAMPLING
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Note
AB An improved soil core sampler was tested for measuring bulk densities and volumetric water contents of field soils.  The improvements consist of (i) a portable gasoline-driven mechanical hammer and (ii) a wide cut-out trough with removable cover.  The improved hammer uses high-frequency vibrations to drive the core sampler into the soil at an even speed without interruption, thus preventing compaction.  The new trough allows free access for sampling the soil core with 205-cm3 steel cylinders.  Samples were taken by the improved soil core sampler and by hand in sand, silt loam, and clayey peat soils.  Comparison of these samples showed that the improved soil core sampler provides volumetric soil samples that are sufficiently accurate in bulk density and volumetric water content as those taken manually.

TI Characterizing the bulk density of compost
SO COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The bulk density of compressible materials depends on the compressive load to which they are subjected. This results in bulk density variation within piles of such materials. However, it is difficult to measure bulk density in situ without disturbing the sample or changing the load on it. A laboratory method was developed to simulate the variation of density with depth of material. The method was used with compost, wood shavings, straw and peat and simulated material depths of up to 3.5 meters. The variation of bulk density with depth was shown to follow a power function relationship where the exponent provided an indication of the compressibility of a material. Effective density is proposed as a useful single descriptor of bulk density. Both effective density and material compressibility were shown to be influenced by the size of container used to obtain measurements. A medium sized container (400-mm diameter and 380-mm fill height) provided a good compromise between accuracy and practicality.

AB Our understanding of hydraulic properties of peat soils is limited compared with that of mineral substrates. In this study, we aimed to deduce possible alterations of hydraulic properties of peat soils following degradation resulting from peat drainage and aeration. A data set of peat hydraulic properties (188 soil water retention curves [SWRCs], 71 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves [UHCs], and 256 saturated hydraulic conductivity [K-s] values) was assembled from the literature; the obtained data originated from peat samples with an organic matter (OM) content ranging from 23 to 97 wt% (weight percent; and according variation in bulk density) representing various degrees of peat degradation. The Mualem-van Genuchten model was employed to describe the SWRCs and UHCs. The results show that the hydraulic parameters of peat soils vary over a wide range confirming the pronounced diversity of peat. Peat decomposition significantly modifies all hydraulic parameters. A bulk density of approximately 0.2 g cm(-3) was identified as a critical threshold point; above and below this value, macroporosity and hydraulic parameters follow different functions with bulk density. Pedotransfer functions based on physical peat properties (e.g., bulk density and soil depth) separately computed for bog and fen peat have significantly lower mean square errors than functions obtained from the complete data set, which indicates that not only the status of peat decomposition but also the peat-forming plants have a large effect on hydraulic properties. The SWRCs of samples with a bulk density of less than 0.2 g cm(-3) could be grouped into two to five classes for each peat type (botanical composition). The remaining SWRCs originating from samples with a bulk density of larger than 0.2 g cm(-3) could be classified into one group. The Mualem-van Genuchten parameter values of alpha can be used to estimate K-s if no K-s data are available. In conclusion, the derived pedotransfer functions provide a solid instrument to derive hydraulic parameter values from easily measurable quantities; however, additional research is required to reduce uncertainty.

AB Peatland moss communities play an important role in ecosystem function. Drivers such as fire and atmospheric pollution have the capacity to influence mosses via multiple pathways. Here, we investigate physical and chemical processes which may influence establishment and growth of three key moss species in peatlands.
   A controlled factorial experiment investigated the effects of different peat bulk density, ash deposition and rainwater chemistry treatments on the growth of Sphagnum capillifolium, S. fallax and Campylopus introflexus.
   Higher peat bulk density limited growth of both Sphagnum species. S. capillifolium and C. introflexus responded positively to ash deposition. Less polluted rain limited growth of C. introflexus. Biomass was well correlated with percentage cover in all three species.
   Peat bulk density increases caused by fire or drainage can limit Sphagnum establishment and growth, potentially threatening peatland function. Ash inputs may have direct benefits for some Sphagnum species, but are also likely to increase competition from other bryophytes and vascular plants which may offset positive effects. Rainwater pollution may similarly increase competition to Sphagnum, and could enhance positive effects of ash addition on C. introflexus growth. Finally, cover can provide a useful approximation of biomass where destructive sampling is undesirable.

TI Smoldering characteristics of high bulk density peat

DT Article
DE Peat smoldering; High bulk density peat; Peat characterization
AB Low-density peats from many countries have long been studied by many authors. They are mostly forest and moss peats. Different peat types, from different locations in the world, may present degradation behavior that differs significantly. Bulk density, which is one the most important physical parameters governing the smoldering dynamics of solid fuels, varies among countries' peatlands. This work compares experimental data for low (200 kg m(-3)) and high (450 kg m(-3)) bulk density peat smoldering in a test bench. Peat sam-ples with different densities, organic matter contents, and particle sizes were considered in this work. The physicochemical characterization included ultimate analysis, ash composition, the density of the solid, and thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric analysis. The influences of the organic matter content, as well as the bulk surface area to volume ratio on peat burning, are also discussed. It is showed that, for the same organic matter and bulk surface area to volume ratio, the high bulk density peat burning rate is as low as one-third of the low bulk density peat burning rate. Once the High Heating Value of both peats is found similar, this lower burning rate is related to chemical kinetics, which shows higher oxidation temperature, around 500 degrees C for the high bulk density peat, and 300 degrees C for the low bulk density peat. For the high bulk density peat, the higher the bulk surface area to volume ratio the higher both horizontal and vertical smoldering spread rates. (c) 2020 The Combustion Institute.

AB Studies were conducted to ascertain the suitability of mineral wool (MW), either alone or in combination with sphagnum peat moss, as a substrate for potted greenhouse plants. Two types of hydrophyllic mineral wools, cleaned mineral wool (CMW) and uncleaned mineral wool (UMW), were used. Unamended CMW had a low bulk density, excellent water holding capacity, good aeration, but a high pH. Once peat moss was added to the CMW, bulk density remained low, water holding capacity remained good, and the pH dropped to a more suitable level. Unamended UMW had a high bulk density, good water holding capacity, poor aeration, and a high pH. Once peat moss was added to UMW, bulk density decreased, water holding capacity remained good, aeration increased, and the pH decreased to a more optimal level. CMW and UMW, were used unamended, as well as amended with 25%, 50%, and 75% pear moss. Two bedding plants, Impatiens walleriana 'Dazzler Violet' and Begonia semperflorens 'Whiskey' were grown for six and nine weeks respectively, and Euphorbia pulcherrima 'Glory' was grown for 20 weeks, in nine different substrates. Plants grown in unamended CMW and UMW were generally smaller in size and lower in fresh weight than plants grown in 50% MW/50% peat moss. The plants grown in MW with either 25% or 75% peat moss were similar in size and weight to plants grown in 50% MW/50% peat moss. Plant tissue analysis showed that generally plants were receiving adequate nutrition.

AB Smouldering peat fires are reported across continents and their emissions result in regional haze crisis (large scale accumulation of smoke at low altitudes) and large carbon foot prints. Inorganic content (IC) and bulk density vary naturally in peatlands and are among the important parameters governing peat fires. However, their roles in fire emissions remain unknown. In this work, bench-scale burning of sphagnum peat conditioned to different values of IC and bulk densities were conducted in the laboratory environment. Mass loss rate, spread rate and transient emissions of 20 gas species and particles (PM10, PM2.5 and PK1) were simultaneously investigated. We found that peat with 50% moisture content can self-sustain smouldering propagation if IC is less than 40%, or its bulk density is lower than 287.5 kg m(-3). Increasing IC or bulk density decreases peat mass loss rate and spread rate. High IC peat releases lower gas fluxes (especially for CH4 and NH3) throughout the experiment. In the ignition stage, increasing IC leads to an increase in particles with diameter between 1 and 2.5 mu m; in the fire spread stage, IC has no influence on the particle fluxes. In contrast, increasing bulk density delays both gas and particle emission fluxes without altering the smoke composition significantly. The fundamental understanding of how soil properties affect peat wildfires facilitates the development of mitigation technologies against haze.

AB Feat, plant matter that is partially fossilized, is formed in poorly oxygenated wetlands where the rate at which the plant matter accumulates is greater than the rate at which it decomposes. Pear is a common solid fuel ranking among coal, coke, wood, and sugarcane bagasse. It has also been used to recover oil during the remediation processes of contaminated water and soil. Because of its high moisture content, peat has a high potential as biofuel material for gasification. However, proper understanding of the physical and thermochemical properties of peat is necessary for the design of thermochemical conversion systems.
   This study provides information on moisture content, bulk density, particle size, heating values, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, ash composition, and ash fusibility characteristics of uncontaminated and diesel-contaminated peat. The moisture content of uncontaminated peat was 7.10%, whereas that of diesel-contaminated peat ranged from 8.65% to 10.80%. The bulk density for the uncontaminated peat was 151 kg/m(3), which increased to 391-534 kg/m(3) due to diesel contamination. Most of the particles (60%) were in the form of dust. The results also showed an ash content of 3.23% and the lower hearing value of 17.65 MJ / kg (day weight basis) for the uncontaminated peat. The ash content decreased substantially, whereas the lower heating value increased due to diesel contamination. The ash fusion temperature of the peat was found to be over 1100 degrees C.

AB The consumption of large areas of peat during wildfires is due to self-sustained smouldering fronts that can remain active for weeks. We studied the effect of peat moisture content and bulk density on the horizontal propagation of smouldering fire in laboratory-scale experiments. We used milled peat with moisture contents between 25 and 250% (mass of water per mass of dry peat) and bulk densities between 50 and 150kg m(-3). An infrared camera monitored ignition, spread and extinction of each smouldering combustion front. Peats with a bulk density below 75kg m(-3) and a moisture content below 150% self-sustained smouldering propagation for more than 12cm. Peat with a bulk density of 150kg m(-3) could self-sustain smouldering propagation up to a critical moisture content of 115%. A linear model estimated that increasing both moisture content and bulk density significantly reduced the median fire spread rate (which ranged between 1 and 5cm h(-1)). Moisture content had a stronger effect size on the spread rate than bulk density. However, the effect of bulk density on spread rate depends upon the moisture content, with the largest effect of bulk density at low moisture contents.

AB Soil hydraulic properties of drained and cultivated fen soils vary considerably due to structural and physical alteration in the long-term. Although hydrological modelling is a key method to determine soil water conditions for a large number of aims, for instance the utilization of fen soils, general estimators of water retention that reflect the progressive nature of fen soil alteration are rare. Based on 405 horizons from 30 fen soil profiles at 12 different peatland sites in Germany soil hydraulic properties were estimated. Water retention and bulk density measurements were conducted fivefold per each horizon mapped after the German Soil Taxonomy. Considering the varying phases of moorsh-forming process, bulk densities and water retention data were clustered according to horizon category by applying the k-means method. This approach reduced the range of water contents measured at considered pressure heads (pF) and recommended their subdivision into three groups of graduated bulk density (high, moderate, low) per each horizon category. This subdivision resulted in 18 separated data sets for parameterisation of the selected van Genuchten model using the RETC software. Estimated water content at saturation ranged between 0.68 and 0.90 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.10 and 0.35 cm(3) cm(-3) at a pF-value of 4.2. Shape parameter a varied stronger than n, especially for the strongly altered fen soil horizons. The continuing alteration of the moorshifled, earthified, aggregated, and shrunken fen soil horizons classified by increasing bulk density levels was reflected by the estimated van Genuchten parameters. For horizons inventoried as unchanged peat substrates, less variability of bulk densities in combination with deviating van Genuchten parameters indicated the influence of additional factors on soil hydraulic properties.

AB This article presents the results of a field investigation of saturated hydraulic conductivity Ksat and bulk density (?bd) in an Atlantic blanket bog in the southwest of Ireland. Starting at a peatland stream and moving along an uphill transect toward the peatland interior, ?bd and Ksat were examined at regular intervals. Saturated horizontal hydraulic conductivity (Khsat) and vertical (Kvsat) was estimated at two depths: 1020 and 3040?cm below the peat surface, whereas ?bd was estimated for the full profile. We consider two separate zones, one a riparian zone extending 10?m from the stream and a second zone in the bog interior. We found that the Ksat was higher (similar to 105?m?s1) in the bog interior than that in the riparian zone (similar to 106?m?s1), whereas the converse applied to bulk density, with lowest density (similar to 0.055?g?cm3) at the interior and highest (similar to 0.11?g?cm3) at the riparian zone. In general, we found Khsat to be approximately twice the Kvsat. These results support the idea that the lower Ksat at the margins control the hydrology of blanket peatlands. It is therefore important that the spatial variation of these two key properties be accommodated in hydrological models if the correct rainfall runoff characteristics are to be correctly modelled. Stream flow analysis over 3?years at the peatland catchment outlet showed that the stream runoff was composed of 8% base flow and 92% flood flow, suggesting that this blanket peatland is a source rather than a sink for floodwaters.

AB Warming and thawing in the Arctic are promoting biogeochemical processing and hydrologic transport in carbon-rich permafrost and soils that transfer carbon to surface waters or the atmosphere. Hydrologic and biogeochemical impacts of thawing are challenging to predict with sparse information on arctic soil hydraulic and thermal properties. We developed empirical and statistical models of soil properties for three main strata in the shallow, seasonally thawed soils above permafrost in a study area of similar to 7,500 km(2)in Alaska. The models show that soil vertical stratification and hydraulic properties are predictable based on vegetation cover and slope. We also show that the distinct hydraulic and thermal properties of each soil stratum can be predicted solely from bulk density. These findings fill the gap for a sparsely mapped region of the Arctic and enable regional interpolation of soil properties critical for determining future hydrologic responses and the fate of carbon in thawing permafrost.

AB Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. (Franco)] bark (DFB), sphagnum peatmoss, and pumice are the most common substrate components used in the Oregon nursery industry. The objective of this study was to document the effect of peat and pumice addition on the physical and hydrological properties of DFB soilless substrates. A secondary objective was to determine if measured properties of mixed soilless substrates can be accurately predicted from the known properties of the individual components. Treatment design was a 3 x 3 factorial with three rates each of sphagnum peatmoss and pumice (0%, 15%, and 30% by vol.) added to DFB. The resulting nine substrates were measured for total porosity, air space, container capacity, and bulk density using porometers. Moisture characteristic curves were generated by measuring water content along a continuous column. Adding pumice to DFB decreased total porosity, container capacity, available water, and water-buffering capacity but increased bulk density. Adding peatmoss to DFB increased total porosity, container capacity, and available water but decreased air space and bulk density. Comparison of predicted values against measured values indicated that bulk density could be predicted reliably; however, all other physical properties could not be accurately predicted.

AB The carbon sink function of peatlands is the result of a relatively small imbalance between biomass production and decay and proposed to be sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Thus, peat decomposition plays a decisive role in determining the future carbon balances of peatlands under changing climatic conditions and increasing human pressure. To evaluate the effects of peatland degradation on the degree of decomposition in light of deviating site histories and to reveal interrelations between different indicators, we analysed peat depth profiles of physicochemical peat decomposition proxies across nine study sites in two valley bogs in the Eastern Alps, Austria. For this purpose, we divided 1 m peat cores sampled at the nine sites into 4 cm sections and analysed these peat samples for bulk density, loss on ignition, pH value, carbon and nitrogen content and ratio, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures, and five humification indices based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Besides, we regularly measured water levels and incubated litter bags over two years. Peat characteristics were found to be relatively homogenous across the treeless and only slightly degraded sites. At these sites, depth profiles followed similar patterns with strongly increasing decomposition in the uppermost layers and the highest degree of peat decomposition at 40-56 cm depths for most proxies. Thus, our findings suggest that even apparently only slightly degraded sites were distinctly affected by past drainages. In contrast to the open peat bog sites, the degree in peat decomposition was distinctly higher at tree-encroached sites and at long-term drained former peat-cutting sites. Both, the distinct difference in the degree of decomposition between the two peatlands and the inverse decomposition depth trends, i.e., more decomposed peat overlying less decomposed layers, highlight the importance of secondary decomposition on the depth profiles and the strong effects of site histories on the current degree of peat decomposition. The results of two-year litter bag incubations of four vascular plant species revealed distinct differences in species-specific litter decomposition rates and considerable differences for same species between the two investigated bogs. The strong interrelations between different humification indices underline the simultaneous effects of proceeding decay on the different chemical properties of the peat. Besides, humification indices were strongly related with other physical and chemical properties of peats and highest loadings on the principal component 1 that accounted for 41% of the total variance of the dataset were found for four different humification indices, bulk density and nitrogen contents. We conclude that the selective preservation of aliphatic, acid and aromatic groups during peat decomposition are well suited to elucidate small-scale differences in the degree of decomposition and to strongly interrelate with established indicators as bulk densities.

AB Permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands may be widespread as climate warms over the next century. Thaw will lead to dramatic changes in vegetation, and an understanding of the patterns and rates of succession following thaw is important for assessing future ecosystem changes, such as carbon accumulation and the likelihood of permafrost formation during climate warming. This paper describes the autogenic processes of peat accumulation and succession from recently thawed, aquatic Sphagnum communities to lawn and hummock Sphagnum communities favorable for permafrost formation. Peat cores were used to construct bulk density profiles in aquatic, lawn, and hummock habitats. Soil bulk density increased over time from the edges to the centers of thawed bogs. These changes corresponded to changes from aquatic to lawn/hummock communities. Macrofossils from Pb-210-dated peat cores were used to document historical changes to hummock communities. Succession to hummock communities capable of forming permafrost was less than 80 years. Picea mariana seedlings colonized emergent Sphagnum hummocks in collapse scars, which may lead to permafrost formation. However, permafrost formation in today's discontinuous permafrost landscape is unlikely during future climate warming because of limited tree establishment and shifting mean annual temperature isotherms.

ID MOISTURE; DENSITY
AB The effects of incorporating peat into three Trinidadian agricultural soils before compaction on soil thermal conductivity k was investigated in a laboratory experiment. A factorial experiment was used to study the effect of peat applied at four levels (0%, 4%, 8% and 12% by mass) on maximum thermal conductivity k(max) and the corresponding moisture content on three soils (sandy loam, clay loam and clay) compacted using 5, 15 and 25 Proctor hammer blows. The compaction tests were carried out at different moisture contents ranging from 5% to 55%. Bulk densities achieved during soil compaction were measured to assist in the interpretation of results.
   Results showed that while mean values of k(max) of the soils declined significantly (probabilty P = 0.001) from 1.49 to 1.04 W m(-2) degrees C-1 with increasing peat content, the mean values of the moisture contents at which they occurred increased from 26.1% to 41.7%. While k(max) increased, the corresponding moisture contents decreased with increasing compaction levels. This applied to all soils tested. The clay soil had significantly lower values of thermal conductivities and greater corresponding moisture contents than the clay loam and the sandy loam soils. During soil compaction, thermal conductivity and bulk density behaved in the same manner, except that the maximum bulk density was achieved at lower moisture content than thermal conductivity. There was a significant interaction effect between soil type and peat content on thermal conductivity. There was also a reasonable agreement between the laboratory measured thermal conductivity data and those predicted using the Campbell model. A linear equation developed to relate thermal conductivity to bulk density suggests that a unique relationship may exist between the two parameters, when compacted soils are involved. A multiple linear regression equation was further developed for predicting bulk density from experimental factors. (c) 2006 IAgrE. All rights reserved Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The within-site variability of soil characteristics on sites with different soil types remains poorly quantified, although this information is crucial for the success of research on soil properties, and especially for monitoring soil properties over time. We used coefficients of variation and multilevel variance component models to examine the within-site variation of soil (0-30 cm) mineral nutrient concentrations (P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, mg g(-1); Mn, Zn, mug g(-1)) and bulk density (kg m(-3)) on boreal deep-peat sites. We then evaluated the reliability of the site-level estimates (sample means) obtained using different sampling intensities (numbers of samples per site). Our 11 sites represented a single original site type within the oligotrophic nutrient level. Two of the sites were undrained while the rest had been drained for forestry at different points in time. Overall, P concentrations showed the smallest and Mn concentrations the largest within-site variation. The sampling depth contributed more than 50% of the total variance in all other characteristics except the concentrations of P and Fe, and bulk density. The variance proportions of peatland basin, site (within basin), and sampling location (within site) varied by sampling depth for most soil characteristics. The estimates obtained when using a certain number of samples per site were always more reliable for the 0-30 cm layer's composite samples than for any single 10-cm layer at any depth sampled. On average, it was found that between 4 (P) and some 200 (Mn) samples per site would be needed for the estimates to have a theoretical 10% maximum deviation.

AB Bryophyte growth and production can be critical measurements in quantifying carbon input into peatlands. For any species, total biomass produced in a given year is determined by three main factors: abundance of the species, bulk density, and annual (length) increment. We examined the relationship of these parameters to environmental factors (water table depth, tree canopy cover) and biotic interactions (presence of other species) in seven common peatland bryophytes. Correlations suggest that bulk density changed in response to environmental variation in Sphagnum angustifolium (C.aJens. ex Russ.) C.aJens. in Tolf, Sphagnumafuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr., and Aulacomnium palustre (Hedw.) Schwaegr., and it remained constant in Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt., Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) Schimp. in B.S.G., Tomenthypnum nitens (Hedw.) Loeske, and Hamatocaulis vernicosus (Mitt.) Hedenas. Length increment was dependent on water table depth in S.aangustifolium, P.aschreberi, and Hamatocaulisavernicosus, and changed with canopy cover in H.asplendens at one of two sites examined. Overall, our results suggest that (i) in some species, changes in bulk density are likely to be an important component of changes in productivity in response to environmental variation; (ii) local vigour tends to increase with abundance, but may not do so in all cases; and (iii) phenomena such as biotic interactions and environmental extremes may lead to non-linearity of productivity responses to environmental change.

AB Growth room experiments were conducted to assess the interaction of soil type, biofungicides, soil compaction and pathotype/host on infection and symptom development caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, the cause of clubroot on Brassica spp. In two initial experiments, four soil types (peat soil, mineral soil, non-calcareous sand, soil-less mix), two biofungicides (Bacillus subtilis, Clonostachys rosea), and two pathotypes (3 and 6, Williams' differential set) were assessed. Differences in clubroot severity associated with soil type were unexpectedly small and variable. Prestop (C. rosea) was often more effective than Serenade (B. subtilis) at reducing clubroot levels on peat and mineral soils, but less effective than Serenade on sand. Inoculation with pathotype 3 often resulted in a slightly higher mean severity than pathotype 6. The interaction of soil type 9 biofungicide was similar on both canola (B. napus) and Shanghai pak choy (B. rapa subsp. chinensis), whether the soil was kept saturated or allowed to drain after inoculation. The impact of soil type on biofungicide efficacy might explain, in part, why biofungicides are more effective in one location than another. The observation that clubroot severity in soil-less mix was affected by compaction led to an investigation of soil bulk density. Severity was higher in soil-less mix that was more compacted than in the initial experiments, and was lower in peat and mineral soils when soil bulk density was reduced by adding soil-less mix. In this study, soil bulk density had a larger impact on clubroot than soil type, organic matter or pathotype.

AB Dry bulk density, penetration resistance, and shear strength were measured in the laboratory for two Trinidadian soils (sandy loam and clay) mixed with peat and farmyard manure (FYM) at four levels (0, 4, 8, and 12% by mass) after they had been compacted using 5, 15, and 25 standard Proctor blows. The compaction was carried out at different moisture contents determined according to the consistency limits of the soils. Values of bulk density, penetration resistance and shear strength of the soils increased with increments in moisture content up to peak values after which the values decreased with further increments in moisture content. Generally, organic matter reduced these peak values for all the soils at all compaction levels, with peat producing lower peak values than FYM. There were significant interaction effects between level of added organic matter and type of organic material, between soil compaction level and type of organic material and between compaction level and soil type. These interactions were used to describe the effect of peat and FYM on peak penetration resistance and peak shear strength. Values of bulk density decreased with increasing organic matter contents at most levels of moisture content in all the soils. Values of penetration resistance and shear strength decreased with increasing organic matter contents at lower levels of moisture content while the reverse occurred at higher moisture levels. Regression models were used to describe these trends in results. Results from this study demonstrate that the effect of organic matter on the strength properties of compacted agricultural soils depends on the level of soil moisture at compaction and the type of organic material.

ID MISCANTHUS; STAND
AB In order to test the suitability of Phragmites australis as base material for lightweight concrete, reed straw was harvested from the protected mire area of the National Park Narew, NE Poland. In March 2004, plant material was collected along a transect extending from the margin of valley, across the floodplain up to the river. Studies on morphological properties like shoot length, shoot diameter, number of nodes, thickness of sclerenchyma rings and technical properties like bulk density, absorbing and binding of water were performed to elucidate the basics of the pressure stability (N mm(-2)) of concrete probes.
   Our results revealed that Phragmites growing far from the watercourse are characterised by low bulk density, better water characteristics and consequently higher pressure stability of concrete, reaching up to 0.5 N mm(-2). Phragmites growing close to the riverbank revealed significantly higher bulk density (over 100 kg m(-3)), worse water features and as a consequence lower pressure stability of the concrete. The good parameters of obtained lightweight concrete blocs along with the rising industrial demand for cost effective, lightweight and robust insulating materials allow us to predict, that Phragmites has a great potential as feedstock for building materials.

AB Coal gasification slag is a by-product of the power industry that may prove useful to the horticultural industry as a component of growing media. The objectives of this research are to determine if suitable crops of chrysanthemum and poinsettia can be produced in media of slag alone or in combination with moss peat. Chrysanthemums and poinsettias were grown in slag or slag mixes in an ebb and flow irrigation system with a complete nutrient solution being recycled. Slag alone had a high bulk density and high pH, but adding 50% by volume peat decreased bulk density and pH so that an acceptable growing mix resulted. Weight of plant shoots grown in slag was lower than for plants that were grown in slag mixes. Weight of plants in slag mixes was similar to the peat-perlite control. Plants grown in slag or slag mixes generally were low in phosphorus (P) and manganese (Mn) and high in boron (B). The slag mixes seem to remove P and Mn from the fertilizer solution while releasing B and to some extent calcium (Ca) to the fertilizer solution.

ID MOISTURE; DENSITY
AB Thermal conductivity and diffusivity were measured in the field and the laboratory with a portable thermal properties sensor and probe (KD2, Decagon Devices, Inc.) for twelve major agricultural soils in Trinidad. These parameters were measured because they are required for the design of underground cables and for agronomic practice. The effect of incorporating peat into four of the agricultural soils on thermal conductivity and diffusivity was further investigated over a range of stresses from 0 to 1000 kPa using a compression machine. Air-dry peat was applied at four levels (0%, 4%, 8%, and 12% by mass) to the four soils (two sandy loams, a clay loam, and clay) and tested at three moisture contents by mass, namely, 5% below Proctor optimum for maximum compaction, optimum, and 5% above optimum. Bulk densities achieved during soil compression were computed to assist in the interpretation of the results. The thermal conductivity measured in the field ranged from 0.90 to 1.55 W m(-1) degrees C-1 and were within 0.1 W m(-1) degrees C-1 of the values measured in the laboratory for the individual soils. Mean thermal conductivity during laboratory measurements declined significantly from 1.21 to 0.97 W m(-1) degrees C-1, and mean thermal diffusivity declined from 0.25 to 0.19 mm(2) s(-1) as the peat content increased from 0% to 12% by mass. Mean thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increased significantly with increasing applied stress and moisture level at the 0.001 level and declined, in most cases, with increasing clay content. The effect of peat incorporation in decreasing soil thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity is diminished at low soil moisture and bulk density. Thermal conductivity, and diffusivity were significantly (p = 0.001) and linearly related to each other Two significant (p = 0.001) linear equations developed to relate each thermal property to bulk density suggest that unique relationships may exist between the two thermal properties and bulk density A multiple linear regression equation was further developed from the experimental data to be utilized as a first estimation of bulk density. The results from this study contribute to the greater understanding of how peat affects thermal conductivity and diffusivity

AB The calibration of time domain reflectometry, previously established for an organic soil of 0.422 Mg.m-3 bulk density, was established for peat blocks with bulk densities ranging from 0.06 to 0.25 Mg.m-3. An empirical relationship between the volumetric water content and the measured apparent dielectric constant was established in the laboratory. This relationship can be used to estimate volumetric water content between 0.21 and 0.95 cm3.cm-3 with a standard deviation of 0.03 cm3.cm-3. The large variations observed during the calibration were mainly attributed to the size and heterogeneousness of peat samples. When water tables in the field were high, standard deviation decreased to 0.02 cm3.cm-3, which agrees very well with other time domain reflectometry experiments.

SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS

DT Article
AB Cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) historically have been established on peat based soils and, in most cases, are treated every three to five years with a 1-4 cm layer of sand. A total of 46 soil samples from cranberry bogs in five states [Massachusetts (MA), New Jersey (NJ), Oregon (OR), Washington (WA), and Wisconsin (WI)] and one Canadian province [British Columbia (BC)] were collected and analyzed for bulk density, particle density, and percent organic carbon to assess the range of these characteristics which have resulted from management practices. Soil bulk densities ranged from 0.16 to 1.40 Mg/m3, particle densities from 0.71 to 2.45 Mg/m3, and organic carbon from 1.3 to 95. 2%. The wide ranges reflect the differences between non-sanded and regularly sanded bogs. The low end of density and high end of organic C were found in the non-sanded bogs, which were located in WA and BC. The bogs from the other areas had higher average bulk and particle density levels, approximately 1 and 1.7 Mg/m3, respectively. content. Soil bulk density was generally highest for NT at planting, however, the bulk density for CP and MP increased later in the season attaining values comparable to those of NT treatment. Chiseling and moldboard plowing reduced soil aggregate stability. Soil temperature at planting was lower for no-tillage compared to the moldboard plowed system. Effects of tillage on pore size distribution, for the first two years of the experiment, were significant only at planting. Total porosity was higher for MP than CP and NT in both years. At midseason, 1991, total porosity was lower with MP than with NT and CP. The improved NT crop performance relative to the CP and MP treatments could also be related to better seed bed and root bed conditions following soybean (third year) than sod (first year) and better weed control. Initial crop yield advantages of MP over the conservation tillage systems (NT and CP) deteriorated over time, resulting in decreased soil aggregation, total porosity and soil productivity.

AB The slow-moving flameless burning of wildland fuels (i.e. smouldering) can be difficult to detect and challenging to extinguish. Although previous research involving the smouldering of organic fuels (e.g. cotton, cellulose, peat) has investigated the influence of various fuel characteristics (e.g. moisture content, inorganic content, bulk density) on spread rate and surface temperatures, the smouldering behaviour of other common fuels is not well understood. This study expands on previous research to better understand how fuel characteristics influence the smouldering behaviour of duff from coniferous forests. Specifically, horizontal spread rates (0.5-19.5 cm h(-1)) and ground surface temperatures (258-392 degrees C) were measured on 52 duff samples collected from underneath mature ponderosa pine trees (Pinus ponderosa) from sites in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and evaluated in terms of their moisture content (6-113%), inorganic content (3-42%), bulk density (34-130 kg m(-3)) and fuel depth (3.8-16.3 cm). The data suggested that horizontal spread rates decrease when inorganic content, inorganic loading and/or moisture loading of the duff increases. Surface temperatures decrease when inorganic bulk density and/or fuel loading increases. Conversely, surface temperatures decrease when moisture content increases for shallow duff. Higher fuel loading increases the likelihood of smouldering below the surface.

AB Soil compaction is an often-recorded characteristic of degraded soils, and-along with soil seating and contamination-frequently found in urban habitats. Knowledge about the impact of soil degradation on the ecosystem functioning in urban environments is limited, although urbanization is the major ongoing land use change worldwide. Since urban soils are a potential habitat for soil animals, and burrowing soil fauna exerts a profound impact on the structure and functioning of soils, we studied the impact of increased bulk densities on the ability of Enchytraeus albidus (Enchytraeidae: Oligochaeta) to penetrate compacted soils. Moreover, it was our aim to characterize the influence of the worms on the mobilization of nutrients in urban soils. E. albidus was able to enter compacted sandy loamy soil. columns with a bulk density of up to approx. 1.4 g cm(-3), but only up to approx. 1.0 g cm(-3) in pure sandy soil columns. Soil. compaction increased the amounts of water-extractable sodium (7.5%) and magnesium (13.4%) compared to the non-compacted soil. Presence of E. albidus in the non-compacted soil resulted in higher water-extractabte concentrations of sodium (17.4%), potassium (16.8%), calcium (11.3%), magnesium (13.2%), dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 14.5%) and nitrate (20.4%) in soil, extracts. In the compacted soil, however, the enhanced nutrient availability due to the activity of the enchytraeids was less pronounced than in the non-compacted soil. Although the concentrations of DOC (13.5%), nitrate (15.6%), calcium (5.8%) and magnesium (4.0%) were significantly higher in the presence of E. albidus than in the columns without animals, the performance of the animals was partly impaired. This was most likely due to the higher penetration resistance of the compacted soils. The degree of compaction investigated in this study was relatively low-chosen to allow for the colonization of the soils by E. albidus. We conclude that the observed negative effects of increased bulk densities on the activity of soil enchytraeids can occur in any more frequented city park, thereby decreasing turnover rates and the supply of soil nutrients in urban ecosystems.

ID AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY
AB Quantification of the effects of organic carbon (OC) addition to reclaimed soils is an important reclamation issue. Such effects on soil texture, field capacity (FC), wilting point (PWP) and water-holding capacity (WHC), all expressed both on a gravimetric and volumetric basis, were quantified using both in situ soil samples and laboratory-prepared peat:mineral mixes. Soil samples were collected from both natural and reclaimed areas within the Oil Sands region of Alberta; pear was obtained from the same area. Organic carbon was determined for laboratory-created mixtures and expressed as volume ratios; for the in situ samples it was expressed as % OC. Bulk density, an important factor in the effects of OC on water retention, was measured in situ.
   Water retention parameters of in situ samples on a gravimetric basis were significantly related to % OC, but those on a volume basis were not. Trends in volumetric WHC for in situ, coarse-textured samples were similar to those for gravimeteric WHC, due to similar bulk densities ranging from 1.30 to 1.40 Mg m(-3). However, for in situ peaty soils, trends in volumetric water retention did not mimic those expressed on a gravimetric basis due to low and irregular bulk densities. For laboratory-constructed peat:mineral mixes, FC and WHC were significantly impacted by % OC, however, PWP was not.
   The addition of peat material resulted in minor textural changes for sand and loamy sand; hence, the change in texture could not be responsible for the increases in WHC as the result of peat additions. The results for sandy loam were variable.

AB Maximum dry bulk density (MDBD) and the corresponding critical moisture content (CMC) were measured in the laboratory for two Trinidadian soils (sandy loam and clay) mixed with three organic materials [peat, farm yard manure (FYM), and filter press mud (FPM)] each at four levels (0, 4, 8, 12% by mass) and compacted using 5, 15, and 25 standard Proctor hammer blows. The compaction tests on the soils were carried out at different moisture contents determined according to the consistency limits of the soils. While the mean MDBD declined significantly (P < 0.001) from 1.51 to 1.26 Mg m(-3), the mean CMC increased from 23.2 to 32.9% as added organic materials increased from 0 to 12%. While the former increased, the CMC decreased with increasing compaction efforts. The effectiveness of the organic materials in terms of reducing MDBD and increasing CMC was in decreasing order: peat, FYM, and FPM. Clay soil achieved lower values of MDBD at higher corresponding CMC than the sandy loam. The significant interaction effects observed between some of the experimental factors were used to describe the effect of incorporation of organic materials on soil compaction. Prediction equations for MDBD and CMC were derived for each of the organic materials and all of them combined.

AB Different agro-industrial wastes were mixed with different plasticizers and extruded to form the pellets to be used further for development of biodegradable molded pots. Bulk density and macro-porosity are the important engineering properties used to determine the functional characteristics of the biodegradable pellets viz., expansion volume, water solubility, product colour, flowability and compactness. Significant differences in the functional properties of pellets with varying bulk densities (loose and tapped) and macro-porosities (loose, tapped) were observed. The observed mean bulk density of biodegradable pellets made from different formulations ranged between 0.213 and 0.560 g/ml for loose fill conditions and 0.248 to 0.604 g/ml for tapped fill conditions. Biodegradable pellets bear a good compaction for both loose and tapped fill methods. The mean macro-porosity of biodegradable pellets ranged between 1.19 and 54.48 % for loose fill condition and 0.29 to 53.35 % for tapped fill condition. Hausner ratio (HR) for biodegradable pellets varied from 1.026 to 1.328, indicating a good flowability of biodegradable pellets. Pearson's correlation between engineering properties and functional properties of biodegradable pellets revealed that from engineering properties functional properties can be predicted.

AB Within peatland ecosystems, small deviations in surface elevation result in microforms that differ in depth to water table, plant type and rate of biogeochemical cycling, possibly leading to differences in peat physical and hydrological properties that could feed back to the whole ecosystem hydrological and biogeochemical function. However, hydrological parameters for peatland microforms have not been quantified. This study determined bulk density, pore size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) at hummocks and hollows of four, Sphagnum-dominated Canadian peatlands. Study sites included both a bog and poor fen in each of Alberta and Quebec allowing for investigation of differences in peat hydrophysical properties between microforms across a range of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. Hydraulic conductivity was determined in the laboratory on peat from the surface (0.03-0.08 m) and the saturated zone (0.20 m below the local water table position). Peatland type, climate region, microform and depth of peat were all significant descriptors of variation in K-sat. Deeper peat was less conductive than surface peat. Hummocks generally had higher K-sat than hollows at both surface and saturated zones, although differences between microforms varied between sites. Differences in K-sat between samples were correlated with bulk density, von Post humification and macroporosity. These results indicate that there are microtopographical differences in peat hydrophysical properties; however, the strong decline in K-sat with depth indicates that differences in the local water table, resulting in a change in depth of water flow, is likely a stronger control on local K-sat than microform type.

AB The Florida Everglades is a patterned peatland formed from sawgrass and other aquatic plant material that has accumulated over millennia. This peatland was initially drained in the late 1800s for agricultural and urban development and has been highly modified by the construction of canals and levees. Restoration plans include providing additional surface water flow which should help to prevent further peat loss by oxidation and encourage the accretion of peat that has been lost through drainage and peat fires. But how much peat has been lost? We know that about 50 % of the original surface area is gone; but what about the driver of ecological processes, the soil? Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, we compared predrainage and current peat volumes using historical and recent datasets, spatially-referenced soil bulk density values and carbon content to determine peat mass and carbon mass for each Everglades region. Given the uncertainties in the datasets, this analysis should be viewed as providing rough order-of-magnitude values. Our calculations indicate that the current Everglades contains less than 24 % of the original peat volume, 17 % of its mass and 19 % of its carbon.

AB The estimates ambiguity of the consequences of both mires drainage and restoration in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and the rate of modern peat accumulation, potential fire hazard, and biodiversity dynamics makes it necessary to conduct research on the current state and trends of self-recovery of biosphere functions of drained raised bogs in the southern taiga subzone of West Siberia. The goal of this work is to assess the intensity of peat accumulation and the degree of transformation of peat deposits within the drained raised bogs the South-Eastern part of West Siberia based on the analysis of the physical properties and botanical composition of peat.
   The objects under study are 8 key sites in drained and similar natural pine-shrub-sphagnum raised bog. The species composition is characterized by the dominance of Pinus sylvestris, Ledum palustre, Chamaedaphne calculata and sphagnum mosses. The area under study were drained in 1980 by a network of open channels for the purpose of forest melioration and peat extraction. The lack of planting and repair of the drainage network has led to the development of self-recovery processes in drained mires.
   Field studies of the sites included the access of peat deposit depths, selecting stratigraphic layer by type and degree of decomposition of peat by visual method; sampling peat in steps of 5 cm to a depth of 90 cm using a Russian peat corer. Laboratory analysis of peat included determination of the following characteristics: Botanical composition, degree of decomposition, ash content, water content, bulk density. We take analyzed a total of 162 peat samples. The significance of differences in the physical properties of peat in drained and natural bogs was assessed using the Mann-Whitney test (U-test). Classification of sites by criteria of physical properties of peat was performed by cluster analysis.
   The consequences of drainage are manifested in a change in the species composition of mosses and an increase in the proportion of wood residues in the peat deposit upper layer. On two sites, the change of balticum and magellanicum peat to fuscum peat at a depth of 25 cm was noted. The other site is characterized by the appearance of upper layer of green mosses in the peat composition with a maximum share of their presence at a depth of 15-20 cm. Two sites are characterized by the formation of wood peat in the upper layer, with almost complete absence of sphagnum moss residues here, which can be an indicator of the almost complete absence of the process of peat deposits modern accumulation.
   As a result of the study, it is shown that the bulk density of peat characterizes the rate of accumulation of peat and is directly related to the ash content and the degree of decomposition. The increase in density in the peat layer at depths up to 25 cm corresponds to the period of peat accumulation during the maximum effect of drainage. The change in ash content with depth and a maximum value in the layer of 15-35 cm is an indicator of the transformation of the peat layer located on the surface during the first years after drainage, and is generally consistent with the laws of bulk density changes in depth.
   According to the results of the study, it was found that the peat layer formed after drainage reclamation changes from 0 to 25-30 cm in different key sites. In 6 of the 8 studied sites, the process of modern peat accumulation is observed; in two sites, the rate of peat accumulation is minimal or completely absent.

TI Implications of short-range spatial variation of soil bulk density for
   adequate field-sampling protocols: methodology and results from two
   contrasting soils
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Soil bulk density (BD) is measured during soil monitoring. Because it is spatially variable, an appropriate sampling protocol is required. This paper shows how information on short-range variability can be used to quantify uncertainty of estimates of mean BD and soil organic carbon on a volumetric basis (SOCv) at a sampling site with different sampling intensities. We report results from two contrasting study areas, with mineral soil and with peat. More sites should be investigated to develop robust protocols for national-scale monitoring, but these results illustrate the methodology. A 20 x 20-m(2) monitoring site was considered and sampling protocols were evaluated under geostatistical models of our two study areas. At sites with local soil variability comparable to our mineral soil, sampling at 16 points (4 x 4 square grid of interval 5 m) would achieve a root mean square error (RMSE) of the sample mean value of both BD and SOCv of less than 5% of the mean (topsoil and subsoil). Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) gave predictions of mean soil BD at a sample site, comparable to our study area on mineral soil, with similar precision to a single direct measurement of BD. On peat soils comparable to our second study area, the mean BD for the monitoring site at depth 0-50 cm would be estimated with RMSE to be less than 5% of the mean with a sample of 16 cores, but at greater depths this criterion cannot be achieved with 25 cores or fewer.

AB Bulk density, degree of humification, % moisture content and the % occurrence of plant macrofossils were determined down a single peat core. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to obtain spectra for each sample and calibration equations were developed between the conventional analyses and the NIRS spectra using modified partial least squares and stepwise regressions. Conventional analyses were then correlated with values predicted from these equations, with regression coefficients ranging from 0.98 for degree of humification to 0.85 for Ericales roots. An attempt was also made to determine the minimum number of samples required to produce a useful calibration for each variable. Where successful, this ranged from one sixth to one third of the available samples and in each case represented a significant potential for time-saving. NIRS is a potentially valuable technique in palaeoecological studies of pest, enabling the nondestructive analysis of large numbers of samples.

AB Accurate prediction of rut depth caused by military vehicles trafficking is crucial for the success of their mission. In addition to the operational aspect of trafficability and mobility, military vehicle traffic can lead to severe degradation of soil functions. The objective of this study was (i) to examine rut depth formation and bulk density changes after one and repeated passages of a military vehicle on different soils and land uses, and (ii) to assess the ability of an analytical soil compaction model to predict these changes. The wheeling tests were carried out with a 7 Mg military truck at seven sites in Estonia covering soil textures from sand to clay and a peat soil. Rut depths and bulk density at various depths were measured after one and ten vehicle passes. Undisturbed soil samples were collected next to the tracks for determination of initial soil compressive properties used for parameterisation of the model. The smallest rut depths were measured on arable soils, both after one and ten vehicle passes. The largest rut depth after one pass was obtained on the peat soil, while the largest rut depths after ten passes were measured on the grassland soils. The model overestimated rut depths on the peat soil, and underestimated the increase in rut depth from the first to the tenth pass on the grassland soils, while predictions for the arable soils were adequate. We identify a need for studies on the mechanical behaviour of peat soils during wheeling and for better quantitative description of multi pass effects, especially on soft soils.

AB Ten substrates were formulated by blending perlite or parboiled fresh rice hulls (PBH) to produce root substrates (substrates) that contained either 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or 60% (by volume) perlite or PBH, with the remainder being sphagnum. peatmoss. All substrates containing PBH had higher total pore space than substrates containing an equivalent amount of perlite. As the percentage perlite increased from 20% to 60%, the total pore space decreased. The total pore space increased as the amount of PBH increased to 50% and then decreased as the amount of PBH increased from 50% to 60%. The air-filled pore space was not different between substrates containing 20% perlite or PBH. However, the air-filled pore space was higher in PBH-containing substrates than in equivalent perlite-containing substrates when the amount of PBH or perlite was at least 40%. As the amount of perlite or PBH was increased, the air-filled pore space increased, but the rate of increase was higher for PBH-containing substrates. The 20% PBH-containing substrate had a higher water-holding capacity than the 20% perlite-containing substrate. However, at 30% or higher PBH, the PBH-containing root substrates had a lower water-holding capacity than equivalent perlite-containing substrates. As the percentage perlite or PBH was increased, the water-holding capacity decreased, but at a higher rate in PBH-containing substrates than in perlite-containing substrates. For all substrates except those containing 40% PBH or perlite, substrates containing PBH had lower bulk densities than equivalent perlite-containing substrates. The differences in bulk densities were not great enough to be of practical significance. Inclusion of PBH in the substrate provided for drainage and air-filled pore space as did perlite. However, less PBH would be required in a substrate to provide the same air-filled pore space as perlite when more than 20% perlite or PBH is used.

AB The change in soil carbon (C) stock over a 19-31-year period (mean 25years) has been measured at 179 sites on a 20-km grid across Scotland. Sampling was by horizon from a profile pit. Although soil bulk density determinations were absent at the first sampling time, we used bulk density values from the second sampling time calibrated against NIR spectra to predict the missing values. There was no detectable change in overall total soil C stock (mean +/- standard error, to a depth of 100cm), which was 266 +/- 15 and 270 +/- 15tCha(-1) for the first and second sampling times, respectively, or generally in C stock within specific vegetation or soil types. The exception was for soils under woodland, excluding those on deep peat, which exhibited a significant (P=0.05) gain of 1.0tCha(-1)year(-1). Soils under woodland (mainly coniferous plantation) also showed a significant (P=0.04) increase in C content (gkg(-1)), a significant decrease in bulk density (P=0.006) and an increase in the thickness of the Litter-Fermentation-Humus (LFH) layer (P=0.06). Recalculating the C stock to a depth of 15cm showed a significant increase in overall C stock (when deep peat sites were excluded) as well as specifically in moorland and woodland soils, suggesting that had we sampled only to 15cm, we would have reached a different conclusion. Both improved grassland soils and those initially under arable cultivation showed a significant decrease in C content. However, the mean thickness of Ap horizons increased from 29 to 32cm, with a concomitant decrease in C content and a slight increase in bulk density; this we ascribe to deeper ploughing between the sample periods. In the context of possible soil C losses, we can be 95% confident that the mean loss does not exceed 0.2%year(-1) and 99% confident that it does not exceed 0.4%year(-1).

ID BALANCE; SOILS
AB Peat-forming organic soils lose large amounts of carbon and soil volume when drained. Although surface subsidence is often taken as a proxy for the associated carbon loss, other mechanisms also cause a change in volume. To infer the reliability of subsidence for estimating carbon loss, we compared long-term subsidence rates of an 80 ha area of temperate fen that was drained 140 yr ago against estimates of subsidence based on soil bulk densities measured at four sites. Both methods correlate significantly, yield similar subsidence rates of 0.8-1.6 cm/yr and underpin the value of using profile information for inferring volumetric loss. Peat oxidation accounts for 28-64% of the loss in volume, which is equivalent to annual carbon loss rates of 2.5-5.5 t C/ha. Whereas the profile-based method is also suitable for estimating carbon loss, the wide range of oxidative contribution to the overall subsidence indicates that subsidence alone cannot provide an unbiased estimate of carbon emission factors from drained fens.

AB Russia's West Siberian Lowland (WSL) contains the most extensive peatlands on Earth with many underlain by permafrost. We present a new database of 12 705 measurements of vertical water content and bulk soil properties from 98 permafrost and non-permafrost cores collected in raised bogs and peat plateaus across the region, together with in-situ measurements of surface moisture and thaw depth, botanical descriptions of dominant surface vegetation species assemblage, and field notes. Data analyses reveal significant contrasts (p?<?0.01 to p?<?0.0001) between permafrost and non-permafrost sites. On average, permafrost WSL peatlands exhibit drier surfaces, shallower depth, lower organic matter content and higher bulk density than do non-permafrost sites. Peat bulk density and ash-free density increase with depth for non-permafrost but not for permafrost sites. Gravimetric water content averages 92.0% near the surface and 89.3% at depth in non-permafrost, but 81.6% and 85.4%, respectively, in permafrost, suggesting that the disappearance of permafrost could produce moister surfaces across the WSL. GIS extrapolation of these results suggests that WSL peatlands may contain 1200?km3 of water and ice, a large storage equivalent to 2-m average liquid water depth and approximately three times the total annual flow in the Ob' River. A global estimate of 6900-km3 subsurface water storage for all northern peatlands suggests a volume comparable to or greater than the total water storage in northern lakes.

AB The drainage of low-lying peatland for agriculture and subsequent conservation measures adopted on some of these peatlands has led to differing degrees of change in the physical and hydraulic characteristics of the soil. We assessed the degree of peat decomposition and measured the soil organic matter (SOM) content, particle density, dry bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and water retention and shrinkage characteristics for a range of peat soil horizons sampled in two low-lying agricultural peatland in England. The physical and hydraulic properties of the peats considered were significantly influenced by the degree of decomposition. Higher decomposition resulted in lower SOM content, higher bulk density and lower porosity. In addition, pedogenic alterations due to intensive drainage and land use lead to a greater degradation of the soil structure in the upper soil layers. Less decomposed peats had a higher propensity to shrink under increasing water potentials. They had a lower air entry pressure and drained faster than degraded peats. In addition, they had a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity. This shows that decomposition and pedogenic alterations lead to the loss of structural pores. Hence decomposition and humification result in the degradation of the soil structure and a reduction in the soil capacity to store, retain and transmit water. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study aimed to determine moisture thresholds for combustion of organic soils sampled from various vegetation types at 63 locations in Tasmania, Australia. To observe whether the soil sample sustained smouldering combustion, moisture content was experimentally manipulated and heat was applied. Combustion was primarily determined by moisture content, but was also influenced by soil bulk density and organic content: the gravimetric moisture content corresponding to a 50% probability of burning ranged from 25 to 94% as organic content varied from 34 to 96%. There was no evidence of differences among vegetation types in the relationship between soil combustibility and organic content. Combustion in Tasmanian organic soils occurred with moisture levels similar to those reported elsewhere, despite differences in vegetation and environment. It was also found that a hand-held meter that measured volumetric moisture content using time domain reflectometry could be used to satisfactorily predict organic soil combustion. Finally, combining the data with estimates of volumetric soil moisture based on high-resolution gridded weather data (Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia, or BARRA), it was demonstrated that most Tasmanian organic soils are likely to be combustible at some time almost every summer (December to February).

AB This study evaluates the applicability of ground penetrating radar (GPR) as a technique for determining the thickness and internal structure of four peat deposits on Terceira Island (Azores archipelago, mid-Atlantic region). The peatlands studied are all Sphagnum mires located above 500 m a.s.l., but they differ hydrogenetically and in their degree of naturalness. Radargrams for all four bogs, obtained using both 100 MHz and 500 MHz GPR antennae, are presented and compared. The radargram data were validated against peat characteristics (bulk density, von Post H, US method) obtained by direct sampling ('open cores') across the whole peat profile at each site. A scheme of 'soft scoring' for degree of naturalness (DN) of the peatland was developed and used as an additional validation factor. The GPR data were positively correlated with DN, and relationships between GPR data, peat bulk density and degree of humification (H) were also found. From the radargrams it was possible to distinguish the interface between the peat and the mineral substratum as well as some of the internal structure of the peat deposit, and thus to derive the total thickness of the peat deposit and (in some cases) the thicknesses of its constituent layers. The first evaluation of the propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves in Azorean peat yielded a value of 0.04 m ns(-1) for 100 MHz and 500 MHz radar antennae. For one of the study sites, the GPR data were analysed using GIS software to produce tridimensional models and thus to estimate the volumes of peat layers. This type of analysis has potential utility for quantifying some of the ecosystem services provided by peatlands.

   SEQUESTRATION; MANAGEMENT; SUBSOILS; NITROGEN; TEXTURE
AB Estimates on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) stocks in soils cannot be directly calculated from routine soil analyses, since these often lack measurements on soil bulk density (B-d). Hence, flexible pedotransfer functions are required that allow the calculation of SOC stocks from gravimetrically determined SOC contents. The present paper aimed to: (1) quantify SOC and N stocks in grassland topsoils for a Northern Dutch region dominated by dairy farming and (2) analyse the relationships between SOC and bulk density at the field level. As estimates of SOC and N stocks are potentially affected by soil compaction, the combined measurements on soil bulk density and soil organic matter (SOM) were also evaluated with respect to critical limits for soil compaction using soil density (S-d) for sandy soils and packing density (P-d) for clay soils. The SOC and B-d measurements were done in the upper 0.1-0.2 m of grasslands at 18 dairy farms, distributed across sandy, clay and peat soils. Both farm data and grassland management data were collected. Non-linear regressions were used to analyse relationships between B-d and SOM. Significant non-linear relationships were found between gravimetric SOC contents and bulk density for the 0-0.1 m layer (R-2 = 0.80) and the 0.1-0.2m layer (R-2 = 0.86). None of the fields on sandy soils or clay soils indicated signs for limited rooting in the topsoil although some fields appear to approach the critical limit for compaction for the 0.1-0.2m layer. Stocks of SOC in the top 0.2 m at farm level were highest in the peat soils (21.7 kg/m(2)) and lowest in the sandy soils (9.0 kg/m(2)). Similarly, N stocks were highest for farms on peat soil (1.30 kg/m(2)) and lowest for farms on sandy soil (0.60 kg/m(2)). For the sandy soils, the mean SOC stock was significantly higher in fields with shallow groundwater tables.

AB The spatial variability of soil properties plays an important role in water and carbon cycles in peatlands. The objectives of this study were to analyze the spatial variation of hydro-physical properties of peat soils and to establish pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to estimate the hydraulic properties of peat using readily available soil properties. We selected three study sites, each representing a different state of peat degradation (natural, degraded and extremely degraded). At each site, 72 undisturbed soil cores were collected from 5 m by 5 m grid cells in an area of 35 m by 40 m. The saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil water retention curves, total porosity, macroporosity (pore diameter >30 mu m), bulk density and soil organic matter content (SOM) were determined for all sampling locations. The Van Genuchten (VG) model parameters (theta(s), alpha, and n) were optimized using the RETC software package. A strong positive correlation between macroporosity and Ks was observed irrespective of the degradation stage of the peat. However, the relationships between macroporosity and Ks differed between the natural and the drained peatlands. Adding macroporosity to the PTFs substantially improves the prediction of K-s as well as VG parameters. Results show that the soil physical and hydraulic properties (e.g. K-s and VG model parameters) exhibit different levels of spatial heterogeneity depending on the peat degradation stage. The geostatistical analysis suggests that the spatial dependence of soil hydro-physical properties varies depending on the considered property as well as land management (e.g. drainage). Bulk density and SOM are spatially dependent, whereas K-s and macroporosity are spatially independent if the peat is severely degraded. In conclusion, the peat degradation stage plays an important role and should be generally considered in the spatial analysis of peatlands. The obtained semivariograms may serve as a basis for 2D and 3D hydrological modelling as well as peatland restoration studies.

AB The paper deals with the study upon changes within the physical and water properties of murshic endofibric histosols in the drainage meadow object Suprasl Dolna. The scope of studies includes the description of the soil profiles, thickness of diagnostic layer, bulk density, full water capacity, porosity, ash content, and peat decomposition. The long-term investigation carried out in 1982-2015 allows for observing the changes within these soils. The changes were studied in two habitats: wet and dry. In wet habitat, the groundwater flowed 30-98 cm below land surface and supplied the rhizosphere zone. Dynamics of groundwater surface were dependent on the size of precipitation during vegetation period and peat decomposition degree within the soil profile. In the dry habitat, the level of groundwater decreased up to 110 cm (below peat layer). Adverse water conditions in the dry habitat (temporal and long-term water deficiency) caused the increase in bulk density to 0.405 g.cm(-3); simultaneously, a decrease in full water capacity to 82.5%, as well as faster peat mineralization occurred. In wet habitat, physical and water properties of murshic endofibric histosols were not significantly altered. In order to inhibit the peat decomposition rate and delay the peatland degradation, optimum moisture content should be maintained within the soil profile along with rational meadow management.

AB Throughout the world many extensive wetlands, such as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California (hereafter, the Delta), have been drained for agriculture, resulting ill land-surface subsidence of peat soils. The purpose of this project was to study the in situ effects of wetland drainage oil the remaining peat in the Delta. Peat cores were retrieved from four drained, farmed islands and four relatively undisturbed, marsh islands. Core samples were analyzed for bulk density and percent organic Carbon. Macrofossils ill the peat were dated using radiocarbon age determination. The peat from the Canned islands is highly distinct from marsh island peat. Bulk density of peat From the farmed islands is generally greater than that of the marsh islands at a given organic carbon content. Oil the farmed islands. increased bulk density, which is, an indication of compaction, decreases with depth within the unoxidized peat zone, whereas, oil the marsh islands, bulk density is generally constant with depth except near the surface. Approximately 55-80% of the original peat layer oil the farmed islands has been lost due to land-surface subsidence. For the center regions of the farmed islands, this translates into an estimated loss of between 2900-5700 metric tons of organic carbon/hectare. most of the intact peal just below the currently farmed soil layer is over 4000 years old. Peat loss Will continue as long as the artificial water table oil the farmed islands is held below the land surface.

AB Cultivation of seedlings in trays requires the use of specifically developed substrates. This study presents the results of the analyses of selected physical and mechanical parameters of a peat-perlite substrate, in which seedlings of the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) were grown during a production season. For each species, the substrate parameters changed throughout the production season, substrate dry weight decreased, whereas its compactness increased with time. Independent of the species, the bulk density and total porosity of the substrate changed or deviated from the optimum range, although the values of porosity were close to maximum and those of density were close to the minimum. In certain periods in the V265 trays with beech and oak seedlings, the substrate was characterized by very low water capacity and excessive air capacity. Compactness measured with a cone penetrometer showed, that this parameter might be used for monitoring the substrate properties.

AB Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) release from peatlands are closely related to water management and soil degradation. However, peat degradation has not been explicitly accounted for when estimating national greenhouse gas inventories. Here, we assembled a comprehensive dataset covering European, Russian and Canadian peatlands and introduced soil bulk density (BD) as a proxy for peat degradation to estimate nitrous oxide (N2O) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release. The results show that physical and biogeochemical properties of peat are sensitive to soil degradation. The BD is superior to other parameters (C/N, pH) to estimate annual N2O emissions and DOC pore water concentrations. The more a peat soil is degraded, the higher the risk of air/water pollution in peaty landscapes. Even after rewetting, highly degraded soils may exhibit high N2O release rates. The estimated annual N2O-N emissions from European, Russian and Canadian degraded peatlands sum up to approximately 81.0 Gg. The derived BD-based functions can assist in computing global matter fluxes from peatlands.

AB The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon is an important factor in land management decision making, climate change mitigation and landscape planning. In Scotland, where approximately one-quarter of the soils are peat, this information has usually been obtained using field survey and mapping, with digital soil mapping only carried out recently. Here a method is presented that integrates legacy survey data, recent monitoring work for peatland restoration surveys, spatial covariates such as topography and climate, and remote sensing data. The aim of this work was to provide estimates of the depth, bulk density and carbon concentration of Scotland's soils in order to allow more effective carbon stock mapping. A neural network model was used to integrate the existing data, and this was then used to generate a map of soil property estimates for carbon stock mapping at 100-m resolution over Scotland. Accuracy assessment indicated that the depth mapping to the bottom of the organic layer was achieved with anr(2)of .67, whereas carbon proportion and bulk density were estimated with anr(2)of .63 and .79, respectively. Modelling of these three properties allowed estimation of soil carbon in mineral and organic soils in Scotland to a depth of 1 m (3,498 megatons) and overall (3,688 megatons). Highlights
   Scotland's soil organic carbon was mapped using a digital soil mapping approach. This provides a high-resolution map available for scientists, regulatory bodies and policymakers. The method largely agreed with previous work but improved the spatial resolution of the mapping. Significant soil carbon stocks are held in both organic (peat) and non-peat soils.

AB Peatlands represent a globally important carbon stock. Peat soil carbon stock assessments rely on measurements of carbon concentration, bulk density and soil depth. However, peat surface levels - and thus soil depths - change ("bog breathing") largely as a response to peat shrinkage and expansion in relation to water table changes. This study assessed the magnitude of and potential for this mechanism to influence carbon stock calculations under field and laboratory conditions. In the UK, most peatlands are upland blanket bogs, of which a large proportion are managed as 'grouse moors'. This currently involves rotational burning, although alternative management is increasingly considered. Peat depth and water tables were investigated on three grouse moors on blanket bog in northern England, comparing changes under different heather management interventions (burning, mowing and uncut). One site also allowed investigation of changes in relation to slope and under the three major bog vegetation types (ling heather, cottongrass and Sphagnum moss), which were compared to observed changes in peat cores under controlled laboratory conditions simulating periods of drought and rewetting. Changes in depth and bulk density were recorded and the potential implications for carbon stock estimates were calculated. Results highlight site specific relationships as potential habitat condition indicators and demonstrate that previously reported surface peat carbon losses resulting from enhanced decomposition under rising temperatures might also be explained by apparent changes due to peat shrinkage and expansion. It is recommended to accurately record bulk density and total peat depth measurements as part of peat carbon stock assessments.

AB Background. Over 25% of the UK land area is covered by uplands, the bulk of which are comprised of blanket bog. This not only contains most of the UK's terrestrial carbon stocks, but also represents 15% of this globally rare habitat. About 30% of UK blanket bog is managed for red grouse by encouraging ling heather (Calluna vulgaris) with rotational burning, which has been linked to habitat degradation, with reduced carbon storage and negative impacts on water storage and quality. Alternative cutting is currently being pursued as a potential restoration management. However, the often used heavy cutting machinery could cause considerable compaction and damage to the peat surface. Two particular issues are (i) a potential increase in bulk density reducing water storage capacity (i.e., less pore volume and peat depth), and (ii) a possible reduction of the micro-topography due to cutting off the tops of hummocks (i.e., protruding clumps or tussocks of sedges).
   Methods. We set up a fully replicated field experiment assessing cutting versus burn management impacts on peat physical and surface properties. Both managements reflected commonly used grouse moor management practice with cutting using heavy tractors fitted with load distributing double wheel and tracks (lowering ground pressure), whilst burning was done manually (setting heather areas alight with flame torches). We assessed management impacts on peat depth, bulk density and peat surface micro-topography which either included pre-management measurements or plot-level data for uncut plots. Total peat depth and bulk density in four 5 cm sections within the top 50 cm was assessed. Micro-topography was determined as the standard deviation of the height offsets measured over several plot transects in relation to the plot peat surface level at the start and end points of each transect.
   Results. Despite an anticipated compaction from the heavy machinery used for cutting, the peat showed resilience and there was no lasting plot-level impact on either peat depth or bulk density. Notably, bulk density showed differences prior to, and thus unrelated to, management, and an overall increasing bulk density, even in uncut plots. However, cutting did reduce the plot micro-topography by about 2 cm, mostly due to removing the tops of hummocks, whereas burnt plots did not differ from uncut plots.
   Discussion. Cutting is suggested as a suitable alternative to burning on grouse moors, although compaction issues might be site specific, depending on the nature of the peat, the machinery used and impacts at resting and turning points (which were not assessed). However, any observed bulk density differences could reflect natural changes in relation to changes in peat moisture, requiring adequate experimental comparisons. Moreover, where micro-topography is a priority, cutting equipment might need to consider the specific ground conditions, which could involve adjusting cutting height and the type of cutting machinery used.

AB Peatlands are known to have accumulated and stored carbon over thousands of years and play a vital role in global greenhouse gas balances. However, there are still inadequate high quality estimates of peatland carbon stock at regional level especially in the James Bay Lowlands in Far North Ontario, Canada. The aim of this study is to estimate regional peatland carbon stock in a delineated watershed region in northern Ontario. SPOT 5 satellite data was used to delineate and classify peatland types using maximum likelihood standard algorithm. The peatland map derived from remote sensing was integrated with peat depth, carbon content and bulk density data in geographic information system (GIS) in order to estimate regional peatland carbon stock. The total regional peatland carbon stock was estimated using the following equation: area of peatland (ha) x depth of peat (m) x mean bulk density of peat (g m(-3)) x carbon content of dry mass (%) x conversion factor (10,000 m(2) ha(-1)). Peatlands in the study area covered a geographic area of about 130,429 ha and stored about 128 +/- 0.05 Tg of carbon. Peat carbon per unit area varied among peatland types with a mean +/- SD of 100 +/- 17 kg C m(-2). This high quality account of carbon stock estimates clearly demonstrates the high carbon stored by northern peatlands which makes them major carbon storehouses.

However, when peatlands are exploited for Sphagnum moss and horticultural peat, they become degraded and large, persistent sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Recent advances in peatland restoration techniques have succeeded in the re-vegetation of Sphagnum moss on previously cutover surfaces. The long-term success of peatland restoration depends on the development of a sufficiently thick new peat layer that has ecohydrological and hydrophysical properties similar to natural peatlands. We determined these properties for an upper (0-4 cm) and lower (8-12 cm) peat layer in a recently restored peatland, a naturally re-vegetated cutover peatland, and a natural peatland in eastern Quebec. The properties of the new peat layer differed significantly between the sites, especially for the lower layer samples. Lower samples for the natural and naturally re-vegetated sites had a bulk density of 43 +/- 5 and 41 +/- 11 kg m(-3), respectively, almost twice as high as the value for lower samples from the restored site (24 +/- 4 kg m(-3)). Sphagnum rubellum capitula density (rho(c)) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for the restored peatland (28 726 # m(-2)) compared to the natural site (26 050 # m(-2)). Residual moisture content at a soil water pressure of -200 tub (theta(r)) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) for the restored site in comparison to the natural and naturally re-vegetated sites for the lower samples. This suggests that S. rubellum in a natural peatland is able to hold onto more moisture under increasing soil tension than the same species growing in a restored site likely due to its higher bulk density and relatively more decomposed state. We suggest that it is possible that S. rubellum growing in the harsher cutover peatland environment has possibly allocated more carbohydrates to vertical growth and as a consequence has a lower bulk density and poorer water retention.

AB Peatlands are globally important carbon stores, yet both natural and human impacts can influence peatland carbon accumulation. While changes in climate can alter peatland water tables leading to changes in peat decomposition, managed burning of vegetation has also been claimed to reduce peat accumulation. Particularly in the UK, blanket bog peatlands are rotationally burned to encourage heather re-growth on grouse shooting estates. However, the evidence of burning impacts on peat carbon stocks is very limited and contradictory. We assessed peat carbon accumulation over the last few hundred years in peat cores from three UK blanket bog sites under rotational grouse moor burn management. High resolution (0.5cm) peat core analysis included dating based on spheroidal carbonaceous particles, determining fire frequency based on macro-charcoal counts and assessing peat properties such as carbon content and bulk density. All sites showed considerable net carbon accumulation during active grouse moor management periods. Averaged over the three sites, burns were more frequent, and carbon accumulation rates were also higher, over the period since 1950 than in the period 1700-1950. Carbon accumulation rates during the periods 1950-2015 and 1700-1850 were greater on the most frequently burnt site, which was linked to bulk density and carbon accumulation rates showing a positive relationship with charcoal abundance. Charcoal input from burning was identified as a potentially crucial component in explaining reported differences in burning impacts on peat carbon accumulation, as assessed by carbon fluxes or stocks. Both direct and indirect charcoal impacts on decomposition processes are discussed to be important factors, namely charcoal production converting otherwise decomposable carbon into an inert carbon pool, increasing peat bulk density, altering peat moisture and possibly negative impacts on soil microbial activity. This study highlights the value of peat core records in understanding management impacts on peat accumulation and carbon storage in peatlands.

AB Smoldering ground fires spread slowly (about 3 cm h-1) and can raise mineral soil temperatures above 300-degrees-C for several hours with peak temperatures near 600-degrees-C, resulting in decomposition of organic material and the death of soil organisms. Smoldering ground fire has potential for reigniting surface fire long after the main front has passed.  The rate of smoldering was examined with Canadian sphagnum peat moss as a representative fuel.  The time to burn a known amount of organic mass was monitored for different organic bulk densities and moisture and inorganic contents.  Organic bulk densities were comparable to the field and ranged from 90 to 180kg m-3.  Moisture and inorganic contents were expressed as mass ratios relative to the organic mass and covered the range of sustained smoldering combustion.  Moisture ratios, R(M), ran up to 0.8 and inorganic ratios, R(I), up to 4.0.  The burning rate is independent of the organic bulk density.  A universal burning rate, the unit area burn rate (UBR), was obtained by normalizing the burning rate to the area of the burning surface. It is expressed as follows:  UBR = 0.27-0.097 R(M) - 0.033(R(I)-D) g cm-2 h-1, where D = R(I) if R(I) < 1.0, and D = 1.0 if R(I) greater-than-or-equal-to 1.0.

AB Fens are important components of Canada's western boreal forests, occupying about 63% of the total peatland area and storing about 65% of the peatland carbon. Rich fens, dominated by true moss-dominated ground layers, make up more than half of the fens in the region. We studied organic matter accumulation in three rich fens that represent the diversity in structural types. We used in situ decomposition socks, a new method that examines actual decomposition throughout the upper peat profile over an extended period of time. We coupled our carbon loss data with macrofossil analyses and dated peat profiles using Pb-210. Across the three rich fens and in the top 39 cm of the peat column, dry mass increases on average 3.1 times. From our dry mass loss measurements, we calculate that annual mass loss from the top 39 cm varies from 0.52 to 1.08 kg m(2). Vertical accumulation during the past 50 years has varied from 16 to 32 cm and during these 50 years, organic matter accumulation has averaged 174 g m(-2) y(-1) compared to 527 g m(2) y(-1) dry mass loss, with additional mass losses of 306 g m(2) y(-1) from peat between 50 and 150 years of age. Organic matter accumulation from our rich fens compares well with literature values from boreal bogs, whereas peat bulk densities increase about three times within the uppermost 40 cm, much more than in bogs. Hence, rich fens accumulate peat not because the plant material is especially hard to decompose, is acidic, or has the catotelm especially close to the surface, but because dense, rapidly produced inputs outweigh the relatively rapid decomposition process of the upper peat column.

AB The movement of water within milled peat with respect to both drying and rewetting is of particular importance to the peat industry. Six milled peat types ranging from low to high density were analysed for humification, ash content, density, particle size distribution, hydraulic conductivity, apparent porosity and water characteristic curves. Results revealed significant variation in apparent porosity and in conjunction with shrink / swell this caused significant differences in bulk density despite the similarity in particle size distribution for all except one of the milled peat types studied. A reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity when packing density was increased was observed for all milled peat types, with up to an order of magnitude reduction found when bulk density was increased by 0.08 to 0.10 Mg / m(3). Estimates of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity taken from the water characteristic curve and the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity indicated that when milled peat is stockpiled the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities are similar for all milled peat types (ca. 10(-12) m / s). A generalized representation of the water characteristic curves indicated that high density milled peat contains more water (volumetric representation) at a given tension than low density milled peat. Estimates of apparent particle density and apparent total porosity suggest that there is a microstructure in milled peat that is not functional pore space.

AB Compacted soils are not uniformly hard; they usually contain structural cracks and biopores, the continuous large pores that are formed by soil fauna and by roots of previous crops; Roots growing in compacted soils can traverse otherwise impenetrable soil by using biopores and cracks and thus gain access to a larger reservoir of water and nutrients. Experiments were conducted ina growth chamber to determine the plant response to a range of uniform soil densities, and the effect of artificial and naturally-formed biopores. Barley plants grew best at an intermediate bulk density, which presumably represented a compromise between soil which was soft enough to allow good root development but sufficiently compact to give good root-soil contact. Artificial 3.2 mm diameter biopores made in hard soil gave roots access to the full depth of the pot and were occupied by roots more frequently than expected by chance alone. This resulted in increased plant growth in experiments where the soil was allowed to dry. Our experiments suggest that large biopores were not a favourable environment for roots in wet soil; barley plants grew better in pots containing a network of narrow biopores made by lucerne and ryegrass roots, responded positively to biopores being filled with peat, and some pea radicles died in biopores. A theoretical analysis of water uptake gave little support to the hypothesis that water supply to the leaves was limiting in either very hard or very soft soil. The net effect of biopores to the plant would be the benefits of securing extra water and nutrients from depth, offset by problems related to poor root-soil contact in the biopore and impeded laterals in the compacted biopore walls.

AB Forestry-drained peatlands occupy approximately 15 million ha in boreal and temperate zones. In Finland, they represent almost one-fourth of the total forest area. They are subjected to the same harvesting operations as upland forests. Although the soil deformation caused by timber harvesting is well documented in upland forests, the knowledge on the soil disturbance induced by the harvesting machinery on peat soils is still lacking. To address this, we collected soil samples from six peatland sites that were thinned using a harvester-forwarder combination. Peat samples were taken from the trails formed by the machinery and outside the trails to a depth of 10 cm. To assess the recovery of soil properties after the disturbance, we sampled sites along a chronosequence with respect to time since harvesting. Soil deformation under the machinery appeared to increase the bulk density and field capacity of peat and decrease its total porosity; however, disturbed plots and control plots started to resemble each other in their soil properties within 15 years. The results imply that peat soil is sensitive to disturbance but has a high recovery potential.

TI Calibration of time domain reflectometry for forest soil humus layers

DT Article
ID WATER-CONTENT; MOISTURE; PEAT; TDR
AB Time domain reflectometry (TDR) has become a widely used method for determining the volumetric water content of soils. However, due to the differences in bulk density and surface area, the relationship between the dielectric constant and water content in organic soils is very different from that in mineral soil. It is therefore impossible to have a universal calibration suitable for all soil types. In this article we describe the relationship between the apparent dielectric constant (K-a) and volumetric water content (theta(v)) for homogenized and undisturbed humus layers (Of + Oh) from forested soil using three empirical models. There was a clear relationship between the K-a and theta(v) and this relationship was best described (R-2 = 0.968) with a logarithmic equation of the form theta(v) = aln(K-a) - b. Accurate determination of sample volume was the main source of variation in the calibration, having a greater effect on the calibration results than differences in bulk density.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; RESTORATION; LEVEL
AB Bulk density was determined indirectly in peat samples by X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) and compared with density values obtained by standard laboratory methods. Five Histosols were collected in the same cut-over peatland, representing various degrees of disturbance related to the process of peat extraction. Soil cores were fully imaged by X-ray CT with a voxel size of about 0.25 mm. Each one of these five attenuation profiles was analysed and compared with direct density measurements. A linear relationship, to convert attenuation values into density values, is proposed to determine the variation in bulk density with a spatial resolution clearly greater than standard laboratory determinations. It is also shown that X-ray-based density values can be effectively used to characterize the structure of peat soils and the possible consequences of disturbances after drainage and peat mining. Under the accepted limitations of the method, X-ray CT opens up new opportunities to determine the structural quality of peat and to monitor its modifications with time. This indirect diagnostic could be particularly useful to study peatlands' hydraulic systems or evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures.

AB I evaluated production and decomposition characteristics of six dominant Sphagnum species in their natural microhabitats distributed along the gradient of water table in an open ombrotrophic bog. The growth in length was much higher in pools and hollows than in hummocks but the resulting annual production was roughly similar in the microhabitats due to a greater shoot density and consequently higher bulk density in hummocks. Although hummocks provided much higher potential for decomposition than hollows, the Sphagnum litter decomposed more slowly in hummocks due to much lower litter quality of the hummock sphagna. Thus the hummock Sphagnum species possess both principal mechanisms participating in maintaining hummocks above hollows - a sufficient production rate and limited decomposition rate. These mechanisms emphasize the role of Sphagnum mosses as autogenic ecosystem engineers controlling also the microhabitat diversification in patterned mires.

AB Ditch networks in drained peatland forests are maintained regularly to prevent water table rise and subsequent decrease in tree growth. The growing tree stand itself affects the level of water table through evapotranspiration, the magnitude of which is closely related to the living stand volume. In this study, regression analysis was applied to quantify the relationship between the late summer water table depth (D(WT)) and tree stand volume, mean monthly summertime precipitation (P(s)), drainage network condition, and latitude. The analysis was based on several large data sets from southern to northern Finland, including concurrent measurements of stand volume and summer water table depth. The identified model demonstrated a nonlinear effect of stand volume on D(WT), a linear effect of P(s) on D(WT), and an interactive effect of both stand volume and P(s). Latitude and ditch depth showed only marginal influence on D(WT). A separate analysis indicated that an increase of 10 m(3).ha(-1) in stand volume corresponded with a drop of 1 cm in water table level during the growing season. In a subsample of the data, high bulk density peat showed deeper D(WT) than peat with low bulk density at the same stand volume.

SO SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Deformation-stress-moisture relationships of cultivated sphagnum peat materials were studied in the laboratory using the Ottawa Texture Measuring System, an apparatus developed by Agriculture Canada. Impact of compaction on hydrologic characteristics was also investigated to determine the maximum stress which may be applied in the field during seed-bed preparation without limiting aeration for crop production. The study revealed that the compactibility of peat is relatively unaffected by moisture content at compactive pressure less-than-or-equal-to 13 kPa. However, under higher compactive pressure, the peat reaction was very similar to that of mineral soils, in which the compactibility increases with increasing moisture content until it reaches a maximum bulk density at saturation. The deformation-stress-moisture content relationships may be expressed by a simple third order polynomial equation. In response to compaction, the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the peat material reduced more than three orders of magnitude as bulk density increased from 0.1 to 0.25 g/cm3. A major increase in moisture retentivity was found in the compacted peat. Changes in hydrologic characteristics are primarily attributed to the reduction in large pores. Based on this information, it is concluded that compactive pressure exceeding 50 kPa may cause adverse effects on soil aeration.

DT Article
ID ORGANIC-MATTER; SPLASH DETACHMENT
AB This study follows an earlier one which showed that organic materials in form of peat and farmyard manure decreased wash erosion. A rainfall simulator was added to a soil test bed so that soil erosion by raindrops could be monitored. The design of the soil test bed allowed soil slope to be controlled. The apparatus was used to test the raindrop erosion of three Trinidadian soils (a sandy loam, a clay loam and another clay) with three levels of added peat (0%, 4% and 8% by mass), compacted at three levels (95 kPa, 137 kPa and 179 kPa) and exposed to a rainfall intensity of 90 mm h(-1) falling on soils on four slope gradients (9%, 15%, 21%, and 30%). The aim of the test was to investigate how peat reduces the soil erosion process and was carried out by making intermediary measurements of infiltration and runoff. Bulk density and penetration resistance of the soils were measured prior to the measurement of raindrop erosion. Both bulk density and penetration resistance decreased with increasing levels of peat in all the three soils. Mean cumulative infiltration decreased from 6.6 mm to 4.3 mm; mean cumulative runoff increased from 17.9 mm to 39.0 mm and soil erosion increased from 1.56 kg to 2.78 kg in each case when the soil slope increased from 9% to 30%. Peat incorporation increased infiltration, and decreased runoff and soil erosion in all soils at all combinations of slopes and compaction efforts. Soil erosion was greater in the sandy loam than in the clay and clay loam soils. Compaction of the soil was found to increase surface runoff and decrease infiltration and soil loss. Results from this study confirm that the major reason why peat reduces soil erosion by rainfall is its effect in decreasing bulk density, increasing infiltration, and reducing runoff, rather than stabilising the soil. Multiple linear regression equations were developed for predicting soil erosion from the experimental factors. The results of this study further emphasise that for soil conservation, apart from adopting land use zoning of soils based on slopes, the incorporation of organic materials in steep arable slopes will greatly reduce soil erosion by water.

AB Carbon density is a key variable in assessments of local or regional soil carbon (C) stocks, but its direct measurement on large numbers of samples is both time-consuming and expensive. To assess whether the C density of organic soils can be inferred from other parameters, we examined the ability of field- (stratigraphic depth and material type) and lab- (bulk density and ash content) based variables to predict the C density of organic soil samples. Candidate models given three different levels of a priori information about samples were developed from data for continental western Canada and examined using Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Models at each level were then used to predict profile-level C storage in cores from three different regions (continental western Canada, Ontario, and the Northwest Territories). In profiles from western Canada, predictions were unbiased, with mean prediction errors of 0-7% and local precision depending on the amount of a priori information available. Application of models to other regions yielded mixed results, probably reflecting both differences in site characteristics and classification/analytical methods used. Since these error sources are impossible to separate given available data, we recommend that models for C density prediction should be tailored to a given research question and region. The results suggest that simple, field-based variables are sufficient to predict C density for the purpose of regional surveys. To obtain accurate estimates at the profile level, bulk density (and ash or C content) have to be measured in the lab.

SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID FOREST FLOOR; CLASSIFICATION; WISCONSIN; HISTOSOLS; ALASKA; PEATS
AB Holocene-aged basaltic lava flows offer a unique opportunity to study the initial stages of soil formation. In the cool, dry climate at Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (CROM) in southern Idaho, organic soils (Histosols in Soil Taxonomy) are the dominant soil on recent lava surfaces. Unsaturated Histosols, or Folists (Folic Histosols in World Reference Base [WRB]), occupy crevices and depressions on the lava surface and support vegetation adapted for life in this harsh environment. These soils are comprised of either a thin fibric (Oi horizon) over a hemic (Oe horizon) or a single, relatively homogenous Oe horizon over relatively unweathered basalt bedrock. The parent material for organic soils is biologic rather than geologic in origin with parent vegetation growing in crevices supplying the necessary organic debris. Soil acidity is directly influenced by the type of vegetation growing in the soil, with more acidic leaf litter creating lower pH soils while more alkaline plant debris generates soil with more neutral pH. Within these shallow soils (12-35 cm), organic C content (mean 333 g kg(-1)) is proportional to fiber content and cation-exchange capacity (CEC) and inversely proportional to bulk density. Compared with Folists of wetter climates, those forming at CROM have substantially higher bulk densities with a mean of 0.41 g cm(-3). The influence of loessial mineral material likely accounts for the increased mineral content and subsequent increase in bulk density. Knowledge of the morphological, physical, and chemical properties of Folists at CROM is essential to improve our understanding of the ecological significance of Folists and co-evolution of soils and plant communities in a cool, and environment.

AB We replaced a control peat medium with up to 75% biochar on a volumetric basis in three different forms (powder, BC; pyrolyzed softwood pellets, PP; composite wood-biochar pellets, WP), and under two supplies of nitrogen fertilizer (20 or 80 mg N) subsequently grew seedlings with a comparable morphology to the control. Using gravimetric methods to determine irrigation frequency and exponential fertilization to ensure all treatments received the same amount of N at a given point in the growing cycle, we successfully replaced peat with 25% BC and up to 50% PP. Increasing the proportion of biochar in the media significantly increased pH and bulk density and reduced effective cation exchange capacity and air-filled porosity, although none of these variables was consistent with resultant seedling growth. Adherence to gravimetric values for irrigation at an 80% water mass threshold in the container revealed that the addition of BC and WP, but not PP, required adjustments to the irrigation schedule. For future studies, we encourage researchers to provide more details about bulk density, porosity, and irrigation regime to improve the potential inference provided by this line of biochar and growing media work.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is approximately 265 times more potent than carbon dioxide (CO2) in atmospheric warming. Degraded peatlands are important sources of N2O. The more a peat soil is degraded, the higher the N2O-N emissions from peat. In this study, soil bulk density was used as a proxy for peat degradation to predict N2O-N emissions. Here we report that the annual N2O-N emissions from European managed peatlands (EU-28) sum up to approximately 145 Gg N year(-1). From the viewpoint of greenhouse gas emissions, highly degraded agriculturally used peatlands should be rewetted first to optimally reduce cumulative N2O-N emissions. Compared to a business-as-usual scenario (no peatland rewetting), rewetting of all drained European peatlands until 2050 using the suggested strategy reduces the cumulative N2O-N emissions by 70%. In conclusion, the status of peat degradation should be made a pivotal criterion in prioritising peatlands for restoration.
   Rewetting agricultural peatlands first is the best strategy for reducing cumulative nitrous oxide emissions from European peatlands, according to an analysis of soil bulk density as a proxy for peat degradation.

AB A series of soilless root substrates was formulated to contain either 20% composted pine bark or perlite and 0%, 10%, 20%, or 30% feather fiber, with the remainder being sphagnum peat. The substrates containing bark or perlite with 0% feather fiber served as the controls for the bark- and perlite-containing substrates respectively. For root substrates containing perlite, the inclusion of feather fiber increased the total pore space compared with the control substrate. For substrates containing bark, the inclusion of 10% or 20% feather fiber increased total pore space, but the inclusion of 30% feather fiber reduced total pore space. For substrates containing perlite, the inclusion of feather fiber increased the air-filled pore space compared with the control, and as the percentage feather fiber increased, air-filled pore space increased. For substrates containing bark, the inclusion of 10% or 20% feather fiber increased air-filled pore space, but air-filled pore space of the substrate containing 30% feather fiber was not different from the control. For all substrates, the inclusion of feather fiber reduced the water-holding capacity, but water-holding capacities for all substrates remained within recommended ranges. The bulk density of feather fiber-containing substrates was not different from the control except for the substrate containing 30% feather fiber with bark, which had a higher bulk density than its control without feather fiber. The difference in physical properties of the 30% feather fiber substrate with bark from its control substrate was attributed to the aggregation of the feather fiber when formulated with composted bark. Aggregation of feather fiber when blended into substrates at levels of 30% or higher would create difficulties in achieving uniform substrates.

AB Erosion from peat extraction areas is known to cause siltation of water courses and poor water quality. However, the main soil parameters affecting peat erosion and suspended sediment (SS) yields from different catchments are not well understood. This paper used peat properties (degree of humification, peat type, ash content, porosity, moisture content, bulk density, and shear strength) and novel erosion threshold measurements from intact soil cores to explain peat erodibility and spatial variations in SS concentrations (SSCs) and SS loads (SSLs) at 20 Finnish peat extraction sites. The erosion threshold measurements suggested that critical shear stresses for particle entrainment decrease with increasing degree of humification (von Post scale) and are significantly lower in well-decomposed peat than in slightly or moderately decomposed peat. Two critical shear stresses were obtained from moderately decomposed peat samples, indicating a degree of surface armoring by coarse peat fibers. Monitored long-term average SSC was highest at study sites with well-decomposed peat, while very fine-grained mineral subsoil explained some of the highest long-term SSC in areas where drainage ditches penetrated below the upper peat layer. Average SSL (kg d(-1)) at the study sites was best explained (R-2=0.89) by average discharge and surface peat decomposition level. Overall, this study provides new knowledge on peat erosion and critical shear stresses that can be used in water conservation and sediment management practices for cutover peatlands and other similar land uses.

ID PERMITTIVITY
AB The apparent bulk electrical conductivity (sigma(a)) of eleven soils from Trinidad tropic region was measured in the field and the laboratory with a portable Field Scout soil water content/electrical conductivity probe. The effect on sigma(a) of compacting three of the soils (a sandy loam, clay loam and clay) to three or four bulk densities (1.1, 1.3 and 1.5 and 1.7 t m(-3)), each with four levels of peat (0, 4%, 8%, and 12% by mass) at four gravimetric water contents (5, 12, 19 and 26%) was further investigated in the laboratory. The sigma(a) measured in the field ranged from 0.09 to 0.75 dS m(-1) and was within 0.05 dS m(-1) of the corresponding laboratory-measured values for the individual soils. Electrical conductivity of the laboratory-compacted soils, which ranged from 0 to 0.66 dS m(-1), increased with increasing bulk density, water and peat contents. The clay soil exhibited greater values of sigma(a) than the clay loam or sandy loam soils, at given values of bulk density, water and peat contents. Good agreement was found between the field and laboratory measurements of sigma(a) as well as electrical conductivity of the saturated water extracts from individual soils. Apparent bulk electrical conductivity was significantly affected by the interaction between soil type and water content, and between peat content and water content. A multiple linear regression equation was developed from experimental data to determine the relative importance of the experimental parameters on sigma(a). (C) 2010 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID BULK-DENSITY; PEAT; MOISTURE; FIRES
AB Smoldering combustion of natural organic layers like peatlands leads to the largest fires on Earth. Smoldering wildlfires may propagate slowly for several months, consuming organic matter and threatening to release ancient carbon stored deep in the soil. It has become a topic of global interest linked to ecosystem perturbations, carbon sequestration and climate change. Although experimental studies have revealed the main factors affecting ignition and spread of natural smoldering, there is little modeling work explaining these experiments. This study aims at bridging the gap by developing a numerical model of smoldering combustion spreading downwards through a column of organic soil. Two spreading fronts are considered, drying and combustion, fed by oxygen diffusion through the top ash layer. The model predicts the transient evolution of the temperature profiles in a vertical column, and the smoldering rate for organic soils with different properties. The role of moisture content, inorganic content, bulk density and heat of smoldering combustion in the critical conditions for self-sustained propagation is investigated. The simulation results show that the critical moisture content increases linearly with heat of smoldering combustion, decreases linearly with the inorganic content and decreases with organic bulk density. These results are consistent with previous experimental observations, indicating the model is capable for guiding further experimental studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Information on the variation in soil element concentrations at different spatial scales is needed for, e.g., designing efficient sampling strategies, upscaling the processes related to carbon cycling, and planning land use and management. In spite of intensive land use, such information concerning peat soils is still scarce. We analyzed the variation in peat mineral element concentrations in boreal peatland forests drained 50-60 years earlier. We wanted to quantify the proportions of variation deriving from differences between regions and peatland basins and from within-peatland heterogeneity, and to model the variation using relatively easily measurable site and soil characteristics. We utilized 878 peat samples representing the 0-20 cm layer and collected from 289 sites in 79 peatland basins. The sites represented three different drained peatland forest site types. The two strongest gradients in the element composition captured by principal component analysis were correlated with both the North-South gradient and the site type variation, and the East-West gradient. In general, most of the variation in the element concentrations was contributed by differences among peatland basins, and variation within the floristically determined sites. Most of the element concentrations were best modeled when either the bulk density or the ash content of the peat, or both, were used in addition to site type and geographical location. The explanatory power remained modest for most element concentrations. As for the P concentrations in soil, however, our models provide means for estimating a large part of the variation among drained pine mire sites.

AB Peatlands form a large but unstable C store. Drainage of peatlands converts them into C sources, which is undesirable if increases in atmospheric CO2 levels are to be minimised. Therefore, quantification of C stocks and an understanding of which ecosystems or management regimes are capturing or emitting C is needed. Such information is scarce for temperate European forests. We studied the soil properties of sixteen peatlands in Switzerland, representing three forest types, to test whether peatlands that are more strongly affected by drainage (according to vegetation) have lost their function as C sinks or stores. Bulk density and ash enrichment, as well as H/C, O/C and C/N quotients, indicated that the soils of the two forest types that appeared to be more strongly affected by drainage were more degraded and had lost their functions as C stores. Longterm net rates of C loss estimated using the ash residue method were similar across all three forest types, for sites where this could be estimated.

AB Atlantic white cedar wetlands have pronounced hummock-hollow microtopography, in which the hummocks may be covered by Sphagnum spp. or may have only a layer of needle and leaf litter present. I tested the hypotheses that characteristics of the hummock peat, including moisture content, bulk density, redox potential and fiber content, would vary linearly with elevation above the water table, and that these relationships would not vary between moss- and litter-covered surfaces. These hypotheses underlie the frequent use of microsite elevation as an indicator of habitat differentiation in wetlands. I found that moisture and redox potential varied with elevation, but bulk density and fiber content were independent of elevation. Furthermore, moisture and redox status on Sphagnum-covered microsites had a weaker relationship to elevation (lower slope coefficient and lower r(2)) than on litter-covered microsites. Principal components analyses showed that Sphagnum-covered microsites were differentiated primarily on the basis of the relative content of undecomposed and decomposed fibers, while litter-covered sites were differentiated primarily on the basis of moisture and elevation. These results suggest that environmental gradients on hummock-hollow systems are complex and not a simple reflection of elevation. Environmental disturbances that reduce Sphagnum cover may affect vegetation by creating more drought-prone microsites on the tops of the hummocks, and this may be important for management of cedar regeneration.

AB Drainage of peatlands for forestry causes the water level to draw down, which results in subsidence of peat surface and increased peat bulk density (D-b) Later on, an accelerated rate of organic matter decomposition and the pressure of the growing tree stand further compacts the peat. We measured the peat D-b (0-80 cm) in 180 undrained and 209 drained (ca. 60-year-old) peatland sites representing three nutrient levels of pine fens and five macroclimatic regions from southern to northern Finland. D-b was affected by climatic conditions, nutrient status, and the tree stand volume of the site. D-b was significantly higher in drained than in undrained sites in all regions and site types: the mean (+/-SD) D-b in the whole material was 82 +/- 23 kg.m(-3) for the undrained sites and 133 +/- 22 kg.m(-3) for the drained sites. The increase in D-b was significant in all regions down to a depth of 60 cm and in southern Finland, even deeper than 80 cm. When the increase in carbon concentration was taken into consideration, the average postdrainage increase in the Db Of the 0-80 cm layer equalled the amount of carbon in the 54-cm layer in average undrained peat. As the reported subsidences of pear surface in forest drainage areas in Finland are usually below this limit, the carbon storage of peat is likely to increase after drainage.

AB Low soil organic matter content and limited soil water holding are the major natural constraint of dryland cropping on sandy soils in the Quebec boreal regions. We conducted a 3-yr (1994-1996) study in a boreal sandy soil, Ferro-Humic Podzol (Spodosols), to determine the potential of Sphagnum peat for improving soil organic matter (SOM), water holding capacity, bulk density (BD), plant leaf nutrient status, and potato and barley yields. The cropping was a rotation of 2-yr potato (Solanum tuberosum L. 'Superior') and 1-yr barley (Hordeum vulgare L. 'Chapais'). The treatments consisted of Sphagnum peat at rates of 0, 29, 48, and 68 Mg ha(-1) 3-yr(-1) on a dry weight basis, and granular N-P-K fertilizers (12-7.5-7) at rates of 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, arranged in a split-block design. The peat-amended soils were higher in water content (SWC), SOM and total porosity but lower in BD and N than neighboring non-peat soils (P < 0.05). Effects of peat and fertilizer treatments and their interaction were significant on potato leaf N, Ca, Mg, and P, tuber yield, dry weight, harvested N and tuber specific gravity (P < 0.05), depending on year. Potato tuber yield and N increased simultaneously up to 30% (compared to the control), and were significantly correlated with SWC, SOM, BD, and NO3-N (-0.52 less than or equal to r less than or equal to 0.80). In the 3rd year, the linear effect of peat treatments was significant on barley grain yield. In 1995 there was a decline of 4.5-7.3% of SOM of the previous year level. It is suggested that Sphagnum peat at a rate of 48 Mg ha(-1) had the potential for improving sandy soil productivity. A longer-term investigation of soil water, N, SOM pool and crop yield changes is necessary to better understand the physical, chemical and biological processes of peat in cropping systems and to maximize the benefits of peat applications.

TI A NEW METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE BULK DENSITY OF UNCOMPACTED PEAT FROM
   FIELD SETTINGS
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SAMPLER; CORES
AB A new method for determining the bulk density of uncompacted surficial peat from field settings is presented. Most importantly, a new peat sampler was developed to ensure minimum disturbance of the peat sample. The main benefits of the new device are (1) from the moment of field sampling, the peat sample remains undisturbed in an inner collecting liner, which has a fixed volume and fits perfectly in an outer cutting tube, until the sample is ready to be analyzed in a laboratory, (2) the risk of fracturing or disturbing the sample during lifting it to the surface is significantly reduced by using a vacuum pump or hose to reduce suction at the base of the peat core, and (3) the razor-sharp cutting edge of the outer tube easily cuts through all kinds of fibers by short rotational movements. Furthermore, sufficiently large samples can be extracted, thereby accounting for the heterogeneous character of peat. The device is relatively light and easy to operate, which is a great advantage in the often remote and difficult-to-access peatlands. The sampler was successfully used during test trials on different types of fen peat in the Biebrza National Park, Poland.

AB Peatlands store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Depending on their present condition, they act as a source or sink of carbon dioxide. Therefore, peatlands are highly relevant for climate change investigations and there is considerable interest to assess spatial heterogeneity of peat soil properties in order to assess the total amount of stored carbon. However, reliable information about peat properties remains difficult to obtain at the field scale. A potential way to acquire this information is the indirect mapping of easily recordable physical variables that correlate with peat properties, such as the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). In this study, we aim to explore the potential of multi-coil offset electromagnetic induction (EMI) measurements to provide spatial estimates of SOC content, bulk density, and SOC stock for a highly variable and disturbed peatland relict (similar to 35 ha) with a remaining peat layer thickness of less than 1 m. EMI measurements comprised six integral depths that varied from 0-0.25 to 0-1.80 m. In combination with ancillary laser-scanning elevation data, a multiple linear regression model was calibrated to reference data from 34 soil cores that were used to calculate integral properties of the upper 0.25, 0.5, and 1 m layer, as well as for the total peat layer. Leave-one-out cross-validation for the different depth ranges resulted in a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) between 1.36 and 5.16% for SOC content, between 0.108 and 0.183 g cm(-3) for bulk density, and between 3.56 and 9.73 kg m(-2) for SOC stocks, which corresponds to roughly 15%, 10%, and 20% of the total field variability, respectively. The selection of explanatory variables in the regression models showed that the EMI data were important for accurate model predictions, while the topography-based variables mainly acted as noise suppressors. The accuracy of the SOC content estimates roughly equalled the quality of SOC content predictions obtained in previous field applications of the visible-near infrared technique (vis-NIR). The spatial variation of the predicted peat layer properties showed similarities to the former land use distribution. Overall, it was concluded that EMI measurements offer a useful alternative to the established vis-NIR method for SOC content mapping in carbon-rich soils. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Restiad bogs dominated by Sporadanthus traversii on Chatham Island, New Zealand, were sampled to correlate vegetation patterns and peat properties, and to compare with restiad systems dominated by Sporadanthus ferrugineus and Empodisma minus in the Waikato region, North Island, New Zealand. Classification and ordination resulted in five groups that reflected a disturbance gradient. The largest S. traversii group, which comprised plots from central, relatively intact bogs, had the lowest levels of total nitrogen (mean 1.20 mg cm(-3)), total phosphorus (mean 0.057 mg cm(-3)), total potassium (mean 0.083 mg cm(-3)), and available phosphorus (mean 18.6 mug cm(-3)). Modification by drainage, stock, and fires resulted in a decline of S. traversii and an increase of Gleichenia dicarpa fern cover, together with elevated peat nutrient levels and higher bulk density. Compared with peat dominated by Sporadanthus ferrugineus or Empodisma minus in relatively unmodified Waikato restiad bogs, Chatham Island peat under S. traversii has significantly higher total potassium, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, bulk density, and von Post decomposition indices, and significantly lower pH. Sporadanthus traversii and Empodisma minus have similar ecological roles in restiad bog development, occupying a relatively wide nutrient range, and regenerating readily from seed after fire. Despite differences in root morphology, S. traversii and E. minus are the major peat formers in raised restiad bogs on Chatham Island and in Waikato, respectively, and could be regarded as ecological equivalents.

TI QUANTITATIVE PHYSICAL ASSESSMENT OF ORGANIC MATERIALS USED IN SPORTS
   TURF ROOTZONE MIXES
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SOILS
AB Peats and other organic materials are commonly used in sports turf rootzone mixes, yet few quantitative guidelines exist for selecting appropriate materials and incorporation rates.  This study was conducted to assess the relative merits of organic sources and to identify a physical measure to assess the role of organic materials in rootzones.  Five organic materials with organic contents ranging from 96 to 40% by weight and fiber contents ranging from 54 to 7% by weight were mixed with a mason sand at rates of 10, 20, and 30% by volume.  Standard physical measures of bulk density, compressibility, saturated hydraulic conductivity, non-capillary porosity, and plant-available water revealed few differences between the organic sources for a given mixing rate.  Regression relations between organic matter by weight and bulk density, and available water suggest that 3% organic matter (by weight) is required in order to attain bulk densities < 1.45 Mg m-3, and 3.5% organic matter is required for available water contents > 0.2 m3 m-3.  Water retention curves were used to determine the pore volume distribution for each organic source and mixing rate.  The pore volume distributions were bimodal and revealed differences between the organic sources and mixing rates that were not apparent from standard physical tests.  Analysis of these distributions suggest that organic sources having fiber contents > 45% may be excessively coarse, and organic material incorporation rates should be selected so the final mix does not exceed 3.5% organic matter by weight.

AB Background and Aims The ecosystem engineers Sphagnum (peat mosses) are responsible for sequestering a large proportion of carbon in northern peatlands. Species may respond differently to hydrological changes, and water level changes may lead to vegetation shifts in peatlands, causing them to revert from sinks to sources of carbon. We aimed to compare species-specific responses to water level drawdown within Sphagnum, and investigate which traits affect water economy in this genus.
   Methods In a mesocosm experiment, we investigated how water level drawdown affected water content (WC) in the photosynthetically active apex of the moss and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (i.e. F-v/F-m) of 13 Sphagnum species. Structural traits were measured, and eight anatomical traits were quantified from scanning electron microscopy micrographs.
   Key Results Mixed-effects models indicated that at high water level, large leaves were the most influential predictor of high WC, and at low water level WC was higher in species growing drier in the field, with larger hyaline cell pore sizes and total pore areas associated with higher WC. Higher stem and peat bulk density increased WC, while capitulum mass per area and numerical shoot density did not. We observed a clear positive relationship between F-v/F-m and WC in wet-growing species.
   Conclusions While we found that most hummock species had a relatively high water loss resistance, we propose that some species are able to maintain a high WC at drawdown by storing large amounts of water at a high water level. Our result showing that leaf traits are important warrants further research using advanced morphometric methods. As climate change may lead to more frequent droughts and thereby water level drawdowns in peatlands, a mechanistic understanding of species-specific traits and responses is crucial for predicting future changes in these systems.

AB Holocene limnic deposits characteristic of the average latitudes have partially outcropped as a result of young glacial sculpture aging. The change of the environment from limnic to telmatic and often the interference of a man associated with the regulation of water relations led to the emergence of limnic deposits that underwent the process of pedogenesis. In this work, 137 samples of carbonate deposits from 6 sites in NW Poland were analyzed in terms of their physical properties. Carbonate sediments were subject to determination of specific and bulk densities, total porosity and air porosity, current and capillary water capacity. On the basis of CaCO3 content, combustion loss, and non-lime mineral content, the studied sediments were classified into three groups: lacustrine chalk, calcareous gyttja, and clay-calcareous gyttja. Studies have shown that the sediments subject to pedogenesis in the top levels have characteristic morphological features in the form of cracks and numerous channels and iron fills in the form of spotted, streaked or marbled mosaic. The top levels of sediments, as a result of dehydration, clearly increase their bulk density. Properties of the lake chalk were formed mainly by the proportion of organic matter and CaCO3, while in the case of carbonate gyttja, the influence of mineral parts of the non-lime substances is also highlighted. In the top of carbonate sediments, there is a decrease in general and capillary porosity and an increase in the share of macropores.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability and optimum rate of addition of Urban Biochar (UB) as an alternative to standard coir peat in plant growing media. UB was prepared through pyrolysis of 2: 1 ratio of biosolids to greenwaste on a dry mass basis. Two incubation experiments are reported both with five different growing media mixtures which were subjected to periodic wetting and drying. Media mixtures consisted of different rates of UB (100%, 60%, 40%, 20%) mixed with composted pine bark on a volume basis and compared to an industry standard media with 0% UB. The physical and chemical properties of the mixtures were compared pre and post incubation. Substituting coir peat with UB increased media pH, C:N mass ratio, nutrient content, air filled porosity and bulk density. Furthermore, addition of UB to media also increased the proportion of particles in the desirable range for growing media (0.25-2 mm). UB amended mixes were found to be most stable in terms of both bulk density and resistance to particle breakdown. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis suggested that periodic wetting and drying enhanced surface oxidation. We found that UB amended substrates, up to 60% biochar on a volume basis, could deliver similar physical and chemical benefits to those of coir peat based industry standard media.

AB Blanket peat and other moorland soils store the largest proportion of the soil organic carbon resource (SOC) in the United Kingdom. However, current understanding of the quantity and distribution of upland SOC is limited and approaches are needed to quantify carbon storage over large areas, whilst adequately representing spatial variability at a smaller scale. This article presents a methodology for quantifying and mapping SOC distribution at a landscape scale in blanket peatlands on Dartmoor, South West England. Using stratified sampling, twenty-nine cores were taken from a range of depths within each of the soil types found in the study area. Depth was strongly correlated with bulk density (r(2) = 0.70, P < 0.001) and loss on ignition (r(2) = 0.51, P < 0.001) for blanket peat, with weaker or non-existent relationships in other soil types. These regression relationships were used with peat depth mapping, to model carbon distribution and quantity. The results estimate 9.7 +/- 2.97 Mt of carbon is stored in Dartmoor's organic soils, and that blanket peat has a much higher carbon content per unit area than other organic soils. Sensitivity analysis revealed that bulk density and peat depth were equally influential in calculating carbon stocks, whilst variability in organic matter content was relatively unimportant. A comparison between the Dartmoor inventory and the national SOC inventory showed reasonable agreement for total C storage, but on an individual cell-by-cell basis disagreement between the inventories was often large. We conclude that when higher resolution SOC distribution is required (<100 km(2)), such as for individual land holdings and management, the approach presented within this article provides a suitable carbon inventory.

AB Across Canada's boreal forest, linear disturbances, including cutlines such as seismic lines and roads, crisscross the landscape to facilitate resource exploration and extraction; many of these linear disturbances cross peatland ecosystems. Changes in tree canopy cover and the compression of the peat by heavy equipment alter local thermal, hydrological, and ecological conditions, likely changing carbon exchange on the disturbance, and possibly in the adjacent peatland. We measured bulk density, water table, soil temperature, plant cover, and CO2 and CH4 flux along triplicate transects crossing a winter road through a wooded fen near Peace River, Alberta, Canada. Sample plots were located 1, 5, and 10 m from the road on both sides with an additional three plots on the road. Productivity of the overstory trees, when present, was also determined. The winter road had higher bulk density, shallower water table, higher graminoid cover, and thawed earlier than the adjacent peatland. Tree productivity and CO2 flux varied between the plots, and there was no clear pattern in relation to distance from the road. The plots on the winter road acted as a greater CO2 sink and greater CH4 source compared to the adjacent peatland with plots on the winter road emitting on average (standard error) 479 (138) compared to 41 (10) mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1) in the adjacent peatland. Considering both gases, global warming potential increased from 70 to 250 g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1) in the undisturbed area to 2100 g CO(2)e m(-2) year(-1) on the winter road. Although carbon fluxes on any given cutline through peatland will vary depending on level of compaction, line width and vegetation community shifts, the large number of linear disturbances in Canada's boreal forest and slow recovery on peatland ecosites suggest they could represent an important anthropogenic greenhouse gas source.

TI Effectiveness of organic matter incorporation in reducing soil

SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

ID DENSITY
AB Incorporation of organic matter (OM) into soil can reduce its susceptibility to compaction. However, the significance of incorporated OM for different soil and soil water conditions is not well documented. We investigated the effectiveness of incorporated OM at different soil and soil water conditions and the OM effect on strength and structure recovery of compacted soils. A sandy soil (sandy Orthod), a silt loam (loamy Udalf), and a clay soil (clayey Umbrept) were amended with up to 80 g kg(-1) of highly and slightly humified peat. The peat-soil mixtures were compacted at different water contents using the standard Proctor procedure. Soil strength was determined with a penetrometer. Structure recovery was determined by bulk density changes and disintegration of clods through wetting-drying cycles. For the cohesive silt loam and clay soils, OM was most effective at reducing compactibility at water contents lower than those for maximum Proctor compaction. For the sandy soil, OM was most effective at the Proctor-optimum water content. The slightly humified peat had a greater effect than the highly humified. We found that OM is most effective for soils with high compactibility. The maximum penetration resistance, P-max of the clay soil was reduced from 0.49 to 0.30 MPa, and that of the sandy soil increased from 0.64 to 1.08 MPa. For the silt loam, 30 g kg(-1) peat content had the highest P-max. After five wetting-drying cycles, bulk densities showed no significant differences among treatments. Clod disintegration was hindered by the OM incorporation. Although soil compactibility was reduced by OM incorporation, OM was more effective as soil compactibilty increased and at water contents lower than or close to the Proctor-optimum water content. Structure recovery of compacted soils was not improved. The penetration resistance after compaction is not consistently related to the incorporated OM.

AB The paper focuses on the role of ants as soil engineers in three drained fens. Physical, chemical and biotic soil conditions and effects. of ants on soil conditions were compared between fens differing in peat origin. Multivariate statistical methods were applied (PCA, RDA).
   Relationships between soil moisture, indices of the amount of nutrients soil biological activity, and released were better expressed in the anthill soil than in the adjacent soil. A lower bulk density of the anthill soil, thus, a higher soil porosity, enhanced the leaching of water- extractable, mobile metallic cations and nitric ions. The composition of humus fraction was strongly dependent on soil chemical properties. In both the anthill soil and the adjacent soil, the content of humic acids was positively related with bulk density, whereas the content of humins was related with moisture. In adjacent soil, cation exchange capacity (CEC) was positively related with the content of humic acids and with bulk density. This relationship was not so clear in the anthill soil.
   The direction of changes in these relationships in the anthill soil was influenced by ant societies. The number of individuals in society determined the nest structure and the associated increase in soil humidity and porosity. The consumption by ants, thus the input of matter rich in nitrogen, influenced the functional, structure of microorganisms and their activity.

AB Rooted cuttings of Dendranthema grandiflora Tzvelev., Nerium oleander L. and Lantana camara L., as well as seedlings of Pelargonium zonale L. were grown in media containing cotton gin trash compost, rice hulls, peat and perlite in various ratios, and their vegetative growth and flowering was determined and compared with a control medium of 1peat:1perlite (by volume). When up to 60% of peat in the control medium was replaced by cotton gin trash compost plant height was slightly reduced, except in P. zonale, the number of flowers was increased, except in pot D. grandiflora, and flowering was accelerated in all species except N. oleander. When half or all the perlite of the control was replaced by rice hulls, plant height and flower number was similar to that of the control plants, except in pot D. grandiflora where the number of flowers was reduced and in cut D. grandiflora where both stem length and flower number were reduced; also, in L. camara total replacement of perlite by rice hulls gave shorter plants. In media that contained cotton gin trash compost, peat and rice hulls, plant height of all species except P. zonale was reduced. Partitioning of cotton gin trash compost or rice hulls in the media decreased their total porosity and their easily available water, while cotton gin trash compost increased bulk density. When rice hulls totally replaced the perlite, bulk density was decreased. The media with peat, cotton gin trash compost and rice hulls and the one with peat and rice hulls had the lowest easily available water and total porosity of all the media tested. Media with cotton gin trash compost had a high electrical conductance at the beginning of the culture period, but it fell to the level of the control by the end.

AB An approach was developed and tested to spatial assessment of soil organic carbon stock in uniform groups of mineral and organic (litters, peat deposits, and peaty horizons of semihydromorphic soils) soil horizons. Estimation algorithm allowed us to utilize various datasets with different scales, both spatially and attributive sparse data of different veracities, which complemented each other. A series of maps of different accuracies and scales, including coarse-scale maps covering the entire country and more detailed maps for regions well covered with field measurements. Using these maps, the total organic carbon amount and its distribution over different pools in the 30-cm topsoil layer for the entire Russia and for three administrative regions of European Russia (more detailed) were estimated. The soil organic carbon pool of mineral soil horizons was estimated at 101 Gt C, which corresponded to 62% of the total organic carbon stock within the layer of 0-30 cm; 38% is allocated in organic horizons, including 9% in litter horizons (in rapidly decomposing organic pool) and 29% in peat deposit and peaty horizons of semihydromorphic soils. The organic carbon stocks in the 30-cm soil layer gradually increase from the north to the south: from 87 t/ha in Vologda oblast to 91 t/ha in Moscow oblast and 109 t/ha in Rostov oblast. The share of organic horizons in the total carbon stock decreases from the north to the south. Information on the size and structure of organic carbon pools may facilitate more reliable assessments of soil tolerance toward natural and anthropogenic changes and the development of regionally specific land use strategies.

AB Drainage, tillage, and intensive land use lead to drastic alterations in physical characteristics of organic soils. As decomposition and soil formation progress, bulk density (rho(b)) increases and total porosity (f(t)) decreases due to subsidence, shrinkage, and mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM). However, the rate of subsidence and the changes in soil properties differ among management systems. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of different tillage practices on rho(b) and f(t) of cultivated peat soils. These experiments were conducted during 2004-2005, on Histosols in north central Ohio. Soil core samples were obtained from experimental plots managed with moldboard plow (MB), no-till (NT), or left bare (B). Conversion of plow tillage to NT increased Pb from 0.52 to 0.57 Mg m(-3), and decreased f, from 0.72 to 0.70 m(3) m(-3). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at national level were estimated to provide more accurate estimates on SOC for the Lithuanian GHG inventory. The SOC stocks in the forest floor, grassland litter, and in mineral or organic topsoil (0-30 cm) of forest land, grasslands, and croplands were estimated. The assessment was based on forest floor and peat topsoil mass, mineral topsoil bulk density, and carbon concentration in 754 permanent observation plots on 9 x 9 km grid of the National Forest Inventory in Lithuania. The SOC stocks were obtained for eight WRB Reference Soil Groups to provide the estimates for land use, land-use change, and forestry reporting. The SOC stocks in the forest floor, topsoil of mineral, and peat layers were identified for soils under different land uses. The mean SOC concentrations in the 0-10 and 10-30 cm topsoil of most soil groups, especially fertile forest soils (Cambisols, Luvisols +Retisols) were higher for forest land and grasslands, and lower for croplands. The total averaged SOC stock in the forest floor in mineral and organic soils was 6.97 t ha(-1), whereas in the litter of grasslands it was 0.54 t ha(-1). The averaged SOC stock in topsoil varied from 56 t ha(-1) (Arenosols) to 118 t ha(-1) (Cambisols) in mineral forest soils and was 150 t ha(-1) (Histosols) in organic forest soils. The total averaged SOC stock in mineral topsoil of forest land, grassland, and cropland was 80, 74, and 72 t ha(-1), respectively.

DE Mursh; post-bog soils; gleysols; dewatering
AB Post-bog soils developed on carbonate sediments are closely related to a young-glacial landscape and postglacial lakes. Drainage of biogenic accumulation area leads to a series of transformations in accumulated formations, including the process of decession. The studies conducted in the years 2009-2012 were focused on post-bog soils near lakes: Strzeszowskie, Sitno and Drawskie in Western Pomerania. The examined soils belong to murshic soils and gleysols (The classification of Polish soils). Mursh horizons contained from 0.2 to 43.3% of carbonate and from 27.2 to 77.6% of non-carbonates fractions (Ncf), and varying amount of organic matter depending on the degree of mineralisation. Specific density of surface horizons was in the range from 1.76 to 2.33 Mg.m(-3), and bulk density from 0.28 to 0.68 Mg.m(-3). Higher porosity was found in mursh organic soils in comparison to gleysols. The studies showed that the content of carbonate fraction was related with specific density, bulk density, porosity and water capacity. Obtained results of physical and physico-chemical analysis indicate that dewatering depth of post-bog soils developed on limnic limestone are reflected in worsened water retention properties and reduced capillary ascent in the upper layers of carbonate formations of gleysols.

AB Although recent studies have recognized peatlands as a sink for atmospheric CO2, little is known about the role of Siberian peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We have estimated the Holocene peat and carbon accumulation rate in the peatlands of the southern taiga and subtaiga zones of western Siberia. We explain the accumulation rates by calculating the average peat accumulation rate and the long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) and by using the model of Clymo (1984, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B 303, 605-654). At three key areas in the southern taiga and subtaiga zones we studied eight sites, at which the dry bulk density, ash content, and carbon content were measured every 10 cm. Age was established by radiocarbon dating. The average peat accumulation rate at the eight sites varied from 0.35 +/- 0.03 to 1.13 +/- 0.02 mm yr(-1) and the LORCA values of bogs and fens varied from 19.0 +/- 1.1 to 69.0 +/- 4.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The accumulation rates had different trends especially during the early Holocene, caused by variations in vegetation succession resulting in differences in peat and carbon accumulation rates. The indirect effects of climate change through local hydrology appeared to be more important than direct influences of changes in precipitation and temperature. River valley fens were more drained during wetter periods as a result of deeper river incision, while bogs became wetter. From our dry bulk density results and our age-depth profiles we conclude that compaction is negligible and decay was not a relevant factor for undrained peatlands. These results contribute to our understanding of the influence of peatlands on the global carbon cycle and their potential impact on global change. (C) 2003 University of Washington.

AB PurposeThe main objectives of this work were the following: (1) to investigate the applicability of orange peel hydrochar as a soil amendment for improving the physical properties of a compacted, clay soil and (2) to study the growth of maize on substrates composed of clay soil and hydrochar and determine any potential phytotoxic effects.MethodsThe effect on soil's bulk density (BD), aeration, water holding capacity (WHC), and hydraulic conductivity were examined with hydrochar additions of 5, 10 and 15% (w/w) and determined by conventional laboratory methods. Potential phytotoxic effects were determined through the Zucconi germination index on fresh, diluted and 4-week old undiluted hydrochar extracts. The effect of hydrochar on maize growth was studied in clay soil (as reference), clay soil with 5% (w/w) fresh hydrochar, clay soil with 5% (w/w) of 4-week-old hydrochar and clay soil with 5% (w/w) biochar (for comparison).ResultsAt an application rate of 5% (w/w) hydrochar, the bulk density was reduced from 1.35 to 1.22 g/cm(3), the air-filled porosity was increased from 33 to 37% and the saturated hydraulic conductivity from 0.96 to 1.01 cm/h. The water holding capacity remained practically unchanged, however it was considerably reduced at higher application rates. The seed germination test indicated strong phytotoxicity of the fresh, undiluted hydrochar extract, which was reduced when the extract was diluted or the hydrochar allowed to mature for 4 weeks. The pot tests indicated that hydrochar did not improve the yield of maize, probably due to the presence of phytotoxic substances.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated a new valorization pathway for a significant agricultural waste. Additionally, it proved the applicability of orange peel hydrochar for improving the physical properties of clay soil. However, due to phytotoxic effects, further work is required before a field application is considered.

AB The past decade has seen a rapid increase in interest in the biogeochemical record preserved in peat, particularly as it relates to carbon dynamics and environmental change. Importantly, recent studies show that carbon dynamics, that is, organic matter decomposition, can influence the record of atmospherically derived elements such as halogens and mercury. Most commonly, bulk density, light transmission, or carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios are used as a proxy to qualitatively infer the degree of decomposition in peat, but do these three proxies reflect the same patterns? Furthermore, how do each of these proxies relate to other geochemical data? To address these questions, we analyzed bulk density, light transmission, and C/N ratios, as well as multielement geochemistry (wavelength-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF)), in three hummock cores (70 cm in length, c. 500 years) from an ombrotrophic Swedish bog. To compare the proxies, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to identify how the proxies relate to and interact with the geochemical matrix. This was coupled with changepoint modeling to identify and compare statistically significant changes for each proxy. Our results show differences between the proxies within and between cores, indicating each responds to a different part of the decomposition process. This is supported by the PCA, where the three proxies fall on different principal components. Changepoint analysis also showed that the inferred number of changepoints and their depths vary for each proxy and core. This suggests that decomposition is not fully captured by any one of these commonly used proxies, and thus, more than one proxy should be included.

AB Organic soils in peatlands store a great proportion of the global soil carbon pool and can lose carbon via the atmosphere due to degradation. In Germany, most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from organic soils are attributed to sites managed as grassland. Here, we investigated a land use gradient from near-natural wetland (NW) to an extensively managed (GE) to an intensively managed grassland site (GI), all formed in the same bog complex in northern Germany. Vertical depth profiles of delta C-13, delta N-15, ash content, C / N ratio and bulk density as well as radiocarbon ages were studied to identify peat degradation and to calculate carbon loss. At all sites, including the near-natural site, delta C-13 depth profiles indicate aerobic decomposition in the upper horizons. Depth profiles of delta N-15 differed significantly between sites with increasing delta N-15 values in the top soil layers paralleling an increase in land use intensity owing to differences in peat decomposition and fertilizer application. At both grassland sites, the ash content peaked within the first centimetres. In the near-natural site, ash contents were highest in 10-60 cm depth. The ash profiles, not only at the managed grassland sites, but also at the near-natural site indicate that all sites were influenced by anthropogenic activities either currently or in the past, most likely due to drainage. Based on the enrichment of ash content and changes in bulk density, we calculated the total carbon loss from the sites since the peatland was influenced by anthropogenic activities. Carbon loss at the sites increased in the following order: NW< GE< GI. Radiocarbon ages of peat in the topsoil of GE and GI were hundreds of years, indicating the loss of younger peat material. In contrast, peat in the first centimetres of the NW was only a few decades old, indicating recent peat growth. It is likely that the NW site accumulates carbon today but was perturbed by anthropogenic activities in the past. Together, all biogeochemical parameters indicate a degradation of peat due to (i) conversion to grassland with historical drainage and (ii) land use intensification.

AB A neural network model was trained to predict soil organic matter content, bulk density and soil organic matter density at different soil profile depths across Scotland. These predictions were then used to predict soil organic carbon content. The data used to train the model was developed from the National Soil Inventory of Scotland (NSIS) datasets, along with spatial datasets for topographic and climatic variables, and for geology, soil type and land cover. The trained network was tested and found to explain 79.8% of the variance in organic matter content, 77.9% of the variance in bulk density and 573% of the variance in profile depth. Various statistical measures were used to evaluate the predictive ability of the model, showing that it was suitable for predicting the carbon stocks of soils. The neural network model was used to make predictions from the surface to 1 m in 1 cm intervals, at 100 m spatial resolution, across Scotland. This allowed us to make a prediction of the distribution, spatially and at depth, of carbon stocks to 1 m across Scotland and to make estimates of the total carbon stock of Scottish soils (2954 Tg) and the amount stored in different soil types across the country. We found that our estimate of the amount of carbon stored in Scottish soils was in agreement with previous estimates. Mineral and organo-mineral soils are predicted to hold a large amount of carbon in the upper portion, and in terms of carbon stock are almost as important as peat soils. At increased depth, a much smaller proportion of the total Scottish soil carbon stock is held in soils not classified as organic. We provide information about the distribution of carbon stocks with depth and soil type and under different land use/land cover types. Finally, we discuss the relevance of this information in relation to efforts to store carbon within Scottish soils in the medium to long term. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents equations for estimating soil hydraulic properties such as bulk density (Db), field capacity (FC), permanent wilting point (PWP), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) from soil composition (sand, silt, clay, organic matter, coarse fragments), and with increasing soil depth, for a wide range of natural soil types and conditions. The equations, derived from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia soil survey reports, were evaluated and extended to international databases, e.g., ISRIC (Db, FC, PWP) and UNSODA (K-sat). Equation derivation was guided by theoretical considerations and regression techniques, to generate realistic Db, FC, PWP and K-sat values with sand, clay, organic matter content and soil depth as the only predictor variables, each with low inter-coefficient correlations. The results ensure that Db <= Dp (soil particle density), FC <= SP(soil saturation point), PWP <= FC, and Db, FC, PWP, K-sat > 0. The best-fitted Db, FC, PWP, log(10)(K-sat), data variations are represented as follows: R-2 = 0.83, 0.96, 0.65 and 0.79, respectively. In addition, the associated root-mean-square-residuals are similar to published values achieved with other approaches. The equations can be used to quantify expected changes in available soil water, Db, FC, PWP, log(10)(K-sat), and with varying organic matter content and texture. Examining the ISRIC data revealed systematic coefficient variations for the Db equation by soil order. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ant nests covered 0.09, 0.07, and 0.02% of the areas of the respective habitats. Changes within ant nests included reduction of soil bulk density by 29%-36% and of soil moisture by 2%-17%, and also an increase in microfloral abundance and enzymatic activity. Organic matter in ant nests contained more nitrogen but it was mineralized at a lower rate. Changes in the soil properties of ant nests as compared with the surrounding soil were significantly influenced by the size of ant colonies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Peatland restoration has been attracting increasing attention and implementation since large areas of peatlands in China have been degraded or reclaimed to cropland in recent decades. However, the length of time for cultivated peatland to be restored to natural climax level in terms of vegetation remained unknown. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the characteristics of hydrology, plant community, and soil in abandoned 0-, 2-, 15-, and 30-year-old paddy lands and a natural peatland. The results showed a long-term rise in water level after restoration. Similarity indexes between restored sites and natural peatland also increased with the extension of restoration time. During the first three years after abandonment, weeds grew vigorously and almost overtook the entire experimental site. However, the plant community was dominated by a Carex schmidtii-Phragmites australis-Thelypteris palustris community, where similarity increased to 64% and vegetation succession approached a natural climax community after 15 years of restoration. Compared with the paddy field, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic matter (TOM) in the soil at 0-30 cm depth and soil bulk density at 0-60 cm showed no significant change after 2 years of restoration. In the 15-year restoration site, however, TN and TOM at 0-30 cm increased by 108% and 86%, respectively (P < 0.01), and soil bulk density at 0-60 cm decreased by 40% compared with the paddy field (P < 0.05), and the values were already similar to the 30-year site and the natural peatland. Those findings indicate that the cultivated peatland could be restored effectively through natural succession. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT AND CULTIVATION ON PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES OF PEAT
   SOILS IN NEW-ZEALAND
SO GEODERMA
LA English
DT Article
ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; MINNESOTA
AB The effect of development and cultivation on the physical properties of two peat soils formed from restiad/sedge and sphagnum peat and developed for agriculture in the Hauraki Plains, New Zealand is reported by comparing physical properties of the plough layer (0-15 cm) and the relatively unaffected underlying peat (15-40 cm). Drainage and cultivation reduced soil moisture content, increased bulk density and reduced organic matter content. Bulk density was correlated with organic matter content only for the plough layer and indicates that bulk density alone is not a good indicator of decomposition in weakly decomposed peat soils in this region. Moisture retention curves indicated that a large amount of the water in the soil could not be removed at high suctions (up to 65% of the water was retained at suctions of 1500 kPa) and may cause moisture stress for plants, particulary in the plough layer of sphagnum peat, despite the high water content of the soil. This has important implications for maintaining a water table which maintains an adequate available water content for plants in the unsaturated zone immediately above the water table.
   Hydraulic conductivity differed between peat types in both the plough layer and the underlying peat. The presence of a root layer at 35-40 cm in the restiad/sedge peat was considered to substantially influence the readings and has important implications for drainage design in the soil.
   A simple method for measuring shrinkage in peat soils which involves coating natural clods in a saran resin is presented. A shrinkage curve indicated that shrinkage in peat is directly related to the gravimetric water content and does not contain zones of residual or structural shrinkage which are often associated with mineral soils. It is suggested, therefore, that a simple linear model based upon normal shrinkage will successfully predict volume changes associated with drainage of peat soils for agriculture.

AB Freshwater wetlands provide a range of ecosystem services, one of which is climate regulation. They are known to contain large pools of carbon (C) that can be affected by land-use change. In New Zealand, only 10 % of the original freshwater wetlands remain due to conversion into agriculture. This study presents the first national estimation of C stocks in freshwater wetlands based on the compilation of soil carbon data from 126 sites across the country. We estimated C stocks for two soil sample types (mineral and organic) in different classes of wetlands (fen, bog, swamp, marsh, pakihi and ephemeral), and extrapolated C stocks to national level using GIS. Bogs had high C content and low bulk densities, while ephemeral wetlands were the reverse. A regression between bulk density and C content showed a high influence of the soil type. Average C densities (average +/- A standard error) were 1,348 +/- A 184 t C ha(-1) at full peat depth (average of 3.9 m) and 102 +/- A 5 t C ha(-1) (0.3 m depth) for organic soils, and 121 +/- A 24 t C ha(-1) (0.3 m depth) for mineral soils. At national level, C stocks were estimated at 11 +/- A 1 Mt (0.3 m depth) and 144 +/- A 17 Mt (full peat depth) in organic soils, and 23 +/- A 1 Mt (0.3 m depth) in mineral soils. Since European settlement, 146,000 ha of organic soils have been converted to agriculture, which could release between 0.5 and 2 Mt CO2 year(-1), equivalent to 1-6 % of New Zealand's total agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Results are presented for soils take from twelve peatland sites in Ireland. Two depth horizons, 0-5 and 5-15 cm, were sampled on each site and sampling was carried out in summer and autumn. Deposition of Chernobyl Cs-137 varied between 0.4 and 4.6 kBq m-2, which is at the lower end of values reported by other authors for Irish agricultural Soils. The data showed that the relative percentages of activity and deposition remained internally consistent in each soil horizon for Chernobyl and weapons fallout sources on both sampling occasions: this provided evidence that sampling and analytical procedures were consistent. An apparent reversal in the relative importance of weapons fallout in soils was found when deposition data were compared to the same data presented in activity format, and this same reversal was found for both soil horizons. Different conclusions may erroneously be drawn from data depending on the parameter by which we make measurements. Presentation of results should be carefully considered and depends on the purpose for which a study is intended. A statistically significant change in bulk density of the deeper soil horizon was found between summer and autumn. Changes in bulk density resulted in a significant difference in deposition values between summer and autumn recorded for the 5-15 cm soil horizons. Such variability should be considered when transfer parameters are being derived for soil-plan-animal uptake studies.

AB The quality of growth substrate, assigned to the production of above ground plants, is dependent in particular for its physicochemical composition. For better optimization of the composition, a direct assessment was dedicated to a set of growth substrates, peat in mixture with basic and refined poultry methacompost (PMC), with or without the addition of forestry raw compost (FRC). Growth substrates undergo some physicochemical analysis (bulk density, total porosity, pH, electrical conductivity, salinity, organic matter, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N, levels of certain minerals). The tested substrates have revealed a wide bulk density, but meeting the required standards, good total porosity for blends made with the descending PMC incorporation rate, an acidic pH and electrical conductivity in the low overall. The PMC has been very rich in nitrogen and high in minerals (P, Ca and Na). Such characteristics indicate that incorporation with peat in a proportion of 10 to 20% might be possible, taking the necessary cautions.

AB The Agricultural employment of digestates from biomethanation can be used as an alternative to peat. The solid digestate poultry (called Poultry Methacompost: PMC) can be used as a partial substitute in the manufacture of culture substrates. The humified Organic Matter (OM) of mature substrates can be adopted only with the presence of necessary conditions for the development of the plant especially: respect of pH, percentage favorable of aeration, good sanitation, balanced contents of minerals. The present work aims to evaluate three different PMC from an industrial biomethaniser; one is obtained from the digester and the other two from the decanter (during two different periods). It appears from the physico-chemical characterization undertaken the following key results: In general, the PMC has a high bulk density, insufficient porosity of aeration, while the porosity of retention largely meets the standard. The phosphor and potassium are also eligible. The warranty of quality of PMC ensures greater acceptability and facilitates the incorporation with peat for soilless horticultural plants.

AB Extensive pipeline and railway corridors crossing Canadian peatlands make them vulnerable to hydrocarbon spills, potentially impairing ecosystem health, so it is important to be able to forecast hydrocarbon fate and transport within and beyond the peatland. The redistribution of hydrocarbon liquids in groundwater systems are controlled by the multiphase flow characteristics of the aquifer material including capillary pressure-saturation relative permeability (P-c-S-k(r)) relations. However, these relations have never been characterized for the hydrocarbon-water phases in peat. To address this, the flow and transport of diesel and water in peat soils were examined through a number of one dimensional vertical immiscible displacement tests, in which diesel was percolated into peat pore space displacing peat water, leading to a two-phase flow regime. Inverse modelling simulations using both Brooks and Corey's and power law relative permeability models, matched the data of the immiscible displacement tests well. Irreducible water saturation (S-wirr) and the curvature of water relative permeability relation increased with peat bulk density. The residual diesel saturation (S-Nr) ranged between 0.3% and 17% and increased with bulk density of peat. In a given peat, S-Nr was a function of saturation history and increased with increasing maximum diesel saturation. The receding contact angles of water in water-air systems and diesel in diesel-air systems, respectively, were 51.7 degrees and 61.2 degrees, showing that the wetting tendency of peat in the air imbibition condition is toward the draining liquid. These experiments advance our knowledge on the behavior of hydrocarbons in peat, and can improve numerical modelling of hydrocarbon transport after a spill.

AB Biochar is the solid, carbon-rich product resulting from the pyrolysis of biomass in the absence of oxygen. We are examining biochars for several horticultural applications, including as a replacement for peat moss in soilless substrates used in the production of containerized greenhouse and nursery crops. Biochars were prepared from hardwood pellets and from pelletized wheat straw. Straw biochar had a higher potassium content and pH than the wood biochar. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses of the biochars showed much greater volatile content in the straw biochar. Both biochars had significantly higher bulk densities than either peat moss or vermiculite. Substituting biochar pellets (at rates of 5%, 10%, and 15%, v/v) for peat moss increased substrate pHs, bulk densities, and electrical conductivities, while having variable effects on physical properties (air porosities, container capacities, and total porosities). Greenhouse experiments were conducted using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L) and marigold (Tagetes erecta L) plants grown in 3.0-L pots. Addition of either biochar had no effect on dry weights of tomato plants after 4 weeks of growth, but significantly increased plant heights in all treatments. Marigold plant heights were greater than the control in all but the 5% wood biochar, but had only a minor effect on plant dry weights. These results indicate that both pelletized biochars would be suitable as replacements for peat in soilless substrates when used at these replacement rates. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Since large areas of peatlands in China have been degraded or reclaimed to cropland in recent decades, the conversion of these croplands to wetlands and the restoration of degraded peatlands by means of engineering have been attracting increasing attention. Hydrologic mediation and plantation of dominant peatland species were implemented to determine the effects of these two artificial measures on revegetation and soil property improvement in paddy fields in the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China. The results showed that after a three-year restoration, compared to natural restoration treatment, planting of Carex schmidtii significantly reduced aboveground biomass by 45% (p < 0.05), increased root biomass by 53% (P < 0.05), increased the Shannon-Wiener Index by 17%, enhanced concentrations of total soil organic matter by 28% (P < 0.05), reduced topsoil bulk density by 40% (P < 0.05), and improved water retention capacity of the topsoil. These results demonstrate the ability of C. schmidtii to inhibit the growth of weeds and other nontarget species through competition, and to increase the amount of residual roots in soil due to its well-developed rhizomes. Aboveground biomass and total organic matter in hydrologic mediation were 38% lower and 37% higher than in the natural restoration treatment, respectively. However, annual precipitation in this area is 704.2 mm, higher than most other area in Northeast China, and the Shannon-Wiener Index and soil bulk density were 4% and 29% lower than in the natural restoration treatment, respectively. Furthermore, the combined application of these two measures resulted in 35% lower aboveground biomass, 22% higher Shannon-Wiener Index, 16% higher topsoil organic matter, and 27% lower bulk density than in the natural restoration treatment. However, the growth of C. schmidtii was inhibited due to the reduction in its survival rate and basal width growth rate. Our results suggest that planting C. schmidtii is an effective way to promote the restoration of degraded peatland and enhance its carbon sink function in the Changbai Mountains. On the other hand, implementation of hydrologic mediation is not recommended for this rain-rich region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes an experiment which was carried out at a landfill site in north Lincolnshire to investigate the use of biosolids and other organic materials in soil formation. The following organic amendments were incorporated into the surface of the on-site geological clay to form 'topsoil' treatments: (i) nil, (ii) biosolids (digested cake), (iii) waste peat/compost, and (iv) composted green waste. The biosolids were applied at a rate of 70 tDS/ha and all the organic materials were incorporated to a depth of 150 mm. The organic amendments reduced the topsoil bulk density and increased plant available water supply and soil water infiltration rates. Topsoil organic matter, total nitrogen and extractable phosphorus concentrations, biomass nitrogen, readily mineralisable organic nitrogen and soil respiration rates were also increased. Additionally, the biosolids application increased topsoil aggregate stability and soil surface strength.

AB Physicochemical traits of peat-based pot substrates prepared from mixing of 20 or 40 vol.% of some different mineral fractions (sub. 1 to 7, subjected to decreasing amount of clay content of 66.1, 61.2, 49.7, 38.5, 26.0, 23.7 and 19.4%, respectively) with black peat were evaluated and then phosphorus uptake of poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherima) simulated mechanistically as a case study pot plant. For preparation of substrate number 8, pure peat was mixed with 40 vol.% of the same mineral component as substrate number 6 (with 23.7% clay). Result revealed that adding different mineral fractions up to 40 vol.% to pure peat, water-holding capacity and total pore volume were reduced only by 11 and 15 vol.%, respectively. It was found that keeping the moisture content of peat-based substrates with 20 vol.% of mineral soils around 60%-70%, the optimum ventilation and enough free space of about 15%-25% will be provided around the root system. In addition, simulated P uptake did not change significantly with addition of 20 vol.% of different mineral components in peat-based substrates. As a result, P uptake mainly was dependent on the amount of plant available P level than different mineral fractions.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine peat formation processes throughout the millennia in four tidal marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Peat cores collected at each site were analyzed for bulk density, loss on ignition, and percent organic carbon. Core data and spline fit age-depth models were used to estimate inorganic sedimentation, organic accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates in the marshes. Bulk density and percent organic matter content of peat fluctuated through time at all sites, suggesting that peat formation processes are dynamic and responsive to watershed conditions. The balance between inorganic sedimentation and organic accumulation at the sites also varied through time, indicating that marshes may rely more strongly on either inorganic or organic matter for peat formation at particular times in their existence. Mean carbon sequestration rates found in this study (0.38-0.79 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) were similar to other long-term estimates for temperate peatlands.

AB Freshwater tropical wetlands are valuable sinks of carbon (C) on the global scale. While much attention has been paid to forested peatlands, little is known about C stored in tropical freshwater mineral soil wetlands dominated by herbaceous and macrophyte vegetation, specially its spatial variability at the ecosystem level. Here we study the soil organic carbon of two tropical lowland wetlands (fluvial and isolated), located in the interandean valley of the Magdalena river in Colombia. Soil cores were extracted from 11 sampling zones distributed in the two wetlands, including the dryland adjacent to each wetland. They were sectioned into 2 cm-depth increments that were analyzed for C content. The average bulk density was higher (P < 0.001) in the fluvial wetland (0.87 +/- 0.3 g cm(-3)) than in the isolated one (0.45 +/- 0.3 g cm(-3)), the concentration of C (% Cr) was higher (P < 0.001) in the isolated wetland (11.1 +/- 6.8%) than in the fluvial one (1.9 +/- 1.1%) as well as the average soil organic carbon (6.4 +/- 2.6 and 2.9 +/- 1.1 t C ha(-1) cm(-1), respectively). Per unit area, the fluvial wetland had about twice as much storage capacity of C as the dryland, while in the isolated wetland the ratio was up to five times higher. Hydrogeomorphology was an important factor for the C storage in these ecosystems. The fluctuating hydrodynamics of the fluvial wetland seems to favor aerobic conditions and thus the prevalence of aerobic over anaerobic decomposition, lowering accumulation of C. This study makes an important contribution towards the understanding of C dynamics in different types of tropical wetlands and brings data to support their conservation.

ID LOCAL-UNEMPLOYMENT; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; DISTRIBUTED LAGS; WATER; SOIL
AB The relationship between peat hydrophysical properties and solute transfer to drainage ditches was examined for a pump-drained soligenous valley fen in SW England.  Drainage increased the bulk density and lowered the hydraulic conductivity of the peat, to the extent that, water table drawdown could not be detected beyond 5 m from the drainage ditch or field drains.  The water table drawdown zone acted as the source of solutes transfered to the drainage ditch on pumping.  A distinct solute release sequence was recorded in the drainage ditch, with SO4-S peaking before NH4-N, which was followed by Ca, Mg and NO3-N.  Ca and Mg release was delayed by up two days following a pump event.  Solute concentrations in pump-drained ditches were significantly higher than those of drainage channels unaffected by pumping.  Solute transfer from the peat as a result of pump drainage, has resulted in water quality deterioration within the peatland.

AB A bovine manure compost (BMC) and a green compost (GC) were evaluated as components of substrates in partial substitution of peat for organic melon seedlings production. Treatments, differentiated on the basis of the volume percentage of the two analysed composts, were compared to the control (a mixture of peat, coconut fibre and perlite). In order to respect the guidelines of organic production, all the treatments were fertilised, at the beginning of the trial, with guano. Compost-based substrates were analysed for physical, physicochemical and chemical parameters (bulk density, porosity, pH, EC, nutrients content etc.). even though significant differences were observed, recorded values were in the range of acceptability for growing media. In terms of performance, seedling growth in treatments containing 30% and 50% of composts was significantly higher than in control.

AB Pure Sphagnum peat is known for its good physical and chemical properties for growing container seedlings. However, it may not always provide the optimal water and aeration conditions for container seedlings raised on open fields especially during rainy summers, when waterlogging may occur. An excess water content in the growth medium favours fungal root infections as the infection by the root dieback pathogen Ceratobasidium bicorne. The use of perlite and mineral sand in formulating growth media mixtures has been in common use for a long time. Recently, use of composts in growth media mixtures has increasingly gained ground because of environmental interests to recycle organic wastes. Compost microflora might also decrease the growth of root pathogens. In this study, these additives were used in peat medium to produce different physical properties and conditions for testing their effect on root dieback and seedling growth.
   Scots pine and Norway spruce seedlings were grown from seed in separate containers in a greenhouse in central Finland. In the first experiment containers were filled with light, low-humified Sphagnum peat or mixtures of peat and coarse perlite and/or fine quartz sand. The experiment was repeated with an additional treatment of composted forest nursery waste as a component in the growth medium. When the seedlings were two month old, a part of them were inoculated with C. bicorne. The seedlings were examined at the end of the first growing seasons and in the following springs.
   The amendments altered the physical properties of the Sphagnum peat. The organic matter content of all the mixtures was lower, and the bulk density higher, than the corresponding values for pure peat. The addition of quartz sand especially increased the bulk density of the growth media. The total porosity and water retention capacity of the peat and peat-compost were higher than those of the perlite or/and quartz sand-mixtures. However, the study showed that none of the growth media limited the pathogenicity of C. bicorne under normal irrigation practice.

AB The study proposed to use X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) alongside destructive method for assessing tomato seedling soil substrate and agronomic properties and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for substrate-root elemental composition analysis. Three growth media having sphagnum peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite were mixed in percentage proportions of 60:20:20, 60:40:0, and 60:0:40 for substrate 1 (S1), substrate 2 (S2), and substrate 3 (S3), respectively. Results from the X-ray CT showed mean range of porosity for S1, S2, and S3 as 17.8% to 24.7%, 40% to 52.8%, and 11.3% to 14.2%, respectively. Finite element simulation performed on the X-ray CT scans also showed the maximum von-Mises stress distribution and stiffness to be greater in S1 followed by S2 and S3. Using the destructive method for measuring agronomic properties indicated that increasing bulk densities (0.28, 0.32, and 0.36 gcm(-3)) negatively affected root length in S2 and S3. Also, at 0.28 gcm-3, the highest root volume especially in S1 and S2 were recorded. Lastly, SEM-EDS analysis indicated that O, Si, N, P, K, Fe, and Mg present were significantly greater in S1 than S2 and S3. In all, the study suggests that the composition of sphagnum peat, perlite, and vermiculite in the proportion of 60:20:20 produces quality tomato seedlings.

ID TABLE
AB Hydrologic drainage criteria that describe the position of the water table between adjacent ditches are commonly used to assess the initial effectiveness of peatland drainage projects for tree growth improvement. However, these criteria do not reflect the soil conditions that regulate tree growth and performance after drainage. The effect of three drainage ditch spacings (30, 40, and 50 m) on the spatial variability of soil water conditions at three drained boreal Alberta peatlands was studied. Soil water content (0-30 cm depth) was found to be insensitive (p = 0.686) to drainage ditch spacing several years after drainage. Greater variation was observed between different sampling locations (p = 0.024) relative to the position of the ditch edge within similar ditch spacings. Spatial distribution of soil water in the unsaturated zone was found to be inversely related to the degree of water table lowering. Spatial patterns of soil water content were strongly associated with changes to substrate bulk density resulting from postdrainage peatland subsidence.

AB This paper quantified the soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, bulk density, depth and carbon (C) stocks of 24 afforested peatlands. We found that the peat bulk density does not increase with depth, as has been previously noted in the literature. The depths of each different peat type were found to vary widely with means of 192 +/- 100, 145 +/- 130 and 127 +/- 100 cm for raised bogs (RB), high-level blanket bog (HLB) and low-level blanket bog (LLB), respectively. Based on the full-surveyed depth, we estimated carbon densities of: 1160 +/- 520 Mg C ha(-1) for RB peat; 775 +/- 590 Mg C ha(-1) for HLB peat and 705 +/- 420 Mg C ha(-1) for LLB peat. We found peat depth and peat type to be significant predictors of peat carbon density and present pedo-transfer functions for carbon density based on these predictors that will help to improve future peat C stock estimates. We suggest that due to the similarities between the carbon densities of the HLB and LLB, they can be analysed as one group for accounting purposes and future C stock estimates.

AB Industrial activities for resource extraction have led to a network of seismic lines across Canada's boreal regions where peatlands often make up over 50% of the landscape. These clearings can have a significant influence on ecosystem functioning through vegetation removal, flattening of microtopography, altering hydrological pathways, and impacting biogeochemical processes. Recently, there has been a concerted effort to restore seismic lines to bring back the localized microtopography and encourage ecosystem recovery. A common restoration approach on seismic lines is mounding, which involves using machinery to recreate natural microtopography. Research is scarce on the impact on soil properties following both these disturbances and subsequent restoration on organic soils. The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between areas disturbed by seismic lines and adjacent natural areas and (2) determine changes to soil physical and chemical properties following the mounding restoration technique. Research was undertaken at two contrasting boreal ecosites (a poor mesic and a treed fen) near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. In July 2018, we collected soil samples at 34 seismic line locations, both on the line and 20 m into the adjacent undisturbed area. Samples were analyzed for bulk density, volumetric water content (VWC), organic matter (OM) content, C:N ratios, and delta C-13/delta N-15 isotope analysis. Seismic line disturbances had a significant impact on soil properties, with increased bulk density and VWC on the line at both ecosites. We found an almost 40% reduction in OM on the line compared to natural areas at the poor mesic site, implying changes to carbon cycling, increased mineralization rates, and carbon loss from the system. There was also delta C-13/delta N-15 enrichment and narrower C:N ratios on the line, indicating increased decomposition. We found evidence of increased decomposition on the mounds created after restoration at the treed fen. Our results highlight a trade-off between restoration activities that may encourage recovery but also cause increased carbon losses from the system. This research is a first step in gaining a better understanding of these impacts in light of current restoration practices to ensure best management practices for improving ecosystem functioning.

AB The relative abundance of species of testate amoebae (Testacea; Rhizopoda) was established from 107 surface moss samples from a forested peatland in northeastern Ontario. These were related by multivariate analysis to a number of microenvironmental conditions including soil moisture content, water table, bulk density, humification, dominant peat component, pH, peat depth, depth of living moss, dominant surface moss species, vegetation type, microtopographical position, and artificial drainage. Moisture conditions play a key role in determining the species assemblages, pH being a secondary factor. Other environmental parameters related to species assemblages do not necessarily indicate a direct ecological link but are also associated with moisture and nutrient conditions. Individual species are ranked in terms of their preferred moisture conditions and compared with data from Finland. Certain species are restricted to either dry or wet conditions while others tolerate a wide range of moisture. Calculating weighted averages of substrate moisture contents for a greater range of species sampled from a larger number of sites will allow the development of transfer functions for constructing palaeomoisture curves from peatlands.

AB The saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) is a key parameter in many hydrological and climate models. K-sat values are primarily determined from basic soil properties and may vary over several orders of magnitude. Despite the availability of K-sat datasets in the literature, significant efforts are required to combine the data before they can be used for specific applications. In this work, a total of 13 258 K-sat measurements from 1908 sites were assembled from the published literature and other sources, standardized (i.e., units made identical), and quality checked in order to obtain a global database of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (SoilKsatDB). The SoilKsatDB covers most regions across the globe, with the highest number of K-sat measurements from North America, followed by Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, and Australia. In addition to K-sat, other soil variables such as soil texture (11 584 measurements), bulk density (11 262 measurements), soil organic carbon (9787 measurements), moisture content at field capacity (7382), and wilting point (7411) are also included in the dataset. To show an application of SoilKsatDB, we derived K-sat pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for temperate regions and laboratory-based soil properties (sand and clay content, bulk density). Accurate models can be fitted using a random forest machine learning algorithm (best concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) equal to 0.74 and 0.72 for temperate area and laboratory measurements, respectively). However, when these K-sat PTFs are applied to soil samples obtained from tropical climates and field measurements, respectively, the model performance is significantly lower (CCC = 0.49 for tropical and CCC = 0.10 for field measurements). These results indicate that there are significant differences between K-sat data collected in temperate and tropical regions and K-sat measured in the laboratory or field. The SoilKsatDB dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3752721 (Gupta et al., 2020) and the code used to extract the data from the literature and the applied random forest machine learning approach are publicly available under an open data license.

AB Water table level control by drainage improves forested peatland sites for tree growth, but can also result in subsidence of the peatland surface. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of changes to peat bulk density associated with postdrainage subsidence on peat hydrologic properties at a peatland drained for forestry in north-central Alberta, Canada. Feat hydrologic functions were deter mined by inverse techniques developed for multistep outflow experiments (MULSTP). Se, cn years after drainage, mean peat bulk density (0-40-cm depth) was 63% greater and mean soil water retention (-5 to -15000 cm pressure head) was 66% greater than pear from the nearby undrained control area. Subsidence after drainage was associated with loss of pores >600-mu m diam. with concurrent increases in 3- to 30-mm-diam. pore-size classes, Mean saturated hydraulic conductivity was 1.69 and 14.46 cm h(-1), while mean unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (-5 to -15 000 rm pressure head) was 0.014 and 0.001 cm h(-1) in peat from drained and undrained areas, respectively. Changes in water transport characteristics and in the pool of "plant-available" soil water will probably be beneficial to tree growth in the drained area.

AB Green roofs are becoming increasingly common practice of the urban sustainable environment. The growing substrate is the most important part of green-roof technology. The cost of engineering substrates can be reduced by using locally available components. Since green roofs are a relatively new concept in Poland, there is a need to examine substrate compositions and characteristics, including commonly used ingredients as well as alternative recycled/waste materials. The aim of our study was to assess the ability of locally sourced waste materials as roof-growing media amendments. In the greenhouse experiment we tested two grass and herb species mixtures and four waste substrate formulas. The locally disposed waste materials used as components of growing media included silica wastes (byproducts of metallic ferrosilicon alloys), cellulose, foundry sand, and. organic waste material removed from the organic horizons of mucky peat. The engineered Si-waste substrates were compared with the commercially available media. The physico-chemical properties of components and substrates, their stability over time, and the influence on plant growth and mineral nutrient status were examined. Particle size distribution, bulk density, mass, water capacity, soil reaction, and total dissolved salt content of Si-waste-growing media were compatible with FLL standards. We found low amounts of available P and K, and high concentrations of Ca, Mg, S, and trace elements (with the exception of B) in Si-waste substrates in comparison with the control media. Silica waste materials have the potential to maintain pH with high buffering capacity. Engineered Si-waste substrates had a positive impact on plant growth and biomass. In general, these results indicate that contaminant elements contained in alkaline Si-waste substrates were not easily available to the root system, and consequently they did not restrict plant growth. We consider Si-wastes to be a valuable and environmentally responsible green roof media amendment.

AB River-sediment diversions have been recognized as a key strategy for offsetting land loss in coastal Louisiana. Recently, much attention has been focused on sediment capture from the main stem river and conveyance of that material through diversion outflows. Yet, the performance and long-term feasibility of diversions as land building agents also hinges upon the subsurface stratigraphic architecture of receiving basins, a concept that has largely been unexplored. A major core collection and analysis program was undertaken to study the geological properties of substrates in the Middle Barataria Bay and Middle Breton Sound diversion receiving basins, Louisiana, USA. Over a region of similar to 200 square kilometers in both basins, 50 vibracores up to 5.5 m in length were collected in spring and summer of 2015. Cores were logged for bulk density and imaged with a Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger. Split cores were then subsampled for granulometry, organic content, and C-14 dating. Both receiving basins are characterized by 1-2 m of organic-rich surficial strata, underlain by > 2 m of mineral rich sand and silt beds that display a greater bulk density. Additionally, some cores contain deeper peaty strata intercalated within muds and sands. C-14 dates of these buried peats range between 1910 and 3203 calendar years before present demonstrating that relatively old deltaic strata exist at shallow depths. Age comparisons of stratigraphically-similar peat beds from this study and previous delta-lobe chronological models indicate that the St. Bernard lobe prograded eastward at a time-averaged rate of 75 m/yr. From a geotechnical standpoint, the surficial, uncompacted (< 2 m depth, average 1.15 g/cc bulk density) peaty strata in both basins are likely to erode and/or compact under the influence of diversion flows, but deeper consolidated mineral-rich strata (average 1.85 g/cc bulk density) are likely to be more resistant. Hydrodynamic models that predict the erosion associated with river-sediment diversion outflows in this region would benefit from incorporating a two-layer subsurface configuration, with a weaker, peat-like layer overlying a stronger, mineral-rich layer. The results of our study suggest that regions with an abundance of clastic strata at depth should be sought out when planning coastal restoration methods such as river-sediment diversions.

AB Smoldering combustion of peat is of global concern as a natural hazard to consume sequestered carbon and form wide-area haze. It is affected by thermal decomposition kinetics of peat and the diffusion and availability of oxygen. In this work, thermal decomposition behavior of peat was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis under the atmosphere with different oxygen concentrations. The results showed that thermal decomposition process of peat could be divided into three stages: dehydration, oxidative pyrolysis of organic matters into volatiles and char, and oxidation of the generated char. The apparent activation energies of peat decomposition under different oxygen concentrations were calculated by model-free methods of Kissinger, FWO, Starink, Gyulai, and Friedman. A two-step reaction model was proposed to describe thermal decomposition kinetics of peat (excluding dehydration stage) and the effect of oxygen concentration on the kinetic parameters was discussed. These results provide basic data for smoldering modeling of peat.

AB The use of locally available materials that meet appropriate physicochemical characteristics represents an alternative to replace commercial substrates of high cost and negative environmental impact The objective was to characterize organic material mixtures that are available in Yucatan, Mexico, to identify their potential as substrates. Pine chips (VP) and raw sawdust (AP) were mixed with different percentages of henequen bagasse (BH) and coir dust (PC), as follows: 20BH+80AP; 30BH+70VP; 20PC+80AP; 20PC+80VP; 20PC+40AP+40VP; and 20BH+40AP+40VP. Additionally, a peat-based commercial substrate was used. Particle size, bulk density, total porosity, air-water relations, pH, electrical conductivity (CE), organic matter content, biological activity, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the N, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ content was measured. All the mixtures showed high total porosity. Those containing AP+PC had particle size and water retention capacity similar to the commercial substrate, and the 20PC+80AP and 20BH+40AP+40VP mixtures surpassed it in the percentage of total available water. The 30BH+70VP mixture was superior to all the mixes in the contents of N, P, K+,and Ca2(+). All the mixtures showed pH slightly higher than the recommended maximum limit (6.5), CE with values lower than 1.5 dS.m(-1), CEC with mid-levels (10 a 15 meq.100 g(-1)) and low CO2 production (3.5 to 4 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) that increased in the mixtures with BH up to 9.77 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) . Therefore, all mixtures have appropriate physical and chemical characteristics to consider them as alternatives for agricultural substrate.

TI Pedotransfer Functions of Soil Thermal Conductivity for the Textural

AB Data of soil thermal conductivity (lambda) covering the whole range of soil water content (theta) are needed in many environmental disciplines. However, laboratory measurements of l(theta) are time consuming and costly. Therefore the use of pedotransfer functions is promising. In this study, we describe the procedure of deriving such lambda(theta) pedotransfer functions for the FAO texture groups (TG) of Sand, Silt and Loam. First, high-resolution lambda(theta) measurements from saturation to dryness of 43 soils were conducted by two laboratory methods: the evaporation approach and single-point measurements of lambda at distinct water contents. Measurements were obtained for a set of sandy, silty, loamy, and clayey soils, and for two urban soils and two peat soils. The slope and magnitude of the lambda(theta) curves show typical dependencies on bulk density (p(b)) and soil texture. In a second step, the lambda(theta) data were used to evaluate the lambda(theta) model as suggested by Lu et al. (2014). Fitting this model to the complete data set yielded a poor agreement with RMSE = 0.53 W m(-1) K-1. However, satisfying results were obtained by dividing the data into TGs Sand, Silt and Loam resulting in RMSEs of 0.18, 0.11 and 0.24 W m(-1) K-1, respectively. Estimated lambda values at low soil moisture (wilting point) were hardly different among texture classes, but lambda differences become highly relevant when soil moisture increased to field capacity. The derived pedotransfer functions are an easy-touse approach providing reliable lambda(theta) curves for sandy, silty and loamy soils, when only basic soil information (texture and bulk density) are available.

TI Peatland initiation and carbon accumulation in the Falkland Islands

DE South Atlantic; Carbon accumulation; Bog; Peat; Holocene
ID AGE; DYNAMICS; STOCKS
AB The Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean contain extensive peatlands at the edge of their global climatic envelope, but the long-term carbon dynamics of these sites is poorly quantified. We present new data for ten sites, compile previously-published data and produce a new synthesis. Many peatlands in the Falkland Islands developed notably early, with a fifth of basal C-14 dates pre-Holocene. Falkland Islands peats have high ash content, high carbon content and high bulk density compared to global norms. In many sites carbon accumulation rates are extremely low, which may partly relate to low average rainfall, or to carbon loss through burning and aeolian processes. However, in coastal Tussac peatlands carbon accumulation can be extremely rapid. Our re-analysis of published data from Beauchene Island, the southernmost of the Falkland Islands, yields an exceptional long-term apparent carbon accumulation rate of 139 g C m(-2) yr(-1), to our knowledge the highest recorded for any global peatland. This high accumulation might relate to the combination of a long growing-season and marine nutrient inputs. Given extensive coverage and carbon-dense peats the carbon stock of Falkland Islands peatlands is clearly considerable but robust quantification will require the development of a reliable peat map. Falkland Island peatlands challenge many standard assumptions and deserve more detailed study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are highly valued for their range of ecosystem services, including distinctive biodiversity, agricultural uses, recreational amenities, water provision, river flow regulation and their capacity to store carbon. There have been a range of estimates of carbon stored in peatlands in the United Kingdom, but uncertainties remain, in particular with regard to depth and bulk density of peat. In addition, very few studies consider the full profile with depth in carbon auditing. The importance of sub-peat soils within peatland carbon stores has been recognized, but remains poorly understood and is included rarely within peatland carbon audits. This study examines the importance of the carbon store based on a study of blanket peat on Dartmoor, UK, by estimating peat depths in a 4x1km survey area using ground penetrating radar (GPR), extraction of 43 cores across a range of peat depth, and estimation of carbon densities based on measures of loss-on-ignition and bulk density. Comparison of GPR estimates of peat depth with core depths shows excellent agreement, to provide the basis for a detailed understanding of the distribution of peat depths within the survey area. Carbon densities of the sub-peat soils are on average 78 and 53kgC/m(3) for the overlying blanket peat. There is considerable spatial variability in the estimates of total carbon from each core across the survey area, with values ranging between 56.5kgC/m(2) (1.01m total depth of peat and soil) and 524kgC/m(2) (6.63m total depth). Sub-peat soil carbon represents between 4 and 28 per cent (mean 13.5) of the total carbon stored, with greater values for shallower peat. The results indicate a significant and previously unaccounted store of carbon within blanket peat regions which should be included in future calculations of overall carbon storage. It is argued that this store needs to be considered in carbon audits.

AB A peat core from an ombrotrophic mire in central Sweden was analysed for multi-proxy indicators (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, restate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk densities, loss on ignition), to evaluate the relative contributions of climate change and human impact on vegetation and peat accumulation during the last c. 350 years. C-14 wiggle-match daring was applied for high precision dating. Testate amoebae assemblages were used to reconstruct past water table depths and compared with other proxies and instrumental climate data from the mid-18th century onwards, Changes in mire surface wetness were mainly caused by climate change (precipitation and evaporation), but the internal dynamics of the local bog vegetation may also have played a role in the recorded water table changes. The human impact signal in the pollen data was compared with Swedish population and land-use data. A link between climate change, human impact (openness of the vegetation) and demographic change was found. Cold and wet periods show a decrease in human impact and open land indicators in the pollen data, followed by an increase in death rate and/or an increase in emigration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Engineering buildings and other structures such as dams and roadways require soil compaction during construction, so as to limit settling of structures after construction. Optimum water content that results in the maximum soil density is normally desired, so that compaction could be done at this water content. This has to be determined by prior laboratory soil tests usually carried out using the standard Proctor test. The design, construction and testing of a vibratory soil machine, which can produce densities and optimum moisture contents that would mimic the Proctor test is described. A mechanism was designed and developed that vibrated the soil at a given time, amplitude and frequency and resulted in compacting the soil. These factors were varied to determine the ideal parameters for operating the vibratory compactor. Results showed that soil densities increased with increasing sand contents in the soils, increasing amplitude, time and frequency of the machine. Results also showed that the vibratory soil compactor would work best at a frequency of 17 Hz and amplitude of 1.17 mm for five minutes. Soil was compacted in three layers. Further, it worked best in sandy soil producing about 98% of the maximum bulk density from the Proctor test and 97% and 96% for the clay loam and clay soils respectively. The major advantage of the constructed vibratory soil compaction equipment is that it would reduce the tedium involved in the standard Proctor soil compaction test. (C) 2018 IAgrE.

AB Measurements of the net methane exchange over a range of forest, moorland, and agricultural soils in Scotland were made during the period April to June 1994 and 1995. Fluxes of CH4 ranged from oxidation -12.3 to an emission of 6.8 ng m(-2) s(-1). The balance between CH4 oxidation and emission depended on the physical conditions of the soil, primarily soil moisture. The largest oxidation rates were found in the mineral forest soils, and CH4 emission was observed in several peat soils. The smallest oxidation rate was observed in an agricultural soil. The relationship between CH4 flux and soil moisture observed in pears (Flux(CH4) = 0.023 x %H2O (dry weight) - 7.44, p < 0.05) was such that CH4 oxidation was observed at soil moistures less than 325%(+/- 80%). CH4 emission was found at soil moistures exceeding this value. A large range of CH4 oxidation rates were observed over a small soil moisture range in the mineral soils. CH4 oxidation in mineral soils was negatively correlated with soil bulk density (Flux(CH4) = -37.35 x bulk density (g cm(-3)) +48.83, p < 0.05). Increased nitrogen loading of the soil due to N fixation, atmospheric deposition of N, and fertilisation, were consistently associated with decreases in the soil sink for CH4, typically in the range 50 to 80%, on a range of soil types and land uses.

Compared with mineral soils, our understanding of hydraulic properties of peat soils is limited, especially of the temporal dynamics of peat properties. A data set of peat subsidence as well as the bulk density (BD) change rate following artificial drainage was assembled from the literature. The collected data cover a time period of up to 272 years of land drainage for forestry and agriculture in boreal and temperate climate zones. The results show that the subsidence rate and BD change rate, and hydrophysical properties of peat can be estimated based on land drainage duration and land use. The most severe shift in pore structure of peat occurs within the first 20 years of land drainage. Peatland drainage reduces macroporosity with pore diameter greater than 50 mu m, but increases the volume of pores <5 mu m. In the long term, peat thickness loss is responsible for more than 80% of water storage loss. In conclusion, the derived functions between subsidence rate, BD change rate, and drainage duration provide a new approach to estimate the hydrophysical properties of peat (pore structure, saturated hydraulic conductivity, specific yield, and soil water storage) on a centennial scale. The derived hydrophysical parameter values can be used for long-term hydrological modeling, especially if measured hydraulic parameters of peat are not available.

AB The characteristics of peat can be explained by its degree of decomposition (H), dry bulk density (D-BD), air (A(V)) and water (W-V) volumes, total pore space (P-S), ash and organic carbon contents, C/N ratio, elemental as well as the botanical composition. This study includes results of 20 horticultural peats obtained from different areas of Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden. The tested peats had a decomposition degree of H3 to H7 and Sphagnum (peat moss) was identified as the major peat forming plant genus (35-90 %) followed by Carex (5-50 %) and mixture of Eriophorum and woody plant remains (5-20 %). The mean DBD and P-S varied widely from 40 to 141 g L-1 and 87.4 to 96.6 % v/v, respectively. Although the tested peats had substantial amounts of W-V (43.3 to 82.1 % v/v), their mean water buffering capacities were low (<8 % of W-V) to suggest that these peats cannot deliver enough water to the cultivated plant once the easily available water (water held between -1 and -5 kPa; 17.2 to 42.3 % v/v) is gone. Mineral contents (NH4-N, NO3-N, P, Mg, K, Ca, Mn and Fe) in most peats were considerably low but the computed resource availability indices (C/N, C/P, N/P and N/K) were quite high. The variability of nearly 30 parameters, describing the properties of peat, was examined using a Principal Component Analysis and factors relevant to the first two principal components are discussed in details.

AB Wetland condition can be severely altered as a result of a change in hydrology. In this study, we examined several soil-based methods to quantify and assess changes in salt marsh condition as a result of tidal restriction. Soil properties were compared between two tidally restricted and two (paired) unrestricted salt marshes. Organic horizon morphology provided a qualitative metric of marsh peat decomposition. Quantitative measures of the degree of decomposition included stable plant fragment content and bearing capacity. Soil pH provided simple metrics of changes in soil chemistry. Bulk density was measured to estimate marsh peat collapse and soil organic matter content provided a measure of carbon dynamics. Neither marsh showed significant differences in soil organic matter or bulk density relative to their paired reference marsh. In contrast, soil pH, stable plant fragment content, and bearing capacity were significantly different between restricted and reference marshes. With the exception of incubation pH, these soil properties can be simply and rapidly measured in the field to quantify physical, chemical, and biological changes in the wetland condition of salt marshes as a result of tidal restriction. Further studies should be conducted to develop a rapid protocol for measuring incubation pH in the field.

AB The experiment was carried on a clay loam soil to examine the short-term effects of hazelnut husk compost (HHC) and organic amendments on selected soil physical properties between 2001 and 2003. The amendments were only applied in 2001. The experimental design was replicated five times as a randomized complete block with four organic amendments: HHC, peat, farmyard manure (FM), chicken manure (CM) and soil (control). Amendments were applied at rates of 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 75 and 100 tons ha(-1) (dry weight) replicated. The effect on the soil's physical properties such as bulk density, water retention characteristics, pore ratio, structural stability, and soil organic carbon were determined. All amendments and their rates had a positive effect on the physical properties of the soil. HHC decreased the bulk density of soil. The effect depended on year since application. Moreover, HHC increased soil total porosity, the amount of water held at field capacity and willing point of soil. The 75 ton ha-1 application was most effective. Its effects on these soil properties were more obvious at the end of the second year. HHC did not affect macropore/micropore ratio of the soil until the third year, due to an increase in micropore number. Although the effects of the other organic amendments on structural stability of soil were more obvious in the second year, the effect of HHC increased in the third year, due to its high C/N ratio. The 75 ton ha-1 application of HHC increased the structural stability of the soil the most. HHC had the highest organic carbon content. The effects of HHC on physical productivity of soil generally were clearer at the end of the second year. For this reason, it is recommended that HHC should be reapplied after two years as organic fertilizer. Further studies should be carried out to determine the long-term effects of HHC on physical productivity of soils.

AB The physical and hydrological properties of peat from seven peatlands in northern Maputaland (South Africa) were investigated and related to the degradation processes of peatlands in different hydrogeomorphic settings. The selected peatlands are representative of typical hydrogeomorphic settings and different stages of human modification from natural to severely degraded. Nineteen transects (141 soil corings in total) were examined in order to describe peat properties typical of the distinct hydrogeomorphic settings. We studied degree of decomposition, organic matter content, bulk density, water retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity and hydrophobicity of the peats. From these properties we derived pore size distribution, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and maximum capillary rise. We found that, after drainage, degradation advances faster in peatlands containing wood peat than in peatlands containing radicell peat. Eucalyptus plantations in catchment areas are especially threatening to peatlands in seeps, interdune depressions and unchannelled valley bottoms. All peatlands and their recharge areas require wise management, especially valley-bottom peatlands with swamp forest vegetation. Blocking drainage ditches is indispensable as a first step towards achieving the restoration of drained peatland areas, and further measures may be necessary to enhance the distribution of water. The sensitive swamp forest ecosystems should be given conservation priority.

TI Carbon accumulation in peatland
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID RAISED MIRE; FINLAND; AGE
AB (1) Models of pear accumulation are developed that include constant, linear and quadratic decay of dry mass remaining. Profiles of dry bulk density of 795 peatlands distributed over Finland are used to infer cumulative carbon for each site. These values and basal ages are themselves used to infer rates of growth and decay of the peat. (2) A method, 'function parameter fitting' (FPF), is devised to estimate parameter values in non-linear functions when there are uncertainties in both variables, as there are in cumulative carbon and age. Where the data are highly variable then results with FPF are substantially different from those used hitherto that assume uncertainty in only the dependent variable. (3) For five regions in Finland and in Boreal Canada the inferred rate of addition, p(*) [M L-2 T-1], is related to degree-days above zero, and decay, a(*) [T-1] is related logarithmically to mean annual temperature. The present day rate of accumulation of carbon in northern peatlands is about 5.6 Tmol yr(-1) or, as dry mass, 0.07 Gt yr(-1). (4) There are difficulties in the interpretation of LARCA (= LORCA = long term average rate of carbon accumulation). Understanding of peatland dynamics may result from the use of intrinsic models allowing decay: it is unlikely to emerge from the exotic models in common use.

AB This paper describes a study of nutrient dynamics in 17 tidal and non-tidal freshwater riverine wetlands in The Netherlands, Belgium, and Maryland (USA). The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationships between nutrient cycling processes in riverine wetlands that were geographically separated, that were dominated by different types of vegetation, and that had different hydrodynamics We also compared restored and natural riverine wetlands. The results showed distinct differences in interstitial water chemistry between the sites in Maryland and Europe. No such regional differences were found in the soil variables, except for soil phosphorus, which was higher in The Netherlands. Soil organic matte, total nitrogen and phosphorus content, and bulk density were higher in tidal freshwater wetland soils. Forested wetland soils had higher organic matter and total nitrogen and lower bulk density and total phosphorus than soils from wetlands dominated by herbaceous species. Restored wetlands had lower soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen and phosphorus than similar types of natural riverine wetlands. There were no differences in nutrient-related process rates nor plant nutrient concentrations in tidal versus non-tidal riverine wetlands. Lower nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in plants at the restored sites suggest that nutrient uptake by vegetation may be poorly coupled to rates of nutrient cycling during early stages of vegetation development. A principal components analysis of the data identified groupings of soil and water variables that were similar to those that had been previously identified when we applied the same methods to peatlands that were also geographically widely separated. Results of the study demonstrate that the techniques that we have been using are robust and repeatable. They are especially useful for making general comparisons of nitrogen and phosphorus cycling when there are limitations on the number of wetland that can be sampled. The approach that we have developed may also be used to calibrate and refine nutrient cycling models that are incorporated into wetland assessment procedures.

AB Methods for interpreting the microwave high-frequency emission of open canopies are proposed in this article. Three frequencies are considered: 23.8, 36.5, and 90 GHz. The microwave data were collected simultaneously with the canopy infrared temperature, and ground measurements of moisture, temperature, and bulk density of the soil together with water content and volume fraction of the vegetation. Soil emission is modeled using dielectric permittivity and roughness parameters previously determined over bare soil surfaces. Two kinds of vegetation canopies are considered: a sparse-growing sorghum and a wheat canopy composed of dense, large patches. The microwave mired soil-vegetation emission is analyzed using three modeling approaches. At 23.8 and 36.5 GHz, a random continuous approach can. be applied. The sparse canopy emission is efficiently described by considering the vegetation layer as homogeneous. Conversely, a mixing equation must be used for the patchy canopy. At 90 GHz, another technique is applied. It consists of including vegetation in soil roughness parameters. The problem with retrieving the canopy temperature and the near-surface soil moisture at high frequencies is addressed. For the sparse canopy, soil moisture retrieval is possible. The canopy temperature is retrieved with poor accuracy, however. Over the patchy surface, geophysical parameter retrieval with high frequencies alone seems much more difficult.

AB Pulp mill ash was evaluated as a substrate component in the production of greenhouse-grown French marigold (Tagetes patula L. 'Janie Deep Orange'). Peat-based substrates (75:10:15 by volume blend of peatmoss, vermiculite, and perlite) amended with 0% to 50% (by volume) pulp mill ash were compared with a standard commercially available substrate. With the exception of an unfertilized control, each substrate blend contained 5.93 kg.m(-3) 14N-6.2P-11.6K (3- to 4-month release) and 0.89 kg.m(-3) Micromax. Substrates containing higher volumes of ash had finer particles, less air space, and more waterholding capacity than the commercial substrate. Bulk density increased with increasing ash volume, and substrate containing 50% ash had 120% greater bulk density than the commercial substrate. Substrates containing ash generally had higher pH and electrical conductivity (EC) than the commercial substrate with substrate pH and EC increasing with increasing ash volume. In general, marigold plants grown in peat-based substrates with the addition of 0% to 50% ash had similar growth indices, flower dry weights, numbers of flowers, and SPAD values as plants grown in commercial substrate; however, plants grown in substrates containing 30% to 50% ash had lower shoot dry weights or root quality ratings than plants grown in commercial substrate. Plant growth index, shoot dry weight, and root quality rating decreased with increasing ash volume.

AB Peatlands are becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change because they store large amounts of carbon, but information regarding the exact amount of carbon is scarce. In their natural state (as mires), they sequester and store organic carbon (C-org), but they emit CO2 when drained. In calculating C-org storage, little attention has been paid to the fact that many peatlands have been intensively drained and used for more than 200 years, such that their soil characteristics have changed. Recent estimates of peatland carbon storage are based on simplified data for peat thickness, bulk density and C-org content. This paper offers an alternative method for estimating the amount of carbon stored which takes into account peatland type and secondary soil development. Peatlands that originated as different hydrogenetic mire types (HGMTs) store different amounts of carbon due to stratigraphical differences. It is estimated that 430 Mt of C-org is stored in peatlands belonging to the three dominant HGMTs in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (north-east Germany), and that percolation-mire peatlands store up to ten times more C-org than water-risemire peatlands. It is also demonstrated that gyttja soils make a significant contribution to C-org storage in terrestrialisation-mire peatlands; thus, after peats, these are the next most important soils for C-org stocks.

AB The maritime plateau glacier of northern Folgefonna in western Norway has a short (subdecadal) response time to climatic shifts, and is therefore well suited for reconstructing high-resolution glacier fluctuations. The reconstruction presented here is based on physical parameters of glaciolacustrine sediments retrieved from two glacier-fed lakes and a peat bog north of the ice cap. Bulk density and modelled glacier net mass balance for the last 200 years show a remarkably similar pattern, where maximum sediment yield lags the glacier net mass balance by similar to 10 years. The record of glacier variations has been transferred into an equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) variation curve. Glaciers respond primarily to changes in summer temperature and winter precipitation. At present there is a high correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and measured (since the early 1960s) net mass balance on maritime glaciers in western Norway (r = similar to 0.8). Reconstructed glacier variations from maritime western Norway are therefore considered indicative of the strength of the westerly airflow associated with NAO during the Holocene. The early phase of mid-Holocene glacier growth (5200 cal. yr BP) was characterized by gradual glacier expansion culminating in the first Subatlantic glacial event at 2300 cal. yr BP. The climate during the last 2200 years has favoured increased glacier activity at Folgefonna. High-amplitude shifts in ELA may be explained by unstable modes of the westerlies causing significant variability of winter precipitation. During the last 2000 years, Folgefonna expanded and decayed with significant decadal variability. During the latest period of the 'MediaevalWarm Epoch', Folgefonna advanced. The Neoglacial maximum, however, was reached during the 'Little Ice Age' at AD 1750 and AD 1870. The northern Folgefonna glacial record is compared to other Holocene glacier records in Scandinavia.

AB Multi-proxy paleoecological analyses were carried out on cores from a peatland in the continuous permafrost zone, to determine the effect of past climatic change on peatland development. Shatigraphy, bulk density and organic matter content were analyzed for eight cores from Campbell Creek peatland (69 degrees 17.3'N, 133 degrees 15'W). Detailed pollen and macrofossil analyses were carried out on two cores, and stable isotope analysis on one of those cores. The results indicate a succession, starting at 9000-9500 BP, from an open water mineral wetland with aquatic plants, to a fen dominated by Drepanocladus mosses and sedges, and then a change to a Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic vegetation typical of most of the peatland today. The beginning of the latter transition appears to coincide with the end of the early Holocene warm period. The physical stratigraphies of the other six cores indicate that a similar successional sequence occurred across the peatland, with some local variation. The transition to ombrotrophic conditions may be associated with the aggradation of permafrost in the peatland, in response to regional cooling. The effect of climate cooling on the peatland was probably indirect, through the aggradation of permafrost and associated hydrological changes.

TI Characterization of Water Retention Curves for a Series of Cultivated

AB Water retention curves are essential for the parameterization of soil water models such as HYDRUS. Although hydraulic parameters are known for a large number of mineral and natural organic soils, our knowledge on the hydraulic behavior of cultivated Histosols is rather limited. The objective of this study was to derive characteristic water retention curves for a large cultivated peatland with lettuce ( Lactuca sativa L.) and vegetable farming in southern Quebec, Canada. A comparison showed that the van Genuchten model fits better to the water retention data obtained with a Tempe pressure cell experiment than the Groenevelt-Grant model in terms of residual sum of squares; however, the difference in performance was quite small due to the high number of iterations used for fitting. Finally, an agglomerative cluster analysis of 85 peat samples allowed us to define two distinct water retention curves, where the first water retention curve described samples of relatively shallow (< 150 cm) Histosols with an organic content < 0.89 and a bulk density > 0.3 g cm(-3), and the second curve characterized samples of the deepest ( depth 150-230 cm) Histosols with an organic content of up to 0.97 and a bulk density > 0.3 g cm(-3), which are the soils that suffered a more dramatic transformation as a result of agriculture. This characterization allows for a multitude of applications, including parameterization of the HYDRUS model for soil water movement, and presents an essential tool for the optimization of water management in cultivated peatlands.

AB Here, we present results from the most comprehensive compilation of Holocene peat soil properties with associated carbon and nitrogen accumulation rates for northern peatlands. Our database consists of 268 peat cores from 215 sites located north of 45 degrees N. It encompasses regions within which peat carbon data have only recently become available, such as the West Siberia Lowlands, the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Kamchatka in Far East Russia, and the Tibetan Plateau. For all northern peatlands, carbon content in organic matter was estimated at 42 +/- 3% (standard deviation) for Sphagnum peat, 51 +/- 2% for non-Sphagnum peat, and at 49 +/- 2% overall. Dry bulk density averaged 0.12 +/- 0.07 g/cm(3), organic matter bulk density averaged 0.11 +/- 0.05 g/cm(3), and total carbon content in peat averaged 47 +/- 6%. In general, large differences were found between Sphagnum and non-Sphagnum peat types in terms of peat properties. Time-weighted peat carbon accumulation rates averaged 23 +/- 2 (standard error of mean) g C/m(2)/yr during the Holocene on the basis of 151 peat cores from 127 sites, with the highest rates of carbon accumulation (25-28 g C/m(2)/yr) recorded during the early Holocene when the climate was warmer than the present. Furthermore, we estimate the northern peatland carbon and nitrogen pools at 436 and 10 gigatons, respectively. The database is publicly available at https://peatlands.lehigh.edu.

AB Some agricultural and industrial characteristics of different parts of the giant reed (Arundo donax L.) were studied in this work to evaluate their capacity as growing media and for the manufacturing of the insulating board employed in the building sector. Three different particle sizes (>0.25, 1-2, and 2-4 mm) of the stem and rhizome of Arundo donax L. (SAD and RAD, respectively) were evaluated on bulk density (BD), total pore space (TPS), air capacity, easily available water (EAW), water buffering capacity (WBC), total water-holding capacity (TWHC), shrinkage, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and macro- and microelements. Moreover, density, bending strength, internal bond strength, screw-holding strength, and thermal conductivity were determined in boards manufactured with three different particle sizes (>0.25, 1-2, and 2-4 mm) of the stem of Arundo donax. The manufacturing conditions of these boards were three different press pressures (15.7, 21.0, and 26.0 kg cm(-2)) and two press temperatures (120 and 140 degrees C). With respect to the agricultural value of this vegetative species, most of physical properties were not inside the interval of values for an ideal substrate. Bulk density, TPS, air capacity, and EAW values were greater in SAD substrates than those of RAD-based media. In general, the particle size of different parts of the giant reed had a significant effect on the physical parameters studied. The macro- and microelement contents were low in comparison to peat, except in the cases of K in both substrates types (SAD and RAD) and TN in RAD substrates. In general, no great differences were observed in the chemical properties related to the particle size of media used. On the other hand, the physical and mechanical properties of the fiberboards from giant reed were comparable to those of the wood-based composites, and the thermal conductivity of these boards was similar to that of other environmentally friendly fiberboards. Mechanical and physical properties of the boards were more significantly affected by the particle size and press pressure than by the press temperature.

AB A forested wetland data set from northeastern Ontario, consisting of species cover and environmental measures in 43 stands, was analyzed with canonical correspondence analysis. Results showed two main vegetational gradients related to factor complexes of peat depth - moisture (mire margin to mire expanse) and pH-calcium. Stands within each of the vegetation types were positioned closely, and gradients of types were similar to those from earlier analyses, suggesting the validity of a previous classification. Axis I of the ordination was highly related to peat depth, several elements (Al, Fe, and Cu), loss on ignition, bulk density, and water content in peat. Axis Il was highly related to loss on ignition, depth of fibric layer, pH, and several elements (Ca, Mg, Mn, and N). The number of species in a plot was strongly correlated to the pH-calcium gradient, whereas vegetation cover was strongly correlated to the peat depth - moisture gradient. Analysis with detrended correspondence analysis gave results very similar to canonical correspondence analysis, suggesting that there was a relatively high correspondence between vegetational and environmental gradients. Environmental measures were partitioned into physical and chemical attributes, to detect the relative contribution to vegetational variation. Both physical and chemical variables were important, and 81% of the variation in vegetation was explained by the environmental measures.

AB Sphagnum mosses form a major component of northern peatlands, which are expected to experience substantially higher increases in temperature and winter precipitation than the global average. Sphagnum may play an important role in the responses of the global carbon cycle to climate change. We investigated the responses of summer length growth, carpet structure and production in Sphagnum fuscum to experimentally induced changes in climate in a sub-arctic bog. Thereto, we used open-top chambers (OTCs) to create six climate scenarios including changes in summer temperatures, and changes in winter snow cover and spring temperatures. In winter, the OTCs doubled the snow thickness, resulting in 0.5-2.8degreesC higher average air temperatures. Spring air temperatures in OTCs increased by 1.0degreesC. Summer warming had a maximum effect of 0.9degreesC, while vapor pressure deficit was not affected. The climate manipulations had strong effects on S. fuscum. Summer warming enhanced the length increment by 42-62%, whereas bulk density decreased. This resulted in a trend (P<0.10) of enhanced biomass production. Winter snow addition enhanced dry matter production by 33%, despite the fact that the length growth and bulk density did not change significantly. The addition of spring warming to snow addition alone did not significantly enhance this effect, but we may have missed part of the early spring growth. There were no interactions between the manipulations in summer and those in winter/spring, indicating that the effects were additive. Summer warming may in the long term negatively affect productivity through the adverse effects of changes in Sphagnum structure on moisture holding and transporting capacity. Moreover, the strong length growth enhancement may affect interactions with other mosses and vascular plants. Because winter snow addition enhanced the production of S. fuscum without affecting its structure, it may increase the carbon balance of northern peatlands.

SO CROP SCIENCE

ID CREEPING BENTGRASS; MIXES; AMENDMENTS; ZEOLITE; GROWTH; TURF
AB Modern putting green rootzones are typically constructed using sands to avoid compaction and facilitate rapid drainage. Sands are often amended with organic matter (OM) such as sphagnum peat moss (SP) to increase moisture holding capacity. However, OM decomposition into finely divided material may negatively affect longterm soil physical properties. Inorganic amendments (IAs) having high water retention may be more suitable because of their resistance to biodegradation. A laboratory study determined the physical properties [bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat), water retention, and pore size distribution] of three USDA sand size classes (fine, medium, and coarse) with and without amendment. Amendments used were calcined clay, vitrified clay, extruded diatomaceous earth, a processed zeolite, and SP. Amendments were tested at two incorporation rates (10 and 20% v/v), and in situ in 30-cm-deep rootzones at two incorporation depths (15 and 30 cm). Bulk density decreased, total porosity increased, and K-sat declined with amendment rate, but varied considerably depending on amendment, sand size, and incorporation depth. The K-sat was high for all mixtures, averaging 250 cm h(-1), probably because of the very uniform sands. On the basis of standard pressure plate methods, IAs increased total water holding capacity (WHC) of all three sands but did not increase available water. However, a unique bioassay for available water indicated that porous IAs may contain appreciably more available water than measured by the pressure plate technique. Although the IAs significantly altered the physical properties of the three sands, they were not as effective as SP at improving water retention in coarse-textured, drought-prone sands.

AB The aim of this study is to comprehensively assess the change in oxidoreductive enzyme activities, due to the potential in catalyzing oxidation and reduction reactions, as the basic processes on undrained and drained peat soils. On undrained peatlands, a significant decrease of enzyme activities was observed such as xanthine oxidase, urate oxidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase with an increase in depth. It was connected with significantly higher porosity values, hot water extractable organic carbon, and total organic nitrogen contents, ammonium and nitrate ions concentrations, and significantly lower ash and bulk density values in the upper layers. On drained peatlands, a significant increase of enzyme activities in depth was measured. Enzyme activities such as xanthine, urate, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase were documented to be effective as new indicators and tools for changes of the moorsh-forming process in association with the oscillation of the water table caused by the drainage of the peatlands.

AB Transformation of organic amendments in soil greatly affects its physical, chemical, and biological properties. The aim of this study was to investigate changes of soil quality attributes in field plots after 3-5 years of annual paddy-upland crop rotation with various fertilizations since 1995. Other than the amendments of green manure, compost, and peat, chemical fertilizer N in the amounts of 33% and 67% of established N rate were complemented. Spring rice (Oryza sativa L.) and autumn maize (Zea mays L.) were planted each year. After the harvests of three to five maize and rice crops from 1998 through 2000, surface soil samples were collected from the plots of each treatment. Applications of organic materials to the plots prevented soil pH from decreasing, and increased the amounts of soluble salts. After rice harvest, the soil water contents at 0.033 MPa tension were significantly greater in soils amended with peat and/or compost than that with chemical fertilizer and the check. The bulk density of surface soils of the field plots amended with organic materials was significantly lower than that of the check. After maize harvest, the differences in bulk density of the surface soils among the seven treatments were not significant. The percentages of water stable aggregate in 1-2 and 0.5-1 mm. particle size fractions of the soils, amended with peat and compost, were significantly higher than those amended with chemical fertilizer and the check. Although chemical fertilizer played a significant role in governing the maize and rice yields, it did not significantly contribute to the improvement of some soil quality attributes.

AB The surface biomass of moss dominated by Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr. (Rusty Bog-moss) was harvested from a sparsely drained raised bog. Physical properties of the Sphagnum moss were determined and compared with those of weakly and moderately decomposed peats. Water retention curves (WRC) and saturated hydraulic conductivities (K-s) are reported for samples of Sphagnum moss with natural structure, as well as for samples that were cut to selected fibre lengths or compacted to different bulk densities. The gravimetric water retention results indicate that, on a dry mass basis, Sphagnum moss can hold more water than both types of peat under equal matric potentials. On a volumetric basis, the water retention of Sphagnum moss can be linearly increased by compacting at a gravimetric water content of 2 (g water / g dry mass). The bimodal water retention curve of Sphagnum moss appears to be a consequence of the natural double porosity of the moss matrix. The 6-parameter form of the double-porosity van Genuchten equation is used to describe the volumetric water retention of the moss as its bulk density increases. Our results provide considerable insight into the physical growing media properties of Sphagnum moss biomass.

AB Ten substrates were evaluated for their capacity to promote the growth of potted Lantana camara. The substrates consisted of different volumetric proportions of sandy loam soil (S), peat (P), perlite (Per), and urea formaldehyde resin foam (UFRF referred to as F), the latter in an effort to substitute peat use in horticulture. The substrates studied were: S, S-60:P-40, S-40:P-60, S-60:P-40, S-40:F-60, P-60:F-40, P-40:F-60, S-40:P-30:Per(30), S-40:F-30:Per(30), and P-50:Per(50). Measurements included: 1) substrate physical and chemical characteristics such as water characteristic curves, bulk density, total porosity, easily available water, and pH; 2) biometric measurements such as shoot length and number and number of flowers; and 3) determination of main and lateral stems, leaf, flower, and root dry weights. Results showed that substrates P-60: F-40 and P-40: F-60 retained excessive water in all tensions, whereas substrate P-50:Per(50) exhibited increased water retention at saturation that was quickly reduced after 10 cm of tension. The non-amended soil (S) had the least water retention capacity and proved to be a slow-draining substrate. Supplementation either with peat or peat and perlite (S-60:P-40, S-40:P-60, and S-40:P-30:Per(30)) significantly increased water retention in the soil-based substrates. Soil-based substrates supplemented with UFRF retained less water compared with peat-amended soil-based substrates. Concerning plant growth, Lantana plants growing in the UFRF-amended substrates were unable to recover from frost injury and their evaluation was interrupted after winter as a result of total plant loss. The injury was attributed to the reduction of plant growth in UFRF-supplemented substrates before the occurrence of frost stress events. Soil-based substrates (S, S60:1340, S-40:P-60, and S-40:P-30:Per(30)) provided greater shoot growth, which was almost twofold compared with substrate P-50:Per(50). Substrate S-40:P-30:Per(30)) produced the most lateral shoots and flowers over the whole study period, whereas S-40:P-60 produced the most flowers during the summer. Dry weights of both stem and lateral stems followed a similar pattern with the biometric measurements. However the non-amended soil (S) produced the highest leaf and root dry weights followed by substrates S-60:P-40 and S-40:P-60. It was concluded that both substrates S-40:P-60 and S-40:P-30:Per(30) can successfully be used for Lantana nursery production as a result of their decreased bulk density, increased water retention capacity, adequate porosity, and promotion of shoot growth and flowering. Despite its high bulk density, substrate S could be used in the production of Lantana plants for landscape use as a result of the increased root production.

AB The stratigraphy of four peat sequences collected in two peat bogs located in the Eastmain River watershed (52 degrees N, 76 degrees W), James Bay lowlands, Quebec, Canada, was investigated to reconstruct past hydroclimatic conditions of peat accumulation and associated carbon dynamics during the late Holocene. Analyses of macrofossils, testate amoebae, peat humification, C/N ratio and bulk density were performed at high-resolution along each peat core, allowing the potential of each proxy indicator under varying nutrient status and hydroclimatic conditions to be evaluated. Some synchronous changes were recorded both within and between peatlands, suggesting the influence of allogenic factors in the development of these peatlands. Other reconstructed changes have highlighted autogenic succession processes related to the local geomorphic and hydrologic context. Highest peat carbon accumulation rates (LORCA) were correlated with either wet conditions or high woody debris percentages, suggesting that residence time of the biomass in the acrotelm and the nature of plant material can both influence carbon accumulation rates in peat bogs. This study provides the first high-resolution paleoecohydrological reconstructions from the mid-boreal ecoregion of eastern Canada, a region in which peatlands occupy 30 to 60% of the land surface.

AB Dating recent peat deposits (i.e., past similar to 300 yrs of peat accumulation) has emerged as an important yet challenging task for estimating rates of organic matter accumulation and atmospheric pollutant deposition in peatlands. Due to their ombrotrophic nature and the tendency for Sphagnum-derived peat to have high cation exchange capacity, peatlands are ideal archives of atmospheric pollution. However, efforts to establish depth-age relationships in peats are complicated by the difficulty of dating deposits reliably. Assumptions underlying the techniques available for dating peat deposits often are poorly understood and generally untested. We outline the approaches used to establish depth-age relationships in peat chronologies, including brief descriptions of the theory, assumptions, methodology, and logistics of each technique. We include both continuous dating methods (i.e., methods based on C-14, Pb-210, constant bulk density, acid-insoluble ash, moss increment, pollen density) and chrono-stratigraphic markers (i.e., fallout isotopes from the Chernobyl accident and nuclear weapons testing, pollen stratigraphies, isothermal remanence magnetism, charcoal particles, spherical carbonaceous particles, PAHs, PCBs, DDT, toxaphene) that can be measured in peat and correlated temporally with known historical events. We also describe the relatively new radiocarbon application of wiggle matching and use hypothetical data to highlight the potential of this developing technique for dating recent peat. Until the uncertainty associated with each of these dating approaches is clarified, we recommend employing multiple techniques to allow for corroboration between different methods.

AB The near-surface layer of the dominant microhabitat types on a peatland in the Rainy River area, northwestern Ontario, Canada was dated using a number of previously published methods. No single method was found to be appropriate in all microhabitat types, and discrepancies of up to 15 yr over a time-scale of 80 yr were encountered. The results suggested that the post-depositional mobility of Pb-210, and possible its atmospheric supply, are affected by microhabitat type. Pb-210 dates consistently underestimated independently derived dates in the uppermost sections of the cores. Ages derived by measuring the length of annual increments on moss stems were in general agreement with the Pb-210 dates, but were subject to bias where the moss remains were poorly preserved. C-14 analyses on material from the base to the near-surface horizon confirmed the modern (post-AD 1950) origin suggested by the Pb-210 and moss increment dates. Increased ash content at the base of the near-surface layer was correlated with the dustbowl of the 1930s, but assignment of dates to other stratigraphic markers (charcoal, Ambrosia pollen, and Larix needles) was less certain. The ash peak (55 yr before AD 1990) was used as datum for relative dating methods based on assumptions of a constant rate of peat accumulation (constant bulk density method) and constant rate of pollen accumulation (pollen density method). The constant bulk density method provided quick, inexpensive estimates of maximum age, but could not be extrapolated beyond datum, nor applied to cores showing marked stratigraphic changes. The pollen density method was valuable but time-consuming alternative for dating peatland depressions, which lack annual moss increments and are subject to Pb-210 leaching.

AB Additionally to long-term field experiments a laboratory method was tested for evaluation the physical efficiency of addition of composts to soil. The parameters maximal water holding capacity (MWK), bulk density (TRD), and total pore volume (PV) were determined under reproducible conditions for compost-soil-mixtures in comparison to equivalent mixtures of soil with standard-peatlitter. The ratio of the coefficients of regression for compost-soilmixtures to those for standard-peat-litter-soil-mixtures is the so-called equivalent of standard-peat-litter (TMA). The efficiency of changes of soil physical properties due to the addition of compost to soil is characterized by TMA.

AB Commercial cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is cultivated on postglacial deposits of peat capped by 0.3-1 m of anthropogenic sand. Despite distinct soil layering, a general paucity of information exists on the physical properties of sand and peat in cranberry bogs. Field measurements and ground penetrating radar (GPR) were used to determine sand and peat thicknesses of 30 cranberry bogs in Massachusetts, United States. GPR-based estimates of peat volume and detailed soil maps were then used to develop a geospatial model of mean peat thickness (L*) in cranberry bogs. The model was applied to 505 cranberry bogs that covered in area of 2827 ha. Based on model results and field measurements, average sand and peat thicknesses were 0.5 and 0.9 m, respectively. For individual bogs, mean peat thickness exhibited considerable range, with deep peat (L* > 1.8 m) identified in 22% of the cranberry bogs. Peat was absent (L* = 0 m) in 26% of the cranberry bogs, which reflected modified upland or glaciolacustrine soils rather than peat. Using average thickness, nutrient concentration, and bulk density of peat and sand layers, a typical cranberry bog stores 750 Mg ha(-1) of carbon, 22,900 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen, and 790 kg ha(-1) of phosphorus. We estimate that peat stores 91% and 78% (by mass) of carbon and nitrogen in cranberry bogs, respectively. In contrast, sand stores the majority of P (78% by mass) in cranberry bogs.

AB Various inorganic soil amendments have been promoted as a means of improving the chemical and physical properties of certain soils. To test this hypothesis, a marginally productive soil was supplemented with 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% (v/v) of either selected inorganic amendments or sand. Amendments consisted of commercially available diatomaceous earth, calcined clay, zeolite, and crystalline SiO2. The soil material was extracted from the argillic horizon of a Cecil sandy loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults). Ability of these soil-amendment mixtures to promote 'Tifway' bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt Davy] growth was evaluated under greenhouse conditions, and contrasted to that obtained in nonamended soil. Selected chemical and physical properties that are pertinent to plant growth were also evaluated. The experiment, which was conducted 3x, began with a approximate to60-day period in which both water and nutrients were optimum. This was followed by a 30-day drought. During optimum water and nutrients, no soil-amendment treatment(s) consistently resulted in superior bermudagrass growth compared to soil alone. However, <2% of the bermudagrass tissue that was produced during the drought became green and succulent with the resumption of irrigation in nonamended soil. This percentage was exceeded by all treatments that contained either greater than or equal to60% diatomaceous earth (Axis), or greater than or equal to40% calcined clay (Profile); and by 100% zeolite (Clinolite) and 100% silica (Green's Choice). Drought-sustaining ability of soil-amendment mixtures was significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with water-holding ability, soil strength, bulk density, and oxygen diffusion rate, but not correlated with either pH or cation exchange capacity (CEC). While certain inorganic amendments did improve the drought-sustaining ability of soil, the amount required was generally greater than or equal to40%.

AB The mineralization of soil organic nitrogen in two floating marshes types in Louisiana, USA with different vegetation and mat thickness (and biomass) was measured by incubating peat soil in situ in polyethylene bottles at depths of 10 and 25 cm. The size of the extractable inorganic N (NH4+ - N) pool was related to mat thickness and soil bulk density. The N mineralization rates were twice as great at the thick mat site (1.5 mg N/kg soil/day) compared to the thin mat floating marsh (0.71 mg N/kg soil/day). The amount mineralized on a volume basis to 30 cm depth were 22 mg N/m(2)/day for the thick mat marsh and 6 mg N/m(2)/day for the thin mat marsh. The nitrogen mineralization rates observed in this study reflect plant biomass differences between the thick mat and thin mat marshes, with the former exhibiting approximately 7-fold greater biomass. These low overall mineralization rates suggest that nitrogen entering these freshwater floating marshes from Mississippi River water percolating through the root zone, would result in increased plant productivity-increasing marsh stability and also providing a natural mechanism contributing to the processing and removal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in river water entering these wetlands.

AB Hybrid terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems in the Andes, commonly known as bofedales, consist of both peatlands and wet meadows and line valley floors at elevations > 3800 m. Compared with similar ecosystems at lower altitudes and higher latitudes, the ecosystem processes and spatial patterns of bofedales are only just beginning to be understood. The research presented here provides the first exploratory and descriptive analysis of the biodiversity and place-to-place variation of vegetation in bofedales in three valleys inside Peru's Huascaran National Park. Through vegetation surveys, we recorded 112 plant species in 29 families. Over a short geographical distance, a valley-to-valley comparison showed high dissimilarity in terms of species composition. Based on dominant life form and species composition, vegetation in bofedales can be grouped into five assemblages. Our preliminary analysis suggests that several abiotic factors could influence the floristic composition of bofedales: elevation, bulk density, percent organic matter, and cation exchange capacity. The findings of high valley-to-valley variation in species, soil and elevation influences may be useful to land managers of high mountain landscapes that are undergoing transformation related to glacier recession. While our findings advance research on tropical Andean bofedales, they also highlight the need for additional comprehensive investigations to fill gaps in knowledge about the tropical mountains of Latin America.

AB Spatial variation of C stocks within peatlands is an overall challenge for monitoring global C cycle processes, which is critical for responding to climate change induced by greenhouse gases (GHGs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of high-resolution, minimally invasive sensor data to predict spatial variation of soil organic C (SOC) stocks within highly degraded peatland soils in northeast Germany. Within the Rhin-Havelluch, a paludification mire that has been cultivated and drained for about 300 yr, seven fields were sampled by soil cores up to 2 m in depth, nine points for each field. Soil horizons were examined for dry bulk density, soil organic C content (SOCC), and thickness to calculate SOC stocks and to test for relationships with overall peat thickness, elevation, and electrical conductivity (ECa). Elevation was determined by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ECa by an EM38DD, both producing maps of high resolution (1 m). Soil organic C density (SOCd) was related to elevation, ECa, and peat thickness. Based on these relationships, maps of SOCd were produced. Within field variation of SOCd was high, which could be modeled by use of the covariate maps. If available, ECa maps can improve the prediction of SOCd based on elevation. Modeling peat thickness based on sensor data needs additional research, but seems to be a valuable covariate in digital soil mapping.

TI Evaluation of poplar wood chips after 19 years of burial as swamp
   roadway fill
SO FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Wood chip fill material from a highway shoulder-widening in northern Minnesota was evaluated by a variety of physical tests after 19 years of burial. Chips discolored when excavated (typical tannate oxidation reaction) and remained gray on air-drying. Chips from the shallow layer burial sites were essentially sound if collected just beneath the clay cap and approximated sound chips in moisture level, bulk density, and specific gravity, but were slightly less acidic than fresh aspen/balsam poplar, Those chips collected near the sphagnum peat base (50 cm down from clay) were somewhat soft on the surface and broke easily on bending. These chips had notably higher moisture contents at collection and lower specific gravities than those from the clay cap zone. Microscopic examination of chips noted extensive pitting and erosion of wood fiber walls and destruction of wood parenchyma (storage) cells consistent with attack by bacteria known to develop in waterlogged wood with limited oxygen available. Chips from a thicker fill layer design followed this pattern for one collection site, (i.e., sound chips at upper level under clay cap; degraded chips near peat, 150 cm from clay), but chips at upper and lower levels were basically sound at the second collection location. Though chips did have different moisture-holding capacities, their overall bulk density was essentially the same for locations within each site. Absence of fungal degradation is attributed to lack of oxygen rather than limitations of pH, water, or nutrients. These data support use of wood chips for lightweight fill of roadways in swamps.

AB In soilless culture, a suitable mixed substrate that provides a balanced and stable rhizosphere environment is vital for promoting plant growth. The present study was undertaken to establish seven prediction models of physical and chemical properties, including bulk density (DB), total porosity (TP), water-holding porosity (WHP), air porosity (AP), WHP/AP, electrical conductivity (EC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) of mixed substrate based on regression equations of measured values from 76 substrate combinations. These seven models were verified using the measured values of 12 mixed substrates, and the average relative prediction errors (REs) were all less than 10%. A comprehensive property prediction model was established by weighted summation of the seven models of physical and chemical properties. According to the set values of DB, TP, WHP, AP, WHP/AP, EC and CEC, the comprehensive property model predicted the six mixture proportions of mixed-substrate, as verified using the measured values. This study is the first to establish prediction models for the physical and chemical properties of mixed substrates. The comprehensive property model could be used to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of commercial mixed substrates, and to provide the optimal mixture substrate formulations according to the setting property value of production requirement.

AB Various estimates have suggested that the peatlands of Scotland are a significant deposit of fixed carbon. However, these have been based upon rather imprecise estimates of peat depth. Using previously unused archived data, we have mapped peat depth across the country and then used these values to obtain an improved value of the total carbon stock within peatlands, as well as indicating their spatial distribution. We included peat deposits that occur in combination with other soils in soil map units other than 'blanket' or 'basin' peat. We obtained an area-weighted mean peat depth of 2.0 m, which is slightly shallower than previous estimates. Using values of bulk density and % carbon from the Scottish soils database, the total peatland carbon stock came to 1620 Mt, which represents 56% of the total carbon in all Scottish soils.

DT Article
ID COMPACTION
AB Field trials were undertaken in north-east England and south-west Scotland to investigate the degree and nature of disturbance on selected forest soils during mechanized harvesting, where extraction routes were armoured with a layer of logging residues (slash roads). Dry soil bulk density, soil strength (soil penetration resistance) and saturated hydraulic conductivity, measured directly beneath the machine wheel tracks on gleyed mineral and deep peatland soils (peat >45 cm deep), exhibited only minor changes despite high levels of trafficking. This was ascribed to (1) the role of the slash roads in reducing machine ground pressures; (2) the inherent strength and elastic recovery of the overlying fibrous peaty soils, retained in situ as a result of the slash roads; and (3) the slow rates of densification associated with the underlying saturated fine textured mineral soils. In addition, the slash roads were observed to improve vehicle traction and efficient carriage of timber to roadside log landings. This study demonstrated that disturbance on peaty or fine-to-medium textured mineral soils at high water contents can be largely avoided, allowing operations to continue during periods when wet ground conditions may otherwise limit harvesting.

AB Smouldering fires in peatland are different from the flames in wildland fires. Smouldering peat fire is slow, low-temperature and more persistent, releasing large amounts of smoke into the atmosphere. In this work, we experimentally and computationally investigate the vertical downward spread of smouldering fire in a column of 30 cm-tall moss peat under variable moisture content ( MC) and bulk density. The measured downward spread rate decreases with depth and wet bulk density, and is similar to 1 cm h(-1) equivalent to a carbon emission flux of 200 tonnes day(-1) ha(-1). We observe that downward spread increases as MC increases substantially at least inside the range from 10 to 70%, which is not intuitive and goes against the trend observed for the horizontal spread in the same peat. We also conduct one-dimensional computational simulations to successfully reproduce the experimental observations. The analysis shows that the spread rate increases with MC and decreases with density because smouldering spread is controlled by the oxygen supply. The volume of the porous peat expands when absorbing water, which reduces the density of organic matter and decreases the heat release rate. This shows that the widely assumed conclusion that the spread rate of wildfire decreases with MC is not universal when applied to smouldering fires.

AB [1] Peatlands represent an important component of the global carbon cycle, storing 23 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Peatland mining eliminates the carbon sink function of the peatland. In this paper we measure the total ecosystem respiration in a natural, 2 and 3 year (young) and 7 and 8 year (old) postcutover peatland near Sainte-Marguerite- Marie, Quebec, during the summers of 1998 and 1999. Although the natural site was a source of CO2 during the dry 1998 study season (138 g C m(-2)), CO2 emissions were between 260 and 290% higher in the cutover sites (363 and 399 g C m(-2) for young and old, respectively). Cutover site CO2 emissions were only 88 and 112 g CO2-C m(-2) at the young and old sites during the wet 1999 study season. Total ecosystem respiration was more dependent on the water table position than on changes in the thermal regime or the labile carbon of the peat in a dry summer, but the opposite was the case in a wet summer. CO2 emissions increased with postharvest time regardless of a decrease in labile carbon, demonstrating that cutover peatlands are a large persistent source of atmospheric CO2. Direct measurement of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in cutover peatlands, as opposed to determining the loss of carbon from bulk density determinations, provides a better understanding of how peat drainage and harvesting operations affect the carbon balance in peatlands.

AB Accuracy of depth of burn (an indicator of consumption) in peatland soils using prefire and postfire airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data is determined within a wetland-upland forest environment near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. The relationship between peat soil burn depth and an "active" normalized burn ratio (ANBR) is also examined beneath partially and fully burned forest and understory canopies using state-of-the-art active reflectance from a multispectral lidar compared with normalized burn ratio (NBR) derived from Landsat 7 ETM+. We find significant correspondence between depth of burn, lidar-derived ANBR, and difference NBR (dNBR) from Landsat. However, low-resolution optical imagery excludes peatland burn losses in transition zones, which are highly sensitive to peat loss via combustion. The findings presented here illustrate the utility of this new remote sensing technology for expanding an area of research where it has previously been challenging to spatially detect and quantify such wildfire burn losses.

AB Background
   Peatland restoration can have several objectives, for example re-establishing the natural habitat, supporting unique biodiversity attributes or re-initiating key biogeochemical processes, which can ultimately lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Every restoration measure, however, is itself a disturbance to the ecosystem.
   Methods
   Here, we examine an ecosystem shift in a coastal fen at the southern Baltic Sea which was rewetted by flooding. The analyses are based on one year of bi-weekly closed chamber measurements of methane fluxes gathered at spots located in different vegetation stands. During measurement campaigns, we recorded data on water levels, peat temperatures, and chemical properties of peat water. In addition we analyzed the first 20 cm of peat before and after flooding for dry bulk density (DBD), content of organic matter and total amounts of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and other nutrients.
   Results
   Rewetting turned the site from a summer dry fen into a shallow lake with water levels up to 0.60 m. We observed a substantial die-back of vegetation, especially in stands of sedges (Carex acutiformis Ehrh). Concentrations of total organic carbon and nitrogen in the peat water, as well as dry bulk density and concentrations of C, N and S in the peat increased. In the first year after rewetting, the average annual exchange of methane amounted to 0.26 +/- 0.06 kg m(-2). This is equivalent to a 190-times increase in methane compared to pre-flooding conditions. Highest methane fluxes occurred in sedge stands which suffered from the heaviest die-back. None of the recorded environmental variables showed consistent relationships with the amounts of methane exchanged.
   Conclusions
   Our results suggest that rewetting projects should be monitored not only with regard to vegetation development but also with respect to biogeochemical conditions. Further, high methane emissions that likely occur directly after rewetting by flooding should be considered when forecasting the overall effect of rewetting on GHG exchange.

AB Average long-term apparent rates of carbon (C) accumulation (LARCA) were estimated for four peat cores from Arctic and Subarctic Canada. Detailed analyses of dry bulk-density and C content were used to determine variations in C accumulation rates throughout the cores. LARCA range from 12.5 to 16.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over the past 6700-10 000 years. Rates are lower for the surface layers of Arctic high-centred peat polygons, at 5.3 to 7.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the last 3500-4500 years. By comparison, the rate for the near-surface peat from a Sphagnum fuscum hummock in the high Subarctic was considerably higher, at 24.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1) The highest carbon accumulation rates were from core segments older than 4500 BP, which represent fen stages according to palaeoecological analysis. The average LARCA in our study are considerably lower than recent estimates of average carbon accumulation in Boreal peatlands. This difference is attributable partly to lower carbon percentages in our cores compared to the mean or estimated values of 50 to 51.7% used in those studies. Another factor is the presence of ground ice, which exaggerates the apparent peal depth and leads to erroneously high values if cumulative carbon estimates are based on depth. Using cumulative dry bulk-density, as we have done, eliminates the influence of ground ice and thus makes more accurate estimates possible.

AB Growth substrate plays an important role in determining the quality of runoff from green roofs. However, no systematic research has been conducted to design a substrate to improve runoff quality. Hence, the present study aimed at designing and developing a green roof substrate using low-cost and environmentally-benign materials. The inorganic fraction of the substrate includes purosil, vermiculite, sand and light-weight clay aggregates (LECA); whereas the organic fraction includes coco-peat and Sargassum wightii. Through factorial design, 13 different substrate mixes were prepared and the optimum mix (20% purosil, 30% vermiculite, 10% sand, 20% LECA, 10% coco-peat and 10% S. wightii) was found to have high water holding capacity (67.6%), air filled porosity (21%), hydraulic conductivity (5524mm/h) and low bulk density (495kg/m(3)). The substrate also provided maximum support for the growth of Portulaca oleracea. Experiments with metal-contaminated influent from the down-flow of a packed reactor revealed that the green roof substrate possesses a high sorption capacity towards various metal ions.

AB The carbon chemistry of 10 profiles of peat soil has been described in detail using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The changes with depth in the allocation of signal to different carbon functional groups were consistent with an increase in the extent of decomposition (EOD) of the organic material with depth. This increase in EOD with depth is typical of peat soils. Incubation experiments were carried out on peats spanning the range of EODs encountered, to investigate the effect upon mineralization of substrate quality (as defined by 13C NMR spectroscopy), water content and particle size. The confounding factors of depth, water content, bulk density, aeration and carbon content were eliminated by incubating ground peat material in a sand matrix. The size of the mineralizable carbon pool and the rate of carbon mineralization were both significantly affected by substrate quality, water content and particle size. Substrate quality had the greatest effect upon the size of the mineralizable carbon pool: as substrate quality decreased, so too did the size of the mineralizable carbon pool. Water content had the greatest effect upon the rate of carbon mineralization, which increased and then decreased as water content increased, with a maximum rate constant at a volumetric water content of 0.37 cm3 cm-3.

ID INTRODUCED EARTHWORMS
AB The effects of earthworms on grass growth and soil structure in reclaimed peat were studied in a glasshouse bucket experiment, Cumulative grass yields from 13 cuts taken over a period of 20 months were 89% higher in organically fertilized and 19% higher in inorganically fertilized buckets with earthworms than in similarly fertilized buckets without earth worms. When fertilizers were withheld from some buckets after 7 months grass growth during the remainder of the study was significantly greater in the presence of earthworms under both organic (+222%) and inorganic (+114%) regimes. It is considered that grass growth responses were mainly due to enhanced organic matter decomposition and mineralization.
   Soil subsidence rates, hydraulic conductivity: moisture characteristics, bulk density, porosity, fibrosity, and soil morphology and micromorphology were significantly influenced by earthworm activity. The results show that earthworm activity can significantly accelerate the process of maturation and profile development in reclaimed peat soils.

AB While previous boreal peatland wildfire research has generally reported average organic soil burn depths ranging from 0.05 to 0.20m, here, we report on deep burning in a peatland in the Utikuma Complex forest fire (SWF-060, similar to 90000ha, May 2011) in the sub-humid climate of Alberta's Boreal Plains. Deep burning was prevalent at peatland margins, where average burn depths of 0.42 +/- 0.02m were fivefold greater than in the middle of the peatland. We examined adjacent unburned sections of the peatland to characterize the hydrological and hydrophysical conditions necessary to account for the observed burn depths. Our findings suggest that the peatland margin at this site represented a smouldering hotspot due to the effect of dynamic hydrological conditions on margin peat bulk density and moisture. Specifically, the coupling of dense peat (bulk density >100kgm(-3)) and low peat moisture (m <250%) at the peatland margin allowed for severe smouldering to propagate deep into the peat profile. We estimated that carbon release from this margin hotspot' ranged from 10 to 85kgCm(-2) (mean=27kgCm(-2)), accounting for similar to 80% of the total soil carbon loss from the peatland during the wildfire. As such, we suggest that current estimations of peatland carbon loss from wildfires that exclude (and/or miss) these hotspots' are likely underestimating total carbon emissions from peatland wildfires. We conclude that assessments of natural and managed peatland vulnerability to wildfire should focus on identifying dense peat on the landscape that is vulnerable to drying.

AB A peatland complex disturbed by berm construction in the 1950s was used to examine the long-term impact of water table (WT) manipulation on peatland hydraulic properties and moisture retention at three adjacent sites with increasing depth to WT (WET, INTermediate reference and DRY). Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) was found to decrease with depth by several orders of magnitude over a depth of 1-1.5m at all sites. The depth dependence of WT response to rainfall was similar across sites: WT response increased from 1:1 at the surface, to 5:1 at 50cm depth. While surface specific yield (S-y) values were similar across all sites, it decreased with depth at a rate of 0.014cm(-1) in hollows and 0.007cm(-1) in hummocks. Bulk density ((b)) exhibited similar depth-dependent trends as S-y and explains a high amount of variance (r(2)>0.69) in moisture retention across a range of pore water pressures (-15 to -500cm H2O). Because of higher (b), hollow peat had greater moisture retention, where site effects were minimal. However, the estimated residual water content for surface Sphagnum samples, while on average lower in hummocks (0.082m(3)m(-3)) versus hollows (0.087m(3)m(-3)), increased from WET (0.058m(3)m(-3)) to INT (0.088m(3)m(-3)) to DRY (0.108m(3)m(-3)) which has important implications for moisture stress under conditions of persistent WT drawdown. Given the potential importance of microtopographic succession for altering peatland hydraulic structure, our findings point to the need for a better understanding of what controls the relative height and proportional coverage of hummocks in relation to long-term disturbance-response dynamics.

AB This study deals with the change and evaluation of hydrological properties of peat soils (Histosols) in the course of soil development. Ash content, volumetric water content, and dry bulk density, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, water retention function, and wetting properties were measured for 84 fen sites in 19 fen regions of North-Eastern Germany. Soil development resulted in porosity decrease. On the contrary, the macropore space and the capillary rise increased. With the start of consolidation processes and the development of segregation structure, a noticeable reduction of the macropores and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were observed. In course of soil development and decreasing of aggregate size, these processes reversed. Both parameters increased from segregation structure horizon to earthyfied fen and weak moorshyfied fen horizon, until they partly exceeded the starting values of pedogenetic almost unchanged fen in strongly moorshyfied stadium. Differences in wetting properties of peat could not be explained by the changes of peat properties in the course of soil development.

AB Forest nursery production in containers in Mexico mainly uses peat moss, vermiculite and agrolite (standard mixture). Sawdust and pine bark are subproducts of the forest industry which can be used as substrates. The objective of this work was the characterization of five mixtures using pine bark, sawdust, peat moss, vermiculite. Evaluation included physical (bulk density, total porosity, air porosity and easily available water) and chemical (pH, electrical conductivity and cation exchange capacity) characterization. Bulk density varied from 0,31 to 0,51 g m(-3) while the standard mixture was 0,15 g m-3. Total porosity varied from 77 to 91% compared to the standard mixture with 84%. Air porosity varied from 8 to 20% compared to the standard mixture with 8%. Easily available water varied from 4,8 to 9,9% compared to the standard mixture with 17,7%. pH of the mixtures with bark and sawdust varied from 4,52 to 7,70 while the standard mixture was 3,87. Electrical conductivity varied from 1,84 to 2,69 ds m(-1) while the standard mixture was 1,13 ds m-1. Cation exchange capacity varied from 43,6 to 89,4 meq/100 g while the standard mixture was 60,4 meq/100 g.

AB United States Golf Association (USGA) specification putting greens are designed to limit excess soil water and compaction; but these soil properties change over time. Objectives were to define soil physical properties of sand- amended root-zones as affected by (i) rootzone mixture, (ii) establishment treatment, and (iii) putting green age. The USGA specification rootzones were built and established with Agrostis stolonifera L. in four sequential years. Rootzone treatments were 80:20 (v:v) sand and sphagnum peat and an 80:15:5 (v:v) sand, sphagnum peat, and soil. An accelerated establishment treatment applied 2.5, 3, and 2.5 times N, P, and K, levels, respectively, than the control treatment. Data were collected on rootzone particle size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat), bulk density, total, air-filled and capillary porosity for 8 yr, infiltration rate for 10 yr. All soil physical properties changed with age, but were not influenced by establishment treatment. Infiltration declined 73% but remained adequate (>= 0.15 m h(-1)) for location precipitation. Capillary porosity and bulk density increased 32 and 7%, respectively, while air-filled porosity decreased 38%. Capillary and air-filled porosity still met USGA specification after 8 yr. Addition of soil to the sand-based rootzone mixture had no negative effect on soil physical properties. Fine sand from topdressing and surface organic matter accumulation were thought to account for these changes.

AB Traditional peat sample preparation methods such as drying at high temperatures and milling may be unsuitable for Hg concentration determination in peats due to the possible presence of volatile Hg species, which could be lost during drying. Here, the effects of sample preparation and natural variation on measured Hg concentrations are investigated. Slight increases in mercury concentrations were observed in samples dried at room temperature and at 30 degreesC (6.7 and 2.48 ng kg(-1) h(-1), respectively), and slight decreases were observed in samples dried at 60, 90 and 105 degreesC (2.36, 3.12 and 8.52 ng kg(-1) h(-1), respectively), Fertilising the peat slightly increased Hg loss (3.08 ng kg(-1) h(-1) in NPK-fertilised peat compared to 0.28 ng kg(-1) h(-1) in unfertilised peat, when averaged over all temperatures used). Homogenising samples by grinding in a machine also caused a loss of Hg. A comparison of two Hg profiles from an Arctic peat core, measured in frozen samples and in air-dried samples, revealed that no Hg losses occurred upon air-drying. A comparison of Hg concentrations in several plant species that make up peat, showed that some species (Pinus mugo, Sphagnum recurvum and Pseudeuernia furfuracea) are particularly efficient Hg retainers. The disproportion ally high Hg concentrations in these species can cause considerable variation in Hg concentrations within a peat slice. The variation of water content (1.6% throughout 17-cm core, 0.97% in a 10 x 10 cm slice), bulk density (40% throughout 17-cm core, 15.6% in a 10 x 10 cm slice) and Hg concentration (20% in a 10 x 10 cm slice) in ombrotrophic peat were quantified in order to determine their relative importance as sources of analytical error. Experiments were carried out to determine a suitable peat analysis program using the Leco AMA 254, capable of determining mercury concentrations in solid samples. Finally, an analytical protocol for the determination of Hg concentrations in solid peat samples is proposed. This method allows correction for variation in factors such as vegetation type, bulk density, water content and Hg concentration in individual peat slices. Several subsamples from each peat slice are air dried, combined and measured for Hg using the AMA254, using a program of 30 s (drying), 125 s (decomposition) and 45 s (waiting). Bulk density and water content measurements are performed on every slice using separate subsamples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological response to climate change may alter the biogeochemical role that peatlands play in the global climate system, so an understanding of the nature and magnitude of this response is important. In 2002, the water table in a fen peatland near Quebec City was lowered by similar to 20 cm (Experimental site), and hydrological response was measured compared to Control (no manipulation) and Drained (previously drained c. 1994) sites. Because of the draw-down, the surface in the Experimental pool decreased 5, 15 and 20 cm in the ridge, lawn and mat, respectively, increasing bulk density by similar to 60% in the Experimental lawn. Hydraulic conductivity (K) generally decreased with depth and from Control (25-125 cm) 10(-1) to 10(-5) cm s(-1) to Experimental (25-125 cm) 10(-2) to 10-7 cm s(-1) and to Drained (25-75 cm) 10(-2) to 10(-6) cm(-6) s(-1). In similar topographic locations (ridge, lawn, mat), K trended Control > Experimental > Drained, usually by an order of magnitude at similar depths in similar topographic locations. Water table fluctuations in the Drained site averaged twice those of the Control site. The water table in the Control lawn remained at a stable depth relative to the surface (similar to - 1 cm) because the lawn peat floats with changes in water table position. However, the Drained lawn peat was more rigid because of the denser degraded peat, forcing the water to fluctuate relative to the surface and further enhancing peat decay and densification. This provides a positive feedback loop that could intensify further peat degradation, changing the carbon cycling dynamics. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID PROCESSED PIG MANURE; PLANT-GROWTH; EARTHWORM
AB Vermicompost is a suitable alternative for peat and other organic substrates as potting media. To examine the quality of this material with respect to plant growth requirements, vermicomposts were produced from different organic wastes including yard leaf (YL), sewage sludge + woodchips (SW), municipal wastes (MW), saw dust (SD), wheat straw + urea (SU), sugar cane filter cake (FC) and dairy cattle manure (CM). The chemical characteristics of the vermicomposts and the organic wastes were determined. The carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) and the electrical conductivity of wastes decreased during vermicomposting. For the materials with initial low C:N ratio (SW and MW), the N content decreased. Total concentrations of other nutrients in the vermicomposts were much higher than that of the original solid wastes. Some physical characteristics of potting mixes produced from mixing of 0, 15, 30, and 45 % (w/w) of the vermicomposts, soil, and sand were determined. Mixing of vermicomposts to potting media decreased the bulk density and particle density but increased the water holding capacity. In a green house trial, the growth of tomato seedlings on the potting mixes was investigated by determination of the shoot dry matter yield, the nutrient uptake, and nutrient content of leaves at flowering stage. Tomato growth in pots containing SW, MW and SU was higher than for other mixtures. Except N, the nutrient concentrations of the leaf samples were in the sufficiency range.

AB Drained peatlands are important sources of greenhouse gases and are rewetted to curb these emissions. We study one drained and one rewetted fen in terms of losses-and, after rewetting-gains of organic matter (OM), carbon (C), and peat thickness. We determined bulk density (BD) and ash/OM (and C/OM) ratios for 0.5 cm thick contiguous slices from peat monoliths to calculate losses. Whereas one site has lost 28.5 kg OM m(-2) corresponding to annual emissions of similar to 10 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1) over 50 years of effective drainage, the other site has lost 102 kg OM m(-2), corresponding to an annual loss of similar to 30 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1) for 30 years of intensive drainage and 6 t CO2 ha(-1) a(-1) during similar to 225 years of weak drainage before that. Height losses ranged from 43 to 162 cm. In the 20 years after rewetting, 2.12 kg C m(-2) was accumulated, equaling an average annual uptake of similar to 0.4 kg CO2 m(-2) a(-1). The results indicate that rewetting can lead to carbon accumulation in fens. This sink function is only small compared with the high emissions that are avoided through rewetting.

AB Pristine peat soils are characterized by large porosity, low density and large water and organic matter contents. Drainage and management practices change peat properties by oxidation, compaction and mineral matter additions. This study examined differences in physical properties (hydraulic conductivity, water retention curve, bulk density, porosity, von Post degree of decomposition) in soil profiles of two peatland forests, a cultivated peatland, a peat extraction area and two pristine mires originally within the same peatland area. Soil hydraulic conductivity of the drained sites (median hydraulic conductivities: 3.3 x 10(-5) m/s, 2.9 x 10(-8) m/s and 8.5 x 10(-8) m/s for the forests, the cultivated site and the peat extraction area, respectively) was predicted better by land use option than by soil physical parameters. Detailed physical measurements were accompanied by monitoring of the water levels between drains. The model 'DRAINMOD' was used to assess the hydrology and the rapid fluctuations seen in groundwater depths. Hydraulic conductivity values needed to match the simulation of observed depth to groundwater data were an order of magnitude greater than those determined in field measurements, suggesting that macropore flow was an important pathway at the study sites. The rapid response of depth to groundwater during rainfall events indicated a small effective porosity and this was supported by the small measured values of drainable porosity. This study highlighted the potential role of land use and macropore flow in controlling water table fluctuation and related processes in peat soils.

AB Warming in the boreal forest region has already led to changes in the fire regime. This may result in increasing fire frequency or severity in peatlands, which could cause these ecosystems to shift from a net sink of carbon (C) to a net source of C to the atmosphere. Similar to C cycling, peatlands serve as a net sink for mercury (Hg), which binds strongly to organic matter and accumulates in peat over time. This stored Hg is also susceptible to re-release to the atmosphere during peat fires. Here we investigate the physical properties that influence depth of burn in experimental peat columns and the resulting emissions of CO, CO2, CH4, and gaseous and particulate Hg. As expected, bulk density and soil moisture content were important controls on depth of burn, CO2 emissions, and CO emissions. However, our results show that CH4 and Hg emissions are insensitive to combustion temperature or fuel moisture content. Emissions during the burning of peat, across a wide range of moisture conditions, were associated with low particulate Hg and high gaseous Hg release. Due to strong correlations between total Hg and CO emissions and because high Hg emissions occurred despite incomplete combustion of total C, our results suggest that Hg release during peat burning is governed by the thermodynamics of Hg reduction more so than by the release of Hg associated with peat combustion. Our measured emissions ratios, particularly for CH4: CO2, are higher than values typically used in the upscaling of boreal forest or peatland fire emissions. These emission ratios have important implications not only for our understanding of smouldering chemistry, but also for potential influences of peat fires on the Earth's climate system.

AB A mixing model derived from first principles describes the bulk density ( BD) of intertidal wetland sediments as a function of loss on ignition (LOI). The model assumes that the bulk volume of sediment equates to the sum of self-packing volumes of organic and mineral components or BD = 1/[LOI/k(1) + (1-LOI)/k(2)], where k(1) and k(2) are the self-packing densities of the pure organic and inorganic components, respectively. The model explained 78% of the variability in total BD when fitted to 5075 measurements drawn from 33 wetlands distributed around the conterminous United States. The values of k(1) and k(2) were estimated to be 0.085 +/- 0.0007 g cm(-3) and 1.99 +/- 0.028 g cm(-3), respectively. Based on the fitted organic density (k(1)) and constrained by primary production, the model suggests that the maximum steady state accretion arising from the sequestration of refractory organic matter is <= 0.3 cm yr(-1). Thus, tidal peatlands are unlikely to indefinitely survive a higher rate of sea-level rise in the absence of a significant source of mineral sediment. Application of k(2) to a mineral sediment load typical of East and eastern Gulf Coast estuaries gives a vertical accretion rate from inorganic sediment of 0.2 cm yr(-1). Total steady state accretion is the sum of the parts and therefore should not be greater than 0.5 cm yr(-1) under the assumptions of the model. Accretion rates could deviate from this value depending on variation in plant productivity, root: shoot ratio, suspended sediment concentration, sediment-capture efficiency, and episodic events.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; POROUS-MEDIA; GROWTH; FLOW
AB The addition of Sphagnum to peat-based growing media ('Sphagnum replacement') influences plant performance. The primary physical effect of Sphagnum addition appears to be enhanced water retention. Good performance of plants cultivated in Sphagnum seems partly explainable in terms of its water retention properties. The large body of nutrient solution retained in Sphagnum can delay disadvantageous changes in its concentration during cultivation. The physical quantity of Sphagnum per unit volume, i.e. its bulk density, governs the volume of retained water and thus determines the strength of effects contributing to plant performance. When subjected to severe drought, plants cultivated in Sphagnum did not show clear signs of water deficit up to at least 1,572 hPa of matric suction, which is the estimated wilting point for plants grown in light peat. Using Sphagnum to replace peat in the growing medium appears advantageous to plants not only during drought but also during ordinary greenhouse cultivation.

AB Peat bogs play a large role in the global sequestration of C, and are often dominated by different Sphagnum species. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how Sphagnum vegetation in peat bogs will respond to global warming. We performed a greenhouse experiment to study the effect of four temperature treatments (11.2, 14.7, 18.0 and 21.4 degrees C) on the growth of four Sphagnum species: S. fuscum and S. balticum from a site in northern Sweden and S. magellanicum and S. cuspidatum from a site in southern Sweden. In addition, three combinations of these species were made to study the effect of temperature on competition. We found that all species increased their height increment and biomass production with an increase in temperature, while bulk densities were lower at higher temperatures. The hollow species S. cuspidatum was the least responsive species, whereas the hummock species S. fuscum increased biomass production 13-fold from the lowest to the highest temperature treatment in monocultures. Nutrient concentrations were higher at higher temperatures, especially N concentrations of S. fuscum and S. balticum increased compared to field values. Competition between S. cuspidatum and S. magellanicum was not influenced by temperature. The mixtures of S. balticum with S. fuscum and S. balticum with S. magellanicum showed that S. balticum was the stronger competitor, but it lost competitive advantage in the highest temperature treatment. These findings suggest that species abundances will shift in response to global warming, particularly at northern sites where hollow species will lose competitive strength relative to hummock species and southern species.

TI IMPROVEMENT IN SOIL STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH WHITE CLOVER
SO GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Note
AB Observations have been made which suggest that clover is more effective than ryegrass in developing rapid improvements in soil structure. To test this hypothesis, grass, grass/clover and clover swards were grown in undisturbed field cores. Significant differences in drainage rates and plant biomass production, and visible changes in soil structure, all supported the hypothesis that clover improves structure rapidly, but there were no significant differences in bulk density, porosity or aggregate stability between the treatments. Soil moisture characteristic curves of soil/peat/grit compost planted with grass, grass/clover or clover and grown for two years indicate that a more free-draining structure develops under clover than under grass due to a higher ratio of macro- to micropores.

AB Knowledge of past local to regional climate variability is a priority research area as the magnitude of climate change at these scales can be greater than at the global level. Peatlands are sensitive to hydro-climate change and represent a significant carbon (C) pool in the terrestrial biosphere. Here, we applied a multi-proxy approach (bulk density, loss on ignition, total organic carbon, testate amoebae, delta C-13 in Sphagnum, plant macrofossils, pollen and charcoal) and Bayesian statistics to a peat sequence from a mountain ombrogenous bog (Taul Muced) to explore how changes in hydrological conditions, peat plant composition and disturbances have affected long-term physical peat properties and the rate of C accumulation over the last ca. 8800 years. We found that C accumulation at this site ranged from 7 to 105 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (mean 23 +/- 14 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Climatic conditions exerted a direct influence on the peat's plant composition and subsequently affected C accumulation through litter characteristics and abundance, whereas disturbances had a weak effect. Carbon accumulation was greater (31 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) at times of wetter and warmer conditions when Sphagnum was dominant, and lower (17 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) during periods of mixed Sphagnum and vascular plant (mainly sedges) growth under drier/unstable hydrological conditions. Future climate projections of warmer temperatures and greater annual precipitation could therefore positively influence the C sink potential of this peatland. On the other hand, increased anthropogenic pressure in the future may negatively impact the C accumulation. Our study strengthens the geographical coverage of proxy reconstructions of past hydrological variability and highlights the carbon-sink capacity of mountain bogs in a so far understudied region.

AB Soil hydrothermal dynamics, resulting from the freezing and thawing processes in the active layer and their influencing factors, were studied in the upper Heihe River Basin (UHRB) in the Qilian Mountains, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Soil temperature and water content measurements were taken in the active layer of the UHRB in alpine grassland from 2013 to 2014. The results showed that the thaw rate of the active layer was significantly smaller in alpine paludal meadows than the thaw rate in alpine meadows and alpine steppes. This was mainly related to the hydrothermal properties of soils in the active layer, such as moisture content, thermal conductivity, and specific heat. During the thawing process, the active layer soil water content was higher and fluctuated less in alpine paludal meadows. Conversely, the soil water content was lower and fluctuated more significantly in alpine meadows and alpine steppes. These findings could be explained by the prevalence of peat soils, with a low bulk density, and high clay and organic matter content. By contrast, the soil particles in the active layer of alpine meadows and alpine steppes were significantly coarser, with higher bulk density and lower organic matter content. During the freezing process, gravel content and soil texture had a great impact on the unfrozen water content in the frozen soils. However, the factors influencing the soil water retention in frozen soils are complex, and further study is needed. These results provide theoretical support for the evaluation of the hydrological characteristics of the alpine permafrost zone in the Qilian Mountains. Furthermore, the effect of frozen ground on hydrological changes due to climate change in the Heihe River Basin can be simulated and predicted, providing a scientific basis for the ecological conservation of the Qilian Mountains National Park.

With the increase of depth, the vertical difference becomes smaller first and then starts increasing. Land reclamation reduces the soil organic carbon content and density, changing its distribution structure in topsoil. The average content of organic carbon in Caohai wetlands are as follows: lake bed silt > marsh wetland > farmland > woodland, the average organic carbon content of lake bed silt, marsh wetland, farmland and woodland are 16.40, 2.94, 1.81 and 1.08 %, respectively. Land reclamation reduces the organic carbon content of soil, therefore the conversion of cultivated lands to wetlands and the increase of forest coverage will help to fix the organic carbon in soil and increase its reserves.

TI Biosolids compost as component of potting media for bedding plants
SO GARTENBAUWISSENSCHAFT
LA English
DT Article
ID GROWTH; PEAT; CONSERVATION
AB Soilless potting substrates are increasingly used in greenhouse production of bedding plants replacing soil as growth media. These substrates usually consist of a mixture of organic materials like peat or p ne bark and inorganic substances such as perlite, vermiculite or sand. Among other possibilities, compost made from municipal and industrial sludges and other solid wastes can effectively replace both peat and soils as they imply little risk to human or to the environment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different proportions of biosolids compost in substrate mixtures on growth and quality performance for two bedding plants (Petunia hybrida and Vinca sp.). Pots containing different proportions (0 to 100%) of biosolids compost were used to grow both crops under greenhouse conditions. In plants were determined height, diameter, flower fresh weight, fresh aerial biomass without flowers, leaf area, flower area, number of floral stems, number of flowers, total N, P and K in aerial biomass without flowers. At the end of the experiment particle size distribution, bulk density, degree of compaction, water holding curves, pH, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen and available phosphorus were determined in substrates. Substrates with compost in its composition showed predominance of medium particle distribution. Bulk density and the degree of compaction were higher than the ideal range in treatment 75 to 100% of compost. The treatments 25 to 75% compost, were more adequate for normal water supply to roots. Substrates pH varied between 5.4 and 6.0, and the electrical conductivity (1:10) between 0.14 and 0.43dSm(-1). Both plants exhibited adequate vegetative and reproductive parameters in substrates composed of different proportion of compost of biosolids. In Petunia, the differences in plant parameters found among treatments can be mainly attributed to water availability and substrate salt content. Vinca was also related to water availability and substrate pH. Our results indicate that, in horticultural production, peat and soil can be partially replaced by biosolids compost. Considering the different plant parameters, the substrate with 25% of biosolids compost could be selected among those that produce the best plant quality in both studied species. The substrate made up of only compost of biosolids cannot be considered a commercial alternative.

TI Effect of soil type, peat and farmyard manure addition, slope and their

SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
LA English

ID ORGANIC-MATTER; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SPLASH DETACHMENT
AB A laboratory facility was built to quantify wash erosion by overland flow. The design allowed slope gradient and flow rate of water to be controlled. The apparatus was used to test the wash erosion from three Trinidadian soils (a sandy loam, a clay loam and another clay), four levels (0, 4%, 8%, and 12% by mass) each with peat and farmyard manure (FYM) and exposed to five slopes (9%, 15%, 21%, 25% and 30%). The aim of the test was to increase the general understanding of how peat and FYM affect the soil erosion process. The water content, bulk density and penetration resistance of the soils were measured prior to the measurement of wash erosion. As water content increased, bulk density decreased in all the three soils with increasing levels of peat and FYM. Although penetration resistance declined with increasing levels of added peat, it increased with increasing FYM content. Mean wash erosion increased from 0.99 kg for soils on a 9% slope to 1.88 kg for a 30% slope. Increasing levels of added peat and FYM decreased wash erosion at all combinations of parameters. Wash erosion was greater in the sandy loam and the clay loam than in the clay soil at the higher slopes (>15%). The opposite trend occurred at the lower slopes (9% and 15%), where soil loss was greater in the clay. Results from this study demonstrate that the effect of incorporation of peat and FYM on wash erosion depends on the type of soil, the soil slope, and the level of added organic material. Multiple linear regression equations were developed for predicting wash erosion from the experimental factors. The results of this study imply that for improved soil conservation, apart from adopting the land-use zoning of soils based on slopes, the incorporation of organic materials into steep arable slopes will greatly minimise soil erosion by water.

DT Article
DE atmospheric drying; drying chamber; peat density; milling; simulation
AB Milled peat production involves the atmospheric drying of a 20-30mm deep layer of milled peat (i.e. peat in a powder or crumb form) on the surface of the bog. Research from various sources indicates that the drying of rate of this layer is highly dependent upon its particle size distribution. Experiments were conducted to confirm this phenomenon for Irish peats.
   A drying chamber was constructed that enabled both climatic and material variables to be controlled. Three peat types were evaluated (viz. low (150 g/l), medium (240 g/l), and high (330 g/l) bulk density peats)for three particle size distributions (i.e. small (2.0-5.6 mm), medium (5.6-9.5 mm) and large (9.5-16mm)) diameter particles.
   Results showed that large diameter particles (viz 9.5-16 mm) dry some 10-25 % faster than smaller particles, depending on peat type. It is concluded that implementing a production regime that enabled the particle size of the milled layer to ba increased, from its current value of 5-10 mm, to 10-15 mm could be expected to increase drying rates by between 5 and 10%.

AB In this study, the use of composted sewage sludge (CSS) as a binary component with peat (P) in growth media for a horticultural crop, broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. Botryti cv. Marathon), was evaluated. Four treatments were established, based on the addition of increasing quantities of composted sewage sludge to peat (0%, 15%, 30% and 50%, v/v). Physical, physico-chemical and chemical analyses of the different mixtures of CSS and P were made. Plant growth, biomass production and macronutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg), micronutrient (Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn) and heavy metal (Pb, Ni, Cd, Cr) contents of plants were determined.
   The addition of CSS to P increased plant nutrient and heavy metal contents of plants and electrical conductivity (EC) and bulk density values of the substrates. The use of CSS did not affect the germination rate, even at 50% compost. For broccoli growth, the highest yield was obtained with the medium prepared by mixing the peat with 30% of compost; however, the mixture with the most sewage sludge compost (50%) had the greatest contents of macro and micronutrients.

AB The purpose of this study was to substitute sphagnum peat from plant growing media with urban biochar (UB) and evaluate its impact on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability. The UB was produced from the pyrolysis (650 degrees C) of a 2 : 1 ratio of biosolids to green waste. We compared three mixes -20% sphagnum peat mixed with composted pine bark (BO), 20% LIB mixed with composted pine bark (B20) and 60% LIB mixed with composted pine bark (B60) - for their ability to promote plant growth and minimise leaching losses in a greenhouse experiment using silverbeet (Beta vulgaris ssp. cicla). Plants were grown in 4.0-L custom-made chambers with the capacity to collect leachate and measure nitrous oxide gas flux. Both biochar mixes increased media pH, air filled porosity, bulk density and nutrient content relative to BO. The BO had the highest cation exchange capacity and electrical conductivity. The UB-based mixes, B20 and B60, had no significant effect on silverbeet biomass after 11 weeks of growth but had higher N use efficiency and P availability than BO. These results indicate that UB can completely replace sphagnum peat from growing media and can be used at the rate of 60% on volume basis while improving N and P availability. Using a higher rate of biochar in growing media has the additional advantage of sequestering more carbon and reducing urban waste streams and landfill costs.

AB Historic carbon accumulation rates in four bogs on a north to south transect from Sweden to Germany were calculated by using the bulk densities and carbon concentrations of 1-cm peat layers and a fine-resolution radiocarbon chronology. Carbon accumulation rates were compared to environmental data to explore the effects of climatic factors. Carbon accumulation rates in a period without clear human impact on the bog ecosystems (c. AD 1700-AD 1800) ranged from 25 g C/m(2)/yr in the most northern site to 50 g C/m(2)/yr in the southernmost site, which coincided with increasing annual temperatures from north to south. This suggests that temperature or growing season length is a major factor influencing carbon accumulation rates at different geographical sites. The temporal variations in carbon accumulation rates within the sites tentatively suggest that carbon accumulation rates may still increase with further warming in northern peat bogs, but decrease in southern peat bogs.

AB Imminent necessity for eco-friendly and low-cost substitutes to peat is a defiance in the soilless plant cultivation systems. Wood biochar could entirely or partly substitute peat as a plant growing constituent to produce vegetables. Nevertheless, knowledge concerning potential plant performance of leafy green vegetables grown on wood biochar is restricted. The present study assessed the main physicochemical traits of various growing media constituted by decreasing the content of peat and by increasing the percentages of poplar wood biochar. Yield, nutritional and functional properties of curly endive plants cultivated in a protected environment were also tested. Biochar was pyrolyzed from poplar (Populus nigra L.) at 450 or 700 degrees C for 48 h. Increasing biochar concentration and pyrolysis temperature resulted in higher pH, EC and K content of the growing mediums. Biochar was also effective in increasing particle density and bulk density. Biochar at 70% and pyrolysis temperature of 450 degrees C significantly increased head fresh weight by 47.4%, head height by 24.9%, stem diameter by 21.5% and number of leaves by 80.8%, respectively compared with the control (100% peat). Head dry matter content, root dry matter content, SSC, ascorbic acid and total phenolic were also significantly affected by this treatment. Furthermore, the addition of biochar and the use of higher pyrolysis temperature decreased N leaves concentration. This represents a particularly important target for leafy green vegetables healthiness.

AB There is growing interest in the restoration of blanket bogs that were afforested during the 1960s to 1980s, to avoid further loss of carbon to the atmosphere and to regain and defragment important blanket bog habitat. This paper reports the findings from a ten-year experiment in the UK to test the effectiveness of restoration treatments on water table depth, peat bulk density and water content, ground surface height and vegetation development. Treatments used were the six combinations of damming or not damming plough furrows with leaving the trees alive, felling and leaving them on the ground or felling and removing them. Combining felling with damming furrows was most successful in raising the water table, whether or not the felled trees were removed. Only where felling was combined with damming did the water table continue to recover between Years 5 and 10. Over ten years, the water level in these treatments rose to slightly below that of non-afforested reference bog at the same sites. This occurred as a rapid initial rise, following which there was only very slight further improvement. Felling caused the species composition of the vegetation to change towards that of the reference bogs. The process was slow, with the vegetation becoming more dissimilar to non-forested reference bog in the first five years and then becoming more similar to the reference bog after Year 5. Surprisingly, damming plough furrows had little effect on the vegetation except that, in combination with felling, it increased differentiation between the plough furrows and other positions on the ploughed ground. Conifer seedlings established on the restored plots, most densely where they adjoined standing forest, and had similar density and growth in all the felled treatments. The restoration treatments resulted in a decrease in bulk density and increase in water content of the upper peat, probably due to an unloading effect caused by the raised water table buoying up the drained peat layer. In some treatments this was amplified by removal of the weight of the trees. Damming the plough furrows caused a 5-7 cm rise in ground surface height, suggesting that subsidence resulting from primary consolidation and secondary compression is at least partly reversible.

For laboratory experiments, washed rootzone sand was amended at 15% (v/v) with either Canadian sphagnum peat (CSP), CC, or DE. Amendments reduced the bulk density and increased the total porosity of all mixtures. The DE mixture had the lowest Ksa, (41.9 cm h(-1)), which was attributed to the 2% by weight of particles <0.05 mm in. diameter. The inorganic mixtures retained 0.021 to 0.084 cm(3) cm(-3) less water than the CSP mixture at pressures less than -2.5 kPa. The CSP mixture held significantly more water in the entire profile and in the upper 15 cm compared with the inorganic mixtures and straight sand. Approximately 75% of the total water was lost within the first 15 min after drainage initiation for sand alone and the inorganic mixtures; only 65% was lost in the first 15 min for the CSP mixture. After 24 h of free drainage, the CC mixture lost the most water, while the DE mixture lost the least. Differences among the rootzone mixtures were measured in the first 3 min of drainage, with straight sand and the CC mixture having the greatest flow rate compared with DE and CSP mixtures. After 24 h of free drainage, the gravel layer remained saturated. For improved water retention in the rootzone, CSP remains the preferable amendment to sand when mixed at these ratios.

TI RETENTION CAPACITY OF DRY SOILS FOR NAPLS
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE PCE; TCE; GASOLINE; SOIL CONTAMINATION; RETENTION CAPACITY
AB Retention capacity values were measured in the laboratory for three non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), PCE, TCE and gasoline. The dry soils studied were sandy loam, clay, organic top soil and peat moss. For the conditions tested, it was determined that the retention capacity increased with an increase in the NAPL's density and the soil's porosity and a decrease in the soil bulk density. The largest observed retention capacity was for peat moss and PCE at approximately 7 g g-1. A simple model was developed to correlate the findings and allow estimation of the retention capacity values for different soils and NAPLs. Applications of the retention capacity model are illustrated with typical examples.

DT Article
DE thermal conductivity; soil; quartz; ice; water; air; density; snow
AB This paper presents a new method to seamlessly calculate thermal conductivity for various soil conditions, from loose to compact, organic to mineral, fine to coarse textured, frozen to unfrozen, and dry to wet. The soil is considered as a multi-phase system, containing air, water (liquid, ice), and particles finer (organic matter, minerals) and coarser (gravel) than 2 mm. The new method extends the general portability of the earlier Johansen (1975) method, and this generalization was fine-tuned empirically with data from soil, gravel, and peat drawn from recent and older literature, for frozen and unfrozen conditions from -30 to 30 degrees C, and for variable moisture and bulk density conditions from dry to saturated. Scatter plots between measured conductivity and best-fitted calculations consistently followed a straight 1:1 correspondence, with R-2 values generally above 0.90. The new method was then used to re-interpret thermal conductivity data involving wettable and non-wettable soils, in situ field measurements, and snow.

AB The last version of the ISTVS standards was published in the Journal of Terramechanics in 1977. Since then, the document has not been updated, although new concepts, techniques, testing procedures, and technology have been developed in the last 40 years, which renders some content of the 1977 ISTVS standards outdated and in-complete. The ISTVS identified as a priority the need to develop a set of standards for terminology and testing for modern day research on off-road mobility. This paper, for which the work has been funded in part by ISTVS, is an updated version of the 1977 ISTVS standards and covers a range of aspects in off-road mobility for: vehicles, tires, tracks, soil, wheels, modelling approaches, test methods, and equipment.

AB 1. Human activities have been a significant driver of environmental changes with tremendous consequences for carbon (C) dynamics. Peatlands are critical ecosystems because they store similar to 30% of the global soil organic C pool and are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic changes. The Zoige peatland on the eastern Tibet Plateau, as the largest alpine peatland in the world, accounts for 1 parts per thousand of global peat soil organic C storage. However, this peatland has experienced dramatic climate change including increased temperature and reduced precipitation in the past decades, which likely is responsible for a decline of the water-table and facilitated earthworm invasion, two major factors reducing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage of peatlands.
   2. Because earthworms often are more active in low-than in high-moisture peatlands, we hypothesized that the simultaneous occurrence of water-table decline and earthworm invasion would synergistically accelerate the release of SOC from peatland soil. We conducted a field experiment with a paired split-plot design, i.e. presence vs. absence of the invasive earthworms (Pheretima aspergillum) nested in drained vs. undrained plots, respectively, for 3 years within the homogenous Zoige peatland.
   3. Water-table decline significantly decreased soil water content and bulk density, resulting in a marked reduction of SOC storage. Moreover, consistent with our hypothesis, earthworm presence dramatically reduced SOC in the drained but not in the undrained peatland through the formation of deep burrows and decreasing bulk density of the lower soil layer over 3 years. The variation in SOC likely was due to changes in above-ground plant biomass, root growth and earthworm behaviour induced by the experimental treatments.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that incentive measures should be taken to prevent further water-table decline and earthworm invasion for maintaining the soil carbon pool in Zoige peatland. Artificial filling of drainage canals should be implemented to increase the water-table level, facilitating the recovery of drained peatlands. Moreover, the dispersal of earthworms and their cocoons attached to the roots of crop plants and tree saplings from low-lying areas to the Zoige region should be prevented.

AB 'Formosa' azalea (Rhododendron indicum) was grown for 4 months in 7.6-L (2 gal) containers in four substrate blends: 100% pine bark (PB) (by volume), I PB: I cotton gin compost (CGC), 3 PB: 1 CGC, and 3 PB: I peat (PT) at three irrigation levels [600, 1200, and 1800 mL(.)d(-1) (20.3, 40.6, and 60.9 fl oz/d)] in a polyethylene-covered greenhouse. Plants were evaluated for growth on a biweekly basis using a growth index. Roots were evaluated visually at the end of the study using a 0 (no root growth) to 5 (root bound) scale. Initial physical properties were determined and leachates were collected every 30 days. There was no difference in percent increase in growth across irrigation and substrate treatments. Visual root rating was greatest (4.5) for azaleas grown in 3 PB: I PT and least (3.5) in 1 PB: 1 CGC. The two PB/CGC blends improved water-holding capacity (W-HC) in comparison to 100% PB, with 1 PB: I CGC exhibiting the greatest WHC among all four substrates. Bulk density was greatest with the CGC-amended substrates. Leachate PH tended to increase and electrical conductivity (EC) tended to decrease with increasing irrigation volume. Leachates from the CGC-amended substrates were less acidic and EC tended to be similar or greater than leachates from the 100% PB and 3 PB: 1 PT substrates.

AB Biogeochemical processes in northern peatland ecosystems are influenced by seasonal temperature fluctuations that are changing with the climate. Methylmercury (MeHg), commonly produced in peatlands, affects downstream waters; therefore, it is important to understand how temperature transitions affect mercury (Hg) dynamics. We investigated how the freeze-thaw cycle influences belowground peat pore water total Hg (THg), MeHg, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Four large, intact peat columns were removed from an ombrotrophic peat bog and experimentally frozen and thawed. Pore water was sampled across seven depths in the peat columns during the freeze-thaw cycle and analyzed for THg, MeHg, and DOC concentrations. Freezing results showed increased concentrations of THg below the ice layers and limited change in MeHg concentrations. During thawing, THg concentrations significantly increased, whereas MeHg concentrations decreased. Limited bromide movement and depth decreases in THg and DOC concentrations were associated with increased bulk density and degree of humification in the peat. The experiment demonstrates the effects of the freeze-thaw cycle on Hg concentrations in northern peatlands. Changes to freeze-thaw cycles with climate change may exacerbate Hg cycling and transport processes in peatland environments.

AB The advance of Plasticulture requires the optimization of horticultural substrate.  Organic soils, as peat, are used internationally as a standard material in the making of substrates.  However, they can show limitations, as high water retention and low pH values.  This study measures the alterations in chemical and physical properties of peat ''lagoa-dos-patos'' (Viamao/RS) brought about by the addition of rice hulls.  The pure materials (T and C) and the mixtures (1T1C, 2T1C, 1T2C) were characterized by bulk density, particle size, dry matter, total porosity, air space, water holding capacity, pH value, soluble salt contents, cations exchange capacity and organic carbon content.  Carbonized rice hulls improved the peat ''lagoa-dos-patos''.  In the proportion 2:1 (C:T) the pH value was increased from 4.2 to 5.3.  The particle size of the mixtures was more homogeneous, the air space was increased and the residual water holding was reduced.

AB After the drainage of fens and their permanent use as meadows, peat-forming process is being replaced by moorshing (mucking) process (mineralization and humification of peat), and then by turf-forming process. Secondary succession of soil nematodes was examined by using the chronosequence of meadow sites (period I: 1978-1983) and also by analysing the same. sites 15-17 years later (period II: 1994-1997). The analysis was focused on the taxa (genera) of nematodes and on 19 to 29 parameters describing the community as total density, density of trophic groups, diversity indices and maturity indices, The pattern of successional changes was obtained for periods from. 2 to 117 years after drainage. Natural not-drained fens were used for comparison. Soil structure and soil processes occurring over the time considered can be characterized as follows: soil moisture (by weight) 80-52%, total soil porosity 90-77%, bulk density 0.16-0.44 (to 0.92) g cm(-3), total C content in soil 47-7%, total N content in soil 4.4-0.5%, ranges in the sequence from Mt I (poorly moorshified soils) to Mt III (strongly moorshified soils). In natural fens, soil moisture was 80%, soil porosity 90%, bulk density 0.15-0.35 g cm(-3), and peat-forming processes (Pt) were continued. As compared with natural fens, drainage and management of fens was associated with increasing density of total nematodes and their components such as bacterivores, fungivores, facultative plant feeders, obligate plant feeders, omnivores, and predators. In drained fens the density of nematodes declined with succession with the exception of omnivores. The increase in the density of omnivores was positively correlated with the number of years after drainage (r = 0.48, P<0.01). The indices of taxa diversity and maturity indices were positively correlated with years after drainage (P<0.001-0.05). In natural fens, ranges of density of all trophic groups were lower, and maturity indices higher than in drained peat meadows. The mechanisms driving the first stage of succession in nematode communities (until about 30 years after the drainage of fens) seem to be tolerance to the droughts and to the excess of nitrogen what was accompanied with higher density of herbivores (mainly Paratylenchus). In later stages, interspecific competition is likely to play a more important,role. Also a statistically significant relation was found of some taxa and parameters to peat type.

AB Climate change may cause increasing tree cover in boreal peatlands, and the impacts of this encroachment will be noted first at forested-to-open bog ecotones. We investigate key metrics of ecosystem function in five such ecotones at a peatland complex in Western Siberia. Stratigraphic analysis of three cores from one of these transects shows that the ecotone has been dynamic over time with evidence for recent expansion of forested peatland. We observed that the two alternative states for northern boreal peatlands (forested/open) clearly support distinct plant and microbial communities. These in turn drive and respond to a number of feedback mechanisms. This has led to steep ecological gradients across the ecotones. Tree cover was associated with lower water tables and pH, along with higher bulk density, aquatic carbon concentrations, and electrical conductivity. We propose that the conditions found in the forested peatland of Western Siberia make the carbon sink more vulnerable to warmer and drier conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrology and ecological linkages between Kheoheopalri lake and its surrounding watershed (area: 12 km(2)) in Sikkim were investigated to assess the long-term impacts of land-use/cover change on the hydrology of the lake ecosystem and bog formation around the glaciated lake. Significant land-use/cover change occurred in the past 4 decades. The bog area expanded by 67%, while the area under agriculture land in the lake watershed grew by 63% between 1988 and 1997. Overland flow was highest on the bare land (4.77% of the precipitation) and lowest in areas of cardamom-based agroforestry (1.79%). Soil and nutrient losses were highest in the cultivated area and least in the cardamom agroforestry system. Sediment loads of 345 Mg year(-1) were recorded at the lake inlet and of 316 Mg year(-1) at the outlet. Annual soil loss from the lake watershed was 502 Mg km(-2) and a net sediment deposition in the lake was 141 Mg year(-1). The lake received high nutrient loads (organic carbon of 10.2 Mg year(-1), total nitrogen of 1.01 Mg year(-1) and total phosphorus of 0.51 Mg year(-1)) from soil erosion and overland flow. The pH, total phosphorus and bulk density of the peat increased from the lake towards the bog-forest edge. This reflects the trapping of sediments and nutrients around the hog forest margin, although their retention is limited. Agricultural practices should be minimized in the upper part of the watershed and agroforestry practices should be: encouraged to maintain the health and longevity of the lake, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In general, soils and their pore size systems are assumed to be rigid during the loss of water on drying. In reality, it is not the case for most soils, especially for soils with high quantities of clay or organic matter. As a result of shrinking, there are changes in the bulk density, the porosity, the pore size distribution, and the hydraulic properties of these soils. Currently, only a few methods enable the shrinkage behavior of soil samples to be determined while simultaneously quantifying the corresponding soil hydraulic properties. Either the methods need proprietary software for data processing, the equipment used is expensive or the calculation of the hydraulic properties is executed by inverse modelling. The aim of this study was to develop an alternative, simplified method for the simultaneous and automatic determination of the soil hydraulic properties, taking shrinkage into account. The HYPROP (R) evaporative device was combined with a circumference meter. A preliminary investigation found that the diameter of the cylindrical samples used for the HYPROP decreased linearly during evaporation from the bottom to the top. To sum up, recording the perimeter change in the middle position of the sample during drying-out, together with the corresponding tension and water content, was sufficient to determine the hydraulic functions taking shrinkage into account. Measurements are presented for 6 samples which are different in texture and geological origin. The maximum shrinkage (19.5% by vol. between saturation and 5,000 hPa) was measured in the peat samples. The minimum shrinkage was quantified at 0.68% by vol. for the silty loam samples from Chile. The advantages of the method presented are: (1) the water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity function can be determined simultaneously in the range between saturation and close to the wilting point, at a high resolution and taking into consideration shrinkage; (2) the method and device are simple and robust to use; (3) little time is required for measurement, between 3 and at most 10 d; (4) the functions are described over the whole tension range, using more than 100 user-defined data points; (5) the evaluation of the volumetric soil water content measurement in shrinking soils is improved; and (6) common data models can be fitted to the hydraulic data as well as to the shrinkage data.

AB Smouldering ground fires have severe environmental implications. Their main effects are the release of large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere with loses of organic soil and its biota. Quantitative data on the behaviour of smouldering wildfires are very scarce and are needed to understand its ecological effects, to validate fuel consumption and smouldering propagation models and to develop danger-rating systems. We present, for the first time, a methodology for conducting smouldering experiments in field conditions. This method provides key data to investigate smouldering combustion dynamics, acquire fire behaviour metrics and obtain indicators for ecological effects of smouldering fires. It is to be applied in all types of undisturbed soils. The experimental protocol is based on a non-electric ignition source and the monitoring system relies on combining both point and surface specific temperature measurements. The methodology has been developed and applied by means of large series of replicate experiments in highly organic soils at the forest-grassland treeline of the Peruvian Andes. The soil tested exhibited weak ignition conditions. However, transition to oxidation phase was observed, with smouldering combustion during 9h at 15-cm depth and residence times at temperatures above dehydration of similar to 22h.

AB Testate amoebae inhabiting Sphagnum peatlands are sensitive indicators of substrate-moisture content. However, ecological data from a range of peatland types is needed to assess their indicator-value in other peatland systems. We examined testate amoeba communities and species-environment relationships at 40 locations within a pocosin of North Carolina. Primary objectives were to provide baseline data on the ecology of testate amoebae in pocosins, compare communities with those of northern peatlands, and assess the potential of using testate amoebae as environmental indicators in these systems. Results indicated that pH, substrate-moisture content, and conductivity were important controls on community composition. Communities that were relatively similar and dissimilar to those of northern peatlands were encountered, and the ecology of species with respect to water-table depth was similar in both peatland types. Cross validation of transfer functions for pH and water-table depth suggests that Pocosin testate amoebae can be used as indicators for these variables. However, water-table depth was poorly inferred from communities at several dry sites characterized by high bulk density. These sites may experience large seasonal or interannual variability in moisture conditions because of differences in peat structure, suggesting that research is needed on the influence of short-term variability in shaping community structure.

AB The protection of ecological functions of forested swamps and peatlands is the subject of legal and regulatory measures. In Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, wood harvesting is carried out on swamps and peatlands of merchantable forests. What is the impact of forestry practices on these wetlands hydrological functions such as sediment retention, groundwater recharge, flood reduction and low flow augmentation? The answer to this question is complex as the contribution of wetlands to these hydrological functions vary with each wetland type as underlined by the experts. With the aim of ascertaining the contribution of wetlands, and to infer the effects of forest management on forested swamps and peatlands, we carried out a literature review. The existing literature reviews only partially cover the subject or in the case of peatlands, they mainly consider drained sites. In this review, the links between the hydrologic functions and forest harvesting are treated by category of wetlands to take into account their anticipated specific contribution.

AB We characterized peat decomposition at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), Minnesota, USA, to a depth of 2m to ascertain the underlying chemical changes using Fourier transform infrared (FT IR) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy) and related these changes to decomposition proxies C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15, bulk density, and water content. FT IR determined that peat humification increased rapidly between 30 and 75cm, indicating a highly reactive intermediate-depth zone consistent with changes in C:N ratio, C-13 and N-15, bulk density, and water content. Peat decomposition at the MEF, especially in the intermediate-depth zone, is mainly characterized by preferential utilization of O-alkyl-C, carboxyl-C, and other oxygenated functionalities with a concomitant increase in the abundance of alkyl- and nitrogen-containing compounds. Below 75cm, less change was observed but aromatic functionalities and lignin accumulated with depth. Significant correlations with humification indices, identified by FT IR spectroscopy, were found for C:N ratios. Incubation studies at 22 degrees C revealed the highest methane production rates, greatest CH4:CO2 production ratios, and significant O-alkyl-C utilization within this 30 and 75cm zone. Oxygen-containing functionalities, especially O-alkyl-C, appear to serve as excellent proxies for soil decomposition rate and should be a sensitive indicator of the response of the solid phase peat to increased temperatures caused by climate change and the field study manipulations that are planned to occur at this site. Radiocarbon signatures of microbial respiration products in deeper pore waters at the MEF resembled the signatures of more modern dissolved organic carbon rather than solid phase peat, indicating that recently photosynthesized organic matter fueled the bulk of subsurface microbial respiration. These results indicate that carbon cycling at depth at the MEF is not isolated from surface processes.

AB Growth of Cuphea hyssopifolia, H.B.K. (Mexican Heather) transplants was evaluated in media containing 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100% compost derived from biosolids and yard trimmings. Compost was amended with a commercial coir- or peat-based media. As compost composition in peat- or coir-based media increased from 0 to 100%, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios decreased, and media stability, N mobilization, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) increased. Bulk density increased and percent moisture decreased as more compost was added to either peat- or coir-based media. Plants grown in media with high volumes of compost (75 or 100%) had reduced growth as compared to controls (no compost). However, regardless of the percentage of compost in either peat- or coir-based media, all plants were considered marketable after 8 weeks.

AB Thermokarst lakes and peat-accumulating drained lake basins cover a substantial portion of Arctic lowland landscapes, yet the role of thermokarst lake drainage and ensuing peat formation in landscape-scale carbon (C) budgets remains understudied. Here we use measurements of terrestrial peat thickness, bulk density, organic matter content, and basal radiocarbon age from permafrost cores, soil pits, and exposures in vegetated, drained lake basins to characterize regional lake drainage chronology, C accumulation rates, and the role of thermokarst-lake cycling in carbon dynamics throughout the Holocene on the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. Most detectable lake drainage events occurred within the last 4,000 years with the highest drainage frequency during the medieval climate anomaly. Peat accumulation rates were highest in young (50-500 years) drained lake basins (35.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and decreased exponentially with time since drainage to 9 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the oldest basins. Spatial analyses of terrestrial peat depth, basal peat radiocarbon ages, basin geomorphology, and satellite-derived land surface properties (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF)) from Landsat satellite data revealed significant relationships between peat thickness and mean basin NDVI or MNF. By upscaling observed relationships, we infer that drained thermokarst lake basins, covering 391 km(2) (76%) of the 515 km(2) study region, store 6.4-6.6 Tg organic C in drained lake basin terrestrial peat. Peat accumulation in drained lake basins likely serves to offset greenhouse gas release from thermokarst-impacted landscapes and should be incorporated in landscape-scale C budgets.

DT Article
ID METHANE STORAGE; ADSORPTION; MONOLITHS
AB Physicochemical regularities are studied for the synthesis of molded active carbons based on coconut shells and peat, with a latex emulsion and a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) sodium salt solution being used as binding agents. The materials are obtained at compacting pressures of 25, 50, and 100 MPa. The specific surface areas of the composite samples obtained from peat and coconut shells are S-BET approximate to 1320 and approximate to 1290 m(2)/g, respectively. The specific micropore volumes of the composites based on peat and coconut shells are W-0 = 0.50 and 0.45 cm(3)/g, respectively. Latex-modified carbon samples have a higher bulk density than those molded with CMC. The molding of the active carbons is accompanied by partial degradation of their porous structure. The Dubinin theory of volume filling of micropores (TVFM) has been employed to calculate the values of adsorption and active specific capacity of the molded adsorbents with respect to methane at a temperature of 273 K and a pressure of up to 100 bar. The experimental and calculated data have shown that the active capacity of the new microporous carbon composite materials may be as large as 180 m(3) (NTP)/m(3), when the pressure drops from 100 to 1 bar. It has been concluded that it is reasonable to employ the TVFM for preliminary calculations of the parameters of adsorption systems used for natural gas storage.

AB The Agricultural employment aboveground digestates or residues from anaerobic digestion can be used as an alternative to peat. The solid digestate poultry (called Poultry Methacompost: PMC) can be used as a partial substitute in the manufacture of culture substrates. The humified Organic Matter (OM) of mature substrates can be adopted only with the presence of necessary conditions for the development of the plant especially: respect of pH, percentage favorable of aeration, good sanitation, balanced contents of minerals. The present work aims to evaluate three different PMC from an industrial biomethaniser; one is obtained from the digester and the other two from the decanter (during two different periods). It appears from the physico-chemical characterization undertaken the following key results: In general, the PMC has a high bulk density, insufficient porosity of aeration, while the porosity of retention largely meets the standard. The phosphor and potassium are also eligible. The warranty of quality of PMC ensures greater acceptability and facilitates the incorporation with peat for soilless horticultural plants.

AB Permafrost deposits constitute a large organic carbon pool highly vulnerable to degradation and potential carbon release due to global warming. Permafrost sections along coastal and river bank exposures in NE Siberia were studied for organic matter (OM) characteristics and ice content. OM stored in Quaternary permafrost grew, accumulated, froze, partly decomposed, and refroze under different periglacial environments, reflected in specific biogeochemical and cryolithological features. OM in permafrost is represented by twigs, leaves, peat, grass roots, and plant detritus. The vertical distribution of total organic carbon (TOC) in exposures varies from 0.1 wt % of the dry sediment in fluvial deposits to 45 wt % in Holocene peats. Variations in OM parameters are related to changes in vegetation, bioproductivity, pedogenic processes, decomposition, and sedimentation rates during past climate variations. High TOC, high C/N, and low delta C-13 reflect less decomposed OM accumulated under wet, anaerobic soil conditions characteristic of interglacial and interstadial periods. Glacial and stadial periods are characterized by less variable, low TOC, low C/N, and high delta C-13 values indicating stable environments with reduced bioproductivity and stronger OM decomposition under dryer, aerobic soil conditions. Based on TOC data and updated information on bulk densities, we estimate average organic carbon inventories for ten different stratigraphic units in northeast Siberia, ranging from 7.2 kg C m(-3) for Early Weichselian fluvial deposits, to 33.2 kg C m(-3) for Middle Weichselian Ice Complex deposits, to 74.7 kg C m(-3) for Holocene peaty deposits. The resulting landscape average is likely about 25% lower than previously published permafrost carbon inventories.

AB The greenhouse-gas (GHG) balance of CH4 and N2O emissions and CO2 respiration in peatlands plays a key role in climate change. A GHG balance is mostly calculated from point measurements. In this study we propose and test a geophysical method of low frequency domain electromagnetic method (FDEM) as a proxy for forest-floor CO2 respiration and CH4 emissions in two 50 x 100 m drained peatlands in Estonia: a Downy birch and a Scots pine stand from April to September 2015. The FDEM measurement campaign in September 2015 yielded a detailed map of topsoil electrical conductivity. We explain the predictive power of FDEM on GHG emissions through relationships with dry bulk density of soil. Although we over- or underestimated some fluxes owing to soil heterogeneity, we composed reasonably credible GHG emission maps. The initial results seem promising and we recommend further application of FDEM methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ongoing reclamation of boreal forest areas that are impacted by oil sands mining involves the construction of wetlands as desirable land uses. Constructed wetlands receiving peat-mining runoff are known to be major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. However, the GHG fluxes of a fen that is constructed with drained peat substrate and receives runoff containing effluents of salt and naphthenic acids is not known. Using a fen constructed in the post-mining landscape of the Athabasca oil sands region, a study was conducted to quantify the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) during the peak growing seasons over the first two years following revegetation. The specific objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of revegetation strategies and other environmental characteristics on the fen GHG emissions over the growing season. Relative to a natural fen, our results show significantly lower fluxes of CH4 (p < 0.001), which correlate with higher bulk density, lower organic matter content, and higher pH and SO42- concentration in the constructed fen. Revegetation did not stimulate CH4 production, but increased CO2 uptake and reduced N2O emissions relative to the non-vegetated control. These results suggest that revegetation strategies and water chemistry might be more important controls on GHG fluxes than substrate quality in a constructed fen. Although the current edaphic conditions in the constructed fen support the potential for a net uptake of GHGs over the growing season, additional monitoring is required to evaluate if these conditions will persist in the long-term. We recommend that future reclamation projects should consider the potential effects of construction materials on water chemistry prior to use in fen reclamation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB High-resolution analyses of plant macrofossils, testate amoebae, pollen, mineral content, bulk density, and carbon and nitrogen were undertaken to examine the late Holocene dynamics of two permafrost peatlands in Abisko, Subarctic Sweden. The peat records were dated using tephrochronology, C-14 and Pb-210. Local plant succession and hydrological changes in peatlands were synchronous with climatic shifts, although autogenous plant succession towards ombrotrophic status during peatland development was also apparent. The Marooned peatland experienced a shift ca. 2250cal yr BP from rich to poor fen, as indicated by the appearance of Sphagnum fuscum. At Stordalen, a major shift to wetter conditions occurred between 500 and 250cal yr BP, probably associated with climate change during the Little Ice Age. During the last few decades, the testate amoeba data suggest a deepening of the water table and an increase in shrub pollen, coinciding with recent climate warming and the associated expansion of shrub communities across the Arctic. Rates of carbon accumulation vary greatly between the sites, illustrating the importance of local vegetation communities, hydrology and permafrost dynamics. Multiproxy data elucidate the palaeoecology of S. lindbergii and show that it indicates wet conditions in peatlands. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The influence of the addition of peat on arbuscular mycorrhizal formation and host plant growth was investigated using a pot experiment. Peat was mixed with Masa soil at different levels (0, 25, 50, 100, 1.50, 200 g kg(-1)) into which an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Gigaspora margarita Becker & Hall was inoculated, and seedlings of Miscanthus sinensis Anderess were planted. There was a significant increase in plant growth with increasing levels of peat. Root colonization and the number of proliferating spores increased with increasing levels of peat. By decreasing the bulk density, increasing the maximum water-holding capacity and the content of total nitrogen, peat addition considerably improved the physical and chemical properties of the soil, which might result in the promotion of plant growth and AMF activity.

TI The reserves and losses of organic carbon in the soils of Siberia
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The organic carbon database for the soils of Siberia has been developed. It includes data on humus content and bulk density determined in 5850 and 2300 soil pits, respectively. On the basis of these data we calculated the reserve of organic carbon in Siberian soils. It constitutes 199 x 10(9) t, or 13.1% of the total world pool. During the last century, the total loss of organic carbon from the plowed soils in Western Siberia amounted to 11.2 x 10(8) t, or 29% of the initial content. The losses induced by erosion and deflation reached 1.1 x 10(8) t, or 10% of the total loss. With the passage of time, the loss induced by mineralization decreases, whereas the soil erosion loss increases. Bog ecosystems of Western Siberia serve as sinks for carbon dioxide owing to the active accumulation of peat. Within the past century, the amount of carbon sequestered in peat deposits of Western Siberia has reached approximately 15 x 10(8) t, i.e., it is 1.5 times higher than the loss of organic carbon from the plowed soils within the same period.

AB After peat extraction cut-over surface usually consists of moderately to highly humified peat which undergoes secondary transformation due to severely disturbed water conditions. The study was carried out within a mountain bog (Polish Carpathian) located in Orava-Nowy Targ Basin, southern Poland. The objectives of the study was to determine physical, hydrophysical and chemical properties of the upper layer of soil on two post-extracted areas of different age and to identify correlations between hydrophysical parameters and re-vegetation pattern. Vegetation was analysed in two groups: bog forming (Sphagnum, others) and non-bog forming (true mosses, trees, others). Secondary transformation of peat was quantitatively described by water-holding capacity index W-1. It correlated with thickness of residual peat and a range of properties of cut-over peat (e.g. porosity, bulk density, soil moisture content, ash content). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated the key importance of water table depth, residual peat thickness and hydrophysical conditions of the cut-over peat, especially water-holding capacity index W-1, soil moisture content and macropore volume on re-vegetation by typical bog species. Correlation of W-1 index with soil properties and Sphagnum occurrence indicates that it can be a useful indicator in evaluation of secondary transformation of cut-over bogs and therefore the potential for spontaneous regeneration of typical bog vegetation.

AB The effect of spruce swamp forest (SSF) drainage and water regime restoration on soil organic matter (SOM) quality and soil microbial heterotrophic activities was studied in pristine, drained and restored SSF in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic. Sequential chemical SOM fractionation using cold and hot water and hot acid was used to separate SOM fractions according to their mobility and potential lability/recalcitrance, and Fourier transform infrared spectra were used for SOM characterization. Soil physicochemical parameters and heterotrophic microbial activities were also determined. Drainage of SSF had significant long-term effects (more than 50 yr) on plant communities and SOM quality. On drained sites, cover of sphagnum moss and sedge was much smaller than on pristine locations. A greater proportion of recalcitrant compounds and a smaller proportion of labile compounds were found in drained SSF as compared to pristine sites, which first led to an energy limitation and was followed by a decrease in microbial biomass and heterotrophic microbial activities (CO2 production, methanogenesis and methanotrophy). Restoration resulted in slow progressive changes in the vegetation cover, including the spread of sphagnum mosses, retreat of mosses typical of drier conditions and increased sedge cover compared with drained SSF. Moreover, soil physicochemical parameters (pH and bulk density), hot-water-extractable C and methanotrophic activity tended to evolve towards the pristine SSF and seem to be good indicators of the restoration process. No other SOM fractions changed significantly after restoration. Thus, to change significantly overall SOM quality and most microbial heterotrophic activities following restoration, more than 7 yr are required.

AB Eucalyptus growth was evaluated in five compost-based substrates formulated with different proportions of sewage sludge, coffee husk, peat, chicken manure, cattle manure, pine bark, sawdust, and coconut fiber, compared to two commercial substrates (CS). Organic wastes compost-based substrates (OWS) and CS were characterized regarding the available contents of macro and micronutrients, sodium (Na+), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and bulk density (BD). Substrate attributes and eucalyptus biomass production were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA) to detect patterns of clustering. The different proportions of organic wastes influenced the physico-chemical characteristics of OWS and, consequently, the eucalyptus biomass production. The highest biomass was observed in one of the CS that is rich in available boron (B) and calcium (Ca), less concentrated in most of the nutrients and with low EC and Na+ contents. The PCA allowed the verification that B availability was the attribute that explained most of the variation in eucalyptus biomass production.

AB Substitution of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default methodology by country-specific activity data is recommended for improved estimation of baseline soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and their changes. In the Republic of Ireland (ROI), previous studies focused either predominantly on grassland or on all land cover types but were depth-limited. To improve the accuracy, Tier 2 approaches are proposed by the IPCC. This requires an analysis of high spatial resolution databases (such as the Irish NSDB - National Soil Database) and maps, collated for major land cover, soil types and land use areas in Ireland. In this study, data were overlaid using ArcGIS to derive information for disaggregated soil types and agricultural land use areas. Empirical models were developed using separate measurement data to estimate the NSDB-derived SOC concentrations for deeper layers, using a depth distribution function and the bulk density (rho(d)) using pedotransfer functions. The soil type specific models (R-2=0.87-0.99) had an improved estimate of SOC densities when mineral and organic soils (peat) were treated separately. The estimated SOC densities for grasslands on mineral plus organo-mineral soils at the 0-10,0-30, 0-50 and 0-100 cm depths were 52.2, 127.1, 170.9 and 213.8 t C ha(-1), respectively. For arable lands, the corresponding SOC densities were 29.9, 81.3, 117.6 and 167.5 t C ha(-1). Nationally, for all soil types, the corresponding stocks (the products of SOC density and land cover area) were estimated to be 246.9, 608.1, 829.5 and 1079.3 Tg for grassland, and 13.5, 36.7, 50.2 and 67.0 Tg for arable lands in the three soil layers. The total national SOC stocks were estimated to be 888 at 0-30 cm and 1832 Tg at 0-100 cm reference depths. For the complete soil profile, including peats > 100 cm depth, the national estimate was 2824 Tg. The combined empirical models and Geographical Information System technique provide robust estimates of SOC stocks for disaggregated land covers and soil types, enabling Ireland to consider moving from Tier 1 to Tier 2 accounting methodology. This improved national inventory of the ROI is important for estimates of the C stock related to the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) categories. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) in permafrost terrain and the production of greenhouse gases is a key factor for understanding climate change-carbon feedbacks. Previous studies have shown that SOM decomposition is mostly controlled by soil temperature, soil moisture, and carbon-nitrogen ratio (C:N). However, focus has generally been on site-specific processes and little is known about variations in the controls on SOM decomposition across Arctic sites. For assessing SOM decomposition, we retrieved 241 samples from 101 soil profiles across three contrasting Arctic regions and incubated them in the laboratory under aerobic conditions. We assessed soil carbon losses (C-loss) five times during a 1year incubation. The incubated material consisted of near-surface active layer (AL(NS)), subsurface active layer (AL(SS)), peat, and permafrost samples. Samples were analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, water content, C-13, N-15, and dry bulk density (DBD). While no significant differences were observed between total AL(SS) and permafrost C-loss over 1year incubation (2.32.4% and 2.51.5% C-loss, respectively), AL(NS) samples showed higher C-loss (7.94.2%). DBD was the best explanatory parameter for active layer C-loss across sites. Additionally, results of permafrost samples show that C:N ratio can be used to characterize initial C-loss between sites. This data set on the influence of abiotic parameter on microbial SOM decomposition can improve model simulations of Arctic soil CO2 production by providing representative mean values of CO2 production rates and identifying standard parameters or proxies for upscaling potential CO2 production from site to regional scales.

TI Changes in the physical properties of drained peat soils after the
   application of sand
SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB To increase the fertility of drained peat soils and protect them from pyrogenic degradation, sand is often applied to their surface. The sand is either mixed with the material of the plow layer (mixed sanding) or is left on the soil surface to form a continuous sand cover. In both cases, the application of sand affects the physical properties of peat soils, including their bulk density, solid phase density, porosity, shrinkage capacity, and fissuring. The most pronounced changes in these properties take place upon the application of sand in the form of continuous surface cover. The additional pressure exerted by the sand and agricultural vehicles leads to the compaction of the subplow horizon. The hydraulic conductivity of the plow layer decreases by 20-25 times in comparison with the control, and its absolute values does not exceed 0.06 m/day. Under these conditions, an aquitard is formed at a shallow depth inducing the stagnation of gravitational water. This phenomenon suppresses the development of plants. Measures to protect drained peat soils from compaction are suggested.

AB Peatlands contain a large belowground carbon (C) stock in the biosphere, and their dynamics have important implications for the global carbon cycle. However, there are still large uncertainties in C stock estimates and poor understanding of C dynamics across timescales. Here I review different approaches and associated uncertainties of C stock estimates in the literature, and on the basis of the literature review my best estimate of C stocks and uncertainty is 500+/-100 (approximate range) gigatons of C (GtC) in northern peatlands. The greatest source of uncertainty for all the approaches is the lack or insufficient representation of data, including depth, bulk density and carbon accumulation data, especially from the world's large peatlands. Several ways to improve estimates of peat carbon stocks are also discussed in this paper, including the estimates of C stocks by regions and further utilizations of widely available basal peat ages.
   Changes in peatland carbon stocks over time, estimated using Sphagnum (peat moss) spore data and down-core peat accumulation records, show different patterns during the Holocene, and I argue that spore-based approach underestimates the abundance of peatlands in their early histories. Considering long-term peat decomposition using peat accumulation data allows estimates of net carbon sequestration rates by peatlands, or net (ecosystem) carbon balance (NECB), which indicates more than half of peat carbon (> 270 Gt C) was sequestrated before 7000 yr ago during the Holocene. Contemporary carbon flux studies at 5 peatland sites show much larger NECB during the last decade (32+/-7.8 (S.E.) g Cm-2 yr(-1)) than during the last 7000 yr (+/-11 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), as modeled from peat records across northern peatlands. This discrepancy highlights the urgent need for carbon accumulation data and process understanding, especially at decadal and centennial timescales, that would bridge current knowledge gaps and facilitate comparisons of NECB across all timescales.

AB Consecutive multiple disturbances to northern peatlands can dramatically impact peat hydrophysical properties. We examine the impact of a double disturbance (drainage and wildfire) on the hydrophysical and moisture retention properties of peat, a key regulator of peatland ecohydrological resilience, and compare this with the impact to each individual disturbance (drainage and wildfire). The compound effect of drainage and wildfire resulted in a shift of the surface datum down the peat profile, revealing denser peat. Less-dense near-surface peats that regulate water-table position and near-surface moisture content, both favourable to Sphagnum recolonization, were lost. At a drained peatland that was then subject to wildfire, peat bulk density increased by 14.1%, von Post humification class increased by two categories and water retention increased by 15.6%, compared with an adjacent burned but undrained (single disturbance) portion of the fen. We discuss the key hydrophysical metrics of peatland vulnerability and outline how they are affected by the isolated impacts of drainage and wildfire, as well as their combined effects. We demonstrate that multiple peatland disturbances have likely led to an increase in hydrological limitations to Sphagnum recovery, which may impact peatland ecohydrological resilience.

AB It is currently recommended to use buffer areas in reducing nutrient export from forested areas to water courses. Nutrient retention in buffer areas has been studied mostly by using artificial nutrient additions, hence information is needed from areas where the increased export originates from an actual forestry practice. We investigated the capacity of riparian buffer areas to reduce the ammonium (NH4-N) export originating from ditch network maintenance areas on boreal forested peatlands. Our results indicated that buffers are inefficient for reducing loadings that already are close to background levels of forested areas. In such a case, the buffer may even release NH4-N into through-flow waters. When the loading rate increased high above the background level, efficient reduction in NH4-N transport became possible. Besides the rate of ammonium loading, a factor behind efficient retention was the sufficient length of the buffer, whereas high volume of runoff decreased retention efficiency. Other buffer characteristics, such as the soil properties (bulk density, CEC), the tree stand structure, and the density of surface vegetation, were insignificant for ammonium retention efficiency.

AB A peat core from the Barschpfuhl kettlehole mire in north-east Germany was analysed for multiproxy indicators (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, testate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk density, loss on ignition), to investigate the effects of climate change and human impact on vegetation and peat accumulation during the last c. 300 years. C-14 wiggle-match dating was applied for high-precision dating. Testate amoebae assemblages were used to reconstruct past water table depths and compared with other proxies and instrumental climate data from the mid-18th century onwards. The mire hydrology of this relatively small bog was heavily influenced by forestry changes in the area. The climate signal was therefore obscured. Afforestation with fast-growing conifers and drainage for agricultural purposes resulted in a lowering of the water level, changes in trophic status, changes in mire surface vegetation and increased decomposition of the peat. Variations in the openness and cultivated land indicators in the pollen data of Barschpfuhl reflect regional population density and land use changes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We found that peat moss, amended with various ratios of pellets comprised of equal proportions of biochar and wood flour, generally had chemical and physical properties suitable for service as a substrate during nursery production of plants. High ratios of pellets to peat (> 50%) may be less desirable because of high C:N, high bulk density, swelling associated with water absorption, and low volumetric water content, whereas a mixture of 75% peat and 25% pellets had enhanced hydraulic conductivity and greater water availability at lower (<-10 kPa) matric potentials. Adding pellets to substrates used to grow plants in nurseries has potential to add value to biochar and thereby improve economic viability of pyrolysis. Moreover, biochar-amended substrates offer opportunity to sequester carbon as part of the normal outplanting process. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Little is known about recent rates of carbon storage in montane peatlands, particularly in the western United States. Here we report on recent rates of carbon accumulation (past 50 to 100 years) in montane groundwater-fed peatlands (fens) of Yosemite National Park in central California, U.S.A. Peat cores were collected at three sites ranging in elevation from 2070 to 2500 m. Core sections were analyzed for bulk density, % organic carbon, and Pb-210 activities for dating purposes. Organic carbon densities ranged from 0.026 to 0.065 g C cm(-3). Mean vertical accretion rates estimated using Pb-210 over the 50-year period from similar to 1960 to 2011 and the 100-year period from similar to 1910 to 2011 were 0.28 (standard deviation = +/- 0.09) and 0.18 (+/--0.04) cm yr(-1), respectively. Mean carbon accumulation rates over the 50- and 100-year periods were 95.4 (+/- 25.4) and 74.7 (+/- 17.2) g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Such rates are similar to recent rates of carbon accumulation in rich fens in western Canada, but more studies are needed to definitively establish both the similarities and differences in peat formation between boreal and temperate montane fens.

AB Smoldering combustion,of natural organic layers like peatlands leads to the largest fires on Earth. The multidimensional smoldering structure of peatlands is observed in the field, but the mechanism is poorly understood. In this work, a 2-D cylindrical axi-symmetric model that considers volume shrinkage is developed for the natural downward smoldering of peat with different inorganic contents. Numerical results show that the model captures the two-dimensional multisubfront structure of the peat smoldering process. For the peat with lower inorganic content, the predicted bidimensionality of wall attachment is more obvious, the mass loss rate and the spread rate are higher, and the smoldering front is thinner. For the peat with higher inorganic content, smoldering is more sensitive to lateral heat loss. Both the inorganic content and the lateral heat loss have negative effects on the volume shrinkage, peak temperature, and in-depth spread rate. Additionally, two groups of experiments using peat samples with added inorganic contents of 0% and 66.7% were conducted in an uninsulated furnace. Comparison of the numerical and experimental data shows that the model predicts the smoldering characteristics very well at lower inorganic content and qualitatively well at higher inorganic content. The predicted effects of the inorganic content and lateral heat loss on the peat smoldering process provide a theoretical basis for fire-fighting measures of smoldering peatlands with different levels of inorganics.

AB Interest in using alternative materials for potting substrate is increasing in response to availability and rising costs of peat and other conventional materials. Vermicompost (VC) is one such material. It is important to understand physical and chemical changes in potting substrate when amended with VC produced from different waste sources, pig (PVC) and beef cattle (BVC) manure in this study. Distribution of particles greater than 2 hurt. decreased, particles 0.5 to I turn increased, and particles less than 0.5 nun remained unchanged as PVC and BVC amendment increased. Dry bulk density and water-holding capacity increased with increasing PVC and BVC amendment. Porosity and air volume were inversely related to VC amendment, decreasing with increasing VC amendment. Saturated substrate extract sampling revealed nitrate nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, iron content as well as electrical conductivity increased with increasing PVC and BVC amendment.

AB This paper presents the results of multi-proxy research (pollen, plant macrofossil, testate amoebae and bulk density) on a 100-cm core collected from a Baltic raised bog in N Poland. The impact of the variability of the climate as well as human disturbance in the last 650 years on the development of the peat bog Kusowskie Bagno is described. Based on the results, the development of the raised bogs to the south of the southern coast of the Baltic Sea during the Little Ice Age occurred differently than in NW Europe. In NW Europe (e. g., Great Britain, Ireland, Denmark and N Germany) during the periods of climate cooling associated with lower solar activity, there was a characteristic wet phase, whereas N Poland was characterised by a dry phase. In the years AD 1450-1500, AD 1640-1720 and AD 1810-1840, which correlate with the periods of lower solar activity (the Sporer, Maunder and Dalton minima) and the periods of lower temperatures in Europe, the water table in Kusowskie Bagno decreased, and this was followed by changes in the vegetation. The largest drop in the water table occurred in the years AD 1640-1720. The dry phase resulted in the reduction of the population of Archerella flavum and Amphitrema wrightianum, which are organisms that are typical of wet habitats, and the appearance of, e.g., Arcella artocrea and Phryganella acropodia, which are indicators of dry habitats. The humidity decline halted the growth of Sphagnum sec. Cuspidata (Sph. cuspidatum and Sph. balticum) and Sphagnum magellanicum. At the same time, Eriophorum vaginatum, Baeothryon caespitosum and Pinus sylvestris appeared, and a dramatic increase in the bulk density is also observed. Since AD 1720, when the solar activity and the water table increased, the bog regenerated, and the population of Sphagnum fuscum/capillifolium developed. The development of the studied raised bog depended mainly on climate change. The increasing human impact in the area, which started in approximately AD 1320 and lasted for several centuries, was manifested in deforestation and in the increase in the surface area of farmland. However, this result did not have a significant impact on the development of the peat bog. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB The Atterberg limits are the most common tests specified by practising geotechnical engineers worldwide. These tests, which have physical meaning for fine-grained mineral soils, are regularly specified for peat and other highly organic soils despite fundamental issues regarding their appropriateness for such materials. These issues are explored in this briefing from which it is concluded that Atterberg limit concepts are inappropriate for peat and are unlikely to meaningfully correlate with mechanical (strength) behaviour. In assessing likely engineering behaviour of peat, a more useful suite of index tests is natural water content, organic content, fibre content and degree of humification. For correlations with strength and compressibility parameters, Dutch organic soil practice has found that water content and bulk density are usually sufficient.

AB Soil thermal conductivity (lambda) is frequently required when studying coupled heat and water transfer in soils. While lambda models are widely available for mineral soil, they are not as readily available for organic soil, which plays an increasingly significant role in climate change and carbon sequestration. This study used a heat-pulse method to measure the thermal properties of six soil peat:mineral mixes spanning wide ranges of water contents and bulk densities. Based on this, a new generalized lambda model was proposed, which was tested by fitting the model to heat-pulse measurements, and then comparing with several other widely-used empirical or physically-based models of lambda. The new model accounts for the effects of porosity, degree of saturation, organic matter content and soil texture on the thermal conductivity. It is capable of describing the measured data more effectively than other models due to its simplicity and applicability, as indicated by the lowest values of root mean square error (0.028 W m(-1) K-1) and the highest value of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (0.995). The new model has shown potential for use in studying numerical algorithms for describing coupled heat and mass transfer processes in a variety of multiphase soils. It can also be incorporated into global land surface models, particularly in terms of identifying the significance of peat soils on climate change and carbon sequestration.

AB Containerized black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) and white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) seedlings were grown from seed in Sphagnum media at two different degrees of humification (light and moderate) and at two artificially created textural grades (with or without particles < 1.3 mm).  During the 26-week growing period, the water content in the media was maintained at 60% of container capacity.  At the end of the growing period, white spruce seedlings grown in the peat media enriched in fine particles (< 1.3 mm) had a greater height, diameter, and root and shoot dry mass than those grown in peats deprived of fine particles.  The degree of humification per se had little influence on growth.  Black spruce seedlings, on the other hand, showed only a small increase in height with the addition of fine particles.  Significant (p < 0.05) linear relationships were found between physical properties of the media and final morphological measurements of white spruce:  between easily available water and both height (R = 0.97) and shoot dry weight (R = 0.98), and between air volume and stem diameter (R = -0.95).  Water relations parameters of black spruce and white spruce were largely unaffected by differences in the physical properties of the peat media.

The substrates were evaluated for their physical and chemical properties and their capacity to sustain growth of Lantana camara L. Physical and chemical evaluation included weight determination at saturation and at field capacity, bulk density determination, water retention, air filled porosity at 40 cm, pH and EC. When compared to the control (S) a weight reduction of 16.8%, 23.9% and 70.3% was obtained at field capacity with S:F, S:P:Per and P:F substrates respectively. Bulk density was reduced by 46%, 43% and 95%, in substrates S:F, S:P:Per and P:F, respectively, compared to the control substrate S. Air-filled porosity at 40 cm was slightly increased for substrate S:F while it was substantially increased for substrate P:F. The pH response between the initiation and the termination of the study was similar for the four substrates. EC decreased in substrates S and S:P:Per but increased in substrates S:F and P:F. Plant growth was monitored as shoot length, shoot number, main shoot diameter and the number of buds and flowers. Substrates S and S:F resulted in similar plant growth, while substrate S:F promoted flowering. Substrate S:P:Per induced slow plant growth during the first 6 months which subsequently increased resulting in a final growth that was satisfactory and comparable to the S and S:F substrates. Substrate P:F did not support sufficient plant growth and its use should be considered only in special cases where reduced weight of the roof garden is imperative.

TI The contribution of peat compaction to total basin subsidence:
   implications for the provision of accommodation space in organic-rich

AB Provision of accommodation space for aggradation in Holocene deltaic basins is usually ascribed to eustatic sea-level rise and/or land subsidence due to isostasy, tectonics or sediment compaction. Whereas many Holocene deltas contain peat, the relative contribution of peat compaction to total subsidence has not yet been quantified from field data covering an entire delta. Subsidence due to peat compaction potentially influences temporal and spatial sedimentation patterns, and therefore alluvial architecture. Quantification of the amount and rate of peat compaction was done based on (1) estimates of the initial dry bulk density of peat, derived from a relation between dry bulk density and organic-matter content of uncompacted peat samples and (2) radiocarbon-dated basal peat used to reconstruct initial levels of peat formation of currently subsided peat samples. In the Rhine-Meuse delta, peat compaction has contributed considerably to total basin subsidence. Depending on the thickness of the compressible sequence, weight of the overburden and organic-matter content of peat, subsidence of up to approximately 3 m in a 10-m thick Holocene sequence has been calculated. Calculated local subsidence rates of peat levels are up to 0.6 mm year-1, averaged over millennia, which are twice the estimated Holocene-averaged basin subsidence rates of 0.1-0.3 mm year-1 in the study area. Higher rates of subsidence due to compaction, on the order of a few mm year-1, occur over decades to centuries, following a substantial increase in effective stress caused by sediment loading. Without such an increase in effective stress, peat layers may accumulate for thousands of years with little compaction. Thus, the contribution of peat compaction to total delta subsidence is variable in time. Locally, up to 40% of total Holocene accommodation space has been provided by peat compaction. Implications of the large amount of accommodation space created by peat compaction in deltaic basins are: (1) increased sediment trap efficiency in deltas, which decelerates delta progradation and enhances the formation of relatively thick clastic sequences and (2) enhanced local formation of thick natural levees by renewing existing accommodation space.

AB Because peat has high organic content and high natural water content, it is potentially problematic for civil engineering projects involving construction on peatland. Therefore, it is important to understand the physical, chemical and geotechnical properties of the peat. The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the properties of two Iranian peat types. Peat and water samples were collected from sites within two extensive wetland areas (Chaghakhor Wetland and Gavkhuni Swamp) where construction works are planned. Both sites had peat layers more than three metres thick, which were sampled at depths of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0 metres below ground level with four replicates per site. Degree of humification was determined in the field. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the pH of water and peat; and the natural (field) moisture content, organic content, ash content, bulk density, dry density, density of solids, liquid limit, initial void ratio, linear shrinkage, unconfined compressive strength, shear strength and falling-head permeability of each peat sample. We also investigated the elemental compositions and microstructure of the peats using X-Ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy. The laboratory tests of physical and geotechnical properties indicated that, for construction purposes, Chaghakhor peat is weaker than Gavkhuni peat.

AB To constrain the effect of climate and peatland type on carbon accumulation, we reconstructed these parameters from a Holocene-length core of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland near Cordova, AK, USA. We determined peat type using a combination of peat texture and density, macrofossils, distributions of leaf-wax biomarkers, and soil pH reconstructions based on distributions of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipids (brGDGTs). We produced an independent record of hydroclimate and temperature change using hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf-wax biomarkers and distributions of brGDGTs. Carbon accumulation rates were constrained with 14 AMS C-14 dates from identified macrofossils and ash-free bulk density. In the early Holocene, the site was a shallow pond with evidence for emergent macrophytes, Sphagnum, and algae growing in a warm, moist climate. At 9.2 kyr (1 kyr = 1000 cal. yr BP), the site became a Sphagnum-dominated bog. Under mid-Holocene warm, evaporative climate conditions, the site became sedge-dominated. As climate cooled and effective precipitation increased, Sphagnum was able to gain dominance abruptly at similar to 3.5 kyr. Large changes in the vegetation assemblage and hydrology and climate are contemporaneous with significant changes in the rate of carbon accumulation. Carbon accumulated most rapidly when Sphagnum dominated and effective moisture was high and most slowly when sedges were dominant and conditions were warmer and drier. Estimates of future climate change indicate warmer, more evaporative conditions that, in the past, favored a sedge-dominated environment, suggesting that this peatland and those similar can contribute to a positive feedback to warming by transitioning to less efficient carbon sinks.

AB Gradients in acidity-alkalinity and nutrient availability were studied in 2 Sphagnum-dominated peatlands on the southeastern Italian Alps. Decreasing concentrations of most mineral elements (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Al3+ and Si4+) in pore water indicated a progressively lower influx of mineral-soil water from the slightly minerotrophic conditions in the peatland margins to ombrogenous conditions in the central part of the peattands. This was paralleled by decreasing concentrations of ash, bulk density, Ca, Fe and, partly, Mn in the peat. The nutrient gradient, as defined by pore water concentrations of N and P, was largely independent of the acidity-alkalinity gradient: NO3- and PO43- had similar concentrations throughout the gradient, whereas NH4+ concentrations increased with increasing pore-water pH. In contrast, the peat nutrient gradient coincided with the acidity-alkalinity gradient, with total concentrations of N and P decreasing from the margin to the centre. Bryophytes and vascular plants had different responses along the acidity-alkalinity gradient and the nutrient gradient. Bryophyte distribution reflected the acidity-alkalinity gradient both in pore water and in peat. Vascular plant distribution was mainly influenced by variations in nutrient availability.

AB This article focuses on constructing a high-resolution age-depth model for the Puscizna Mala peat bog located in Orawa-Nowy Targ Basin (S Poland). The chronology was established on the basis of both Pb-210 and C-14 measurements, and further confirmed by pollen diagrams and the peat bulk composition (density, ash content, and measurements of C, N, S). The Cs-137 profile revealed significant downward migration of this radionuclide and was not suitable for geochronological interpretation. The peat profile in southern Poland records almost 2000 yr of paleoecological and geochemical changes. Major historical events linked to anthropogenic and climatic changes are recorded in the investigated proxies, which confirm the reliability of the age-depth model. Specifically, the Roman period, Migration period, Medieval times, as well as the Industrial Revolution are reflected in the palynology and bulk composition of the peat. However, dating results obtained for the core segment between 22-45 cm are problematic when confronted with other analyses. The highest peat accumulation rate of 2 mm yr(-1) (AD 1300-1400 according to the age-depth model) is not compatible with the section of the highest peat decomposition revealed by lithological description. Moreover, the onset of a drastic decline of forests reflected in the palynological data and dated to AD 1280-1340 (40 cm) is difficult to explain in the light of historical data. Therefore, the lithology, bulk density, and pollen were used to validate the obtained age-depth model. External forcing factors on the peat formation process may be indicated, including agricultural activity, water-level fluctuations, and natural climatic factors, which paradoxically caused doubling of the obtained peat accumulation rate.

AB The rising cost of peat and pine bark has boosted the demand for alternative organic materials for container growing media. Here, composts of invasive acacia (Acacia longifolia and Acacia melanoxylon) residues were evaluated as alternative organic materials for horticultural substrates. Compost bulk density was less than 0.4gcm(-3) and total pore space was more than 85 percent of the total volume, as established for an ideal substrate. The matured acacia compost air capacity, easily available water, buffering capacity, and total water-holding capacity were also within acceptable recommended values. With increased composting time the physical characteristics of the composts were improved, but the same was not true for chemical characteristics such as pH and electrical conductivity. The replacement of pine bark compost by acacia compost in a commercial substrate did not negatively affect either lettuce emergence or lettuce growth, suggesting that acacia compost can be successfully used as an alternative component for horticultural substrates.

AB Northern peatlands are important global carbon stores, but there is concern that these boreal peat reserves are at risk due to increased fire frequency and severity as predicted by climate change models. In a subhumid climate, hydrogeological position is an important control on peatland hydrology and wildfire vulnerability. Consequently, we hypothesized that in a coarse-textured glaciofluvial outwash, isolated peatlands lacking the moderating effect of large-scale groundwater flow would have greater water table (WT) variability and would also be more vulnerable to deep WT drawdown and wildfire during dry climate cycles. A holistic approach was taken to evaluate 3 well-accepted factors that are associated with smouldering in boreal peatlands: hollow microform coverage, peatland margin morphometry, and gravimetric water content. Using a combination of field measurements (bulk density, humification, WT position, hummock-hollow distribution, and margin width) and modelling (1-D vertical unsaturated flow coupled with a simple peat-fuel energy balance equation), we assessed the vulnerability of peat to smouldering. We found that a peatland in the regionally intermediate topographic position is the most vulnerable to smouldering due to the interaction of variable connectivity to large-scale groundwater flow and the absence of mineral stratigraphy for limiting WT declines during dry conditions. Our findings represent a novel assessment framework and tool for fire managers by providing a priori knowledge of potential peat smouldering hot spot locations in the landscape to efficiently allocate resources and reduce emergency response time to smouldering events.

AB The reclamation of fen peatlands on post-oil sand development landscapes involves the transfer of peat from a donor fen to form the upper 2 m of a sediments-filled pit resulting from open-pit mining. The placed peat serves two major functions of attenuating the upwelling of dissolved solutes from the underlying tailing sediments to the rooting zone, and as fen vegetation establishment substrate. However, the modifications (e.g., decomposition and fragmentation) resulting from salvage and transfer practices (e.g., dewatering and loading/placement with earth-moving equipment) could impact the potentials of the placed peat to support ecohydrological functions in the constructed fen. Thus, we conducted a study to evaluate the impact of these practices on the biogeochemical and hydrologic functioning of a constructed fen. Peat cores were extracted along transects in the donor fen before peat transfer, and after placement in the constructed fen. Cores were also taken from a natural reference site to serve as the nearest possible comparison to donor site conditions prior to dewatering. The cores were subsampled and analyzed for selected physicochemical and hydrophysical properties. Relative to the reference site, our results indicates a higher surface bulk density, and accelerated mineralization of organic-bound nutrients in the dewatered donor peat. Following transfer of peat to the constructed fen, changes in hydrophysical properties were reflected in a reduction of the horizontal/vertical anisotropy ratio from 1.5 to 1, which could impact the vertical fluxes of water. However this impact is likely less than that of the heterogeneity associated with the fragmentation of the placed peat. Hence, we recommend some management practices that can alleviate the modifications resulting from contemporary operational practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial communities play crucial roles in the global carbon cycle, particularly in peatland ecosystems under climate change. The peatlands of the Sanjiang Plain could be highly vulnerable to global warming because they are mainly located at the southern limit of northern peatlands. In this study, the alpha diversity and composition of bacterial communities in three different minerotrophic fens along a chronosequence were investigated. We captured a rich microbial community that included many rare operational taxonomic units (OTUs) but was dominated by a few bacterial classes that have frequently been detected in other peatland ecosystems. Notably, a large diversity of methanotrophs affiliated with Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria was also detected. Bacterial alpha diversity and composition varied as a function of peat depth and its associated physical-chemical properties, such as total carbon, total nitrogen, pH and bulk density. We also found that bacterial community turnover (beta diversity) to be significantly correlated with soil age, whereas bacterial alpha diversity was not.

AB This study considers the spatial variability of soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage in a drained alpine wetland and the possible relationships with soil properties. Top 0-0.30 m soil samples were collected in a typical alpine wetland in the south-eastern Qinghai-Tibet plateau using grid sampling. There was high spatial variability for soil organic carbon density (SOCD), soil total nitrogen density (STND), and soil total phosphorous density (STPD) in the drained alpine wetland. Spherical models best described the structure of the semivariograms for SOCD and STPD, and an exponential model for STND, with the range parameter of <4 m. Similar spatial distribution with lower or higher patches of C, N, and P storage were observed. SOCD, STND, and STPD were significantly negatively correlated with soil moisture (P<0.01), and significantly positively correlated with bulk density (P<0.01). However, no significant correlations were observed between SOCD, STND, and STPD and soil pH values. Wetland drainage might lead to higher C, N, and P densities in top 0.30 m soils due to peat compaction; thus, it is necessary to incorporate water table fluctuations or the whole depth of peat layers to estimating precisely C, N and P storage.

AB The approaches of multivariate statistics have been used for the numerical classification of morphogenetic types of moss litters in swampy spruce forests according to their physicochemical properties (the ash content, decomposition degree, bulk density, pH, mass, and thickness). Three clusters of moss litters- peat, peaty, and high-ash peaty-have been specified. The functions of classification for identification of new objects have been calculated and evaluated. The degree of decomposition and the ash content are the main classification parameters of litters, though all other characteristics are also statistically significant. The final prediction accuracy of the assignment of a litter to a particular cluster is 86%. Two leading factors participating in the clustering of litters have been determined. The first factor-the degree of transformation of plant remains (quality)-specifies 49% of the total variance, and the second factor-the accumulation rate (quantity)- specifies 26% of the total variance. The morphogenetic structure and physicochemical properties of the clusters of moss litters are characterized.

AB This study evaluates the hydrological conditions in a harvested bog where various water management schemes have been implemented to ameliorate conditions limiting Sphagnum regeneration. The study sites included a natural bog (natural), a recently drained and harvested bog (drained), which provided the hydrological extremes. Also included are a drained harvested bog with ditches blocked with (1) no other management (blocked), (2) peat bounded by open water at 5-m intervals (5-m), and (3) with straw mulch on the surface (mulch).
   The study period from May to September 1995 was drier than normal. The water table in the drained site descended to -107 cm by late August, compared with -72.5 cm at the blocked site. Both the 5-m and mulch sites (ditches also blocked) had water table recessions similar to the natural site (minimum approx. 62 cm). In the drained and blocked sites, little variation in water table depth occurred after early July, suggesting water exchanges with the atmosphere occurred to and from the unsaturated zone only. Soil moisture in the upper 3 cm layer on the drained and blocked site were similar, in spite of greatly different water table depths, dropping below 20% by volume, compared with a minimum of 30% when mulch was used. Soil water tension profiles suggest most of this storage change occurred in the upper 30 cm. The water table depth, therefore, was not a good indicator of water availability at the surface.
   Pressure head in the unsaturated zone (1 cm below the surface) in the drained and blocked sites was maintained between 0 and -100 cm (mb) 18 and 34% of the time, respectively, and with water management with open water (5-m) and mulch, increased to 55 and 97% of the time, respectively. The greatest tension, however, was observed on the blocked site (-355 cm), rather than the drained site (-247 cm), suggesting lower suitability for Sphagnum at the former. This was attributed to the higher bulk density (hence smaller pore structure) at the blocked site (rho(b) = 92.1 kg compared with 55.7 kg m(-3)). Higher bulk density at the blocked site was ascribed to its longer time since disturbance. This implies' restoration should begin as soon as possible after harvesting is finished.

AB Hollow-ridge microrelief is a typical surface pattern of raised bogs in the Boreal zone. It may play an essential role in maintaining the balance between bog ecosystems and changing environmental conditions. The data of the location, depth, approximate age, area and length/width ratio of 225 hollows and reconstructions of the shape dynamics of eight hollows from six bogs in Estonia were used to study the dynamics of the formation and development of hollows. The approximate age of hollows was established according to their depth and pear age isolines calculated by the bulk density method and based on radiocarbon dating. The first period of intensive hollow formation in the bogs studied occurred 3200-2800 years ago. The second, still continuing period of intensive hollow formation started c.1800 years ago; No correlation was detected between the temporal distribution of hollows on different profiles within one bog or in different bogs. Therefore, the formation of the hollows could have been initiated by extra-local random factors supported by the cool wet climate. Almost synchronous widening of the area of hollows in different bogs in Estonia about 1600-1400, 1100-900 and 600-400 years ago is contemporaneous with cool and or wet climatic periods and was probably initiated by climatic changes.

AB Plugs of impatiens (impatiens walleriana Hook.f.), salvia (Salvia splendens Sellow ex Roem. & Schult.), and vinca (Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don) were transplanted into containers filled with commercial Sphagnum peat moss plus perlite medium (Sunshine Mix #1) or arboretum and greenhouse waste compost (CT), Sphagnum peat moss (PS), and perlite (PE) medium at percentages of (by Vol.) 50:50 PSYE and 75:25 PS:PE (controls). CT media included 25:50:25, 25:25:50, and 50:25:25 CT:PS:PE, or 50:50 and 75:25 CT:PE. Shoot dry weight of vinca and impatiens and stem diameter of vinca were greater for 25:50:25 CT:PS:PE than controls. Shoot dry weight and stem diameter of salvia were similar for CT media and controls. CT additions increased bulk density but decreased particle sizes, total porosity, and container capacity. It was concluded that CT-growing methodology could be implemented without loss of plant quality, although physical media characteristics limit the amount of compost and component ranges within container media.

AB Several factors can affect the integrity of natural archives such as peat records, e.g., decomposition and nutrient cycling, and it has also been hypothesized that some rapid downward transport of atmospherically derived elements may occur. We test this hypothesis by analyzing the short-lived, natural tracer beryllium-7 (tA1/2A = 53.4 days) in five cores from two peatlands. In triplicate hummock cores from a raised bog in southern Sweden, Be-7 could be measured to 20, 18 and 8 cm depth, and in a nutrient-poor mire in northern Sweden to a depth of 16 cm in a Sphagnum lawn core, but only 4 cm in the dominant, more-decomposed fen peat, indicating some spatial variability both within and between sites. Total Be-7 inventories were 320-450 Bq m(-2) in the bog, and 150 Bq m(-2) (lawn) and 240 Bq m(-2) (fen peat) in the mire. 25-79 % of the total inventory of Be-7 was located in the upper 2-cm layer. To further test downwashing, in the laboratory we applied a CuBr-solution to two cores and a Cu-solution to one core taken from the mire Sphagnum lawn, all with low water table conditions. About 50 % of the added Cu and similar to 35 % of the added Br were retained in the surface (2 cm) layer; 1-3 % of the Cu was found at 8-12 cm depth and similar to 1 % of the Br was measured in the lowest level (20-22 cm). Based on our novel approach using Be-7 and experimental work we show that short-term downwashing can occur in peatlands and we suggest the depth of this will depend on the properties of the peat, e.g., bulk density and decomposition, as well as hydrology.

   CONTENT
AB Sphagnum (spp.) is widely distributed in permafrost regions around the arctic and subarctic. The moisture content of the moss layer affects the thermal insulative capacity and preservation of permafrost. It also controls the growth and collapse history of palsas and other peat mounds, and is relevant, in general terms, to permafrost thaw (thermokarst). In this study, we test and calibrate seven different soil moisture sensors for measuring the moisture content of Sphagnum moss under laboratory conditions. The soil volume to which each probe is sensitive is one of the important parameters influencing moisture measurement, particularly in a heterogeneous medium such as moss.
   Each sensor has a unique response to changing moisture content levels, solution salinity, moss bulk density and to the orientation (structure) of the Sphagnum relative to the sensor. All of the probes examined here require unique polynomial calibration equations to obtain moisture content from probe output. We provide polynomial equations for dead and live Sphagnum moss (R-2 > 0.99). Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Due to human activity, large amounts of organic residue are generated daily. Therefore, an adequate use in agricultural activities requires the characterization of the main properties. The chemical and physical characterization is important when planning the use and management of organic residue. In this study, chemical and physical properties of charcoal, coffee husk, pine-bark, cattle manure, chicken manure, coconut fiber, sewage sludge, peat, and vermiculite were determined. The following properties were analyzed: N-NH4+, N-N0(3)(-), and total concentrations of N, P, S, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B, as well as pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC) and bulk density. Coffee husk, sewage sludge, chicken manure and cattle manure were generally richer in nutrients. The EC values of these residues were also the highest (0.08 - 40.6 dS m(-1)). Peat and sewage sludge had the highest bulky density. Sodium contents varied from 0 to 4.75 g kg(-1), with the highest levels in chicken manure, cattle manure and sewage sludge. Great care must be taken when establishing proportions of organic residues in the production of substrates with coffee husk, cattle or chicken manure or sewage sludge in the calculation of the applied fertilizer quantity in crop fertilization programs.

AB Sediments dredged by an industrial port, slightly contaminated by heavy metals and petroleoum hydrocarbons, were phytoremediated and used as peat-free growing media for the red robin photinia (Photinia x fraseri L). Plants were grown on sediment only (S), sediment mixed with composted pruning residues (S + PR), sediment fertilized with controlled release fertilizers (S + F) and peat-based growing media as control (C). Plant elongation and dry weight, leaf contents of chlorophyll, malondialdehyde (MDA), macronutrients and heavy metals were determined at the end of one growing season. Environmental impact related to the use of sediment-based as compared to peat-based growing media was assessed by the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). Sediment-based growing media presented significantly higher bulk density, pH and electrical conductivity values, lower C and N contents, and significantly higher total and available P. Red robin photinia grown on S + F growing media showed morphological and chemical parameters similar to those of control plants (C), whereas plants grown on S and S + PR showed lower growth. Leaf concentration of nutrients and heavy metals varied depending on the considered element and growing media, but were all within the common values for ornamental plants, whereas the highest MDA concentrations were found in plants grown on traditional growing media. The LCA indicated the use of sediments as growing media reduced the C footprint of ornamental plant production and the contribute of growing media to the environmental impact per produced plant We concluded that sediments phytoremediation and use in plant nursery is a practical alternative re-use option for dredged sediments.

AB Northern peatlands can emit large amounts of carbon and harmful smoke pollution during a wildfire. Of particular concern are drained and mined peatlands, where management practices destabilize an array of ecohydrological feedbacks, moss traits and peat properties that moderate water and carbon losses in natural peatlands. Our results demonstrate that drained and mined peatlands in Canada and northern Europe can experience catastrophic deep burns (>200 t C ha(-1) emitted) under current weather conditions. Furthermore, climate change will cause greater water losses in these peatlands and subject even deeper peat layers to wildfire combustion. However, the rewetting of drained peatlands and the restoration of mined peatlands can effectively lower the risk of these deep burns, especially if a new peat moss layer successfully establishes and raises peat moisture content. We argue that restoration efforts are a necessary measure to mitigate the risk of carbon loss in managed peatlands under climate change.

AB Samanea saman(Jacq.) Merr is a tree species widely used in forest restoration plantations and its symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can promote seedling formation and establishment and growth in the field. The growth ofS. samanseedlings inoculated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi grown on nine different substrates were evaluated in a greenhouse in this study. Seedling growth was promoted in substrates with lower bulk density and pH and higher total porosity, air-filled porosity and available Mg content. The nodulation of NFB was favored in the substrates with more available Mg, and AMF colonization and sporulation was favored in the substrates with a higher percentage of water buffering capacity. Seedlings produced on commercial substrates based on peat and pine bark showed superior growth. The peat-based "Carolina Soil (TM) electrical conductivity (EC) 0.7" favored nodulation, while the sewage sludge substrates and clayey subsoil mixture plus 10% poultry litter (V:V) promoted mycorrhizal colonization and sporulation.

AB Turf provides an irreplaceable surface for recreational and sport activities in urban landscape. Sand-based rootzone is recommended for turf establishment because of its excellent compaction resistance. It is necessary to improve the water and nutrient retention of sand-based rootzone by soil amendments in maintaining healthy turf. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of rice-husk biochar on sand-based rootzone amendment and creeping bentgrass (Agrostsis stolonifera) establishment. The results showed that bulk density was linearly decreased in proportion to rice-husk biochar. Total porosity and capillary porosity, water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were significantly increased in proportion to rice-husk biochar. Sand-based rootzone amended with 10% of rice-husk biochar promoted the seed germination and young seedling growth with the significantly higher growth rate, leaf emergence rate, shoot and root biomass, and turf coverage than the control. These results indicate that rice-husk biochar had superior characteristics to previous reported biochars in the sand-based rootzone amendment and could be used to improve soil physical properties and turf healthy in sports and recreation playgrounds.

AB Deep ripping is a common management technique used to shatter dense subsurface soil horizons that limit percolation of water and penetration of roots. Most studies have concentrated on the effects of deep ripping on subsoils, with few examining the effects on surface soil horizons. A study was conducted on reclaimed fields (undisturbed soil Albic Luvisol) at the Highvale coal mine approximately 80 km west of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, with objectives to evaluate the effect of deep ripping, with and without the use of organic matter amendments, on the physical and chemical properties of Ap horizons of reconstructed minesoils. Significant treatment effects were identified for particle size distribution (alt fractions), plasticity index and the October mean penetration resistance (PR), but effects on bulk density, soil water content at the time of sampling, water retention characteristics and modulus of rupture were non-significant. Soil chemical properties significantly affected included pH, soluble Ca and Mg, exchangeable Na and K, exchangeable Ca:Na ratio and loss of ignition. Addition of subsoil to the Ap horizon as a result of deep ripping likely caused the changes. They are expected to make the seedbed more difficult to cultivate and manage unless specific management practices such as organic matter additions are adopted to overcome the detrimental changes in soil properties that have occurred.

AB Thermal conductivity (K-T), air permeability (K-a) and relative diffusivity of oxygen (ratio of oxygen diffusion coefficient in the soil to the oxygen diffusion coefficient in free air, D/D-0) were measured from undisturbed mor samples taken from low-fertility (CT) Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sites and medium-fertility (MT) Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) sites. K-T was determined with respect to matric potential (psi), whereas K-a and D/D-0 were determined as a function of air-filled porosity (epsilon (A)). K-T(psi) and D/D-0(epsilon (A)) were slightly greater on the MT sites than on the CT sites, whereas K-a(epsilon (A)) did not differ statistically between the site types studied. K-T(psi) and K-a(epsilon (A)) were similar to those values reported in the literature for other organic soils, but D/D-0(epsilon (A)) was slightly lower. Among the MT sites, the parameters for the K-T(psi), K-a(epsilon (A)) and D/D-0(epsilon (A)) models correlated with the water-retention characteristics. Among the CT sites, the parameters for K-a(epsilon (A)) and D/D-0(epsilon (A)) models correlated with bulk density, layer thickness and distance from the nearest trees.

AB Simulated golf greens were used to test the growth of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L. '007') receiving suboptimal chemical fertilization in sand based substrates amended with 15% peat (control), a commercial biochar, a commercial biochar-compost mixture (CarbonizPN-Soil), or seven formulated biochar-compost mixtures. Physical and chemical properties including pH, bulk density, pore space, compaction distance, nutrient content and water/nutrient retention capacity varied among the mixtures. The heights, root lengths, and fresh and dry weights of creeping bentgrass plants grown in polyvinyl chloride tubes containing the different substrate mixtures mimicking a United States Golf Association root zone were evaluated and compared. Forty days after seeding, plants grown in 5% biochar and 10% Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago biosolids had significantly greater fresh weights, dry weights, and shoot heights than the control. Dry weights and shoot heights were also higher than the control in bentgrass grown in the 15% CarbonizPN-Soil mixture. Based on these results the addition of these two biochar-organic amendment mixtures would improve overall plant growth in sand-based root zones under reduced chemical fertilization.

AB This paper presents a geotechnical characterization of deltaic soft soil deposits in the Vistula Marshlands, northern Poland. It shows the limited applicability of organic soil classifications based on Cone Penetration Tests (CPTU) and Dilatometer Tests (DMT). None of the in-situ-based classifications correctly identifies peat. Analysis of the behaviour of contractive/dilative soil layers according to Robertson's updated classification (2016) is shown to be in agreement with volumetric changes observed during triaxial compression tests. The coefficient of primary compression C-c is found to decrease exponentially with the initial bulk density (rho(d0)) and to increase linearly with the in-situ water content (w(c)). The presented geotechnical characterization and reference data can be used for foundation design and soil improvement in the soft organic soils of northern Poland.

AB A top coat is a lightweight substrate component used in seed germination. The seeds are typically placed on a substrate such as peat and then the seeds are covered with a layer of the top coating substrate. The top coat serves to maintain adequate moisture around the seeds and to exclude light. Vermiculite and cork granulates (1 mm) were used as top coat substrates for seed germination to determine if cork granulates could be successfully used as an alternative to vermiculite. The cork granulates had a bulk density of 0.16 g.cm(-3), which was higher than that of vermiculite that had a bulk density of 0.12 g.cm(-3). Cork granulates had an air-filled pore space of 22.7% (v/v), which was higher than vermiculite which was 13.2%. The water-holding capacity of vermiculite was 63.4% (v/v), which was higher than that of cork granulates that was 35.1%. Seeds of 'Rutgers Select' tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), 'Dazzler Lilac Splash' impatiens (Impatiens walleriana), 'Orbital Cardinal Red' geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum), 'Better Belle' pepper (Capsicum annuum), and 'Cooler Grape' vinca (Catharanthus roseus) were placed on top of peat and covered with a 4-mm top coating of either vermiculite or cork granulates. For tomato, impatiens, and vinca, days to germination were similar between seeds germinated using vermiculite and granulated cork as a top coat. Days to germination of geranium and pepper were significantly different with geranium and pepper seeds coated with cork granulates germinating 0.7 and 1.5 days earlier than those coated with vermiculite. For tomato, impatiens, and geranium, the number of seeds germinating per plug tray was similar between the top coats. Number of seeds germinating per tray for pepper and vinca were significantly different. Pepper had an average of 2.8 more seeds germinating per tray, and vinca had an average of 2.4 more seeds germinating per tray if seeds were germinated using granulated cork vs. vermiculite. For all species, dry shoot and dry root weights were similar for seedlings germinated using cork and vermiculite top coats.

AB Substrates with vermicompost added promote growth in horticultural crops. Therefore, it is important to know its properties in order to apply proper amounts of it. This work aims to analyze substrate changes according to vermicompost doses and evaluate the effect of the mixtures on lettuce seedling quality. The essay was carried out under greenhouse conditions in Lujan, Argentina (34 degrees 36'S, 59 degrees 04'W). Butterhead lettuce cv. Tizona was sown using substrates with different amounts of vermicompost added and a commercial mix of peat and perlite: 1) 0% vermicompost, 2) 20% vermicompost, 3) 40% vermicompost. The substrates were analyzed physically and chemically. The number of leaves and both fresh and dry weights of leaves, roots and plant were determined. The treatments were established in a complete randomized block design with four replications. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance, while the difference between means was studied by Tukey's Test. Regression analysis was used to study the response of substrate physical and chemical parameters to the addition of vermicompost, ranging from 0 to 40%. The addition of vermicompost resulted in a linear increased in pH, electrical conductivity, nutrient level, bulk density and total porosity of the substrate, while organic matter decreased linearly and quadratically the percentage of pores occupied by water. The plants responded to the addition of vermicompost, with a 20% increase in size.

AB As a contribution to improving understanding of the mechanisms and relationships that exist within shallow peatland ecosystems, we report the results of monitoring five-years' recovery after restoration of a forestry-drained sloping rich fen site in the Central Sudetes in south-west Poland. Over the last 100 years, drainage ditches installed for forestry management purposes have affected the hydrology, soil and vegetation of this site. Spruce stands were present until 2010, when restoration started with blocking of ditches and clearcutting/removal of trees. The main objective of our study was to determine the effects of these restoration activities on aspects of hydrology and soil condition. We hypothesised that the five years following restoration could provide sufficient time to improve: 1) water table level and water quality, and 2) the physical and chemical properties of the organic soil. Restoration had a positive effect on water table level as early as two years after implementation of drain blocking and reduction of tree cover. However, five years was not sufficient time to reverse the decline in water quality. The concentrations of labile carbon forms in water, as well as water colour (Abs(400)), were similar in 2010 and 2015. Due to peatland rewetting and peat swelling a decrease in peat bulk density was observed. However, this outcome was identified only in the bottom organic soil horizons. This, in turn, affected the thickness of the peat layer and the altitude of the soil surface. Five years of recovery is insufficient to stop the mineralisation of organic matter, as indicated by lower TOC/TN values, slightly higher concentrations of labile forms of carbon, and the W-1 index of secondary transformation.

DE milled peat; time domain reflectrometry
ID REFLECTOMETRY; TDR
AB Time domain reflectrometry (TDR) has been used by soil scientists for many years to measure the volumetric water content of soils. The basic theory relating the dielectric number of a porous matrix containing solids, air and water to the volumetric water content has been developed over time. Empirical calibrations have been proposed for mineral and organic soils. Calibration of TDR for use in milled peat is influenced by the very low densities of organic material encountered and the wide range of bulk density and water content possible. A calibration procedure was followed that varied peat type, water content and packing density. Results indicate that a simple linear calibration curve adequately described the relationship between TDR output and water content calculated by oven drying (R-2 0.90), however this was significantly improved by also accounting for density. A site specific peat-type / packing-density calibration was the most reliable method. The system used could also be calibrated for gravimetric water content, but less reliably. It is concluded that the simplicity of the system and the near universal calibration makes for a useful non-destructive tool for measuring the volumetric water content of milled peat.

AB Background and aims Boreal peatlands are projected to face numerous stressors in the future, including changes in precipitation and nitrogen cycle perturbations. Nitrogen is currently believed to be the limiting factor to peatlands of western Canada, including to Sphagnum, however new insights suggest the possibility of multiple limiting factors.
   Methods Growth, nitrogen assimilation, and annual retention of Sphagnum angustifolium, a species with a broad niche, were observed across a depth to water table gradient for three years to further understand the partitioning of key limiting factors.
   Results Within each year differences of linear growth were responsible for variations in net primary production (NPP), yet yearly differences of NPP were attributed to annual differences in bulk density. Sphagnum angustifolium on the wet end of the depth to water gradient is characterized as nitrogen limited with high growth and low N concentrations, compared to less growth and high N concentrations at the water limiting dry end. Of the nitrogen that is annually assimilated by S. angustifolium, approximately 1.3 g N m(-2) is lost from biomass one year subsequent to assimilation, demonstrating the rapid turnover of this nutrient.
   Conclusion The depth to water table gradient is strongly related to many S. angustifolium growth parameters and is a pivotal mechanism in delineating limiting factors within a single complex peatland ecosystem.

AB Calcareous wetlands are of great interest in conservation biology. Previous research has suggested that there are significant differences in soil microbial N cycle processes between calcareous wetlands developed on organic vs. mineral soils. In the study presented here, we measured potential net N mineralization and nitrification, denitrification enzyme activity and soil inorganic N levels at 25 calcareous wetland sites with variable substrate types. We also evaluated the response of N cycling to livestock grazing by sampling at two sites with heavy grazing activity. All N cycle variables were significantly higher in organic sops than mineral soils on a weight basis; however, there were very few differences when results were expressed on an areal (volume) basis because of the low bulk density of the organic seas. The areal results suggest that organic and mineral soil calcareous wetland sites have similar N water quality maintenance values, that is, the ability to absorb N from upland land areas. Heavily grazed sites had significantly decreased pH and increased NO3- levels relative to undisturbed sites, but the differences were small. The lack of strong differences in N cycle variables between mineral and organic soil sites raises questions about the need to make a classification distinction between calcareous peatlands (fens) and calcareous mineral soil wetlands in nutrient cycling and water quality maintenance contexts.

ID ONE-STEP OUTFLOW; MIXTURES
AB Topsoil blending is a common practice in many metropolitan areas, get few scientific guidelines are available for design of general-use, lawn-area soils. The objective of this study was to provide blending guidelines with focus on establishing a vigorous turfgrass ground cover. A Mahoning silt loam (fine, illitic, mesic Aeric Epiaqualf) and a Tioga loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Dystric Fluventic Eutrochrept) were each blended with a spent foundry sand and a peat humus to form 28 individual soil mixes for each native soil. Soil properties and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) growth were measured for each soil mix. Cation exchange capacity (CEC), bulk density, and plant available water exhibited changes due to soil mix that largely resulted from differences in mix organic matter (OM) content. Compression index, bubbling pressure (H-b), air-filled porosity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) responded to both sand and ORI contents of the soil mixes. The pore distribution parameter, lambda, exhibited a response to sand and OM contents, but only at high levels of either component, principal component analysis (PCA) of soil properties revealed that the first two principal components contained 85 to 88% of the total data variation with correlations between compression index, H-b, air-filled porosity, K-sat, and lambda contained in the first component and correlation between CEC, bulk density, and available water contained in the second component. Regression of turf clipping yield vs. PCA factor scores and regression of factor scores vs. total sand and OM contents suggested that a high-quality, general-use soil for lawn establishment would contain about 65% sand and have an OM content of 8% by weight. The multivariate process of relating turf yield to soil physical properties, as applied in this study, should provide more generalized mix formulation guidelines than do recommendations based on relating turf yield to mix composition.

AB Many studies worldwide have investigated the potential benefits achievable by transforming brown roofs of buildings to green roofs. However, little literature examined the runoff quality/sorption ability of green roofs. As the green roof substrate is the main component to alter the quality of runoff, this investigation raises the possibility of using a mixture of low-cost inorganic materials to develop a green roof substrate. The tested materials include exfoliated vermiculite, expanded perlite, crushed brick and sand along with organic component (coco-peat). Detailed physical and chemical analyses revealed that each of these materials possesses different characteristics and hence a mix of these materials was desirable to develop an optimal green roof substrate. Using factorial design, 18 different substrate mixes were prepared and detailed examination indicated that mix-12 exhibited desirable characteristics of green roof substrate with low bulk density (431 kg/m(3)), high water holding capacity (39.4%), air filled porosity (19.5%), and hydraulic conductivity (4570 mm/h). The substrate mix also provided maximum support to Portulaca grandiflora (380% total biomass increment) over one month of growth. To explore the leaching characteristics and sorption capacity of developed green roof substrate, a down-flow packed column arrangement was employed. High conductivity and total dissolved solids along with light metal ions (Na, K, Ca and Mg) were observed in the leachates during initial stages of column operation; however the concentration of ions ceased during the final stages of operation (600 min). Experiments with metal-spiked deionized water revealed that green roof substrate possess high sorption capacity towards various heavy metal ions (Al, Fe, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and Cd). Thus the developed growth substrate possesses desirable characteristics for green roofs along with high sorption capacity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands represent an important reservoir of carbon, but their functioning can be threatened by water level drawdown caused by climate or land use change. Knowledge of how microbial communities respond to long-term drainage in different peatland types could help improve predictions of the effect of climate change on these ecosystems. We investigated the effect of long-term drainage on microbial community composition in bog, fen and spruce swamp forests (SSF) in the Sumava Mountains (Czech Republic), using high-throughput barcoded sequencing, in relation to peat biochemical properties. Longterm drainage had substantial effects, which depended strongly on peatland type, on peat biochemical properties and microbial community composition. The effect of drainage was most apparent on fen, followed by SSF, and lowest on bog. Long-term drainage led to lower pH, reduced peat decomposability and increased bulk density, which was reflected by reduced microbial activity. Bacterial diversity decreased and Acidobacteria became the dominant phylum on drained sites, reflecting a convergence in bacterial community composition across peatlands after long-term drainage. The archaeal communities changed very strongly and became similar across drained peatlands. Overall, the characteristic differences between distinct peatland types under natural conditions were diminished by long-term drainage. Bog represented a relatively resilient system while fen seemed to be very sensitive to environmental changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drained peatlands are a global concern due to alterations of the water and carbon cycle, loss of habitat, and increased fire frequency. However, methods for restoring drained sloping peatlands are limited and poorly tested. Therefore, we measured water table dynamics, CO2 fluxes, and soil properties at four sloping fens that were restored (1-20years post-restoration) with the installation of small check dams in ditches that had drained the sites for a century. Restoration had a positive effect on water tables, increasing from approximately 45cm below the surface to approximately 15cm below the surface during the summers. Restoration also benefited CO2 fluxes, as the mean net ecosystem exchange was greatest in the restored areas (-2.19gCO(2)m(-2)hour(-1)) compared to the unrestored drained areas (-1.28gCO(2)m(-2)hour(-1)), while in reference areas it was -1.74gCO(2)m(-2)hour(-1). Drainage also caused significant changes to the peat soil including: 25% reduction in soil organic matter (lost between 1.4 to 3.6kg/m(2)), increased bulk density, decreased porosity, and reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity. Restoration did not affect these parameters, even 20years after restoration. This study suggests that although natural water table levels have been reestablished and the process of carbon sequestration improved, the physical properties of the most disturbed, near surface peat soils do not mimic reference conditions 20years post-restoration.

AB This research evaluated green waste compost (GWC) and green waste vermicompost (GWV) as peat substitutes in growing media used for the production of geranium (Pelargonium zonale L) and calendula (Calendula officinalis L.). Five growing media were prepared: 100% Peat (P), 50% Peat + 50% GWC (PC), 100% GWC (C), 50% Peat + 50% GWV (PV), and 100% GWV (V). Geranium and calendula seedlings were transplanted into each medium and were grown under commercial nursery conditions for 6 months, i.e., until they attained commercial size. The higher percentage of GWC and GWV in the growing medium could increase bulk density and air space; decrease total pore space and water-filled porosity; and increase pH, electrical conductivity, and macro- and microelement contents. The heavy metal contents of all growing media were within safe ranges. Particle-size distribution and fertility were superior in the vermicompost-based media than in the compost-based media. Geranium growth was reduced in media containing GWC (C and PC). Calendula growth in compost-based growing media was similar to or greater than growth in pure peat. Geranium and calendula growth and flowering were superior in all vermicompost-based media (PV and V) than in the control medium (P). These results indicate that GWV is better than GVC as a partial substitute for peat in the cultivation of geranium and calendula.

AB The fungal and bacterial activity was determined in 20 northern European peatlands ranging from ombrotrophic bogs to eutrophic fens with key differences in degree of humification, pH, dry bulk density, carbon (C) content and vegetation communities using the selective inhibition (SI) technique. These peatlands were partly disturbed and the respective water tables lowered below the surface layer. Basal respiration ranged from 24 to 128 mu g CO2-C g(-1) dry peat d(-1). Bacterial contributions to CO2 production were high in most peatlands and showed the following pattern: eutrophic >> transitional mesotrophic >> ombrotrophic peatland types. The fungal-to-bacterial (F:B) ratios varied substantially within peatland type, and this was mainly attributed to differences in peat botanical compositions and chemistry. The computed mean Inhibitor Additivity Ratio (IAR) was quite close to 1 to suggest that the SI techniques can be used to partition eukaryotic and prokaryotic activity in wide range of peatlands. Overall, basal respiration, microbial biomass-C, fungal and bacterial activities varied across the studied peatland types, and such differences could have consequences for C- and nutrient-cycling as well as how bogs and fens will respond to environmental changes.

AB Analyses of a core from the deepest known moss peat bank in Antarctica, on Elephant Island, South Shetlands, show that this Chorisodontium aciphyllum-dominated bank began to grow ca. 5500 C-14 yr BP. Combined with other studies in the region the present study indicates more extensive glaciation before 5000 to 6000 BP than today on some of the South Shetland Islands. The main hypothesis is that these frozen moss banks contain important paleoclimatic information. The stratigraphic parameters analyzed included degree of humification, organic and mineral matter content, bulk density, chronology, volumetric growth and organic accumulation rates, carbon and nitrogen concentrations, C/N ratios, nitrogen accumulation rates, and finally magnetic analyses to detect tephra horizons. A discussion of the interrelationships between these parameters is followed by theoretical calculations of annual net primary productivity combined with multivariate analysis of the data set. Results of the analysis show that three calculated productivity peaks coincide with three periods of milder and more humid summers, at 4150-3900, 3180-3030, and 2030-1840 BP. However, the period with possibly the warmest summers, 3180-3030 BP, is interpreted also to have been characterized by cold winters. The data suggest that the periods with the coldest summers (and possibly also winters) prevailed at the earliest stage of the moss bank development, at ca. 3500 BP, and 2500 BP.

AB Poyang Lake is an important wetland with global ecological functions. Impact of plant species composition on soil physicochemical characteristics is potentially critical but is as yet poorly understood in this great, shallow and water passing lake wetland. Five dominant plant communities, Phragmites communis community (Phragmites), Polygonum hydropiper community (P. hydropiper), Artemisia selengensis community (A. selengensis), Carex cinerascens community (C. cinerascens) and Phalaris ayuyldinacea community (Phalaris) were surveyed to identify the influences of plant species composition on soil properties. Results show great heterogeneity in soil characters among studied vegetation communities. The lowest average values of pH and soil bulk density are presented in soil with Phragmites, while the highest ones are determined in C. cinerascens and A. selengensis, respectively. Moreover, C. cinerascens is determined with the highest average contents of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN), whereas Phalaris community presents the lowest soil carbon and nutrient accumulation in surface soil. Plots of C. cinerascens, Phragmites and Phalaris are identified with obvious convergence patterns, while dispersive patterns are identified in A. selengensis and P. hydropiper, suggesting great heterogeneity in soil properties among typical communities in Poyang Lake.

AB A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the growth and development of poinsettia 'Prestige Red' (Euphorbia pulcherrima) grown in a commercial peat-based potting mix (Sunshine Mix #1) amended with biochar at 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, or 100% (by volume) at four different fertigation regimes: F1: 100 to 200 mg.L-1 nitrogen (N), F2: 200 to 300 mg.L-1 N (control), F3: 300 to 400 mg.L-1 N, or F4: 400 to 500 mg.L-1 N. The experiment was a two-factor factorial design with 10 replications for each combination of biochar by fertigation. As the percentage of biochar increased, root substrate pore space and bulk density increased, while container capacity decreased. Root rot and red bract necrosis only occurred in F4 combined with 100% biochar. Plants grown in 40% biochar had a similar growth and development to those in 0% biochar. Up to 80% biochar, plants exhibited no significant change, except in terms of dry weight, which decreased at higher biochar percentages (60% and 80%). In summary, at a fertigation rate of 100 mg.L-1 N to 400 mg.L-1 N, up to 80% biochar could be used as an amendment to peat-based root substrate with acceptable growth reduction and no changes in quality.

AB Permafrost dynamics play an important role in high-latitude peatland carbon balance and are key to understanding the future response of soil carbon stocks. Permafrost aggradation can control the magnitude of the carbon feedback in peatlands through effects on peat properties. We compiled peatland plant macrofossil records for the northern permafrost zone (515 cores from 280 sites) and classified samples by vegetation type and environmental class (fen, bog, tundra and boreal permafrost, and thawed permafrost). We examined differences in peat properties (bulk density, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and organic matter content, and C/N ratio) and C accumulation rates among vegetation types and environmental classes. Consequences of permafrost aggradation differed between boreal and tundra biomes, including differences in vegetation composition, C/N ratios, and N content. The vegetation composition of tundra permafrost peatlands was similar to permafrost-free fens, while boreal permafrost peatlands more closely resembled permafrost-free bogs. Nitrogen content in boreal permafrost and thawed permafrost peatlands was significantly lower than in permafrost-free bogs despite similar vegetation types (0.9% versus 1.5% N). Median long-term C accumulation rates were higher in fens (23g C m(-2)yr(-1)) than in permafrost-free bogs (18g C m(-2)yr(-1)) and were lowest in boreal permafrost peatlands (14g C m(-2)yr(-1)). The plant macrofossil record demonstrated transitions from fens to bogs to permafrost peatlands, bogs to fens, permafrost aggradation within fens, and permafrost thaw and reaggradation. Using data synthesis, we have identified predominant peatland successional pathways, changes in vegetation type, peat properties, and C accumulation rates associated with permafrost aggradation.

AB Freshwater marshes are prevalent in North America, yet their soil carbon stocks remain poorly quantified. To better understand these stocks, and rates of carbon accumulation over short and long timescales, we synthesize available data on soil properties and rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes in the temperate region of North America. Our findings suggest that freshwater marshes are not defined consistently, and that wetland classification schemes may undervalue presumed carbon stocks in freshwater marsh soils. Rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes are often measured over recent time scales (last 50-100 years); these short-term rates are on average (+/- SD) 155 +/- 74 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in temperate North America. Long-term rates of carbon accumulation (measured over centuries and millennia) are on average 51 +/- 38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) yet infrequently measured. Our synthesis of rates of carbon accumulation and vertical accretion, bulk densities, and organic carbon contents suggests that freshwater marshes are accumulating carbon at comparable rates to salt marshes over short timescales and temperate peatlands over longer timescales. These timescales need to be clearly defined in order to improve estimates of the capacity for freshwater marshes to be net carbon sinks presently and in the future.

AB Three composts, derived from municipal solid waste with biosolids, yard trimmings, and yard trimmings with biosolids, were mixed by volume with sphagnum peat and pine bark to formulate 12 substrates. After characterizing physical and chemical properties, the substrates, along with a control, were used for rooting single eye cuttings of pothos (Epipremnum aureum) and terminal cuttings of maranta (Maranta leuconeura) and schefflera (Schefflera arboricola) in enclosed polyethylene tents. All cuttings initiated roots with no significant difference in root numbers per cutting 14 days after sticking, but root lengths 21 days and root-ball coverage ratings 45 days after sticking were significantly affected by substrates. Five of 12 compost-formulated substrates resulted in root lengths of cuttings equal to or longer than the control. In addition to desirable physical properties such as bulk density, total porosity, and air space, common chemical characteristics of the five substrates included low concentration of mineral elements, initial electrical conductivity less than or equal to 3.0 dS.m(-1) based on the pour through extraction method, and pH between 3.8 to 5.0. The five substrates were formulated by combining composted municipal solid waste with biosolids or yard trimmings with biosolids volumetrically at 20% or less or composted yard trimmings at 50% or less with equal volumes of sphagnum peat and pine bark.

AB Morphological structures of peatland mosses control moss water relations and the rate of water loss by drainage and evaporation, thus influencing their physiological functions. While many of these mechanisms are understood for Sphagnum mosses, there is a limited understanding of how these processes operate in Tomenthypnum nitens, a dominant brown moss species in northern rich fens. This study contrasts how different hydrophysical characteristics of Tomenthypnum and Sphagnum species affect capillary water flow that supports evaporation and productivity. Laboratory investigations indicate that volumetric water content (theta), gross ecosystem productivity, and evaporation decreased with water table depth for both mosses, with Sphagnum capitula retaining 10-20% more water (theta range of 0.18-0.32 cm(3) cm(-3)) than Tomenthypnum (0.07-0.16 cm(3) cm(-3)). Despite lower theta and a smaller fraction of pores between 66 and 661 mu m to retain water within the Tomenthypnum structure (10%) compared with Sphagnum (27%), both mosses had similar fractions of water conducting pore spaces and were able to maintain capillary rise throughout the experiment. While there was a larger difference in the bulk density and porosity of the Tomenthypnum moss compared with its underlying peat than there was in the Sphagnum profile, a layer of partially decomposed moss of intermediate properties was sufficient to provide a connection between the moss and peat under low water table conditions. In trying to characterize the soil-water pressure (psi) in near-surface mosses of Tomenthypnum based on measurements of vapour pressure, we found disequilibrium conditions that severely underestimated psi (i.e., very large negative pressures). It is this disequilibrium that drives evaporation and draws up capillary water to the moss surface for peatland-atmosphere carbon and water transfers.

AB This experiment was conducted to investigate physical and chemical characteristics by volume fractions of root media using peatmoss, perlite, and vermiculite, along with effects on the growth of pot chrysanthemums (Dendranthema x grandiflorum 'Vemini') in a C-channel mat irrigation system. To evaluate the physico-chemical properties of 20 root media, the bulk density, particle density, total pore space, pore space, ash content, organic matter, pH, and electrical conductivity were measured and data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA scores revealed that physico-chemical properties changed by the blending of peatmoss, perlite, and vermiculite. The 20 root media were divided into three main groups by hierarchical cluster analysis. At the end of the experiment, the pH and EC of the root media were measured from media divided into four layers. The pH of root media without plants showed a strong linear relationship and the pH of root media with plants increased exponentially. The change of EC in the root medium was indicated as a hyperbolic curve. Plant growth characteristics according to growth in the 20 root media were analyzed by PCA. It was found that the mixing ratios of the root media affected plant growth characteristics. Therefore, mixing ratio is an important factor for pot-plant production in a subirrigation system.

AB The density and diversity of spiders were compared in three periods: I - 1955, if - 1978-1983, III-1996-1998. The quadrat method was applied to estimate the density of spiders, and the Shannon-Wiener index was used to calculate species diversity. A decrease in spider species diversity, through time, was detected in managed grasslands. It was accompanied by a decrease in the number of families. This tendency was not found in natural fens. Spider density was similar in the compared periods. In period Ill, spider diversity and total density were positively correlated wit soil moisture, abundance of microhabitats in an area and landscape heterogeneity measured by the distance to shrubs. A negative correlation was found between the density of spiders and the intensity of management practice (mowing by heavy machines and grazing by cattle), and the bulk density of the soil. Plant diversity (H-4 based on the proportion of the area covered by each plant species) did not influence the diversity of spiders. The proportion of species connected exclusively with the field layer decreased with time. The effect of management on spider mobility was positive.

AB Water table depth in peatlands is strongly linked to physical properties of the peat, such as density (rho(dry)), peat composition and humification, hydraulic conductivity (K), and specific yield (S-y). Dry bulk density and peat depth are commonly used as indicators of K in ecohydrological models. However, no mathematical relationship exists to quantify S-y based on K and rho(dry). As a result, ecohydrological models cannot explicitly reproduce the strong buffering capacity of peatlands. The objectives of this study were to analyse the literature-reported mathematical link between all the physical properties to develop new mathematical relationships between these parameters and to evaluate whether variations in the physical properties of the peat control water table depth in peatlands. Seven peatlands located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands (Quebec, Canada) were sampled, and 1 m long peat cores were collected from up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient zones. All cores were used to measure rho(dry), K, S-y, and to estimate peat composition and humification. Statistically significant correlations were found between (a) K and S-y (log-log model), (b) K and depth (log-log model), (c) S-y and depth (log-log model), (d) rho(dry) and S-y (log model), and (e) rho(dry) and K (log model). No significant difference was found in either K or S-y between sites. However, significant differences were found in water table depths. Because they provide a fuller description of the peat properties that control water table depths, these newly developed functions have the potential to improve the capacity of ecohydrological models to simulate time-varying hydrological conditions.

Pollen assemblages indicate that regional vegetation in the warm, relatively dry early Holocene was mixed coniferous forest with scattered Pseudotsuga menziesii. Herbaceous peat with a C:N of similar to 28, combined with Nuphar microfossils and relatively high %N, suggests the presence of a herb-dominated peatland with standing water and/or bog pools. Carbon and nitrogen accumulation were at their highest during this early Holocene period at mean rates of 30.6 and 1.2g/m(2)/cal. yr, respectively. By 8000cal. yr BP and under a cooler, wetter climate, northern Vancouver Island supported Tsuga heterophylla rainforest similar to today. Decreasing relative water table, inferred from testate amoebae and fungal remains, facilitated the establishment of a Sphagnum bog by 8000cal. yr BP with abundant ericaceous shrubs after 5000cal. yr BP. Temporal variation in carbon accumulation rates corresponds with changes in plant functional types and hydrological conditions: rates were lowest in the early to mid-Holocene during accumulation of Sphagnum peat (7.1g/m(2)/cal. yr) and increased in late Holocene ligneous peat (12.4g/m(2)/cal. yr). Our multi-proxy approach not only demonstrates the overarching control of climate on bog development and carbon and nitrogen accumulation, with seasonality likely playing a major role, but also highlights the strong influence of autogenic processes at a local scale.

AB Paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental studies in the north-eastern Italian Alps have been hampered by the rarity of well-preserved high-altitude deposits and the lack of high-resolution multi-proxy records with adequate chronological control. This paper presents the first complete Late Glacial to Holocene peat succession from the Dolomites (Danta di Cadore, Belluno, Italian Alps). A 7 m core was used to evaluate the potential of the ombrotrophic Val di Ciampo peat deposit (1400 m a.s.l.) as an archive of environmental and climate change. The depth age scale is based upon independent C-14 and Pb-210 dates and combined with peat stratigraphy demonstrates that the peat core covers more than 13,200 cal BP, extending to the end of the last part of the Late Glacial. Bulk density, inorganic matter content, pore water pH, conductivity, Ca/Mg ratios, and Ca, Sr and Ti trends were used to identify changes in trophic conditions through the bog. The boundary between ombrotrophic and minerotrophic conditions occurs at approximately 400 cm below the surface and demonstrates that this core is the longest Eastern Alpine ombrotrophic record yet obtained, corresponding to 7000 cal BP. The high-resolution chemical data of this peat archive improves our understanding of European Alpine Holocene climate variability and the relationship between natural climate fluctuations and anthropogenic climate change during the present interglacial in the Dolomites.

AB We present data on the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen into an open oceanic ombrotrophic bog, SW Sweden, with high levels of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. The aim was to investigate if this peatland currently acts as a sink for atmospheric carbon. Peat cores were sampled from the top peat layer in five different vegetation types. Small pines were used to date the cores. The cores bulk density and carbon and nitrogen content were determined. A vegetation-classified satellite image was used to estimate the areal extent of the vegetation types and to scale up these results to bog level. The rate of current carbon input into the upper oxic acrotelm was 290 g m(-2) yr(-1), and there were no significant differences in accumulation rates among the vegetation types. This organic matter input to the acrotelm was almost completely decomposed before it was deposited for storage in the deeper peat layers (the catotelm) and only a small fraction (< 1%) or 0.012 g m(-2) yr(-1) of the carbon would be left, assuming a residence time of 100 years in the acrotelm. Nitrogen accumulation rates differed between the vegetation classes, and the average input via primary production varied from 5.33 to 16.8 g m(-2) yr(-1). Current nitrogen input rates into the catotelm are much lower, 0-0.059 g m(-2) yr(-1), with the highest accumulation rates in lawn-dominated communities. We suggest that one of the main causes of the low carbon input rates is the high level of nitrogen deposition, which enhances decomposition and changes the vegetation from peat-forming Sphagnum-dominance to dominance by dwarf shrubs and graminoids.

AB Reliable and affordable moisture sensors with a simplified calibration process for obtaining the water content information of soil/soilless substrates were limited. In this paper, an unilateral sensitive capacitive soil moisture sensor, based on the improved ECH2O sensor probe structure, was presented. Through simulating the relationship between the ratio of plate space and plate width (a/b) and probe sensitivity, sensitive depth, respectively, the size of the sensor was determined with ANSYS first. Capacitance measurement circuit based on resonant principle was then designed. The relationship between the output of the sensor and the soil water content calibration model (beta parameter model), was investigated. As a result, we proposed a two-step calibration beta method. Experimental results showed that beta parameter model appropriately described the relationship between the output and the soil water content, the minimum correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.9554 in the soil, peat, perlite, and vinegar residue. The measurement error of beta parameter model was <0.025 units except in perlite. The error caused by the change of bulk density was <0.025 units in peat and vinegar residue. Therefore, the two-step calibration beta method is suitable for calibrating the sensor.

AB We describe an ombrotrophic bog profile from Tinovul Mohos, Eastern Carpathians, Romania to quantitatively reconstruct the hydroclimate and the palaeoecological evolution over the past 1000 years. Findings are based on high-resolution analyses of testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, pollen, micro- and macrocharcoal, delta C-13 stable carbon isotopes, organic matter content and bulk density, supported by AMS radiocarbon dating. We identify five major hydroclimatic intervals. Between AD 1050 and 1300, a wet period occurred associated with a time of reduced human population. Between AD 1300 and 1600, wet conditions continued to prevail, but with tendency towards drier mire settings. The third period from AD 1600-1680 revealed two abrupt disturbances in the local hydrology (strong dry-wet shifts). The fourth period, from AD 1680-1950, showed intermediate moist conditions with an increased humidity. After AD 1950, mire conditions became dry and there was an intensification in disturbances activity (forest clearance, fire and peatland drainage). Our multi-proxy reconstruction represents one of the few studies of the hydroclimate and palaeoecological evolution of the last millennium in the central-eastern Europe. Findings show good agreement with other hydroclimate reconstructions from this region, but not with records from north-western Europe. More high-resolution multi-proxy studies are needed to improve our understanding of the feedback mechanisms in peatlands and the factors behind these changes.

ID PEATLANDS
AB Natural mires generally act as sinks for CO2 and are sources of CH4 for the atmosphere. However, drainage may transform these ecosystems into net sources of CO2, but the increase in growth of the tree stand and consequent fixation of carbon after drainage may be expected to have a compensating effect. The post-drainage change in the peat carbon stores was determined using a method based on the bulk density and carbon content profiles measured along a transect running from the undrained part to the drained part of the mire. The difference between the undrained and drained peat carbon stores, averaged over the 30 yr period after drainage, indicated that the accumulation of carbon had been 35 g C m(-2) yr(-1) greater in the undrained site. As the long-term accumulation rate of the undrained site had been 21 g C m(-2) yr(-1), the drained part had lost 14 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from the pre-drainage carbon store. Total accumulated biomass in the tree stand was estimated from stem wood development using the growth and yield tables for this site type. The stem wood volumes were transformed into total biomass values using published stem-volume/total-biomass ratios. If no harvesting operations were to occur during the first 300 yrs, the tree stand would produce an average carbon store of approximately 11 kg C m(-2). The application of a standard thinning regime would reduce this storage by ca 50%. Expressed as an average over 300 yrs, drainage increased the total carbon store of the mire if no tree harvesting was done and the store remained unchanged if standard harvesting procedures were used.

AB Wildfire is the largest disturbance affecting peatland ecosystems and can typically result in the combustion of 2-3kgCm(-2) of near-surface peat. We hypothesized that organic soil burn severity, as well as the associated carbon emissions, varies significantly as a function of hydrogeological setting due to groundwater impacts on peat bulk density and moisture content. We measured depth of burn (DOB) in three peatlands located along a hydrogeological and topographic gradient in Alberta's Boreal Plains. Peatland margins across all hydrogeological settings burned significantly deeper (0.245 +/- 0.018m) than peatland middles (0.057 +/- 0.002m). Further, hydrogeological setting strongly impacted DOB. A bog with an ephemeral groundwater connection in a coarse-textured glaciofluvial outwash experienced the greatest DOB at its margins (0.514 +/- 0.018m) due to large water table fluctuations, while a low-lying oligotrophic groundwater flow-through bog in a coarse-textured glaciofluvial outwash experienced limited water table fluctuations and had the lowest margin burn severity (0.072 +/- 0.002m). In an expansive peatland in a lacustrine clay plain, DOB at the margins bordering an isolated domed bog portion (0.186 +/- 0.003m, range: 0.0-0.748m) was considerably greater than the DOB observed at fen margins with a longer groundwater flow path (<0.05m). Our research indicates that groundwater connectivity can have a dominant control on soil carbon combustion across and within hydrogeological settings. We suggest that hydrogeological setting be used to identify potential deep burning hotspots' on the landscape to increase the efficacy of wildfire management and mitigation strategies.

AB The physical parameters of four different Elephant grass "Miscanthus ogiformis" 'Giganteus' composts and four of the most used types of peat products in Denmark, along with a wood fiber growing medium (Culti), were compared to determine possible physical differences, and to test whether compost could be used as an alternative substrate to peat. The Miscanthus straw was composted with three different N sources: ammonium sulfate, liquid pig manure and urea plus tap water (as a control). Compared to peats, the composts tested had low total bulk density, high air-filled porosity and a high diffusion coefficient of oxygen. None of the 9 products tested had the optimum levels of all the different physical parameters. Mixing the tested compost and peat will possibly increase the air-filled porosity of the substrates compared to pure peat, and brings the substrates physical parameters closer to the ideal recommended range. These compost media require further investigation before they can be used directly as an alternative to peat in greenhouse production.

AB The annual carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) dynamics were measured with static chambers on two organic agricultural soils with different soil characteristics. Site I had a peat layer of 30 cm, with an organic matter (OM) content of 74% in the top 20 cm. Site 2 had a peat layer of 70 cm but an OM content of only 40% in the top 20 cm. On both sites there were plots under barley and grass and also plots where the vegetation was removed. All soils were net sources of CO2 and N2O, but they consumed atmospheric CH4. Soils under barley had higher net CO2 emissions (830 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)) and N2O emissions (848 mg N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1)) than those under grass (395 g CO2-C m(-3) yr(-1) and 275 mg N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1)). Bare soils had the highest N2O emissions, mean 2350 mg N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1). The mean CH4 uptake rate from vegetated soils was 100 mg CH4-C m(-3) yr(-1) and from bare soils 55 mg CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1). The net CO2 emissions were higher from Site 2, which had a high peat bulk density and a low OM content derived from the addition of mineral soil to the peat during the cultivation history of that site. Despite the differences in soil characteristics, the mean N2O emissions were similar from vegetated peat soils from both sites. However, bare soils from Site 2 with mineral soil addition had N2O emissions of 2-9 times greater than those from Site 1. Site 1 consumed atmospheric CH4 at a higher rate than Site 2 with additional mineral soil. N2O emissions during winter were an important component of the N2O budget even though they varied greatly, ranging from 2 to 99% (mean 26%) of the annual emission. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A peat core from a raised bog in southern Sweden was examined (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk densities, loss on ignition) to investigate the effects of climate change and human impact on the plant species composition and carbon accumulation of the peat forming vegetation. C-14 wiggle-match dating was applied for fine-resolution dating. Cooling at the start of the Little Ice Age was reflected by a decline of thermophilous trees from the pollen record between ca. cal AD 1275 - 1590, coinciding with increases in atmospheric Delta C-14 pointing to decreases of solar activity (Wolf and Sporer minimum). Human impact also decreased. Later, the effect of human impact was clearly visible in the form of a black brown, decomposed peat layer, the top of which marks a gap of more than 300 years. Artificial drainage probably caused secondary decomposition and oxidation of the peat. From ca. cal AD 1960 the water table of the peat bog was restored following construction of a road and raised bog vegetation regenerated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lowering of water tables by ditching in boreal, minerotrophic peatlands modifies soil environmental factors that regulate nitrogen mineralization-immobilization. Long-term responses of nitrogen mineralization to drainage may vary depending on substrate pH and chemical composition. Research has shown that peat drainage and N fertilization of boreal Histosols increase growth rates of coniferous trees. This study was conducted to determine the response of N mineralization to lowering of water tables and to relate N mineralization to selected soil properties. Net N mineralization rates were determined by in situ incubation of peat samples in paired natural and drained areas of midcontinental boreal fens representing a gradient in soil pH from 4.0 to 7.2. Analysis of variance of N mineralization revealed a significant interaction between soil pH and drainage category. At pH 4.0, net N mineralization did not differ between the natural and drained areas. At the intermediate pH levels, net N mineralization in the natural areas was up to two times that of the drained areas. At pH 7.2, the N mineralization relationship between the two areas was reversed. Post-ditching increases in peat bulk density in the sites of intermediate pH correlated with higher volumetric water content and lower concentration of inorganic N compared with the natural areas. The concentration of inorganic N decreased by about 50% with soil depth to 30 cm in both the natural and drained areas. Although small for all soils, net NO3- production was not influenced by the pH level or drainage category from 7 to 30 yr after ditching.

AB A simulation model flow in cutover peat systems (FLOCOPS) was developed to improve the current understanding of the hydrology of cutover peatlands and the water management programs designed to restore them. FLOCOPS considers temporal variability in peat bulk density, shrinkage character and theta-Psi (soil moisture-pressure head) relationships, volume changes due to compression, and changes to saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-S) and saturated volumetric soil moisture (theta(S)). FLOCOPS was evaluated by comparing simulated and observed 1998-1999 trends in elevation change (thickness of peat deposit), water table, theta, and Psi. FLOCOPS effectively represented observed trends in elevation change, theta, and Psi. A sensitivity analysis indicated that FLOCOPS was most sensitive to the retention, storage, and consolidation characteristics of the peat. Volume changes reduced hydrological variability, whereas low water retentivity and high water storage helped maintain high and stable theta, Psi, and water table position. The sensitivity of the peat system's hydrology to changes in pore structure suggests that minimizing changes to the peat's characteristic pore structure during extraction and subsequent abandonment of the peatland will result in significantly more favorable hydrological conditions for bog restoration.

AB We investigated the physical and chemical properties of six spent mushroom composts (SMCs) and addressed the possibility of reusing SMCs as growing media for transplant production by comparing the seed germination and growth characteristics of lettuce transplants grown in the SMC-based media. The tested SMCs were collected from factory-like mushroom production systems that produced major mushrooms, such as Agaricus bisporus, Flammulina velutipes, Pleurotus eryngii, Hipsizigus marmoreus, Grifola frondosa and Pholiota nameko. We used SMCs discharged from factory-like mushroom production systems because of their year-round uniformity in composition. SMC uniformity is critical for plant growing media used in transplant production that requires highly sophisticated control of edaphic environments. The six tested SMCs had a higher nutrient content than the commercial medium and the bunasimezi SMC had the highest bulk density. The pH and EC of the white button mushroom SMC were higher than those of other SMCs. Lettuce transplants grown in the white button mushroom SMC had a high seed germination and early growth, similar to results obtained with commercial medium. The use of bunasimezi SMC resulted in the smallest percentage of germination and retarded early growth.

AB Ornamental tree planting and establishment in cities is a great challenge because urban soil physical properties are unfavourable to the development of root systems. Our objectives were to measure (i) the effects of organic matter on soil physical properties and tree development, and (ii) the effects of ensuing root development on soil physical properties. Using twenty-four 600-L planted or bare soil containers, we monitored physical properties such as dry bulk density, aggregate stability and near-saturated hydraulic conductivity of our reconstituted soils over a 5.5-year period. A 28-cm thick top layer of sandy loam amended with 40% (v/v) sphagnum peat or organic composts was laid on top of a 28-cm thick layer of sandy loam. Bare-root Ostrya carpinifolia trees were planted in half of the 24 containers, and we monitored shoot development and root biomass and distribution. After 5.5 years, trunk diameter had increased from 59 mm for the control soil to 66 mm for soil mixed with green waste compost, and 74 mm for soil mixed with co-compost of sewage sludge and wood chips. After 4.5 years, trunk diameter was strongly correlated with the total number of axes (r = 0.94) and fine root length density (r = 0.98), and was confirmed as a good indicator of tree development. Fine root development increased stable aggregate formation in all treatments as compared to bare soil. After 4.5 years after planting, the tree root system induced by a high organic matter input had significantly improved near-saturated hydraulic conductivity and was fit to support fertile urban soils.

ID CONDUCTIVITY
AB Knowledge of hydraulic functions is required for various hydrological and plant-physiological studies The evaporation method is frequently used for the simultaneous determination of hydraulic functions of unsaturated soil samples, i.e., the water-retention curve and hydraulic-conductivity function All methodic variants of the evaporation method suffer from the limitation that the hydraulic functions can only be determined to a mean tension of approximate to 60 kPa. This is caused by the limited measurement range of the tensiometers of typically 80 kPa on the dry end We present a new, cost- and time-saving approach which overcomes this restriction Using the air-entry pressure of the tensiometer's porous ceramic cup as additional defined tension value allows the quantification of hydraulic functions up to close to the wilting point. The procedure is described, uncertainties are discussed, and measured as well as simulated test results are presented for soil samples of various origins, different textures (sand, loam, silt, clay, and peat) and variable dry bulk density The experimental setup followed the system HYPROP which is a commercial device with vertically aligned tensiometers that is optimized to perform evaporation measurements During the experiment leaked water from the tensiometer interior wets the surrounding soil of the tensiometer cup and can lead to a tension retardation as shown by simulation results This effect is negligible when the tensiometers are embedded vertically. For coarsely textured soils and horizontal tensiometer alignment, however, the retardation must be considered for data evaluation

AB 1 Blanket mire in Northern Ireland is an ecologically threatened habitat in which land use for hand peat-cutting, forestry and agriculture has had a major influence. A recent land use change is the introduction of tractor-powered peat-harvesting. In this paper, the effect of machine peat-cutting on ombrotrophic blanket mire vegetation is assessed from a regional sample of cut and uncut plots.
   2 Principal components analysis identified watertable depth and grazing intensity as major factors influencing the species composition of uncut mire. A key variable affecting the composition of machine-cut mire across the drainage gradient was the number of times cut, with multiple annual cutting causing progressive decreases in acrotelm depth, catotelm bulk density and plant cover. Ericaceous species and Sphagnum spp. were particularly sensitive to cutting, with Eriophorum angustifolium and Campylopus introflexus characteristic of multiple-cut sites.
   3 Redundancy analysis, with number of times cut partialled out, showed that recovery time accounted for a significant amount of variance in vegetation composition. Species that significantly increased in abundance with recovery time were Sphagnum spp., Odontoschisma sphagni, Erica tetralix and Drosera rotundifolia.
   4 Sites cut frequently, or which were grazed, recovered more slowly. Recovery from cutting was partly dependent on the post-cutting structure of the mire surface and the species that survive cutting. The rate of recovery on sites cut once, then abandoned, is relatively rapid compared with multiple-cut sites where species colonization is constrained by bare compacted peat.

AB The objective of this research was to assess the total concentrations and pools of trace elements in the surface layers of organic soils in the Stolowe Mountains (Central Sudetes). Trace element concentrations are discussed in relation to the site variability and soil properties. Moreover, an attempt is made to assess the dominant source of trace elements in the peatlands, by comparison of different types of peatlands (fen - peat bogs). Peat coring and sampling were carried out along five research transects in September 2013. In total, 19 sampling plots were established within 5 shallow peatlands. The following soil properties were determined in the sampled peat material: ash content, bulk density, degree of peat decomposition, soil pH, total organic carbon (TOC) and the total content of Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd. The pools of trace elements were calculated for the 0-30 cm topsoil layer. In the study, no statistically significant correlations were found between an altitude and trace element content, which might be the result of small differences in elevation between the study sites. Additionally, this result might have been caused by differences in the organic matter content and soil pH among the study sites, confirmed by statistical analyses. Trace element concentrations and pools in peat soils are the result of both air deposition and groundwater interflow. Fen peatlands obtain a large load of elements mainly from substrates. The highest air-borne pollutant deposition rates (Pb in particular) were recorded in the 10-20 cm layer of the peat bog soils, what is due to the historical deposition of pollutants from the former "Black Triangle" region.

DT Article
DE Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity; Peat; Moss; Compression
ID WATER-CONTENT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH; PEAT; SOIL
AB Due to the non-vascular nature of Sphagnum mosses, the capitula (growing surface) of the moss must rely solely on capillary action to receive water from beneath. Moss subsides and swells in accordance with water table levels, an effect called "mire-breathing", which has been thought to be a self-preservation mechanism, although no systematic studies have been done to demonstrate exactly how volume change affects hydrophysical properties of moss. In this study, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Kunsat) and water content of two different species of Sphagnum moss were measured at different compression rates, up to the maximum of 77%. The findings show that the Kunsat increases by up to an order of magnitude (10x) with compression up to a certain bulk density of the moss, after which higher levels of compression result in lowered unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. This was coupled with an increase in soil water retention with increased compression. The increase of the Kunsat with compression suggests that the mire-breathing effect should be considered a self-preservation mechanism to provide sufficient amount of water to growing moss in times of low water availability.

AB Background: Peatlands play a key role in the global carbon cycle; these contain one third of the world's soil organic carbon, equivalent to more than half the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, these ecosystems have been scarcely studied in southern South America. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the recent accumulation rates of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in two kinds of oligotrofic peatlands in Isla Grande de Chiloe-Chile.
   Results: Using peat C and N content, dry bulk density, and Pb-210 dating, we determined the rates of N and C accumulation in profiles from five peatlands in the northern Chilean Patagonia. The recent rate of C accumulation (RERCA) ranges from 8.5 to 87.06 g C m(-2) year(-1), and the recent rate of N accumulation (RERNA) ranges from 0.15 to 2.37 g N m(-2) year(-1). The difference in RERCA and RERNA between glacial peatlands and anthropogenic peatlands was significant. One of the remarkable results is that accumulation of N and C are directly related.
   Conclusions: This study contributes for a better understanding of the Patagonian peatlands of Chile. In addition, this research contributes by setting a basis for conducting further studies and for assessing the impacts of climate change on peatlands.

AB Northern peatlands (those located in boreal and subarctic regions) are important components of global soil organic carbon (C) stock. Moreover, they are located in regions witnessing rapid changes in climate and becoming intensely scrutinized for industrial development and alternative energy generation. However, peat C stock is highly variable and little is known about its variability especially among peatland types. This is an issue because it makes the monitoring of peatland carbon stock complicated especially with the changing climatic conditions. Furthermore, it limits the opportunities to successfully estimate peatland C stock across regional scales. We estimated peat C stock using data from 1982 to 1985 from Ontario Geologic Survey field study of peatlands distributed across twelve sites in northern Ontario. Carbon stock (kg C m(-2)) was estimated using the equation: carbon concentration on gravimetric basis x bulk density x peat depth. The peat sampling depth was about 1 m and had a total data point of around 203 points. Treed fens had the highest mean C stock +/- SE of 223 +/- 31 kg C m(-2) while open bogs had the lowest mean C stock +/- SE of 157 +/- 7 kg C m(-2). Mean C stock also varied among peatlands at regional level with the inter-quartile range of about 72-73 kg C m(-2) for open bogs and fens; and around 94-141 kg C m(-2) for treed bogs and fens respectively. Minimum detectable differences in C stock were also large, ranging from 50 to 113 kg C m(-2) for bogs and fens, respectively. The required sample size to detect 20% change in peat C at a power of 70% was more than double (212 plot) for fens than the number of sample plots (82) surveyed. This implies more sample size and information for fens is needed. This could potentially be achieved by the use of geospatial technology in deriving peatland biophysical information.

AB Hydrology, particularly the water table position below the Surface (relative water level, RWL), is an important control oil biogeochemical and ecological processes in peatlands. The surface elevation (SE) in a peatland oscillates ill response to changes in effective stress oil the peat rnatrix Mainly caused by water level fluctuations. This phenomenon is called peatland Surface oscillation (PSO). To investigate the spatiotemporal variability of PSO, Surface elevation and the water level above sea level (AWL) were measured monthly (23 sites) over one year in a warm-temperate restiad peatland, New Zealand. At one site peat surface elevation was measured indirectly by monitoring AWL and RWL continuously with pressure transducers. Annual PSO (the difference between maximum and minimum surface elevation) ranged from 3.2 to 28 cm (mean = 14.9 cm). Surface elevation changes were caused by AWL fluctuations. Spatially homogenous AWL fluctuations (mean 40 cm among sites) translated into RWL fluctuations reduced 27-56% by PSO except for three sites with shallow and dense peat at the peatland margin (7-17%). The SE-AWL relationship was linear for 15 sites. However, eight sites showed significantly higher rates of surface elevation changes during the wet season and thus a non-linear behaviour. We suggest flotation of upper peat layers during the wet season causing, this non-linear behaviour. Surprisingly, PSO was subjected to hysteresis: the positive SE-AWL relationship reversed after rainfall when the Surface slowly rose despite rapidly receding AWL. Hysteresis was more prominent during the dry season than during the wet season. Total peat thickness and bulk density together could only explain 50% of the spatial variability of PSO based oil manual measurements. However. we found three broad types of SE-AWL relationships differing in shape and slope of SE-AWL Curves. These oscillation types reflected patterns in vegetation and flooding.

AB Fresh parboiled rice hulls ground in a hammer mill and screened through a 1.18-mm screen and collected on a 0.18-mm screen (RH3) and particles with a specific diameter of 0.5 to 1.0 mm had total pore space (TPS), air-filled pore space (AFP), and water-holding capacity (WHC) similar to that of Canadian sphagnum peat (peat). However, RH3 had more available water, a higher bulk density (BD), and a higher particle density (PD) than peat. When blended with 20% to 40% perlite or 1 cm aged pine bark, RH3-based substrates had lower TPS, similar AFT, and lower WHC than equivalent peat-based substrates. The RH3-containing substrates had higher BD and average PD than equivalent peat-based substrates. When blended with parboiled rice hulls (PBH), RH3-based substrates had lower TPS than equivalent peat-based substrates. When blended with 20% to 40% PBH, RH3-based substrates had lower AFP than equivalent peat-based substrates. RH3-based substrates containing up to 20% PBH had lower WHC than equivalent peat-based substrates. RH3-based substrates containing 40% PBH had a higher WHC than equivalent peat-based substrates. When blended with PBH, all RH3-based substrates had higher BD and average PD than equivalent peat-based substrates. The addition of 40% RH3 to a peat-based substrate containing 20% perlite decreased substrate TPS, whereas the addition of 10% to 40% decreased AFP. The addition of 10% to 30% RH3 increased WHC. The addition of 30% RH3 to a peat-based substrate containing 20% 1 cm aged pine bark decreased substrate TPS and the addition of 20% to 40% RH3 decreased AFP. The addition of 10% RH3 increased WHC, but the addition of 20% or more RH3 did not affect WHC. The addition of 30% RH3 increased the BD, but the addition of MU had no effect on average PD. The addition of 20% or more and 30% or more RH3 to a peat-based substrate containing 20% PBH decreased substrate TPS and AFP, respectively. The addition 20% RH3 decreased WHC. The addition of 10% to 40% RH3 increased BD. Overall, RH3 was the ground rice hull product that had physical properties most similar to peat. Peat-based substrates in Which up to 40% of the peat was replaced with RH3 had physical properties that, although different from peat controls, were within commonly recommended ranges for substrates used to grow greenhouse crops.

AB This paper presents the results of a study on the geochemistry of Fe in a minerotrophic wetland in Central New York. Fine-scale geochemical trends in the peat and peat porewater were investigated to evaluate detailed vertical profiles of Fe in solution. Two sites within the wetland were examined: one site adjacent to an agricultural field receiving nutrient inputs and another (pristine) site in the middle of the wetland. Results revealed that Fe(II) was produced in situ in the wetland, most probably as a result of microbial Fe(III) reduction. Iron(II) concentration profiles suggested the existence of Fe(III) reduction in the zone adjacent to the agricultural field, whereas no significant evidence for Fe(III) reduction occurred in the pristine zone. Theoretical equilibrium modeling predicted that the difference in soluble Fe concentrations between the two zones was probably caused by abiotic reactions, such as pyrite precipitation. Geochemically, a correlation between Fe(II) and bulk density showed the importance of Fe reduction in the decomposition of organic matter in the organic rich peat and demonstrated the importance of the mineralogical composition for the reduction of Fe(III). Finally, a unique reversal of Fe and SO42- reduction was discovered in the zone adjacent to the agricultural field. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Oceanic mangroves accumulate peat with sea-level rise without terrestrial sediment inputs, but fossil peat's elevation as a tide-range limited sea-level indicator is assumed to be affected by compaction. Despite assumption of decomposition, compression, and dewatering, pure Rhizophora mangle peat appears coarse, water-saturated, and loose even at depth. Calibrated peat densities from computed tomography (CT) and petrologic analysis allow quantitative assessment of compaction in continuous peats from Florida (6 m thick), Belize (12 m thick), and Panama (3.5 m thick). Pure peat exhibits voids at all depths and >80% water contents. CT density does not increase with depth; bulk densities are low, minimally variable, and trend-free. Higher CT-density intervals coincide with compositional changes (sediment, coral). CT of peat buried under sediment shows a shift to higher densities. CT of air-dried continuous peat shows uncompressed fine and coarse roots and voids, with negative densities indicative of air in place of interstitial water. Peat's high water content and hydraulic conductivity prevent dewatering and compaction, hypothetically maintaining original sea-level indicative elevations at intermediate depths. Non-compacted, sediment-free, offshore peats can provide a continuous proxy for reconstructing the record of sea-level rise at any site, if depositional, disturbance, and geochemical and biotic processes affecting C-14 ages are also assessed.

AB Apparent recent carbon and peat accumulation rates over the past 1200 years were measured in five peat landforms in the discontinuous permafrost zone near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, Canada. The White River volcanic ash layer was used as a chronostratigraphic horizon to ensure a consistent time span of peat deposition among peat cores and to allow a large core sample size (n = 20 cores in each landform) without the expense of radiocarbon dating. Apparent recent carbon accumulation rates were not significantly different (p>0.05) among rich fen (13.58 +/- 1.07 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), peat plateau (13.31 +/- 2.20 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and collapse fen (13.54 +/- 1.50 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Poor fen and ombrotrophic bog accumulation rates were 20.34 +/- 2.86 and 21.81 +/- 3.25 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, and were not significantly different from each other. Variation within the poor fen and ombrotrophic bog cores is attributed to microtopography, with hollows accumulating carbon at significantly greater rates than hummocks. Vertical peat accumulation rates vary significantly in the poor fen, with hummocks showing a greater annual vertical accumulation rate than hollows. Vertical peat accumulation rates ranged from 0.282 +/- 0.052 mm yr(-1) in the peat plateau to 0.563 +/- 0.070 mm yr(-1) in the ombrotrophic bog. Variations in mean core bulk density were also significant and ranged from 0.071 +/- 0.011 g cm(-3) (collapse fen) to 0.102 +/- 0.011 g cm(-3) (poor fen). A regional survey incorporating measurements from other parts of the southwestern Northwest Territories and the southeastern Yukon show rates similar to those near Fort Simpson. These rates are significantly lower than published rates from other parts of northern Canada, Finland, and the former Soviet Union. Low and variable summer precipitation in the region may contribute to the low carbon accumulation rates through decreased plant production and/or increased aerobic decomposition.

AB Biochar from conifers wood was used in soilless culture as growing substrate alternative to peat for ornamental crops. Potted plants of Euphorbia x lomi Rauh cv. 'Ilaria' were grown with different mixtures (v:v) of brown peat and biochar in order to evaluate main physical and chemical characteristics of this biomaterial as well as its effect on plant growth, ornamental characteristics and nutrients uptake. Biochar addition to peat increased pH, EC and K content of the growing substrates, as well as air content and bulk density. Biochar content of substrates significantly affected plant growth and biomass partitioning: higher number of shoots and leaves, leaf area and leaf dry weight were recorded in plants grown in 40% peat-60% biochar, with respect to plants grown in 100% peat and secondarily in 100% biochar. Leaf chlorophyll content was higher in plants grown in 60% and 80% biochar, while biomass water use efficiency was higher with 60% biochar. Plant uptake of K and Ca increased as biochar content of the substrates increased. Hence, a growing substrate containing 40% brown peat and 60% conifers wood biochar was identified as the more suitable mixture allowing to have a high-quality production of Euphorbia x lomi potted plants.

AB Shallow water tables protect northern peatlands and their important carbon stocks from aerobic decomposition. Hydraulic conductivity, K, is a key control on water tables. The controls on K, particularly in degraded and restored peatlands, remain a subject of ongoing research. We took 29 shallow (50cm) peat cores from an estuarine raised bog in Wales, UK. Parts of the bog are in close-to-natural condition, while other areas have undergone shallow peat cutting for fuel and drainage, followed by restoration through ditch blocking. In the laboratory we measured horizontal (K-h) and vertical (K-v) hydraulic conductivity. We fitted linear multiple regression models to describe log(10)-transformed K-h and K-v on the basis of simple, easy-to-measure predictors. Dry bulk density and degree of decomposition were the strongest predictors of K-h and K-v. Perhaps surprisingly, the independent effect of hummocks was to produce higher-K-v peat than in lawns; while the independent effect of restored diggings was to produce higher-K peat than in uncut locations. Our models offer high explanatory power for K-h (adjusted r(2)=0.740) and K-v (adjusted r(2)=0.787). Our findings indicate that generalizable predictive models of peat K, similar to pedotransfer functions for mineral soils, may be attainable. K-h and K-v possess subtly different controls that are consistent with the contrasting roles of these two properties in peatland water budgets. Our near-surface samples show no evidence for the low-K marginal peat previously observed in deeper layers at the same site, indicating that such structures may be less important than previously believed.

AB A peat core (10x10x100 cm) was removed from Etang de la Gruere, an ombrotrophic peat bog in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland. The core was sliced into 3 cm sections and the samples characterized with respect to ash content, bulk density, moisture content, and concentrations of C and H. Solid peat residues were freeze-dried, milled very finely and analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Pore waters expressed from the peat slices were collected, filtered (0.2 mum membrane filters) and analyzed using fluorescence emission, excitation and synchronous-scan spectroscopy, in addition to pH. Taken together, the physical properties of the core and the ESR measurements of solid peats appear to record the variation in humification of refractory organic matter (peat). The fluorescence and FT-IR data, on the other hand, appear to characterize the extent of recent decomposition of labile organic matter. In fact, these data indicate the presence of two distinct zones in the bog: (i) the acrotelm, or zone of active decay, which may be oxygenated, depending on the season and the depth to the water table, and (ii) the catotelm which is always anoxic, and where organic matter decomposition rates are negligible.

AB Natural peatlands provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage and habitat, which can be negatively affected (degraded) by the proximity of agricultural land due to lowered water table and increased nutrient deposition. We assessed peat biochemistry and microbial function in the dry, fluctuating and saturated zones of the peat deposits at Moanatuatua (degraded) and Kopuatai (intact) raised bogs in New Zealand to investigate the effects of adjacent agriculture on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Peat C and N density were elevated, due in part to greater bulk density, in the dry and saturated zones at Moanatuatua compared with Kopuatai. Functional capacity (multi-substrate induced respiration) at Moanatuatua was greater than at Kopuatai, and water-soluble C was at lower concentration but more degradable, indicating that microbes were C limited at Moanatuatua but N limited at Kopuatai. Greater microbial function at Moanatuatua infers C inputs may be more rapidly converted to gaseous or waterborne exports, and agriculturally affected peatlands may be more susceptible to losses of labile C. We conclude that proximity to agriculture is likely to have caused changes in chemical properties and altered microbial functioning of restiad bog and has important implications for C and N turnover within these peatland systems.

AB Peatlands dominate the landscape (similar to 50% of total area) in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) in northern Alberta, and as such, are susceptible to hydrological disturbance from oil sands mining and exploration. In this study, we explore the hydrochemical response of a disturbed fen (Firebag Fen) in the AOSR following the removal of a temporary access road that was operational from 2007 to 2013. Prior to road removal flow was impeded at Firebag Fen, evidenced by inundation on the up-gradient side, and a lower water table on the down-gradient side of the road. Reclamation included the road removal of the similar to 0.5 m thick road, including 0.15 m of clay, 0.3 m of mud and organics, and 0.05 m of gravel, which left a surficial depression following removal. Peat samples (n = 139) collected immediately following road removal demonstrated significantly greater bulk densities on the down-gradient side relative to the up-gradient side of the fen, and in the road-removed area relative to up- and down-gradient areas. These combined changes decreased the average hydraulic conductivity of the fen by similar to 79%, which reduced water discharge across the site. Another peat sampling campaign in 2016 (n = 48), three years after removal, showed a significant decrease in bulk density where the road was removed, to within the range of values observed at areas up and down-gradient of the road. These changes increased the average hydraulic conductivity of the entire system by 64%, compared to that which was measured in 2013, with water discharge 9 and 12% higher than in 2013, during characteristically dry and wet periods, respectively. Some changes to the water chemistry (n = 24-28 for each sampling date) of the fen were also detected but patterns were different among parameters measured. For example, median concentrations on the down-gradient side of the road were 1651% (NO3-), 280% (SO42-) and 135% (Cl-) higher relative to the up-gradient side of the road. Over time following road removal, differences were reduced to 100% for nitrate, 192% for sulphate, 108% for chloride, while other parameters remained relatively unchanged (Ca2+, Mg2+, K-). Continued peat rebound (thus increasing hydraulic conductivity) may occur over time; however, elucidating this would require long-term monitoring. It is concluded that despite the impacts that were caused to the site, the natural hydrologic regime of the fen was able to operate following removal. Removal and reclamation should be considered as a worthwhile venture for roads that extend through fens and are no longer in use.

AB The main aim of this paper is to present the pitfalls connected with the construction of reliable chronologies for anthropogenically disturbed peatlands over the last two millennia based on Pb-210 and C-14 dating, i.e. the period of the strongest human impact on these ecosystems. The following hypotheses have been formulated: i) parts of peatlands suspected to be affected by peat extraction may possess traces of mechanical disturbances undetectable using different analyses based on biota proxy; ii) failure to consider information included in radionuclide date inversions may contribute to the establishment of misleading chronologies. To test these hypotheses, different scenarios of chronology based on high resolution Pb-210 and C-14 dating from a peat core retrieved from the Puscizna Krauszowska bog (southern Poland) have been analysed. Nowadays, this mire is intensively exploited by humans; however, it contains remains of dome considered undisturbed, from which the core presented in this paper was collected. The set of dates revealed the presence of marked C-14 date inversions (mechanical disturbances) which, if inappropriately interpreted before the age depth modelling process, may lead to the establishment of misleading chronologies, and thus an incorrect interpretation of biota proxy records, e.g. pollen. Those sections of peat profiles with prominent age inversions and/or strong discrepancies between the peat accumulation rate and bulk density should be rejected from age-depth modelling, even if interpretable chronologies can be obtained.

AB Organic matter and nutrient export from drained peatlands is affected by complex hydrological and biogeochemical interactions. Here partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to relate various soil and catchment characteristics to variations in chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in runoff. Peat core samples and water quality data were collected from 15 peat extraction sites in Finland. PLSR models constructed by cross-validation and variable selection routines predicted 92, 88, and 95% of the variation in mean COD, TN, and TP concentration in runoff, respectively. The results showed that variations in COD were mainly related to net production (temperature and water-extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), hydrology (topographical relief), and solubility of dissolved organic matter (peat sulfur (S) and calcium (Ca) concentrations). Negative correlations for peat S and runoff COD indicated that acidity from oxidation of organic S stored in peat may be an important mechanism suppressing organic matter leaching. Moreover, runoff COD was associated with peat aluminum (Al), P, and sodium (Na) concentrations. Hydrological controls on TN and COD were similar (i.e., related to topography), whereas degree of humification, bulk density, and water-extractable COD and Al provided additional explanations for TN concentration. Variations in runoff TP concentration were attributed to erosion of particulate P, as indicated by a positive correlation with suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and factors associated with metal-humic complexation and P adsorption (peat Al, water-extractable P, and water-extractable iron (Fe)).

SO INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE humic acids; phosphates; mucks; dissolved organic matter
ID AMINO-ACIDS; REMOVAL
AB The impact of phosphates on organic matter release from peat-muck soils was shown. Peat-muck samples were described among others by Water adsorption index, content of amino acids, bulk density, pH, and ash. On the base of obtained data, studied samples were characterized in terms of variable surface charge and possible changes in surface properties of humic acids which might have been under phosphates influence. Nature of studied humic acids were defined by elemental analysis.
   The release of dissolved organic matter from calcium forms of the humic acids was significantly affected by concentration of added salt. Generally, an increase in concentration of phosphates resulted in increasing of humic substances released to the solution up to 0.025 mol dm(-3) of the added salt. At very low, initial phosphate concentration, the secondary coagulation of dissolved organic matter was observed. Potentiometric titration curves of humic acid solutions without addition of phosphate ions showed that studied organic matter was differentiated in relation to variable surface charge. However, titration curves of humic acids with additions of different phosphates concentrations were identical what could indicate that under experiment conditions, phosphates did not influence on structure of humic acid surface.

AB Peat saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-sat, declines strongly with increasing degree of decomposition, providing a potentially important negative ecohydrological feedback that may buffer peatlands from climate-induced drying. However, the quantitative nature of this relationship is poorly understood. We measured downcore changes in K-sat and carbon-to-nitrogen concentration quotients (C/N) in 14 shallow (approximate to 0.5 m deep, 0.1 m diameter) peat cores from a Swedish raised bog. We used the C/N measurements to approximate the fraction of original peat mass remaining. A linear mixed effects (LME) model predicts log(10)(K-sat) from (i) our C/N-derived estimate of fractional remaining mass; (ii) depth; (iii) microhabitat (hummock, hollow); and (iv) location (treeless bog center, treed bog margin). The LME model indicated no significant random effects or interactions between predictors, so we derived a nonlinear multiple regression (NLMR) model to predict K-sat on its original scale. Both LME and NLMR models predict that K-sat decreases exponentially with depth and that K-sat is lower beneath hollows than beneath hummocks for equivalent depths below the surface. Fractional remaining mass was an important predictor in the LME model, but not in the NLMR model. The distinction between central and marginal areas of the bog was not an important predictor. We demonstrate for the first time that the relationship between fractional remaining mass and K-sat is log-linear, and suggest revisions that should be made to peatland development models. In particular, depthusually ignored in modeling studiesexerted a strong control over K-sat independently of decomposition and should be included explicitly in model algorithms.

DT Article
AB A study was conducted to collect, classify and analyze a large number of compost samples to establish a database for determining the relative quality of different types of composts and their potential use based on their hydrological and physicochemical characteristics. Special attention was devoted to the use of compost for flower growing, which extended the analysis to include substrates, such as peats and organic substrates for pot coltures. Some 64 samples of various composts were collected directly from production plants in northern Italy. Depending on the starting raw materials, compost samples were grouped in six categories: sludge compost; animal manure compost; slaughterhouse waste compost; source separated MSW compost; raw MSW compost and yard waste compost. At the same time, 52 samples chosen from among peats and organic substrates, for professional growers and amateur gardeners, were obtained or bought from greenhouses, garden centres and shops. Hydrological and physicochemical properties of the 116 samples (composts, peats and substrates) were determined including: easily available water (EAW), water buffering capacity, (WBC), air capacity, total porosity, bulk density, real density, pH, specific electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon and ash.

ID RUBBER
AB Aggregates produced from finely ground waste glass [Growstones (GS); Earthstone Corp., Santa Fe, NM] have been proposed to adjust the physical properties of peat-based substrates. The GS had a total pore space (TPS) of 87.4% (by volume), which was higher than that of sphagnum peat and perlite but was similar to that of parboiled fresh rice hulls (PBH). The GS had an air-filled pore space (AFP) of 53.1%, which was higher than that of sphagnum peat and perlite but lower than that of PBH. At 34.3%, GS had a lower water-holding capacity (WHC) than sphagnum peat but a higher WHC than either perlite or PBH. The bulk density of GS was 0.19 g.m(-3) and was not different from that of the perlite but was higher than that of sphagnum peat and PBH. The addition of at least 15% GS to sphagnum peat increased the AFP of the resulting peat-based substrate. Substrates containing 25% or 30% GS had a higher AFP than substrates containing equivalent amounts of perlite but a lower AFP than substrates containing equivalent PBH. Substrates containing 20% or more GS had a higher WHC than equivalent perlite- or PBH-containing substrates. Growth of 'Cooler Grape' vines (Catharanthus rose:is), 'Dazzler Lilac Splash' impatiens (Impatiens walleriana), and 'Score Red' geranium (Pelargonium x bortorum) was similar for plants grown in GS-containing substrates and those grown in equivalent perlite- and PBH-containing substrates.

AB Gas bubbles are an important pathway for methane release from peatlands. The mechanisms controlling gas bubble transport and emissions in peat remain uncertain. The effects of hydrostatic pressure and peat structure on the dynamics of gas bubbles in shallow peat were therefore tested in laboratory experiments. A peat monolith was retrieved from a raised bog and maintained in a saturated state. Three distinct layers were identified from noninvasive permittivity measurements supported by soil physical properties (porosity, bulk density). Phase I of the experiment involved monitoring for the accumulation of gas bubbles under steady pressure and temperature conditions. The data showed evidence for gas bubbles being impeded by a shallow semiconfining layer at depths between 10 and 15 cm. Visible gas bubbles observed on the side of the sample box were recorded over time to estimate changes in the vertical distribution of volumetric gas content. Porosity estimates derived using the Complex Refraction Index Model (CRIM) suggest that gas bubbles enlarge the pore space when the exerted pressure is high enough. Phase II involved triggering release of trapped bubbles by repeatedly increasing and decreasing hydrostatic pressure in an oversaturated condition. Comparison of changes in pressure head and methane density in the head space confirmed that the increasing buoyancy force during drops in pressure is more important for triggering ebullition than increasing mobility during increases in pressure. Our findings demonstrate the importance of changes in hydrostatic pressure on bubble size and variations in resistance of the peat fabric in regulating methane releases from peatlands.

AB Methane-climate interactions are reasonably well understood; the biogeochemical controls on net methane fluxes are less so. Within anoxic soils, alternative electron acceptors such as iron and humic substances influence microbial metabolic function, and thus affect the amount of carbon lost as methane (CH4). We present three years of data from wet sedge tundra landscapes near Barrow, Alaska that show an inverse relationship between dissolved iron and CH4 concentrations. We found increasing organic layer thickness related to increases in active layer organic matter content, and decreases in both bulk density and extractable iron. Organic layer depth was also a good proxy for carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 dynamics, with increasing organic layer depths relating to lower dissolved iron, higher amounts of dissolved CH4, and lower CO2:CH4 ratios in the upper active layer. Net CH4 fluxes were also significantly suppressed following the experimental addition of iron and humic acids. Iron and humic acid treatment effects were indistinguishable for CH4 net flux; in contrast, post-treatment CH4 fluxes were an average of 0.74-fold the control treatment flux rates. These results suggest that in-situ CH4 production is tied to alternative electron acceptor availability, and that organic layer thickness is a good predictor of biogeochemical controls on CH4 fluxes in wet-sedge Arctic Alaskan tundra.

AB A high-resolution fen peat record and 79 basal peat dates from paludified peatlands in continental western Canada provide evidence for cyclic change in moisture conditions and in peat carbon accumulation. The ash-free bulk density, a proxy for degree of peat decomposition and thus moisture conditions, shows periodicities at both millennial ( from 1500 to 2190 yr, with a mean of 1785 yr) and century scales ( 386 yr and 667 yr). Wet periods of 200 - 600 yr in duration, especially at similar to 6900, 5500 and 4000 cal. BP, correlate with rapid peat accumulation, new peatland initiation and declines in the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The wet periods in western North America are coeval with warm periods in the North Atlantic, a phasing relationship that has been documented in other published palaeorecords for the glacial period and late Holocene, probably in response to variations in solar activity. These results indicate a strong connection between climate and the global carbon cycle at the millennial scale, mediated in part by peatland dynamics. This is the first demonstration that peatland carbon sequestration rates are highly sensitive even to minor climatic fluctuations, which are too small to produce detectable changes in major species in the peatland. That global atmospheric CO2 concentrations have in the past responded to these changes in peatland dynamics implies a strong potential for peatlands to be a major player in affecting future global change.

AB The management of artificially drained organic soils is a very important issue, since the accelerated mineralization and sometimes peat fires alter physical and chemical properties of soils and the availability of plant nutrients. This study was performed to determine relatively short- and long-term effects of peat fires on some physical and chemical properties of soils in the artificially drained Gavur Lake Peatland of Turkey. To achieve this objective, measured properties of soils burned in 2001, burned in 1965, and unburned were compared. The results indicated that soil bulk density, pH, amounts of soluble salts, CaCO3, and concentrations of ammonium acetate-extractable (AAE) Ca, Mg, K, and Na were significantly higher for both sampling depths in the burned areas. The areas burned in 2001 had higher pH, soluble salts, and the concentrations of AAE Ca, Mg, and K compared with sites burned in 1965, and this was reasoned with leaching losses and plant uptake of these basic cations for four decades in the latter. Percent saturation and organic carbon contents of soils, however, were significantly lower in the burned areas for both sampling depths. Olsen P levels were not significantly different between the sites. This work clearly shows that alterations in soils properties with peat fires do not recover in the long term.

AB A study was conducted to assess the characteristics and the prospective utilization of oil palm waste (OP) and synthetic zeolite (SZ) developed by coal fly ash, as an alternative substrate to peat and commercial perlite for lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) production. The SZ, OP, sphagnum peat (PE), perlite (PL) and two different SZ-OP mixtures (v/v) at the ratio of 1 : 3 and 1 : 10 were utilized as the substrates under this study. The substrates formulated by mixing SZ with OP at the ratio of 1 : 3 and 1 : 10 showed improved substrate physical and chemical properties such as air space, bulk density, particle density, water-holding capacity, pH and electrical conductivity (EC), which were in the ideal substrate range when compared with PL. Furthermore, the water-holding capacity of the substrate having a 1 : 10 mixing ratio of SZ with OP was higher than that of the PL by 28.23%, whereas the bulk density was lower than that of PL by 35%. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to assess the influence of the substrates on the growth and development of lettuce. The shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root fresh weight, root dry weight and number of leaves per plant of the lettuce grown in the 1 : 10 mixing ratio of SZ and OP were the highest, which showed increased values compared with that of PL by 11.56, 9.77, 3.48, 17.35 and 16.53%, respectively. The shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root fresh weight, root dry weight and number of leaves per plant of the lettuce grown in the 1 : 10 mixing ratio of SZ and OP showed increased percentages compared with that of PE by 12.12, 11.37, 3.74, 23.66 and 17.50%, respectively. In addition, the growth and yield parameters of lettuce grown in the 1 : 3 mixing ratio and the OP did not show any significant difference with PL and PE but differed from the 1 : 10 mixing ratio. The results of the study suggest that the SZ-OP-based substrates and OP can be successfully utilized as alternatives to the commercial perlite and to substitute the conventional peat substrate for lettuce cultivation. In addition, this can be proposed as an alternative waste management practice.

AB The Zoige Basin on the eastern Tibetan Plateau has the largest area of highland peatlands in China. However, the development history of these peatlands is still poorly understood. Understanding how these carbon-rich ecosystems responded to change in the Asian summer monsoons during the Holocene will provide insight into the peatland carbon accumulation processes under different climate boundary conditions. Here, we document the timing of initiation and expansion histories of these peatlands using 59 new basal peat ages across the Zoige Basin, with 29 ages for initiation analysis and 30 additional ages for lateral expansion analysis. Also, we synthesized basal ages from 26 sites and carbon accumulation records at four sites from previous studies in this region. The results show that the peatland initiation is widespread at 11.5-10 and 7-6 kyr (1 kyr = 1000 cal. yr BP) and the minimum initiation periods occurred after 5 kyr. Our multiple basal ages along eight transects show that slopes are a dominant control on peatland lateral expansion rates, with very slow and less variable rates at slopes >0.4 degrees. Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between peatland basal ages and peat depths from 85 sites, suggesting relatively uniform peat properties. Carbon accumulation rates from detailed downcore analysis at four sites and on the basis of peat depth-basal age relationship show similar patterns with a peak carbon accumulation at 10-8 kyr. On the basis of estimated mean values of bulk density and carbon content from the region, the Holocene average C accumulation for the Zoige Basin is 31.1 g C/m(2)/yr. The widespread peatland initiation and rapid accumulation in the early Holocene were likely in response to higher temperature and stronger summer monsoon intensity, while the slowdown of peatland development during the late Holocene might have been caused by climate cooling and drying.

AB Wetland ecosystems contain large C stocks and are considered to play an important role in global C cycling, thus having potential implications for global climate change. The Sanjiang Plain wetland is the largest freshwater marsh in China and a principle element of the Wetlands of International Importance with three Ramsar wetland sites (Xingkai Lake, Sanjiang, and Honghe) since 2002. Nevertheless, little is known about organic C storage, and no data combining both long-and short-term C accumulation rates have been reported for this region. We used 10 cores collected from previous investigations to determine radiocarbon age and long-term (apparent) rate of C accumulation (LORCA) based on dry bulk density and organic C content; we used five recent cores representing the three main wetland types in Sanjiang Plain to estimate the recent (apparent) rate of C accumulation (RERCA) inferred from Pb-210 dating. The LORCA ranged from 5 to 61 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with an average of 22 +/- 5 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE), and the RERCA ranged from 170 to 384 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with a mean of 264 +/- 45 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE). Th e average C flux was 0.05 Tg C yr(-1) for herbaceous peatland, 0.02 Tg C yr(-1) for humus marsh, and 0.03 Tg C yr(-1) for marshy meadow and the total soil C pool in Sanjiang Plain wetlands was estimated to be 0.36 Pg C. Our results are in good agreement with other published relevant data and may be useful for predicting global climate change. Th e Sanjiang Plain wetlands deserve more attention in wetland protection and restoration of the wetland ecosystem and wise use of wetlands for agricultural development.

AB This paper describes the impact of drainage and grassland use on selected soil parameters (e.g. organic carbon content, bulk density) of typical fen soils in Northeast Germany and, hence, their influence on grassland productivity. A broad investigation of site conditions has been realized at 23 grassland fields concerning soil properties, vegetation attributes and groundwater dynamics. Collectively selected fields represent characteristic types of grassland management and stages of moorsh-forming process. Concerning the entire sample, site conditions of agriculturally used peatlands vary strongly. Based on that complex data-set, the importance of defined potential impact factors on grassland production is tested and expressed in a linear regression model. Annual yield of the 2011 growing season, as a quantitative parameter of grassland productivity, does not indicate any correlation to site-specific conditions or cultivation strategy. In contrast, energy content as a qualitative measure varies strongly in relation to defined environmental parameters. Model performance is indicated with an adjusted R-square of 0.89 while the main impact factors are annual use frequency, mean summer water table (MSWT), maximum groundwater drawdown (GWmax), and organic carbon content (Corg).

AB Purpose In delta areas, dense networks of canals have been developed through time and have to be periodically dredged. Lowering the groundwater level in delta areas deepens the aerobic zone, leading to the oxidation of organic matter and possibly to land subsidence. The use of the dredged sediments on land can be a solution to mitigate land subsidence in delta areas.
   Materials and methods Five types of dredged sediments with different organic matter content and particle size distribution were dewatered for 7 days and then submitted to biochemical ripening during 141 days on a laboratorial scale with constant temperature and relative humidity. The functional properties analysed were the type and content of organic matter, pH, total C, N, P and S, dry bulk density, water retention capacity, aggregate stability and load-bearing capacity.
   Results and discussion After biochemical ripening, there was no significant loss in the mass of organic matter but there was an increase in the fraction of stable organic compounds, observed by an increase in oxygen-bearing compounds and a decrease in hydrocarbons during biochemical ripening. The pH was not affected by biochemical ripening, and the total C, N, P and S concentrations are high and therefore the dredged sediments can improve the quality of the land. Most volume lost during dewatering and biochemical ripening can be attributed to the loss of water. The water retention capacity of the dredged sediments changed with biochemical ripening. The soils formed from biochemical ripening have very stable aggregates, and its load-bearing capacity is enough to sustain cattle and tractors.
   Conclusions Most volume lost during dewatering and biochemical ripening can be attributed to the loss of water and not organic matter. Therefore, the studied dredged sediments have potential to mitigate land subsidence in delta areas when spread on land.

AB A peat core from a mire with poor fen lawns and ombrotrophic hummock strings in Northern Sweden was examined (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, testate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk densities, loss on ignition) to investigate the effects of climate change and human impact on the plant species composition and peat accumulation of the peat forming vegetation during the last 1700 yr. C-14 wiggle-match dating was applied for high-precision dating. The Lappmyran region was dominated by Pinus and Picea forest. Changes in land-use patterns and population density were visible in the pollen record of the regional vegetation. Juniperus and Rumex acetosa-type pollen indicated the presence of grazed land in the area between AD 1500 and 1950. The vegetation at the coring spot gradually became ombrotrophic. The local plant and testate amoebae compositions reflect changes in surface wetness caused by changes in precipitation and the internal dynamics of the bog. A wet interval was observed during the Maunder minimum of solar activity. The presence of Drepanocladus fluitans indicates less ombrotrophic conditions during this period probably caused by the inflow of minerogenic water from upslope owing to increased precipitation. The reconstructed water table shows agreement with precipitation measurements which were available since AD 1860. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using perlite substrates over several growing seasons is widely done in greenhouse production; its successful application depends on substrate modification and growing practices. The goal of this research was to characterize the evolution of the physical, hydraulic, and aeration properties of perlite with time within two parts of the pot, where the effect of solarization was also determined. New perlite and perlite that had been used one to four times as growing media were analyzed, and the induced modifications were measured in terms of the hydraulic retention, permeability at saturation, porosity, bulk density, water-holding capacity, and particle size distribution. The study showed that reuse influences the perlite particle size and reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the medium; the aeration properties and easily available water were improved by reuse, which supports crop growth. However, the variations found in this study from the reused substrates' hydraulic features would not significantly modify the irrigation regime of the growing media inside a greenhouse. The solarization did not substantially alter the primary physical and hydraulic properties of the medium. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

To meet this requirement, methods are needed (1) to measure the hydraulic properties and (2) to evaluate the hydraulic quality of the horticultural substrates. The aim of this study was (1) to test the extended evaporation method and the HYPROP systems for quantifying the substrate's hydraulic properties (the water retention curve, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function, the shrinkage dynamics, the bulk density), and (2) to develop a rating framework for assessing the hydraulic suitability of the substrates. The hydraulic evaluation was split into cultivation under free drainage in the ground and cultivation in containers. The hydraulic criteria related to high-quality horticultural substrates were defined as the amount of easily plant-available water, the air capacity and the height of capillary rise. Limiting factors could be water repellency effects and shrinkage. The rating framework consists of five classes between non-satisfactory and very good. It was tested on 23 commercial horticultural substrates. Both the measurement methods for quantifying soil hydraulic properties and the evaluation procedure proved applicable.

AB Increased use of recycled water along with inherent soil salinity problems on golf courses make salinity an important issue for golf course management. The objective of this study was to investigate if using humus on golf fairways by topdressing or spraying can alleviate soil salinity problems and improve turf quality. The study was conducted from 2015 to 2017 at Aurora, CO, and Medora, ND. Treatments included an untreated control, topdressing (sand, sand + peat), and spraying of humic acid. Our results showed that the application of humus increased the soil microbial biomass and improved turf quality on fairways either with a soil salinity problem or irrigated with recycled water. The effects on turfgrass health and turf quality were dependent on the rates of humus applied. Humic acid at 3 gal/acre was equivalent to topdressing sand + peat (80/20 v/v) and consistently showed improved turf quality over the untreated control. Soil properties also were affected by the application of humus. Soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), bulk density, water infiltration, and microbial biomass may have had an indirect contribution to turf quality.

AB The microbial activity and bacterial community structure were investigated in two types of peat soil in a temperate marsh. The first, a drained grassland fen soil, has a neutral pH with partially degraded peat in the upper oxic soil horizons (16% soil organic carbon). The second, a bog soil, was sampled in a swampy forest and has a very high soil organic carbon content (45%), a low pH (45), and has occasional anoxic conditions in the upper soil horizons due to the high water table level. The microbial activity in the two soils was measured as the basal and substrate-induced respiration (SIR). Unexpectedly, the SIR (mu l CO2 g(-1) dry soil) was higher in the bog than in the fen soil, but lower when CO2 production was expressed per volume of soil. This may be explained by the notable difference in the bulk densities of the two soils. The bacterial communities were assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling of 16S rRNA genes and indicated differences between the two soils. The differences were determined by the soil characteristics rather than the season in which the soil was sampled. The 16S rRNA gene libraries, constructed from the two soils, revealed high proportions of sequences assigned to the Acidobacteria phylum. Each library contained a distinct set of phylogenetic subgroups of this important group of bacteria. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this research was to investigate the morphology, genesis and classification of organic soils formed on depression and flat land around Lake Yenicaga, west-central Turkey. Formation of the area has been influenced by tectonic and karst processes. This peatland is important in this area due to its extensive use as a horticultural plant growth medium resulting from positive physical and chemical properties. Organic soils in the study area were formed in nutrient-rich conditions and it is classified as typical basin peat. Four representative pedons were excavated in the study area based on extensive observations performed with random grid method using an auger. Samples were taken from horizons in each profile for laboratory analyses. Organic matter contents ranged from 12.5 to 91.5% across all four pedons. Fiber contents were between 4.3 and 91.5%, and N ranged from 0.56 to 2.19%. Cation exchange capacity ranged from 37 to 222 cmol kg(-1), bulk density from 0.09 to 0.78 g cm(-3), lime from 0.15 to 2.62%. The pH and EC(e) values ranged from 5.38 to 7.92 and 0.50 to 3.80 dS m(-1), respectively. Sand, silt and clay contents of the organic soils ranged between 0.75-3.92, 40.70-74.77 and 24.15-57.30%, respectively. Differences in organic soils were found to depend on the environment, botanical origins, decomposition degrees, and groundwater composition. The organic soils of the research area were classified in the typic, hemic and hydric subgroups of Medifibrists (Soil Taxonomy 1999).

AB Fire has considerable impact on vegetation and organic soils properties. As we observed that the differences between vegetation of burnt and unburnt areas on the rich fen are visible 11 years after the fire, we assumed that the post-fire changes are long lasting, yet limited exclusively to the burnt areas. In order to check this hypothesis we studied spatial differentiation of physical and chemical properties of soils, and productivity capacities of burnt and unburnt areas in the fen in Biebrza National Park. We took soil samples from the neighboring burnt and unburnt areas, from the depth of 0-30 cm and 30-50 cm. We analyzed 21 parameters of the soils including: pH, ash content, moisture, bulk density, exchangeable K,Na, Ca, available P, N-NH4+, N-NO3-, total N, C, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, P; and calculated C: N, C: P ratios. Surface layer of the burnt soils differed significantly from the unburnt soils in respect of 17 out of 21 parameters. The most pronounced difference was observed for available phosphorous (on average 6 times higher for the burnt soils). The differences in the deeper layer were mostly insignificant. The burnt areas were also characterized by twofold higher plant productivity than recorded for the unburnt areas. The influence of fire on peaty soils was long lasting but mostly limited to the surface layer of the soils. In the case of particular soil features, the post-fire differences were modified by advanced muck formation (moorshing) processes in the unburnt areas. Since the fire led to long lasting increase of fertility, the recovery of fen vegetation is unlikely.

AB Pulp and paper mills often burn wood waste to fuel their boilers. The ash from a Mississippi pulp mill boiler was evaluated for potential use as an amendment to peat moss-based greenhouse substrates for production of young tomato plants. Between 0 and 50% ash was added to a custom-blended peat moss-based substrate, and these were compared to a commercially available substrate without ash. Addition of ash increased substrate pH, conductivity (EC), bulk density and water holding capacity, while reducing airspace and average particle size. In general, tomato plants grown in 0{40% ash had similar growth indexes as plants grown in commercial substrate. Increasing amounts of ash decreased tomato shoot nitrogen (N), potassium (K), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) concentration, and increased concentrations of phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), and boron (B). These results indicate that pulp mill ash has the potential to be used as a substrate component for greenhouse container production of tomato.

TI COMPOSITION OF CARBON FRACTIONS AND POTENTIAL DENITRIFICATION IN DRAINED
   PEAT SOILS
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The organic matter of five low-moor peat soils and one eutrophic raised-bog peat soil was chemically characterized by C fractionation and ion-exchange chromatography of amino acids and carbohydrates.  C fractions were related to potential denitrification, D(pot), as a measure of microbial activity and C availability, determined by the acetylene inhibition technique.  Chemical and physical properties vary distinctively between different kinds of peat, and show increasing C/N ratio and decreasing bulk density and ash content within the profile.  Generally, the carbon composition reflects the geobotanical origin of the peat.  In most samples more than 65% of organic C consists of non-hydrolysable C.  Readily hydrolysable neutral sugar C represents up to about 12% of organic C, usually decreasing with depth.  The recalcitrant fraction of neutral sugar C is much smaller (1 to 4.2% of organic C) and does not vary with depth.  The content of readily hydrolysable glucose exhibits a strong profile differentiation that decreases with depth whereas the higher contents of recalcitrant glucose carbon (12/0.5 M H2SO4) in the lower peat horizons reflect their cellulose character.  Regression analysis between D(pot) and single C components explains up to 51.5% of the variability.  Combining fractions which point to C availability (readily hydrolysable glucose) and microbial metabolism (amino acids), it is possible to estimate D(pot) with a certainty of more than 80%.

AB This work studied the use of waste from the breeding of broiler on different types of bedding material (straw or sawdust) and its mixture with two commercial peat substrates (black peat and Sphagnum peat). The aim of this study was to achieve the formulation of substrates for the production of ornamental plants, which would reduce the use of peat as the major substrate. Physical and hydrophysical characterization were carried out on two types of materials: manure from the breeding of broiler on straw and broiler on sawdust. Each material was mixed with black peat and Sphagnum peat at 0 and 10 % (v/v). In relation to the physical and hydrophysical properties of the substrates studied, results showed a low bulk density, a high porosity and excessive water retention. From the curve humidity to low suctions, it was found that the mixtures had a good aeration capacity. This aeration capacity of all of the mixtures was greater than 20, except for the substrate obtained by mixing 90 black peat and 10 broiler sawdust. Moreover the water easily usable and the water buffering capacity is poor in water and hardly usable water is very high. Finally, the R parameter (cm of water column height to which the parameter volumes of water and air are equal), show that these substrates have sufficient water easily usable.

AB A greenhouse experiment was conducted to assess the performance of biochar obtained from pyrolysis of conifer wood as a substrate component for growing potted Rosa rugosa plants. Rose plants were grown with different mixtures of sphagnum peat and biochar (100% peat, 75% peat-25% biochar, 50% peat-50% biochar, 25% peat-75% biochar; v:v). Increasing the biochar content from 25% to 75% increased the air content, bulk density, electrical conductivity, and K and Na concentration in the substrates. The addition of 25% biochar to the substrate showed promising potential for R. rugosa when compared with 100% peat given the similar growth performance, water-use efficiency, and ornamental quality (number of flowers and leaf colour). The Ca and Na concentrations in leaves and roots as well as the Mg content in roots increased as the biochar percentage in the substrate increased, whereas an opposite trend was observed for P and K concentrations. The best performance and ornamental quality of R. rugosa grown with 100% peat and 75% peat-25% biochar compared with 50 and 75% biochar treatments were attributed to a higher degree of photosynthesis, Soil Plant Analysis Development index, and pigment content. Overall, adding 25% of conifer wood biochar as a substrate component could be applied for economic purposes without detrimental effects on the yield and quality of potted roses.

AB The natural carbon storage function of peatland ecosystems can be severely affected by the abandonment of peat extraction, influencing peatland drainage, leading to large and persistent sources of atmospheric CO2. Moreover, these cutover peatlands have a low and variable water table position and high tension at the surface, creating harsh ecohydrological conditions for vegetation re-establishment, particularly peat forming Sphagnum moss. Standard restoration techniques aim to restore the peatland to a carbon accumulating system through various water management techniques to improve hydrological conditions and by reintroducing Sphagnum at the surface. However, restoring the hydrology of peatlands can be expensive due to the cost of implementing the various restoration techniques. This study examines a peat extraction-restoration technique where the acrotelm is preserved and replaced directly on the cutover peat surface. An experimental peatland adopting this acrotelm transplant technique had both a high water table and peat moisture conditions providing sufficient water at the surface for Sphagnum moss. Average water table conditions were higher at the experimental site (-8.4 +/- 4.2 cm) compared to an adjacent natural site (-12.7 +/- 6.0 cm) suggesting adequate moisture conditions at the restored surface. However, the experimental site experienced high variability in volumetric moisture content (VMC) in the capitula zone (upper 2 cm) where large diurnal changes in VMC (similar to 30%) were observed, suggesting possible disturbance to the peat matrix structure during the extraction-restoration process. However, soil-water retention analysis and physical peat properties (porosity and bulk density) suggest that no significant differences existed between the natural and experimental sites. Any structural changes within the peat matrix were therefore minimal. Moreover, low soil-water tensions were maintained well above the laboratory measured critical Sphagnum threshold of 33% (-100 mb) VMC, further indicating favourable conditions for Sphagnum moss survival and growth.

AB The Changbai Mountain range is a well-known and important mountain chain in northeast China, bordering the Korean Peninsula in the south. It is also one of the areas most sensitive to global change. Massive peatlands that play a key role in the global carbon (C) cycle are found in this region. Estimating and assessing C dynamics in Changbai Mountain peatlands is of great importance to local sustainable development. Dry bulk density and C content analyses based on 8 selected peat cores dated by Pb-210 were used to estimate recent rates of carbon accumulation (RERCA, g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in Changbai Mountain peatlands. RERCA ranged from 124.2 to 292.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (average 199.6 +/- 60.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Obvious increasing trends in RERCA were observed in all peat cores. The C pool for 200 years was 38.5-52.1 kg C m(-2), which can supplement the database of C pools for Changbai Mountain ecosystems. The Pb-210 radiometric technique was tested and found to be a useful study method for recent terrestrial carbon sequestration. This study could contribute to a better understanding of rarely studied mountain peatlands in China and may be useful to global mountain and climate change research.

AB To evaluate the effects of changes in water level and temperatures on performance of four Sphagnum mosses, S. magellanicum, S. rubellum, S. imbricatum and S. fuscum were grown at two water levels, -5 cm and -15 cm, and at two temperatures, 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. These species differ in their position along the microtopographical gradient and in their geographical distribution. Height increment, subcapitulum bulk density, biomass production, capitulum water content and cumulative evaporation were measured. Height increment and biomass production of S. magellanicum was lower at low water table than at high water table, whereas height increment and biomass production of S. rubellum, S. imbricatum and S. fuscum were unaffected. Height increment of S. magellanicum, S. rubellum and S. imbricatum was higher at high temperature than at low temperature. Biomass production of only S. magellanicum and S. rubellum was higher at high temperature than at low temperature, corresponding with their more southern distribution. Cumulative evaporation of S. magellanicum and S. rubellum was lower at low water table and could be explained by hampered water transport towards the capitula. We conclude that changes in water table and temperature may alter the Sphagnum composition on raised bogs, which may result in changes to important ecosystem processes. Therefore, it is important that species composition and changes therein are taken into account when evaluating global change effects on raised bog ecosystems.

AB Various formulations are used in horticultural potting media, with sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite and perlite currently among the most common components. We are examining a dried anaerobic digestate remaining after the fermentation of potato processing wastes to replace organic components such as peat moss, and biochars produced from several feedstocks as replacements for inorganic media components such as vermiculite and perlite. Biochars were prepared using a top-lit updraft pyrolytic stove from wood pellets, pelletized wheat straw and field pennycress presscake. Biochar yields and heats of combustion were highest with the field pennycress presscake and lowest with the wood pellets. Because all three biochars had basic pHs, they were treated with citric acid solutions to lower pH values to 6.0 before being used in plant experiments. All three acidified biochars were combined in 1:1 ratios with the digestate and compared against a 1:1 sphagnum peat moss:vermiculite control substrate containing slow-release chemical fertilizers. All digestate:biochar substrates had higher bulk densities and levels of soluble salts than the control. Greenhouse experiments were conducted using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) plants grown in 2.5-L pots. Combining potato anaerobic digestate with acidified wood pellet biochar resulted in increased growth of tomato plants as compared to the peat:vermiculite control, while the digestate:acidified wheat straw pellet biochar substrate was equal to the control for marigold growth. Plants of both species grown in the digestate:pennycress presscake biochar substrate had less growth than the control. From these results it appears that both the digestate:acidified wood pellet biochar and the digestate:acidified straw pellet biochar would likely be acceptable alternatives to peat:vermiculite substrates, and would also be an option for certified organic producers.

SO COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID AMENDMENT
AB Composts, used alone or in mixtures with other materials, can serve as horticultural potting media in organic production systems. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of two locally available composts as media for lettuce and tatsoi produced organically in an unheated greenhouse. One of the composts was produced from food residuals with landscape wastes as a bulking agent, while the other was generated from used horse bedding. Although the two materials had relatively similar total N contents, C:N ratios, and bulk densities, they performed very differently as potting media. Net N mineralization, measured in laboratory incubations, was high in the compost derived from food residuals, but the horse-bedding compost showed net N immobilization, perhaps due to high salinity. Crop production in the food residuals compost was statistically similar to a control treatment consisting of a commercial peat-based potting medium with synthetic fertilizer. Crop growth in the medium consisting of horse-bedding compost, used at 100% or in a 50% / 50% mixture with a commercial substrate of bark, peat, and sand, was unacceptable for commercial production. Although the cost per flat of the food residuals compost was slightly higher than that of the commercial peat-based medium, for organic production this additional cost may be insignificant since there are limited potting media options, and price premiums are typically available.

AB Ground beetles and vegetation were sampled at 74 sites on an area of moorland in Northumberland. Pitfall traps and permanent quadrat points were used to obtain ground beetle presence/absence and vegetation percentage cover data sets. Each data set was ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DECORANA) and classified by fuzzy clustering. Five ground beetle communities and three broad vegetation types were recognised from the analyses of each of the data sets. Spearman rank correlation indicated that the distributions of the sites in both ordinations were primarily related to soil environmental variable measurements - pH, moisture content, dry bulk density and organic matter content. The groupings of sites obtained from the carabid and vegetation analyses were compared using the log-likelihood ratio test in a contingency table and by Procrustes rotation of the vegetation ordination scoes onto the ground beetle ordination scores. Results obtained indicated that there were variations in the closeness of the associations between the ground beetle and vegetation groups recognised. The potential for using the techniques to allow predictions of ecological change to be made are discussed.

AB Over a six year period, lowering of the water table throughout the year in two Danish eutrophic fens led to an increase in bulk density and a decrease in pH, exchangeable base cations, total P, available P, and available Mn. The vascular plant flora and ecological characteristics of the vegetation (weighted Moisture-value, Drainage Index, Nitrogen-value and Reaction-value, and proportion of fen species, of different growth forms, and of different seed dispersal types) changed in accordance with changes in water regime towards more dry conditions, changes of edaphic variables towards more acid and oligotrophic conditions, and increased probability of establishment of plants on patches without vegetation.
   Additional two years with reestablishment of the original winter water table in one of the fens led to a further decrease in total P and available P. Most of the non-fen species, which had established in the period with low water table throughout the year, were significantly weakened. However, after a period of two years with reestablished winter water table the vegetation was still different from the original vegetation. Methods to state the statistical significance of changes in frequency of species and ecological characteristics of the vegetation have been worked out.

AB The objectives of this study were to determine the chemical and physical properties of tequila blue agave bagasse composted with tequila vinasses' biosolids in coconut based powder substrates for potted plants and to compare their performance against two commercial substrates. The substrates evaluated included coconut powder, Canadian peat, 100 % compost, and 3-coconut powder based mixtures containing 30 %, 50 %, and 70 % compost. Chemical parameters analyzed comprise organic matter, pH, conductivity, cation exchange capacity, total organic carbon, C/N ratio, total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium. The physical properties evaluated included bulk density, particle density, total porous spaces, free water, bound water, absorbed water and particle size distribution. We were able to demonstrate that the formulations of agave bagasse compost and coconut powder could replace coconut powder and peat, since their physical and chemical characteristics are suitable for its use as substrate for plants cultivated in containers. The treatments with better results were those with 30 %, 50 %, and 100 % compost. Composting waste materials provide additional benefits including a reduction in environmental pollution as well as the local production of substrates for protected agriculture systems, which require substantial quantities of these type of materials.

AB Rooted cuttings of Cotoneaster dammeri cv. 'Coral Beauty' were grown in containers in combinations of source-separated municipal solid waste (MSW) compost and peat (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 by volume), or spruce bark compost and peat (similar proportions) in each of the two consecutive years. MSW compost was obtained from the same commercial composting facility, but it was not consistent in chemical composition, bulk density, soluble salt content or pH from year to year. Plant growth, substrate physical properties and end-of-season foliar nutrient levels were measured for all media treatments. Soluble salt content was initially high in media containing MSW, but declined to <1 mS cm(-1) within 1 month of potting. Plant growth in MSW-based media was equal to, or greater than that in bark-based media, and was similar for both years. Poorest growth was obtained in 100% bark, and 100% MSW media, but growth was strong at ratios up to and including 75:25 MSW:peat. End-of-season foliar nutrient levels were higher in 1997 than in 1996 in MSW-grown plants, reflecting the generally higher nutrient concentrations in the 1997 compost. Heavy metal uptake was no greater in MSW than in bark media and there were no signs of nutrient deficiency or toxicity at any time during the study. The results indicate that despite inherent variability in the texture and composition of composted MSW, it could form a useful component of a standardized growing medium for woody nursery plants.

AB Microbial-inoculated phospho-feather compost (PIFRM) was manufactured by inoculating Arthrobacter ureafaciens K10 and Streptomyces sp. CP3 into compost composed of spent mushroom waste (SMW), duck feathers (DF), pitaya pruning waste (PPW) and rock phosphate. PIFRM was slightly acidic; carbon to nitrogen ratio was 11.1; electric conductivity (EC) (1:10) was 5.5 dS m(-1); bulk density (BD) was 0.3 g cm(-3), and germination index (GI) was 164.7%. Seven culture media: PIFRM, coconut fiber (CF), coconut fiber mixed with PIFRM in a 1:1 volume ratio (CF-PIFRM 1:1), coconut fiber mixed with PIFRM in a 3:1 volume ratio (CF-PIFRM 3:1), peat (P), peat mixed with PIFRM in a 1:1 volume ratio (P-PIFRM 1:1) and peat mixed with PIFRM in a 3:1 volume ratio (P-PIFRM 3:1) were evaluated for the production of two melon harvests without additional fertilization. The highest fruit weight and total soluble solids (TSS) obtained in the first cultivation cycle was from treatment with CF-PIFRM 1:1. Fruit weight significantly decreased in treatment with CF-PIFRM 3:1, due to high potassium to calcium ratio (7.1) in the medium. In the second cultivation cycle, commercially viable fruit was only produced in planted PIFRM.

AB Smouldering combustion is the slow, low-temperature, flameless burning of porous fuels and the most important phenomenon of wildfires in peatlands. Smouldering fires propagate both horizontally and vertically through organic layers of the ground and can reach deep into the soil. In this work, we develop a one-dimensional computational model of reactive porous media in the open-source code Gpyro. We investigate the vertical in-depth spread of smouldering fires into peat columns 20cm deep with heterogeneous profiles of moisture content (MC), inert content (IC) and density. The model solves the species, momentum and energy conservation equations with five-step heterogeneous chemistry, to predict the transient profiles of temperature, species concentration, reaction rates and depth of burn from ignition to spread and to extinction. Modelling results reveal that smouldering combustion can spread over peat layers with very high MC (>250%) if the layer is thin and located below a thick, drier layer. It is shown that the critical moisture for extinction can be much higher than the previously reported critical MC for ignition (e.g. extinction MC up to 256% for low-IC peat, with critical ignition MC of 117%). The predicted critical MC values and depths of burn are compared with experimental measurements for field samples in the literature, showing good agreement. This study provides the physical understanding of the role of moisture in the ignition and extinction of smouldering peat fires, and explains for the first time the phenomenon of smouldering in very wet peat layers.

ID PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; MOISTURE; BEHAVIOR; BOG
AB In this paper concerned with soil water dynamics in a managed cutover peat field, the microscale hydrological processes and parameters governing water flow and storage through variably saturated peat are investigated. An open water ditch-reservoir enhanced wetting of adjacent cutover peat, maintaining the water table depth above 43 cm during the summer, surface soil moisture above 45%, and water tension in the surface layer above -45 mbar. Desaturation of pores was noted in the -2 and -10 cm depths, but at -30 and -50 cm a decrease in moisture content of several percent was associated with compression of the peat as the water table dropped. Air entry occurred only at pressures below -15 mbar. Seasonal subsidence resulted in cumulative vertical displacement in excess of 10 cm during the study period. Typical settlements in the peat ranged between 11 and 23% of the lowering of the water table. Considerable hysteresis was observed, and vertical displacement was 5 times greater in response to water loss, compared to rewetting. The specific storage (S-s) in the 180 cm thick deposit averaged 9.4 x 10(-4) cm(-1) during drying periods but averaged only 2.6 x 10-4 cm(-1) on rewetting. S-s was more important than specific yield (S-s) in the overall aquifer storativity. Transient hydraulic properties resulted from the shifting soil structure. The increase in peat bulk density caused by drying increased the water retention capacity and decreased hydraulic conductivity. Mean saturated hydraulic conductivity was 15 cm d(-1) and decreased 2 orders of magnitude as the degree of saturation dropped from 1 to 0.4. The horizontal/vertical anisotropy ratio was 4. The changing surface elevation in response to seasonal subsidence had a profound influence on the nature of the storage changes and hydraulic parameters of the peat soil.

ID GROUNDWATER; TRANSPORT; WATER; PEAT
AB Intensive P fertilizer application is widely practised in East Mediterranean altered wetland soils, even when results from the Olsen-P extract indicate sufficiency (>10mg P/kg). To reduce or even eliminate this practice we conducted a large field study to test the feasibility of a major reduction in the use of P fertilizers. A total of 90 sample sites were evenly spaced with respect to their parent material (deep peat, shallow peat, marl). Soils were analysed for Olsen-P, bulk density, pH, electrical conductivity, and nitrate, chloride and sulphate in saturated paste extracts. We determined variograms and estimated the spatial structure of Olsen-P data by ordinary kriging. We then used a sequential Gaussian model to produce 100 alternative simulations to measure the joint spatial uncertainty of P concentrations in the study area (ca.1500ha). Finally, we post-processed the simulation results to compute the probability of exceeding the threshold Olsen-P value of 10mg/kg. The simulation results indicate a high probability of exceeding the 10mg/kg threshold in most peat soils supporting an earlier recommendation to reduce or even eliminate P fertilizer application in these fields. On the other hand, a very low probability of exceeding this threshold was observed in most marl soils justifying continued fertilizer application. However, the added P is likely to affect adjacent waterways and increase potential downstream eutrophication due to high conductance and flow continuity between the marl soils and adjacent waterways.

AB Mobility, exchangeability and accumulation of macro elements and heavy metals after liming and fertilization of organic soils were studied on three sites, two oligotrophic and one mesotrophic. These were drained, fertilized and/or limed in 1953-1956 and sampled in 1991-1992. Fertilization and liming caused marginal changes in bulk density, N stores and C/N ratios, while percentage ash content increased significantly to 40 cm depth at the two oligotrophic sites and to 10 cm at the mesotrophic site. Applied P was relatively immobile and liming caused more P to accumulate in the surface layer, whereas applied K and Mg were mobile with elevated concentrations being measured to 60 cm depth at the oligotrophic sites. Even if liming reduced the relative exchangeable pools of Fe and Al these elements moved to this depth after combined fertilization and liming, but mobility was less after liming alone. Relative exchangeable pools of K, Ca and Mg were high, of Fe and Al intermediate to low and of S and P low. The relative exchangeable P pools were site and treatment specific. The "old P pool" of organic soils seemed quite stable and strongly fixed, while the "new P pool" from fertilizer P probably had higher exchange ratio. Increased stores of Cr, Ni, Sr and Ti resulted from impurities in both fertilizer and lime, Cu from the compound fertilizer, and V and Y probably from the P fertilizer. Stores of Pb were not significantly changed by the treatments; those of Zn was unchanged after liming or even reduced after combined fertilization and liming. The Cu and Pb concentrations were sometimes above the suggested critical levels of toxicity.

AB Peatlands constitute extremely valuable areas because of their ability to store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Investigating different key peat soil properties, such as the extent, thickness (or depth to mineral soil) and bulk density, is highly relevant for the precise calculation of the amount of stored SOC at the field scale. However, conventional peat coring surveys are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, and indirect mapping methods based on proximal sensors appear as a powerful supplement to traditional surveys. The aim of the present study was to assess the use of a non-invasive electromagnetic induction (EMI) technique as an augmentation to a traditional peat coring survey that provides localized and discrete measurements. In particular, a DUALEM-421S instrument was used to measure the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) over a 10-ha field located in Jutland, Denmark. In the study area, the peat thickness varied notably from north to south, with a range from 3 to 730 cm. Simple and multiple linear regressions with soil observations from 110 sites were used to predict peat thickness from (a) raw ECa measurements (i.e., single and multiple-coil predictions), (b) true electrical conductivity (sigma) estimates calculated using a quasi-three-dimensional inversion algorithm and (c) different combinations of ECa data with environmental covariates (i.e., light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based elevation and derived terrain attributes). The results indicated that raw ECa data can already constitute relevant predictors for peat thickness in the study area, with single-coil predictions yielding substantial accuracies with coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.63 to 0.86 and root mean square error (RMSE) values between 74 and 122 cm, depending on the measuring DUALEM-421S coil configuration. While the combinations of ECa data (both single and multiple-coil) with elevation generally provided slightly higher accuracies, the uncertainty estimates for single-coil predictions were smaller (i.e., smaller 95% confidence intervals). The present study demonstrates a high potential for EMI data to be used for peat thickness mapping.

AB Heathlands are among the most important semi-natural cultural landscapes in Northwestern Europe. High-intensity management techniques are necessary to restore and maintain their unique flora and fauna, but generate substantial amounts of residues that have no sustainable reuse so far. This research therefore aims at characterizing these residues and at evaluating their potential as soil amendment or growing medium constituent. Residues are primarily characterized based on their origin and on the management technique used to extract them. We evaluated the spatial distribution of the different residue types and assessed if the used typology also reflects the physicochemical characteristics of the extracted product, by cluster analysis. Finally, the characteristics of the residues were compared with industrial standards and legal limits for growing media or soil amendments and to other growing media constituents. Our results show a difference between extraction techniques, where sods (plaggen) from forests and heathlands have higher bulk densities, lower organic matter contents, lower organic compounds and lower biodegradation potential, compared to heathland chopper. Analyses further confirm the potential of the residues as a raw material for growing media or soil amendments. pH and EC values fall within acceptable ranges (< 6 and < 750 mu S/cm) and nutrient contents are low, with beneficial effects on C:N and C:P ratios. Field and pot experiments are now needed to evaluate effects on plant growth.

AB Failing head (and a few rising head) measurements were made of hydraulic conductivity k in a profile of a 7 m deep, small raised bog in southwest Scotland. The seven piezometer pipes were 39 mm diameter, and most of the measurements were made with attached tubes of 2.5 mm diameter, so that only 2-3 mm of water crossed the peat inter-face during a run. There were no consistent effects of pre-flushing, direction of flow (failing, rising), or measuring-tube size. Variability of 10-20% in k did not obscure an exponential decrease with depth from 5 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) at 100 cm to 0.7 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) at 500 cm. This decrease was uncorrelated with dry bulk density or peat stiffness, and only loosely so with a measure of humification. Calculated mean bulk velocity of pore water may be as low as 1 mm year(-1). Pressure in the silty sand below the peat was 180 mbar less than expected, suggesting a thin highly impermeable layer ('pan'?) at the peat base. The substratum may have hydrological connection with an adjacent lake. The hydraulic properties of this raised bog contrast strongly with those of a raised bog in Minnesota, and do not fit the assumptions made for Ingram's simple groundwater mound model of raised bog shape.

AB Little is known how soil type may interact with fertilization in affecting carbon fluxes in wet grasslands, habitats of high conservation value which have decreased in area due to agricultural intensification. A nutrient (NPK) addition experiment, with three treatment levels in a block design, was established to compare nutrient effects on particular carbon fluxes (plant production and nutrient contents, and plant and soil respiration) in two wet grasslands in the Czech Republic, with either organic or mineral soil. Between-site and treatment differences were tested by one and twoway ANOVA; temporal changes by repeated measures ANOVA. We hypothesized that the organic site would be more sensitive to nutrient additions. Aboveground biomass and total dark CO2 emissions increased significantly with nutrient addition in the organic, but not the mineral, site, thus supporting our hypothesis. Hay removal and the short duration of fertilization (3 years) may account for the lack of other significant effects. Soil properties (bulk density, C:N ratio, microbial community structure) likely underlie these differences between the wet grasslands, although site hydrology and plant species composition may also be important. Soil type, as well as the other factors, must be considered when restoring or managing for well-functioning, resilient wet grasslands.

AB The physical-hydraulic properties of eight substrate mixtures based on sphagnum peat and coir were determined and their effect on the growth of Begonia xelatior was studied. The particle size distribution, water retention curve, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and pore size distribution of the substrates were determined. All substrates exhibited high total porosity, satisfactory water retention capacity, and high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Increasing the percentage of perlite in the mixtures contributed to the reduction of water retention capacity and the increase of large pores. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity estimated by the Mualem-van Genuchten model showed a sharp decrease within a range of water pressure heads (0 to -50 cm) observed between two successive irrigations. To assess aeration and water retention capacity, total porosity; airspace; and easily, and nonavailable water, as well as the bulk density of the substrates, were determined and concomitantly compared with the ideal substrates determined by De Boodt and Verdonck. The comparative results showed that substrate porosity alone is not efficient to create ideal plant growth conditions, but dynamic parameters are also needed. Plants grown in a substrate classified as nonideal showed significantly greater growth than the plants grown in most of the other substrates studied.

AB The commercially available parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is an effective biocontrol agent for slugs and particularly Deroceras reticulatum, a widespread pest species. Use of the nematode is currently limited by cost and it may be that by developing a fuller understanding of the ecology and behaviour of this nematode, more cost effective application strategies can be developed. We investigated the ability of two strains of P. hermaphrodita (one newly isolated and one that had been maintained in vitro for >15 years) to move through mineral soils and organic media. Active dispersal of both strains was found to be greatest in organic media (bark chips and leaf litter, and to a lesser extent peat) and the nematode was capable of growth and reproduction in leaf litter. Conversely, active dispersal was poor in mineral soils. Nematodes moved further in a clay loam compared with a sandy loam, and moved more at a bulk density of 1.0 vs. 1.2 Mg m(-3). However. P. hermaphrodita was capable of moving greater distances in mineral soils by using the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris as a phoretic host. Our data suggest that P. hermaphrodita is a facultative parasite that is adapted to living in leaf litter and organic material where slugs frequently rest. The implications of these findings for using the nematode as a biological control agent for slugs are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two Lithuanian c. 50-cm long peat cores from ombrotrophic bogs were analysed, namely, Rekyva near Siauliai and Zudiskes near Vilnius. Ash content, bulk density, chemical element concentrations determined by EDXRF and Pb-210 dating by gamma spectrometric methods were used. Geochemical data of deep Rekyva peatland mine layers, dated by C-14 to the BC/AD boundary, enable the estimation of reference values for the calculation of increase coefficients (IC) in the young (formed after 1900) layers of cores, where IC values exceed 26.3 for Pb, 2.9 for Zn, 2.4 for Cu and 2.3 for Ni. The young layers compared to the older ones are characterized by an increase of ash and most elemental contents and the disappearance of a positive correlation between ash and Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni contents. Higher median values of IC and the anthropogenic accumulation rate (AR) in young Rekyva are predetermined mainly by soil dust, higher median enrichment factors (EF) of Zn, Cu, Ni and median percentages of their anthropogenic component by higher industrialization of Vilnius and the leeward location of Zudiskes. The timing of maximum or next high EF and anthropogenic AR (mg m(-2) yr(-1)) of Pb (10.1), Zn (7.0), Cu (1.1), Ni (1.2) in Zudiskes (1970-1974) corresponds to general results over Europe.

AB Potential utilization of synthetic aggregates (SAs) developed from sewage sludge (SS) as a component of containerized media for French marigold (Tagetes patula) cultivation as a peat substitution was investigated in this study. The six different containerized media utilized were: peat only, SA 20%: peat 80%, SA 40%: peat 60%, SA 60%: peat 40%, SA 80%: peat 20% and SA only. The physical and chemical characteristics of all media were determined. SA-based media showed higher pH, electrical conductivity (EC), bulk density, particle density and nutrient contents (N, P, Ca and Mg) compared to peat media. The highest plant length, number of flowers per plant, shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root length, root fresh weight and root dry weight obtained from the medium having SA 40%: peat 60% increased by 13.69%, 23.53%, 41.46%, 58.95%, 2.43%, 39.09% and 21.68%, respectively, compared to the peat control. The addition of 60% and 100% of SAs to the growth media gave the lowest growth and yield parameters compared to the peat control due to their high EC and pH. Plant tissues obtained from media with added SAs showed increased N, P, Ca and Mg contents compared to plant tissues obtained from peat media. Media with added SAs did not significantly increase concentrations of Cu, Cd, Cr and Pb in plant tissues but the Zn concentration was significantly increased. SA addition to media did not pose any phytotoxicity risks in French marigold plants. SAs can be suggested as viable potting media components to substitute for the widely used and more expensive peat utilized in horticulture.

AB Coco (Cocos nucifera L.) coir dust is a material used as substrate because of its good capacity for water retention, high content of easily available water, stability as organic substrate and low acquisition cost, compared to other substrates. Nevertheless, salinity and variability are two of the main problems of this media, attributed to the production process and its origin. In the present study seven materials were characterized (five Mexicans and two from Sri Lanka) from companies with different grinding process. physical, chemical and biological characteristics were determined. Physical and chemical properties differed significantly among materials. Corresponding ranges for gross index were 32 to 64 %; for bulk and real density, 0.08 to 0.12 and 1.48 to 1.49 g cm(-3) for air capacity, 11 to 53 %: and for water retention capacity, 50 to 81 %; easily available water, reserve and total available, 18 to 35, 3 to 14 and 21 to 40 %. Total porous space was higher than 92 % in all materials. Regarding chemical characteristics the pH of the substrates were a slightly acid fin (5.1 a 5.6), electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ranged from 1.5 to 4.5 dS m(-1), the concentration of NO3-N, Ca, Mg and micronutrients in the saturation extract was low, NH4-N was found in an optimal range, while K, P, Na y Cl concentrations were markedly high with values from 420 to 1261, 7 to 61, 60 to 226 y 244 to 1700 mg L-1, respectively. Cation exchange capacity values ranged from 39 to 53 cmol(e) kg(-1), whereas the germination index ranged from 30 to 114 %. Physical and chemical characteristics were more affected by variations in particle size properties than by the grinding process.

AB Pine tree substrate (PTS) is a relatively new alternative to the commonly used pine bark and peat-based substrates for container crop production. Physical and chemical properties of freshly manufactured PTS have been studied; however, this new substrate will sometimes be manufactured and stored for later use by growers. The objective of this research was to determine how chemical and physical properties of PTS were affected by storage duration with or without amendments of limestone or peatmoss. We also studied how the growth of marigold was influenced by PTS storage time and by lime and peat amendments. Substrate properties studied were pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N), bulk density (BD), and particle size distribution. Pine tree substrate was manufactured by hammermilling chips of approximate to 15-year-old loblolly pine trees (Pinus taeda L.) through two screen sizes, 4.76 mm (PTS) and 15.9 mm [amended with peat (PTSP)]. Pine tree substrate and PTSP were amended with lime at five rates and a peat-perlite mix (PL) served as a control treatment. Substrates were prepared, placed in plastic storage bags, and stored on shelves in an open shed in Blacksburg, VA. Substrates were subsampled at 1, 42, 84, 168, 270, and 365 days after storage. At each subsampling day, twelve I-L containers were filled with a subsample of each treatment. Six of the 12 were left fallow and six were planted with 14-day-old marigold (Tagetes erecta L. 'Inca Gold') seedlings. Substrate was also collected for analysis of CEC, C:N, BD, and particle size distribution. The pH of non-limed PTS decreased during storage, and at least 1 kg.m(-3) lime was needed to maintain PTS pH 5.4 or greater over the 365-day storage period (Day 1 pH = 5.8) and 2 to 4 kg.m(-3) was needed to maintain PTSP pH 5.4 or greater for 365 days (Day 1 pH = 5.2). EC measurements were highest at Day 1 (1.02 to 1.21 dS-m(-1)) in all treatments and decreased by Day 42. Cation exchange capacity decreased over time in non-limed PTS and PTSP. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and BD remained the same over time for all treatments. There were minor changes in particle size distribution for limed PTS. Marigold growth in all limed PTS and PTSP treatments was equal to or greater than in PL, except at Day 1; the lower growth in PTS and PTSP at Day 1 compared with PL suggests that freshly manufactured PTS may contain a phytotoxic substance that was not present in PTS by Day 42. Pine tree substrate and PTSP are relatively stable when stored as described previously, except for a pH decrease that can be prevented with additions of lime before storage.

AB The interactions of lanthanide ions, REE(III), with semiquinone radicals naturally occurring in humic (HA) and hymatomelanic (HY) acids of different origin were studied mainly by EPR spectroscopy. Quantitative EPR analysis proved that only the semiquinone free radical concentration in both. HA and HY, was affected by interaction with some of the lanthanide ions, whereas the EPR g parameters of the formed radical-REE(III) complexes remained unchanged. The radical concentration was practically unaffected by the REE(III) ions with 4f(1)-4f(6) electron configurations and in some degree increased by REE(III) ions with 4f(8)-4f(14) configuration. The lanthanide playing an exceptional role was Gd(III) (4f(7)), which diminished strongly the free radicals concentration. The quenching ability of Gd(III) was stronger towards the radicals provided by HA than by HY, what was assigned to higher content in HA of both, oxygen-containing functional groups and conjugated aromatic rings, leading to more efficient Gd(III)-radical interaction. The semiquinone free radicals of HA and HY originated from the compost were more reactive than those from peat, as the humic acids from mature compost with less bulk density have more accessible functional groups.

AB Stimulation of floating peat by the introduction of poorly humified peat from four cut-over bogs in The Netherlands was studied in a one-year outdoor experiment. The pH of the various peat substrates was increased by adding different amounts of lime: 0-2 to 4-8 g-CaCO3.kg(-1) fresh peat. Both peat type and lime addition were found to affect the buoyancy of the peat substrates. Low nutrient concentrations in the peat, together with a high bulk density, proved to be unfavourable for creating floating peat. Three of the peat types proved to be too acidic (pH < 4.5) to produce sufficient methane (ca. 400-600 mumol.L-1), and buoyancy was only achieved if lime was mixed in with the peat. The smallest amount of lime added (2 g.kg(-1) fresh peat) was sufficient to maintain buoyancy for at least one year. Lime addition did not stimulate nutrient mobilization by mineralization, although P, N and K concentrations in the peat water were relatively high. It is concluded that floating peat can be initiated by the introduction of poorly humified peat. If the peat substrates are too acidic, lime can be added to stimulate buoyancy of the peat. Results are discussed in relation to restoration prospects.

AB The importance of human impacts on Earth has led to the proposal of a new geologic epoch called the Anthropocene. However markers, recognizable in all records, are required to define this period. Here we combine elemental geochemistry with stable lead (Pb) isotopes and mineralogical analyses to decipher the sources of lead in two exploited ombrotrophic peat bogs (Pulicizna Mala and Puicizna Krauszowska) from Southern Poland. The most disturbed parts of the cores, distinguished using bulk density and age-depth models (22-45 cm in PM and 22-46 cm in PK), were excluded from the interpretation. The two studied cores record ca. 2000 years of variations in lead accumulation rates and isotopic compositions. In the lowest part of the cores (2nd to 4th century AD for Puicizna Mala and 2nd century BC to 2nd century AD for Puilcizna Krauszowska), the Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios (1.188) are consistent with natural supplies from the erosion of the nearby Tatra Mountains. From the 9th to the 19th century AD, Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios (1.176-1.179) are similar to the signatures obtained from Polish galena ores. The highest Pb accumulation rates are found around 1950 AD and reflect the primary influence of bituminous coal combustion together with the secondary influence of leaded gasoline. This result agrees with the occurrence and abundance of spheroidal aluminosilicates, an unambiguous marker of human industrial activity and coal burning as well as with the acceleration of Zn, Cd and Fe accumulation rate. Our results provide evidence that similar geochemical patterns exist in both analysed cores despite differences in the history of peatland exploitation. Therefore, given that extra care is taken to identify the disturbed peat layers, exploited peatlands can be used to record past changes in lead isotopic signature during the Anthropocene.

AB Substrates with vermicompost added promote growth in horticultural crops. Therefore, it is important to know its properties in order to apply proper amounts of it. This work aims to analyze substrate changes according to vermicompost doses and evaluate the effect of the mixtures on lettuce seedling quality. The essay was carried out under greenhouse conditions in Lujan, Argentina (34 degrees 36' S, 59 degrees 04' W). Butterhead lettuce cv. Tizona was sown using substrates with different amounts of vermicompost added and a commercial mix of peat and perlite: 1) 0% vermicompost, 2) 20% vermicompost, 3) 40% vermicompost. The substrates were analyzed physically and chemically. The number of leaves and both fresh and dry weights of leaves, roots and plant were determined. The treatments were established in a complete randomized block design with four replications. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance, while the difference between means was studied by Tukey's Test. Regression analysis was used to study the response of substrate physical and chemical parameters to the addition of vermicompost, ranging from 0 to 40%. The addition of vermicompost resulted in a linear increased in pH, electrical conductivity, nutrient level, bulk density and total porosity of the substrate, while organic matter decreased linearly and quadratically the percentage of pores occupied by water. The plants responded to the addition of vermicompost, with a 20% increase in size.

AB This study analysed the drainage influence on vegetation and peat deposit and assessed the self-restoration of ecological functions of Western Siberia bogs. As a case study, we selected four raised bogs - two are the east-northern spurs of the Great Vasyugan Mire and two are small, raised bogs on the terrace of the Bakchar River and the Ob River. The consequences of drainage and the ability to self-restore are influenced by the moisture conditions before drainage, bog size, distance between ditches and microtopography characteristics. The dominant species under wet conditions, such as Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum balticum, changed with drainage to Sphagnum fuscum, and the peat accumulation rate increased. The sites with more dry conditions and dominated by Sphagnum fuscum were characterised by the intense degradation of Sphagnum, Bryidae and lichen growth and a low peat accumulation rate. Large raised bogs are relatively stable and capable of self-restoration. The drainage effect was more significant within some parts of the small bogs. Drainage consequences were less dramatic for large bogs, even in the marginal parts and near the ditches. A distance between ditches of 40 m and less is critical for self-restoration. Our study demonstrates that modern peat accumulation occurred in most parts of the plots; the mean peat accumulation rate over the last 35 years was 0.43 cm per year. Drainage influence in the south-eastern part of Western Siberia is less significant than in European bogs, not only because of the high stability of raised bogs but also because of the lower drainage intensity as well as the absence of forest planting, fertilisation and peat mining.

AB We undertook a survey of the vegetational ecology of 94 peatlands at Duck Mountain, Manitoba to discriminate differences among peatland types at the southeastern edge of the boreal plain, especially black spruce swamps, and to clarify boreal swamp terminology. The majority of peatlands surveyed were wooded, relatively small (mean = 1.8 ha), and in depressions on the landscape. A classification and indicator species analysis identified the dominant peatland types as moderate-rich fens, with bogs and extreme-rich fens as rare. Black spruce swamps were relatively common and often found on gentle slopes. They were distinguished from wooded fens by larger trees (mean height = 9.7 m; diameter = 12.6 cm), denser overstory (68%), shallower peat depth (90 cm), and small size (1.6 ha). Although most similar to wooded moderate-rich fens by vegetation, black spruce swamps have a denser bryophyte layer and more mesic plant species. Significant indicator species on hummocks and drier areas include Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens, Equisetum sylvaticum, Petasites frigidus var. palmatus, Comus canadensis, Linnaea borealis, Rosa acicularis, Moneses uniflora, Geocaulon lividum, Orthillia secunda, Equisetum arvense, Listera cordata, and Mertensia paniculata. Species characteristically found in black spruce swamp hollows include Rhizomnium pseudopunctatum, Rhizomnium gracile, and Plagiochila porelloides. We discuss conifer swamp terminology globally, and recommend that black spruce swamps be recognized as a peatland type distinct from eastern white cedar-dominated boreal swamps found in the eastern boreal region, wooded fens, and black spruce-dominated uplands. The environmental gradients most strongly associated with an ordination of the Duck Mountain peatland plant community data were forest mensuration variables, e.g., overstory density (range = 7-80%), peat depth (0.4-+3.0 m), peat C:N (14-67), organic C (54-98%), bulk density (0.19-64.00 g/cc), surface-water temperature (3.0-19.5 degrees C), specific conductivity (0-989 mu S/cm), and Ca2+ (1.8-111.4 mg/L). Wooded bogs were distinguished from the other peatland types based on mean pH (3.8), alkalinity (0.2 mg/L), Ca2+ (5.0 mg/L) and other cations, but there was much overlap among the fens and black spruce swamp. A number of isolated, topographically high, open peatlands were characterized by plant species with affinities to open moderate-rich fens, including Drepanocladus aduncus, Helodium blandowii, Salix discolor, Equisetum fluviatile, and Calamagrostis canadensis, but mean surface water pH (5.4), Ca2+ (13 mg/L), DOC (47 mg/L), and NH4+ (188 mu g/L) were more similar to wooded bogs. This may be the consequence of fluctuating water levels. The potential impact of climate change, in addition to current impacts from logging, emphasizes the importance of understanding the vegetation and environmental variables in southern boreal peatlands.

AB Post-bog soils developed from limnic calcareous sediments are closely related to a young-glacial landscape and postglacial lakes in Northern Poland. The studies conducted in 2010-2012 on post-bog soils near lake Dubie (Rownina Drawska, NW Poland), partially used as an arable land. The goal of research was to characterise some chemical and physical properties of post-bog soils developed from carbonate deposits near lake Dubie. The soils of the analysed area developed from lacustrine chalk and calcareous gyttja belong to black earth and mucky soils. Organic matter content in surface horizons ranged from 5.0 to14.2%, content of CaCO3 from 27.2 to 55.2%, the highest carbonate content was found in arable soil. The soils of the study area were characterised by a narrow C/N ratio, low level of total form of P and a high content of Ca. Specific density of surface horizons was in the range 2.49 to 2.58 Mg.m(-3), bulk density from 0.445 to 1.212 Mg.m(-3). High porosity was also found in the examined formations, from 0.826 in surface horizons and 0.700 m(3).m(-3) in limnic deposits.

AB Boreal peatlands in Canada comprise a substantial store of soil organic carbon (peat), and this peat is vulnerable to extensive burning during periods of extended drying. Increased frequency of extreme weather events in boreal regions is expected with future climate change, and the conditions that would support sustained smouldering peat combustion within peatlands may be more common. Organic soils tend to burn by smouldering combustion, a very slow-moving process in fuels such as those found in peatlands. Thus the most extreme conditions for carbon loss to the atmosphere due to the burning of peat likely occur when widespread propagation of flaming combustion leads to widespread initiation of smouldering. To investigate the potential for large-scale, high-intensity fire spread across forested bogs, we examined the fuel conditions in forested bogs necessary to support active crown fire. We measured surface and canopy fine fuels (those available to contribute to the propagating energy flux of the main flaming front) across a postfire chronosequence of forested boreal bog from central Alberta, Canada. We found that fuel load of fine surface material remained relatively constant across the chronosequence and at levels large enough to support crown fire initiation. Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) regeneration begins to fill in the crown space with increasing time since disturbance and achieves crown bulk densities similar to black spruce upland forests. We estimated that after about 80 years, the black spruce canopy has developed enough available fuel to support active crown fire on between 10% to 40% of days in a typical fire season in central Alberta, Canada. Broad-scale propagation of high-intensity fire across a peatland when coincident with drought-induced lower moisture in deep peatland layers has the potential to lead to a substantial release of stored terrestrial carbon.

AB In this study, palaeoenvironmental changes recorded in the top metre of a peat profile (Misten bog, East Belgium) were investigated using a multiproxy approach. Proxies include bulk density, Ti and Si content, pollen, macrofossils, delta C-13 on specific Sphagnum stems, and delta C-13-delta O-18 on Sphagnum leaves. A high-resolution chronology was generated using Pb-210 measurements and 22 C-14 AMS dates on carefully selected Sphagnum macrofossils. delta C-13 only records large change in mire surface wetness. This is partly due to the fact that the core was taken from the edge of a hummock, which may make it difficult to track small isotopic changes. The delta C-13 signal seems to be dependent upon the Sphagnum species composition. For example, a change between Sphagnum section Cuspidata towards Sphagnum imbricatum causes a significant drop in the delta C-13 values. On the whole, the C and O isotopes record two shallow pool phases during the 8th-9th and the 13th centuries. Pollen and atmospheric soil dust (ASD) fluxes records increased human occupation in the area. There may be some climatic signals in the ASD flux, but they are difficult to decipher from the increasing human impact (land clearance, agriculture) during the last millennium. The variations in the proxies are not always synchronous, suggesting different triggering factors (temperature, wetness, windiness) for each proxy. This study also emphasizes that, compared to studies dealing with pollution using geochemical proxies, palaeoclimatic inferences from peat bogs need as many proxies as possible, together with highly accurate and precise age-models, in order to better understand climate variability and their consequences during the Holocene.

AB Mangroves experience stress or mortality when gas exchange by aerial root structures is hindered by sediment burial or constant inundation. The resulting loss of belowground roots and increased decomposition can lead to a loss of surface elevation through peat collapse, furthering the degree of inundation. This study identified ten live mangrove forests across Tampa Bay (Florida, USA) with stagnant water and/or abundant adventitious root growth (a sign of stress) and compared vegetative, water, and soil characteristics of stressed and reference mangrove forests to identify early indicators of stress and potential peat collapse. Two stressed sites were characterized by sandy, high-density soils and were hypothesized to have been stressed by a burial event. The remaining eight stressed locations had stagnant pools of discolored water with low dissolved oxygen (1.1 +/- 1.3 mg L-1). Soil from the hydrologic stress sites had significantly lower dry bulk density than reference mangrove sites (0.24 +/- 0.14 g cm(-3) vs. 0.40 +/- 0.11 g cm(-3)), greater organic matter composition (49.3 +/- 17.2% vs. 26.1 +/- 9.0%), and a higher proportion of root material. Salinity and porewater dissolved organic carbon varied widely but were not significantly different between reference and hydrologic stress sites. Altered hydrology due to anthropogenic alteration can often be improved; thus, proactive restoration is recommended to prevent mortality and peat collapse in affected mangrove forests.

AB Peat cores from Wylde Lake Bog in temperate southern Ontario, Canada, were examined to determine factors affecting Holocene ecological change and long-term rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA). By 10,250 cal. BP, a marsh was established, characterized by sediments with higher bulk density, highly decomposed material in the macrofossil record, and lower LORCA. By 8100 cal. BP, the marsh was replaced by a peat-accumulating fen dominated by herbaceous taxa and non-Sphagnum mosses. Around 4000 cal. BP, transition to a Sphagnum-dominated bog took place. These directional changes suggest a strong role for autogenesis, although periodic fluctuations in macrofossil assemblages and in LORCA suggest an important secondary role for climatic change and disturbance in explaining Holocene changes. LORCA remained fairly stable through the fen and bog zones, similar to 18 g C/m(2)/yr. In the high-resolution record spanning the most recent 1800 years, relatively higher values for LORCA and macrofossils associated with wetter conditions were recorded around 1400 cal. BP, partially coincident with the 'Medieval Climate Anomaly'. LORCA decreases to minimum values for the record during part of the 'Little Ice Age' as woody macrofossils increase, suggesting a drier peat surface. The most recent portion of the record shows significant changes in LORCA and in bog vegetation associated with anthropogenic land clearance and damming. The charcoal record suggests that fire did not play an important role in peatland dynamics in the pre-industrial Holocene; however, a major anthropogenic fire in ad 1870 significantly altered the peatland, affecting surface vegetation heterogeneously.

TI Modified Technique for Measuring Unsaturated Hydraulic Conductivity in
   Sphagnum Moss and Peat
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PORE-SIZE; RESTORATION; DYNAMICS
AB Highly compressible soil, such as Sphagnum moss and peat, undergo volume change with varying volumetric soil water content (theta) and pressures (psi), so typical methods for determining unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-unsat) in non-compressible mineral soils can be problematic. However, characterizing these relationships are essential for modeling ecohydrological processes. Two methods have been developed for determining K-unsat of these highly compressible soils using "floating" tension disks; the original method imposes a y gradient across a sample, while a modified method imposes no y gradient and flow is driven by gravity. However, it is unknown if they produce comparable results. Milled horticultural peat was compressed (n = 34) to a bulk density of 0.19 +/- 0.01 g cm(-3) and K-unsat and q were measured for each sample at variable psi-steps (-5, -10, -15, and -25 cm) for both methods. In the modified method average q was found to be lower (p < 0.001, df = 19) at psi-steps -10 and -15 cm, while average K-unsat was lower (p < 0.001, W = 210) at all psi-steps. Numerical modeling (Hydrus-1D) of each psi-step identified nonlinear distributions of theta, psi, and K-unsat within a sample in the original method (verified with tensiometer measurements), whereas a uniform distribution of these parameters was observed in the modified method. We conclude the modified method produces a more precise measurement of the K(psi) function. Although these methods were developed for Sphagnum moss and peat soils, the method can likely be used for other compressible or delicate media.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE

   PROFILES; EXCHANGE; EUROPE; FEN; CH4
AB Peatlands are common in many parts of the world. Draining and other changes in the use of peatlands increase atmospheric CO2 concentration. If we are to make reliable quantitative predictions of that effect, we need good information on the CO2 emission rates from peatlands. The present study uses two different methods for predicting CO2-C release of peatland soils: (i) a 40-year field investigation of balancing organic carbon stocks and (ii) short-term CO2-C release rates from laboratory experiments. To estimate long-term losses of peat, and its resulting C input to the atmosphere, we combined highly detailed maps of surface topography and its changes, and the organic C contents and bulk densities of a drained peatland from different years. Short-term CO2-C release rates were measured in the laboratory by incubating soil samples from several soil horizons at various temperatures and soil moistures. We then derived nonlinear CO2-C production functions, which we incorporated into a numerical simulation model (HYDRUS). Using HYDRUS, we calculated daily soil water components and CO2-release for (i) real-climate data from 1950 to 2003 and (ii) a climate scenario extending to 2050, including an increase in temperature of 2 degrees C and 20% less rainfall during the summer half year, i.e. from April to September inclusive. From our field measurements, we found a mean annual decrease of 0.7 cm in the thickness of the peat. Large losses (> 1.5 cm year(-1)) occurred only during periods when groundwater levels were low (i.e. a deep water-table). The annual CO2-C release results in a mean loss from the peat of about 700 g CO2-C m(-2), mostly as a direct contribution to the atmosphere. Both methods produced very similar results. The model scenarios demonstrated that CO2-C loss is mainly controlled by the groundwater (i.e. water-table) depth, which controls subsurface aeration. A local climate scenario estimated a c. 5% increase of CO2-C losses within the next 50 years.

AB Global land-use intensification and drainage has altered the biogeochemical properties of many peatlands, and concomitant eutrophication has led to a loss of low-competitive fen species. We investigated the hypothesis that removal of a degraded and eutrophied top peat layer, thereby exposing an underlying peat layer, can improve conditions for rich fen restoration. We studied the long-term (3-18 years) effects of past topsoil removal in six rich fens in Western Europe by comparing topsoil removal plots with (untouched) control plots. Overall, topsoil removal plots were characterized by lower bulk densities and soil nutrient pools of P and KCl-extractable NH4+, while organic matter contents and soil C:N ratios were higher. Pore water concentrations of NO3 and NH4+ also decreased in the topsoil removal plots, while concentrations of base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) and HCO3 increased. Furthermore, lower nutrient levels appeared to restrict herb biomass production in the topsoil removal plots, so that optimized light conditions led to the establishment of light-demanding target species and a significant increase in bryophyte cover. Multivariate analysis revealed that most variation in vegetation assembly was due to higher groundwater levels in the topsoil removal plots, closely followed by a higher relative light intensity (RLI) at surface level, lower porewater nutrient (NH4+) concentrations, and higher concentrations of base cations. We conclude that topsoil removal can be an effective mechanism to "reset" a degraded peatland to its initial state of nutrient limitation, base saturation and high availability of light, thereby improving the conservation prospects of endangered rich fen communities.

AB Sites (n = 119) on drained mires located in the southern aapa mire zone in Finland were analysed by multivariate techniques. The compositional trends of the understorey vegetation were analysed by means of hybrid multidimensional scaling (HMDS). In addition to field classification, two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and flexible unweighted paired group arithmetic average (FUPGMA) classifications were used.
   The 1st HMDS dimension primarily reflected variation along a gradient from spruce mire influence to hummock-level bog influence. Variation in nutrient status was also connected to this gradient. Factors underlying the 2nd dimension were variation in nutrient status and drainage succession (moisture). Some sample plots representing herb-rich or Molinia-rich types were separated along the 3rd dimension. The variation in understorey vegetation (i.e. the ordination space) showed high maximum correlation with stand volume r = 0.81, mean annual stand volume increment r = 0.76, and post-drainage dominant height r = 0.75. The covariation between the vegetation and peat bulk density in both the 0-10 and 10-20 cm peat layers was also strong: r = 0.55 and r = 0.80. The correlations for H-vpost were 0.64 and 0.81, respectively. Of the total macronutrient concentrations, phosphorus (r = 0.73, r = 0.75) and nitrogen (r = 0.59, r = 0.64) were the most strongly correlated with species composition. The environmental sample variables were also presented by the vegetation units of numerical classification. Most of the recorded variables, including nutrient amounts (kg ha(-1)), were examined in site quality (fertility) classes by succession phases as well. Border variants or transitional forms of the site types were common. Additional vegetation criteria (e.g. surface-water influence) more closely defined the ecology of the site. In addition to the site quality classes, a considerable amount of information about the tree stands, vegetation diversity and peat properties was associated with the separation of the succession phases, i.e. in this study transforming (phase II) vs. transformed (final phase III) sites. In conclusion, the actual vegetation appeared to well reflect various aspects of the ecological conditions, even in labile communities of commercial forests on drained peatlands.

AB Peatlands occupy about 4% of Poland's area and perform important environmental and economic functions, including agricultural ones. In the last century, the majority of fen peatlands were drained for agricultural use. Drainage reduced the water retention of peat and initiated changes in their physical and water properties. In order to determine the rate and extent of changes in these properties, in the following years 1987, 2007 and 2018, studies were carried out within the Suprasl Dolna fen peatland, NE Poland, in two prognostic soil-moisture complexes: moist (PSMC-B) and dry (PSMC-C). Studies have shown that in the PSMC-B complex, the water table depth decreased to a maximum of 100 cm below ground level, while on the PSMC-C complex, the ground water decreased even to 150 cm below ground level. In the PSMC-B complex, peat mineralisation and physical-water properties changed to a small extent during the research period (statistically insignificant). In the PSMC-C habitat, the subsidence of peatland surface was observed (11 cm), bulk density increased, whereas the total porosity and full water capacity decreased. Deterioration in physical and water properties caused gradual degradation of drained fen peatland soils and their evolution towards organo-mineral soils. In order to slow down or even stop degradation processes in shallow and medium deep peat-mursh soils, there is a need to stop and regulate the outflow of water using efficient drainage facilities, as well as to carry out technical restoration works.

SO COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION

DT Article
AB Ammonium sulfate or urea were added as N-source to shredded straw of Miscanthus ogiformis 'Giganteus' and water was included as control. The combined materials were composted for seven months, and the resulting composts were tested as growth substrates for nursery container plants and compared with fertilized and unfertilized peat substrates. The pH was below recommended level for the Compost substrate made with ammonium sulfate and for the unfertilized peat substrate throughout the experiment. Electrical conductivity and concentrations of most nutrients were low and decreased throughout the experiment for all growth substrates. Shrinking of the growth substrates after 4, 12 or 17 months was larger for compost substrates than for peat substrates. Bulk density increased in compost substrates and decreased in peat substrates, while the total loss of C was greater in compost substrates than in peat. Water retention was lower and air volume greater for compost substrate made with ammonium sulfate than for fertilized peat. Algae and mosses did not occur on Miscanthus compost growth substrates in contrast to peat substrates. The shoot length and dry matter of Hedera helix, produced after four and 12 months of growth, and five months following cut back, showed that plants can grow well in compost substrates made of Miscanthus straw and ammonium sulfate or urea. However, the compost substrates could not fully substitute for fertilized or unfertilized peat substrate with respect to dry matter production.

Additionally, plants were grown in a 50 peat : 30 perlite : 20 loam (by volume) control substrate. Shredded rubber-containing substrates had higher bulk densities, lower total pore space, and higher total solids than the control substrate, Fine rubber-containing substrates had lower air-filled pore space (AFP) and lower water-holding capacities (WHC) than the control substrate. Substrates containing 25% coarse rubber had lower AFP and WHC than the control, but substrates containing 50% and 75% coarse shredded rubber had higher AFP and lower WHC than the control, Shredded rubber-containing substrates had significantly higher levels of Zn than the control substrate, Plants grown in rubber-containing substrates had tissue Zn levels significantly higher than the control and at levels reported to be phytotoxic in other species. Geraniums grown in rubber-containing substrates had lower root and shoot fresh mass, were shorter, and had fewer axillary branches than those grown in the control substrate. Poinsettia plants grown in rubber-containing substrates were shorter, had lower shoot fresh mass, fewer bracts, and lower bract area as compared to plants grown in the control substrate.

AB This study assesses the potential for composted bamboo residues to serve as a renewable replacement for peat in horticultural growing media. Bamboo residues and wheat bran compost (ratio 90:10) were prepared in two batches, with (B1) and without (B2) effective microorganisms, and mixed with peat at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% by volume. Both batches were then used in greenhouse tests with two horticultural plants, Osmanthus fragrans (Thunb.) Lour. and Hydrangea macrophylla (Thunb.) Ser., using pure peat as a control. Batch B1 showed higher peak temperature and longer thermophilic phase than B2 during composting, and had higher N but lower total C and C/N ratio than B2. The addition of either batch to the growth media increased bulk density, particle density, and air space compared with pure peat, but decreased total pore space and total water-holding capacity. At lower compost content, the physical and chemical properties of the test batches were very similar to those of an ideal substrate, especially those mixed with B1. Plants grown in media mixed with B1 (25% or 50%) or B2 (25%) showed no significant differences in growth rates for height and ground diameter compared to those of the pure peat control. The results suggest that using effective microorganisms can increase mineralization during composting of bamboo residues, and that composted bamboo residues should be considered as a component of horticultural growth media in partial substitution for costly and less sustainable peat.

ID CREEPING BENTGRASS; ZEOLITE
AB Physical and chemical properties of root zone mixes and methods of green construction are important considerations for improving turf-grass quality for putting greens. This study compared 'Penncross' creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.) performance as affected by three root zone construction systems with three amendments (sand, peat, and zeolite). The objective of this study was to determine if an amended California construction system would improve green performance during establishment (1998-1999) and maturation (20002001). Three treatments is-ere tested: California (100% sand), USGA (90% sand and 10% peat, v/v), and California-Z (85% sand and 15% zeolite, v/v). Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block with four replicates. Physical and chemical properties of the root zone and bentgrass performance were compared for the treatments. The California-Z treatment had the highest saturated hydraulic conductivity and field infiltration rate and the lowest bulk density. It also had the highest cation exchange capacity and plant available nutrient concentrations among the three treatments. The California-Z treatment produced bentgrass quality and color during green establishment and maturation that were equal to or higher than the California treatment and consistently higher than the USGA treatment. The addition of an inorganic amendment to the California system improved physical and chemical properties of the root zone and improved quality and color of bentgrass during green establishment. During green maturation, creeping bentgrass in the California-Z treatment was equal (6 of 15 sampling dates) or 20% higher (9 of 15 dates) in quality compared with the California system.

ID SOLID-WASTE COMPOST; GROWING MEDIUM; MEDIA
AB Container technology can effectively control soil environment and nutrient status to obtain the optimal plant growth condition. Peat, green waste compost (GWC), soil and perlite were used as substrate materials to study the effects of different substrate ratios on growth and physiology of 1.5-year-old Sequoia sempervirens container seedlings. The optimal substrate ratio of S. sempervirens container seedlings was obtained by L-9 (3(4)) orthogonal design and was finally evaluated by principal component analysis. The volume ratio of peat: GWC: soil: perlite of 4: 1.5: 1: 2 was the best substrate ratio for S. sempervirens across all parameters, whose porosity, bulk density (BD) and gas-water ratio (GWR) were within the ideal ranges. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) of 1.40% and total phosphorus (TP) of 0.13% were the highest among the nine different substrates. The total potassium (TK) and electrical conductivity (EC) were 0.13% and 0.70 ms cm(-1), respectively. In addition, the plant height and ground diameter growing in the substrate were increased by 28% and 39% compared to their respective initial values. The content of peat and GCW had significant effects on growth (p < 0.01). The GWR in T2 (peat: GWC: soil: perlite = 6: 1: 0.5: 2) and T6 (peat: GWC: soil: perlite = 4: 0.5: 0.5: 1) are not suitable for S. sempervirens container seedlings. The PCA ranking of the 9 groups of substrates is: T8 > T1 > T4 > T3 > T2 > T5 > T7 > T9 > T6. The combination of peat, GWC, soil and perlite in an appropriate ratio could provide a good environment for S. sempervirens container seedlings.

AB The Florida Everglades wetland ecosystem is subject to changes in hydroperiod and nutrient loading, resulting in soil P enrichment and changes in vegetation communities. The objectives of this study were to: (i) quantify the forms of inorganic and organic P in soils from four hydrologic units of the Everglades, and (ii) develop empirical relationships among various soil P forms. Soil samples from selected hydrologic units, including the Water Conservation Areas (WCAs) and the Holey Land Wildlife Management Area (HWMA), were obtained at various locations along transects perpendicular to each nutrient input source, while selected field sites were sampled in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), Spatial distribution of total P in the surface 0- to 10-cm soil depth showed ed distinct gradients in the WCAs and HWMA soils, with high total P in soils closer to sources (canals and inflow structures) than in interior, unimpacted areas. Soil ash content and bulk density were also altered as a result of soil subsidence (for EAA soils), hydrology, and nutrient loading (for the WCAs and the HWMA soils). Influence of P loading was primarily confined to the top 30-cm soil depth, with about one-third of the P stored in the inorganic pool (primarily as Ca- and Mg-bound P), and the remainder present as organic P, Inorganic P content was higher in surface soils and decreased with depth. Soil P enrichment indicated that for approximately 5 km from the inflow structures or canals, soils have been impacted by nutrient loading. Empirical relationships developed in this study should be useful for estimating soil P forms at the landscape level, using total P data available for a large number of sites throughout the Everglades region.

AB Data scarcity often prevents the estimate of regional (or national) scale soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and its spatial distribution. This study attempts to overcome the data limitations by combining two existing Irish soil databases [SoilC and national soil database (NSD)] at the national scale, to create an improved estimate of the national SOC stock. Representative regression models between the near-surface SOC concentration and those of deeper depths, and between SOC concentration and bulk density (BD) were developed based on the SoilC database. These regression models were then applied to the NSD derived SOC concentration map, resulting in an improved SOC stock and spatial distribution map for the top 10 cm, 30 cm and 50 cm depths. Western Ireland, particularly coastal areas, was found to have higher SOC densities than eastern Ireland, corresponding to the spatial distribution of peatland. We estimated the national SOC stock at 383 +/- 38 Tg for the near-surface of 0-10 cm depth; 1016 +/- 118 Tg for 0-30 cm depth; and 1474 +/- 181 Tg for 0-50 cm depth.

AB Hydrology controls the physical, chemical and biological processes in peatlands and hence could be the most important process regulating their function, development and characteristic biogeochemistry. Models describing hydrological processes and soil heat exchange phenomena are an important tool in understanding the peatland biogeochemical cycles of C and N. Presented in this paper is a peat soil climate model that uses weather data, mire site and peat characteristics as input data. The model is related to the heterogeneous peat characteristics (e.g. bulk density, degree of humification, remains of Sphagnum, Carex, Eriophorum and woody tissues), which in turn vary with depth. Evapotranspiration is related to weather parameters and tree stand characteristics. The model simulations were validated against the observed data collected during 1993 and 1994 growing seasons at a fen and bog sites at the Lakkasuo mire complex located in central Finland. The observed and simulated day-to-day variations in water table levels and soil temperatures during both seasons appeared overall to be in phase. As the model lacks the data needed to characterize the peat matrix hysteresis, the model was found lacking in response to wetting and drying cycles. The mean differences between simulated and observed water table levels during 1994 were -0.3 +/- 1.3 and -0.5 +/- 2.3 cm for the fen and bog sites, respectively. The model was found to be sensitive to mire surface characteristics and evapotranspiration, particularly for the bog site with an unsaturated zone deeper than at the fen. The absolute mean differences between the simulated and measured peat temperatures from 5 to 150 cm, were less than 1.0 degrees C with a maximal standard deviation of 1.6 degrees C. The model deviations for the upper layers showed larger variations compared to deeper layers, implying a greater accuracy in defining the lower boundary of the thermal regime within the peat column.

AB To characterize dust deposition in southern South America for the Holocene, a 542 cm long core from a peat bog in southern Chile (Oreste bog. Isla Navarino) was studied. Peat formation started similar to 11 160 C-14 yr before present (BP). The titanium (Ti) concentration in bulk peat, combined with dry bulk density, and peat accumulation rate, were used to calculate the mineral accumulation rate (MAR) in the Oreste bog. The distribution of calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn) and titanium (Ti) showed that mineral accumulation for the last c. 6000 yr was predominantly atmospheric with a record of effectively constant deposition (0.43 +/- 0.12g/m(2) per yr). Similarly, Ti and zirconium (Zr) concentrations in the acid insoluble ash (AIA) were also effectively constant and agreed well with the MAR for the last six millennia, except at c. 4200 cal. yr BP, where Zr was enriched relative to Ti. Here, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs A showed that the AIA was dominated by volcanic particles (> 20-40 mu m), with the Mt Burney eruption identified as the most likely source. In contrast with this anomalous zone, SEM studies showed that the mineral particles found in the majority of the sample were predominantly fine grained (< 20 ton) and rounded. Derived from surficial sediment and supplied by long-range atmospheric transport, they reflect the climate stability for the past 6000yr.

AB Green roofs have the potential to be used as a pollutant-sink in urban environments. Unfortunately, until now no systematic study has been conducted to enhance the runoff quality from green roofs. The present work investigates the viability of using low-cost aggregates along with a biosorbent (Sargassum biomass) to prepare substrate mix for extensive green roofs to improve runoff quality. We have used (on a volume basis) 30% perlite, 20% vermiculite, 10% sand, 20% crushed brick, 10% coco-peat and 10% Sargassum biomass to prepare green roof substrate. The developed green roof substrate was found to have low bulk density (487 kg/m(3)), high water retention capacity (58.5%), air filled porosity (19.5%), and hydraulic conductivity (4195 mm/h). Through laboratory packed column study, we identified superior sorption capacity of green roof substrate towards various metal ions such as Al, Fe, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb. Roof-top experiments in pilot-scale green roof assemblies with Portulaca grandiflora as vegetation were conducted for several artificial rain events (unspiked and metal-spiked). Results based on unspiked artificial rain events suggested that concentrations of most of the chemical components in runoff were highest during the beginning of rain events and thereafter subsided during the subsequent rain events. Metal-spiked artificial rain events revealed that green roofs acted as a sink for various metal ions and generated better runoff, whose quality was significantly less than freshwater standards. Green roofs also showed the potential to neutralize the acidic nature of inlet water and delay runoff generation. Significant differences were also observed between non-vegetated and vegetated green roof assemblies in runoff quality and quantity, with the latter producing better results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In situ measurements of soil thermal properties are frequently required when studying coupled heat and water transfer in soils. While these values are widely available for mineral soils, but not for organic-rich peat soils. This study aimed at measuring the thermal properties of six peat:mineral mixtures collected from an oil sands mine reclamation study site using a dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) method. The soil mixes were tested across a range of water contents (theta) and bulk densities (rho). Generally, compared with the thermal conductivity (lambda) of sand soil, lambda of peat soil subsequently decreased with increasing peat:mineral ratios and increased slightly with the increase of theta, indicating the significant impact of organic matter. Similar to lambda, the heat capacity (C) decreased with the increase in soil organic matter content, and the decrease in theta and rho, but differences were relatively small between the different soil mixtures. With increasing theta, lambda increased exponentially, but C increased linearly. At all temperatures but between - 2 degrees C and 0 degrees C for sandy soils and - 4 degrees C and 0 degrees C for peat soils due to ice melting, the de Vries thermal conductivity model described the measurements very well and the DPHP method is suitable to measure the real soil thermal properties. The measured thermal properties for the peat soil can be used in modeling heat conduction in a high latitude cold area, and is a prerequisite for designing peat soil cover in reclamation soil.

AB A 1.8 m long core was retreated from Baijianghe mire in the west flank of Changbai Mountains of China in 2016. The peat sequence was dated by AMS C-14 and Pb-210/Cs-137 methods, showing a 1600-y depositional history. Based on the measured porosity, dry bulk density (DBD), TOC%, absorbance and plant macrofossil, we discuss the mire development and environmental change during the last 1600 years. The basin of Baijianghe Mire was a water-logged bottomland between 330 and 660 CE. A strong drought occurred during 530-600 CE caused lowering of water table which provided hydrological condition to form a peatland. We climate during 660-800 CE led to enhanced primary productivity and accumulation of plant remains, resulting rapidly development of the mire. Warm but fluctuating wetness conditions during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, 900-1150 CE) in the study area kept moderate development of the mire. Baijianghe Mire had the fastest development during 1200-1370 CE under relatively wetter and probably warm conditions. Low carbon accumulation of the mire appeared during the Lithe Ice Age (LIA, 1500-1850 CE) under cold and dry climates. From 1850 CE to 1945 CE, the climate turned to warm and wet. However, the peatland had experienced strong influence by human activity since 1945 CE. The peatland has gradually recovered from artificial drain since 1990s.

AB The present research was conducted to explore the impact of alternative organic amendments on physicochemical properties of soil and their critical value for kiwi seedlings growth. The experiment was laid out in completely randomized design with 3 replications and 20 seedlings per replication. The highest pH (8.0) was recorded in T3 (compost + silt) and the highest electrical conductivity (EC) of 5.91 dS/m, organic matter (24.11%), organic carbon (13.99%), organic nitrogen (1.51%) were recorded in T8 (compost + peat moss (PM) + leaf manure) and the highest soil porosity (SP) (45.95%) and lowest bulk density (0.67) were recorded in T4 (PM + garden soil (GS)). EC higher than 1.99 and SP (45.95%) were found critical and adversely affected seedling survival. The highest plant height (103 and 93 cm), number of leaves (23 and 20), number of first-order lateral roots (NFLRM) (9 and 8.5), whole seedling fresh mass (75 and 72 g), fresh root mass (FRM) (35 and 35 g), shoot fresh mass (46 and 40 g), root collar diameter (RCD) (13 and 12 mm), and shoot diameter (10 and 9 mm) were recorded in T5 (compost + GS) and T7 (compost + PM + GS). Strong and positive correlations were observed among NFLRP, RFM, and RCD (R-2 = 0.89 and 0.96) and all the above-ground seedling traits (R-2 = 0.86-0.98). It is concluded that compost is a good soil amendment for producing good quality graftable kiwi seedlings and evaluation of seedling root system architecture could be used to predict the potential and success of seedlings in the field.

AB Here, we present results of Holocene carbon accumulation from seven new peat cores at four fen sites from Alberta, western Canada. Along with two other published fen records in the same region, we provide a regional synthesis of carbon accumulation patterns, as well as peat property data in this continental climate. On the basis of >3000 peat sample measurements at 1-cm intervals, organic matter content in peat samples is on average at 91.0% (+/- 9.3% in SD) and ash-free bulk density at 0.141 g/cm(3) (+/- 0.045 g/cm(3) in SD) with a range of 0.018-0.381 g/cm(3). On the basis of 109 radiocarbon age determinations from these cores, the overall mean carbon accumulation rate at these fens since 9 kyr (1 kyr = 1000 cal. yr BP) is 32.5 g C/m(2)/yr, which is much higher than the northern peatland average of 18.6-22.9 g C/m(2)/yr from large-scale syntheses. The 'instantaneous' apparent carbon accumulation rates from all these individual measurements at mostly 1-cm intervals are highly variable throughout the Holocene, ranging from 6 to 504 g C/m(2)/yr. The carbon accumulation rates appear to show peak values at 8.3, 6.8, 5.3, 3.8, 2.7, and 1.1 kyr, suggesting a similar to 1500-year periodicity in carbon accumulation, possibly in response to Holocene climate change. Furthermore, carbon accumulation shows a gradual declining trend from 7 to 2 kyr, reaching a minimum at 2 kyr, likely in response to neoglacial climate cooling during the later part of the Holocene in the high-latitude regions. Overall, these fens accumulated and store on average 264 kg C/m(2) during the Holocene, among the highest soil carbon storage reported from terrestrial ecosystems. Our results, along with previous global and regional syntheses, suggest that in contrast to conventional wisdom, fens in continental climates accumulate peat at similar or greater rates than do bogs in oceanic climates.

AB Deep ruts in soil hinder the movement of off-road vehicles and harm drastically the soil environment. The aim of this study was to determine the most suitable cone and remoulding index based methods for rut depth estimation for single and repeated military vehicle passage in typical Estonian soils. Cone index based sinkage models - US Army ERDC, Maclaurin (1990) and Willoughby and Tumage sinkage models applicable for military vehicles were tested, using different critical layers (0-15 cm, 7.5-23 cm or 15-30 cm). The test vehicles were a 7 Mg truck and a 23 Mg armoured personnel carrier. At eight experimental sites covering mechanically very variable soil conditions (from peat to clay soil), rut depth was measured after one and ten vehicle passes, cone penetration tests were conducted in situ, and samples were collected for determination of bulk density, organic carbon content, texture, gravimetric water content, plastic and liquid limits of the topsoil and subsoil. According to average RMSD values for military truck the Willoughby and Turnage model was the most accurate prediction method. For one pass and 10 passes the rating cone index values from the 7.5-23 cm and 15-30 cm soil layer, respectively, produced the lowest RMSD values. (C) 2017 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Regional-scale soil organic carbon (SOC) field investigations would significantly improve our understanding of national and global SOC sequestration and carbon (C) cycles. The Zoige wetland is the world's largest high-altitude wetland. It is located in northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Although considered sensitive to global climate change, little is known of its wetland SOC stocks and spatial distribution patterns. Accordingly, we investigated SOC stocks and spatial distribution patterns in the uppermost 1 m soil layer in Ruoergai and Hongyuan counties in the Zoige wetland. We found that SOC decreased with increasing soil depth, which was highest in the topmost 0.3 m soil layer. Total nitrogen and water content were positively correlated to SOC content while bulk density was negatively correlated to SOC content in both wetland and grassland areas. Wetlands had a higher SOC density than grassland. In the uppermost 1 m of wetland soil, average SOC density, was 69.5 kg C m(-3), greater by a factor of three compared to mean wetland SOC density in China and greater by a factor of six compared to the national average. SOC stock in the uppermost 1 m of wetland, soils totaled 514 Tg C, of which 50% was stored in the topmost 03 m. This indicated that the two counties in the Zoige wetland stores from 8.3 to 102% of the total SOC in China in the topmost 1 m of wetland soils. This vast SOC pool and high SOC density requires sound land use practices to sustain and protect Zoige wetland ecosystem services and C stocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Today, various organic matters are used as growth media. Most of them are combined with various materials, such as a mixture of peat moss and pine bark, or a mixture of peat moss and pine bark with mineral materials like perlite or vermiculite. All over the world, stone wool and other materials like perlite, pumice, polyortan phome, zeolite, coco peat and sawdust are used as growth media in soilless culture. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of incubation time on the physicochemical properties of date palm wastes and their effects on growing indexes of tomato in comparison with perlite when used as culture substrates. The date palm wastes were first manually chopped into small pieces, after which they were kept in plastic bags. They were adjusted to 55% moisture content and thoroughly mixed once every week. Treatments were done for 4 incubation times (0, 1, 3 and 9 months). The physicochemical properties of materials were analyzed during 3 months. After 3 months of incubation, for comparison of this composting materials (date-palm) with other substrates, perlite and the composting materials were used as growth media. The research was conducted in a completely randomized design with 6 replications of tomato for 6 months. Treatments included perlite, date-palm1 (without incubation time) and date-palm2 (with 3 months incubation time). During plant growth irrigation rate, temperature, humidity and pest control for all treatments were similar. During plant growth, Papadopolus formula with fertigation method was used for the nutrient solution. The plants were kept for 6 months, then after this period, the physicochemical properties of these materials were analyzed again. So, the growing indexes of tomato, which included fruit yield, plant height, fruit number, stem diameter, TSS and biomass, were measured. The results of incubation time period showed that changes of porosity, bulk density, pH, C/N ratio and CEC had significant differences (p<0.05). The C/N ratio reduced, while the bulk density and CEC increased by the increase in incubation time period. Comparison of tomato growing indexes in the different substrates showed that fruit yield, plant height and fruit number of tomato had no significant differences at 5% level, but stem diameter and biomass in date-palm1 was higher than other media and thus, had significant differences at 5% level.

AB Drained peatlands contribute to anthropic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), so a better understanding of the underlying processes and identification of mitigation options for agricultural peatlands are urgently required. Peatland soil properties vary greatly and, in combination with drainage, can affect emissions of CO2 both directly and indirectly. Drainage reduces soil water content but increases CO2 production, so it is important to find the optimum drainage level that minimises CO2 emissions without affecting agricultural use. Intact soil cores from nine different sites (topsoil, plus subsoil at four sites) were collected and brought into a controlled laboratory environment. Repeated measurements of CO2 fluxes were performed at increasing soil water suctions corresponding to different drainage levels. Physical and chemical properties of the soils were determined and compared with the CO2 emissions. The soil cores displayed different CO2 emission patterns with increasing soil water suction head. In some cores, emissions increased rapidly to a high level, while in others they remained at lower levels. At a soil water suction head of only 0.5 m of water, the average soil CO2 emissions had already reached a maximum. The soil cores represented peat soils with a wide range of soil properties, e.g. bulk density from 0.17 to 0.47 g cm(-3) and total carbon from 26.3 to 43.5 %, but none of the properties measured was clearly correlated with CO2 emissions.

AB Background, aim, and scope Fluorescence and UV-visible spectroscopies are simple but useful methods to characterize organic matter in the aqueous phase according to its aromatic nature and humification degree. Although there are several studies about porewater and water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) from peat, at present, no comparative investigations are available in the literature. Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify and compare chemical and spectroscopic features of porewaters and corresponding WEOM samples along a 105-cm undisturbed peat profile.
   Material and methods The peat core was collected in June 2005 from a Swiss ombrotrophic bog and divided into slices of 1 +/- 0.15-cm thickness. Porewater samples (n=91) were extracted and analyzed for pH; from these, 30 samples were filtered (0.45 mu m), analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and characterized by means of UV-vis (E(4)/E(6) ratio) and fluorescence spectroscopies. The same analyses were also carried out on the WEOM of the corresponding peat samples.
   Results and conclusions The results show several differences between porewaters and WEOM throughout the bog profile. In particular, and with the exception of the first ca. 20 cm depth, spectroscopic data clearly underline a more "humic-like" character of DOC of WEOM compared to porewater samples. Furthermore, the trends in E(4)/E(6) ratios of both porewaters and WEOM samples indicate that the organic matter is characterized by decreasing aromaticity, molecular weights, and degree of polycondensation throughout the profile. The high correlation among the bulk density of the peat and the DOC concentrations in both porewaters and WEOM samples demonstrates a clear stratification of the organic matter which suggests that the vertical migration of DOC is rather limited. The first ca. 20 cm of the profile shows also opposite physicochemical and spectroscopic features compared to the deeper horizons probably because this is the predominantly oxic zone with far greater physiological activity of plants and microorganisms.
   Recommendations and perspectives Assessing porewater and WEOM features throughout peat, soil, and sediment profiles is important to better understand water-sediment interface dynamics and translocation processes of organic and inorganic pollutants, especially considering that ombrotrophic bogs are often used as archives of atmospheric depositions.

AB Technical activated carbons WG-12, ROW 08 Supra and F-300 have been modified using ultrasonic field. Firstly was examined the activated carbon WG-12 produced by GRYFSKAND of Hajnowka in Poland. ROW 08 Supra is granulated and refined activated carbon, which can be thermally regenerated. It is produced from peat by Dutch company NORIT by the use of steam-gas method. The carbon is characterized by a large volume of pores and large size of the grains, which makes, that is commonly used for drinking water treatment in order to enhance the taste of the water and remove the odor, chlorine, ozone and micropollutants (e.g., dissolved organic substances or pesticides). The carbon F-300 is produced by the Belgian company CHEMVIRON CARBON.
   Sonication of activated carbons was carried out in an ultrasonic generator UPS 400 S Hielscher's designed for stationary use. The modification of activated carbons by sonication was made as follows: the test coals were filled with distilled water in an amount of 500 cm(3) and treated by ultrasonic field for 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. Two series of tests were performed with amplitudes equal 50 and 100%.
   After sonication process, activated carbons were dried at 145 degrees C to obtain of constant weight. Then, an analysis of selected technical indicators such as bulk density, iodine number, the number of the methylene and the ash content according to the PN were made.

AB The acrotelm-catotelm model of peatland hydrological and biogeochemical processes posits that the permeability of raised bogs is largely homogenous laterally but varies strongly with depth through the soil profile; uppermost peat layers are highly permeable while deeper layers are, effectively, impermeable. We measured down-core changes in peat permeability, plant macrofossil assemblages, dry bulk density and degree of humification beneath two types of characteristic peatland microform - ridges and hollows - at a raised bog in Wales. Six C-14 dates were also collected for one hollow and an adjacent ridge. Contrary to the acrotelm-catotelm model, we found that deeper peat can be as highly permeable as near-surface peat and that its permeability can vary by more than an order of magnitude between microforms over horizontal distances of 1-5m. Our palaeoecological data paint a complicated picture of microform persistence. Some microforms can remain in the same position on a bog for millennia, growing vertically upwards as the bog grows. However, adjacent areas on the bog (<10m distant) show switches between microform type over time, indicating a lack of persistence.Synthesis. We suggest that the acrotelm-catotelm model should be used cautiously; spatial variations in peatland permeability do not fit the simple patterns suggested by the model. To understand how peatlands as a whole function both hydrologically and ecologically, it is necessary to understand how patterns of peat physical properties and peatland vegetation develop and persist.

AB Peatlands play an important role in emissions of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O, which are produced during mineralization of the peat organic matter. To examine the influence of soil type (fen, bog soil) and environmental factors (temperature, groundwater level), emission of CO2, CH4 and N2O and soil temperature and groundwater level were measured weekly or biweekly in loco over a one-year period at four sites located in Ljubljana Marsh, Slovenia using the static chamber technique. The study involved two fen and two bog soils differing in organic carbon and nitrogen content, pH, bulk density, water holding capacity and groundwater level. The lowest CO2 fluxes occurred during the winter, fluxes of N2O were highest during summer and early spring (February, March) and fluxes of CH4 were highest during autumn. The temporal variation in CO2 fluxes could be explained by seasonal temperature variations, whereas CH4 and N2O fluxes could be correlated to groundwater level and soil carbon content. The experimental sites were net sources of measured greenhouse gases except for the drained bog site, which was a net sink of CH4. The mean fluxes of CO2 ranged between 139 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the undrained bog and 206 mg m(-2) h-(1) in the drained fen; mean fluxes of CH4 were between -0.04 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained bog and 0.05 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained fen; and mean fluxes of N2O were between 0.43 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained fen and 1.03 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the drained bog. These results indicate that the examined peatlands emit similar amounts of CO2 and CH4 to peatlands in Central and Northern Europe and significantly higher amounts of N2O. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a global meta-analysis with a database of 209 sites to examine the effects of LULCC types of constructed wetlands (CWs), croplands (CLs), aquaculture ponds (APs), drained wetlands (DWs), and pastures (PASs) on the variability in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the natural coastal wetlands, riparian wetlands, and peatlands. Our results showed that the natural wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric CO2 and net sources of CH4 and N2O, exhibiting the capacity to mitigate greenhouse effects due to negative comprehensive global warming potentials (GWPs; -0.9 to -8.7 t CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1)). Relative to the natural wetlands, all LULCC types (except CWs from coastal wetlands) decreased the net CO2 uptake by 69.7%-456.6%, due to a higher increase in ecosystem respiration relative to slight changes in gross primary production. The CWs and APs significantly increased the CH4 emissions compared to those of the coastal wetlands. All LULCC types associated with the riparian wetlands significantly decreased the CH4 emissions. When the peatlands were converted to the PASs, the CH4 emissions significantly increased. The CLs, as well as DWs from peatlands, significantly increased the N2O emissions in the natural wetlands. As a result, all LULCC types (except PASs from riparian wetlands) led to remarkably higher GWPs by 65.4%-2,948.8%, compared to those of the natural wetlands. The variability in GHG fluxes with LULCC was mainly sensitive to changes in soil water content, water table, salinity, soil nitrogen content, soil pH, and bulk density. This study highlights the significant role of LULCC in increasing comprehensive GHG emissions from global natural wetlands, and our results are useful for improving future models and manipulative experiments.

AB Detailed, accurate information on soil temperature is crucial for understanding processes leading to solute leaching and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from managed peat soils, but few studies have attempted to study these processes in detail. Drained peat soils have different characteristics from pristine peat. Cultivated peat soils, in particular, have high mineral matter content in the plough layer, due to mineralisation of peat and, sometimes, addition of mineral material. This study examined the effect of mineral matter content on thermal conductivity (lambda) in partially frozen and unfrozen peat samples. Effect of change in temperature from -3 degrees C to - 10 degrees C on thermal conductivity was also estimated. Three existing models for estimating the thermal conductivity of organic soils were assessed for their suitability for cultivated drained peat soils. The thermal conductivity of peat samples with three different levels of mineral matter content was determined, using the single probe method, in the saturated state and when subjected to at least two different matric potentials at five different temperatures ( + 10 degrees C, + 1 degrees C, - 3 degrees C, - 5 degrees C and -10 degrees C). The results showed that X values differed between peat soils depending on mineral matter content, ice content and moisture content. The samples with the highest mineral matter content and bulk density had higher thermal conductivity at positive temperatures and to a lesser extent, at freezing temperatures, when volumetric water content and volume of water-free pores was similar. Most soil samples, especially those with no added mineral soil, were not fully frozen at - 3 degrees C and - 5 degrees C, but this had minor effect on thermal conductivity compared with values measured at -10 degrees C. The Brovka-Rovdan model proved reasonably good at predicting frozen thermal conductivity in sand-enriched peat soils, while the de Vries model proved best at estimating thermal conductivity for unfrozen peat samples. We provide a first estimate of the thermal conductivity of (partially) frozen cultivated peat measured using undisturbed samples. These results can be used to parameterise numerical heat transport models for simulating soil processes and GHG emissions.

AB Leaf size indices of the tree species in the peatland of Agusan del Sur in Mindanao in Philippines was examined to deduce the variation of forest structure and observed forest zonation. Using raunkiaer and webb's leaf size classification, the leaf morphometrics of seven tree species consistently found on the established sampling plots were determined. The species includes Ternstroemia philippinensis Merr., Polyscias aherniana Merr. Lowry and G.M. Plunkett, Calophyllum sclerophyllum Vesque, Fagraea racemosa Jack, Ilex cymosa Blume, Syzygium tenuirame (Miq.) Merr. and Tristaniopsis micrantha Merr. Peter G. Wilson and J.T. Waterh. The LSI were correlated against the variables of the peat physicochemical properties (such as bulk density, acrotelm thickness, peat depth, total organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, pH); water (pH, ammonium, nitrate, phosphate); and leaf tissue elements (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium). Result showed a decreasing leaf size indices and a three leaf size category consisting of mesophyllous, mesophyllous-notophyllous and microphyllous were observed which corresponds to the structure of vegetation i.e., from the tall-pole forest having the biggest average leaf area of 6,142.29 mm(2) to the pygmy forest with average leaf area of 1,670.10 mm(2). Such decreased leaf size indices were strongly correlated to soil nitrogen, acrotelm thickness, peat depth, phosphate in water, nitrogen and phosphorus in the plant tissue.

AB Northern boreal peatlands are important ecosystems in modulating global biogeochemical cycles, yet their biological communities and related carbon dynamics are highly sensitive to changes in climate. Despite this, the strength and recent direction of these feedbacks are still unclear. The response of boreal peatlands to climate warming has received relatively little attention compared with other northern peatland types, despite forming a large northern hemisphere-wide ecosystem. Here, we studied the response of two ombrotrophic boreal peatlands to climate variability over the last c. 200 years for which local meteorological data are available. We used remains from plants and testate amoebae to study historical changes in peatland biological communities. These data were supplemented by peat property (bulk density, carbon and nitrogen content), C-14, Pb-210 and Cs-137 analyses and were used to infer changes in peatland hydrology and carbon dynamics. In total, six peat cores, three per study site, were studied that represent different microhabitats: low hummock (LH), high lawn and low lawn. The data show a consistent drying trend over recent centuries, represented mainly as a change from wet habitat Sphagnum spp. to dry habitat S. fuscum. Summer temperature and precipitation appeared to be important drivers shaping peatland community and surface moisture conditions. Data from the driest microhabitat studied, LH, revealed a clear and strong negative linear correlation (R-2 = .5031; p < .001) between carbon accumulation rate and peat surface moisture conditions: under dry conditions, less carbon was accumulated. This suggests that at the dry end of the moisture gradient, availability of water regulates carbon accumulation. It can be further linked to the decreased abundance of mixotrophic testate amoebae under drier conditions (R-2 = .4207; p < .001). Our study implies that if effective precipitation decreases in the future, the carbon uptake capacity of boreal bogs may be threatened.

AB Soilless substrates are primarily used in the production of containerized greenhouse and nursery crops. Sphagnum peat moss is a primary constituent of these substrates and its harvest from endangered ecosystems has become a worldwide concern. Ethanol-extracted, coarse-ground corn (Zea mays L.. 'Silver Queen') tassels were used as a peat replacement for potting substrates. Replacing peat moss with increasing levels of ground tassel (up to 50%, v/v) elevated pH and electrical conductance, while having variable effects on substrate physical properties (bulk density, percent solids, air porosity, container capacity, and total porosity). Two identical greenhouse experiments separated by time were conducted using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L 'Red Robin') plants grown in 6.0-L pots. In the first experiment, all substrates were similar for total tomato yield per plant and number of fruit per plant, with only the 50% tassel substrate having significantly lower values. There were no differences for plant height or average fruit weight among substrates. No differences were found for any of these variables in the second experiment. This research indicates that extracted ground tassels may be utilized as a suitable replacement for peat in greenhouse substrates for tomatoes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The genus Vaccinium includes cowberries, cranberries and blueberries. Nowadays they are under large scale cultivation for the purposes of fruit production. In the Republic of Belarus bog blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum L.) can be met in situ; among the cultivated plants the most prevalent varieties are highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) and lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifilium Ait.). Blueberry is rich in bioactive substances, such as organic acids, anthocyanins, pectin and tannins. The leaves and fruits of blueberries are a promising plant raw material for the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. It is useful for the production of herbal teas, juices, jams, preserves, shampoos, creams, infusions, extracts, etc. For the improved process of extracting leaves and fruits of blueberries, as well as quality estimation of extracts, it is necessary to know the basic technological properties of raw materials. During the study, the technological properties of various lowbush blueberry species were found. The properties of leaves are the following: bulk density - from 0.08 +/- 0.001 to 0.13 +/- 0.001 g/cm(3); unit weight - from 1.20 +/- 0.003 to 2.10 +/- 0.001 g/cm(3); bulk weight - from 0.09 +/- 0.001 to 0.14 +/- 0.003 g/cm(3); porosity - from 0.04 +/- 0.001 to 0.06 +/- 0.002, void cross-section - from 0.89 +/- 0.001 to 0.95 +/- 0.001; absorption coefficient for water - from 4.99 +/- 0.10 to 6.09 +/- 0.10 cm(3)/g, 30 % ethanol - from 4.50 +/- 0.10 to 5.49 +/- 0.01 cm(3)/g, 50 % ethanol - from 4.25 +/- 0.05 to 5.03 +/- 0.05 cm(3)/g, 70 % ethanol - from 3.74 +/- 0.16 to 4.74 +/- 0.19 cm(3)/g and 96 % ethanol - from 2.75 +/- 0.15 to 3.49 +/- 0.09 cm(3)/g. The properties of fruits are the following: bulk density - from 0.57 +/- 0.001 to 0.69 +/- 0.001 g/cm(3); unit weight - from 1.32 +/- 0.059 to 1.48 +/- 0.040 g/cm(3); bulk weight - from 0.59 +/- 0.001 to 0.70 +/- 0.001 g/cm(3); porosity - from 0.02 +/- 0.001 to 0.03 +/- 0.001; void cross-section - from 0.48 +/- 0.01 to 0.59 +/- 0.001; absorption coefficient for water - from 4.06 +/- 0.16 to 4.52 +/- 0.17 cm(3)/g, 30 % ethanol - from 3.38 +/- 0.05 to 4.06 +/- 0.02 cm(3)/g, 50 % ethanol - from 3.36 +/- 0.03 to 3.94 +/- 0.08 cm(3)/g. 70 % ethanol - from 2.86 +/- 0.09 to 3.74 +/- 0.07 cm(3)/g and 96 % ethanol - from 0.94 +/- 0.04 to 1.04 +/- 0.01 cm(3)/g. The obtained data allow to predict the optimal method and conditions of bioactive substances extraction from blueberry' leaves and fruit. The data can also be used in the development of technological documentation which regulates the production process and the quality of the final product, as well as in the calculation of the process mass balance to ensure the appropriate level of profitability.

AB Increased human activities since discovery of gold in northern California have changed the structure and function of many ecosystems. To reconstruct the changes in watershed environmental conditions, sediment cores were collected from three montane marshes in northern Sierra Nevada, CA. Pollen analysis was conducted, and water content, bulk density, ash, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, major cations, and lead concentrations of sediments were determined. Cores were dated by the Pb-210 method. Pollen analyses showed changes in plant communities in this region due to severe logging in the late-1800s and moderate logging in the 1900s. The local changes were more clearly recorded in small marsh pollen profiles than regional changes. The water milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) introduction into Tahoe Basin was inferred from the pollen record and Pb-210 dating. Road construction and maintenance activities were recorded in physical and chemical characteristics, such as increases in sodium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations. Pollen and physical and chemical records also documented the time line of the expansion of dry meadow, and the decrease of pine forest in one of the watersheds. This study showed that sediments in small marshes were especially useful to reconstruct local disturbance by human activities.

AB High productivity and waterlogged conditions make many freshwater wetlands significant carbon sinks. Most wetland carbon studies focus on boreal peatlands, however, with less attention paid to other climates and to the effects of hydrogeomorphic settings and the importance of wetland vegetation communities on carbon sequestration. This study compares six temperate wetland communities in Ohio that belong to two distinct hydrogeomorphic types: an isolated depressional wetland site connected to the groundwater table, and a riverine flow-through wetland site that receives water from an agricultural watershed. Three cores were extracted in each community and analyzed for total carbon content to determine the soil carbon pool. Sequestration rates were determined by radiometric dating with 137Cs and 210Pb on a set of composite cores extracted in each of the six communities. Cores were also extracted in uplands adjacent to the wetlands at each site. Wetland communities had accretion rates ranging from 3.0 to 6.2 mm yr-1. The depressional wetland sites had higher (P < 0.001) organic content (146 +/- 4.2 gC kg-1) and lower (P < 0.001) bulk density (0.55 +/- 0.01 Mg m-3) than the riverine ones (50.1 +/- 6.9 gC kg-1 and 0.74 +/- 0.06 Mg m-3). The soil carbon was 9899% organic in the isolated depressional wetland communities and 8598% organic in the riverine ones. The depressional wetland communities sequestered 317 +/- 93 gC m-2 yr-1, more (P < 0.01) than the riverine communities that sequestered 140 +/- 16 gC m-2 yr-1. The highest sequestration rate was found in the Quercus palustris forested wetland community (473 gC m-2 yr-1), while the wetland community dominated by water lotus (Nelumbo lutea) was the most efficient of the riverine communities, sequestering 160 gC m-2 yr-1. These differences in sequestration suggest the importance of addressing wetland types and communities in more detail when assessing the role of wetlands as carbon sequestering systems in global carbon budgets.

AB Nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) play important roles in peatlands, through their influence on plant production and peat decomposition rates and on redox reactions, respectively, and peatlands contain substantial stores of these two elements. Using peat N and S concentrations and dry bulk density and Pb-210 dating, we determined the rates of N and S accumulation over the past 150 years in hummock and hollow profiles from 23 ombrotrophic bogs in eastern Canada. Concentrations of N and S averaged 0.80% and 0.18%, respectively, generally increased with depth in the profile and there was a weak but significant correlation between N and S concentrations. Rates of N and S accumulation over the past 50-150 years ranged from 0.5 to 4.8 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and from 0.1 to 0.9 g S m(-2) yr(-1). There were significant but weak correlations between C, N and S accumulation rates over 50-, 100- and 150-year periods. Over the last 50 years, rates of S accumulation showed little differentiation between hummocks and hollows, whereas the pattern for N accumulation was more variable (hummock minus hollow rate ranged from -1 to +1.5 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), with hummocks generally having a larger N accumulation rate, correlated with the rate of carbon (C) accumulation. There was a modest but significant positive correlation between 50-year rates of N accumulation and wet atmospheric deposition of N measured between 1990 and 1996, with accumulation rates about four times that of wet deposition. The difference between deposition and accumulation of N is attributed to organic N deposition, dry deposition and N-2 fixation. A weaker, but still significant, correlation was observed between 50-year S accumulation and 1990-1996 wet atmospheric S deposition, with about 75% of the deposited S accumulating in the peat. A laboratory experiment with peat cores exposed to varying water table position and simulated N and S deposition, showed that on average 87% and 98% of the deposited NH4+ and NO3-, respectively, and 58% of the deposited S were retained in the vegetation and unsaturated zone of the cores, supporting the results from the field study.

AB Detailed palynological analyses, including pollen preservation and charcoal counts, and sedimentological analyses (loss-on-ignition, percentage dry weight, dry bulk density and humification), supported by 15 C-14 dates, were applied to a small upland (350 m OD) peat basin near Pitlochry, east-central Grampians, Scotland. Stratigraphical analyses and radiocarbon dating were also undertaken on the valley peat surrounding the basin.
   Organic sediment began to accumulate in the basin and on the valley floor at ca. 9800 yr BP. 'Recurrence surfaces' within the valley floor peat correlate with the end of a trend to increased aridity in the deep basin, from 8900 to 8500 yr BP. Pine may have colonised the hills, with birch, before the migration of hazel at 9150 yr BP. From around 8000 yr BP elm grew on the base-rich soils. Alder may have been present by 7000 yr BP but it did not expand until immediately after the first major anthropogenic disturbance, at 4800 yr BP.
   Above 8000 yr BP silt was commonly deposited in the basin by streams, but several phases of exceptionally intense inwashing are identified, and at least two of these correlate with periods of increased precipitation.
   Grazing pressure during the elm decline marks the beginning of a long history of generally low intensity pastoralism, interspersed with periods of heightened anthropogenic activity.

AB Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were determined for surface peat samples for 78 sites on both undrained and drained pine mires. The oldest areas had been drained 55 years earlier. Generally, the N and P stores in a 0 - 50 cm peat layer increased with increasing drainage age in oligo-ombrotrophic sites, and remained unchanged in meso-oligotrophic sites, even if large quantities were bound up in the increasing tree stand biomasses. This was mainly caused by post-drainage subsidence of the mire surface and the consequent compaction, which increased the peat bulk densities and brought new stores from deeper peat layers into the layer under observation. Measured stand volumes and published values for N and P concentrations of tree stand compartments were used to estimate the amounts of N and P bound up in the tree stands. The estimates of N and P in the tree stands of the oldest drainage areas were considerable (ca. 400 kg N and 40 kg P ha-1 in the meso-oligotrophic and ca. 300 kg N and 30 kg P ha-1 in the oligo-ombrotrophic sites), but were small when compared to the stores in the peat (ca. 10 000 kg N and 400 kg P ha-1 in the meso-oligotrophic and ca. 7000 kg N and 300 kg P ha-1 in the oligo-ombrotrophic sites in the 0-50 cm layer).

AB The rates of carbon (C) accumulation and the role of fires in the C dynamics of the major types of boreal West Siberian mires were investigated. Detailed analysis of dry bulk density, C, and N concentration and age of the peat layers were used to determine C accumulation rates throughout the Holocene. The average long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) at 11 studied sites was 17.2 +/-1.0 (SE) g m(-2) yr(-1), ranging from 12.1 to 23.7 g m(-2) yr(-1), and the total apparent carbon sink 11.8 Tg yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12) g) for Russian raised string bogs (68.5 million hectares). These estimates of C accumulation in West Siberian mires are roughly a half of the earlier estimates for these boreal mires. Differences in LORCA for three major mire types in the study area, the ridge-hollow pine bogs, Sphagnum fuscum pine bogs, and dwarf-shrub pine bogs, were not significant. The age versus depth (measured as cumulative carbon from the surface downward) curve was slightly convex, indicating a general declining trend in LORCA with decreasing age. About 55% of the present carbon store was already accumulated about 6000 cal. BP. The most intensive expansion phase of the study area occurred between 7000 and 8000 cal. BP. The subsequent lateral expansion has been very slow in the later Holocene. The charcoal data indicated that these mires have burned only 2-3 times during the past 7000-8000 cal. BP, and only a strip of a few meters along the mire margins has burned relatively frequently No evidence of significant carbon losses due to fires could be found. The charcoal layers at the mire margins suggest a declining trend in burning rates during the later Holocene.

DE Lake Shkodra; Medieval; Alluvial fan aggradation; Kir River
ID ALBANIA/MONTENEGRO; SEDIMENTATION
AB The analysis of sediment cores and auger holes from the wetland fringe of Lake Shkodra were used to interpret late Holocene shoreline fluctuations in northwestern Albania. Dry bulk density, organic carbon, magnetic susceptibility, particle size determination, sediment composition, X-ray diffraction, and AMS C-14 dating provide the basis for interpretation. The Kir River may have sourced the 50 km(2) Late Pleistocene-Holocene Shtoj alluvial fan at the terminus of the 372 km(2) Kir River drainage basin on the western slopes of the Bjeshket e Namuna Mountains. However, the Kir River has not transected the fan since at least the first century BC. The vertical succession of facies in sediment cores from peat to lacustrine clay and then to over 1.1 m of alluvial silt and sand documents an expansion, then contraction of the lake to its current size after 1390 cal yr BP. Sand influx off the fan is attributed to sheetflow, rill, or gullying related to increased anthropogenic activity across the fan during Medieval time. Archaeological surveys support abandonment of hill fort dwellings for the plain around 500 CE. Since 1390 cal yr BP, the Lake Shkodra shoreline has fluctuated at least 1.5 km to the east of the present shoreline. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Retired farmland restoration is increasingly seen as a valuable opportunity to improve ecosystem functions in sensitive regions. For example, with expected mass retirement of cranberry farms in New England, there is increasing interest in restoring retired cranberry farms back to wetlands. To understand how restoration of retired cranberry farms to wetland ecosystems influences climate-related ecosystem functions, we assessed methane and carbon dioxide emissions from different post-farming management options, including an actively farmed cranberry bog, young and old retired cranberry bogs, young and old restored cranberry bogs, and a natural reference bog. In addition to methane and carbon dioxide, we measured key soil properties influential in greenhouse gas flux, including soil organic matter, moisture, pH, redox potential, and bulk density. Greenhouse gas flux differed significantly by site type, with the restored systems functioning similarly to the natural reference wetland while retired sites had fluxes similar to the actively farmed site. The older restored site had significantly lower emissions of both methane and carbon dioxide than the newly restored site, indicating that over a larger time scale, restored systems may transition from net carbon dioxide sources to sinks. Overall, the results of this study suggest that in addition to the many other ecological benefits, the restoration of wetlands may also play a role in climate change mitigation through their ability to store carbon.

AB This paper reports on research designed to test the hypothesis that differences in peat composition will cause, differences in amounts of N and P retained during contact with liquid swine manure (LSM) and liquid poultry manure (LPM). Peat types representing. a wide range of properties were tested in order to establish which chemical and physical properties might be most indicative of their capacities to, retain N and P from LSM and LPM. Eight-percent slurries (peat/LSM and peat/LPM) were measured for total nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorous (TP) after 6, 24 and 96 hours. Tests were done to determine the TKN and TP contents of these peats, the LSM, and the LPM, both before and after they were mixed together.
   The N and P retention results revealed that most. peats worked reasonably well at retaining N and P from either LSM or LPM. However, some peats were more effective than others. These peats also decreased the N. and P levels in the liquid portion of the LSM. Peats with higher N retention capacities tended to have lower ash contents, but higher macroporosities and total cellulose contents. Peals with higher P retention capacities tended to have lower bulk densities, ash contents, total guaiacyl lignins contents, fulvic acids contents, but higher microporosities, macroporosities, H contents, and total cellulose contents. Peats with higher N and P retention capacities also had humic acid contents between 5-7%. The results of this study suggest that if these peats are used to reduce odors and N and P contamination, possible byproducts could be the production of odorless fertilizers.

AB In the present work, a new simple and quick eco-friendly method is discussed to handle effectively the green wastes and produce a sustainable peat substitute of high quality on the large scale. Principal physicochemical parameters, i.e., temperature, moisture, specific weight, pH, electrical conductivity and, also, microorganisms, organic matter, humic substances, total Kjeldahl nitrogen and total organic carbon, C/N ratio, ash, metal content and phytotoxicity, were monitored systematically. Humic substances content values were interrelated to both C/N ratio and pH values and, similarly, bulk density, TOC, TKN, C/N, GI, ash and organic matter were found interconnected to each other. A novel biocatalyst, extremely rich in soil microorganisms, prepared from compost extracts and peaty lignite, accelerated the biotransformation. Zeolite was also employed. The compost does not demonstrate any phytotoxicity throughout the entire biotransformation process and has increased humic substances content. Both humic substances content and germination index can be employed as maturation indices of the compost. Addition of compost, processed for 60 days only, in cultivations of grass plants led to a significant increase in the stem mass and root size, annotating the significant contribution of the compost to both growth and germination. The product obtained is comparable to peat humus, useful as peat substitute and can be classified as a first class soil conditioner suitable for organic farming. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

SO BIOLOGICAL WASTES

DT Article
ID CRAB SCRAP; FISH; WASTES
AB The feasibility of composting high-moisture manure slurries in combination with hydrophilic peat moss was examined.  Horticultural grade peat, with or without lime (1% Ca in peat), was mixed with manure slurries from dairy cows, poultry, or sheep, in a feed-mixer.  The mixtures were discharged on to a bed of peat (10 cm), overlain by horizontal perforated pipes open to the atmosphere, to construct small windrows which were then covered by a 5-cm layer of deodorizing and hygienic peat.  The amphoteric peat of acidic pH adsorbed the NH3 and any other malodorous compounds, and its fibrosity (bulk density 0.06 g cm-3) supported aerobic thermophilic decomposition in which neither malodorous amines nor sulphides were produced significantly.  No detectable NH3 or H2S emanated from the compost piles.  Temperatures greater than 45-degrees-C were reached in the composts within 1-3 days and maintained above 45-degrees-C for 2-5 weeks without further mixing of the composts, or any mechanical aeration.  When the composts were remixed and reheaped, 7 weeks after initial formulation, no reheating occurred-suggesting that the composts were 'biostable', as is peat. Germination tests confirmed the 'biostability'.  The mature composts had water-holding capacities nearly equal to that of the original peat, suggesting that the air-dried peat-manure composts can be recharged with manure slurries.  The properties of the composts suggested that they could be marketed and used as a substitute or supplement for the limed and fertilized peat generally used in gardening, landscaping and greenhouse culture.

ID GROWTH; EXPERIENCES; WASTES; SOIL
AB Sphagnum peat has been the most commonly used growing medium in containers in tree nurseries worldwide for its good growing properties. As a result of increasing costs and environmental incentives, seedling-growers are seeking more local growing medium components such as composts. Composts are, however, diverse products with varying chemical, physical, and hygienic properties and therefore require thorough testing before real-world use. In this study, a commonly used compost (raw materials: sewage sludge, biowaste, peat, wood chips) was tested for feasibility as a component (0-30 vol.%) of a sphagnum peat container medium for growing Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) container seedlings in a forest-tree nursery. In proportions of up to 30% in peat, the compost additive used was shown to be a feasible material for seedling growing in forest nurseries. On average, the seedlings grew best in pure peat, but the compost additions to peat showed no marked reduction in seedling growth in greenhouses, nor were there any effect on seedling growth in the first summer after outplanting. However, a slightly elevated risk of seed non-germination and of seedling mortality was observed when the growing media contained compost in proportions of 20% or more. The compost additive in peat also changed the bulk density, structure, and chemical properties of the medium during nursery growing. The results suggest that seedling watering and fertilisation should be adjusted for each growing medium mix separately to achieve correct water, oxygen, and nutrient availability in containers during nursery growing.

TI Evaporation Method for Measuring Unsaturated Hydraulic Properties of
   Soils: Extending the Measurement Range
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; WATER; CONDUCTIVITY; REEVALUATION; TENSION; STATE
AB The evaporation method is frequently used for simultaneous determination of soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity relationships. Tension is measured at two depths within a short soil column as water evaporates from its surface. Water content and flux are determined by weighing the column. Tensions, water contents, and fluxes are used to derive the water retention curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function. The measurement range of the conventional procedure is limited on the wet end by the inability of pressure transducers to accurately register very small tension differences. Hence, the resulting calculated hydraulic gradient in the vertical direction is associated with large uncertainties. On the dry end, water cavitation in the tensiometer, which typically occurs around 70 to 90 kPa, is the limitation. We present here a new design based on improved tensiometers that resist cavitation to much higher tensions, some reaching values as high as 435 kPa. On the wet end, data from a simple steady-state method were used to supplement the evaporation method. On the dry end, applying the new tensiometers enabled the quantification of hydraulic functions up to 293 kPa average tension. Experimental results and soil water simulation affirmed the validity of the linearization assumption, even on the dry end when nonlinear tension depth profiles emerge. The application of evaporation functions as a supplement for frequent weighing reduces costs for the equipment and increases the effectiveness of the method. Their validity for deriving fluxes was confirmed for the extended range, too. Results are presented for soil samples of different textures (sand, loam, silt, clay, and peat), various origins, and various dry bulk densities.

AB Aims Fencing to prevent livestock grazing has widely been implemented to restore vegetation and soils of degraded alpine meadows on the Zoige Plateau in recent decades, but its efficacy is still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the responses of plant community and soil properties to long-term fencing. Methods We surveyed vegetation structure and production, soil physical and chemical properties in three sites, each having paired adjacent plots (i.e. one was fenced for 11-17 years and the other was allowed for regular grazing). Results Long-term fencing resulted in species loss at the community level and decreased plant species richness at the plot level. Fencing increased aboveground plant biomass and plant litter accumulation but reduced root biomass, and in particular it dramatically increased the aboveground biomass of grasses at the expense of legumes and sedges. Moreover, fencing decreased soil organic carbon and total N concentrations, and soil bulk density, but increased soil water infiltration rate, soil total P and soluble N concentrations, while soil soluble P concentration remained unchanged. Conclusions These results indicate that long-term (> 11 years) fencing is not beneficial to plant diversity and soil organic carbon sequestration of the Zoige alpine meadows.

AB It is assumed that to treat excess NO3- high soil organic matter content (%OM) is required to maintain high denitrification rates in natural or restored wetlands. However, this excess also represents a risk by increasing soil decomposition rates triggering peat collapse and wetland fragmentation. Here, we evaluated the role of %OM and temperature interactions controlling denitrification rates in eroding (Barataria Bay-BLC) and emerging (Wax Lake Delta-WLD) deltaic regions in coastal Louisiana using the isotope pairing (IPT) and N-2:Ar techniques. We also assessed differences between total (direct denitrification + coupled nitrification-denitrification) and net (total denitrification minus nitrogen fixation) denitrification rates in benthic and wetland habitats with contrasting %OM and bulk density (BD). Sediment (benthic) and soil (wetland) cores were collected during summer, spring, and winter (2015-2016) and incubated at close to in-situ temperatures (30 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 10 degrees C, respectively). Denitrification rates were linearly correlated with temperature; maximum mean rates ranged from 40.1-124.1 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) in the summer with lower rates (<26.2 +/- 5.3 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) in the winter seasons. Direct denitrification was higher than coupled denitrification in all seasons. Denitrification rates were higher in WLD despite lower %OM, lower total N concentration, and higher BD in wetland soils. Therefore, in environments with low carbon availability, high denitrification rates can be sustained as long as NO3- concentrations are high (>30 mu M) and water temperature is >10 degrees C. In coastal Louisiana, substrates under these regimes are represented by emergent supra-tidal flats or land created by sediment diversions under oligohaline conditions (<1 ppt).

AB Restoration measures (ditch blocking, bund construction, etc.) were applied to a cutover part of the Boisdes-Bel (BdB) bog peatland in autumn 1999; since then a near complete cover of Sphagnum rubellum (similar to 15 cm) has developed over the old cutover peat, along with a suite of bog vegetation. This research assesses the restored site's (RES) hydrological condition after 10 growing seasons (May 15th-August 15th, 2010) through comparison with an adjacent unrestored site (UNR) and a natural site (NAT) located elsewhere in the peatland. Evapotranspiration (ET) from RES (242 mm) has not noticeably changed since the first 3 years post-restoration (2000-2002) still maintaining lower ET rates than UNR (290 mm). The highest ET occurred at NAT (329 mm), dissimilar to RES despite similar vegetation cover. UNR generates more runoff (37 mm) than RES (7 mm), similar to the initial assessments. However, since the initial assessments the average water table has continued to rise, from -35.3 (+/- 6.2) cm (2000-2002) to -27.3 (+/- 14.9) cm (2010) below the cutover peat surface but still fluctuates predominantly within the cutover peat and not the regenerated Sphagnum. The regenerated Sphagnum at RES has increased the surface elevation by similar to 15-20 cm, and with respect to its surface the average water table was at similar to-42.3 ( +/- 20.9) cm. However, its water table was still lower (and more variable) than at NAT (33.2 +/- 9.0 cm), with respect to the moss surface. Average soil water pressures in 2010 were similar to the early post-restoration condition at depths of 10 cm (-43.0 +/- 12.2 and -44.1 +/- 13.1 mb) and 20 cm (-41.4 +/- 13.0 and -40.6 +/- 10.5 mb) below the cutover surface at RES and UNR, respectively. Volumetric soil moisture contents (theta) at 2.5, 7.5 and 17.5 cm depths were higher in the Sphagnum moss at NAT (0.23, 0.31, and 0.71) compared to RES (0.12, 0.11, and 0.23), where the underlying cutover peat had a relatively high theta of 0.74. The low moisture content in the new moss overlying the relatively moist cutover peat indicates there was restricted connectivity between the two layers. Ten years following the implementation of restoration measures and the development of a near complete 15 cm thick Sphagnum moss layer, further time is required for the moss layer to develop (increase in thickness and bulk density, hence water retention capacity) and more consistently host the water table, so that the average water content more closely mimics NAT.

AB Biosolids are several forms of treated sewage sludge that are intended for use as soil conditioners for horticultural, agricultural and industrial crops. The objectives of this research were to determine the chemical and physical properties of biosolids pyrolyzed at several different temperatures, and their effect on perennial ryegrass seed germination and growth. Biosolids were thermally treated in an oxygen-free (nitrogen atmosphere) retort oven at 300, 400, 500, 700 and 900 degrees C. As pyrolysis temperatures increased, bulk densities, total surface areas, micropore surface areas, % minerals and pH values of the pyrolyzed biosolids increased, while carbon percentage decreased compared to untreated biosolids. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed decreased surface functionality as pyrolysis temperature increased. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L 'Nui') plants were grown in mixtures of 10% (v/v) biosolids or 10% (v/v) of the various pyrolyzed biosolids and 90% coarse sand. Ryegrass plants grown in the biosolids and the 300 C pyrolyzed biosolids mixture had the greatest shoot heights of any of the treatments after 4 weeks of growth. These results indicate that pyrolyzing biosolids at 300 C would produce material with excellent potential as a long-term peat replacement for water and nutrient retention in sand-based rootzones.

AB The usual method of restoring cut-over bogs is to rewet the peat surface. but this often leads to the remaining peat layers being deeply inundated. For Sphagnum-dominated vegetation to develop at deeply inundated locations. it is important for floating rafts of buoyant residual peat to develop. In this study. the chemical and physical characteristics of buoyant and inundated peat collected from rewetted cut-over bog were compared. In general. buoyant peat was poorly humified: high methane (CH4) production rates (greater than or equal to2 mumol g(-1) DW day(-1)) were important to ensure buoyancy. Although the peat water CH4 concentrations increased with depth. the CH4 production rates were higher in the uppermost peat layers. High CH4 production rates were related positively with P concentrations and negatively with lignin concentrations. The pH to bulk density ratio (greater than or equal to0.05) also appeared to be a good indicator of CH4 production rates, providing an easy and cheap way to measure. the variable for restoration practitioners. Our results indicated that analysing certain simple characteristics of the residual peat can greatly improve the success of the rewetting measures taken in cut-over bogs. If the analysis reveals that the residual peat is unsuitable for floating raft formation, deep inundation is inappropriate unless suitable peat from other locations can be introduced.

AB A comparison was made of Canadian sphagnum peat (SP) and Philippine coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) coir dust (CD) as growing media components for Dieffenbachia maculata [(Lodd.) G. Don] 'Camille' greenhouse production, Three soilless foliage plant growing mixes [Cornell, Hybrid, Univ. of Florida #2 (UF-2)] were prepared using either SP or CD and pine bark (PB), vermiculite (V), and/or perlite (P) in the following ratios (percent by volume): Cornell = 50 CD or SP:25 V:25 P, Hybrid = 40 CD or SP:30 V:30 PB, UF-2 = 50 CD or SP:50 PB, Initial Cl concentrations and electrical conductivities were higher for CD-containing media (CDM) than SP-containing media (SPR;I). At termination, Ca, Mg, and NO3-N concentrations were higher for SPM than CDM, Bulk densities were lower for CDM than SPM for one medium, but not for the others. Water-filled pore space (W-FPS) and water-holding capacity (W-HC) were larger and air-filled pore space (A-FPS) generally was smaller for CDM than SPM. Cornell had the highest W-FPS and W-HC, lowest A-FPS and percentage of large particles, and produced the highest grade and heaviest plants, Plant top grades, fresh mass and overall mass, but not root grades and mass, were higher for CDM than SPM, Plant mass was positively correlated with initial medium W-HC but not with A-FPS. Lower K in mix UF-2 compared to the mixes containing vermiculite may have been partly responsible for the lesser growth in that mix.

AB Boreal peatlands represent a globally important store of carbon, and disturbances such as wildfire can have a negative feedback to the climate. Understanding how carbon exchange and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics are impacted after a wildfire is important, especially as boreal peatlands may be vulnerable to changes in wildfire regime under a rapidly changing climate. However, given this vulnerability, there is very little in the literature on the impact such fires have on methane (CH4) emissions. This study investigated the effect of wildfire on CH4 emissions at a boreal fen near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, that was partially burned by the Horse River Wildfire in 2016. We measured CH4 emissions and environmental variables (20172018) and CH4 production potential (2018) in two different microform types (hummocks and hollows) across a peat burn severity gradient (unburned (UB), moderately burned (MB), and severely burned (SB)). Results indicated a switch in the typical understanding of boreal peatland CH4 emissions. For example, emissions were significantly lower in the MB and SB hollows in both years compared to UB hollows. Interestingly, across the burned sites, hummocks had higher fluxes in 2017 than hollows at the MB and SB sites. We found typically higher emissions at the UB site where the water table was close to the surface. However, at the burned sites, no relationship was found between CH4 emissions and water table, even under similar hydrological conditions. There was also significantly higher CH4 production potential from the UB site than the burned sites. The reduction in CH4 emissions and production in the hollows at burned sites highlights the sensitivity of hollows to fire, removing labile organic material for potential methanogenesis. The previously demonstrated resistance of hummocks to fire also results in limited impact on CH4 emissions and likely faster recovery to pre-fire rates. Given the potential initial net cooling effect resulting from a reduction in CH4 emissions, it is important that the radiative effect of all GHGs following wildfire across peatlands is taken into account.

AB Peat soils are heterogeneous, anisotropic porous media. Compared to mineral soils, there is still limited understanding of physical and solute transport properties of fen peat soils. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of soil anisotropy on solute transport in degraded fen peat. Undisturbed soil cores, taken in vertical and horizontal direction, were collected from one drained and one restored fen peatland both in a comparable state of soil degradation. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K- s) and chemical properties of peat were determined for all soil cores. Miscible displacement experiments were conducted under saturated steady state conditions using potassium bromide as a conservative tracer. The results showed that (1) the K- s in vertical direction (K- sv) was significantly higher than that in horizontal direction (K-sh), indicating that K- s of degraded fen peat behaves anisotropically; (2) pronounced preferential flow occurred in vertical direction with a higher immobile water fraction and a higher pore water velocity; (3) the 5% arrival time (a proxy for the strength of preferential flow) was affected by soil anisotropy as well as study site. A strong correlation was found between 5% arrival time and dispersivity, K- s and mobile water fraction; (4) phosphate release was observed from drained peat only. The impact of soil heterogeneity on phosphate leaching was more pronounced than soil anisotropy. The soil core with the strongest preferential flow released the highest amount of phosphate. We conclude that soil anisotropy is crucial in peatland hydrology but additional research is required to fully understand anisotropy effects on solute transport.

AB The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) is vital to agricultural and environmental management, and its variation is influenced by environmental factors operating at different scales and intensities. The objective of this study was to explore the scale-dependent effects of environmental factors on SOC distribution and to predict SOC based on their scale-specific relationships using wavelet transform. The spatial data of SOC, slope, soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), sand, silt, and Landsat 8 remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were extracted at 330 m interval along three transects in the arable land of Taiyuan basin, China. The spatial series of SOC and environmental variables along each of three transects were separated into six detail components and one approximation representing different scales using wavelet decomposition. The specific scale of each detail component was identified by Hilbert transform. The SOC variances over the entire basin were mainly explained (54%-86%) by scales of 12.70 and 21.12 km. Compared with the relationships between SOC and environmental factors at sampling scale, their multiscale correlations were better at larger scales. The SOC estimation using wavelet reconstruction based on predicted SOC at all scale components outperformed its prediction using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) based on the original sampling data. The major contributing scale to SOC prediction was 12.70 km over the entire basin. In the prediction of overall SOC, Rrs was the major predictor in the upstream and downstream portions, whereas soil texture was the major contributor in the midstream portion. In this study, the SOC prediction using wavelet transform based on scale-dependent relationships with environmental variables generated new insights in soil properties estimation, and wavelet transform has potential for determining the multiscale relationships of soil properties with influencing factors.

AB Forms, amounts, and accumulation of soil phosphorus (P) were measured in natural and recently restored marshes surrounding Upper Klamath Lake located in south-central Oregon, USA to determine rates of P accumulation in natural marshes and to assess changes in P pools caused by long-term drainage in recently restored marshes. Soil cores were collected from three natural marshes and radiometrically dated to determine recent (Cs-137-based) and long-term (Pb-210-based) rates of peat accretion and P accumulation. A second set of soil cores collected from the three natural marshes and from three recently restored marshes was analyzed using a modification of the Hedley procedure to determine the forms and amounts of soil P. Total P in the recently restored marshes (222 to 311 mu g cm(-3)) was 2-3 times greater than in the natural marshes (103 to 117 mu g cm(-3)), primarily due to greater bulk density caused by soil subsidence, a consequence of long-term marsh drainage. Occluded Fe- and Al-bound P-i, calcium-bound P-i and residual P were 4 times, 22 times, and 5 times greater, respectively, in the recently restored marshes. More than 67% of the P pool in both the natural and recently restored marshes was present in recalcitrant forms (humic-acid P-o and residual P) that provide long-term P storage in peat. Phosphorus accumulation in the natural marshes averaged 0.45 g m(-2) yr(-1) (Cs-137) and 0.40 g m(-2) yr(-1) (Pb-210), providing a benchmark for optimizing P sequestration in the recently restored marshes. Effective P sequestration in the recently restored marshes, however, will depend on re-establishing equilibrium between the P-enriched soils and the P concentration of floodwaters and a hydrologic regime similar to the natural marshes.

AB Oxygen microsensors were used to determine oxygen profiles in situ from the top to the bottom layer of the growing medium for potted plants of Rosa sp. 'Dior'. The growing medium was peat- based and compacted uniformly to 3 different bulk densities of 0.14, 0.18 and 0.23 g cm(-3) (0.20 and 40% compacted, respectively). The water distribution in the pot was determined as water content (g cm(-3)) in the top, middle and bottom layers of the peat. Oxygen content was also determined after a standard subirrigation cycle and after excessive irrigation where the bottom of the pots were left waterlogged for 24 h. Measurements were carried out at 5.5 weeks during the production phase and at 12 weeks at the end of the production. The results showed that with increasing compaction and density, more water was transported to the upper layers of the pot. After a standard irrigation cycle there was no effect of the level of medium compaction on the oxygen distribution, whereas after excessive irrigation, the oxygen contents at the bottom of the pots were strongly reduced and the level of compaction significantly affected oxygen availability. The most compacted medium had the lowest oxygen content at 5.5 weeks, with anoxic conditions in the bottom 30 mm. Plant quality measured as fresh weight, dry weight, height and number of shoots with flowers and buds was not affected by the different levels of compaction. The use of oxygen microsensors provided a new insight into the spatial and temporal distribution of oxygen in growing media and how this was affected by the physical characteristics of the growing media.

AB The Ore Mountains were one of the important flood source areas for several heavy floods over the last years. Reducing damages caused by floods demands sufficient information on the runoff generation processes in the catchments. The aim of this study is to provide insights into prevailing flow pathways, retention times and threshold behavior of a representative hillslope catchment with layered subsurface in the Ore Mountains. The study site is a forested headwater with gneiss as bedrock. We used hydrometrical methods, soil temperature data and sprinkler experiments. Results indicate that the hydraulic anisotropic structure of the deepest layer in 0.9-1.7 m depth is the major controlling factor for subsurface water flow paths. On one hand, this layer acts as an aquitard for seeping water because of its high bulk density. On the other hand, water within the layer is able to flow laterally because of the sandy texture and coarse clasts oriented parallel to the slope. Moreover, three pre-moisture controlled types of runoff processes were addressed. With low antecedent soil moisture, saturation overland flow dominates in the spring bog. With intermediate or high pre-moisture, interflow is generated. The measured runoff coefficients increase in a nonlinear manner with rising pre-moisture. A soil water tension threshold value near field capacity is the tipping point for nonlinear runoff response. These findings emphasize the impact of the layered structure of the subsurface and of antecedent soil moisture for runoff generation in low mountain ranges and may be useful for establishing flood warning systems.

AB Soil strength estimates from shear vane, Proctor and drop cone penetrometer were obtained alongside cohesion and angle of internal friction measured with the triaxial test. Two organic materials (peat and farmyard manure) were incorporated at the rates of 0%, 4%, 8% and 12% to two soils (one sandy loam and the other clay), and compacted with 25 blows of the Proctor hammer. For the shear vane and the penetrometers, the soils were tested at moisture contents ranging from 5% to 55%, while for the triaxial tests, the soils were tested at three moisture states (5% below optimum, optimum and 5% above optimum moisture content). Although organic matter addition decreases soil strength of compacted soils at lower moisture contents, the effect decreases as moisture content increases, and there is a small increase in strength at the highest moisture contents. Organic matter decreased the strength of the soils at the three moisture states by decreasing the angle of friction rather than soil cohesion. Proctor penetrometer strength estimates were the highest followed by those from the drop cone, shear vane and the triaxial test. The shear vane overestimated the cohesion in the soil when compared with the triaxial test measurement. The penetration resistance measured with the Proctor and the drop cone penetrometers were correlated as were the shear strength measurements from the triaxial and the shear vane instrument. The Proctor penetrometer was the quickest to use, followed by the drop cone penetrometer, shear vane and the triaxial test. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim We test the hypothesis that the European destruction of western Tasmanian Aboriginal society, and consequent changes in burning patterns, resulted in succession towards rain forest near the coast, and an increase in the area of more fire-resistant sedgeland in inland areas. Location South-western and western Tasmania, Australia. Methods Attributes of organic soils (surface and underlying dominant horizons) beneath rain forest and sedgeland were described and measured from 559 soil pits in areas with highly siliceous surface geology. Multiple logistic regression was used to discriminate the dominant horizons of rain forest and sedgeland soils. This equation was used to derive scores for all soil pits. The hypothesis that change was greater near existing boundaries was tested using correlation. The hypothesis that change was greater at coastal than inland locations was tested using ANOVA. Results Both upper horizons of the soils under the fire-sensitive rain forest (14C-dated to be younger than 60 years) and dominant horizons of these soils had significantly higher organic contents, lower bulk density and more nitrogen than the soils under the fire-requiring sedgeland. Twenty-nine per cent of the soils under sedgeland had dominant horizons that indicated past rain forest. One-quarter of the soils under rain forest had dominant horizons characteristic of sedgeland soils. Although results were heterogeneous in both locations, the former difference was more common inland and the latter near the coast. Change was not higher close to present boundaries. Main conclusions The characteristics of the dominant horizons and the post-colonial surface horizon give a strong indication of the vegetation that formed them. Changes in fire regimes, caused by the displacement of Tasmanian Aborigines by Europeans, appear to have caused vegetation changes that differed within and between the coast and inland areas. Thus, there has been a strong human role in determining the distributions of vegetation types in the region.

AB A comparative study on the suitability of one compost and two vermicomposts, obtained from the same batch of tomato-crop waste, as growth media for ornamental plant production was carried out. Each material was mixed with Sphagnum peat at 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100 (peat control) proportions by volume. Two ornamentals (Calendula officinalis, Viola cornuta) were sown and grown in the 13 substrates. Substrates were characterized physically and chemically. Seed germination, total leaf chlorophyll (SPAD units), plant growth, and plant nutrient concentrations were determined. The compost and the vermicomposts were markedly different from peat. Compost and the vermicomposts had greater bulk density and lower total porosity than peat. Compost had larger aeration and lower water-holding capacity than vermicomposts and peat. Compost and vermicomposts were alkaline (pH = 8.8 on average) whilst peat was acidic (pH = 5.9). Electrical conductivity was low in peat (0.23 dS m(-1)) and vermicomposts (0.65 dS m(-1)), and high in compost (2.85 dS m(-1)) due to the high concentrations of K+ and SO42-. Mixing compost and vermicomposts with peat produced substrates with intermediate characteristics. Physical properties were within adequate range for all mixes except for the compost ones. pH was within adequate range only in pure peat, and salinity was extremely high in the compost mixes. Compost was phytotoxic, as shown by the strong reduction of seed germination, chlorophyll content, and plant growth of both ornamentals. Vermicomposts did not affect seed germination but reduced plant growth, though much less than compost. Mixing these materials with peat improved germination and growth. The diluted materials (compost at the 25 : 75 and vermicomposts at the 50 : 50 and 25 : 75 proportions) produced good-quality plants.

TI Modeling moisture retention in peat soils
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

ID HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; UNSATURATED SOILS; CONDUCTIVITY
AB Soil moisture governs many biogeochemical processes in peatlands. Modeling of those processes relative to climate and anthropogenic influences requires knowledge of the basic hydraulic properties of different peat soils in a function form. Water retention of undisturbed surface peat samples, collected at four depths at each of 38 undrained and drained pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) mire sites, was measured for suction pressures of -0.98, -3.10, -6.19, -9.81, -98.1, and -1554.25 kPa, The obtained data were used to test several well-known water retention models commonly applied to mineral soils, The most suitable model was found to be van Genuchten's model if the residual water content was omitted. Feat characteristics were used to explain the variation in the model's shape parameters. Accounting for the remains of Sphagnum, Carer, Eriophorum, and lignin and the distinction between shallow and deep peat layers considerably improved the moisture retention predictions compared with using bulk density only. The different behavior of the shallow vs. the deep peat layers was mainly attributed to the Sphagnum and lignin residues, but not to the Carer residues. We developed a semiempirical model with only one shape parameter, which was clearly better explained by the peat characteristics than the two shape parameters of the van Genuchten model, We recommend that for statistical investigations or investigations requiring a robust model. the semiempirical model be used. The van Genuchten model is to be preferred in predicting the moisture conditions near saturation.

AB Radioactive markers are useful in dating lead deposition patterns from industrialization in peat archive. Peat cores were collected in an ombrotrophic peat bog in the Great Hinggan Mountains in Northeast China in September 2008 and dated using Pb-210 and Cs-137 radiometric techniques. The mosses in both cores were examined systematically for dry bulk density, water and ash content. Lead also was measured using atomic emission spectroscopy with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-AES). Both patterned peat profiles were preserved well without evident anthropogenic disturbance. Unsupported Pb-210 and Cs-137 decreased with the depth in both of the two sample cores. The Pb-210 chronologies were established using the constant rate of supply model (CRS) and are in good agreement with the Cs-137 time marker. Recent atmospheric Pb-210 flux in Great Hinggan Mountains peat bog was estimated to be 337 Bq m(-2) y(-1), which is consistent with published data for the region. Lead deposition rate in this region was also derived from these two peat cores and ranged from 24.6 to 55.8 mg m(-2) y(-1) with a range of Pb concentration of 14-262 mu g g(-1). The Pb deposition patterns were consistent with increasing industrialization over the last 135-170 y, with a peak of production and coal burning in the last 50 y in Northeast China. This work presents a first estimation of atmospheric Pb deposition rate in peatlands in China and suggests an increasing trend of environmental pollution due to anthropogenic contaminants in the atmosphere. More attention should be paid to current local pollution problems, and society should take actions to seek a balance between economic development and environmental protection. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   BEHAVIOR; MODELS; PROBES
AB Time domain reflectometry (TDR), while widely used to measure volumetric water content (theta) and bulk electrical conductivity (BEC) in unsaturated granular soils, remains less studied in peat than mineral soils. Empirical models commonly used in mineral soils are not applicable to peat for accurate determination of theta from measured apparent dielectric permittivity (epsilon). Past studies for peat report highly variable calibrations, and suggest differences in origin of organic matter, degree of decomposition and bound water to explain such variability. This study shows that bound water appears to have minimal impact on calibration because of its negligible volumetric fraction at the low bulk densities of peat. Increased volumetric air fraction at the same theta values attributed to high porosity of peat makes the epsilon-theta relationships of mineral soils inapplicable. Temperature effects on e resulted in a correction factor for theta. The temperature correction factor decreased with decreasing theta and was determined experimentally to lie between -0.0021 m(3) m(-3) per degrees C for theta >= 0.79 m(3) m(-3) and -0.0005 m(3) m(-3) per degrees C for theta = 0.35 m(3) m(-3). The decreasing value of the correction factor with theta can be explained by dependence of the epsilon-theta relationship on properties of free water alone. Temperature dependence of BEC was close to that of soil solution. Maxwell-De Loor's four-phase mixing model (MDL) based on physical properties of the multiphase soil system can efficiently simulate the effect of increased air volume and varying soil temperature on the epsilon-theta relationship in peat. In addition, linear epsilon-theta calibration in peat can be improved when BEC is included in the calibration equation.

AB The major bog systems in northern areas are dominated by Sphagnum species, the partially decomposed remains of which form the bulk of deep peat. By adding mono- and di-valent cations to deep peat cores (2.0-2.5 m) and measuring CH4 and CO2 concentrations in the manipulated peat cores using quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) we demonstrate that the lack of availability to microorganisms of essential cations is limiting decay in deep peat. The cations with the highest binding strength displaced the most cations and stimulated decay. Decay in deep peat cores was also stimulated by a C source (acetate), but not by NH4+. The addition of cations and acetate resulted in a less than additive stimulation of decay. The stimulatory effect of acetate and copper decreased in the presence of ammonium. The addition of EDTA to surface bog peat (where cations are conserved) decreased decay rates in surface peat (0.0-0.5 m) to that of the untreated deep peat (2.0-2.5 m). Deep peat was unaffected by treatment with EDTA. The effect of adding Cu2+ differed with the depth from which the peat was collected. Cu2+ did not stimulate decay in surface bog peat (0.0-1.5 m) but stimulated decay in peat from 1.5-3.5 m. Below 3.5 m to the bottom of the profile (5.0 m) no positive effect was observed. By comparing deep peat with surface peat we have shown that cation limitation because of high cation exchange capacity is specific to the main mass of deep bog peat and may explain differences in decay rates between anoxic surface peat and deep peat.

AB Soil irrigation with wastewater (WW) gives the opportunity to solve the problems of its disposal, final purification or reuse. Many studies have examined mineral soils upon continued WW application. The aim of this paper was to examine the properties of organic soils 3 years after WW application was discontinued. Peat-muck soil planted with Populus spp. or Salix spp., and mineral-muck soil under grasses were irrigated for 4 years with municipal WW at a low (comparable with intensive NPK fertilization) and high WW rate (600 and 1200 mm yearly, respectively). Soils were analysed for organic matter (OM), pH, bulk density (BD), water holding capacity (WHC), P(2)O(5), Fe(2)O(3), Al(2)O(3), MnO, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, magnetic susceptibility (MS) and dehydrogenase and catalase activities. The results were compared with control soils which have never received WW. The study showed that only P(2)O(5), MnO and catalase activity (CA) were significantly affected by former WW application. On average, P(2)O(5) increased by 30 per cent, whereas MnO decreased by 35 per cent with no differences between the two WW rates. CA decreased by 18 per cent at the high WW rate. Most of tested characteristics were determined by soil type. The peat-muck soil showed higher OM, WHC, P(2)O(5), MnO, Pb and CA than mineral-muck soil and lower BD, MS, Fe(2)O(3), Al(2)O(3) and Cr. Soil depth influenced Fe(2)O(3), MnO, Zn, MS and enzyme activities, while basic soil properties (OM, pH, BD, WHC and P2O5) were not changed by soil depth. Heavy metals (Zn, Cr, Cu and Pb) were below upper permissible limits. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Northern boreal peatlands are major terrestrial sinks of organic carbon and these ecosystems, which are highly sensitive to human activities and climate change, act as sensitive archives of past environmental change at various timescales. This study aims at understanding how the climate changes of the last 1000 years have affected peatland vegetation dynamics in the boreal region of Alberta in western Canada. Peat cores were collected from five bogs in the Fort McMurray region (56-57 degrees N), at the southern limit of sporadic permafrost, and two in central Alberta (53 N and 55 N) outside the present-day limit of permafrost peatlands. The past changes in vegetation communities were reconstructed using detailed plant macrofossil analyses combined with high-resolution peat chronologies (C-14, atmospheric bomb pulse C-14, Pb-210 and cryptotephras). Peat humification proxies (C/N, HNC, bulk density) and records of pH and ash content were also used to improve the interpretation of climate-related vegetation changes. Our study shows important changes in peatland vegetation and physical and chemical peat properties during the Little Ice Age (LIA) cooling period mainly from around 1700 CE and the subsequent climate warming of the 20th century. In some bogs, the plant macrofossils have recorded periods of permafrost aggradation during the LIA with drier surface conditions, increased peat humification and high abundance of ericaceous shrubs and black spruce (Picea mariana). The subsequent permafrost thaw was characterized by a short-term shift towards wetter conditions (Sphagnum sect. Cuspidata) and a decline in Picea mariana. Finally, a shift to a dominance of Sphagnum sect. Acutifolia (mainly Sphagnum fuscum) occurred in all the bogs during the second half of the 20th century, indicating the establishment of dry ombrotrophic conditions under the recent warmer and drier climate conditions.

AB The physical and hydrological conditions in extracted peatlands often act as barriers to the regeneration of the keystone peat-forming genus Sphagnum. Although previous work has suggested that Sphagnum mosses regenerating on cutover peat surfaces quickly become vulnerable to water stress as the thickness of the regenerated layer increases, uncertainties regarding the storage and transmission properties of this layer and how these might evolve over time have made this assertion difficult to evaluate. This study investigates the hydrophysical properties and hydrological behaviour of regenerating Sphagnum layers ranging from 3 to 43years in age using both field and laboratory methods. The >40-year-old regenerated layers had significantly (p<0.001) higher bulk density and retention capacity in the 5-cm-thick basal layer directly overlying the cutover peat than the newer (<10year old) regenerated layers. Capillarity was a much stronger control on surficial water content () than precipitation, which was poorly retained in the Sphagnum canopy, suggesting that regulation of water table position is an effective method of controlling as a means of optimizing productivity. In general, the sustained at a given water table position decreased as regenerated layer thickness increased. Analysis of water table position relative to the former cutover peat surface in different areas of the site suggests that the soil water dynamics of the >40-year-old regenerated layers may be becoming increasingly similar to those of a natural bog peatland.

AB The net accumulation of remains of Sphagnum spp. is fundamental to the development of many peatlands. The effect of polyphenols from Sphagnum on decomposition processes is frequently cited but has barely been studied. The central area of the Rodmossamyran peatland (Sweden) is an open lawn that consists mostly of Sphagnum spp. with a very low contribution from vascular plants. In order to determine the effects of decay on sphagnum phenols, 53 samples of a 2.7 m deep core from this lawn were analysed with pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC-MS) and compared with more traditional decomposition proxies such as C/N ratio, UV light transmission of alkaline peat extracts, and bulk density. Factor analysis of 72 quantified pyrolysis products suggested that the variation in 4-isopropenylphenol was largely determined by aerobic decomposition instead of Sphagnum abundance. In order to evaluate the effects of aerobic decay in Sphagnum peat, down-core records from different climatic regions were compared using molecular markers for plant biopolymers and C/N ratio. These included markers for lignin from vascular plants ((di) methoxyphenols), polyphenols from Sphagnum spp. (4-isopropenylphenol), and cellulose (levoglucosan). Our results indicate that polyphenols from Sphagnum are preferentially degraded over polysaccharides; consequently the variability of the marker for sphagnum acid, 4-isopropenylphenol, was found indicative of decomposition instead of reflecting the abundance of Sphagnum remains. The fact that 4-isopropenylphenol is aerobically degraded in combination with its specificity for Sphagnum spp. makes it a consistent indicator of past hydrological conditions in Sphagnum-dominated peat. In contrast, the variability of C/N records in Sphagnum-dominated peat was influenced by both vegetation shifts and decomposition, and the dominant effect differed between the studied peatlands. Our results provide direction for modelling studies that try to predict possible feedback mechanisms between peatlands and future climate change, and indicate that the focus in Sphagnum decay studies should be on carbohydrates rather than on phenolic compounds.

AB In the boreal plains ecozone, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) peatlands can represent large parts of the expanding wildland-urban interface (WUI) and wildland-industry interface (WII). The boreal plains wildfire regime is predicted to increase in areal extent and intensity, amplifying the need for wildfire management to protect the WUI and WII. Forested peatland ecosystems can burn at high intensity and present challenges for wildfire managers such as severe smouldering combustion and large carbon loss. Fuel management techniques such as mulching treatments (converting surface and canopy fuel to a masticated fuelbed) can be applied to black spruce peatlands, yet the impact on fuel load, condition, and peat burn severity is unclear. Using observations from an experimental fire, we found that a mulch-thinning fuel treatment could reduce peat depth of burn. However, where peat bulk density was increased by compaction, this led to an increased peat combustion carbon loss relative to the control. Furthermore, near-total combustion of the mulch layer resulted in significantly more surface fuel carbon emission from thinned and stripped fuel-treated areas compared with the control. We argue that although fuel treatment may benefit smouldering combustion suppression efforts, surface fuel carbon loss should be considered before treatments are implemented on a large scale.

AB This study examines changes in peat volume in a mined peatland near Lac St Jean, Quebec, during the spring and summer of 1995 and 1996, and the implication for water storage changes. Lowering of the water table caused drainage above the water table, but the specific yield (S-y) of the peat was relatively small (0.48), and did not adequately describe the water storage change. Lowering of the water table also caused surface subsidence, which was shown to be partly due to shrinkage above the water table (<3.6 cm), and partly due to compression of the saturated peat (about 6 cm). Measured total surface subsidence ranged from 6.5 to 10 cm. The change in pear volume occurred over the entire depth of the peat deposit (b), and so the storativity due to peat compression (bS(s)), estimated to be 0.13, was more important than specific yield in determining water storage changes. Total storativity (S-tot) was best estimated as the sum S-y + bS(s).
   Changes in peat volume in the 0-3 cm layer were evident in the temporally variable bulk density (83-101 kg m(-3)). Its relationship with Volumetric moisture content was highly hysteretic, reflecting the complexity of the process in the unsaturated zone. However, there was a linear relationship with water tension, suggesting a more direct causal relationship. Changes in pest volume were also recorded below the water table, as the volumetric water content of the saturated peat decreased by 3.5% over the season. Since this applied to a relatively thick layer of peat, its total effect was greater than shrinkage in the zone above the water table. It was concluded that most peatland water balances should make account of storage changes associated with peat Volume changes, and that peat volume changes may increase the water limitations to plants when the water table drops below the surface.

AB Changes in hydrological conditions are expected and may alter carbon cycling in peatlands. Peat aeration with water table change has not commonly been investigated, and the water table is often assumed to constitute the oxic-anoxic boundary in peat. We analyzed temperature, moisture, oxygen (O-2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in profiles of a temperate fen during two seasons. A drying-rewetting cycle and flooding were induced and compared to controls. The response of moisture and water table position varied greatly and was related to gradients of peat compaction and ash content. Background drought raised air-filled porosity (AFP) to a maximum of 15%-38% in shallow peat and experimental drought up to 50%. Decline in water table and soil moisture broadly led to O-2 penetration and CO2 degassing, and rewetting and flooding led to anoxic conditions and CO2 accumulation in peat pore water. In dense peat with >= 20% ash content the unsaturated zone remained partly low in oxygen, however, and up to 5% AFP and 20 cm above water table O-2 concentrations frequently remained below 50 mu mol L-1. Moderately intense and short drying did not induce substantial oxygen penetration in the compacted soil profiles. The likelihood of the presence of oxygen in the peat was predicted by logistic regression using water table and ash content or bulk density as predictors (p < 0.0005). The model is potentially useful for predicting the position of the redoxcline in peat deposits and may assist in improving statistical models of trace gas emission from peatlands.

AB By examining the area of the Sarobetsu Mire in northern Japan using ALOS/PALSAR data, we have clarified the backscattering behavior and characteristics of the L-band microwaves when used in the study of peatlands. We classified the vegetation into six categories and noted the differences in scattering intensity and incident-angle dependencies among these. The scattering intensity for HH and HV polarizations was greatest with sasa (dwarf bamboo) and reeds, and least with sphagnum. The incident-angle dependency with the HH polarization was higher for sasa and reed than for other vegetation types. Analysis of the polarization revealed that such differences among vegetation classes were reflected most clearly in the volume scattering characteristic. Applying simple and multiple regression analysis for the environmental factors of soil, hydrology, vegetation, and roughness against the backscatter coefficient, we also found stronger interrelations with soil factors such as bulk density, nitrogen and carbon content, and C/N ratio, and against the backscatter coefficient, than with either the roughness or vegetation. Based on such results, we clarified the unique scattering characteristics of peatlands in which scattering from the surface soil is more marked than that from other elements. We consequently estimated the spatial distribution of surface soil characteristics in peatland using the combined data available from L-band satellite SAR, aircraft laser (airborne LiDAR), and optical sensors.

AB Two peat cores from the Store Mosse mire in the central part of South Sweden have been analyzed for dry bulk density, carbon, and nitrogen. They cover the development of the peat mound from the time of the conversion of the initial fen to an ombrotrophic bog at 5450 BP through three different bog stages, the Fuscum, the Rubellum-Fuscum and the Magellanicum bog stages, each one characterized by a specific macrofossil assemblage.
   All N supplied to the bog surface is assumed to be contained in the organic matter. At the beginning of the Magellanicum bog stage, 1000 BP, the nitrogen accumulation rate increased from an earlier value of ca 0.4 g m(-2) yr(-1) to 0.8 g m(-2) yr(-1). These accumulation rates for N have been used to establish time scales for the periods between the C-14-datings.
   The estimated litter deposition rate in the hummocks is 120 g m(-2) yr(-1) in the two older bog stages and 270 g m(-2) yr(-1) in the Magellanicum bog stage. The decay losses in the acrotelm increased, as a proportion of the addition, with time through each one of the bog stages. The rang of variation in the cores for the acrotelm decay losses was 25-80%, and the annual input of organic matter to the catotelm, 30-130 g m(-2). These ranges are greater than those found among recent bog hummocks in NW Europe and North America. The decay losses during 5000 yr in the catotelm may not have exceeded 20% of the original input. The over-all net rate of accumulation of C was highest, ca 40 g m(-2) yr(-1), at the beginning of the Fuscum bog stage.
   The changes in the macrofossil assemblages are all associated with rapid increases in the peat accumulation rate, but decreases in accumulation rate are not. At the conversion from fen to bog the increased input of organic matter to the catotelm depended on expansion of Sphagnum fuscum which formed a decay resistant litter. Later increases depended on rapid rises of the mean water table, resulting in shorter residence times and smaller decay lasses from the acrotelm. The periods of decreases in input of organic matter to the catotelm depended on longer residence times in the acrotelm when the water table fell relative to the bog surface. However, comparisons with recent conditions suggest that the variation in mean water level relative to the surface may not have exceeded 10-15 cm.

AB Peat is used as rooting medium in greenhouse horticulture. Biochar is a sustainable alternative for the use of peat, which will reduce peat derived carbon dioxide emissions. Biochar in potting soil mixtures allegedly increases water storage, nutrient supply, microbial life and disease suppression but this depends on feedstock and the production process. The aim of this paper is to find combinations of feedstock and production circumstances which will deliver biochars with value for the horticultural end user. Low-temperature (600 degrees C-750 degrees C) gasification was used for combined energy and biochar generation. Biochars produced were screened in laboratory tests and selected biochars were used in plant experiments. Tests included dry bulk density, total pore space, specific surface area, phytotoxicity, pH, EC, moisture characteristics and microbial stability. We conclude that biochars from nutrient-rich feedstocks are too saline and too alkaline to be applied in horticultural rooting media. Biochars from less nutrient-rich feedstocks can be conveniently neutralized by mixing with acid peat. The influence of production parameters on specific surface area, pH, total pore space and toxicity is discussed. Biochar mildly improved the survival of beneficial micro-organisms in a mix with peat. Overall, wood biochar can replace at least 20% v/v of peat in potting soils without affecting plant growth.

ID CONIFER PLANTATIONS; PEATLANDS
AB Some impacts of 28-year-old South Coastal lodgepole pine forest on adjacent open blanket bog were investigated. A general rise in ground level in unplanted areas between 1966 and 1987 had been cancelled out by subsidence over most of the area by 1996. The forest plots had subsided by 40-80 cm since planting, depending on the cultivation/drainage treatment used and had an increased peat dry bulk density (0.13 Mg m(-3)) and a decreased water content (7 kg kg(-1) dry matter) compared with points more than 50 m from the forest (0.06-0.11 Mg m(-3) and 9-16 kg kg(-1) dry matter). The depth to water table in July averaged 55 cm in the forest but only 20 cm outside.
   The zone outside the forest affected by subsidence averaged 30 m wide in 1996, compared with 10-20 m in 1987, suggesting that by the end of the first rotation a 40-m wide zone will be affected. The development of a slope outside the forest by subsidence was considered to be a consequence of more rapid run-off and seepage towards the forest, rather than root spread onto the bog. Where pool systems or other vulnerable habitats are surrounded by forest, a buffer zone at least 40 m wide is needed between the edge of the habitat and the edge of the forest to safeguard the habitat during the first rotation. A narrower buffer zone may be sufficient in higher rainfall areas.

AB Understanding the processes controlling peatland carbon (C) sequestration is critical to anticipate potential changes in the global C cycle in response to climate change. Although identification of these factors may be relatively straightforward on seasonal timescales, at centennial to millennial timescales complexities arise because of interactions between climate, vegetation, hydrology and long-term ecological processes. To better understand the factors controlling long-term C accumulation, Holocene rates of C sequestration were quantified from three pristine ombrotrophic peatlands in boreal Quebec, northeastern Canada (52 degrees N, 75-76 degrees W). Bulk density and loss-on-ignition analyses, combined with radiocarbon dating and age-depth modelling, were used to estimate long-term apparent rates of carbon accumulation. Past changes in vegetation and water-table depth were obtained from plant macrofossil and testate amoeba analysis. Earliest regional peat accumulation started similar to 7520 cal. BP, with long-term rates of C sequestration varying between 14.9 and 22.6 g/m(2) per yr. High C sequestration rates occurred during the mid Holocene when relatively stable Sphagnum section Acutifolia communities were present, while low rates were found during the cooler late Holocene when Cyperaceae and ligneous vegetation were more dominant. However, C sequestration was highly variable among cores, implying that local topography, geomorphology and hydrology, or disturbance factors such as fire, mediate the influence of climate on C accumulation. Reconstructed water-table depths reveal several dry shifts since 3000 cal. BP, suggesting that episodic cold and dry conditions during the late Holocene may have contributed to lower C sequestration rates. Given the intensity of the water-table shifts at these times, we hypothesize that recurrent episodes of frozen subsurface peat might have intensified surface drying. As projected by climate scenarios, anticipated warmer and wetter conditions may lead to greater stability of hummock Sphagna cover and increased C sequestration potential in boreal peatlands.

AB Eucalyptus is one of the most widespread genera around the world and a key element in recent wildfires. In a Eucalyptus forest, the accumulation of litter builds up a ground fuel layer that can support both flaming and smouldering wildfires. This work investigates the smouldering wildfire on leaf, bark, and twig beds (bulk density: 70-140 kg/m(3)) of Eucalyptus species. Two-stage smouldering spread processes are observed. The first-stage smouldering fire has the peak temperature of 600 degrees C-700 degrees C and spread rate of 5-9 mm/min. The measured emission factors are 1000-1500 g/kg (CO2), 180-450 g/kg (CO), 9-16 g/kg (CH4), and 2-6 g/kg (H2), respectively. The CO/CO2 ratio ranges from 0.15 (leaf) to 0.8 (bark). Laboratory experiments demonstrate that the smouldering fire spread is slower in leaf than those in bark and twig. The burning of stringy barks is less complete, compared to smooth barks. For leaf and twig beds, the influence of Eucalyptus species and heating value on smouldering fire is negligible. This is the first work to reveal smouldering fire behaviors on different Eucalyptus litter fuels and provides valuable information for understanding the effects of Eucalyptus species and plant parts on smouldering combustion.

AB The purpose of this research was to investigate the efficiency of Dracaena marginata planted biofilters to decontaminate urban runoff. A new biofilter growth substrate was prepared using low-cost and locally available materials such as red soil, fine sand, perlite, vermiculite, coco-peat and Sargassum biomass. The performance of biofilter substrate was compared with local garden soil based on physical and water quality parameters. Preliminary analyses indicated that biofilter substrate exhibited desirable characteristics such as low bulk density (1140 kg/m(3)), high water holding capacity (59.6%), air-filled porosity (7.82%) and hydraulic conductivity (965 mm/h). Four different biofilter assemblies, with vegetated and non-vegetated systems, were examined for several artificial rain events (un-spiked and metal-spiked). Results from un-spiked artificial rain events suggested that concentrations of most of the chemical components in effluent were highest at the beginning of rain events and thereafter subsided during the subsequent rain events. Biofilter growth substrate showed superior potential over garden soil to retain metal ions such as Al, Fe, Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb during metal-spiked rain events. Significant differences were also observed between non-vegetated and vegetated biofilter assemblies in runoff quality, with the latter producing better results.

AB Coconut coir dust amended in substrate had effects on water use and some growth in potted marigolds (Tagetes erecta 'Antigua Yellow'). This study was performed to clarify the effect of coir dust amended in substrate media on water use efficiency and nutrient leaching in potted marigold. 'Antigua Yellow' seeds were sown in peat moss to develop 2 pairs of true leaf, then seedlings were randomly transplanted into 15 cm plastic pots containing soilless mix media (40% rice husk charcoal, 20% rice husk, 20% sand and 20% compost leaves; by volume) and followed by coconut coir dust amended treatments with 0, 25, 50 and 75% (v/v). The results exhibited that all amended coconut treatments could improve the physical properties of mix media by decreasing the estimated bulk density, but increased the total porosity (A) and water filled pore (A). Fifty percent con-dust treatment seems to reduce accumulated El', crops evapotranspiration (ETc) and transpiration per leaf area unit per day. Hence, 50% coir dust portion gave the highest water use efficiency (WHE) and the lowest crop co-efficient (Kc) parameter. Nevertheless, 75% coir dust portion also reduced some nutrient leachate in the runoff solution; nitrate (NO3) leachate at early growth stage and phosphate leachate (PO43-) at flowering and senescence. Positive correlation was observed between total leachate volume and total phosphate concentration leachate (R= 0.98). Almost all plant growth parameters had diverse responses during the comparison of each different coconut con dust portion, but flowering yield (total FW and total number) wrere prone to be promoted by 75% coir dust treatment.

AB Sphagnum moss, a dominant peat-forming species in northern peatlands, relies on capillary rise to sustain metabolic activities. However, in restored peatlands, a capillary barrier resulting from distinctly different pore-size distributions in the degraded remnant cutover peat and regenerated Sphagnum moss limits capillary rise. Space-for-time analogues suggest it could take >40 years for decomposition and degradation of the moss profile to overcome this capillary barrier effect. This paper explores the feasibility of mechanical compression to ameliorate the capillary barrier effect and accelerate the return of ecohydrological function in restored Sphagnum moss. Seven reference cores (10 x 20 cm) and 29 samples (10 x 5 cm) representing various depths from surface (0-5 cm, n = 9; 5-10 cm, n = 9; 10-15 cm, n = 7; 15-20 cm, n = 4) were tested in a laboratory setting to analyse pre-compression and post-compression water retention-unsaturated hydraulic conductivity relationships, proportion of macropores, and other hydrophysical parameters. Post-compression, reference core moss height (originally 20 cm) decreased by 5.5 +/- 1.2 cm, and sample bulk density increased, while porosity decreased (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.01). Increased water retention and subsequent increase in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity post-compression was a result of a decrease in macropores (diameter > 75 mu m). Simulation results with Hydrus-1D indicate that the post-compression moss profile was better suited to maintain pressure heads above critical values for photosynthesis. These findings suggest that mechanical compression may be used to ameliorate the capillary barrier effect in restored cutover peatlands; however, field scale studies are required.

AB Saltwater intrusion and inundation can affect soil microbial activity, which regulates the carbon (C) balance in mangroves and helps to determine if these coastal forests can keep pace with sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity (+15 ppt), increased inundation (-8 cm), and their combination, on soil organic C loss from a mangrove peat soil (Everglades, Florida, USA) under simulated tides. Soil respiration (CO2 flux), methane (CH4) flux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and porewater nutrient concentrations were quantified. Soil respiration was the major pathway of soil organic C loss (94-98%) and was approximately 90% higher in the control water level than the inundated treatment under elevated salinity. Respiration rate increased with water temperature, but depended upon salinity and tidal range. CH4 flux was minimal, while porewater DOC increased with a concomitant, significant decline in soil bulk density under increased inundation. Porewater ammonium increased (73%) with inundation and soluble reactive phosphorus increased (32%) with salinity. Overall, the decline in soil organic C mineralization from combined saltwater intrusion and prolonged inundation was not significant, but results suggest SLR could increase this soil's susceptibility to peat collapse and accelerate nutrient and DOC export to adjacent Florida Bay.

AB Organic soils comprise a large yet fragile carbon (C) store in the global C cycle. Drainage, necessary for agriculture and forestry, triggers rapid decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), typically increasing in the order forest < grassland < cropland. However, there is also large variation in decomposition due to differences in hydrological conditions, climate and specific management. Here we studied the role of SOM composition on peat decomposability in a variety of differently managed drained organic soils. We collected a total of 560 samples from 21 organic cropland, grassland and forest soils in Switzerland, monitored their CO2 emission rates in lab incubation experiments over 6 months at two temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C) and related them to various soil characteristics, including bulk density, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and elemental ratios (C = N, H / C and O / C). CO2 release ranged from 6 to 195 mg CO(2-)Cg(-1) SOC at 10 degrees C and from 12 to 423 mg g(-1) at 20 degrees C. This variation occurring under controlled conditions suggests that besides soil water regime, weather and management, SOM composition may be an underestimated factor that determines CO2 fluxes measured in field experiments. However, correlations between the investigated chemical SOM characteristics and CO2 emissions were weak. The latter also did not show a dependence on land-use type, although peat under forest was decomposed the least. High CO2 emissions in some topsoils were probably related to the accrual of labile crop residues. A comparison with published CO2 rates from incubated mineral soils indicated no difference in SOM decomposability between these soil classes, suggesting that accumulation of recent, labile plant materials that presumably account for most of the evolved CO2 is not systematically different between mineral and organic soils. In our data set, temperature sensitivity of decomposition (Q(10) on average 2.57 +/- 0.05) was the same for all land uses but lowest below 60 cm in croplands and grasslands. This, in turn, indicates a relative accumulation of recalcitrant peat in topsoils.

ID SOIL STRENGTH; ROOT-GROWTH; CONE INDEX; ACID
AB The residual effect of various soil amendments on the reconsolidation of a strongly acidic Salisbury silt loam C horizon which contained 0.25% free aluminium was investigated in the laboratory.  Limestone (CaCO3), gypsum (CaSO4) and peat moss were added at 0.5, 0.08 and 2.0% (w/w), respectively.  In a fourth treatment, CaCO3 (0.5%, w/w) was added 24 months previously.  Results from these treatments were compared to those from an untreated control.  All soils were redisturbed to simulate tillage.  The soils were subjected to a standard Proctor test and a low-energy compaction test designed to simulate a 0.44 m soil overburden.  Penetrometer studies were performed to examine soil strength.
   The mineralogy of the Salisbury C-horizon was dominated by illite, with lesser amounts of chlorite occurring; kaolinite and vermiculite were present only in small amounts.  Application of peat lowered the maximum dry density of the Proctor test and increased the concomitant optimum moisture content.  Soil chemical amendments had no effect on compaction as measured by the Proctor test, but significantly increased the dry bulk density in the low-energy compaction test.  Hence volumetric moisture content, at a moisture tension of 101 kPa, was increased by the chemical amendments.  Soil strength, as measured by the cone index at a constant soil moisture tension, was decreased by the chemical amendments; however, after correction for volumetric moisture content, no treatment effect occurred.  The chemical amendments significantly decreased the concentrations of inorganic and organically bound Al and inorganically bound Fe.
   The results of the low-energy compaction test suggest that application of gypsum or limestone amendments to severely disturbed, highly acidic soils, which contain appreciable amounts of aluminium oxides and exchangeable aluminium, may increase the soil's propensity to reconsolidate.  This was not revealed by the standard Proctor test.

AB The age of vegetation restoration has significant influences on near-surface hydrological function and soil quality in mining areas. This study analyzed the effects of restoration age and tree species on water conservation function (reflected by the water-holding characteristics of litter and soil) and soil fertility quality [reflected by soil bulk density (BD), soil organic carbon (SOC), total N (TN), available N (AN), available P (AP), and available K (AK)] of restored woodlands in phosphate mined-out areas. A primary forest (the control) and six woodlands restored for 4-25 years were selected as test sites. The results showed that total litter storage capacity, litter water-holding capacity, soil effective water-holding capacity, SOC, TN, AN, AP, and the comprehensive soil fertility index (SFI) increased with the restoration age, while small changes were also observed in soil total water-holding capacity, BD, and AK with restoration age. Compared to the control, the litter-modified interception amount, soil total water-holding capacity, and SFI in woodlands restored for 25 years were restored on average by 78%, 77%, and 92%, respectively. Furthermore, the litter water-holding capacities, soil capillary water-holding capacity, and AN in the Eucalyptus robusta woodlands restored for 10 years were significantly lower than those in woodlands of Alnus nepalensis restored for < 10 years. Our findings highlight that the restoration age has positive impacts on improving the water conservation function and soil fertility quality of restored woodlands, and the influence of tree species on the water conservation function should be specifically considered while carrying out vegetation restoration in phosphate mined-out areas.

AB The prospect of harvesting forest-peatland systems in the coastal western hemlock forest region of British Columbia has created the need for an understanding of the interrelationship between topography, groundwater flow, and site productivity. Detailed topographic mapping including the use of ground-penetrating radar coupled with point measurements of specific yield, bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and groundwater level were used to determine the characteristics of groundwater flow along forest-peatland complexes. A topographic index was then used to characterize the spatial distribution of groundwater flow and site conditions (as represented by water table depth and organic horizon thickness) influencing forest community type. Forest community type mean index decreased from open peatland to upland forest. Areas with high slope indices had thicker organic horizons (0.7-1.8 m), water tables closer to the surface (0-0.2 m), and higher soil moisture contents (46-92%). These conditions affect successional dynamics and favour the invasion of hydrophytic species such as Sphagnum mosses. Areas with low slope index values were associated with shallower organic horizons (< 0.4 m), deeper water table (0.3 to > 1.6 m), and drier soil moisture (35-76%), favouring more prolific timber growth.

AB Peatlands in the Sanjiang Plain could be more vulnerable to global warming because they are located at the southernmost boundary of northern peatlands. Unlike bacteria, fungi are often overlooked, even though they play important roles in substance circulation in the peatland ecosystems. Accordingly, it is imperative that we deepen our understanding of fungal community structure and diversity in the peatlands. In this study, high-throughput Illumina sequencing was used to study the fungal communities in three fens in the Sanjiang Plain, located at the southern edge of northern peatlands. Peat soil was collected from the three fens which developed during different periods. A total of 463,198 fungal ITS sequences were obtained, and these sequences were classified into at least six phyla, 21 classes, more than 60 orders and over 200 genera. The fungal community structures were distinct in the three sites and were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. However, there were no significant differences between these three fens in any alpha-diversity index (p > 0.05). Soil age and the carbon (C) accumulation rate, as well as total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio, and bulk density were found to be closely related to the abundance of several dominant fungal taxa. We captured a rich fungal community and confirmed that the dominant taxa were those which were frequently detected in other northern peatlands. Soil age and the C accumulation rate were found to play important roles in shaping the fungal community structure.

AB Gasification and torrefaction have both gained significant interest as bioenergy techniques. During biomass gasification together with fuel gas, carbon-rich solid substances are produced, whereas torrefaction process is mainly used to prepare a final product with higher calorific value and carbon content than the feedstock, through a low temperature pyrolysis. Both materials (carbon wastes from gasification and torrefied product) could be classified as alternatives to biochar obtained from slow pyrolysis of biomass. The use of biochar, typically from the slow pyrolysis of biomass, as soil amendment and, more recently, as growing media components has been widely researched. However, to our knowledge, no studies have compared the use of biochar from gasification and torrefaction as growing media component for growing media formulation. The objective of this work was to study the effect of two biochars on peat-based growing media: a pinewood gasification biochar (BG) and a biochar (BT) obtained by torrefaction of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. Growing media mixing PT (peat) with 50%vol of BG or BT were prepared and characterized according to their chemical, thermal and hydrophysical properties. Phytotoxic experiments and growth of Lolium perenne were also performed. Results indicated that peat substitution in growing media by BG and BT at a 50%vol ratio improved their hydrophysical properties. Specifically, bulk density increased more than 50%, air space increased by 43%, the increment of the total porosity was 20%, and, finally, the water holding capacity increased by 18.3%. Significantly, a positive effect on plant biomass production (yield increment: 274%) was observed after addition of BT, whereas no significant differences were observed after addition of BG biochar. Therefore, it can be concluded that both BT and BG could be used as peat substitutes in growing media formulation.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, consumption, and quality displayed differences after long-term (similar to 55years) hydrological alterations in a poor fen peatland in northern Michigan. The construction of an earthen levee resulted in areas of a raised and lowered water table (WT) relative to an unaltered intermediate WT site. The lowered WT site had greater peat aeration and larger seasonal vertical WT fluctuations that likely elevated peat decomposition and subsidence with subsequent increases in bulk density, vertical hydraulic gradient, decreased hydraulic conductivity (K-sat), and a greater pore water residence time relative to the unaltered site. The raised WT site displayed a decreased K-sat combined with seasonal upwelling events that contributed to a longer residence time in comparison to the unaltered site. These differences are potentially contributing to elevated DOC concentrations at the lowered and raised WT site relative to the unaltered site. Additionally, spectrophotometric indices and chemical constituent assays indicated that the lowered site DOC was more aromatic and contained elevated concentrations of phenolics compared to the intermediate site. The raised site DOC was less aromatic, less humified, and also had a greater phenolic content than the intermediate site. Furthermore, an incubation experiment showed that DOC in the raised site contained the greatest labile carbon source. Based on our results, long-term WT alterations will likely impose significant effects on DOC dynamics in these peatlands; however, WT position alone was not a good predictor of DOC concentrations, though impoundment appears to produce a more labile DOC whereas drainage increases DOC aromaticity.

AB Casing soil is a crucial component in the production of mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) and in the United Kingdom and Ireland it is prepared by neutralising raw peat with time. The initial peat quality determines many of the physical and chemical properties of the subsequent casing product and this, in turn, significantly impacts on the yield and quality of mushrooms produced. Information on the physical and chemical properties of the casing supplied, in particular those associated with water retention and absorption, is critical to an optimal management strategy. The casing suppliers need a rapid method to evaluate key properties, but the available analytical techniques are slow and laborious, often taking 7-15 days to complete. Raw peat and casing samples were scanned for visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) spectra and the results assessed using principal component analysis. The samples (177) were also analysed for pH, etectricaL conductivity, moisture content, ash, water absorption, water retention and bulk density. Using partial least squares regression analysis of the spectra and the measured values of the target parameters, calibration equations were generated and cross-validated within the sample set. The equations were then validated using an independent sample set (441 colLected from casing suppliers and growers. Early indications show good potential for the prediction of commercially important properties, such as dry matter, ash content, water absorption, water retention and pH. With a turnaround time of minutes, from initial scanning to the presentation of results, vis-NIR spectroscopy affords both the casing suppliers and, ultimately, the growers the opportunity to progress and improve upon current industry standards.

ID PHYTOTOXICITY; TEMPERATURE
AB This work studies variables measured from the first phase of composting through the acquisition of the final product, with the goal of identifying those that are more strongly related to quality and are most useful for developing an index. The necessity to establish quality control procedures thus exists for the classification of raw materials in the same way as for the finished products. To accomplish this, three mixtures were prepared, with the goal of achieving a C/N ratio of 30 and a moisture content of 60%. The primary component of each mixture was: fruit processing waste (C1), sewage sludge from the food industry (C2), and the manufacturing waste of fried foods (C3). Temperatures were measured over 107 days, with the corresponding data fit to a logistical model where T degrees C similar to alpha / ((1 + exp (- (Time - beta) / - gamma))) + delta, with interaction compost * time being statistically significant (p < 0.001). This allowed for the temperatures, in keeping with health concerns, to be confirmed. Likewise, a linear regression analysis demonstrated the decomposition of organic matter at 0.82%/week. Statistically, the parameters, measured during the process, with the least variability were selected, which differed in the average contrasts: germination index (cucumber), electrical conductivity, and average moisture. A principal component analysis (PCA) and Spearman's correlation analysis revealed the best Germination Index (GI) values for C1, due to lower electrical conductivity (EC) and bulk density (Bd) along with higher organic matter content (TOM). For its part, C2 induced a higher Relative emergence (RE) of the cucumber thanks to its higher content of total nitrogen (TN) and lower contribution of Cu, Zn and K. C3 showed a higher presence of salts, less favorable physical characteristics (>Bd and <TPS, total pore space) and higher content of Zn and Cu. Composting carried out with appropriate mixtures can offer high-quality products for use as fertiliser, in soil restoration, and as an alternative substrate to peat and virgin mountain soil.

AB Vertical distributions of total N, P, K, Ca and Mg in a 0-60 cm surface peat layer were studied at 80 pine mire sites in southern Finland. The sites fell into two categories according to the soil nutrient regime: Meso-oligotrophic and oligo-ombrotrophic, and formed a chronosequence from undrained sites to sites drained 55 years ago. A statistically significant drainage age effect on the gravimetric (mg g(-1)) concentration profile forms was detected for all nutrients except K. In oligo-ombrotrophic sites the concentration of N increased following drainage in the topmost layer (0-10 cm) and that of P in all layers. In meso-oligotrophic sites the changes in N and P profiles were obscure. The concentration profiles of K remained clearly surface-enriched in both site type groups, but there was a general drop in the concentration values immediately after drainage. Ca and Mg decreased, especially in the 10-20 and 25-35 cm layers in both site type groups. The volumetric (kg m(-3)) nutrient concentrations clearly reflected the increase in the bulk density of the surface peat occurring after drainage. The compaction of peat had compensated for the effect of the processes removing nutrients from the soil (increased tree stand uptake, leaching); for Ca and Mg to a lesser degree than for the other nutrients. It was concluded that the N, P and K profiles did not show changes that would be likely to affect site productivity, whereas the net loss of Ca and Mg may cause problems in the longer term. As the total K capital of the sites was in general rather small, a disturbance in the biological cycle, such as cutting of the tree stand, may be critical.

AB In this study, fibrist and saprist sphagnum peat soils taken from a bog in Torbay, Newfoundland (Canada) were characterized. The saprist and fibrist peat soils had wet bulk densities of 0.65 and 0.60 g/cm(3), respectively, and cation-exchange capacities of 70 and 45 meq/100 g, respectively. The pH of both peat soils was 4.2 and the soils were amorphous for the most part; however, the fibrist peat was more porous than the saprist peat. Results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and (13)carbon nuclear magnetic resonance suggested the presence of carboxylic acid, alcoholic hydroxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, amine and amide functional groups in both peats. The less reported amine and amide groups may have been observed because non-destructive characterization techniques were employed. The saprist peat was studied as an Ni2+ and Co2+ adsorbent in a vertical downflow fixed-bed column and at the end of each column experiment, metal ions in the upper layer of the peat were desorbed with HCl. The metal sorption capacity of the saprist peat increased with decreasing flow rate and overall the sorption capacity of Ni2+ was two times greater than the sorption capacity of Co2+, Ni2+ may have been retained by a combination of ion exchange and complexation, while Co2+ may have been retained only by complexation.

AB The potential of using X-ray computed tomography (CT) to (i) analyse individual biogenic gas bubbles entrapped within peats and (ii) produce reliable descriptors of petit Structure is examined. Existing approaches used to study biogenic gas bubbles measure the gas content of volumes of: peat many orders Of magnitude larger than most bubbles, and are, therefore, Of little use in helping to understand bubble dynamics. In many peatland Studies, the description of peat structures is derived front only a few relatively basic metrics; principally the porosity, the bulk density, and the von Post humification scale. CT is applied to identify and quantitatively analyse the size, location and shape of individual gas bubbles entrapped during the saturation of a 200 cm(3) sample of S. fuscum. 3421 gas bubbles were identified, ranging in size from 0.1 mm(3) to 99.9 mm(3). These gas bubbles were non-randomly distributed, clustered Predominantly in the vertical plane. When analysing the peat Structure, Sphagnum peal in water are shown to be indistinguishable within CT scans. Peat samples were therefore prepared prior to scanning by flushing the peat with lead (II) nitrate solution to increase the linear attenuation of the Sphagnum. Sphagnum stems and branches were analysed, producing metrics of the peat structure including stern and branch lengths, radii and orientation. In a 100 cm(3) sample of S. magellanicum, the length of all Sphagnum sterns totalled 1.82 m, with an average radius of 0.65 mm. The Sphagnum sterns and branches were both preferentially orientated in file horizontal direction. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Purpose Peat-based substrates constitute the preferred media in conventional and organic nursery production. Nevertheless, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in environmental impacts associated with peat extraction that has increased with the demand of these non-renewable substrates. The re-use of organic wastes as substrate seems to be good solution to substitute commercial peat. This study evaluates date-palm peat (wastes of date-palm branches base locally known as "Kornef') as an alternative nursery substrate.
   Methods The research was conducted in a completely block randomized design with a linear substitution (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%) of peat with date-palm waste peat for transplant production of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Different physicochemical parameters (porosity, bulk density, pH, and CEC) of cultivation substrates were measured. The growth parameters (leaves number, leaves area, length, chlorophyll values, fresh and dry weight of seedlings) were evaluated at the end of growth period (when the seedling reached the commercial transplanting size).
   Results The results showed that date-palm waste peat is an appropriate media for nursery production, showing similar properties with commercial peat and best plant response with 25 and 50% substitution.
   Conclusions In view of low cost, availability and large area of date-palm cultivation in Tunisia and over the world, it seems that peat can be replaced with substrate of date-palm wastes in the horticulture sector.

AB The ability of the following four organic amendments to ameliorate saline soil in coastal northern China was investigated from April 2010 to October 2012 in a field experiment: green waste compost (GWC), sedge peat (SP), furfural residue (FR), and a mixture of GWC, SP and FR (1: 1: 1 by volume) (GSF). Compared to a non-amended control (CK), the amendments, which were applied at 4.5 kg organic matter m(-3), dramatically promoted plant growth; improved soil structure; increased the cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon, and available nutrients; and reduced the salt content, electrical conductivity (EC), and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). At the end of the experiment in soil amended with GSF, bulk density, EC, and ESP had decreased by 11, 87, and 71%, respectively, and total porosity and organic carbon had increased by 25 and 96% respectively, relative to the CK. The GSF treatment resulted in a significantly lower Na++K+ content than the other treatments. CEC and the contents of available N, P, and K were significantly higher in the GSF-treated soil than in the CK and were the highest in all treatments. The FR treatment resulted in the lowest pH value and Ca2+ concentration, which decreased by 8% and 39%, respectively, relative to the CK. Overall, the results indicate that a combination of green waste compost, sedge peat and furfural residue (GSF treatment) has substantial potential for ameliorating saline soils in the coastal areas of northern China, and it works better than each amendment alone. Utilization of GWC and FR can be an alternative organic amendment to substitute the nonrenewable SP in saline soil amelioration.

TI Methane fluxes on boreal peatlands of different fertility and the effect

AB Methane (CH4) fluxes were measured at 17 peatland sites with different nutritional and hydrological characteristics in the southern and middle boreal zones in Finland by a static chamber technique. Many of the natural peatlands also had counterparts drained for forestry 30-50 years ago. The mean emissions from May to September were 8.0 g CH4 m(-2) for natural ombrogenous bogs and 19.0 g CH4 m(-2) for natural minerogenous fens thus being higher than the 2 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1) estimated for the Canadian peatlands. Change in the mean water table level had greater effect on CH4 fluxes on natural fens than on natural bogs. The mean CH4 emissions on drained bogs and fens were 3.9 g CH4 m(-2) and 0.3 g CH4 m(-2), respectively. Some drained fens even had CH4 uptake from the atmosphere. The change in the mean water table had the lowest effect on CH4 fluxes on drained peatlands. The CH4 fluxes on peatlands (natural fens and bogs and drained peatlands) are associated with peat aeration, nutrient level, vegetation cover, peat compaction, peat temperature, and finally with microbial processes responsible for the net release of CH4. We could explain 67% of the variation in mean CH4 fluxes on Finnish peatlands by measuring the mean water table, peat bulk density, and peat pH. The present results can be used to predict the possible changes in CH4 emissions on peatlands if the climate is drying in north. For example, lowering of the present water table by 10 cm would induce a 70% reduction in the CH4 emissions from fens and a 45% reduction from bogs.

TI Short- and long-term hydrologic controls on smouldering fire in wetland

ID PEAT
AB Smouldering fire vulnerability in organic-rich, wetland soils is regulated by hydrologic regimes over short (by antecedent wetness) and long (through influences on soil properties) timescales. An integrative understanding of these controls is needed to inform fire predictions and hydrologic management to reduce fire vulnerability. The Great Dismal Swamp, a drained peatland (Virginia and North Carolina, USA), recently experienced large wildfires, motivating hydrologic restoration efforts. To inform those efforts, we combined continuous water levels, soil properties, moisture holding capacity and smouldering probability at four sites along a hydrologic gradient. For each site, we estimated gravimetric soil moisture content associated with a 50% smouldering probability (soil moisture smoulder threshold) and the water tension required to create this moisture threshold (tension smoulder threshold). Soil properties influenced both thresholds. Soils with lower bulk density smouldered at higher moisture content but also had higher moisture holding capacity, indicating that higher tensions (e.g. deeper water tables) are required to reach smouldering thresholds. By combining thresholds with water level data, we assessed smouldering vulnerability over time, providing a framework to guide fire prediction and hydrologic restoration. This work is among the first to integrate soil moisture thresholds, moisture holding capacities and water level dynamics to explore spatiotemporal variation in smouldering fire vulnerability.

AB A method to estimate peat depth and extent is vital for accurate estimation of carbon stocks and to facilitate appropriate peatland management. Current methods for direct measurement (e.g. ground penetrating radar, probing) are labour intensive making them unfeasible for capturing spatial information at landscape extents. Attempts to model peat depths using remotely sensed data such as elevation and slope have shown promise but assume a functional relationship between current conditions and gradually accrued peat depth. Herein we combine LiDAR-derived metrics known to influence peat accumulation (elevation, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI)) with passive gamma-ray spectrometric survey data, shown to correlate with peat occurrence, to develop a novel peat depth model for Dartmoor.
   Total air absorbed dose rates of Thorium, Uranium and Potassium were calculated, referred to as radiometric dose. Relationships between peat depth, radiometric dose, elevation, slope and TWI were trained using 1334 peat depth measurements, a further 445 measurements were used for testing. All variables showed significant relationships with peat depth. Linear stepwise regression of natural log-transformed variables indicated that a radiometric dose and slope model had an r(2) = 0.72/0.73 and RMSE 0.31/0.31 m for training/testing respectively. This model estimated an area of 158 +/- 101 km(2) of peaty soil > 0.4 m deep across the study area. Much of this area (60 km(2)) is overlain by grassland and therefore may have been missed if vegetation cover was used to map peat extent. Using published bulk density and carbon content values we estimated 13.1 Mt. C (8.1-21.9 Mt. C) are stored in the peaty soils within the study area. This is an increase on previous estimates due to greater modelled peat depth. The combined use of airborne gamma-ray spectrometric survey and LiDAR data provide a novel, practical and repeatable means to estimate peat depth with no a priori knowledge, at an appropriate resolution (10 m) and extent (406 km(2)) to facilitate management of entire peatland complexes.

AB Among forest fires, underground (peat) fires lead in terms of the amount of material burned per unit area and, consequently, the impact on climate change, but they differ in the complexity of assessing the loss of soil carbon and its emissions to the atmosphere. Using the example of the 2010 forest and peat fire in Moscow oblast (an area of 9 ha with a variable original tree-stand composition), the depth of burnout and loss of soil carbon were determined by reconstructing the prefire soil surface along the root collar of stumps, as well as comparing the characteristics of peat on the burned and adjacent areas. The average (median) burnout depth was 15 +/- 8 (14) cm, varying in different areas from 13 +/- 5 (11) to 20 +/- 9 (19) cm. The burnout depth increased with the relative surface height and was maximum in areas with a predominance of aspen. Based on the data of the layer-by-layer determination of the bulk density, ash content, and carbon content in peat, the dependences of the carbon stock on the peat thickness are obtained. Based on them, and according the depth of burning, the carbon losses are estimated, which amount to an average (median) of 9.8 +/- 5.57 (9.22) kg m(-2) for the burned-out areas, varying in different areas from 8.61 +/- 3.75 (7.39) to 12.9 +/- 6.18 (12.3) kg m(-2), which is equivalent to a one-time emission of almost 400 t CO2 ha(-1) and at least 1.5 times higher than the possible release of CO2 into the atmosphere from the loss of carbon biomass of a growing stand with a stem wood stock of more than 280 m(3) ha(-1). The results correspond to the upper limit of estimates of soil carbon losses obtained by foreign authors and confirm the underestimation of the factor of underground (peat) fires in the boreal zone in comparison with the tropics and in general when considering the influence of forest and peatland ecosystems on the gas composition of the atmosphere and climate.

   vegetation in rewetted bog remnants
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE bog restoration; carbon dioxide; light attenuation; methane; peat
   buoyancy; pH; Sphagnum
AB Restoration of peat bog vegetation in highly degraded peatlands is generally attempted by improving the hydrology of these areas. The present paper discusses and explains various restoration strategies relating to peat quality, water chemistry and hydrology. In some cases, (shallow) inundation of bog remnants leads to a rapid redevelopment of (floating) Sphagnum vegetation, usually when poorly humified Sphagnum peat is still present. After inundation, the peat either swells up to the newly created water table or becomes buoyant, in both cases creating a favorable substrate for Sphagnum mosses. Bulk density and methane production rate play an important role in the buoyancy of floating peat, methane providing buoyancy to the substrates. The presence of (slightly) calcareous groundwater in the peat base may enhance the development of floating rafts by stimulating decomposition processes. Alternatively, the growth of submerged Sphagnum species can also lead to the development of floating rafts. This depends on the penetration of light into the water layer and the availability of carbon dioxide in the water layer.
   Many bog remnants, however, only have strongly humified peat, which does not favor the redevelopment of Sphagnum carpets after deep inundation. On the other hand, most peat moss species appear to do very well on surface soaked black peat, which is why shallow inundation (< 0.3 m) is to be preferred in such cases. Compartmentalization of the terrain will probably be necessary to ensure a more or less constant water table.
   An important prerequisite for the successful restoration of bog remnants is the development of a hydrologically self-regulating acrotelm. Key species involved in this development are Sphagnum magellanicum, Sphagnum papillosum and Sphagnum rubellum. These typical hummock and lawn species are usually very slow colonizers compared to hollow species such as Sphagnum cuspidatum and Sphagnum fallax. Introduction of key species in carpets dominated by hollow species or on bare substrates appears to be very successful, indicating that the main constraint is colonization.

AB Accurate predictions of the soil-gas diffusivity (D-p/D-o' where D-p is the soil-gas diffusion coefficient and D-o is the diffusion coefficient in free air) from easily measureable parameters like air-filled porosity (epsilon) and soil total porosity (phi) are valuable when predicting soil aeration and the emission of greenhouse gases and gaseous-phase contaminants from soils. Soil type (texture) and soil density (compaction) are two key factors controlling gas diffusivity in soils. We extended a recently presented density-corrected D-p(epsilon)/D-o model by letting both model parameters (alpha and beta) be interdependent and also functions of phi. The extension was based on literature measurements on Dutch and Danish soils ranging from sand to peat. The parameter alpha showed a promising linear relation to total porosity, while beta also varied with alpha following a weak linear relation. The thus generalized density-corrected (GDC) model gave improved predictions of diffusivity across a wide range of soil types and density levels when tested against two independent data sets (total of 280 undisturbed soils or soil layers) representing Danish soil profile data (0-8 m below the ground surface) and performed better than existing models. The GDC model was further extended to describe two-region (bimodal) soils and could describe and predict D-p/D-o well for both different soil aggregate size fractions and variably compacted volcanic ash soils. A possible use of the new GDC model is engineering applications such as the design of highly compacted landfill site caps.

AB A sensor comprised of an electronic circuit and a hybrid single and dual heat pulse probe was constructed and tested along with a novel signal processing procedure to determine changes in the effective dual-probe spacing radius over the time of measurement. The circuit utilized a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to control heat inputs into the soil medium in lieu of a variable resistor. The system was designed for onboard signal processing and implemented USB, RS-232, and SDI-12 interfaces for machine-to-machine (M2M) exchange of data, thereby enabling heat inputs to be adjusted to soil conditions and data availability shortly after the time of experiment. Signal processing was introduced to provide a simplified single-probe model to determine thermal conductivity instead of reliance on late-time logarithmic curve fitting. Homomorphic and derivative filters were used with a dual-probe model to detect changes in the effective probe spacing radius over the time of experiment to compensate for physical changes in radius as well as model and experimental error. Theoretical constraints were developed for an efficient inverse of the exponential integral on an embedded system. Application of the signal processing to experiments on sand and peat improved the estimates of soil water content and bulk density compared to methods of curve fitting nominally used for heat pulse probe experiments. Applications of the technology may be especially useful for soil and environmental conditions under which effective changes in probe spacing radius need to be detected and compensated for over the time of experiment.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) in high latitude ecosystems is potentially vulnerable to global climate change. However, the distribution of SOC and total nitrogen (N) is still unknown for the boreal wetlands. In this study, we collected soil samples from different wetlands in the discontinuous permafrost zone of the Xiao Xing'an Mountains, northeastern China. Permafrost was only present in the bogs and fens in this zone. Soil C concentrations were significantly correlated with total N concentrations and bulk density (P < 0.001). Wetland type, soil depth, and incidence of fire affected soil C and total N concentrations, suggesting that vegetation changes in wetlands could alter the soil C and nutrient sequestration processes under future global warming scenarios. However, soil C and total N storage in the 40 cm depth was not significantly different between wetland types (P > 0.05), suggesting that future global warming and vegetation change would not significantly affect soil C and total N storage in upper soil layers in wetlands. However, vegetation changes are likely to increase the depth of the permafrost active layer under permafrost degradation, release deep soil C, and add C to the atmosphere over the coming decades.

AB Research was carried out to evaluate composted olive-m ill waste as a peat substitute in foliage potted plant production. Rooted cuttings of Codiaeum variegatum (L.) A. Juss and Syngonium podophyllum Schott were grown for 5 months and Ficus benjamina L. for 10 months in media containing olive-mill waste compost (OWC), sphagnum peat and perlite in 1:3:4, 1:1:2, and 3:1:4 ratio (by volume), respectively, and their foliage and root growth was determined and compared to a control medium of I peat: I perlite (by volume). When up to 75% of peat in the control medium was replaced by OWC, C. variegatum foliage and root growth were similar compared with the control, while a 50% peat replacement gave the best growth. Syngonium podophyllum was more sensitive to peat replacement compared to C. variegatum, as only 25% of peat could be replaced by OWC without any reduction in foliage growth. The dry weight of the roots was not affected in all media tested. In E benjamina, peat could be replaced up to 75% without effects on plant height and lateral shoot number, while the length of the laterals was progressively reduced with increasing OWC level. However, only at the highest OWC level (75% peat replacement) the laterals were shorter compared with the control. There was also a progressive reduction of main stem diameter, foliage fresh weight, and root dry weight with increasing OWC level in the medium. Even the lowest OWC level (25% peat replacement) caused a decrease of foliage and root weight compared with the control, with no effect though on plant visual quality. Even a 25% peat replacement by OWC caused an increase in bulk density. A considerable decrease of total porosity and readily available water were measured in media where 50% or 75% of peat was replaced by OWC. The pH of the medium with the highest OWC level was high during the first 4 months of culture compared to the other media. The electrical conductivity initially related to OWC level, but it decreased to values similar to that in the control medium during the first month of culture.

AB The effect of preferential flow in soil pipes on nitrate retention in riparian zones is poorly understood. The characteristics of soil pipes and their influence on patterns of groundwater transport and nitrate dynamics were studied along four transects in a 1- to >3-m deep layer of peat and marl overlying an oxic sand aquifer in a riparian zone in southern Ontario, Canada. The peat-marl deposit, which consisted of several horizontal layers with large differences in bulk density, contained soil pipes that were generally 0.1 to 0.2?m in diameter and often extended vertically for 1 to >2?m. Springs that produced overland flow across the riparian area occurred at some sites where pipes extended to the peat surface. Concentrations of NO3-N (2030?mg?L-1) and dissolved oxygen (DO) (46?mg?L-1) observed in peat pipe systems and surface springs were similar to values in the underlying sand aquifer, indicating that preferential flow transported groundwater with limited nitrate depletion. Low NO3-N concentrations of <5?mg?L-1 and enriched d15N values indicated that denitrification was restricted to small areas of the peat where pipes were absent. Groundwater DO concentrations declined rapidly to <2?mg?L-1 in the peat matrix adjacent to pipes, whereas high NO3-N concentrations of >15?mg?L-1 extended over a larger zone. Low dissolved organic carbon values at these locations suggest that supplies of organic carbon were not sufficient to support high rates of denitrification, despite low DO conditions. These data indicate that it is important to develop a greater understanding of pipes in peat deposits, which function as sites where the transport of large fluxes of water with low biogeochemical reaction rates can limit the nitrate removal capacity of riparian zones.

AB The presence of forest vegetation can aid in preserving the permafrost layer by maintaining lower soil temperatures via the accretion of an organic layer at the surface. This layer has a low bulk density and low thermal conductivity (due also to high evapotranspiration rates by forest vegetation), which insulates ice-rich permafrost. Forest removal can lead to significant increases in the summer soil temperature, which increases the thickness of the active layer (i.e., the surficial layer above permafrost which thaws during summer and freezes again in winter) and causes a rise in the active layer towards the surface. When vegetation is sensitive to saturated soil conditions, a rise in the active layer can lead to the conversion of forested areas to wetlands. In this manuscript, we develop a modeling framework to relate vegetation permafrost feedbacks to the emergence of multiple stable ecosystem states. Factors related to soil temperature and hydrologic characteristics of the system were examined to see how they affect the location of the stable and unstable states. This model was also used to examine how an increase in precipitation would affect the temporal dynamics of the active layer and vegetation. Results show that the presence of forest vegetation can enhance the resilience of the system in that it is less prone to state shifts following a disturbance. Understanding these dynamics is important given, (i) the rapid rate at which these systems can shift between states, (ii) the projected climatic changes for forested areas underlain by permafrost and (iii) the high rates of forest loss in these areas.

AB Surface topography of boreal peatlands is frequently hummocky. The hummocks and hollows develop from the peat and remain stable over long periods of time, even while climate and other environmental conditions change. Processes leading to these stable surface forms have not been clearly understood. The HOllow-HUMmock (HOHUM) model provides an explanation of bog microtopography, resilience, and stability. It suggests that bog microtopography results from moss species properties interacting with the physical environment.
   HOHUM is a dynamic, process-based simulation model simulating biological and physical processes leading to hummocks, hollows, and pools in boreal peatlands. It consists of several interacting submodels that grow hummocks and hollows at a monthly time step. Climate is represented by long-term monthly means for a specific location. The hydrology submodel. calculates seasonal water table fluctuations relative to the peat surface. The vegetation submodel grows-Sphagnum mosses using climate and moisture information and generates litter input; and the peat submodel simulates species- and layer-specific peat decay and accumulation. The model tracks the total depth of the top peat layer (acrotelm) of bogs produced by three common species of Sphagnum mosses, one of which forms high hummocks, another forms lower or middle hummock layers, and the third produces hollows.
   Model results indicate that hummocks and hollows arise primarily from species differences expressed through different peat accumulation rates. Interactions among moisture, unique Sphagnum species characteristics, and decomposition rates ate responsible for maintenance and resilience of hummocks and hollows. Feedbacks between Sphagnum growth, decay, and moisture restrict peat accumulation over time, creating a stable equilibrium with local climate Within decades. These feedbacks appear responsible for the long-term maintenance of bog hummocks-and hollows and their adaptation to changing environmental conditions
   Model validation showed excellent agreement (within 2 cm) between predicted and measured heights of hummocks, hollows, and water table depths for North American and European sites, and successfully reproduced conditions not anticipated during model development. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the model is most sensitive to decomposition rates, Sphagnum production rates, peat bulk densities, and the effects of hummock ice retention into the spring. Simulations for 35 northern US and Canadian sites predict distinct bog surface microtopography: hummocks and hollows are well developed in the eastern and northeastern regions of North America-With-the highest hummocks in far northeastern Canada, north of which hummocks grade into low surface relief. In the high-latitude Canadian interior extreme arctic conditions (cold and dry) prevent bog formation. South of the Great Lakes, wet hollow species are replaced by more drought-resistant species to form relatively flat lawns. These simulated geographic patterns agree with those reported for North American peatlands. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A composted material derived from biogas production residues, spent mushroom substrate (SMS) and pig manure was evaluated as a partial or total replacement for peat in growth medium for tomato and pepper seedlings. Five different substrates were tested: T1, compost + perlite (5:1, v:v); T2, compost + peat + perlite (4:1:1, v:v:v); T3, compost + peat + perlite (2.5:2.5:1, v:v:v); T4, compost + peat + perlite (1:4:1, v:v:v); and CK, a commercial peat + perlite (5:1, v:v). The physical-chemical characteristics of the various media were analyzed, and the germination rate and morphological growth were also measured. Real-time Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify Fusarium concentrations. The addition of compost to peat-based growth medium increased the pH, electrical conductivity, air porosity, bulk density, and nutrition (NPK), and decreased the water holding capacity and total porosity. The use of compost did not affect the percent germination at day 15 of the tomato and pepper seedlings. The addition of compost resulted in better or comparable seedling quality compared with CK and fertilized CK. The best growth parameters were seen in tomato and pepper seedlings grown in Tl and T2, with higher morphological growth in comparison with CK and fertilized CK. However, T2 showed the highest Fusarium concentration compared to compost and all growth media. Fusarium concentrations in T1, T3, and T4 did not differ significantly from those in CK for tomato seedlings, and those in T1 and T4 were also similar to those in CK for pepper seedlings. The results suggest that biogas residues and SMS compost is a good alternative to peat, allowing 100% replacement, and that 20-50% replacement produces tomato and pepper seedlings with higher morphological growth and lower Fusarium concentrations.

AB An increasing number of people lives in coastal zones with a subsurface consisting of heterogenic soft-soil sequences. Many of these sequences contain substantial amounts of peat. While population growth and urbanization continues in coastal zones, they are threatened by global sea-level rise and land subsidence. Peat compaction and oxidation, caused by loading and drainage, are important contributors to land subsidence, and hence relative sea-level rise, in peat-rich coastal zones. Especially built-up areas, having densely-spaced urban assets, are heavily impacted by land subsidence, in terms of livelihoods and damage-related costs. Yet, built-up areas have been largely avoided in peat compaction and oxidation field studies. Consequently, essential information on the relative contributions of both processes to total subsidence and underlying mechanisms, which is required for developing effective land use planning strategies, is lacking. Therefore, we quantified subsidence due to peat compaction and oxidation in built-up areas in the Rhine-Meuse delta, The Netherlands, using lithological borehole data and measurements of dry bulk density, organic matter, and CO2 respiration. We reconstructed subsidence over the last 1000 years of up to similar to 4 m, and recent subsidence rates of up to similar to 140 mm.yr(-1) averaged over an 11-year time span. The amount and rate of subsidence due to peat compaction and oxidation is variable in time and space, depending on the Holocene sequence composition, overburden thickness, loading time, organic-matter content, and groundwater-table depth. In our study area, the potential for future subsidence due to peat compaction and oxidation is substantial, especially where the peat layer occurs at shallow depthand is relatively uncompacted. We expect this is the case for many peat-rich coastal zones worldwide. We propose to use subsurface-based spatial planning, using specific subsurface information mentioned above, to inform land use planners about the most optimal building sites in organo-clastic coastal zones.

AB A novel approach to using peatlands for assessment of cumulative contributions from long-range transport of pollutants (LRTP) - airborne trace elements - to spatial pollution was exemplified in evaluating retrospective atmospheric deposition of priority pollutants (Pb, Cd, Hg) in peat bogs in Norway in areas minor affected by local sources of pollution and in NW Poland located on the way of possible LRTP from Poland to Norway. Peat from the corresponding C-14-dated layers of five ombrotrophic bogs in each country, was analysed for trace element contents. Pollutant concentrations/load distribution along the peat profiles related to bulk density has given a clear evidence of uneven density-dependent temporal vertical migration of all studied elements that distorts the chronology of their deposition. Much higher loads of Pb, Cd and Hg in southern Norwegian bogs than in bogs located in NW Poland proved transboundary transport from neighbouring highly industrialized European countries to be much more significant contributor to high deposition of the priority pollutants in this area and rather excludes LRTP from Poland as a major source of total land pollution in southernmost Norway. The study showed excellent applicability of peat bogs for the exact assessment of retrospective cumulative pollutant loads from LRTP, but not for the identification of deposition chronology. Combining the use of ombrotrophic peat bogs as tools for retrospective monitoring of cumulative land pollution with airborne elements with current LRTP data within the Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-Range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP) may provide a complete reliable picture of the effect of anthropogenic emissions on soil quality and create a foundation of optimum environmental policy and activities in this field.

AB Biochar (BC) has the potential to be used as alternative container substrate, which adds value to the bioenergy process. But high percentage of BC may suppress plant growth and there is limited research on BC and compost in container. High percentages of mixed hardwood BC (60%, 70%, 80% or 90%, by vol.) mixed with either 5% (by vol.) vermicompost (VC) or chicken manure compost (CM) were evaluated to substitute a peat-based commercial container substrate (Berger BM7), using basil (Ociinzun basilicum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) as test crops. Total porosity, container capacity, air space and bulk density of BC-compost mixes were all in or close to the recommended ranges for container substrates. High percentage of BC incorporation reduced the SPAD readings caused by BC's N-binding effect. BC-compost mixes had no effect on the plants' photosynthetic rates at 5 weeks after transplanting (WAT). At 8 WAT, the growth index (GI), shoot dry weight (DW) and fresh weight (FW), and root and total DW of basil plants in 80BC:5CM, 90BC:5VC and 90BC:5CM were reduced due to high salt and pH while those in other BC-compost mixes were similar to the control. The BC-compost mixes (except 90BC:5CM) did not negatively affect the GI, stem, root and total DW, and red and total fruit FW and DW of tomato plants. Therefore, 5% (by vol.) CM and VC was a good potential amendment candidate for replacing peat-based substrate with 60% and 70% BC to grow container plants. Mixture of 5% CM with 70% BC with the rest the Berger BM7 peat-based substrate is recommended since its wholesale price is estimated at 54% of that of 100% Berger BM7 substrate. These results benefit bioenergy companies by adding value to the byproduct BC and provide economical and sustainable container substrate alternatives for horticultural producers.

AB Long-term impacts of drier conditions on the hydrology of northern peatlands are poorly understood. We used long-term drainage near a historic drainage ditch, separating an area from the main peatland, as an analogue for long-term drying in a northern temperate bog. The objective was to identify the impact of drier conditions on ecohydrological processes and groundwater flow patterns in an area now forested and an area that maintained a bog-like character. Groundwater flow patterns alternated between mostly downward flow and occasionally upward flow in the bog area and were mostly upward-orientated in the forested area, which suggested that there the flow pattern had shifted from bog-to fen-like conditions. Flow patterns were in agreement with changes in post-drainage hydraulic conductivities, storage capacity of the peat and water table levels. Compared to the bog, hydraulic conductivities in the forested area were one to three orders of magnitude lower in the uppermost 0.75m of peat (paired t test, p < 0.05). Bulk density had increased and the water table level was lower and more strongly fluctuating in the forested area. Our findings suggest hydraulic gradients and flow patterns have changed due to increased evapotranspiration and interception with the emergence of a tree cover. The smaller size of the now-forested area relative to the remaining bog area appeared to be important for the hydrological change. With the main Mer Bleue bog as hinterland, enhanced runoff to the drainage channel had little effect on hydrologic and vegetation patterns. In the cut-off, smaller, now forested area pervasive changes in vegetation and hydrologic processes occurred. The difference in response to local drainage raises questions about tipping points with respect to the impact of drying on peatland ecosystems that need to be addressed in future research.

AB To understand, model, and predict landscape evolution, ecosystem services, and hydrological processes, the availability of detailed observation-based soil data is extremely valuable. For the EstSoil-EH dataset, we synthesized more than 20 eco-hydrological variables on soil, topography, and land use for Estonia (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3473289, Kmoch et al., 2019a) as numerical and categorical values from the original Soil Map of Estonia, the Estonian 5m lidar DEM, Estonian Topographic Database, and EUSoilHydroGrids layers.
   The Soil Map of Estonia maps more than 750 000 soil units throughout Estonia at a scale of 1 : 10 000 and forms the basis for EstSoil-EH. It is the most detailed and information-rich dataset for soils in Estonia, with 75 % of mapped units smaller than 4.0 ha, based on Soviet-era field mapping. For each soil unit, it describes the soil type (i.e. soil reference group), soil texture, and layer information with a composite text code, which comprises not only the actual texture class, but also classifiers for rock content, peat soils, distinct compositional layers, and their depths. To use these as eco-hydrological process properties in modelling applications we translated the text codes into numbers. The derived parameters include soil layering, soil texture (clay, silt, and sand contents), coarse fragments, and rock content of the soil layers within the soil profiles. In addition, we aggregated and predicted physical variables related to water and carbon cycles (bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, organic carbon content, available water capacity).
   The methodology and dataset developed will be an important resource for the Baltic region, but possibly also for all other regions where detailed field-based soil mapping data are available. Countries like Lithuania and Latvia have similar historical soil records from the Soviet era that could be turned into value-added datasets such as the one we developed for Estonia.

AB 1. Effects of climate change may affect the Sphagnum species composition in bogs, and ultimately the functioning of the whole ecosystem. We investigated the effect of different water tables on the competition between six Sphagnum species in the glasshouse. The amount of precipitation (234 mm year(-1)) and precipitation frequency (every 2 weeks) were kept low to encourage water-table effects. Relevant species combinations and monocultures were grown at different water tables for a 16-month period. We studied changes in cover, height increment and capitulum water content (WCcap) in order to understand competitive responses.
   2. Species naturally occurring further above the water table generally showed higher competitive strength than species naturally occurring closer to the water table. Surprisingly, this effect was irrespective of the water table, indicating a minor role for capillary water transport. Cover change seemed to be related to differences in length growth, but not to water table or WCcap.
   3. The WCcap of species within a mixture did not differ, but was lower than the WCcap of the individual species growing in monoculture, indicating differences in ability to supply water to the capitula between mono- and mixed cultures. Subcapitulum bulk densities between mono- and mixed cultures did not differ, or were even lower in monocultures, but did differ between species within mixed cultures.
   4. Our results indicate that structural heterogeneity of the peat in mixed cultures has a negative effect on WCcap of both species. Furthermore, we show that sustained periods of drought cause species that naturally occur further above the water table to oust species that naturally occur closer to the water table, even if the water table remains high. Ultimately, the Sphagnum vegetation in raised bogs may shift from hollow to hummock species, evening out the natural microtopography of raised bogs.

AB Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), the most common fuel additive used to oxygenate gasoline, is being detected more frequently in drinking water supplies. This research investigates the capacities of 10 different types of highly characterized peats to extract MTBE from contaminated water. Peat samples were slurried for 24 hours under controlled conditions in aqueous solutions of MTBE. Liquid portions of the samples were analyzed for MTBE concentrations using a Solid-phase Microextraction GC/MS (SPME-GC/MS) method and were compared to samples of the MTBE solution (without peat addition) to determine the peats' MTBE sorption capacities. The SPME-GC/MS results indicate that all peats tested worked well at extracting MTBE from an aqueous solution. Although this was so, some peats tended to work better than others. The Loxahatchee Nymphaea and the Maine Sphagnum peats worked best, producing 92 and 88% MTBE reductions, respectively, while the Okefenokee Taxodium and the New York peats achieved the poorest results, producing only 50 and 47% MTBE reductions, respectively. In addition, the peats derived from herbaceous vegetation worked better than those derived from woody plants (except for the woody North Carolina peat). Overall, the peats that were the most effective at extracting MTBE from water tended to have higher hydraulic conductivities, microporosities, macroporosities, total porosities, and water holding capacities, but lower bulk densities, total ash contents, Ti contents, P contents, Si contents, K contents, Al contents, fulvic acid contents, total guaiacyl lignin contents, and total other ketones contents. Peats with higher MTBE extraction capacities also had humic acids contents that ranged between 4.6-7.1%. These results suggest that peats could be used as filtration, or sorption, media to remediate surface water or groundwater that is contaminated with MTBE. SPME-GC/MS analysis was found to be a reasonably inexpensive and efficient way to evaluate MTBE sorption capacities of peat samples.

AB The magnitude and acceleration of carbon dioxide emissions from warming Arctic tundra soil is an important part of the Region's influence on the Earth's climate system. We investigated the links between soil carbon stocks, soil organic matter decomposition, vegetation heterogeneity, temperature, and environmental sensitivities in dwarf shrub tundra near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. We quantified carbon stocks of forty-two soil profiles using bulk density estimates based on previous studies in the region. The soil profiles were located within six vegetation types at nine study sites, distributed across an environmental gradient. We also monitored air and soil temperature and measured in situ soil respiration to quantify variation in carbon flux between vegetation types. For spatial extrapolation, we created a high-resolution land cover classification map of the study area. Aside from a single soil profile taken from a fen soil (54.55 kg C m(-2); 2.13 kg N m(-2)), the highest carbon stocks were found in wet grassland soils (mean, 95% CI: 34.87 kg C m(-2), [27.30, 44.55]). These same grassland soils also had the highest mid-growing-season soil respiration rates. Our estimation of soil carbon stocks and mid-growing-season soil respiration measurements indicate that grassland soils are a "hot spot" for soil carbon storage and soil carbon dioxide efflux. Even though shrub, steppe, and mixed vegetation had lower average soil carbon stocks (14.66 - 20.17 kg C m(-2)), these vegetation types played an important role in carbon cycling at the landscape scale because they cover approximately 50 percent of the terrestrial landscape and store approximately 68 percent of the landscape soil organic carbon. The heterogeneous soil carbon stocks in this landscape may be sensitive to key environmental changes, such as shrub expansion and climate change. These environmental drivers could possibly result in a trend toward decreased soil carbon storage and increased release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

ID WATER; PEAT; PEATLANDS
AB Cutover bogs do not return to functional peatland ecosystems after abandonment because re-establishment of peat-forming mosses is poor. This paper presents a conceptual model of bog disturbance caused by peat harvesting (1942-1972), and the hydrological evolution that occurred after abandonment (1973-1998). Two adjacent bogs of similar size and origin, one harvested and the other essentially undisturbed, provide the basis for understanding what changes occurred. The model is based on historical trends evident from previous surveys of land-use, boa ecology and resource mapping; and from recent hydrological and ecological data that characterize the current condition. Water balance data and historical information suggest that runoff increased and evapotranspiration decreased following drainage, but tended towards pre-disturbance levels following abandonment, as vegetation recolonized the surface and drainage became less efficient over time. Dewatering of soil pores after drainage caused shrinkage and oxidation of the peat and surface subsidence of approximately 80 cm over 57 years. Comparisons with a nearby natural bog suggest that bulk density in the upper 50 cm of cutover peat increased from 0.07 to 0.13 g cm(-3), specific yield declined from 0,14 to 0.07, water table fluctuations were 67% greater, and mean saturated hydraulic conductivity declined from 4.1 x 10(-5) to 1.3 x 10(-5) cm s(-1). More than 25 years after abandonment, Sphagnum mosses were distributed over broad areas but covered less than 15% of the surface. Areas with 'good' Sphagnum regeneration (>10% cover) were strongly correlated with high water tables (mean -22 cm), especially in zones of seasonal groundwater discharge, artefacts of the extraction history. Forest cover expanded from 5 to 20% of the study area following abandonment. The effect of forest growth (transpiration and interception) and drainage on lowering water levels eventually will be countered by slower water movement through the increasingly dense soil, and by natural ditch deterioration. However, without management intervention, full re-establishment of natural hydrological functions will take a very long time. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Soils of the high latitudes are expected to respond sensitively to climate change, but still little is known about carbon and nitrogen variability in them. We investigated the 0.44-km(2) Little Grawijka Creek catchment of the forest tundra ecotone (northern Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russian Federation) in order (i) to relate the active-layer thickness to controlling environmental factors, (ii) to quantify soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (NT) stocks, and (iii) to assess their variability with respect to different landscape units. The catchment was mapped on a 50 x 50 m grid for topography, dominant tree and ground vegetation, organic-layer and moss-layer thickness, and active-layer thickness. At each grid point, bulk density, and SOC and NT concentrations were determined for depth increments. At three selected plots, 2-m deep soil cores were taken and analysed for SOC, NT and C-14. A shallow active layer was found in intact raised bogs at plateaux situations and in mineral soils of north-northeast (NNE) aspect. Good drainage and greater solar insolation on the south-southwest (SSW) slopes are reflected in deeper active layers or lack of permafrost. Organic carbon stocks to a soil depth of 90 cm varied between 5 and 95 kg m(-2). The greatest stocks were found in the intact raised bogs and on the NNE slopes. Canonical correspondence analysis indicates the dominant role of active-layer thickness for SOC and NT storage. The 2-m soil cores suggest that permafrost soils store about the same amount of SOC from 90 to 200 cm as in the upper 90 cm. Most of this deep SOC pool was formed in the mid-Holocene (organic soils) and the late Pleistocene (mineral soils). Our results showed that even within a small catchment of the forest tundra, active-layer thickness and, hence, SOC and NT storage vary greatly within the landscape mosaic. This has to be taken into account when using upscaling methods such as remote sensing for assessing SOC and NT storage and cycling at a regional to continental level.

DE bogflows; blanket peat; mass movements; liquid limit
ID FLOW; BRITISH
AB Catastrophic failures of blanket bogs, involving the escape and outflow of large volumes of semi-liquid basal peat, are well-known phenomena in Ireland but have only very rarely been reported from elsewhere in the world. Their precise causes and mechanisms are as yet unclear. The liquid limit (WO was identified as a potentially useful indicator of the susceptibility of peat to such failure because peat has extremely high natural water contents and, as an index property, w(L) takes no account of the properties or structures of highly heterogeneous intact peat. However, the usual procedure for determining the wL of peat is not fully standardised. Prepared samples will normally include potentially highly reactive particles of disrupted fibres and wood fragments that would not be present in such freshly disintegrated form in the field. This paper presents results from wL determinations of peat obtained from the scar margins of three bog failures in northwest Ireland, using four different test procedures including a method involving wet-sieving of the peat to separate the humified < 425-mu m fraction for testing without incorporating artificially fragmented particles of fibres. The sampled peat was classified as H-8-H-10 according to the von Post humification scale. The fibre contents varied between the sites, but the ash contents were < 3% in all but one test sample, and bulk densities (dry and field-wet) of the peat from all three sites were almost identical. w(L) results from the wet-sieving method were 708-785%, compared with 633-980% from the standard method. The highest measured field water contents exceeded the wet-sieved wL for all three of the field sites. Tests of cone penetration into intact peat cores demonstrated the influence of the reinforcing effect of in situ fibres. The results strongly suggest the need to adopt a fully standardised procedure for determining the w(L) of peat. Additional shear vane measurements of intact and remoulded peat from a bog failure in Northern Ireland indicated a very high 'strength sensitivity'. This leads to the suggestion that a slight disturbance of basal peat can lead to a loss of strength that rapidly propagates as local stresses change and cause further remoulding as water contents exceed w(L).

AB Biochar refers to a processed, carbon-rich material made from biomass. This article provides a brief summary on the effects of biochar on container substrate properties and plant growth. Biochar could be produced through pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal carbonization of various feedstocks. Biochar produced through different production conditions and feedstocks affect its properties and how it performs when incorporated in container substrates. Biochar incorporation affects the physical and chemical properties of container substrates, including bulk density, total porosity, container capacity, nutrient availability, pH, electrical conductivity and cation exchange capacity. Biochar could also affect microbial activities. The effects of biochar incorporation on plant growth in container substrates depend on biochar properties, plant type, percentage of biochar applied and other container substrates components mixed with biochar. A review of the literature on the impact of biochar on container-grown plants without other factors (such as irrigation or fertilization rates) indicated that 77.3% of the studies found that certain percentages of biochar addition in container substrates promoted plant growth, and 50% of the studies revealed that plant growth decreased due to certain percentages of biochar incorporation. Most of the plants tested in these studies were herbaceous plants. More plant species should be tested for a broader assessment of the use of biochar. Toxic substances (heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxin) in biochars used in container substrates has rarely been studied. Caution is needed when selecting feedstocks and setting up biochar production conditions, which might cause toxic contaminants in the biochar products that could have negative effects on plant growth.

AB In coastal Louisiana, large sediment diversions from the Mississippi and Alchafalaya Rivers have been planned to enhance marsh accretion and productivity and reverse an overall deterioration of coastal marshes. Located between these rivers, there are extensive buoyant marshes in the freshwater and oligohaline zones (about 70% of the vegetated area), and little information exists on how buoyant substrates respond to mineral sediment introduction. The purpose of this study was to understand the vertical movement (buoyancy) and substrate properties of oligohaline marshes with increasing distance from the Atchafalaya River-Fourleague Bay system, a significant mineral sediment source. To do this thirty-seven stations were established (within a study area of 125 km(2)) where vertical marsh movement and marsh hydrology were monitored for a year, and soil cores were collected and analyzed for bulk properties. With increasing distance inland from the sediment source, there were significant increases in vertical movement of the marsh mat and decreasing mineral sediment content in the soil profile. In the interior marshes farthest from the sediment source, the average mat movement was greater than 15 cm, and some sites exceeded 25 cm. Non-buoyant marshes with high substrate bulk density were located closest to the sediment source. Mineral sediment deposition appeared to be a discontinuous process controlled by large events such as hurricanes and tropical storms, rather than average yearly flood events. A comparison of our data (from oligohaline marshes) with other studies (from freshwater marshes) suggests that increases of mineral matter within the upper peat matrix may decrease the vertical movement of marsh substrates.

AB This paper reports on research designed to investigate the capacities of different highly characterized peats to remove odorous compounds from liquid swine manure (LSM). Feat types representing a wide range of properties were tested in order to establish which chemical and physical properties might be most indicative of their capacities to remediate odors produced by LSM. Eight percent slurries (of peat/LSM) were measured for odor changes after 24 hours using odor panel and GC/MS-Solid-phase microextraction (GC/MS-SPME) analysis.
   The GC/MS-SPME and odor panel results indicated that, although all peats tested in this study were found to be effective at removing odor-causing compounds found in LSM, some peats tended to work better than others. Overall, the peats that were the most effective at removing odor-causing compounds tended to have lower bulk densities, ash contents, fulvic acids contents, and guaiacyl lignins contents,and higher water holding capacities, hydraulic conductivities, "total other lignins" contents, hydrogen contents, carbon contents, and total cellulose contents.
   GC/MS-SPME analysis was found to be a reasonably inexpensive and efficient way of conducting this type of research. It allows one to identify a large number of the odor-causing compounds found in LSM, and more importantly, to detect with some precision specific differences in the amounts of these compounds between peat types.

AB The low-Arctic region of western Hudson Bay in interior Canada is one of the most poorly described areas of North America in terms of Holocene climate history. Here, we present new data from a well-dated lake sediment core from northern Manitoba, Canada. We assemble one of the richest multi-proxy datasets to date for a low-Arctic lake and characterize terrestrial and lake processes and exchanges between them. These proxies include fossil pollen and diatom assemblages, charcoal, magnetic properties (susceptibility and remanance), mineral grain size, bulk density, organic-matter content, elemental geochemistry, sediment cation (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+/Fe3+) and macronutrient (P, N, C) contents, biogenic-silica content, basal peat dates (wetland initiation), and stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15). The sediment proxies record both broad- and fine-scale (millennial and sub-millennial) climate change. We find indirect evidence for a cool and dry post-glacial period from 9,000 to 6,500 cal yr BP, a warm and moist mid-Holocene period from 6,500 to 2,500 cal yr BP, and a cool and moist late-Holocene period from 2,500 cal yr BP to present. High-resolution geochemical data suggests 300- to 500-year-long dry periods at similar to 6,500-6,100, 5,300-5,000, 3,300-2,800, and 400-0 cal yr BP. These results suggest that terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem dynamics in the western Hudson Bay region are sensitive to past climate change and are likely to respond to future changes in temperature and precipitation.

AB The present study aimed to analyse the potential of six Deoiled cakes (DOCs) (2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10% (v/v)) and Paddy straw (PS) (10% (v/v)) as potting media (PM) amendments and its subsequent effect on the physical and nutritional properties of the PM and plant health. The study focussed on two transplantable horticulture crops, cucumber (Cucumis sativusL.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicumL.) using coir pith (CP) and vermicompost (VC) as the base material of PM. Among 6 DOCs tested, neem (2.5%) and niger cake (5%) were found to be significant in improving the plant growth of both the crops tested. Further, PS powder amendment to selected PM improved the plant growth, up to 10% (v/v). However, at higher concentrations, PS amendment recorded decreased shoot and root length. Two optimized potting media, DPM-1 (CP + VC + Neem cake + PS:77.5 + 10 + 2.5 + 10% (v/v)) and DPM-2 (CP + VC + Niger cake + PS:75 + 10 + 5 + 10% (v/v)) were evaluated in comparison to peat-based two commercial potting media (CPM-1 and CPM-2). DPM-1 and DPM-2 recorded, bulk density (0.29 and 0.28 g/cm(3)), water holding capacity (59.87 and 59.02%), and % solid (16.63 and 15.37%), air porosity (23.50 and 25.61%), total porosity (83.37 and 84.63%), Ec (2.64 and 2.76 mS/cm), and pH (6.56 and 6.40), respectively. However, all these parameters were within the recommended range of ideal PM. Tomato and cucumber seedlings were grown in both DPMs showed significant improvement in growth and macro and micronutrients in comparison to CPMs and control.

AB This experiment was designed to characterize the physical and chemical properties of six crop's media obtained by mixing different percentages (v/v) of peat, perlite, coconut coir dust, and vermicompost (end-product of the breakdown of organic matter of crop residues mixed with re-used coconut coir dust by Eisenia fetida) and to evaluate the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. cumquat) seedling growth in this media. The treatments were: T1 (75% peat and 25% perlite), T2 (25% peat, 25% coconut coir dust, 25% vermicompost and 25% perlite), T3 (50% peat, 25% vermicompost and 25% perlite), T4 (25% peat, 50% vermicompost and 25% perlite), T5 (50% coconut coir dust, 25% vermicompost and 25% perlite), T6 (25% coconut coir dust, 50% vermicompost and 25% perlite). The electrical conductivity, pH, bulk density and water-soluble elements, contained in the substrate, increased with increasing amounts of vermicompost in the substrate, whereas the total porosity, easily available water and total water holding capacity decreased significantly with increasing amounts of vermicompost. Stem length and leaf area of tomato seedlings were higher in the substrate without vermicompost (T1) but no significant differences were found between substrates with vermicompost. No significant difference was found in the production of roots dry weight in all treatments; this is a very important result, because good quality of root system is the main goal in seedbeds. There are not clear relationships between the increase of vermicompost in mixtures and nutrient contents in stems and leaves.

AB A laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the effect of compost amendment on mobility and leaching potential of heavy metals, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from a peat-based commercial container medium containing 700 g kg(-1) peat, 200 g kg(-1) perlite and 100 g kg(-1) vermiculite at varying amendment rates of compost (0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 L L-1). Increasing compost amendment significantly and linearly increased the pH (P < 0.01), the total concentrations of organic carbon (P < 0.05), copper (Cu) (P < 0.01), cadmium (Cd) (P < 0.01), and lead (Pb) (P < 0.01), and increased the bulk density (P < 0.01) of the medium. The electrical conductivity (EC), and total N and P of the medium increased significantly (P < 0.01) and quadratically with increasing compost amendment. The relationship of the C/N ratio of the medium with the compost amendment rate was decreasing, significant (P < 0.01) and cubic, while that of the total Zn was increasing, significant (P < 0.01) and cubic. Extractable P, NO3-N, and NH4-N increased initially with an increasing compost amendment of up to 0.50 L L-1 and then decreased with further increasing compost rate. Increasing compost rates resulted in a highly significant (P < 0.01) and linear increase in total Cd, Cu, and Pb, and a highly significant (P < 0.01) and cubic increase in total Zn in the medium. Increasing compost rates also significantly (P < 0.01) increased extractable Cu (linearly) and Zn (quadratically), but significantly (P < 0.01) decreased extractable Pb (linearly). There was no significant effect of compost amendment on the extractable Cd concentration in the medium. However, with increasing compost rates from 0.25 to 1.00 L L-1, extractability of P, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn (extractable concentration as a percent of total) was decreased, indicating that compost amendment could lower the leachability of these elements from the medium.

AB This study was conducted in order to examine the potential use of nutrient-rich biosolid in combination with crop residues on the growth of ornamental plants that aims to increase sustainable waste resource recovery and reuse. Locally available crop residues namely, hazelnut husk (HHC), rice hull (RHC), corn straw (CSC) and sawdust (SWC), were composted by mixing with municipal wastewater biosolid (1:1 v/v). After 6-month composting, four different growth media were prepared. The suitability of each growth medium was evaluated by comparing their properties to standard peat and by measuring the plant growth parameters of two well-known ornamental species, Cupressus macrocarpa and Thuja occidentalis, over two consecutive years. The growing experiments were performed in a commercial producer greenhouse and the plants were grown under conditions similar to those used by growers. The key physical and physicochemical properties of the growth media, such as bulk density, porosity, air porosity, water holding capacity, biological stability, pH, EC and organic matter were within the acceptable ranges. Pearson's correlations and stepwise regression analysis indicated that nutrient properties, such as carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, cation exchange capacity, humification index, and total phosphorus and potassium, were most influential on plant growth parameters. The calculated comprehensive growth index values for C. macrocarpa (0.86, 0.89 and 0.78) and T. occidentalis (0.77, 0.71 and 0.74) for HHC, SWC and peat medium, respectively, were higher than RHC and CSC. This study proves that biologically stable crop residues with biosolid could be used as a growth medium and shows that peat could be successfully replaced by HHC and SWC.

AB The residues of the aquatic plant Posidonia oceanica that are washed ashore, thereby causing environmental problems in coastal areas, can be used as growing media in horticulture. In the present study, the hydraulic characteristics of raw or composted Posidonia residues, coir, and their 1:1 blends (v/v) with pumice were determined, and their agronomic performance was evaluated in a lettuce crop. The mixture of all three substrates with pumice reduced their effective pore space and increased their bulk density. Furthermore, the water and air capacity (determined at a suction 01 10 cm) and the easily available water were also reduced by mixing the three tested media with pumice. The relative hydraulic conductivity (K,) decreased with increasing suction (4)) in all of the tested media. The highest and the lowest rates of K-r decrease with increasing 41 were observed in the mix of non-composted Posidonia with pumice and in 100% composted Posidonia, respectively. Blending composted or non-composted Posidonia with pumice at a 1:1 ratio raised the rate of K-r decrease with increasing 41 in comparison with 100% composted or 100% non-composted Posidonia, respectively. In contrast, blending coir with pumice reduced the rate of K decrease with increasing psi in comparison with 100% coir. The differences in the mean fresh weight between lettuce plants grown on the six growing media were similar with those in the rate of K-r decrease with increasing psi. These results indicate that the crucial factor for the yield performance of lettuce grown on the tested growing media was not the air but the water availability. Furthermore, the present results indicate that the actual water availability to plants grown on the tested substrates depends much more on water flux toward roots and concomitantly on their hydraulic conductivity than on the easily available water (i.e., the difference in water content between 10 and 50 cm suction).

AB A significant example of circular economy application concept is the recycling of wastes through co-composting to obtain techno-soils and composts. The objective of this paper was to demonstrate that the co-composting ofPosidonia oceanicaresidues with decontaminated sediments is an effective method to manage two kinds of waste and transform them in a suitable material for the preparation of growth substrates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the co-composting process, a protocol, involving physical-chemical, biochemical, and toxicological parameters, has been followed. Moreover, to evaluate the quality of the different Posidonia-based composts, the characteristics have been compared with threshold values proposed in the Italian regulation for plant growth substrates and to specific parameters from the scientific literature. All the obtained composts responded to the main characteristics for composting and growing media preparation provided in national and international regulations, in terms of pH (6.7-7.6), electrical conductivity (0.13-0.30 dS/m), and total organic carbon content (6.62-27.9 C%). Moreover, results about humic carbon (16.6-21.9 C%), germination index (139-158%), enzymatic activities (B-glucosidase: 3538-5367 mmol MUB/kg ds H), bulk density (0.30-0.83 g/cm(3)), and cation exchange capacity (43.3-126 meq/100 g ds) proved the quality of theP. oceanicaand sediment based composts. These results are an endorsement of Posidonia with sediment-based composts use as a constituent of techno-soils and, as a component for the preparation of nursery growth substrate. It is possible to claim that the co-composting process is an alternative management strategy for decontaminated sediments andP. oceanicaresidues to be recommended. Adequate policies are needed in order to recyclePosidonia oceanicaresidues and decontaminated sediments, namely two kinds of waste, into a secondary raw material, namely techno-soil, thus implementing the concept of the circular economy.

AB The real contribution of composts to N availability depends on their characteristics and maturity. A laboratory incubation experiment (140 d) was conducted parallel to a greenhouse study (330 d) in a split-split-plot design, with, respectively, two peat rates (0, 20 g kg(-1) soil), five manure composts and four compost rates (0, 250, 500 and 750 g kg(-1) soil). Compost N mineralization, orchardgrass (Dactylis Glomerata L.) yield and N uptake were measured. Total amount of mineralized N and yields and N uptake for six cuts of orchardgrass varied significantly with the type of composts and rate. Feat addition temporarily decreased compost N mineralization rate but significantly increased orchardgrass yields and N uptake as compared to peatless treatments. Mineralized N represented <3% of total N, whereas N uptake by orchardgrass represented 13-40% of total N among composts. This low mineralized N value compared to total N and total N uptake was due to a high maturity of the composts studied. This was shown by high humic acid : fulvic acid fraction ratios (3.1 to 4.8) and low non-humic fraction:humic acid+fulvic acid ratios (0.10 to 0.12), as well as low C/N ratios, high bulk density, high ash content, pH, NO3-N and CEC values. Even if peat addition decreased mineralized N basically due to temporary N immobilization, its application significantly increased yields and N uptake probably by improving physical conditions in soil-manure compost mixtures. Feat addition to mature manure composts should be considered as an interesting alternative for horticultural plants sensitive to high NO3-N content from mature composts.

AB Over the past century, mires and peatlands have faced a wide range of degradation by artificial drainage, making them one of the most threatened ecosystems in Europe. However, restoration of drained peatlands has gained much importance over the last three decades, mostly due to the multiple ecosystem services they provide such as carbon storage, habitat provision and water flow regulation. Although there has been an increased focus on such ecosystems, spatial research on hydrophysical soil properties following rewetting in coastal mires is lacking. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to understand the spatial structures of hydrophysical properties of organic soils and spatial patterns of organic matter accumulation in relation to soil surface microtopography. Soil organic matter content (SOM) and hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of topsoils (0-28 cm), along with soil textures of the underlying mineral substrate, were investigated in a rewetted non-tidal coastal flood mire (Baltic Sea). The results indicate that the organic horizon with its relatively low K-s acts as a hydrological barrier to infiltration. Soil organic matter content (SOM), K-s and soil surface microtopography are all spatially auto-correlated within 100, 87 and 53 m, respectively. Bivariate Moran's I revealed a positive but weak spatial correlation between SOM and K-s and a moderately strong negative spatial correlation between SOM and soil surface microtopography. A map of SOM was generated using simple kriging, which predicts higher SOM in the centre of the ecosystem, at lower elevations; and lower SOM at the edges of the study area, at higher elevations. Local depressions in the centre of the ecosystem provide a wetter and therefore more anaerobic environment, thereby decreasing carbon mineralisation rates and enabling peat accumulation. The low hydraulic conductivity of the degraded peat in the presence of lower micro-elevations in the centre of the ecosystem is likely to increase the residence time of floodwater and thus may enhance (new) peat accumulation. Thus, we conclude that, for the restoration of non-tidal coastal mires where flooding events are not as frequent, K-s and soil surface microtopography are even more important factors to consider than for tidal systems.

AB The determination of the total carbon storage of peatlands is of high relevance in the context of climate-change mitigation efforts. This determination relies on data about stratigraphy and peat properties, which are conventionally collected by coring. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) can support these point data by providing subsoil information in two-dimensional cross-sections. In this study, GPR and ERI were conducted at two groundwater-fed fen sites located in the temperate zone in north-east Germany. The fens of this region are embedded in low conductive glacial sand and are characterised by thick layers of gyttja, which can be either mineral or organic. The two study sites are representative of this region with respect to stratigraphy (total thickness, peat and gyttja types) and ecological conditions (pH-value, trophic condition). The aim of this study is to assess the suitability of GPR and ERI to detect stratigraphy and peat properties under these characteristic site conditions.
   Results show that GPR clearly detects the interfaces between (i) Carex and brown-moss peat, (ii) brown-moss peat and organic gyttja, (iii) organic- and mineral gyttja, and (iv) mineral gyttja and the parent material (glacial sand). These layers differ in bulk density and the related organic matter content. ERI, however, does not delineate these layers; rather it delineates regions of varying properties. At our base-rich site, pore fluid conductivity and cation.exchange capacity are the main factors that determine peat electrical conductivity (reverse of resistivity), whereas organic matter and water content are most influential at the more acidic site. Thus the correlation between peat properties and electrical conductivity are driven by site-specific conditions, which are mainly determined by the solute load in the groundwater at fens. When the total organic deposits exceed a thickness of 5 m, the depth of investigation by GPR is limited due to increasing attenuation. This is not a limiting factor for ERI, where the transition from organic deposits to glacial sand is visible at both sites. Due to these specific sensitivities, a combined application of GPR and ERI meets the demand for up-to-date information on carbon storage of peatlands, which is, moreover, very site-specific because of the inherent variety of ecological conditions and stratigraphy between peatlands in general and between fens and bogs in particular.

AB Computed tomography (CT) imaging has been used to describe and quantify subtidal, benthic animals such as polychaetes, amphipods, and shrimp. Here, for the first time, CT imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the CT images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. CT imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the CT-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat wet mass. Using CT imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10-20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. CT imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.

AB Two 50 - cm long peat cores from the Hani mire on the western slope of the Changbai Mountains, northeastern China, were collected for investigating physical, biological and geochemical processes of the peatland in response to recent climate change. The C-14 dating using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on the peat cores provides "a nuclear bomb carbon curve" which is used for peat chronological construction. The sedimentation rate (SR) of Core S1 from a Sphagnum magenllanicum hummock in the Hani mire was about 0.98 cm/y and deposited from 1957-2008 CE, whereas the SR of Core S2 from S. palustre hummock (1 km apart from S1) was 1.59 cm/y and accumulated during 1976-2008. The discrepancy of the SRs may mainly be attributed to the different inorganic material supplies from surface runoff which affected growth of Sphagnum spp. at different sites, with lower rate corresponding to higher inorganic contents (higher Ti, Ca and Mg contents thus lower values of loss on ignition, LOI%). On the other hand, the two cores had similar values and variation trends in the pH, C/N, N and P contents, and dry bulk density (DBD), implying that the organic source and decomposition were similar under the same climatic conditions. The variations of TOC%, C/N and Pb content in the peat cores matched well with the 5-y running average of local annual precipitation record, with higher TOC% and C/N but lower Pb content corresponding to higher rainfall; and vice versa. These properties in the meso-oligotrophic peat sequences can reflect climatic changes. The recent rates of carbon accumulation (RERCA) for S1 and S2 calculated from the TOC%, DBD and SR were averaged 121.6 +/- 24.3 and 175.5 +/- 35.1 g/m(2)/y, respectively.

AB Pine sawdust and bark, wood waste products of the forest industry, can be used as substrate and substitute peat moss in the production of nursery plants. Therefore, growth of Pinus montezumae Lamb. seedlings was assessed in containers with substrates composed of pine bark and sawdust, which were used to form nine mixtures. There was also a control treatment (60 % peat moss+ 20 % perlite + 20 % vermiculite). Physical and chemical characteristics were determined. pH oscillated between 4.2 and 6.3, electrical conductivity was 0.25 to 3.98 dSm(-1) total porosity was 69 to 81 %, aeration porosity was 26 to 34 %, water holding porosity was 36 to 52 %, and bulk density was 0.17 to 0.32 g cm(-3). On the water release curve, available water varied from 8 to 46 %, easily available water 6 to 19 %, reserve water 3 to 8 %, and less readily available water 18 to 37 % in all treatments. There were significant differences among treatments in seedling growth at 10 months of age: diameter varied from 9.7 to 11.5 mm, shoot dry weight 1.97 to 2.87 g, and root dry weight 3.51 to 61.05 g. The shoot/root ratio in all of the treatments was 1 to 2.5. The mixtures supporting growth similar to the control and adequate physical characteristics for producing plants of this species were T9 (sawdust 70 % + peat 10 % + perlite 10 % + vermiculite 10 %) and T1 (bark 10% + sawdust 70% + perlite 10 % + vermiculite 10 %). The mixtures of sawdust and bark generated plants with dimensions appropriate for transplant to the field. This allows to eliminate the utilization of peat moss as substrate in the production of forest plants.

AB Recent deposition of atmospheric soil dust (ASD) was studied using (210)pb-dated Sphagnum-derived peat sequences from Great Hinggan Mountain in northeast China. Physicochemical indices of peat including dry bulk density, water content, ash content, total organic carbon and mass magnetic susceptibility were measured. Acid-insoluble concentration of lithogenic metals (Al, Ca, Fe, Mn, V and Ti) were measured using ICP-AES. The basic physicochemical properties were used to assess the peat trophic status and indicated that the sections above 45-60 cm are rain-fed peat. A continuous record of ASD fluxes over the past 150 years was reconstructed based on the geochemical data obtained from the ombrotrophic zone, and the average input rate of ASD is 13.4-68.1 g m(-2) year(-1). The source of soil dust deposited in peat was dominated by the long-range transport of mineral aerosol from the drylands in north China and Mongolia. The temporal variation of ASD fluxes in the last 60 years coincides well with the meteorological records of dust storm frequency during 1954-2002 in north China. This suggests that the reconstructed sequence of atmospheric dust deposition is reliable and we can look back in time at the dust evolution before 1949. Dust storm events were observed occasionally in the late Qing dynasty, and their frequency and intensity were smaller than dust weather occurring in recent times. Four peaks of ASD fluxes were distinguished and correlated with the historical events at that time. This study presents the first atmospheric soil dust data in peat records in northeast China, and complements a global database of peat bog archives of atmospheric deposition. The results reflect the patterns of local environmental change over the past century in north China and will be helpful in formulating policies to achieve sustainable and healthy development.

AB Wetland soils are an important component of the Global Carbon Cycle because they store about 20-25% of the terrestrial soil organic carbon (SOC). Wetlands occupy about 6% of the global land surface and any change in their use or management has potentially dramatic consequences on greenhouse gases emissions. However, the capacity of wetland soils to store carbon (C) differs from place to place due to reasons still not well understood. The objective of this review was to evaluate the global variations in wetlands SOC content (SOCc) and to relate it to key soil and environmental factors such as soil texture, intensity of soil hydromorphy, metallic element content and climate. A comprehensive data analysis was performed using 122 soil profiles from 29 studies performed under temperate, humid, sub-humid, tropical and sub-arctic conditions. The results point to average SOCc of 53.5 +/- 15.8 g C kg(-1) with a maximum of 540 g C kg(-1). SOCc increased with increase in intensity of soil hydromorphy (r = - 0.52), Al (r = 0.19) and Fe content (r = 0.21), and decreased with soil pH (r = - 0.24). There was also a surprising tendency for intensity of soil hydromorphy, and thus SOCc, to decrease with increasing mean annual precipitation and soil clay content. These results contribute to a better understanding of the impact of soil hydromorphy in wetlands on organic C stabilization in the soils. However, further studies with additional information on soil bulk density to assess carbon C stocks, still need to be performed.

AB In the Mediterranean region, olive-stone waste (OSW) is accumulated and considered of environmental and human health constraints. In this study, OSW was used for peat (P) replacement in growing media for Brassica seedling production. Cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage were seeded in growing media consisted of 0-20-40-60% OSW. The mixture of OSW with peat increased growing media bulk density and reduced the total pore space and available water and air at root system. A Considerable amount of minerals were provided into the growing media with the OSW, while their availability was increased with the raised pH values. Seed emergence percentage decreased with high ratio of OSW which also increased mean emergence time. The addition of OSW decreased plant height, leaf number, and fresh weight in all three examined species. The OSW decreased stomatal conductance (in cauliflower and cabbage) and chlorophylls content (including broccoli). The insertion of OSW affected the mineral accumulation in plants with decreases in nitrogen and sodium content and increases in potassium and calcium. OSW increased to some extent for cauliflower and broccoli or unchanged for cabbage polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity (ABTS, FRAP). Cellular damage was caused by the addition of OSW by increasing the lipid peroxidation and the production of hydrogen peroxide, and as a consequence, the plant antioxidative (catalase, superoxide dismutase) enzyme metabolism increased. The current study demonstrates that up to 20% of OSW can substitute peat for cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage seedling production while cabbage was performed better under the increased OSW-caused stress.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine how drainage impacts carbon densities and recent rates (past 50years) of vertical accretion and carbon accumulation in southeastern forested peatlands. We compared these parameters in drained maple-gum (MAPL), Atlantic white cedar (CDR), and pocosin (POC) communities in the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GDS) of Virginia/North Carolina and in an intact (undrained) CDR swamp in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (AR) of North Carolina. Peat cores were analyzed for bulk density, percent organic carbon, and Cs-137 and Pb-210. An uncertainty analysis of both Cs-137 and Pb-210 approaches was used to constrain error at least partially related to mobility of both radioisotopes. GDS peats had lower porosities (89.6% (SD=1.71) versus 95.3% (0.18)) and higher carbon densities (0.082 (0.021) versus 0.037 (0.009)gCcm(-3)) than AR. Vertical accretion rates (0.10-0.56cmyr(-1)) were used to estimate a time period of similar to 84-362years for reestablishment of peat lost during the 2011 Lateral West fire at the GDS. Carbon accumulation rates ranged from 51 to 389gCm(-2)yr(-1) for all sites. In the drained (GDS) versus intact (AR) CDR sites, carbon accumulation rates were similar with Cs-137 (87(GDS) versus 92(AR)gCm(-2)yr(-1)) and somewhat less at the GDS than AR as determined with Pb-210 (111(GDS) versus 159(AR)gCm(-2)yr(-1)). Heightened productivity and high polyphenol content of peat may be responsible for similar rates of carbon accumulation in both drained and intact CDR peatlands.

AB We present a case study of a bog showing how an integrated approach of multi-method geophysical sounding and local soil sampling can be used to identify, differentiate, and map organic sediments. Our study is based on ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and shear-wave seismic (SH seismic) profiling applied to sediments of the former Lake Duvensee (northern Germany), nowadays a bog. This is a well-known locality for remains from the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers' occupation that has been attracting archaeological and geoarchaeological research for100 years. The bog is embedded in low conductive glacial sand and is characterized by layers of different gyttja sediments (detritus and calcareous). The present study was conducted in order to identify the bog morphology and the thickness of the peat body and lake sediments, in order to understand the basin evolution. To validate the geophysical results, derived from surface measurements, drilling, soil analyses as well as borehole guided wave analysis of electromagnetic waves and Direct-Push (DP-EC) have been carried out and used for comparison. It turned out that each method can distinguish between sediments that differ in grain size, particularly between peat, lake sediments (gyttjas and mud) and basal glacial sand deposits. GPR is even able to separate between strongly and weakly decomposed peat layers, which is also clear considering resistivity variations in the ERT computation. From the association between geophysical properties and sediment analysis (e.g., water content and organic matter) different gyttjas were distinguished (coarse and fine) and seismic velocity was correlated to bulk density. Moreover, GPR and SH-wave seismics present different resolutions, confirming that the latter allows measurements, which are more focused on determining the extension of basal sand deposits, the depth of which is difficult to reach with GPR. Representative values of electrical resistivity, dielectric permittivity, and shear wave velocity have been determined for each sediment type and are therefore available to complete the investigation of wetland environments. Fine grained lake sediments were difficult to differentiate by the applied methods. This could be a result of high ionic concentration within the permanent groundwater body, partly masking the sediment properties.

AB Background and aims In forestry-drained peatlands, drying leads to changes in C cycling which could affect peat delta C-13. Furthermore, the delta C-13 profile of the entire peat column may reveal effects of earlier climatic periods. Methods We measured peat delta C-13 and C inventories in adjacent peat profiles, two collected from undrained and two from the drained side of a bog that was partially ditch-drained 37 years earlier. The cores were sliced into 10-cm subsamples for analyses; matching of the profiles based on surface levelling, peat stratigraphic correlation and a horizontal ash layer found in both profiles. Results Surface subsidence of 30 cm was observed in the dried site and the uppermost 160 cm in the undrained site contained an excess of 5.9 kg m(-2) of C compared with the corresponding strata of the ditch-drained site. The delta C-13 values increased but markedly only in the thin surface layer of the drained site, indicating low delta C-13 of the missing C (ca. -30 parts per thousand). In the deeper strata, dating to Mid-Holocene, high dry bulk density, C%, N%, humification index and low C/N ratio were connected to low delta C-13 of peat. Conclusions Drainage of 37 years increased delta C-13 values in the upper peat profile of the drained bog and led to the selective loss of C-13 depleted C. Results indicate that C balance studies can be aided by C isotope analyses. Low delta C-13 values in the peat profile indicate the existence of a wet fen stage during the moist and warm period during Mid-Holocene.

AB There are two contrasting types of wetlands in Belize: marl- and sand-based marshes. We measured accumulation rates of sediment in six cores from marl- and sand-based marshes of northern Belize and compared biogeochemical characteristics to assess recent wetland history ( similar to 1850 to present). Sediment depth increments were analysed for bulk density, LOI, nutrients (C, N, P, S, Ca, Mg, K and Na) and snail shell density and species diversity. Cores were dated using Pb-210 and a constant rate of supply model. Unsupported Pb-210 inventories of the cores ranged from 6.16 to 8.92 pCi cm(-2). Marl-based marshes showed the maximum peak of Pb-210 activity from 4 to 10 cm below the sediment surface. Pb-210 peaks corresponded with the bottom of a marl layer containing chlorophyll a and we suggest that this relationship reflects the high growth and decomposition rates of cyanobacterial mat. Inorganic carbon, Ca, Mg, K, Na, S and Pb contents and accumulation rates were much greater in the marl-based marshes than in the sand-based marshes. Average dry mass accumulation rates in the six marshes ranged from 113 to 572 g m(-2) year(-1) over the past 100 years. Average linear sedimentation rates during the last 100 years in the two types were not significantly different (0.93 and 1.08 mm year(-1), respectively). Increased sediment accumulation by human activities such as soil washout from adjacent roads was recorded in a sand-based marsh near roads. Sediment cores in the marl-based marshes display changes of marsh vegetation, apparently caused by water level changes. The vegetation change occurred at the end of the 1800s and the beginning of 1900s and is represented by a band of dark peat in otherwise marl-dominated sediments. Overall, the sediment cores show that conditions were relatively undisturbed by human activities in the recent past. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB Improved soil quality is required to sustainably achieve food security. Although the recycling of organic materials to fields is considered a key practice for improving soil quality, the effects of this procedure on productivity shows inconsistent results from strongly positive to negative. A long-term field experiment was conducted over six crop seasons to test the hypothesis that large improvements in grain yield and soil quality of organic recycling could be achieved under high-yielding management practices. The performance parameters of crop and soil were examined after applying two different organic amendment treatments: the continual application of manure in each season (chemical fertilizer [CF] + manure), and one application of a large volume of peat and vermiculite (PV; CF + PV); controls received CF only. All three treatments were applied at an optimal N rate with high-yield management procedures. Treatments with organic soil amendments increased grain yields by 2.5-2.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared with CF alone. These high-yield plots had higher levels of soil organic carbon (65.3-111.0% higher), less bulk density (7.2-13.8% lower), and a larger proportion of macroaggregates in the topsoil. Compared with CF + manure treatment, the CF + PV produced similarly improved yields and soil properties, but the soil microbial biomass carbon and microbial community structure (including richness and diversity) differed between treatments. The recycling of organic materials was found to reduce farm profitability due to increases in material costs and labour. Our study provides an opportunity to increase both productivity and soil quality under integrated management, and the data will help adequately inform policies and strategic plans for food security and land use.

AB The Cube Method (CM) and the Modified Cube Method (MCM) were developed for measuring vertical (K-v) and horizontal (K-h) saturated hydraulic conductivity of a single soil sample. By these methods, a cube of soil is carved out in situ and a suitable material is applied to enclose the cube in a tightly fitting casing before moving the sample to the laboratory. Problems may be associated with the use of gypsum, originally used to encase soil. The suitability of molten wax and expandable polyurethane foam to encase a soil cube was tested for a sandy-loam soil. Wax-treated samples yielded lower conductivity results than untreated samples by a maximum factor of 3.7. The observed discrepancies were attributed, at least in part, to soil pore obstruction phenomena caused by wax. Using foam to fill a gap 60% full and partially preventing leakage of expanded foam from the gap was found to be appropriate to reach the following objectives: (i) filling completely the gap after foam expansion, (ii) preventing flow at the boundary between the foam cast and a smooth surface, (iii) minimizing both dry and wet soil compaction phenomena during foam expansion, (iv) minimizing foam intrusion into exposed pores of 1.0 x 10(-3) to 3.0 x 10(-3) m (intrusion depth <= 2.0 x 10(-3) m), and (v) allowing removal of any intrusion by the detachment of the set foam from the treated surface. Applying foam to collect undisturbed soil samples yielded K-v results (7.41 x 10(-5)-1.67 x 10(-4) m s(-1)) falling in the range of a larger number of previously measured conductivities (2.06 x 10(-5)-2.03 x 10(-4) m s(-1)), and it showed that K-v was 2.3 times larger than K-h. In conclusion, using wax is not recommended to obtain fully representative soil samples. Foam was a promising encasing material for the investigated soil.

AB Water availability is a major concern when restoring degraded vacuum harvested peatlands. The seasonal expression of water arising from the compression of underlying organic deposits may provide a source of water. A bog near Rimouski, Quebec (Canada) was harvested using the vacuum extraction method and cut down to underlying sedge peat; restoration procedures were implemented in the autumn of 2009. The residual peat layer is 0.4-1 m thick, and overlies a 1-1.5 m thick gyttja deposit. Gyttja is a coprogenous lake bottom sediment on which peat sometimes forms. Little is known about the hydrophysical properties of gyttja and the implications it may have for peatland restoration. The upper 40 cm of gyttja had average bulk density 0.12 g cm(-3), particle density 1.57 g cm(-3) and porosity 92 %. The organic matter and fibre contents of the gyttja were > 45 %, and both decreased with depth. Oedometer test results showed 9 and 72 % strain at 3.5 and 200 kPa, respectively, demonstrating the potential for water release upon compression, which in the field is caused by water table lowering. However, during the year of measurement (2011) the changes in effective stress caused by water table lowering were < 1 kPa, corresponding to a water table decline of < 10 cm. Under these conditions the volumetric moisture content of the top 30 cm of gyttja decreased by only 0.4 % and we observed 0.5 cm of gyttja settlement; this represented 0.4 % and 1.7 % strain, respectively. On the basis of these strains, we conclude that the release of water due to the consolidation of gyttja in 2011 had little impact on rewetting of the overlying peat. However, it may be important under drier conditions with a larger seasonal water deficit, and may have been important prior to restoration when larger water table fluctuations were observed.

AB To study the causes of agricultural declines in south-west Sweden, a multi-proxy study including pollen analysis, bog surface wetness indicators and aeolian sediment influx reconstructions was carried out on the Store Mosse Bog, situated on the coastal plain of Halland. Patterns of agricultural changes during the past 6,000 years from this study were compared to one additional site on the coastal plain (Undarsmosse Bog) and to four sites in the forested upland region. First, we compared land use activity on the coastal plain and in upland regions of south-west Sweden. Three periods with reduced agricultural activities were observed, primarily in records from the coastal plain. Next, the causes for these declines were studied by comparing land use indicators in the pollen records from the Store Mosse and Undarsmosse peat bogs to independent climatic reconstructions based on the same core material (past storm activity based on aeolian sediment influx onto the peat bogs; bog surface wetness reconstructed from organic bulk density measurements). Since the climatic reconstructions and pollen analysis were carried out on the same peat cores, a direct comparison between the timing of climatic events and land use changes was possible. Results indicate that climatic perturbations prior to ca. 1,000 years ago contributed to or possibly caused agricultural declines. The agricultural expansions near the Store Mosse and Undarsmosse bogs from 3000 to 2600 cal. yrs b.p. ended at the time when climatic proxy indicators recorded climatic instability (from ca 2600 to 2200 cal. yrs b.p.). The same sequence of events was recorded around 1500 cal. yrs b.p. and from 1200 to 1000 cal. yrs b.p., suggesting a climatic cause for these agricultural declines as well. The well-known climatic perturbations associated with the Little Ice Age, however, did not have a visible impact on agricultural activities. By this time, advances in land use knowledge and technology may have drastically diminished society's sensitivity to climatic changes.

AB Peat soils consist of poorly decomposed plant detritus, preserved by low decay rates, and deep peat deposits are globally significant stores in the carbon cycle. High water tables and low soil temperatures are commonly held to be the primary reasons for low peat decay rates. However, recent studies suggest a thermodynamic limit to peat decay, whereby the slow turnover of peat soil pore water may lead to high concentrations of phenols and dissolved inorganic carbon. In sufficient concentrations, these chemicals may slow or even halt microbial respiration, providing a negative feedback to peat decay. We document the analysis of a simple, one-dimensional theoretical model of peatland pore water residence time distributions (RTDs). The model suggests that broader, thicker peatlands may be more resilient to rapid decay caused by climate change because of slow pore water turnover in deep layers. Even shallow peat deposits may also be resilient to rapid decay if rainfall rates are low. However, the model suggests that even thick peatlands may be vulnerable to rapid decay under prolonged high rainfall rates, which may act to flush pore water with fresh rainwater. We also used the model to illustrate a particular limitation of the diplotelmic (i.e., acrotelm and catotelm) model of peatland structure. Model peatlands of contrasting hydraulic structure exhibited identical water tables but contrasting RTDs. These scenarios would be treated identically by diplotelmic models, although the thermodynamic limit suggests contrasting decay regimes. We therefore conclude that the diplotelmic model be discarded in favor of model schemes that consider continuous variation in peat properties and processes.

AB Peat forming wetlands are globally important sources of the greenhouse gas CH4. The variability of flux recordings from peatlands is however considerable and the distribution of CH4 below the water table poorly described. Surface peat (0-500 mm below the water table) is responsible for the bulk of emissions and a localised region of intense CH4 concentration may exist within this region but the structure of peat and presence of gas bubbles make the determination of in situ gas distributions problematic. We report on the in situ distribution and concentrations of CH4, CO2 and O-2 in surface bog peat cores using Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry and relate this to peat physical structure. Replicate cores collected in spring and autumn from both hollows and hummocks are used (n = 10). CH4 recorded in almost every profile was localised in intense peaks reaching concentrations up to 350 mu M at depths where O-2 was absent. Each CH4 peak had a coincident CO2 peak with a minimum mean ratio of similar to 20:1 (CO2:CH4) and we found more CH4 beneath hollows than hummocks. In statistical comparisons CH4 concentration and distribution differed significantly between profiles for each depth. We demonstrate that variability found within a single core is at least as great as that between cores collected across the bog. The distribution of CH4 was negatively correlated with bulk density and in some cases the location of roots matched those of intense CH4 concentration where bubbles had formed and been trapped. Our comparisons suggest variability in gas distribution is caused by a heterogenous peat structure that controls the movement of gas bubbles and contains localised hotspots of gas production. The small and fine root systems of vascular plants on the peatland surface may cause high levels of methanogenic activity in their vicinity and also represent a physical barrier capable of trapping CH4 bubbles.

AB The gravimetric moisture content of peat is the main factor limiting the ignition and spread propagation of smouldering fires. Our aim is to use controlled laboratory experiments to better understand how the spread of smouldering fires is influenced in natural landscape conditions where the moisture content of the top peat layer is not homogeneous. In this paper, we study for the first time the spread of peat fires across a spatial matrix of two moisture contents (dry/wet) in the laboratory. The experiments were undertaken using an open-top insulated box (22 x 18 x 6 cm) filled with milled peat. The peat was ignited at one side of the box initiating smouldering and horizontal spread. Measurements of the peak temperature inside the peat, fire duration and longwave thermal radiation from the burning samples revealed important local changes of the smouldering behaviour in response to sharp gradients in moisture content. Both, peak temperatures and radiation in wetter peat (after the moisture gradient) were sensitive to the drier moisture condition (preceding the moisture gradient).
   Drier peat conditions before the moisture gradient led to higher temperatures and higher radiation flux from the fire during the first 6 cm of horizontal spread into a wet peat patch. The total spread distance into a wet peat patch was affected by the moisture content gradient. We predicted that in most peat moisture gradients of relevance to natural ecosystems the fire self-extinguishes within the first 10 cm of horizontal spread into a wet peat patch. Spread distances of more than 10 cm are limited to wet peat patches below 160% moisture content (mass of water per mass of dry peat). We found that spatial gradients of moisture content have important local effects on the horizontal spread and should be considered in field and modelling studies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Long-term changes of the acid/base relations of organic soils after drainage, fertilization and/or liming at three experimental sites-two ombrogenous and one soligenous-in southcentral Norway are discussed. These sites were drained, fertilized and/or limed in 1953-1956 and sampled in 1991-1992. Drainage at the ombrogenous sites caused: insignificant shifts of pH, higher bulk densities to 40 cm depth. higher ash percentage, higher contents of N and P to 20 cm depth and reduced concentrations of total Ca, K, Mg, Na, Al and Fe in soil layers deeper than 20 cm. The soligenous site was not effectively drained; despite this, pH dropped about 0.5 unit in the surface and subsurface soil layers of the control plots, while small changes were measured for most other soil variables. The suggested reason for the pH drop is limited sulphide oxidation in the upper 20 cm drained layer. Base saturation at actual soil pH, when all treatments were included, was estimated with good precision by four regressors: pH, extractable Al, extractable Fe and extractable Ca (R-2 = 0.90-0.95). Similar models explained 97-99% of the variation in base saturation at soil pH = 7.0. The lime effects at the properly drained oligotrophic sites were proportional to applied doses; for pH to 40 cm, base saturation to 60 cm, and Ca concentration to 60 cm depth. At the less well-drained soligenous site, effects were limited to the upper 30 cm layer. Both drainage and liming caused higher cation exchange capacities and proper drainage seems to be a prerequisite for the liming effect. Estimated recovery of calcium to 60 cm depth was 64-79% at the ombrogenous sites and 42-46% at the soligenous site.

AB 1. As a consequence of large-scale decreases in the ground water table in western parts of the lower Rhine area, Germany, several Alnus glutinosa fens have undergone distinct changes in species composition and show signs of intensive peat mineralization.
   2. The chemistry of peat and the distribution patterns of vegetation were studied in an affected fen of 6.6 ha. Ground water level, pH of the peat, exchangeable cations, total nitrogen, organic carbon contents and herb layer composition were assessed at each intersection of a rectangular 25 x 25 m grid. The evaluation of individual grid values was performed with a geographical information system (GIS). Isolines and overlays for selected data sets were used to assess extent and direction of change.
   3. The peat of the drained areas showed decreased nitrogen, organic carbon, calcium and magnesium contents and low pH values. In contrast, bulk density and exchangeable aluminium increased in the mineralized peat. Though more than 800 g m(-2) of nitrogen was still found in the upper 10 cm in the wet areas, nitrogen stores diminished to about half this amount in drained peat. The decline in pH values and in calcium and magnesium contents was mainly attributed to H+ production related to nitrogen mineralization.
   4. The evaluation of overlays for selected variables showed a strong relation between the decrease in ground water level and declining cover of Carex acutiformis as well as peat acidification. Increases in exchangeable aluminium were also closely related to peat acidification.
   5. The investigation showed that spatial evaluation of ecological data can be useful for assessment of man-induced ecosystem changes.

AB Growing media are used in a broad range of applications, for which special consideration must be given to their physical and hydraulic character. Because they are relatively fragile, dominantly consisting of dried plant remnants, their preparation, processing, and handling before potting affect their properties. This is complicated by their subsidence and decomposition during use, which leads to a reduction of their initial bulk volume. Organic growing media show many similarities to Histosols because of the common botanical origin of some of their components. For both growing media and Histosols, classical concepts and values related to physical properties like air-filled porosity, bulk density, available water, hydraulic conductivity, gas diffusivity, and field capacity need to be adapted to reflect distinct differences in their composition, structure, and stability compared with mineral soils. Their use in containers with a variety of shapes and sizes influences water and air storage and exchange as well. They can subside extensively as they undergo decomposition. They shrink. Hence, the range of values observed for the physical properties of organic media differs from those of mineral soils. The methods to be used for measuring such properties must be adapted to that specific context of use and to account for their fragile and dynamic nature. Finally, specific norms to guide substrate manufacturing and for diagnosis of plant growth problems have been derived specifically and should be used in such a situation.

AB This study was conducted to develop an artificial soil substitute for existing growing media such as cocopeat and peatmoss. Minerals such as perlite, zeolite, kaolin, illite and silica were chosen as starting materials. Perlite-zeolite-silica-clay composite granules in different compositions were fabricated using the total mixing method and the layered structure method, and their chemical and physical properties, namely, pH, CEC, EC, EAW and WBC, were compared.
   The sample with a spherical layered structure displayed pH values that were 0.3-0.6 lower in all the pH ranges studied and had higher CECs of 40-41 cmol(+)/kg at a calcination temperature of 1000 degrees C than those using the total mixing method. To meet the Korean average pH values of 5.7-6.3 for growing media, FeS2 was tested as a calcination additive to lower the pH of the sample. An addition of 1 wt.% FeS2 could lower the pH from 7.3 to the 5.5-7.0 range, depending on the calcined temperature.
   Improved calcined clay with a spherical layered structure was fabricated under optimum conditions. The clay had sufficient chemical and physical properties, i.e., a pH of 5.8-6.3, a CEC of 38.2-41.0 cmol(+)/kg, an EC of 0.18-0.20 dS/m. an EAW of 12.32-30.89, a WBC of 3.14-15.75, and a bulk density of 1.01-1.08 g/cm(3). We conclude that this improved calcined clay with a layered structure can replace organic growing media such as cocopeat and peatmoss by a simple high-shear granulation process.

AB A high-resolution study of bulk properties in a peat sequence from the Xinjiang Altai Mountains of northwestern China has allowed reconstruction of local variations in peat properties and peat C and N accumulation rates (CAR and NAR) during the Holocene. Analyses of peat bulk density, loss on ignition, and concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) and their elemental ratios and stable isotopic values suggest that changes in peat-forming vegetation types during different parts of this epoch are the major factors responsible for the variations of peat properties in this sequence. The long-term peat CAR has been 25.4 +/- 7.7 (SD) g C/m(2)/yr, with lower values during the early Holocene and higher accumulations during the late Holocene, which is opposite to the Holocene variations in CAR in other northern peatlands. In contrast, the long-term peat NAR is 1.5 +/- 0.5 (SD) g N/m(2)/yr and is higher during the early and middle Holocene and lower during the late Holocene as in other northern peatlands. However, unlike other northern peatlands, long-term peat NAR does not vary with the CAR, which is influenced by the peat density and accumulation rate. Variations in long-term peat C and N accumulations in the Altai Mountains can be attributed to changes in primary productivity, in the dominant plant types and in peat decomposition caused by changes in both regional Holocene climate and local conditions.

AB Composting is considered an environmentally sound and economically viable alternative for the management of organic residues. Although compost product may be used as a peat substitute in soilless culture, it generally has poor physical structure, low nutrient content, high pH, and high salt content. This study chose the coir fiber (CF) produced from coconut (Cocos nucifera) and bamboo vinegar (BV) produced from mottled bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) as the media amendments, and evaluated the effects of CF (at 0%, 15%, and 25%) and/or BV (at 0%, 0.5%, and 1.0%) on the physical, chemical, and microbiological properties of composted green waste (CGW) and on the growth of peacock arrowroot (Calathea makoyana). The highest quality growing medium and the best growth of peacock arrowroot were obtained when CGW was amended with the combination of 15% CF and 0.5% BV; the lowest quality medium and the least plant growth were obtained with nonamended CGW. The optimal combination not only improved particle-size distribution and adjusted bulk density (BD), porosity, and water-holding capacity (WHC) into ideal ranges, but it also decreased pH and electrical conductivity (EC) and increased microbial numbers, enzyme activities, and macro-and micronutrient contents in the CGW. Relative to the nonamended CGW, the optimal CGW reduced the BD from 0.58 g.cm (-3) to 0.34 g.cm (-3) and the pH from 8.05 to 5.61, and increased the total porosity (TPS) from 48.1% to 77.0% and theWHCfrom 57.4% to 75.5%; the optimalCGWincreased shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root fresh weight, root dry weight, plant height, crown breadth, number of leaves, and total root length by 83.9%, 77.8%, 66.1%, 65.1%, 63.6%, 73.8%, 55.6%, and 65.2%, respectively.

AB Peat moss continued to be, though the exploitation of peatlands due to the peat extraction, the most important and used growing substrate in the nursery production of containerized ornamental plants. Biochar, the byproduct of the pyrolysis technology for bio-energy process from organic feedstocks, has been recently demonstrated a promising replacement substitute for peat in ornamentals production. An experiment was carried out in order to evaluate the differences on growth, ornamental quality and nutrients partitioning of two Lavender species (Lavandula angustifolia and L. dentata) grown in a peat-based growing substrate amended with coniferous wood biochar at 0%, 25 %, 50 % or 75 % (by volume). Increasing biochar content of growing substrates resulted in an increase of several chemical and physical properties such as electrical conductivity, pH, bulk density and total porosity and in a decrease of water retention capacity as well as in nutrients availability (P, Ca and Mg). Higher biochar percentages in the substrate negatively affected growth pattern and physiological traits of the potted plants, due to suboptimal conditions of growing substrates. Lavenders grown with 25 % biochar showed similar growing and qualitative response in terms of number of leaves, root length, biomass production and biomass water use efficiency, compared to those cultivated with 0% biochar, due to an enhanced SPAD index, photosynthetic pigments biosynthesis and leaf nutritional status (higher nitrate, P and K). Overall, our experimental data demonstrated that a peat-based substrate amended with 25 % of coniferous wood biochar could be adopted as a sustainable production system for containerized lavenders, with no negative effects on plant growth and ornamental quality.

TI PEATLAND AS AN INDICATOR OF LOADING OF THE ENVIRONMENT WITH ATMOSPHERIC

SO ROSTLINNA VYROBA

DT Article
AB Data on peatland contamination with heavy metals and other risk elements were collected in the contribution.  The research included important peatlands of the regions characterizing various degree of atmospheric immission loading.  The following peatlands were studied:  Borkovicka blata, Zofina Hut, Mrtvy luh, Rokytecka slat, Nova Hurka, Krasno, U Zlatokopecke cesty, Nove Mesto, Grunwald, Nacetin, Na piscinach, Jerabi louka, Pancicske raseliniste, V Eliscine udoli, Panske Pole, Rejviz, Karlovice, Rokytnice, Velke Darko.  Samples were taken from overall profiles of peatlands, including sapropel horizons and mineral parent rock, that is in layers of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 and 50 cm in each layer.  The samples were analyzed for mobile and total contents of As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Li, Mo, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn.  In addition, the analyses were supplemented with another chemical composition, physical properties (to a depth of 1 m), biological activity (0-30, 30-50, 50-100 cm) and chemical analyses of major representatives of plant cover.  This part includes exclusively total contents of the studied elements.
   The results obtained were assessed to the relation of the type of the peatland, geomorphological unit, altitude.  Attention was paid to the limit values (minima and maxima), average values for all bearings, profiles and distribution in the profile.
   The results confirm that the peatlands (especially sphagnum-peat in the original conditions) are excellent indicators of loading of the environment with immissions.  They can be considered as indicators of accumulation of contaminants released to the biosphere.
   Contamination of individual peatlands is of various degrees.  Neither unambiguous relation of the degree of contamination to the type of peatland, nor to altitude (except Pb) was confirmed.  The degree of contamination of peatlands is associated with the region or with its atmospheric immisions.  The lowest values of studied risk elements were recorded in the Sumava Mountains, Trebocska panev and Slavkovsky les (forest).  The highest values were reported from Krusne hory, Jizerske hory (mountains), Krkonose and Jicinska pahorkatina (upland).
   Out of studied contents of risk elements, the immobilizing effect of human acids was recorded in Pb, Zn and Cd.  The content of these elements was reducing conspicuously with the depth of peatland profile.
   The maximum available contents of risk elements in peatland soils and peats were suggested in relation to the reduced bulk density.

AB The majority of European fen grasslands are seminatural and require appropriate management to maintain their high natural value. The research area was located in the middle basin of the Biebrza River Valley, where fen grasslands vegetation was i) grazed by Konik horses, ii) mowed once every 2-4 years, or iii) abandoned for 16 years. The question was as follows: How do different land use types affect the floristic composition and restoration of abandoned fen grasslands? In the examined sites we measured floristic composition and soil physicochemical parameters. The observed changes in the floristic composition resulting from the introduction of the new type of land use were significant and they occurred in a relatively short period of time. With the cessation of mowing for 16 years, the intermittently wet Molinia meadows were replaced by trees and shrubs of alder woodlands (Alnetea glutinosae class), and the plant species diversity significantly decreased. The mowing of the Molinion meadows once every 2-4 years proved to be sufficient to prevent the encroachment of trees, but it was not enough to stop the expansion of Molinia caerulea. In the site grazed with Konik horses for 13 years, the primary fen grassland vegetation (Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae) was replaced by species of low, trampled swards and intermittently wet meadows (Molinio-Arrhenatheretea class). The soils under all of the sites differing in the land use type were classified as Eutric Rheic Hemic Histosols. They were typical peatland soils, slightly acidic to neutral. The results of the soil analyses indicate the high natural states of the studied areas and that their extensive use only slightly affected their physicochemical properties. Greater soil bulk density was noticed under the pasture than under the abandoned and mowed sites, but the extensive grazing of Konik horses caused only a slight increase in volumetric density to 0.19 g cm(-3). Our results show that on both the mowed and the grazed sites, the content of soil organic matter and soil organic carbon was higher than that on the abandoned site. In the mowed part as well as in the grazed part, long-lasting monitoring of the effects of the management strategies used on vegetation and soil properties is still needed. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

AB There have been recent concerns about the anthropogenic phosphorus (P) loading to the naturally oligotrophic Everglades ecosystem. We investigated the effect of P loading on the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (N). We investigated the distribution of the potentially mineralizable N (PMN) rate as an indicator of the influence of P loading on selected microbial activities in soil and detritus layers. Soil characteristics measured included bulk density; total C, N, and P; microbial biomass C; and N and extractable NH4+. PMN rates ranged from 10.4 to 325 mg N kg(-1) d(-1). The highest values of microbial biomass C and N, total P, extractable NH4+, and PMN were observed in the detrital layer, and rates decreased with increasing soil depth. An increase in the size of the microbial pool and heterotrophic activity (organic N mineralization) was found to be related to the P-loading rate and related to the distribution of total P content in the soil and detrital layers, Extractable NH4+ was a good indicator of PMN rates and total P was found to be significantly correlated to microbial biomass C and N. The stimulatory effect of P enrichment on microbial activity, overall size of the microbial biomass pool, and the PMN rate has led to an increased availability of inorganic N, which could potentially affect macrophyte growth and water quality of the northern Everglades system.

AB Peatland carbon and water cycling are tightly coupled, so dynamic modeling of peat accumulation over decades to millennia should account for carbon-water feedbacks. We present initial results from a new simulation model of long-term peat accumulation, evaluated at a wellstudied temperate bog in Ontario, Canada. The Holocene Peat Model (HPM) determines vegetation community composition dynamics and annual net primary productivity based on peat depth (as a proxy for nutrients and acidity) and water table depth. Annual peat (carbon) accumulation is the net balance above-and below-ground productivity and litter/peat decomposition -a function of peat hydrology (controlling depth to and degree of anoxia). Peat bulk density is simulated as a function of degree of humification, and affects the water balance through its influence on both the growth rate of the peat column and on peat hydraulic conductivity and the capacity to shed water. HPM output includes both time series of annual carbon and water fluxes, peat height, and water table depth, as well as a final peat profile that can be "cored" and compared to field observations of peat age and macrofossil composition. A stochastic 8500-yr, annual precipitation time series was constrained by a published Holocene climate reconstruction for southern Qu ' ebec. HPM simulated 5.4m of peat accumulation (310 kg Cm-2) over 8500 years, 6.5% of total NPP over the period. Vascular plant functional types accounted for 65% of total NPP over 8500 years but only 35% of the final (contemporary) peat mass. Simulated age-depth and carbon accumulation profiles were compared to a radiocarbon dated 5.8 m, c. 9000-yr core. The simulated core was younger than observations at most depths, but had a similar overall trajectory; carbon accumulation rates were generally higher in the simulation and were somewhat more variable than observations. HPM results were sensitive to centuryscale anomalies in precipitation, with extended drier periods (precipitation reduced similar to 10%) causing the peat profile to lose carbon (and height), despite relatively small changes in NPP.

AB A cutover bog contaminated with seawater in New Brunswick, Canada remained barren 5 years after peat extraction operations ceased despite the proximity of natural seed sources. The aim of the study was to identify abiotic stresses impeding plant establishment and test transplanting of salt-tolerant wetland plants. The site consisted of long cambered rectangular fields that sloped down (2%) to the drainage ditches on both sides. Across this slope, zones were delineated based on moisture gradient as: Up-areas (drier), Mid-areas (moist) and Low-areas (wet). Juncus balticus was transplanted to these zones in August 2004 whereas Spartina pectinata was reintroduced in June 2005. Plant material was collected from nearby marshes. Survival of J. balticus in August 2005 was poorest at the Low-areas probably because of the early season flooded conditions of that zone. S. pectinata survival in June 2006 was good in all zones having better adaptation to early season waterlogged conditions. Early season waterlogged conditions resulted from a perched water table (May-June) and were alleviated only upon the complete thaw of the frozen peat layer on 8 July. Thereafter, important changes in peat characteristics occurred: lowered water table depths that increased redox potentials, decreased moisture content (theta) that increased dry bulk density (rho), and increased electrical conductivity (EC) that decreased pH. Waterlogged conditions were of greater magnitude and duration at the Low-areas but salinity levels were highest in the Up-areas and Mid-areas. We conclude that local conditions of waterlogging (especially in the Low-areas) and high salinity and low pH (notably in the Up- and Mid-areas) favoured the survival of S. pectinata in all areas and J. balticus in Up- and Mid-areas only.

AB Seedlings are rejected every year in forest nurseries because of insufficient root development and root plug cohesion. Adequate substrate bulk density and aeration properties are of critical importance for root growth and water and nutrient uptake. The quality norms for nursery substrates, based in part on the ratio of coarse to fine particle sizes, have recently been questioned with respect to substrate performance. We conducted experiments in 2008 and 2009 under commercial nursery conditions to determine the effects of substrate physicochemical properties on seedling growth and nutrition. Seedlings were grown in 13 different substrates composed of coarse and fine peat particles (threshold size: 0.5 mm), perlite, and vermiculite, covering a broad range of physical properties with adequate available water and various coarse/fine particle ratios and aeration properties. Substrate properties had significant effects on growth parameters in both years. Seedling growth was affected by water stress in 2008 and low gas diffusivity in 2009. This study emphasizes the importance of management on substrate performance, indicating that short periods of moderate water stress (matric potential lower than -10 kPa) may hinder seedling growth. It also suggests that when irrigated substrates are maintained within the 0 to -5 kPa matric potential range, gas diffusivity should not be lower than 0.003 to 0.005 cm(2) s cm(-2) s(-1), in agreement with the modeled O-2 profiles in root plugs. Hence, when designing and using substrates at the nursery scale, more attention should be paid to aeration properties after potting and to the management rather than to the coarse/fine particle ratio.

AB The interactions between organics and sand particles at different moisture contents are important in understanding the general mechanical behavior of rootzone sand mixtures. Towards this end, eight rootzone sand mixtures (4 shapes x 2 moisture contents) used in golf green construction were tested using the cubical triaxial tester (CTT). These eight mixtures consist of sphagnum peat as the organic source and four sands of varying particle shape (round, subround, subangular, and angular). The sand-peat mixtures were tested at two moisture contents (air-dried and 30 cm tension). Of all the test samples, air-dried round sand with peat had the highest initial bulk density (IBD) value (1.49 g/cc), while moist angular sand with peat had the lowest IBD value (1.23 g/cc). These values influenced the compression behavior of samples, for example, the air-dried round sand with peat was least compressible while moist angular sand with peat was most compressible. Generally, moisture enhanced the compressibility of test specimens. At an isotropic pressure of 100 kPa, the volumetric strain value of moist round sand with peat was 47% higher than the volumetric strain value of the air-dried round sand with peat. Consequently, moisture and peat in bulk sand samples act as lubricants and assist in the compression process. In addition, bulk modulus values decreased with moisture. Due to the dominant effect of peat, there were no large differences between bulk modulus values of different particle shapes. The shear and failure responses of the above-mentioned eight compositions were also analyzed, compared, and modeled. Of all sand mixtures tested, air-dried angular sands with peat had the highest brittle-type failure stress value, 181 kPa at 34.5 kPa confining pressure, and moist subangular sand with peat had the lowest ductile-type failure stress value, 141 kPa at the same confining pressure. Shear modulus values increased with the increase of mean pressure, but in the case of sands containing both moisture and peat, shear modulus values increased gradually. Overall, peat and moisture content have a dominant effect on the compression and failure behavior of the rootzone sands.

AB A 7000 year-long cirque glacier reconstruction from South Georgia, based on detailed analysis of fine-grained sediments deposited downstream in a bog and a lake, suggests continued presence during most of the Holocene. Glacier activity is inferred from various sedimentary properties including magnetic susceptibility (MS), dry bulk density (DBD), loss-on-ignition (LOI) and geochemical elements (XRF), and tallied to a set of terminal moraines. The two independently dated sediment records document concurring events of enhanced glacigenic sediment influx to the bog and lake, whereas the upstream moraines afford the opportunity to calculate past Equilibrium Line Altitudes (ELA) which has varied in the order of 70m altitude. Combined, the records provide new evidence of cirque glacier fluctuations on South Georgia. Based on the onset of peat formation, the study site was deglaciated prior to 9900 +/- 250 years ago when Neumayer tidewater glacier retreated up-fjord. Changes in the lake and bog sediment properties indicate that the cirque glacier was close to its maximum Holocene extent between 7200 +/- 400 and 4800 +/- 200 cal BP, 2700 +/- 150 and 2000 +/- 200 cal BP, 500 +/- 150-300 +/- 100 cal BP, and in the Twentieth century (likely 1930s). The glacier fluctuations are largely in-phase with reconstructed Patagonian glaciers, implying that they respond to centennial climate variability possibly connected to corresponding modulations of the Southern Westerly Winds.

AB Seed potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) are increasingly produced by minitubers originated from tissue culture techniques to eliminate the chance of infections by viruses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of several potting media for minituber production in the greenhouse environment. Six growing media treatments were used in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments included perlite, soil, perlite + vermiculite (1:1 v/v), perlite + peat moss (1:1, v/v), perlite + soil (1:1, v/v), perlite + soil + composted cattle manure (4:3:3 v/v), and perlite + soil + vermicompost (4:3:3v/v). All treatments except treatments that contained composted cattle manure or vermicompost were subjected to daily application of nutrient solution. Growing media were analyzed for a selected number of physical and chemical properties. Tuber yield and yield parameters were determined 75 days after planting. Leaf area, shoots, and root DW and FW and concentrations of N in roots and shoots were measured at tuber bulking stage. The highest value of particle density and bulk density and the lowest value of porosity and EC were obtained for the media that contained Perlite. The greatest value of leaf chlorophyll index throughout the growing period was observed at perlite + soil + composted cattle manure and perlite + soil + vermicompost, likely due to excess availability of N. The maximum contents of N in the shoot root and tubers were observed in perlite + soil + composted cattle manure. Fresh and dry minituber yield and number of minituber per m(2) shoot and root FM and DM yield were greater in growing media without soil than the containing Compound with soil. The fertigated perlite + peat moss (1:1, v/v) resulted in the greatest yield among treatments likely due to desirable EC, pH, and porosity. This treatment can be recommended as a suitable media for the production of potato minitubers in greenhouse environment.

AB Vanadium, Cr, and Ni accumulating in a Swiss peat bog since 12 370 C-14 yr B.P. have been measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after acid dissolution in a microwave autoclave. Strict quality control schemes were applied to guarantee the accuracy of the applied analytical methodology. The concentration gradients in the peat column and comparison with Pb indicate that V, Cr, and Ni are effectively immobile in the ombrotrophic section of the peat profile but that Ni is added to the minerotrophic peat layers by chemical weathering of the underlying sediments. The lowest metal concentrations were found during the Holocene climate optimum (5320-8230 C-14 yr B.P.) when "natural background" values averaged 0.55 +/- 0.13 mug g(-1) V, 0.76 +/- 0.17 mug g(-1) Cr, and 0.46 +/- 0.09 mug g(-1) Ni (n = 18); given the average bulk density (0.05 g/cm(3)) and accumulation rate (0.05 cm/yr) of peat in this zone, the corresponding atmospheric fluxes are approximately 14, 19, and 12 mug m(-2) yr(-1) for V, Cr, and Ni, respectively. The highest concentrations of V, Cr, and Ni were found during the Younger Dryas cold climate event(centered at 10 590 C-14 yr B.P.) when background values were exceeded by about 40 times. Elevated concentrations and accumulation rates were also found at 8230 and 5320 C-14 yr B.P., which are consistent with the elevated dust fluxes recorded by Greenland ice cores. By far the greatest contribution of the three elements to the peat inventory is atmospheric soil dust, and the metal fluxes vary not only with climate change but also landuse history (especially the beginning of forest clearing for agriculture ca. 6 millennia ago). The V/Sc, Cr/Sc, and Ni/Sc ratios were remarkably similar to their corresponding ratios in the earth's crust until the onset of the Industrial Revolution (240 C-14 yr B.P.), which largely validates the use of crustal concentrations for calculating enrichment factors (EF) for these elements. In modern samples, the EFs of V, Cr, and Ni reach maximum values between 2.4 and 4.1, relative to background; anthropogenic emissions are a more likely explanation of the elevated El's than either plant uptake or chemical diagenesis. This study demonstrates the usefulness of peat bogs as archives of atmospheric metal deposition and underpins the potential of peat cores to help distinguish between lithogenic and anthropogenic metal sources.

AB Accelerating sea-level rise poses a threat to mangroves and salt marshes. Sediment accretion on the soil surface and belowground root production is proposed to increase soil elevation enabling these intertidal habitats to maintain their position relative to mean sea level. However, shallow soil subsidence is frequently observed, which may cancel out or even outweigh the positive effects of surface accretion and root production on soil elevation gains. The processes that lead to shallow soil subsidence have not often been investigated. Here, we used computed tomography (CT) imaging to determine the volume of coarse pores in the top 20 cm of 30-cm-deep soil cores collected from mangroves and salt marshes within Moreton Bay, eastern Australia. The four field sites have long-term observations of variation in soil surface elevation gain, surface accretion rate, and shallow subsidence rate using the rod surface elevation table-marker horizon (RSET-MH) method. Over our sites, we found that the rates of shallow soil subsidence were positively related to the volume of soil coarse pores and soil clay and silt content rather than to the volume of fine pores or total porosity or other soil properties. In turn, the volume of soil coarse pores was positively related to the volume of animal burrows and root mass. Fine-pore volume and total porosity of soils were negatively associated with soil bulk density, which was in turn negatively related to soil organic matter content. Our results indicate influences of differently sized soil pores in shallow soil subsidence and suggest that animal burrowing may play a role in shallow soil subsidence.

AB The feasibility of composted (C), composted plus vermicomposted (V1) and straight vermicomposted (V2) tomato crop waste as component of rooting media for Euonymus japonicus 'Microphylla' and Lavandula angustifolia vegetative propagation was studied. Mixes of C, V1 and V2 with coir fibre (CF) at the proportions 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100 (v:v) were assayed. Physical, physico-chemical and nutritional characteristics of all materials and mixes were determined and correlated with cutting rooting and growth performances. The compost and the two vermicomposts were markedly different from CF. They had higher bulk density and lower total porosity than CF. Compost had lower water-holding capacity and shrinkage in response to drying than vermicomposts and CF. Compost and vermicomposts were alkaline materials whilst CF was almost neutral. Electrical conductivity (EC) was low in CF and vermicomposts, and high in compost due to the high mineral contents, mainly of K+, SO42- and Na+ in this material. EC and the ions contributing to it (K+, SO42, Na+) showed highly significative inverse correlations with rooting percentage for the two species and with root and shoot growth but only for E. japonicus. Due to its high EC, compost C (average rooting = 22.5%) performed worse than vermicomposts V1 (av. rooting = 97%) and V2 (av. rooting = 98%) whilst the latter performed similarly to CF control (av. rooting = 100%). Thus vermicomposts appeared to be more appropriate than compost as rooting media constituent.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in forest floors and in mineral and peat forest soils were estimated at the European scale. The assessment was based on measured C concentration, bulk density, coarse fragments and effective soil depth data originating from 4914 plots in 22 EU countries belonging to the UN/ECE ICP Forests 16 x 16 km Level I network. Plots were sampled and analysed according to harmonized methods during the 2nd European Forest Soil Condition Survey. Using continuous carbon density depth functions, we estimated SOC stocks to 30-cm and 1-m depth, and stratified these stocks according to 22 WRB Reference Soil Groups (RSGs) and 8 humus forms to provide European scale benchmark values. Average SOC stocks amounted to 22.1 t C ha(-1) in forest floors, 108 t C ha(-1) in mineral soils and 578 t C ha(-1) in peat soils, to 1 m depth. Relative to 1-m stocks, the vertical SOC distribution confirmed global patterns reported for forest soils: similar to 50% of SOC was stored in the upper 20 cm, and similar to 55-65% in the upper 30 cm of soil. Assuming 163 Mha of European forest cover and by using various scaling up procedures, we estimated total stocks at 3.50-3.94 Gt C in forest floors and 21.4-22.7 Gt C in mineral and peat soils down to 1-m, which is similar to 40% more than commonly published. The most useful predictors and stratifiers for C stocks were humus form and tree species for the forest floor, RSG for mineral soils and parent material for peat soils.
   This dataset will be further explored, predominantly for validation of soil C models, resampling and comparison with legacy and future forest SOC inventories. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrochemical patterns across groundwater-fed wetlands, especially carbonate and redox gradients, can influence phosphorus (P) availability by controlling its distribution among different soil pools. We explored these linkages by comparing shallow (5-20 cm) soil properties along groundwater flowpaths in two rich fens, a marl fen, and a poor fen. Organic matter content, bulk density, and total elemental content varied more with depth to underlying drift materials than with water table fluctuation, but also were influenced by groundwater discharge, which stabilized water table elevations and controlled redox conditions. Total sulfur and calcium content increased where pore-water chemistry indicated active iron and sulfate reduction. Calcium mineral dynamics, however, did not appear to influence P availability: first, calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) accounted for < 2% of the soil composition, except in the marl fen where it accounted for 20-25% of the soil composition. Second, Ca-bound P pools, determined from hydrochloric extraction of wet soil samples, accounted for < 25% of the inorganic soil P pool. In contrast, iron-bound P determined from bicarbonate-buffered dithionite solution, accounted for 50-80% of the inorganic soil P, and increased where there was evidence of groundwater mixing, as did P release rates inferred from incubated anion resin bags. The total carbon and phosphorus content of organic-rich soils as well as available and labile P pools were strongly correlated with pore-water iron and alkalinity concentrations. Groundwater discharge and resulting hydrochemical gradients explained significant variation in soil composition and P availability across each site. Results highlight the importance of conducting biogeochemical studies in the context of a site's shallow geologic setting and suggest mechanisms supporting the diverse plant species unique to groundwater wetlands.

ID WATER-STRESS; AGGREGATE STABILITY
AB Rainfall in the northeastern United States can be erratic, causing fluctuations in the supply and quality of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). To address these problems, yield and quality of potato were studied during three growing seasons to determine their response to soil management treatments designed to increase soil organic matter. The soil management treatments, consisting of rotation crop [oat (Avena sativa L. cv. Porter vs. green manure] and annual soil amendment applications [none vs. 22 t ha(-1) compost and 45 t ha(-1) manure from beef cattle (Ros taurus L.)], were tested in combination with supplemental irrigation treatments (none, reduced, and moderate) on a Caribou gravelly loam (fine-loamy, mired, frigid Typic Haplorthod). The green manure consisted of pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Trapper), oat, and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) seeded at 168, 56, and 34 kg ha(-1), respectively, After a single season, the amendments increased sail organic matter, K, Mg, Ca, cation exchange capacity, and aggregation. Modified-Morgan soil-test P increased and bulk density decreased after two amendment applications. Total yields were significantly increased by the amendment treatment [8.6 t ha(-1) (23%), 1993; 8.1 t ha(-1) (27%), 1994; and 4.0 t ha(-1) (11%) for 1995], and U.S. No. 1 yields were similarly affected. The amendments increased tuber decay incidence during all 3 yr. Irrigation treatments significantly increased total yields by 10 t ha(-1) (36%) in 1994 and 11.6 t ha(-1) (37%) in 1995, while significantly reducing specific gravity and increasing tuber size. Irrigation also increased tuber decay incidence in 2 of 3 yr During the time course and under the conditions of this study, the green manure rotation crop had no significant effect on yields or tuber quality compared with the oat rotation. In contrast, soil amendment and supplemental irrigation proved to be management tools that could rapidly affect productivity in this agricultural system.

AB This study evaluated the use of bottom ash as a root medium component when mixed with coir dust in different ratios. Each of two kinds of bottom ash (coarse bottom ash, CBA, with particle size >= 5 mm; and fine bottom ash, FBA, with particle size >= 5 mm) were mixed with coir dust in the ratios 10:0, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, and 0:10 (coir dust:bottom ash, v/v). We investigated the physical properties of mixed substrates, i.e., particle size distribution, container capacity, air space, total porosity, bulk density, and the moisture retention curve; and chemical properties, i.e., pH, electrical conductivity, and nutrient content. Large particles (1.4-5.6 mm in diameter) increased as the ratio of CBA increased, while small particles (< 710 mu m in diameter) increased as the ratio of coir dust increased. As the ratio of FBA increased, small particles (< 106 mu m) increased. As CBA increased, the container capacity decreased but air spaces increased, while increasing FBA reduced the air spaces in the substrate mix. In 100% FBA medium, the maximum container capacity was low (32.5%), and had very low easily available water (below 2%); this suggests that, on its own, FBA has poor potential for use as a horticultural medium. In substrate mixes of acidic coir dust (pH 4.99) and CBA, increasing the proportion of bottom ash gradually increased the pH, which is similar to perlite. Electrical conductivity of the substrate increased as the ratio of FBA in the substrate mix increased, largely caused by the high Ca and Na content of FBA. When the proportion of FBA was increased in the substrate mix by more than 30%, Cd contents were higher than the acceptable level for use in horticulture. Other heavy metals (As, Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn) were detected at low concentrations in all substrate mixes, but within the acceptable range for use in horticultural media. Based on these results, bottom ash may be used as a component of horticultural media, but to maintain physical and chemical properties within acceptable limits it is not recommended to exceed 20% of the mixture.

AB This research aimed to study the possibility of recovery of waste from the canning industry of palm heart as substrates for vegetables. The fiber of Australian king palm (Archontophoenix alexandrae) was used in natura (FN), collected immediately after the heart extraction, and after the acid hydrolysis process (FH), in the proportions 1:1:1 (v:v:v) leaf, "cartridge" (sheaths) and stipes. Materials in pure form (100% FN and 100% FH) and their mixtures with in natura brown peat, in volume proportions (80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80 and 0:100%), were submitted to physical (moist and dry bulk density, total porosity, air space and available water), and chemical analyses (pH and electric conductivity), in completely randomized design with three repetlications. All results were submitted to variance analysis and, when statistically significant, to regression analysis. Both pure FN and FH presented low dry density, high values for total porosity and air space and low water retention. All mixtures with peat showed density reduction. The addition of FN to peat increased total porosity, air space, and reduced available water. FH added to peat reduced the total porosity and available water, and increased the air space. FN and FH also increased the peat pH value. However, the addition of FN increased the electric conductivity, while the addition of FH decreased it significantly. Considering the availability of palm residues and its excellent characteristics after the acid hydrolysis, this may constitute a basic material for the formulation of substrates.

AB This paper provides information on the impact of recent climate change on carbon sequestration in peatland systems in South West England. This is important because peatlands have the potential to sequester and hold large quantities of ant hropogenically released CO2. This paper investigates whether there has been a reduction in the strength of carbon sinks in a valley mire and blanket bog, which occur on the limits of the biogeographical envelop for peallands in Britain. Past rates of carbon accumulation were calculated from peat depth and the sequential analysis of peat age, bulk density and carbon content from cores taken from valley mire and blanket bog. At the valley mire site contemporary net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was calculated by measuring inputs to the peat body, via net primary productivity (NPP), of Sphagna. Losses of C from the peat body were calculated by measuring CH4, and aquatic carbon, calculated from catchment export of particulate and dissolved organic carbon. The study found similar mean rates of carbon accumulation since 1850 of 11.26 t +/- 0.68 t CO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) (307 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in valley mire and 11.77 t +/- 0.88 t CO(2)e ha(-1)yr(-1) (321 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in blanket bog. The mean present-day CO2 sequestration rate for Sphagna on valley mire was calculated to be 9.13 t +/- 0.98 t CO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1) (249 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Both past and contemporary rates of CO2 sequestration were found to be at the maxima of those reported for temperate peatlands. NPP was found to vary according to microform with higher rates of carbon sequestration found in lawn and hummock microforms compared with pools. Our work suggests that recent changes in the climate appear to have had limited impact on the strength of peatland carbon sinks in South West England. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The bulk density, particle size distribution, and water retention curve of the substrates were determined. Furthermore, the water profiles, oxygen (O-2) concentration, and O-2 diffusion rate of all substrates were determined during a 16-week cultivation period. Plant height, flower production, and both shoot and root dry weights as well as percent growth increase of plants were measured at the end of the experiment. The substrate water profiles showed that the water content was greater and air content was less in substrates of pots irrigated with drip irrigation than with sub-irrigation. The O-2 concentration in all substrates irrespective of the irrigation method was high. The O-2 diffusion rate values of sub-irrigated substrates were greater than those drip-irrigated, and Ps(60):Pb-30:P-10 showed the greatest values. Shoot and root dry weights and percent growth increase of drip-irrigated plants were greater than that of sub-irrigated plants.

AB A major challenge in soil science is to monitor and understand the state and change of soils at a national scale to inform decision making and policy. To address this, there is a need to identify key parameters for soil health and function and determine how they relate to other parameters, including traditional soil surveys. Here we present a national-scale dataset of topsoil sampled as part of a wider agri-environment monitoring scheme in Wales, UK. Over 1,350 topsoils (0-15 cm) were sampled across a very wide range of habitats and a range of physical, chemical and biological soil quality indicators were measured. We show consistent differences in soil physicochemical properties across habitat types, with carbon decreasing and pH increasing across the habitat productivity gradient from bogs through woodlands and grasslands to arable systems. The soils within our dataset are largely within the limits identified as important for supporting habitat function, with the exception of excessive phosphate levels in mesotrophic grassland. Cluster detection methods identified four soil functional classes based on measured topsoil properties, which were more related to habitat type than the genesis-based soil classification from soil maps. These soil functional classes can be interpreted as phenoforms within the soil genoforms found by traditional soil classification. This shows the importance of land-use management in determining the soil health and functional capacity of soils. Our work provides an account of the current state of soil health in Wales, its relationship to soil function and a baseline for future monitoring to track changes against agri-environment and other policy targets.

TI Multi-scale analysis of electrical conductivity of peatlands for the
   assessment of peat properties
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CATION-EXCHANGE CAPACITY; WATER-CONTENT; SOIL
AB Peatlands store large amounts of carbon. This storage function has been reduced through intensive drainage, which leads to the decomposition of peat, resulting in a loss of carbon. Measurements of the real (sigma) and imaginary part (sigma) of electrical conductivity can deliver information on peat properties, such as the pore fluid conductivity (sigma(w)), cation exchange capacity (CEC), bulk density ((b)), water content (WC) and soil organic matter (SOM) content. These properties change with the peat's degree of decomposition (DD). To explore the relationships between the peat properties, sigma, sigma and DD, we focused on three different types of survey and scales. First, point measurements were made with a conductivity probe at various locations over a large area of northeast Germany to determine the degree of correlation between sigma and DD. Second, nine of these locations were selected for sampling to determine which of the properties sigma(w), CEC, (b), WC and SOM predominantly influence sigma and sigma. This multisite dataset includes the entire range of DD and was analysed in the laboratory. Third, one site was selected for a survey of sigma including sampling, to identify which properties mainly control sigma in a single-site approach. Statistical analysis revealed that for the multisite laboratory dataset, sigma(w) has the strongest effect on sigma, followed by CEC, whereas sigma is mainly determined by CEC. In a single-site approach, WC followed by CEC had a dominant effect on sigma. No clear correlation could be observed between (i) DD and peat properties and (ii) DD and sigma or sigma. This is because of the complex changes in properties with increasing DD.

AB Postglacial paleoenvironmental changes and landscape development in the Hudson Bay Lowlands in subarctic Canada were inferred using sediment properties and diatom and pollen assemblages in the sediments of a lake raised above the surrounding peatlands in an ice-marginal landform. Coarse-grained, inorganic sediments at the base of the Lake AT01 core suggest a high-energy periglacial environment, following isostatic emergence from Hudson Bay around 6840 cal. BP. Initial diatom assemblages dominated by Fragilaria spp., and pollen of Shepherdia canadensis, indicate early successional conditions in a recently deglaciated environment. Around 6200 cal. BP, tychoplanktonic Fragilarioid diatoms are replaced by large benthics. Coincident increases in Equisetum spores, Cyperaceae pollen and sediment organic matter suggest the establishment of a more productive macrophyte-rich shallow lake. While the Holocene Thermal Maximum and subsequent Neoglacial may have contributed to these shifts, pollen and diatom records suggest only subtle responses to Holocene climatic changes. A core chronology inferred from radioisotopes suggests a hiatus in sediment accumulation between 3650 and 200 cal. BP. Peaks in carbonate inferred from loss-on-ignition and increases in bulk density in that section of the core suggest some effect of erosional or thermokarst processes, or the breaching of a sandbar, now a remnant island in the lake, in the drainage of the lake and ensuing hiatus. Sediment accumulation resumed within the past two centuries; diatom assemblages in the uppermost section are characterized initially by benthic diatoms of smaller valve size compared with the pre-hiatus assemblages. More recently, increases in the planktonic diatom Cyclotella stelligera are recorded, signaling significant environmental changes.

AB Peat properties including porosity, dry bulk density (DBD), ash content (and their XRD and SEM), TOC, humification and plant macrofossil were measured in the well dated, young peat profiles of Jinchuan Mire in southeast Jilin of China. Base on the properties and depositional rates (Li et al., 2019) of JC1 (50-cm long) and JCA (92-cm long), carbon accumulation rates (RCAs) have been calculated for different periods and processes of peatland development over the past 1000 years have been described. The long term variations of the RCAs between Jinchuan Mire and nearby Baijianghe Mire (Xia et al., 2019) during the past 1000 years matched reasonably well, reflecting similar carbon accumulation rates under the same climatic control even though the plant species could be very different in the two mires. Enhanced detrital content caused by surface runoff due to heavy rains with decline of wood% in plant remains probably reflect wet climates; and vice versa. In comparisons with regional climatic records, we describe the development of Jinchuan Mire as follow: (1) relatively warm and wet climates between 1000 CE and 1150 CE reflected by dominant herb species (> 95%) with low wood% and no Sphagnum%, low DBD and detritus, and high TOC% and porosity. A dry climate occurred during 1150-1200 CE to lower the water table and enable growth of mosses in the mire. (2) Wet and cooling conditions during 1200-1370 CE supported well development of Sphagnum mosses and good development of the mire. (3) A climatic change from wet/cool to cold/dry between 1370 CE and 1440 CE caused disappear of Sphagnum mosses. (4) During the Little Ice Age (1440-1850 CE), cold and dry conditions led to poor peat development without Sphagnum mosses. (5) After 1850 CE, warm and wet conditions were in favor of aquatic herb growth. (6) Human impact caused anomaly peat accumulation with mainly tree species and detritus between 1950 and 1965. The peatland has been recovered from natural condition and development of Sphagnum mosses since 1965. Estimated RCAs in the hummock site and the lawn site are 320 gC/m(2)/y and 63 gC/m(2)/y, respectively during 1970-2010. Estimation of carbon accumulation over the entire peatland needs more work.

AB Peat-mineral soil mix (PMM) over tailings sand (TS) or overburden (OB) is a commonly used prescription for oil sands reclamation. The TS and OB (the substrates) often have unfavorable conditions such as high salinity, soil compaction, low nutrient availability in OB, and low nutrient and water availabilities in TS, which may limit tree growth. The objective of this study was to identify limiting factors for growth of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) on PMM over TS and white spruce (Picea glauca) on PMM over OB in the Athabasca oil sands region, Alberta, Canada. In the pine sites, mean annual growth of height (HG), diameter at breast height (DBHG) and aboveground biomass (ABG) were significantly correlated with volumetric water content (VWC) in PMM and foliar delta C-13 in current-year needles. Sites with high productivities had the lowest foliar delta C-13 relative to sites with low and medium productivities. The VWC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) together explained 80% of the variation in both the current annual increment of height (HI) (p = 0.007) and aboveground biomass (ABI) (p = 0.008). In the spruce sites, foliar potassium (K) and foliar and soil nitrogen (N) concentrations were positively correlated with HG, DBHG and ABG, consistent with patterns in K and inorganic N (the sum of NH4+-N and NO3-N) concentrations in PMM in those sites. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) and bulk density (Db) were greater in low than in medium and high productivity sites. The Db and inorganic N concentration together explained 67% of the variation in HI (p = 0.037), while Db and EC together explained 79% of the variation in ABI (p = 0.009). In conclusion, lodgepole pine trees planted on PMM over TS sites were limited by low water availability, while low soil N availability and high salinity limited the growth of white spruce trees planted on PMM over OB sites. Reclamation practices need to addresswater and nutrient limitations to ensure the success of reclaiming disturbed areas in the oil sands region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil denitrification activity can be highly variable due to the effects of varied land use management practices within catchments on the biogeochemical regulators of denitrification. To test this assumption in the context of mixed-use rural catchments, it was hypothesised that the relative magnitude of denitrification activity may be regulated, among others, by a gradient of soil nitrate (low to high) between organic (peat bog, heathland, and acid grassland), forest (coniferous and deciduous), and grassland (improved and semi-improved) rural land use types. The denitrification potential (DP) of organic, forest and grassland soils, in two UK catchments was measured in the laboratory. Land use type significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the DP, which ranged between 0.02 and 63.3 mg N m(-2) h(-1). The averaged DP of organic and forest soils (1.08 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) was 3 and 10 times less than the DP of semi-improved (4.06 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) and improved (12.09 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) grassland soils, respectively; and among others, nitrate correlated positively (p < 0.05) with the DP. The results indicated that the difference in soil nitrate concentration between organic (naturally low in nitrate availability) and grassland soils (nitrate enriched due to land management) partially regulated the extent of DP. In the absence of N fertilisation, except for the atmospheric N deposition, the relatively low net nitrification potential (as a source of nitrate for denitrifiers) of organic and forest soils alone seem to have resulted in lower denitrifier's activity compared to grassland soils. Moreover, the interactions between soil organic carbon, pH, bulk density, water filled pore space, and texture, as these are influenced by the relative degree of land management, exerted additional controls on the DP. The results suggest that land management can have significant effects on denitrification, and thus needs to be considered when modelling and/or predicting the response of denitrification to land use change.

AB Sandy soils, with low productivity, could be improved by compost application to sustain crop production. This study aimed to examine the effect of three compost types (vegetable, fruit and yard waste compost, garden waste compost, and spent mushroom compost) on basic properties of a loamy sand and greenhouse tomato productivity. Disturbed and intact soil samples were taken from a decade-long compost field experiment on loamy sand with three compost types at application rate of 30 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) (7.5 ton ha(-1) yr(-1)). The soils were characterized for chemical and physical properties. Tomato was planted in a greenhouse using soil samples from the field and vegetative and yield parameters (plant height, stem diameter, leaf number, and fruit yield), water productivity, and harvest index were evaluated. All compost types significantly increased soil total carbon, total nitrogen, pH, electrical conductivity and significantly decreased bulk density, with no effect on plant available water compared to the control. Fresh and dry fruit weights were significantly increased after compost addition. Plant height, leaf number, stem diameter, and total biomass did not significantly improve after compost addition. Spent mushroom compost had greater effect in improving tomato productivity. A decade-long application of composts on loamy sand improved basic chemical and physical properties which were reflected in increased fruit yield in tomato. Since no negative effect of compost was observed, we suggest that sandy soils may serve as a safe end use option for these composts and potentially support crop growth.

AB Organic amendments such as peat moss and various composts are typically added to sand-based root zones to increase water and nutrient retention. However, these attributes are typically lost within a few years as these amendments decompose. Biochar is a high carbon, porous coproduct produced from the pyrolysis of phytobiomass. Its unique porosity gives it excellent water and nutrient retention properties. Additionally, unlike other organic amendments, biochar is extremely resistant to microbial decomposition. Pure calcareous sand (control) or mixtures of three different biochars and sand at 1, 5 and 10% volume biochar/total volume were tested. Bulk densities decreased while percent pore space increased with the addition of all three biochars at all of the addition rates. Water retention was greater than the control in all but one of the biochar treatments, and several of the biochar mixtures had values for compaction resistance similar to pure sand. Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L. 'Pure Distinction') plant heights, root lengths, and fresh and dry weights were evaluated in mixtures grown hydroponically in polyvinyl chloride tubes (112 mm outside diameter x 99 mm inside diameter) filled 30 cm deep with 1 cm diameter pea gravel, over which 30 cm of either pure sand or sand/biochar mixtures were added to mimic a United States Golf Association root zone. Five weeks after seeding, plants grown in several of the biochar mixtures had significantly greater fresh and dry weights, shoot heights and root lengths than the control. Based on these results it appears that the addition of certain biochars would improve water retention and increase overall plant growth in sand-based root zones. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Relationships between soil C and N stocks and soil formation, climate, and vegetation were investigated in a gridded database connected to the National Forest Inventory in Norway. For mineral soil orders, C and N stocks were estimated to be 11.1-19.3 kg C.m(-2) and 0.41-0.78 kg N.m(-2), respectively, declining in the following order: Gleysols > Podzols > Brunisols > Regosols. Organic peat-type soils stored, on average, 31.3 kg C.m(-2) and 1.10 kg N.m(-2), whereas shallow Organic folisols stored, on average, 10.2 kg C.m(-2) and 0.34 kg N.m(-2). For Norway's 120 000 km(2) of forest, the total of soil C stocks was estimated to be 1.83 Gt C, with a 95% CI of 1.71-1.95 Gt C. Podzolic soils comprise the largest soil group and store approximately 50% of the forest soil C. Sixty percent of the soil C stock in Podzolic soils was stored in the mineral soil, increasing with temperature and precipitation. Poorly drained soil types store approximately 47% of the total forest soil C in Norway. Soils with water saturation have large C stocks mainly in the forest floor, suggesting that they are more susceptible to forest management and environmental change. Soil C stocks under pine and spruce forests were similar, although pine forests had larger C stocks in the forest floor, while spruce forests had the highest C stocks in the mineral soil compartment. C stocks in the forest floor increase from dry to moist ground vegetation, while ground vegetation nutrient classes reflect better the C and N stocks in the mineral soil.

AB Organic soils are an excellent substrate for commercial lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) farming; however, drainage accelerates oxidation of the surface layer and reduces the water holding capacity, which is often lethal for crops that are sensitive to water stress. In this case study, we analyzed 942 peat samples from a large cultivated peatland complex (18.7 km(2)) in southern Quebec, Canada, and demonstrated from spatial and temporal patterns that agriculture resulted in a compacted layer below the root zone. We grouped the samples based on the year in which the corresponding fields were created on the previously undisturbed peatland (cutoff years 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000) and discovered that bulk density has continued to increase, partly due to the overburden pressure, while organic matter has continued to decline since the fields were reclaimed and drained in phases between 1955 and 2006. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) in the upper 20 cm was remarkably lower on fields older than 10 yr (p = 0.0973 for Wilcoxon rank test), with more samples having a Ks < 2.0 x 10(-3) yr. Soil water available capacity (SWAC) was between approximately 5 and 33 cm on fields reclaimed after 2000, while samples from fields reclaimed before 2000 had a lower SWAC between 2 and 23 cm (groups discernable at p = 0.0203). It is possible, however, that the greatest rate of change in Ks and SWAC occurred within even a year of reclamation. The results of this study call for active measures to reduce organic soil degradation such as reducing tillage and on-field traffic or following a crop rotation scheme.

ID HEAT-PULSE METHOD; PROBE
AB The thermal conductivity of soil under a given set of conditions is most important as it relates to a soil's microclimate. The early growth and development of a crop may be determined to a large extent by microclimate. The effect of bulk density, moisture content, salt concentration, and organic matter on the thermal conductivity of some sieved and repacked Jordanian soils was investigated through laboratory studies. These laboratory experiments used the single probe method to determine thermal conductivity. The soils used were classified as sand, sandy loam, loam, and clay loam. The two salts used were NaCl and CaCl2, while addition of peat moss was used to increase the organic matter content. For the soils studied, thermal conductivity increased with increasing soil density and moisture content. Thermal conductivity ranged from 0.58 to 1.94 for sand, from 0.19 to 1.12 for sandy loam, from 0.29 to 0.76 for loam, and from 0.36 to 0.69 W/m K for clay loam at densities from 1.23 to 1.59 g cm(-3) and water contents from 1.4 to 21.2%. The results also show that an increase in the amount of added salts at given moisture content (volumetric solution contents theta ranged from 0.03-0.12 m(3) m(-3) for the sand and from 0.09-0.30 m(3) m(-3) for the clay loam) decreased thermal conductivity. Increasing the percentage of soil organic matter decreased thermal conductivity. Finally, it was found that the sand had higher values of thermal conductivity than the clay loam for the same salt type and concentrations.

AB Loess-dominated ecosystems cover almost-equal-to 14% (11 000 km2) of the Arctic Coastal Plain and much of the northern portion of the Arctic Foothills. Knowledge of this poorly known ecosystem is important for sound land-use planning of the expanding developments in the region and for understanding the paleoecological dynamics of eolian systems that once dominated much of northern Alaska. A conceptual alkaline-tundra toposequence includes eight common vegetation types and associated soils that occur near the arctic coast. A model of the regional loess gradient describes soils and vegetation downwind of the Sagavanirktok River. The addition of calcareous loess affects numerous soil properties, including bulk density, pH, water retention properties, concentrations of soil nutrients, and seasonal thaw depths. Many plant taxa, particularly cryptogams, increase in abundance downwind of the river, apparently in response to higher amounts of nutrients and moisture associated with finer soil-particle sizes and greater organic content. For example, the highest extractable P values (8-12-mu-g/g) occur in areas with circumneutral pH and finer grained soils, and low P values (< 2-mu-g/g) occur in acidic soils north of the loess region. Early, minerotrophic stages of tundra succession are maintained by loess blown from the Sagavanirktok, Canning, and other large braided-river floodplains. Areas downwind of these rivers provide analogues for vegetation that existed in unstable areas of the Alaskan Coastal Plain during and following full glacial conditions. Total aboveground phytomass in wet acidic sites at Prudhoe Bay (163 +/- 21 g/m2) is close to values from similar sites at Barrow and Devon Island. Only a small amount of data is available for alkaline areas, but there is indication of lower biomass near the major rivers, suggesting a response to lower nutrient regimes. Properties of loess tundra important for land-use planning include: (1) its high ice content, which contributes to its susceptibility to thermokarst; (2) high salinities, which hamper revegetation efforts; and (3) presence of certain plant species such as Dryas intergrifolia, which are particularly sensitive to disturbance. The loess gradient provides a natural analogue for road dust, an extensive disturbance associated with oil-field development.

AB Purpose An experiment was designed to introduce a substitute for peat, which is used in the production of bedding for the cultivation of ornamental plants and is imported and expensive. For this reason, the usability of peanut shells and Azolla, whose accumulation in the environment causes environmental problems, is a major research question.
   Methods In this work, Dieffenbachia amoena was grown in a growing medium that had substituted peanut shells and Azolla mixes composts (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 100 v/v %) for peat. The controls received only peat: perlite (2:1 v/v) without composts.
   Results It was found that, as the substitution of compost increased, nutrients also increased in the growing medium. Nonetheless, the nutrients led to minor changes in the leaves. As compost increased, the bulk density of the growing media decreased (0.17, 0.16, 0.15, and 0.15 g cm(-3)). The range of substrate physical properties, such as container capacity, airfilled porosity, and total porosity, was within the recommended range. The 15-100% substitution of compost increased the electrical conductivity and pH of the growing media. The 30% compost treatment led to significant differences in the final height (32.06 cm), trunk diameter (11.66 mm), stem and leaf fresh weight (57.52 g), and stem and leaf dry weight (5.10 g) in comparison with the controls.
   Conclusions Considering the high price of peat in comparison with compost, replacing peat with 30% compost is economically preferable. Compost was thus found to be a good alternative to peat as an ornamental plants growing medium.

AB Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were determined by a static chamber technique at eight drained swamp peatland sites, with crop and forest covers. Over a 6-month period (May - October, 1991), CH4 fluxes ranged from -5 to 7 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 and were not correlated with either soil temperature or water table position. Integrated seasonal emissions were -0.40 to 0.04 g CH4 m2 over 147 days; the sites with a forest or grass cover were a small sink of CH4 whereas the sites with horticultural crops showed no significant flux. Laboratory incubations showed that the highest CH4 consumption rates (3 to 9 mug CH4 g-1 d-1) occurred in the least disturbed soils. The results, when compared with CH4 fluxes from nearby swamps which have been unaffected by drainage, suggest that drainage of temperate peatlands has reduced emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere by 0. 6 - 1 x 10(12) g CH4 yr-1. CO2 fluxes ranged f rom 0 to 16 g CO2 m-2 d-1 and were correlated with the seasonal pattern of temperature in the upper part of the soil profile. Integrated seasonal fluxes for the sites in which root respiration was an unimportant contribution were 0.6 - 0.8 kg CO2 m-2 over 181 days. Aerobic laboratory incubations revealed CO2 production rates of 0.2 - 1.4 mg CO2 g-1 d-1, an average of 5 times the rate under anaerobic conditions. Using bulk density and loss-on-ignition data, we found that the seasonal CO2 fluxes translate into surface lowering of the peat of about 2 mm yr-1, whereas the commonly observed lowering in these cultivated peatlands is 20 mm yr-1. These data suggest that processes other than direct oxidation, such as shrinkage and aeolian erosion, are the major contributor to the surface lowering of the peat.

AB Composted pig manure (CPM), unmixed or in mixture with perlite, was evaluated as growing medium based on both physical characteristics and agronomic performance. The physical properties were determined in CPM, perlite (0.5-2.5 mm), and their 75:25, 50:50 and 25:75 mixtures by volume. It was found that unmixed CPM has a higher bulk density (BD) than perlite, a slightly lower air space at a suction of 10 cm, and a markedly higher content in easily available water (EAW), although the water content at a suction of 10 cm is the same in the two media. Mixing CPM with perlite by 50:50 seems to increase the actual water content and decrease the actual air content at container capacity, while the BD and the EAW score intermediate to those in the unmixed constituents. Simulation of the relative hydraulic conductivity (K-r) indicates a sharp decrease in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) of CPM, perlite and their mixtures as the media suction increases. The differences in the decrease rate of K-r between the tested substrates are rather small, with the most and least steep decrease being observed in perlite and the mixture by 50:50, respectively. The agronomic performance of CPM was assessed by growing greenhouse cucumber in bags filled with perlite up to 20 cm in height, CPM up to 10 or 20 cm in height, and their mixture by 50:50 up to the same heights as CPM. A media height of 10 cm in the bag resulted in appreciably higher yields than a height of 20 cm, regardless of the type of the substrate, while the latter had no significant effect on yield. This effect of media height was ascribed to the steep decrease in K, which was minimized in all media at higher suction levels than 10 cm, thereby severely restricting water availability in their upper layers (10-20 cm) when their height in the bag was 20 cm.

AB We examined rates of C, N, and P mineralization in soils from 16 northern Minnesota wetlands that occur across an ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient. Soils were incubated at 30 degrees C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 59 wk, and the results were fit with a two-pool kinetic model. Additionally, 39 different soil quality variables were used in a principal components analysis (PCA) to predict mineralization rates.
   Mineralization of C, N, and P differed significantly among wetland types, aeration status (aerobic vs. anaerobic), and their interaction term. Despite low total soil N and P, there was a rapid turnover of the nutrient pools in ombrotrophic sites, particularly under aerobic conditions. On a volumetric basis, C and N mineralization increased in a predictable manner across the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient, largely due to increasing soil bulk density. However, P mineralization per cubic centimeter remained relatively high in the bogs. The higher total P content of more minerotrophic soils appears to be offset by greater P immobilization due to geochemical sorption, yielding overall lower availability.
   Total C turnover rates were relatively similar among sites, despite large differences in soil quality. We suggest that, over time, the decay rates of organic matter in different wetland communities converge to a common rate. In contrast, CH(4) production was extremely low in ombrotrophic pests.
   The apparent labile pools of N (N(0)), P (P(0)), and C (C(0)) were generally <10% of their respective total pool sizes, except for P(0) in the bogs, which constituted up to 33% of total soil P. From 10% to 87% of the N, P, and C mineralized after 59 wk was derived from their respective labile pools.
   A simple group of variables describing the physical degree of decomposition of organic matter was often as good as, or superior to, more complicated chemical analyses in predicting C, N, and P mineralization. Because pears are classified and mapped according to these variables, it should make scaling efforts in landscape analyses much more tractable.
   Large differences in mineralization rates in northern wetland communities demonstrate that climate change models should not consider these areas as homogeneous entities. Our C mineralization results suggest that soil respiratory response to climate change (as CO(2) and CH(4)) will vary considerably in different wetland communities. Our results also suggest that the common perception that more ombrotrophic sites are inherently more nutrient deficient needs to be reassessed.

AB Organic soil accretion and nutrient accumulation were measured in the northern, central, and southern Everglades to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic nutrient and hydroperiod alterations on organic C and nutrient storage during the past century. Six soil cores (euic, hyperthermic Typic Medisaprists) were collected from nutrient-enriched (Water Conservation Area [WCA] 2A) and unenriched locations. Soil depth increments were analyzed for radionuclides (Cs-137, Pb-210, C-14) bulk density, and nutrients (C, N, P, S) to estimate recent (30-yr) and long-term (100-yr) organic soil accretion and nutrient accumulation. Since WCA 2A was completely impounded in the early 1960s, organic soil accretion in northern WCA 2A (5.8-6.7 mm yr(-1)) increased by three to five times compared with before 1960 (1.9 mm yr(-1)) or with unenriched areas within and outside of WCA 2A (1.4-1.6 mm yr(-1)). Nutrient accumulation in the enriched area of WCA 2A since 1960 was two (184-223 g C m(-2) yr(-1), 13.6-16.6 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) to eight (0.40-0.46 g P m-2 yr(-1)) times higher than before 1960 (110 g C m(-2) yr(-1), 6.6 g N m(-2) yr(-1), 0.06 g P m(-2) yr(-1)) or in unenriched areas (65-90 g C m(-2) yr(-1), 4.7-6.4 g N m(-2) yr(-1), 0 06 g P m(-2) yr(-1)). Unenriched areas of the Everglades possess some of the lowest rates of P accumulation of peatlands in North America. Successful restoration of the Everglades will have to include the elimination of anthropogenic nutrient loadings to limit the P enrichment zone from expanding into existing unenriched interior areas and areas downstream of WCA 2A.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biochar from fast pyrolysis of pine wood mixed with manure compost or vermicompost as a potential container substrate to replace peat moss. Seven biochar substrates were compared to the control (a commercial substrate; 0B) in container cultivation of bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.): 100% biochar (100B), 90% biochar+10% manure compost (90B10C; by volume), 80% biochar+20% manure compost (80B20C), 70% biochar+30% manure compost (70B30C), 90% biochar+10% vermicompost (90B10V), 80% biochar+20% vermicompost (80B20V), and 70% biochar+30% vermicompost (70B30V). The physical characteristics of the container substrate (total porosity, container capacity, air space, and bulk density) were tested using NCSU porometers. The electrical conductivity (EC) and pH of container substrate leachates were measured according to the pour-through method on 34, 41, 62, and 83days after planting (DAP). Growth index was measured on 34, 41, 48, 55, 62, 69, 76, and 83 DAP. Leaf SPAD value, net photosynthesis rate, total leaf area, and stem diameter were measured at week 11. Dry weight and yield were measured at the flowering (72 DAP) and harvesting (113 DAP) stages. The control showed the highest container capacity (59.2%) and the lowest air space (14.1%), with the opposite results observed on 100B. Control had pH values within 6.0-7.0 for optimum pepper growth, while container substrates with biochar resulted in a pH less than 6.0 from 41 to 83 DAP. EC in control at 34 DAP was approximately four times greater than values observed on the other substrates. EC of 70B30V slightly increased between 34 and 41 DAP, and the lowest EC was observed on 100B. SPAD value and net photosynthesis rate were the greatest on plants grown in control. The total leaf area, stem diameter, growth index, vegetative (stem+leaf) and flower dry weights, and yield were the highest in control, followed by 70B30V, 80B20V, and 90B10V, with the lowest in 100B.

AB A liquid dairy cattle slurry was composted using rice hulls as absorbing matrix and bulking agent. The main results obtained were as follows: 1) The structure and size of the rice hulls as well as their absorption capacity, enables to obtain a good composting mixture (moisture: 714.2 g kg(-1); C/N ratio: 28.80; bulk density: 0.429 Mg m(-3)). 2) Compost stability was reached after 58 d of composting, with the following characteristic: (on a dry matter basis), volatile solids 730.0 g kg(-1), C/N 18.36, TKN 19.8 g kg(-1), K 18.4 g kg(-1), P 11.3 g kg(-1), humified carbon 46.0 g kg(-1), respirometric index 0.88 mg O-2 g(-1) VS h(-1), dry matter yield 573.4 g kg(-1), organic matter yield 500.5 g kg(-1), water losses 569.9 g kg(-1) and airflow-rate (m(3) kg(-1) d.m. d(-1)): maximum 2.96, minimum 0.28, mean 0.75. 3) The curing phase was determined when a high degree of compost maturity was reached. After 254 d of composting the data obtained (on a dry matter basis) were as follow: volatile solids 658.9 g kg(-1), C/N 13.52, TKN 25.1 g kg(-1), K 20.0 g kg(-1), P 12.7 g kg(-1), humified carbon 108.1 g kg(-1), dry matter yield 463.6 g kg(-1), organic matter yield 369.1 g kg(-1), and water losses 639.9 g kg(-1). 4) The kinetic approach showed that the active composting phase could be represented by a first order reaction. High reaction rate constant (k=0.0281 d(-1)) due mainly to cellulose and hemicellulose degradation was determined. 5) The compost data obtained suggest that two marketable products could be developed: the first after 56 d of composting, could be utilized for field application and the second after 254 d could be used as a substitute for organic substrate (e.g., peat) in greenhouses and for sensitive plants.

DE Cymbidium; growth media; nutrition; flowering
AB A trial was conducted to study the influence of the media and frequency of nutrient application on growth and flowering of Cymbidium hybrid 'H.C. Aurora'. Treatments involved growing of Cymbidium in different combination of media, i.e., M-1- perlite + coco peat + brick pieces; coco peat + brick pieces + leaf mould; perlite + brick pieces; M-4- thermocol + coco peat + brick pieces; M-5- rotten log + sand + coconut husk + brick pieces; M-6- Castanopsis hysterix bark + maize cob + leaf mould; M-7- leaf mould + sand + coconut husk + brick pieces + charcoal (Farmer's practice) and spraying of water soluble fertilizer (N19P19K19) at 1 g/I concentration at weekly and biweekly interval. The result indicated that among the vegetative characters, maximum number of shoots (6.11), number of pseudobulb (4.40), pseudobulb girth (3.03 cm), length leaf (37.95 cm), and floral characters like spike length (66.51 cm) and number of spike/m(2) (15.04) were recorded at growing media Castanopsis hysterix bark + maize cob + leaf mould. Further frequency of water soluble fertilizer significantly influenced growth and flowering of Cymbidium. Maximum number of shoots (4.54), spike length (54.59 cm) and number of flowers/ spike (10.19) were recorded with biweekly spraying of water soluble fertilizer (1 g/l). Further, the growing media significantly influenced the NPK content of leaves. The physical properties, i.e., pH (6.25), EC (0.23 mmhos/cm(2)), bulk density (0.52 g/cc) and water holding (49%) of Castanopsis hysterix bark + maize cob + leaf mould medium was found to be better for growth and flowering of Cymbidium orchid.

AB A process-based model was developed and validated to predict the regional dynamics of the water table (WT) in peatlands under climatic forcing. The model detailed the water-energy feedbacks in the common SVAT (soil-vegetation-atmosphere transportation) model and specified the differences in processes in pristine fens, pristine bogs and drained peatlands. The spatiotemporal changes in the WT of the peatlands throughout Finland were computed based on 10 km x 10 km grids for the period 2000-2099. The calculations used country-scale data on vegetation, catchment topography and profiles of peat bulk density and water content in the three mire types. Furthermore, the ACCLIM climate scenarios representing the current climate and the changing climate were used to identify the climatic impacts on the WT throughout Finland.
   Sensitivity analysis showed that the WT drawdown in pristine fens was most sensitive to increases in temperature and/or decreases in precipitation, whereas the WT drawdown in drained peatlands was the most resistant to such changes. For all three mire types, a 10% increase in precipitation based on the current climate tended to offset the effect of a 2 degrees C warming on WT drawdown and a 20% increase in precipitation tended to offset the WT drawdown caused by a 6 degrees C warming. Based on the ACCLIM climate scenario, the model showed moderate changes in the annual values of the WT, which ranged from +0.2 +/- 1.5 to -4.3 +/- 0.93 cm. The changes were most noticeable during the period 2060-2099. The drawdown was more pronounced in late spring than in summer and autumn. Additionally, the WT drawdown was most significant in the western parts of the northern aapa-mire region, where the peatlands were mostly pristine, and the increase of precipitation was more limited than in other parts of the country. These results show that the pronounced spatiality and temporality in the WT changes should be considered in studies addressing how climate change will affect mire ecosystems in terms of C balance and GHG emissions.

AB The mobility of nutrients in soils is well characterized, whereas little information is available for common horticultural substrates based on peat. Aim of the current study was to investigate the mobility and dynamics of phosphorus (P) as well as the parameters involved in P transport to plant roots in peat-based substrates. A series of experiments was run to determine the impedance factor (f) and the buffer power (b). The impedance factor was determined for black peat and black peat mixed with 20% and 40% (v/v) of mineral component at volumetric water content (theta) of 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% and at different diffusion time. Buffer power was calculated for black peat and black peat mixed with 20% (v/v) of seven different mineral components. Phosphorus was applied at rates of 0, 35, and 100 mg (L substrate(-1)), respectively. The impedance factor was not affected by addition of the mineral component to peat. However, f increased from 0.03 to 0.2, by increasing theta from 40% to 60%, indicating that water content has a significant effect on this parameter. Substrate-solution P ranged from 0.3 to 27 and from 1 to 95 mg P (L solution)(-1) for the P-application rate of 35 and 100 mg P (L substrate)(-1), respectively. Buffer power of the substrates ranged from 1 to 17.25 depending on the mineral component, and it was positively correlated with oxalate-soluble Fe and Al in the substrate. The calculated effective diffusion coefficient for P in the substrate was in the range of 10(-7) to 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1). This high value could be attributed mostly to the low buffer power rather than to the high impedance factor.

TI FACTORS CONTROLLING PEAT COMPACTION IN ALLUVIAL FLOODPLAINS: A CASE

AB Subsidence due to peat compaction may have important implications in alluvial floodplains, because it leads to wetland loss, land inundation, and damage to buildings and infrastructure. Furthermore, it potentially influences spatial and temporal river sedimentation patterns, and hence the evolution of alluvial floodplains. As the vast majority of peatlands occur in cold temperate regions, alluvial plains situated in such areas are most susceptible to these implications. To determine which locations within alluvial floodplains are most vulnerable to high amounts of compaction-induced subsidence, it is necessary to quantify compaction and to identify which factors influence the amount and rate of peat compaction. For this, we carried out field work in the Cumberland Marshes (east-central Saskatchewan, Canada) guided by the following two questions: (1) how much peat compaction has occurred over the past decades to centuries, and (2) which factors control the amount and rate of peat compaction at the same timescale. To address these questions, we used methods involving construction of stratigraphic cross sections, organic-matter content and bulk-density measurements, and radiocarbon dating. A new sampling device was devised to sample uncompacted peat in the field. Results show that peat layers have compacted up to 43%, within a few centuries, with compaction rates of up to 6.08 mm/yr. The dominant factors influencing peat compaction are: (1) organic-matter content, (2) stress imposed on a peat layer, and, to a lesser extent, (3) plant species composition. In an alluvial setting, crevasse splays and natural levees are sites that are most susceptible to high amounts of peat compaction at short timescales (10(0)-10(2) years). Sheet-like splay deposits initially compact underlying peat uniformly, whereas differential compaction commonly occurs beneath natural levees due to lateral variations in sediment thickness. Subsidence due to peat compaction creates additional accommodation space and hence locally enhances floodplain sedimentation rates.

DE RECLAMATION OF FELLED-OUT PEATLANDS; CHANGES IN MICROCLIMATE AND SOIL
   MEDIUM
AB The peatland of Borkovicka blata in the Tabor district is a suitable model study site. There are natural reserves, natural therapeutic source, areas after devastation bark deep harvesting, after surface milling cutting, areas cultivated into meadows, forests and reclaimed after harvesting into meadows, forests and arable land. There are also pyrite fen bogs, areas excessively cut and those with properly finished cutting and preserved peatland character. This is an area of occurrence of quality artesian water with spring flowings and artificial wells. During eight years at this site the effect of the use of felled areas reclaimed into forest, for grasslands and arable land on the changes in some meteorological indicators, hydrosphere, physics, chemistry and soil microbiology. The reserve and derelict land served as a comparative area after exploitation of peat. This contribution gives summaries of some results (except monitoring atmosphere). The results show the disturbance of temperature conditions (of air and soil) on areas after industrial exploitation of peat. Maximum and minimum values show an extension of temperature amplitude compared with original situation. Diurnal and nocturnal temperature amplitude extended. From practical standpoint the reduction in minimum ground air temperatures on felled areas in spring and autumn months is significant. In April reduction is 2.55 degrees C, in May 1.66 degrees C, in September 1.62 degrees C and in October 2.40 degrees C. Soil porosity was most stable in the reserve, followed by area after lodging, forest, meadow and arable land. In the reserve maximum capillary water capacity (MKVK) under reduction in minimum water capacity (MVK). On reclaimed areas porosity decreased due to the effect of MKVK and MVK (the most markedly on the arable land). An increase in the reduced value of bulk density weight corresponds to the development of porosity on reclaimed areas where the ash percentage increased as well. The value of soil reaction did not show any significant changes. On arable land C-ox and C-h values decreased, the highest C-f was found in the reserve. The highest quantity of N-t and N-NH4 was in the reserve, the most N-NO3 was on reclaimed areas. P2O5 and K2O contents increased on reclaimed areas, the most and to the greatest depth in arable land. Raised K2O content reaches greater depths (GO cm) compared with P2O5 (30 cm). Vegetation cover, fertilization and intensive management supported the development of biological activity of soil. Decomposition of cellulose increased also basal respiration. Potential respiration shows a lack of easy-available organic substances (increase after alcohol adding). Physiological groups of microarganisms were evaluated as well. Generally speaking, initial values of biological activity of natural peatland sites are low, reclamation activities and they increase by utilization with time. The greatest stability of sire conditions on forest reclamation was manifested in reclaimed areas. Significant changes in arable land take place during reclamation.

AB Growth performance of container-grown dogwood (Cornus alba L. 'Sibirica'), forsythia (Forsythia x intermedia Zab 'Lynwood'), ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius L.), and weigela (Weigela florida (Bunge) A. DC. 'Variegata Nana') were evaluated in 20 waste-derived substrates classified into five groups. Each group had 0, 20, 40 or 60% (by volume) of paper mill biosolids in binary mixtures with bark (PB group), tertiary mixtures with topsoil and sand (PTS group), and quaternary mixtures with bark, topsoil and sand (PBTS group). There were also similar binary and quaternary mixtures with compost instead of bark (PC and PCTS groups, respectively). With few exceptions, top dry weights of all four species increased (linear or curvilinear responses) with increasing rate of biosolids, and were higher in the compost-amended PC and PCTS (forsythia, 72-99 g/plant, range over all rates of biosolids; ninebark, 97-116; dogwood, 45-60; and weigela, 18-25) than in bark-amended PB and PBTS (forsythia, 26-71; ninebark, 32-80; dogwood, 33-56; and weigela, 7.7-18) substrates. Top dry weights in a control nursery mix (80:15:5 by vol bark:peat:topsoil) used by nurseries were: forsythia, 70; ninebark, 110; dogwood, 51; and weigela, 48. While none of the weigela plants attained size comparable to that of the control, top dry weights of other species reached or exceeded their control counterparts in PC and PCTS substrates over most or all rates of biosolids (all species); in PB and PBTS with 40-60% of biosolids (forsythia and dogwood); and in PTS with the highest rate of biosolids(forsythia, 91; and ninebark, 140). Higher retention of nutrients in the substrates and/or more favorable bulk densities and air-filled porosities, primarily due to the biosolids, contributed to increased growth and/or foliar nutrient status of the plants.

AB We have analyzed an almost 14,000 year old peat sequence on the island of Isla de los Estados (55 degrees S. 64 degrees W), east of Tierra del Fuego, in the core of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies. A multitude of methods have been used: high resolution C-14 dating; detailed lithologic descriptions including humification degree; loss on ignition; magnetic susceptibility; bulk density; pollen and spore analysis and determination of Aeolian sand influx. By combining proxies for wind and precipitation we have been able to reconstruct how the westerlies have varied over time in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. It shows that this westerly wind belt was most intense at the onset of the record, 13,600-13,200 cal BP, coinciding with the mid to late part of the Antarctic Cold Reversal, followed by a gradual decline. At 12,200 cal BP the westerlies seem to have shifted to a position south of Tierra del Fuego and this phase, the calmest and driest period on the island throughout the sequence, ended at 10,000 cal BP when the westerlies moved equatorward again. Since then the westerlies have been present but with a variable impact on the 55 degrees S latitude of the Atlantic. Mostly conditions have been fairly similar to today, but occasionally with a wider or narrower and/or weaker or stronger wind belt. At 7200 cal BP wind intensity began to increase and between 4500 and 3500 cal BP these southern latitudes experienced a distinct wind and precipitation maximum, both in terms of perseverance and intensity. Our results show a both wide and strong wind belt, with possible niveo-aeolian activity in Tierra del Fuego in winter, and possibly creating milder summers around the Antarctic Peninsula. In the later part of the Holocene, expansion contraction phases of the wind belt, especially in winter, seem to have been a common phenomenon. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Peat is the most common substrate used in nurseries despite being a very expensive and a non-renewable material. Peat replacement with biochar could be a sound environmental practice, as it is produced from waste biomass, but evaluation of biochar as a potting substrate is needed. Ratios of peat:biochar of 100:0, 70:30, 30:70 (BC0, BC30, and BC70, respectively), two fertilizer rates (FERT1, FERT2), and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation were tested on potted Pelargonium plants. Plant growth, flowering, bio-physiological and nutritional responses, and root mycorrhization were evaluated. The BC30 mixture did not affect plant growth compared with pure peat. However, BC30 in combination with FERT2 treatment was more effective in enhancing nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll (CHL) leaf concentrations, and leaf and flower numbers. The BC70 mixture depressed plant growth, flowering traits, and root mycorrhization. Leaf N concentration was below the sufficiency range reported for Pelargonium growth. Leaf concentration of phosphorous (P) was adequate in pure peat and in BC30 but it dropped close to sub-optimal values in BC70. The pH value of the mixtures lowered P availability, though in BC30 the mycorrhizal activity could have allowed adequate P plant uptake. In BC70 plants, the deficiency of both N and P might be a reason for the observed growth reduction. The inoculation of the substrate with selected AMF improved plant growth (higher dry biomass, greater floral clusters, larger and more abundant leaves) and quality resulting in unstressed (lower electrolyte leakage and higher relative water content values) and greener leaves (low L* and C*, high CHL content) and in more intensely colored flowers. We conclude that biochar can be applied in nursery/potted plant production provided that the proportion in the peat mixture does not exceed 30%. Furthermore, AMF inoculation contributed to achieving the best plant performance in 30% biochar amended medium.

AB Dry bulk density (BD) and concentrations of N and C in the organic matter have been studied in the top layers (0-40 cm) of Sphagnum-dominated hummocks on ombrotrophic bogs selected to form three gradients from hyperoceanic to weakly oceanic conditions in areas of different latitude in NW Europe and North America. In such hummocks N is conserved during the decay process and can, therefore, be used as an innate marker to calculate mass balances and the rate of the decay process and also to establish an approximate time scale.
   The variation in BD and N by depth in the living moss layer is explained by the growth pattern of the mosses, and the litter formed at the bottom of the layer (the litter depositon level, LDL) becomes depleted in N. Further down in the litter and peat layers the variation in BD and N is explained by the decomposition and the subsequent losses of C and disintergration of the matrix of the organic matter in the acrotelm.
   Below the LDL the concentration of N increases with depth down to the decay decrease level (DDL) as does BD down to the compaction decline level (CDL), a few cm below the DDL. In both cases the increase can be described by an exponential function of the cumulative amount of N and cumulative weigth of organic matter, respectively. The increase in BD dependes more on the matrix of organic matter losing resistance than on the load of the overlying peat. The DDL is regarded as the limit between the two functional layers, which are the acrotelm and catotelm. Below the DDL and CDL, the irregular variation in N and BD indicates that the processes of decay and compression have become interrupted at various stages.
   The annual transfer of organic matter to the litter layer at the LDL is about ten times greater on the bogs in the hyperoceanic, temperate regions, than in the sub-arctic region. However, the depth of the DDL and amount of organic matter contained above it does not correlate with the degree of oceanity. The age of the organic matter at DDL (range 40->400 yr) is less in the hyperoceanic areas than in the less oceanic areas at the same latitude. However, higher decay rates on the bogs in the hyperoceanic areas offset the higher transfer of organic matter at the LDL. As a result, the final accumulation of slowly decaying organic material in the catotelm does not correlate with the degree of oceanity but might, instead, depend more on the hydrology of the bog.

AB Tidal marsh degradation has been attributed to a number of different causes, but few studies have examined multiple potential factors at the same sites. Differentiating the diverse drivers of marsh loss is critical to prescribing successful interventions for conservation and restoration of this important habitat. We evaluated two hypotheses for vegetation loss at two marshes in Long Island Sound (LIS): (1) marsh submergence, caused by an imbalance between sea-level rise and marsh accretion, and (2) defoliation associated with herbivory by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum. At our western LIS site, we found no evidence of herbivory: crabs were scarce, and crab-exclusion cages provided no benefit. We attribute degradation at that site to submergence, a conclusion supported by topographic and hydrologic data showing that loss of vegetation occurred only in wetter parts of the marsh. In contrast, at our central LIS site, our observations were consistent with herbivory as a driving force: There were substantial populations of Sesarma, crab-exclusion cages allowed plants to thrive, and vegetation loss took place across a variety of elevations. We also analyzed soil conditions at both sites, in order to determine the signatures of different degradation processes and assess the potential for restoration. At the submergence site, unvegetated soils exhibited high bulk density, low organic content, and low soil strength, posing significant biogeochemical challenges to re-colonization by vegetation. At the herbivory site, unvegetated soils had a characteristic "riddled-peat" appearance, resulting from expansion and erosion of Sesarma burrow networks. The high redox potential and organic content of those soils suggested that revegetation at the herbivory site would be likely if Sesarma populations could be controlled before erosion leads to elevation loss.

AB Increased nutrient loading to the northern Everglades from the nearby Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) has raised concerns of eutrophication of this oligotrophic wetland. A field study was conducted to determine the influence of nutrient loading on spatial distribution of P, N, C, and related physico-chemical parameters in the peat soils (Histosols) of Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A) in the northern Everglades. Field sampling of the top 30 cm of soil was performed at 74 sites across WCA-2A. Isarithmic plots of N and P forms based on geostatistical analyses revealed widespread enrichment of P, especially in areas proximal to surface inflows importing nutrient-laden water from the EAA. Enrichment of less magnitude was shown for soil N, while spatial variability of C, bulk density, ash content, and pH were minimal. Concentration of soil porewater NH4+-N was typically in the 1.5 to 2.5 mg L-1 range in the interior (less impacted) region of WCA-2A, compared with 4 to 8 mg N L-1 near surface inflows at the northern end of WCA-2A. In contrast, soluble reactive P in the Porewater varied from almost-equal-to 100 mug L-1 or less in the interior marsh to >1000 mug L-1 near inflow structures. Mean soil total P at a depth of 0 to 10 cm was 473 mg kg-1 in the interior marsh, compared with 1338 mg kg-1 in the areas adjacent to inflows. Results of this study show that WCA-2A soil has served as a net storage for the increased load of P in nutrient-laden surface inflows. Much of the additional soil P is available for plant uptake, based on the magnitude of P enrichment across a large area. Nutrient enrichment in the soil corresponded with the occurrence of cattails (Typha domingensis Pers. and T. latifolia L.) in areas previously dominated by sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz).

DE Salt marsh; Accretion; Sea-level rise
AB The Great Marsh in northern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire is the largest salt marsh in New England and includes the marsh surrounding Plum Island Sound, one of the most studied coastal wetlands in the United States. A primary goal in marsh research today is predicting their resilience in a regime of sea-level rise, which has become increasingly based on modeling studies with sparse or site-specific field data input. Here, we present the results of a vertical accretion study using Pb-210 and Cs-137 geochronology developed from 50-cm long auger cores taken at 15 locations throughout the PIS marsh. Two significant outliers were omitted from the final analyses due to their unusual depositional settings. The Cs-137 spike produced the shortest-term record and lowest average accretion rate (2.5 mm/yr). Of the various Pb-210 accretion models (Constant Flux-Constant Sedimentation: CF-CS, Constant Rate of Supply: CRS, Constant Initial Concentration: CIC), we chose the CF-CS model accretion rate for comparison to other environmental parameters and future marsh projections due to the robust R-2 linear regression values and its wide use. The 13 stations exhibited an average accretion rate of 3.13 mm/yr, which is 0.6 mm/yr greater than the average rate reported elsewhere in New England. Individual accretion rates show no correlation with geography, elevation, bulk density, loss on ignition, distance to tidal channels, or peat thickness, indicating the complexity of the interacting factors that control marsh growth. Using moderate sea-level rise predictions, we show that large portions of the high marsh are likely to be converted to low marsh by 2050, and that the entire marsh high platform will become low marsh prior to 2070. This is the first time that wide spread field data are used to project a major transformation of the Plum Island Sound platform marsh that undoubtedly will lead to dramatic changes to marsh drainage, backbarrier hypsometry, tidal current dominance, and redistribution of sediment reservoirs, that will include the fronting barrier islands.

AB Biochar addition to soil not only sequesters carbon for the long-term but enhances agricultural productivity. Several well-known benefits arise from biochar amendment, including constant provision of nutrients, increased soil moisture retention, decreased soil bulk density, and sometimes the induction of systemic resistance against foliar and soil borne plant pathogens. However, no research has investigated the potential of biochar to increase resistance against herbivory. The white-backed plant hopper (WBPH) (Sogatella furcifera Horva A th) is a serious agricultural pest that targets rice (Oryza sativa L.), a staple crop that feeds half of the world's human population. Therefore, we investigated the (1) optimization of biochar amendment levels for two rice varieties ('Cheongcheong' and 'Nagdong') and (2) subsequent effects of different biochar amendments on resistance and susceptibility of these two varieties to WBPH infestation. Initial screening results for the optimization level revealed that the application of biochar 10% (w/w) to the rooting media significantly improved plant physiological characteristics of both rice varieties. However, levels of biochar amendment, mainly 1, 2, 3, and 20%, resulted in negative effects on plant growth characteristics. Cheongcheong and Nagdong rice plants grown with the optimum biochar level showed contrasting reactions to WBPH infestation. Specifically, biochar application significantly increased plant growth characteristics of Nagdong when exposed to WBPH infestation and significantly decreased these characteristics in Cheongcheong. The amount of WBPH-induced damage to plants was significantly lower and higher in Nagdong and Cheongcheong, respectively, compared to that in the controls. Higher levels of jasmonic acid caused by the biochar priming effect could have accumulated in response to WBPH infestation, resulting in a maladaptive response to stress, negatively affecting growth and resistance to WBPH in Cheongcheong. This study highlights the importance of investigating the effects of biochar on different rice varieties before application on a commercial scale to avoid potential crop losses.

AB Northern peatlands are a globally significant carbon (C) reservoir, yet also function as dynamic methane (CH4) sources to the atmosphere. The fate of peatland C stores and related climate system feedbacks remain uncertain under scenarios of a changing climate and enhanced anthropogenic pressure. Here, we present a synthesis of Holocene peatland C dynamics for the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada, in relation to the past atmospheric CH4 trends, glacial isostatic adjustment, and paleoclimate. We report that peatland age and trophic status, together with paleoclimate, contribute to explaining some of the temporal variation in C accumulation rates (CARs) in the HBL. Our results show that younger, minerotrophic peatlands accumulate C faster, and although detailed paleoclimate data are not available, the results suggest the possibility of higher CARs in association with warmer Holocene climates. Peat initiation rates and CARs were greatest during the mid-Holocene; however, our results reveal that two-thirds of the HBL C pool is stored in peat of late Holocene age, owing to long-term peatland expansion and development. Whereas the HBL has been a net C sink since mid-Holocene peat initiation, the HBL also appears to have been a modest C source, with 85% of the losses occurring during the late Holocene as a consequence of the gradual decay of previously accrued peat. Late Holocene peat decay, under wetter climatic conditions, and from a landscape occupied by an abundance of minerotrophic peatlands, indicates that the HBL may have been a natural terrestrial source of CH4 to the late Holocene atmosphere. While the peatlands of the HBL may continue to function as a globally significant C store, ongoing C losses from the HBL may have important implications for the global C budget and climate system.

AB Hydraulic thresholds for erosion of fourteen upland mineral and organic soils were determined in a hydraulic flume. These soils are from areas to be afforested in the United Kingdom. Some of the group are erosion resistant but others are susceptible to erosion once denuded of vegetation; for example, by preafforestation ploughing. These threshold data were required to calibrate a hydraulic model for effective design of preafforestation drainage networks on a variety of soils. However, simple field measures of soil properties indicative of erosion potential would be of value to the forestry industry for management purposes. Consequently, hydraulic threshold data were related by linear regression methods to basic soil properties, including organic content, grain size, bulk density, compression strength and penetration resistance.
   The investigation concluded that four peat soils are not eroded by clear water velocities up to 5.7 m s(-1), although a mineral bedload might induce erosion at lesser current speeds. Penetration resistance is a good field indicator of the degree of humification of the peat soils. Although selected physical parameters contribute resistance to water erosion, an increased organic content is pre-eminent in reducing erosion susceptibility in both organic and mineral soils. Although compressive strength was not indicative of soil erodibility, field measurements of penetration resistance on a variety of soils could be related to hydraulic thresholds of erosion; albeit through the construction of discriminant functions interpolated by eye. Consequently, organic content (laboratory) or penetration resistance (field) might form the basis of classifying upland soils in terms of erodibility.
   Mineral soils differ widely in terms of their erodibility, so that subject to further consideration, the use of ploughing for forestry cultivation might be appropriate in wider circumstances than presently recommended by the Forests and Water Guidelines. Ploughing should be acceptable on deep peat providing the underlying mineral soil is not exposed in the bottom of the furrow, and furrows are not led from mineral soils on to deep peat.

AB Arthrobacter ureafaciens K10, with multiple functions, such as feather degradation, phosphate solubilization, and IAA formation, and Streptomyces sp. CP3, with pitaya cladode-degrading ability, were co-inoculated in compost composed of pitaya-pruning waste (PPW), spent mushroom waste (SMW), and duck feathers (DF) in order to produce a compost called Sapf-M. Another compost, called Sapf, was manufactured via the same composting procedure but without inoculation. The two compost products were slightly acidic and had a bulk density less than 0.25 g cm(-3), a water-holding capacity (WHC) greater than 85%, a C : N ratio of nearly 10, and a germination index higher than 85%. Higher IAA concentration, EC, phosphate-solubilizing bacterial numbers, actinobacterial numbers, and water-soluble nutrients, such as ammonium, magnesium, copper, manganese, and iron, were found in Sapf-M compared to Sapf. Five different culture media were prepared: peat mixed with Sapf at a 2 : 1 volume ratio (P-Sapf), peat mixed with Sapf-M at a 2 : 1 volume ratio (P-Sapf-M), Sapf, Sapf-M, and peat. Each of these was analyzed for its ability to produce cherry tomatoes without fertilization. Higher WHC and water-soluble ammonium were found in P-Sapf-M than in P-Sapf. Cherry tomato cultured in P-Sapf-M showed the highest fruit number and yielded 1.04 kg per plant. Fruit firmness, splitting rate, BER incidence, TSS/acidity, and nutrition were all analyzed. After eradication, the mineral concentrations of roots and culture media were also determined. The results of this study show that the bio-inoculated Sapf-M had longer-lasting fertility and greater plant growth-promoting abilities than the Sapf when used as the growing medium for cherry tomato production without further fertilization.

AB The fruticose lichens Cladina stellaris and Cladina rangiferina, form thick mats that can cover large areas of northern peatlands (above c. 50 degrees latitude), including the extensive peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) in Canada, where lichens may cover up to 50% of the landscape. Despite the abundance of lichens in northern peatlands, our understanding of their role within peatland ecosystems, and peat accumulation in particular, is limited. We investigate the potential effect of these mat-forming lichens on peat production and decomposition processes, using field data from an ombrogenous bog in the HBL and laboratory analyses. We hypothesize that (a) production in lichen-shrub hummocks is less than in Sphagnum-shrub hummocks; (b) the decay of lichen litter is faster than that of Sphagnum moss, so the mass litter input to the peat profile is reduced; and (c) faster decomposition of the underlying peat is stimulated by lichen leachates, resulting in greater mass loss. We found that thick lichen mats alter vegetation composition in peatlands, reducing Sphagnum cover and inhibiting the growth of small shrubs. Coupled with low lichen productivity that is constrained by moisture conditions, production for lichen-shrub hummocks is significantly smaller than for Sphagnum-shrub hummocks, confirming hypothesis (a). Our data also support hypothesis (b), with chemical analyses of lichen mats and leachates from lichen mats indicating faster decay of lichens compared to Sphagnum moss, and therefore reduced mass litter input to the peat profile in lichen-dominated hummocks. Although we found no evidence to suggest leachates from lichens enhance decomposition processes in peatlands (hypothesis c), larger dry bulk densities for peat under lichen mats indicate a loss of structural integrity and potential collapse of the peat column.Synthesis. As production of new material added to the peat column is less in lichen-dominated hummocks, local peat accumulation slows or ceases, representing a potential temporary limit to peat growth. Our results highlight the importance of lichens as a vegetation feedback in peatland development, with thick mats probably constraining or reducing hummock height relative to adjacent, lichen-free hollows.

AB Peatlands are an important component of the Holocene global carbon (C) cycle and the rate of C sequestration and storage is driven by the balance between net primary productivity and decay. A number of studies now suggest that climate is a key driver of peatland C accumulation at large spatial scales and over long timescales, with warmer conditions associated with higher rates of C accumulation. However, other factors are also likely to play a significant role in determining local carbon accumulation rates and these may modify past, present and future peatland carbon sequestration. Here, we test the importance of climate as a driver of C accumulation, compared with hydrological change, fire, nitrogen content and vegetation type, from records of C accumulation at three sites in northeastern North America, across the N-S climate gradient of raised bog distribution. Radiocarbon age models, bulk density values and %C measurements from each site are used to construct C accumulation histories commencing between 11,200 and 8000 cal. years BP. The relationship between C accumulation and environmental variables (past water table depth, fire, peat forming vegetation and nitrogen content) is assessed with linear and multivariate regression analyses. Differences in long-term rates of carbon accumulation between sites support the contention that a warmer climate with longer growing seasons results in faster rates of long-term carbon accumulation. However, mid-late Holocene accumulation rates show divergent trends, decreasing in the north but rising in the south. We hypothesise that sites close to the moisture threshold for raised bog distribution increased their growth rate in response to a cooler climate with lower evapotranspiration in the late Holocene, but net primary productivity declined over the same period in northern areas causing a decrease in C accumulation. There was no clear relationship between C accumulation and hydrological change, vegetation, nitrogen content or fire, but early successional stages of peatland growth had faster rates of C accumulation even though temperatures were probably lower at the time. We conclude that climate is the most important driver of peatland accumulation rates over millennial timescales, but that successional vegetation change is a significant additional influence. Whilst the majority of northern peatlands are likely to increase C accumulation rates under future warmer climates, those at the southern limit of distribution may show reduced rates. However, early succession peatlands that develop under future warming at the northern limits of peatland distribution are likely to have high rates of C accumulation and will compensate for some of the losses elsewhere.

AB Assessing carbon sink-source relationships in peatlands must be based on the understanding of processes responsible for long-term carbon accumulation patterns. In contrast with ombrogeneous bogs, however, the processes in geogeneous fens are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution Holocene peat accumulation and macrofossil data from a rich fen (Upper Pinto Fen (UPF)) in west-central Alberta, Canada. The similar to8000-year chronology of a 397 cm peat core was controlled by 20 accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dates. The paludified peatland initially consisted of diverse brown moss species and some Larix trees but was dominated by Scorpidium scorpioides from 6500 to 1300 calibrated years BR The last 1300 years are characterized by the reappearance of Larix together with abundant woody materials and Cyperaccae, culminating in a sharp increase in Tomenthypnum nitens in the last several decades. During the Scorpidium-dominated period, the peat accumulation pattern derived from 15 14 C dates and 260 bulk density measurements indicates declining mass accumulation rates over time (i.e., convex age-depth curve), in contrast with the standard bog growth model (i.e., concave curve). The analysis of the UPF data using an extended model incorporating variable peat addition rates (PAR) to the catotelm suggests a unidirectional sevenfold decrease in PAR from 191.8 to 26.0 g dry mass.m(-2).year(-1) during the similar to5000-year "convex period". Decreasing vegetation production and (or) increasing acrotelm decomposition could have produced the convex pattern. Decreasing PAR might be owing to autogenically induced changes in local hydrology and nutrient availability, which are pronounced in the moisture-limited climate of the region and in peatlands that have a strong groundwater influence. The convex-pattern model, explicit to the height-induced long-term drying hypothesis, has important implications for building simulation models and for projecting future carbon dynamics of peatlands. Prior to recent human disturbance, the UPF site has a time-weighted mean carbon accumulation rate of 31.1 g C.m(-2).year(-1), ranging from 7.2 to 182.5 g C.m(-2).year(-1) during the last 8000 years. This large variation results from the gradual decline of long-term accumulation and short-term climate-induced accumulation "pulses". The results imply that in the absence of climatic change, peatlands with a convex accumulation pattern will reach their growth limit sooner and that their carbon sequestration capacity will decline faster than would be expected given the concave-pattern model.

ID CONTAINER; PERLITE; MEDIA
AB Ground fresh rice (Oryza sativa) hull materials were produced by grinding whole fresh rice hulls and passing the resulting product through a 1-, 2-, 4- or 6-mm-diameter screen to produce a total of four ground rice products (RH1, RH2, RH4, and RH6, respectively). The physical properties and water release characteristics of sphagnum peatmoss (peat) and the four ground rice hull products were evaluated. All of the ground rice hull products had a higher bulk density (Bd) than peat, and as the grind size of the rice hull particle decreased, Bd increased. Peat had a higher total pore space (TPS) than all of the ground rice hull products except for RH6. As grind size decreased, the TPS decreased. Peat had a lower air-filled pore space (AFP) than all of the ground rice hull products and as the grind size of the rice hull products decreased, AFP decreased. Peat had a higher water holding capacity (WHC) than all of the ground rice hull products. Grind sizes RH4 and RH6 had similar WHC, whereas RH1 and RH2 had a higher WHC than RH4 and RH6. Peat, RH4, and RH6 had similar available water content (AVW), whereas RH2 had higher AVW than these materials and RH I had the highest AVW. However, peat had the lowest AVW and easily available water (EAW) as a percentage of the WHC. The ground rice hull products RH1 and RH2 had the highest AVW and EAW of the components tested. Peat had the highest water content at container capacity. As pressure was increased from 1 to 5 kPa, peat released water more slowly than any of the ground rice hull products. The RH1 and RH2 ground hull products released water at a significantly higher rate than peat, but RH4 and RH6 released the most water over these pressures. For all rice hull products, most water was released between I and 2 kPa pressure. The rice hull products RH1 and RH2 had physical properties that were within recommended ranges and were most similar to those of peat.

AB This study evaluated the potential for using cowpeat, a composted dairy manure, as a component of container substrates for foliage plant propagation. Using a commercial formulation (20% perlite and 20% vermiculite with 60% Canadian or Florida peat based on volume) as controls, peat was replaced by cowpeat at 10% increments up to 60%, which resulted in a total of 14 substrates. Physical and chemical properties such as air space, bulk density, container capacity, total porosity, pH, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and cation exchange capacity of the cowpeat-substituted substrates were largely similar to those of the respective control. However, the electrical conductivity (EC) increased with the increased volume of cowpeat. The 14 substrates were used for rooting single-node cuttings of golden pothos (Epipremnum aurcum) and heartleaf philodendron (Philodendron scandens ssp. oxycardium) and three-node cuttings of 'Florida Spire' fig (Ficus benjamina) and germinating seeds of sprenger asparagus (Asparagus densiflorus) in a shaded greenhouse. All cuttings rooted in the 14 substrates, and the resultant shoot and root dry weights of golden pothos and 'Florida Spire' fig 2 months after rooting did not significantly vary across seven Canadian peat- or Florida peat-based substrates. Shoot dry weights of heartleaf philodendron were also similar across substrates, but the root dry weight produced in the Canadian peat-based control substrate was much greater than that produced in the substrate containing 60% cowpeat. Root dry weight and root length produced in the Florida peat-based control substrate were also significantly greater than those produced in substrates substituted by 60% cowpeat. These results may indicate that cuttings of golden pothos and 'Florida Spire' fig are more tolerant of higher EC than those of heartleaf philodendron, as the substrate with 60% cowpeat had EC >= 4.16 dS.m(-1). Seed germination rates of sprenger asparagus from cowpeat-substituted Canadian peat-based substrates were greater than or comparable to those of the control substrate. Seed germination rates were similar across the seven Florida peat-based substrates. The root-to-shoot ratios of seedlings germinated from both control substrates were significantly greater than those germinated from substrates substituted by cowpeat. This difference could be partially explained by the higher nutrient content in cowpeat-substituted substrates where shoot growth was favored over root growth. Propagation is a critical stage in commercial production of containerized plants. The success in using up to 60% cowpeat in rooting and seed germination substrates may suggest that cowpeat could be an alternative to peat for foliage plant propagation.

AB Research was conducted to evaluate cotton gin trash compost (CGC) as a peat substitute in the growth medium of compact potted chrysanthemum, and its possible interaction with the plant growth retardant butanedioic acid mono-(2,2- dimethylhydrazide) (daminozide) applied to control plant size. Rooted terminal cuttings of Dendranthema grandiflora Tzvelev. var. Yoko Ono were potted in an 1 peat: 1 perlite (by volume) medium or in an 1 CGC: 1 peat: 2 perlite (by volume) medium and their foliage was sprayed three times with an aqueous solution of 0, 2000, 2500, 3000 or 3500 mg l(-1) daminozide. The replacement of half of the peat amount in the growth medium with CGC had a restrictive effect on shoot elongation, retarding mainly the internodal length, effect similar to that induced by daminozide. Plants grown in the CGC medium and not treated with daminozide had similar shoot lengths as plants in the peat-perlite medium sprayed with 2000 or 2500 mg l(-1) daminozide. The combination of CGC with the lowest daminozide concentration used (2000 mg l(-1)) induced shoot growth retardation similar to that induced by the highest concentrations (3000-3500 mg l(-1)) of daminozide in the peat-perlite medium. Leaf size was reduced by CGC as by the higher doses of daminozide, while flower head size was not affected. Both, daminozide and CGC, induced an acceleration of flowering, but the final flower head number was not affected. CGC decreased shoot, flower head and peduncle dry weights and increased root dry weight. At planting day, CGC medium had higher pH, EC, bulk density and total solids and lower total porosity and EAW (easily available water) compared to peat-perlite medium; it also held less water in saturation and drained faster. At the end of the experiment the two media had similar pH and EC values. Substitution of 50% peat with CGC in the commonly used medium for potted chrysanthemum commercial cultivation resulted in a reduction of at least 33% of the dose of daminozide necessary to meet the needs of the market for compact plants, with multiple economic and environmental benefits.

TI Ground bovine bone as a perlite alternative in horticultural substrates

DE growing media; soil; air-filled pore space
AB Two grades of ground bovine bone were evaluated as potential alternatives to perlite in horticultural substrates. The bulk density of small and large bone-amended substrates was significantly higher than equivalent perlite-amended substrates. Large and small bone increased the air-filled pore space of sphagnum peat. However, at 10% and 20% (v/v), neither size of bone resulted in as high an air-filled pore space as equivalent amounts of perlite. At 30% and 40%, incorporation of small bone resulted in a similar air-filled pore space as incorporation of equivalent amounts of perlite, and incorporation of large bone resulted in a higher air-filled pore space than incorporation of equivalent amounts of perlite. Water-filled pore space and water-holding capacities of substrates were inversely related to air-filled pore space. When placed in a moist substrate, mineral elements within the bone were able to leach into the substrate over time. Substrates amended with 40% large and small bone had significantly higher concentrations of ammonium (NH4+), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), and chloride (Cl-) than the 40% perlite-containing substrates. Substrates amended with 40% large bone had similar concentrations of magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), iron (Fe), and copper (Cu) while substrates amended with 40% small bone had higher levels of these elements than perlite-amended substrates. Substrate concentrations of nitrate (NO3-) manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and boron (B) were not different among the substrates after 4 weeks in the greenhouse. The pH, electrical onductivity (EC) and NH4+ levels of bone-amended substrates increased to levels significantly higher than recommended and resulted in rapid mortality of 'Orbit Cardinal' geranium (Pelargonium x hortorum), 'Cooler Blush' vinca (Catharanthus roseus), and 'Dazzler Rose Star' impatiens (Impatiens walleriana) plants grown in bone-amended substrates. Therefore, ground bovine bone was not a feasible alternative to perlite for use in horticultural substrates.

AB Estimations of peatland carbon stocks often use generalised values for peat thickness and carbon content. Ground penetrating radar (GPR), a rapid technique for field data collection, has been increasingly demonstrated as an appropriate method of mapping peat thickness. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data as a method for understanding peatland surface elevation are also becoming more widely available. Reliable mapping and quantification of site-specific carbon stocks (e.g. upland raised bogs) is therefore, becoming increasingly feasible, providing a valuable contribution to regional, national and potentially global carbon stock assessments. This is particularly important because raised bogs, such as those found in South Wales are considerable carbon stores. They are, however, susceptible to climate warming owing to their southerly location within the UK. Accurate estimates of peatland carbon stocks has broader importance because world-wide peatland carbon stores are significant and threatened by climate change, posing a substantial challenge not only due to climate feedbacks if this stored carbon is released into the atmosphere, but also the impact on the other ecosystem services that they provide.
   Here, we assess the value of an integrated GPR, LiDAR and Geographic Information System (GIS) approach to improve estimation of regional carbon stocks. We apply the approach to three ombrotrophic raised bogs in South Wales, UK, selected for their conservation value and their topographically-confined raised bog form.
   GPR and LiDAR are found to be well suited, respectively, to mapping peat thickness at bog scale and surface elevation, thus allowing surface and basal topographies to be evaluated using GIS. In turn, this allows peat volumes to be estimated. For the first time, we record values between 55,200 m(3) and 163,000 m(3) for the sites considered here.
   The greater confidence in these peat volume estimates results from the ability to calibrate the GPR velocity using a depth-to-target calibration with peat cores extracted at locations encompassing the deepest bog area. Peat thickness is mapped at the bog scale with near centimetre precision, improving the robustness of subsequent volume calculations and our understanding of the contribution of these small but numerous sites to regional carbon stocks. Our evaluation shows that GPR corresponds well with conventional manual probing but is minimally invasive and therefore less disturbing of sensitive peatland sites, while also offering improved coverage and spatial resolution with less time and cost.
   In combination with measured bulk density and organic carbon contents, these peat volumes allow carbon stocks to be estimated with greater confidence compared to conventional aproaches, having values between 2181 +/- 122 tonnes carbon and 6305 +/- 351 tonnes carbon at our three sites.

AB Pristine peatlands have generally low nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions but drainage and management practices enhance the microbial processes and associated N2O emissions. It is assumed that leaving peat soils from intensive management, such as agriculture, will decrease their N2O emissions. In this paper we report how the annual N2O emission rates will change when agricultural peat soil is either left abandoned or afforested and also N2O emissions from afforested peat extraction sites. In addition, we evaluated a biogeochemical model (DNDC) with a view to explaining GHG emissions from peat soils under different land uses. The abandoned agricultural peat soils had lower mean annual N2O emissions (5.5 +/- A 5.4 kg N ha(-1)) than the peat soils in active agricultural use in Finland. Surprisingly, N2O emissions from afforested organic agricultural soils (12.8 +/- A 9.4 kg N ha(-1)) were similar to those from organic agricultural soils in active use. These emissions were much higher than those from the forests on nutrient rich peat soils. Abandoned and afforested peat extraction sites emitted more N2O, (2.4 +/- A 2.1 kg N ha(-1)), than the areas under active peat extraction (0.7 +/- A 0.5 kg N ha(-1)). Emissions outside the growing season contributed significantly, 40% on an average, to the annual emissions. The DNDC model overestimated N2O emission rates during the growing season and indicated no emissions during winter. The differences in the N2O emission rates were not associated with the age of the land use change, vegetation characteristics, peat depth or peat bulk density. The highest N2O emissions occurred when the soil C:N ratio was below 20 with a significant variability within the measured C:N range (13-27). Low soil pH, high nitrate availability and water table depth (50-70 cm) were also associated with high N2O emissions. Mineral soil has been added to most of the soils studied here to improve the fertility and this may have an impact on the N2O emissions. We infer from the multi-site dataset presented in this paper that afforestation is not necessarily an efficient way to reduce N2O emissions from drained boreal organic fields.

AB We investigated the influence of site characteristics and soil properties on the chemical composition of organic matter in soils collected from a latitudinal transect across northern cold-region through analysis of diffuse reflectance Fourier transform mid infrared (DRIFT) spectra of bulk soils. The study included 119 soil samples collected from 28 sites including tundra, boreal forest, grassland, and coastal rainforest ecosystems. Organic, mineral, and cryoturbated soil horizons, both seasonally and perennially frozen, representing a variety of depths and edaphic conditions were examined. The amount and chemical composition of organic matter, as well as site and soil properties, exerted a strong influence on the DRIFT spectra. The spectra were highly sensitive to the extent of organic matter decomposition, enabling the ordination of organic (0i, Oe and Oa) horizons. Differences in absorbance intensity for several spectral bands indicated that Oi horizons contained greater abundance of relatively fresh residues, phenolic-OH compounds, aliphatic compounds, and carbohydrates. In contrast, Oa horizons had a greater presence of amide groups, aromatics, C=C bonds, carboxylates and carboxylic acids. Another significant factor differentiating these horizons was the incorporation of clays and silicates into the Oa horizons. Calculated ratios of characteristic spectral bands showed a clear trend of increasing decomposition from Oi to Oe to Oa. The DRIFT spectra were related to many site/soil attributes including land cover type, parent material, and associated factors, such as permafrost presence/absence, drainage class, horizon depth, bulk density, cation exchange capacity, and pH. A single DRIFT spectral band was identified that might be used in future studies to quickly estimate the organic carbon, total nitrogen, and carbon:nitrogen ratios of northern soils. Our results demonstrate that the information contained in DRIFT spectra of soil integrates the quantity and chemical composition of soil organic matter with soil properties and highlights the potential for using this information to assess the degradation state of organic matter stored in northern cold-region soils.

AB Holocene variations of Bjornbreen, Smorstabbtinden massif, west-central Jotunheimen are reconstructed from the lithostratigraphy of two alpine stream-bank mires flooded episodically by meltwater. The approach uses multiple sedimentological indicators (weight loss-on-ignition, mean grain size, grain-size fractions, bulk density, moisture content and magnetic susceptibility), an a priori model of overbank deposition of suspended glaciofluvial sediments, a detailed chronology based on 56 radiocarbon dates, and a Little Ice Age sedimentological analogue. Rapid, late-Preboreal deglaciation was indicated by immigration of Betula pubeseens by 9700 cal. BP. An interval of at least 3000 years in the early Holocene when glaciers were absent was interrupted by two abrupt episodes of, glacier expansion around the time of the Finse Event, the first at ca 8270-7900 cal. BP (Bjornbreen I Event) and the second at ca 7770-7540 cal. BP (Bjornbreen II Event). Neoglaciation began shortly before ca 5730 cal. BP with gradual build-up to the maximum of the Bjgrnbreen III Event at ca 4420 cal. BP. Later maxima occurred at ca 2750 cal. BP (Bjernbreen IV Event) and at 1300, 1260, 1060 and 790 cal. BP (all within the Bjornbreen V Event). Glaciers were smaller than today and possibly melted away on several occasions in the late Holocene (ca 3950, 1410 and 750 cal. BP). Minor maxima also occurred at ca 660 and 540 cal. BP, within the late Mediaeval Warm Period and the early Little Ice Age, respectively. The Little Ice Age maximum was dated to 213 25 BP (ca 205 cal. BP). The relative magnitudes of the main glacier maxima were determined: Erdalen Event > Little Ice Age Event (Bjornbreen VI) > Bjornbreen I (Finse Event) approximate to Bjgrnbreen II > Bjornbreen V greater than or equal to Bjornbreen IV > Bjornbreen III. These episodic events of varying magnitude and abruptness were used in conjunction with an independent summer-temperature proxy to reconstruct variations in equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) and a Holocene record of winter precipitation. Since the Preboreal, ELA varied within a range of about 390 m, and winter precipitation ranged between 40 and 160% of modern values. Winter precipitation variations appear to have been the main cause of these century- to millennial-scale Holocene glacier variations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mangroves are halophytic plants living at the land-sea interface and are therefore natural trackers of sea-level. Multiple proxies of a continuous (8 m) mangrove peat core (BT-79) from Spanish Lookout Cay, Belize illustrate mangrove ecosystem changes during the Holocene. Radiocarbon measurements show this site was colonized by mangroves similar to 8000 cal. yrs BP, with a significant decrease in the peat accumulation rate from similar to 6000 to 1000 cal. yrs BR Stratigraphic characteristics of this peat core such as bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and loss on ignition show relative uniformity, inferring an uninterrupted mangrove ecosystem during a majority of the Holocene. This is supported by pollen data from BT-79 that show that the site has been consistently dominated by Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), with Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove) present as well. Subfossil R. mangle leaves are used for stable nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotope (delta N-15, delta C-13, and delta O-18) analyses. delta N-15 and delta C-13 values provide a proxy of this plant's past physiology and stand structure showing that dwarf (delta N-15< - 3 parts per thousand) and tall (delta C-13 < - 27 parts per thousand) R. mangle stands were previously present at the site, which are a result of nutrient limitations that we equate with seawater inundation. delta O-18 values show differences in source water of R. mangle, with higher values attributed to the source water being composed of a greater proportion of seawater relative to precipitation. A decrease in inundation at the site is shown by lower delta O-18 values (<19 parts per thousand) from similar to 7000 to similar to 1000 cal. yrs BP that covary with the decreased sedimentation rate. Existing Caribbean sea-level data do not show evidence of a decrease in the rate of relative sea-level rise or fluctuations that we take to be the major causes of environmental changes at site BT-79.

AB For detailed reconstructions of atmospheric metal deposition using peat cores from bogs, a comprehensive protocol for working with peat cores is proposed. The first step is to locate and determine suitable sampling sites in accordance with the principal goal of the study, the period of time of interest and the precision required. Using the state of the art procedures and field equipment, peat cores are collected in such a way as to provide high quality records for paleoenvironmental study. Pertinent field observations gathered during the fieldwork are recorded in a field report. Cores are kept frozen at -18 degreesC until they can be prepared in the laboratory. Frozen peat cores are precisely cut into 1 cm slices using a stainless steel band saw with stainless steel blades. The outside edges of each slice are removed using a titanium knife to avoid any possible contamination which might have occurred during the sampling and handling stage. Each slice is split, with one-half kept frozen for future studies ( archived), and the other half further subdivided for physical, chemical, and mineralogical analyses. Physical parameters such as ash and water contents, the bulk density and the degree of decomposition of the peat are determined using established methods. A subsample is dried overnight at 105 degreesC in a drying oven and milled in a centrifugal mill with titanium sieve. Prior to any expensive and time consuming chemical procedures and analyses, the resulting powdered samples, after manual homogenisation, are measured for more than twenty-two major and trace elements using non-destructive X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) methods. This approach provides lots of valuable geochemical data which documents the natural geochemical processes which occur in the peat profiles and their possible effect on the trace metal profiles. The development, evaluation and use of peat cores from bogs as archives of high-resolution records of atmospheric deposition of mineral dust and trace elements have led to the development of many analytical procedures which now permit the measurement of a wide range of elements in peat samples such as lead and lead isotope ratios, mercury, arsenic, antimony, silver, molybdenum, thorium, uranium, rare earth elements. Radiometric methods (the carbon bomb pulse of C-14, Pb-210 and conventional C-14 dating) are combined to allow reliable age-depth models to be reconstructed for each peat profile.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effects of physical properties of peat-based substrate mixtures partially substituted with parboiled rice hulls (PRH) on plant growth and performance. Thirteen substrate mixtures were formulated by substituting 0, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70% peat with either parboiled ground rice hulls (GRH) or whole rice hulls (WRH) (by volume) in commercial potting mix (CPM) containing 70% peat, 20% perlite, and 10% vermiculite. All substrate mixtures consisted of mainly medium-sized (2.0-0.25 mm) particles. However, regardless of the mixing ratio, GRH significantly increased the medium-sized particles especially with diameters of 2.0-0.71 mm, while WRH increased both the medium- and coarse-sized (> 2.0 mm) particles. A higher mixing ratio of PRH increased air space and decreased container capacity but to a greater extent by WRH compared to GRH. Similarly, bulk density was increased with a higher mixing ratio of both types of PRH, but to a greater degree by GRH. Total porosity of GRH-containing substrates was similar to that of CPM within the range of 30-70%. The substrate mixtures containing PRH did not have the same physical properties as the CPM at any mixing ratio, but the values of some GRH-containing mixtures were within or close to the suggested ranges for greenhouse substrates. Considering the maximum substitution of PRH for peat, the substitution with 40% GRH (GRH-40) was selected for a plant growth study in comparison to CPM. Petunia (Petunia x hybrida) 'Easy Wave Neon Rose' and zinnia (Zinnia elegans) 'Benary's Giant Golden Yellow' were grown in pots containing CPM and GRH-40 at two irrigation levels: high (25-30%, by volume) and low (20-25%). Overall, shoot DW of both plant species was reduced in GRH-40, but root DW was maintained similar to those in CPM. The low irrigation level more significantly reduced shoot DW of petunia grown in CPM than in GRH-40, relative to their counterparts with the high irrigation level (20 and 7%, respectively); however, root growth of plant species grown in GRH-40 was either maintained or tended to be maintained even at the low irrigation level compared to their high irrigation counterparts. The water use efficiency of plants grown in GRH-40 was not significantly different from those in CPM regardless of irrigation level. These results indicate that GRH-40 provides desirable physical properties and water release characteristics, allowing more available water for plants under low irrigation levels than CPM. We concluded that substituting peat with 40% GRH in a commercial potting mix is a sustainable approach to produce petunia and zinnia.

AB Green roofs have received increased interest as a result of their environmental, social, and economic benefits. The present study aims to evaluate suitable, lightweight substrates for the installation of semi-intensive-type green roofs and their effects on Lavandula angustifolia growth and physiological status under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The study was conducted in field containers (1.2 x 1.2 m), and treatments included the use of two depths (20 cm or 30 cm) and three different substrates: 1) pumice (Pum) mixed with peat (P) and zeolite (Z) in a volumetric proportion of 65:30:5 (Pum(65):P-30:Z(5)); 2) pumice mixed with compost (C) and zeolite in a volumetric proportion of 65:30:5 (Pum(65):C-30:Z(5)); and 3) sandy loam soil (S) mixed with perlite (Per) and zeolite in a volumetric proportion of 30:65:5 (S-30:Per(65):Z(5)). Each experimental plot was planted with four plants of L. angustifolia. The physical and chemical characteristics of the substrates and the in situ substrate moisture levels were determined. Plant growth was determined by the growth index and root dry weight, whereas the plant physiological status during the stressful summer period was determined by chlorophyll(a+b) content and stomatal resistance. It was found that the bulk density of all of the substrates was less than 0.8 g-cm(-3), whereas the water retention of substrate S-30:Per(65):Z(5) was greater than the other two substrates at all tensions. Substrate depth was the most influential factor; therefore, the deeper substrates (30 cm) provided higher growth indices and root dry weight, increased total chlorophyll content, and reduced leaf stomatal resistance compared with the shallower substrate depth of 20 cm. Differences between substrate types were smaller compared with those of substrate depth. In spring, the growth index in substrate Pum(65):C-30:Z(5) was larger but not in the summer when the growth index of substrates S-30:Per(65):Z(5) and Pum(65):P-30:Z(5) exceeded that of the substrate amended with compost until the end of the study. In late summer, the plant total chlorophyll content decreased in all substrates, whereas substrate Pum(65):C-30:Z(5) exhibited increased stomatal resistance compared with the other two substrates at the same period. It was concluded that L. angustifolia could be grown successfully in semi-intensive Mediterranean green roofs at a substrate depth of 20 cm, but its growth and tolerance to the harsh summer conditions would improve at a substrate depth of 30 cm.

AB The effect of salt concentration, organic matter bulk density, and moisture content on the thermal conductivity of some sieved and repacked soils was investigated through laboratory studies. These laboratory experiments used the single probe method to determine thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity observed in this study under varying water content soil density and soil texture was compared with independent estimates made using standard procedures of Campbell (1985). The differences between the observed and predicted results were very small. Fundamental information on how salts, water and organic matter affect thermal conductivity of soil would be useful in modeling water and energy movement in systems containing salt-affected soils. The soils used were classified as sand, sandy loam, foam, and clay foam. The three salts used were sodium chloride (NaCl), magnesium chloride (MgCl2), and calcium chloride (CaCl2) while addition of peat moss was to increase the organic matter content. For the type of soils studied, thermal conductivity increased with increased soil density and moisture content. Thermal conductivity ranged from 0.43 to 0.98 for sand from 0.35 to 0.55 for sandy loam, from 0.34 to 0.50 for foam, and from 0.29 to 0.44 W/m K for clay loam at densities from 1.30 to 1.50 g/cm(3) and water contents from 0.06 to 010 cm(3)/cm(3). The results also showed that thermal conductivity decreased with an increase in the amount of added salts. Thermal conductivity for sand ranged from 1.17 to 0.56 W/m K at concentrations of NaCl from 0.02 to 0.10 kg/kg, from 1.13 to 0.52 W/m K at concentrations of CaCl2 from 0.01 to 0.05 kg/kg, and from 1.05 to 0.45 W/m K at concentrations of MgCl2 from 0.01 to 0.05 kg/kg. Thermal conductivity for clay loam ranged from 0.61 to 0.16 W/m K at concentrations of NaCl from 0.02 to 0.10 kg/kg, from 0.58 to 0.10 W/m K at concentrations of CaCl2 from 0.01 to 0.05 kg/kg, and from 0.55 to 0.08 W/m K at concentrations of MgCl2 from 0.01 to 0.05 kg/kg. At a given moisture content, increasing the percentage of soil organic matter decreased thermal conductivity. Finally, thermal conductivity values were higher for sand than for clay loam for the same salt type and concentration. The measurements concerning salts and organic matter are an important contribution to an important and little studied field.

AB Turfgrass use in adaptive extensive green roof systems could provide a sustainable solution for increasing urban greening in semi-arid regions. The aim of the study was as follows: (i) to investigate the effects of four different substrate formulations from locally available materials (S-15:Pum(60):P-20:Z(5), S-15:Pum(60):C-20:Z(5), S-30:Pum(40):P-20:Z(10), and S-30:Pum(40):C-20:Z(10), where S, sandy loam soil; Pum, pumice; P, peat; C, compost; and Z, zeolite in volumetric proportions as indicated by their subscripts), and two substrate depths (7.5 cm and 15 cm) on the lateral growth of Manilagrass (Zoysia matrella L [Merr.] 'Zeon'); (ii) to evaluate the capacity of locally produced compost to be substituted for peat as an organic substrate amendment in an effort to reduce its horticultural use; (iii) to determine the effect of increasing soil participation in substrate formulations on growth and drought resistance of Manilagrass; (iv) to evaluate the effects of the four substrate types and two substrate depths on Manilagrass drought resistance. The measurements included: (a) determination of substrate characteristics, such as particle size distribution, saturated and dry bulk density, total porosity, water potential curves, in situ substrate moisture, pH and electrical conductivity and (b) determination of turfgrass quality and physiological status that included green turf cover (GTC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and leaf stomatal resistance (LSR). It was found that during establishment, when adequate irrigation of turfgrass was applied, the deeper profiles (15 cm) combined with compost-amended substrates (S-15:Pum(60):C-20:Z(5) and S-30:Pum(40):C-20:Z(10)) provided higher GTC values while the shallow profiles (7.5 cm) with peat-amended substrates (S-15:Pum(60):P-20:Z(5) and S-30:Pum(40):P-20:Z(10)) provided the lowest GTC. The opposite phenomenon was observed during water-deficit periods, since the peat-amended substrate S-15:Pum(60):P-20:Z(5) combined with the deeper profile (15 cm) resulted in the least drought stress imposition to Manilagrass while providing the highest GTC and NDVI and the lowest LSR values. By contrast, the compost-amended substrates S-15:Pum(60):C-20:Z(5) and S-30:Pum(40):C-20:Z(10) increased the drought stress imposition to Manilagrass when combined with shallow profiles (7.5 cm). Substrate depth was the most influential factor, since Manilagrass drought stress was alleviated as substrate depth increased from 7.5 cm to 15 cm. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB We reconstructed the late-Holocene environmental history of a coastal lagoon in semi-arid southwestern Hispaniola through multiproxy analysis of a sediment core, including pollen, macroscopic and microscopic charcoal, loss-on-ignition analysis (LOI), stable isotope analysis, bulk density, and magnetic susceptibility. Four chronological accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates indicated that our core represents the past similar to 1000 years. We interpreted ten hurricanes events over the past millennium from high-resolution geological proxies, LOI data, and ostracod valve stable oxygen isotope data, thus producing the first long record of hurricanes from the Dominican Republic. Geological proxies indicated a high-energy event abruptly changed the ecosystem state of our core site from a shallow mangrove wetland to a lacustrine environment similar to 330 cal yr BP. We interpret the driver of that event to be the landfall of a strong hurricane that initiated lowland flooding, mangrove mortality, and subsequent peat collapse at the core site. Pollen data indicated that during the relatively moist Medieval Warm Period (MWP), hurricanes led to temporary declines in tropical dry forest taxa that recovered within several decades following disturbance. By comparison, during the relatively arid Little Ice Age (LIA), when precipitation was highly variable in the circum-Caribbean, closely spaced hurricanes seemed to delay forest recovery. Sedimentary charcoal concentrations revealed increased fire activity after inferred hurricane landfalls in the MWP, providing evidence of a link between enhanced biomass and fuel availability during moister periods and burning in recently disturbed dry forests and scrub of our semi-arid study region. Our interpretations of increased aridity and precipitation variability, indicated by alternating thin layers of microbial mats with evaporite layers, along with more frequent hurricanes from similar to 330 cal yr BP to present, generally agree with other sedimentary records from the circum-Caribbean, and may be linked to a more southerly position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone during the LIA.

AB The climates on the eastern Tibetan Plateau are strongly influenced by direct insolation heating as well as monsoon-derived precipitation change. However, the moisture and temperature influences on regional vegetation and climate have not been well documented in paleoclimate studies. Here we present a well-dated and high-resolution loss-on-ignition, peat property and fossil pollen record over the last 10,000 years from a sedge-dominated fen peatland in the central Zoige Basin on the eastern Tibetan Plateau and discuss its ecological and climatic interpretations. Lithology results indicate that organic matter content is high at 60-80% between 10 and 3 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP) and shows large-magnitude fluctuations in the last 3000 years. Ash-free bulk density, as a proxy of peat decomposition and peatland surface moisture conditions, oscillates around a mean value of 0.1 g/cm(3), with low values at 6.5-4.7 ka, reflecting a wet interval, and an increasing trend from 4.7 to 2 ka, suggesting a drying trend. The time-averaged mean carbon accumulation rates are 30.6 gC/m(2)/yr for the last 10,000 years, higher than that from many northern peatlands. Tree pollen (mainly from Picea), mostly reflecting temperature change in this alpine meadow-forest ecotonal region, has variable values (from 3 to 34%) during the early Holocene, reaches the peak value during the mid-Holocene at 6.5 ka, and then decreases until 2 ka. The combined peat property and pollen data indicate that a warm and wet climate prevailed in the mid-Holocene (6.5-4.7 ka), representing a monsoon maximum or "optimum climate" for the region. The timing is consistent with recent paleo-monsoon records from southern China and with the idea that the interplays of summer insolation and other extratropical large-scale boundary conditions, including sea-surface temperature and sea-level change, control regional climate. The cooling and drying trend since the mid-Holocene likely reflects the decrease in insolation heating and weakening of summer monsoons. Regional synthesis of five pollen records along a south north transect indicates that this climate pattern can be recognized all across the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The peatland and vegetation changes in the late Holocene suggest complex and dramatic responses of these lowland and upland ecosystems to changes in temperature and moisture conditions and human activities.

AB Bogs are nutrient poor, acidic ecosystems that receive their water and nutrients entirely from precipitation (= ombrogenous) and as a result are sensitive to nutrient loading from atmospheric sources. Bogs occur frequently on the northern Alberta landscape, estimated to cover 6% of the Athabasca Oil Sands Area. As a result of oil sand extraction and processing, emissions of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) to the atmosphere have led to increasing N and S deposition that have the potential to alter the structure and function of these traditionally nutrient-poor ecosystems. At present, no detailed protocol is available for monitoring potential change of these sensitive ecosystems. We propose a user-friendly protocol that will monitor potential plant and lichen responses to future environmental inputs of nutrients and provide a structured means for collecting annual data. The protocol centers on measurement of five key plant/lichen attributes, including changes in (1) plant abundances, (2) dominant shrub annual growth and primary production, (3) lichen health estimated through chlorophyll/phaeophytin concentrations, (4) Sphagnum annual growth and production, and (5) annual growth of the dominant tree species (Picea mariana). We placed five permanent plots in each of six bogs located at different distances from the center of oil sand extraction and sampled these for 2 years (2018 and 2019). We compared line intercept with point intercept plant assessments using NMDS ordination, concluding that both methods provide comparable data. These data indicated that each of our six bog sites differ in key species abundances. Structural differences were apparent for the six sites between years. These differences were mostly driven by changes in Vaccinium oxycoccos, not the dominant shrubs. We developed allometric growth equations for the dominant two shrubs (Rhododendron groenlandicum and Chamaedaphne calyculata). Equations developed for each of the six sites produced growth values that were not different from one another nor from one developed using data from all sites. Annual growth of R. groenlandicum differed between sites, but not years, whereas growth of C. calyculata differed between the 2 years with more growth in 2018 compared with 2019. In comparison, Sphagnum plant density and stem bulk density both had strong site differences, with stem mass density higher in 2019. When combined, annual production of S. fuscum was greater in 2019 at three sites and not different at three of the sites. Chlorophyll and phaeophytin concentrations from the epiphytic lichen Evernia mesomorpha also differed between sites and years. This protocol for field assessments of five key plant/lichen response variables indicated that both site and year are factors that must be accounted for in future assessments. A portion of the site variation was related to patterns of N and S deposition.

AB Ascariasis is considered a common parasitosis of swine worldwide. The disease causes significant economic losses due to its effect on feed conversion ratio and liver condemnations at slaughter (liver milk spots).
   This study aimed to characterise the between-farm and spatial variance in porcine ascariasis in England and to assess the association between the percentage of infected animals and potential environmental risk factors, including production system, socioeconomic deprivation, soil characteristics (pH, topsoil bulk density, topsoil organic matter, topsoil texture class, soil water regime, topsoil available water capacity, and elevation), and climatic conditions (relative humidity, air temperature, and rainfall) before slaughter.
   Post-mortem inspection results were provided by the Food Standards Agency and comprised information about the number of rejected livers, the number of animals sent to slaughter and the production system. All farms were georeferenced based on the postcode, which allowed the assessment of the area index of socioeconomic deprivation and the extraction of soil and climatic characteristics available in different online databases. Under a multilevel framework with adjustment for spatial autocorrelation, a standard linear mixed model was fitted to estimate the association between these determinants and the percentage of infected animals.
   From 2,513,973 English farmed pigs included in the study, 4.3% had their livers rejected due to milk spots. The percentage of infected pigs per batch ranged from 0% to 100%. The highest percentages were found in Surrey, East and West Sussex (8.9%) and lowest in Leicestershire, Rutland and Northamptonshire (2.0%). Significant associations were found at multivariable analysis between the proportion of infection and the number of animals sent to slaughter (beta = -0.005; 95%CI = - 0.005, - 0.004), soil texture (peat compared to coarse textured soils; beta = - 0.516; 95%CI = -1.010, - 0.063), relative humidity (beta = 0.011; 95%CI = 0.006, 0.015), mean temperature (beta = 0.007; 95%CI = 0.003, 0.012), and rainfall (beta = 0.022; 95%CI = 0.004, 0.037).
   In conclusion, our findings suggest that ascariasis can be influenced by a complex network of environmental factors. Future research needs to acknowledge these intermingled relationships to guide the development and application of control measures by the industry.

AB Accurate measurement of soil moisture (theta), bulk electrical conductivity (sigma(b)), and porewater electrical conductivity (sigma(w)) in the vadose zone is critical for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. The use of combined dielectric probes allows for the automated collection of high-resolution, long-term data, however variation in probe response to different soil types can lead to unacceptably large measurement errors, especially in soils with high organic content such as those found in wetlands. The objectives of this study were to calibrate and field-test a combined, capacitance-based dielectric probe for three soil series encountered in the floodplain of a southeastern (USA) coastal river where watershed modifications have led to reduced freshwater flow and saltwater intrusion. To calibrate the probe, floodplain soils were categorized into three groups: a low organic content fine sand; a moderately organic, depositional fluvent soil; and a highly organic muck. PVC soil cores were packed at field bulk density, and theta and sigma(b) were measured in the lab over a range of soil moistures (pressure potentials of 0-333 cm H2O) and sigma(w) values (0.01-1.0 S/m). Soil dielectric properties measured with the probe were used to test several potential models relating real and imaginary dielectric constants to theta, sigma(b), and sigma(w). Soil-specific calibrations improved theta estimation over standard manufacturer calibrations, particularly for the more organic soils. Of all theta-sigma(b)-sigma(w) models tested, the empirical relationship proposed by Vogeler et al. (1996) performed the best (overall R-2=0.97 for the three soils), though all models performed well in all soils (0.94 <= R-2 <= 0.98) and each can be selected for the specific range of sigma(b) expected in the field. Calibrations were successfully tested in the field by comparing in-ground probe estimates of sigma(w) with collocated soil water samples. These calibrations add to the limited published data available for soils of high organic content and support accurate monitoring of the vadose zone in coastal wetlands to inform restoration and management of these valued ecosystems.

AB The organic-carbon (OC) pool accumulated in Arctic permafrost (perennially frozen ground) equals the carbon stored in the modern atmosphere. To give an idea of how Yedoma region permafrost could respond under future climatic warming, we conducted a study to quantify the organic-matter quality (here defined as the intrinsic potential to be further transformed, decomposed, and mineralized) of late Pleistocene (Yedoma) and Holocene (thermokarst) deposits on the Buor-Khaya Peninsula, northeast Siberia. The objective of this study was to develop a stratigraphic classified organic-matter quality characterization. For this purpose the degree of organic-matter decomposition was estimated by using a multiproxy approach. We applied sedimentological (grain-size analyses, bulk density, ice content) and geochemical parameters (total OC, stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13),total organic carbon : nitrogen (C / N) ratios) as well as lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes, n-fatty acids, hopanes, triterpenoids, and biomarker indices, i.e., average chain length, carbon preference index (CPI), and higher-plant fatty-acid index (HPFA)). Our results show that the Yedoma and thermokarst organic-matter qualities for further decomposition exhibit no obvious degradation-depth trend. Relatively, the C / N and delta C-13 values and the HPFA index show a significantly better preservation of the organic matter stored in thermokarst deposits compared to Yedoma deposits. The CPI data suggest less degradation of the organic matter from both deposits, with a higher value for Yedoma organic matter. As the interquartile ranges of the proxies mostly over-lap, we interpret this as indicating comparable quality for further decomposition for both kinds of deposits with likely better thermokarst organic-matter quality. Supported by principal component analyses, the sediment parameters and quality proxies of Yedoma and thermokarst deposits could not be unambiguously separated from each other. This revealed that the organic-matter vulnerability is heterogeneous and depends on different decomposition trajectories and the previous decomposition and preservation history. Elucidating this was one of the major new contributions of our multiproxy study. With the addition of biomarker data, it was possible to show that permafrost organic-matter degradation likely occurs via a combination of (uncompleted) degradation cycles or a cascade of degradation steps rather than as a linear function of age or sediment facies. We conclude that the amount of organic matter in the studied sediments is high for mineral soils and of good quality and therefore susceptible to future decomposition. The lack of depth trends shows that permafrost acts like a giant freezer, preserving the constant quality of ancient organic matter. When undecomposed Yedoma organic matter is mobilized via thermokarst processes, the fate of this carbon depends largely on the environmental conditions; the carbon could be preserved in an undecomposed state till refreezing occurs. If modern input has occurred, thermokarst organic matter could be of a better quality for future microbial decomposition than that found in Yedoma deposits.

AB The availability of coarse woody debris (CWD) and distribution of dead trees into categories of mortality (dead standing, broken and uprooted) were investigated in north-temperate forests of central Europe (Lithuania). The studied area comprised 188.7 ha and included 18 different stands 40-130 years of age with a variety of tree species (spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.), birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh.), aspen (Populus tremula L.), oak (Quercus robur L.), forest types (caricus-sphagnum, vaccinium-myrtillus, oxalis, myrtillus-oxalis, caricus-calamagrostis) and edaphic conditions (peaty, sandy, loamy soils of different moisture). The stands were excluded from wood 3 harvesting for at least 30 years. A total of 11 365 dead trees (over 10 cm in DBH) or 6160.7 m(3) of dead wood was found (60.2 trees/ha and 32.6 m(3) /ha). The volume of CWD per hectare was larger in older stands (r(S) = 0.78, P < 0.01). Tree mortality 3 during the last 2 years consisted of 482 trees and 381 m(3), or 1.28 trees/ha x year and 1.01 m(3) /ha x year. In 25-33% of cases it was wind-related. Uprooted and broken trees were of larger DBH than dead standing. The distribution into the categories of mortality was strongly dependent on tree species (chi-square test, d.f. = 10, P = 0). Dead standing dominated in CWD of pine and alder. Broken trees comprised almost a half in CWD of aspen, and about one-third in birch, alder and oak. Uprooting most often occurred in spruce, aspen and birch. Edaphic conditions and stand age had a pronounced impact on distribution into mortality categories for spruce (chi-square test, d.f. = 20, P < 0.00001) and pine (d.f. = 8, P less than or equal to 0.0003). On peat soil, only a minority of trees of both pine and spruce was uprooted, and standing dead prevailed. In CWD of spruce and pine, the proportions of both dead standing and broken decreased and that of uprooted trees increased on mineral soils of higher moisture and bulk density in older stands. By contrast, uprooting in birch and alder occurred less often on more wet sites, where the proportions of standing snags were higher. A total of 41 species of wood-decomposing polypores were found in the study area. Among those, 10 (24%) were of conservation value. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES
AB Mandated processing of waste by-products in the United States has inspired national interest in addressing the effectiveness of using composted biosolids and yard trimmings to grow containerized plants. Diamond bay Chinese evergreen (Aglaonema 'Diamond Bay') was transplanted in containers filled with one of eight formulated media (components added by volume). Medium 1 was a standard mix commonly used in Aglaonema production (5:2:3 peat-vermiculite-perlite); medium 2 was formulated on site to contain peat-bark-stalite-rice hulls-coir (2:2:3:1:2); media 3 and 4 contained 40% biosolid-yard waste compost instead of peat and with or without 20% stalite, respectively; and media 5, 6, 7, and 8 were commercially formulated to contain peat-bark-perlite-rice hulls-coir (4:1.5:2.5:1:1, 4:1.5:2.5:1:1, 4:2:2:1:1, and 3.0:2.5:2:1:1.5, respectively). Physical and chemical properties of the eight media were in ranges 50-65% container water-holding capacity, 2.9-7.8% air-filled porosity, 55-80% moisture (w/w), 0.11-0.37g center dot cm3 bulk density, 0.34-0.96g center dot cm3 particle density, 4.2-7.2pH, 0.12-4.4dS center dot m-1 electrical conductivity (EC), 27.3-54.5meg/100g cation exchange capacity (CEC), 17.9-39.0% carbon (C), and 0.22-1.7% nitrogen (N). Medium 4 (40% compost) had 5.5 times more ammoniacal N (NH4-N) and 1.7 times more nitrate N (NO3-N) than that of the standard commercial mix. At week 8, plants grown in media 2 and 5 were 8.9% to 9.5% taller than plants grown in medium 1 (commercial standard). At week 16, there were no significant differences in plant heights or growth indices among media. At week 24, there were no significant differences in plant height, growth index, visual quality, shoot dry weight, and root dry weight among media. However, cumulative phosphorus (P) leaching from media 1, 4, and 5 was significantly more than leaching from media 2 and 8. This study suggests that compost may serve as a horticulturally suitable and cost-effective alternative to peat-based media for Aglaonema production.

AB Decomposition of organic substances is one of the main processes responsible for the signatures of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in soils and peats. However, the applicability of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures at the natural abundance level as indicators of the degree of peat decomposition is still debatable. We evaluated delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth patterns of peat cores sampled at nine sites in two nearby Alpine peat bogs with varying degree of organic matter degradation. Based on water table depths and past drainage intensities, the peat cores were divided into three degradation classes. We found similar overall depths patterns of delta C-13 and delta N-15 across the nine depth profiles and distinct differences between aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. Considerable differences in stable C and N isotope signatures of same depths were detected between profiles of the three classes, whereas depth profiles of peat cores with similar degree in peatland degradation were nearly identical. In the aerobic peat layers, delta C-13 and delta N-15 increased with depths at all study sites from 2.6 parts per thousand to 4.9 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 3.2 parts per thousand to 7.0 parts per thousand for delta N-15 compared to the initial signatures of the plant biomass. Standardised delta C-13 of aerobic layers differ distinctly between slightly degraded pests at the open peat bog area, intermediately degraded peats at the tree-covered edge areas and strongly degraded pests at the former peat-cutting site. delta C-13 signatures of aerobic layers of strongly degraded pests were markedly more negative compared to the slightly degraded peats because of the selective C-12 losses by microbial respiration. delta N-15 were more positive at strongly degraded than at slightly degraded sites in both, aerobic and anaerobic peat layers. The uniform stable isotope ratios in the anaerobic layers deeper than the local maxima of the isotopic signatures support the assumption that minor C-13 fractionation occurs under anaerobic conditions. delta C-13 slightly declining with depth in the waterlogged layers of strongly degraded peat reflects the preferential utilisation and loss of labile organic compounds enriched in C-13. delta N-15 of strongly degraded pests was higher compared to well-conserved peat The close relationship between the measured delta N-15 to delta N-15 modelled based on C:N ratios and bulk densities supports the assumption that the delta N-15 signature is the result of isotopic fractionation by peat decomposition. We conclude that peat decomposition strongly affects the delta C-13 and delta N-15 depth profiles of peat bogs and most likely overrides other factors, such as differences between plant species, litter components, atmospheric delta C-13 shift during peat formation, temperature effects, or type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.

   Peat and net carbon accumulation rates in two sub-arctic peat plateaus of west-central Canada have been studied through geochemical analyses and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating. The peatland sites started to develop around 6600-5900 cal. yr BP and the peat plateau stages are characterized by Sphagnum fuscum peat alternating with rootlet layers. The long-term peat and net carbon accumulation rates for both profiles are 0.30-0.31 mm/yr and 12.5-12.7 gC/m(2)yr, respectively. These values reflect very slow peat accumulation (0.04-0.09 mm/yr) and net carbon accumulation (3.7-5.2 gC/m(2)yr) in the top rootlet layers. Extensive AMS radiocarbon dating of one profile shows that accumulation rates are variable depending on peat plateau stage. Peat accumulation rates are up to six times higher and net carbon accumulation rates up to four times higher in S. fuscum than in rootlet stages. Local fires represented by charcoal remains in some of the rootlet layers result in very low accumulation rates. High C/N ratios throughout most of the peat profiles suggest low degrees of decomposition due to stable permafrost conditions. Hence, original peat accretion has remained largely unaltered, except in the initial stages of peatland development when permafrost was not yet present.

TI EFFECT OF INSITU GAS ACCUMULATION ON THE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY OF PEAT
SO SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER; TRANSMISSION; DEPTH; FLOW
AB The in situ hydraulic conductivity of moderately decomposed, catotelm (subsurface) peat is often anomalously low (10(-5) to 10(-7) cm s-1) considering that the porosity (n) of this peat is often as high as 80-97%, and the dry bulk density (rho(b)) as low as 0.05-0.25 g cm-3. It has recently been hypothesized that this is the result of a progressive occlusion of pores in the peat matrix by bubbles of gas (especially methane) which are generated in-situ by ongoing anaerobic respiration. To test this hypothesis, the change with time of hydraulic conductivity (K), volumetric water content (THETA), volumetric gas content (gamma), and gaseous methane concentration (M) were measured in three, repacked laboratory columns of catotelm peat through which de-aired, temperature equilibrated water flowed continuously under positive pressure. Two of the columns contained microbially active peat which was packed to average n and rho(b) values of 96.2% and 0.06 g cm-3, respectively. The third column was similarly packed (n = 95.5%, rho(b) = 0.07 g cm-3) and then sterilized using 5.5 Mrad Co-60 gamma radiation to render it microbially inactive. In the two unsterilized columns, K decreased on average from 7.0 x 10(-4) (+/- 6.1 x 10(-4)) cms-1  to 1.8 x 10(-5) (+/-1.7 x 10(-5)) cms-1; THETA decreased from 83.6% (+/- 3.6) to 64.6% (+/- 6.4); gamma increased from 12.5% (+/- 3.2) to 31.6% (+/- 6.4); and M increased from 3.9 (+/- 1.5)mu-mol ml-1 to 50.2 (+/- 14.9)mu-mol ml-1 during four separate measurement periods (two periods per column) which varied in length from 44 to 78 days. During a 41-day measurement period, K and THETA increased in the sterilized column to stable, relatively high values of 5.7 x 10(-3) cms-1 and 91.0%, respectively; gamma decreased to a stable low value of 4.5%; and only trace levels of M were detected. The changes and eventual stabilization of K, THETA and gamma in the sterilized column were due to the gradual removal by the flowing water of artifact carbon dioxide gas produced by the sterilization process. The lack of M and the low final gamma-value in the sterilized column indicate that no significant anaerobic respiration occurred during the measurement period. It was concluded that it is indeed possible for gas generated in situ by anaerobic respiration to cause a progressive and significant decrease in the K of moderately decomposed catotelm peat.

AB The paper assesses the effect of transformation of soil physical properties on the abundance of micromolluscs in the conditions of an urban park. The studies were carried out in Novooleksandrivskiy Park (Melitopol, Ukraine). An experimental polygon was represented by 7 transects with 18 sampling points in each. The interval between the points in the transect, as well as the interval between transects, was 3 meters. The total area of the polygon was 1,134 m(2). The tree species growing within the polygon were Quercus robur, Sophora japonica, and Acer campestre. Shrubs were represented by Ulmus laevis, Tilia cordata, Celtis occidentalis, and Morus nigra. The locations of the trees and shrubs were mapped. The crowns of tree and shrub plants formed a dense canopy and a shady light regime. The grass cover was practically absent. The soil mechanical resistance, soil aggregate-size distribution, electrical conductivity of soil, soil moisture and bulk density were measured. We recorded 618 individuals of Vallonia pulchella, 120 individuals of Cochlicopa lubrica, and 58 individuals of Acanthinula aculeata within the surveyed polygon. We extracted three principal components, which could explain 60.9% of the variation in the feature space of the soil properties. The principal component 1 explained 42.0% of the variation of the feature space and depended on the soil penetration resistance throughout the whole profile, aggregate composition, density, electric conductivity and moisture content of soil. This component reflected a tendency for soil penetration resistance and soil density to increase near recreational trails. The principal component 1 was used to indicate the gradient of recreational transformation of the soil. The principal component 2 was able to explain 10.6% of the variation in the feature space. It negatively correlated with the distance from the recreational trail, soil penetration resistance at the depth of 35 cm or more, soil electrical conductivity, and the proportion of aggregates greater than 3 mm in size. This component positively correlated with soil penetration resistance at 0-5 cm depth and the proportion of aggregates less than 0.5 mm in size. This component can be interpreted as a "halo" from the recreational trail, or a gradient of indirect soil transformations adjacent to the zone of intense recreational load. The principal component 3 was able to explain 8.3% of the variation in the feature space. It positively correlated with soil penetration resistance at the depth of 20-40 cm, the proportion of 0.5-7.0 mm aggregates, and soil moisture. It negatively correlated with the proportion of aggregates larger than 7 mm and smaller than 0.25 mm. This component indicated a variation in soil properties that was induced by causes independent of recreational exposure. The extracted gradients of soil properties significantly influenced the abundance of micromollusc populations. The abundance of all species decreased after increase in recreational load. Micromollusc species responded to direct recreational exposure as plateau (C. lubrica) and asymmetric unimodal responses (V. pulchella and A. aculeata).

ID ISOTOPES; PEATLAND; MODELS
AB Matlabas is a mountain mire in Marakele National Park, located within the headwaters of the Limpopo River in South Africa. This mire consists of a complex of valley-bottom and seepage wetlands with small elevated peat domes. The occurrence of one decaying peat dome, which has burnt, and desiccated wetland areas with terrestrial vegetation has raised concerns. The aim of this study was to understand the mire features and water flows in order to identify the potential drivers causing wetland degradation. Wells and piezometers were installed to monitor the hydraulic head and collect water samples for analysis of ion composition, O-18 and H-2 stable isotope content, and delta C-13 and C-14 isotope content for radiocarbon dating. Moreover, peat temperature profiles were measured and peat deposits were also dated using radiocarbon. Results indicate that the Matlabas mire developed in the lowest central-east side of the valley by paludification at the onset of the Holocene. During the Mid-Holocene, peat development was extended laterally by autogenic and allogenic processes. Three types of water flows driving peat development were identified - sheet flow, phreatic groundwater flow and deep groundwater flow - two of which are surface or near surface flows. The recent occurrence of decaying peat domes and desiccated wetland areas is possibly related to loss of exfiltrating deep groundwater flows that have resulted from drainage by the head-cut channels in the mire and interception of near surface water flow by an access road, respectively. Interventions should be undertaken to prevent further degradation of the mire.
   Significance:
   This study is the first, as far as we are aware, on the ecohydrology of an inland mountainous mire in southern Africa.
   The results highlight the importance of the current wetland management (including rehabilitation) initiatives in South Africa.
   The integrative ecohydrological methods can be applied in other headwater wetlands in southern Africa.

AB Using a literature review, we argue that new models of peatland development are needed. Many existing models do not account for potentially important ecohydrological feedbacks, and/or ignore spatial structure and heterogeneity. Existing models, including those that simulate a near total loss of the northern peatland carbon store under a warming climate, may produce misleading results because they rely upon oversimplified representations of ecological and hydrological processes. In this, the first of a pair of papers, we present the conceptual framework for a model of peatland development, DigiBog, which considers peatlands as complex adaptive systems. DigiBog accounts for the interactions between the processes which govern litter production and peat decay, peat soil hydraulic properties, and peatland water-table behaviour, in a novel and genuinely ecohydrological manner. DigiBog consists of a number of interacting submodels, each representing a different aspect of peatland ecohydrology. Here we present in detail the mathematical and computational basis, as well as the implementation and testing, of the hydrological submodel. Remaining submodels are described and analysed in the accompanying paper. Tests of the hydrological submodel against analytical solutions for simple aquifers were highly successful: the greatest deviation between DigiBog and the analytical solutions was 2.83%. We also applied the hydrological submodel to irregularly shaped aquifers with heterogeneous hydraulic properties-situations for which no analytical solutions exist-and found the model's outputs to be plausible.

AB Net accumulation rates of carbon in a 9000 calendar year record of Sphagnum fuscum peat in western boreal Canada range from 13.6 to 34.9 g . m(-2). yr(-1). The depth vs. age curve is slightly convex due to generally declining net productivity at the site. Fossil carbon/nitrogen ratios of bulk Sphagnum fuscum peat and its components are used to calculate the rate and total amount of decay in the deeper anoxic peat deposits. The proportional rate of decay in the catotelm of the peatland declines linearly over lime. Carbon loss from the catotelm is estimated at 50% after 1700 calendar years and 65% after 7500 calendar years. Carbon has been added to the catotelm at an average rate of 28.0 g . m(-1). yr(-1) over the last 1174 years, whereas, at present, the cumulative loss of carbon over the entire catotelm is 19.4 g . m(-2). yr(-1). The peatland continues to represent a sink for carbon.

AB This study addresses differences in Sphagnum decay in the context of variations in physico-chemical peat properties linked to bog microtopography. The decay rates of six Sphagnum species were studied using litter bag techniques at Haukkasuo, a concentric raised bog in south-eastern Finland. The Sphagnum species were buried in their native microhabitats in oxic, intermittently anoxic and anoxic peat layers for one or two years. The hummock species generally decayed at slower rates than species growing in hollows and transitional zones of hollows (lawns). The average mean loss in mass of all Sphagnum species was 17.7 % after the first year and 18.6 % after two years. The mass loss correlated most positively with oxygen, carbon/nitrogen quotient and sodium, and most negatively with nitrogen, carbon, iron and depth in the native microhabitat. Knowledge about the litter quality of Sphagnum species is important for improving our understanding of ecosystem functions in northern peatlands, and particularly in relation to the development of microtopography.

AB Mires are frequently used as environmental archives of historical atmospheric deposition of trace elements and pollutants. This approach assumes that the elements of concern are immobile in the peat through time and space, because they are associated with dust particles or strongly bound to the organic substrate. Based on this assumption, records of element concentrations or accumulation rates are believed to reflect solely atmospheric fluxes. However, the influence of organic matter decomposition processes on element records in peat has only been poorly investigated. Here we present a study on the influence of peat decomposition and related mass loss on the fate of lithogenic elements (Si, Ti, Zr), metals and submetals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Ca, Zn, Pb, As, Hg) and organically bound elements (Cl, Br) in three ombrotrophic mires located in the Harz mountains, Germany. Concentrations in peat have been directly determined by means of micro-XRF and by CVAAS (Hg). Changes in peat decomposition and mass loss were based on C/N ratios. The identification of the main process affecting the concentrations of the elements in peat was statistically evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA). Results show that long term trends of decreasing peat decomposition towards the mires' surface are similar in the three bogs, but there is some within-bog variability on a short time scale. Concentration records of most of the investigated elements are strongly influenced by peat decomposition processes. Zirconium, Ti and Si, which are predominately hosted in dust particles, are exponentially enriched by mass (carbon) loss and increasing particle density during peat decay. The biophyllic (N) and organically bound elements (Cl and Br) are linearly enriched through mass loss and not affected by changes in particle density. Redox-sensitive elements (Fe, Mn, Cr) and the mobile nutrients Ca and Zn are assumed to be initially bound to the organic substrate but released and recycled during peat decay. Their distribution in the peat profiles is largely determined by dissolution and diffusion under changing redox-conditions caused by water table fluctuations. The strong influence of peat decomposition on the distribution of most of the investigated elements and the fact that peat decomposition in mires is to a large extent controlled by hydrological changes reveals that variations in element concentrations do not solely reflect changes in atmospheric deposition, but also changes in climate conditions. However, historically high atmospheric fluxes of Pb, As and Hg, related to the Harz' mining industry, predominately determine the observed changes in concentrations of these elements in the peat so that peat decomposition may have played only a minor role.

AB To predict future spatio-temporal patterns of climate change, we should fully understand the spatio-temporal patterns of climate change during the past millennium. But, we are not yet able to delineate the patterns because the qualities of the retrieved proxy records and the spatial coverage of those records are not adequate. Northern Xinjiang of China is one of such areas where the records are not adequate. Here, we present a 500-yr land-surface moisture sequence from Heiyangpo Peat (48.34A degrees N, 87.18A degrees E, 1353 m a.s.l) in the southern Altai Mountains within northern Xinjiang. Specifically, peat carbon isotope value of cellulose (delta C-13(cellulose)) was used to estimate the warm-season moisture variations and the degree of humification was used to constrain the delta C-13(cellulose)-based hydrological interpretation. The climatic attributions of the interpreted hydrological variations were based on the warm-season temperature reconstructed from Belukha ice core and the warm-season precipitation inferred from the reconstructed Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations (AMO). The results show that humification decreased and the delta C-13(cellulose)-suggested moisture decreased from similar to 1510 to similar to 1775 AD, implying that a constant drying condition may have inhibited peat decay. Our comparison with reconstructed climatic parameters suggests that the moisture-level decline was most likely resulted from a constant decline of precipitation. The results also show that humification kept a stable level and the delta C-13(cellulose)-suggested moisture also decreased from similar to 1775 to similar to 2013 AD, implying that peat decay in the acrotelm primarily did not depend on the water availability or an aerobic environment. Again, our comparison with reconstructed climatic parameters suggests that the land-surface moisturelevel decline was most likely resulted from a steady warming of growing-season temperature.

AB The high cation exchange capacity (CEC) of Sphagnum holocellulose may prevent bog peat decay by binding cations necessary for microbial activity. Sphagnum hollocellulose was extracted and added to peat to investigate the effect of increasing CEC on microbial activity. Holocellulose may also act as a carbon source. Thus the effect of different carbon sources was also investigated and holocellulose was added in combination with glucose. PbCl2 was added to peat to release cations bound by cation exchange singly and combined with a carbon source (glucose) or holocellulose. Carbon sources stimulated both CO2 and CH4 production. Sphagnum holocellulose also acted as a carbon source obscuring the effect it may have had through binding cations. PbCl2 increased cations measured in peat confirming that a large pool of essential cations is bound to peat. The cation release stimulated CH4 production when Pb was added alone but not in experiments when Pb was combined to a carbon source. Treatments decreased pH but experiments involving changing the pH showed that increasing the pH, and not decreasing it, stimulated CH4 production. Although there is some evidence that the high CEC of bog peat may have a role in preventing decay by sequestering essential cations; the lack of a carbon substrate is more important. We discuss these findings in relation to increasing N deposition and elevated CO2 concentrations, and the implications for carbon storage by peatlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In a context of climate change peatlands may switch from a sink to a source of carbon (C). The induced positive feedbacks are closely linked to C dynamics, and thus to the fate of organic matter (OM) in the underlying peat. Our aims were to determine how moisture conditions in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland affect the dynamics of diagenetic sensitive OM which is thought to be the most reactive to warming effects. The approach was based on the identification of combined bulk and molecular bioindicators of OM sources and decay of peat profiles (up to 50 cm in depth) from two moisture conditions of the Le Forbonnet peatland (Jura Mountains, France). The (xylose + arabinose)/(galactose + rhamnose + mannose) ratio derived from the analysis of neutral monosaccharides was used to obtain indications on the botanical origin of the peat and tended to indicate a greater contribution of Cyperaceae in the deepest parts of the peat. Most bioindicators showed that OM decay increased with depth and was higher in the driest conditions. In these conditions, decay was shown by a loss of diagenetic sensitive oxygen-rich OM, probably leached by water table fluctuations. Decay intensity was also shown by the high ribose and lyxose contents at the peat surface, where microscopic observations also revealed relatively large quantities of fungal hyphae. The sugars could have arisen from microbial synthesis, primarily protozoan and fungal activity. These results suggest that water level changes preferentially impact biochemical changes in diagenetic sensitive OM, believed to be sensitive to drought events.

AB Decomposition rates, measured as proportion of original ash-free dry mass lost from litter bags, were studied on four microhabitats of an ombrogenous peatland in southwestern Scotland: a Racomitrium lanuginosum hummock (HR), a Sphagnum capillifolium hummock (HS), a Sphagnum papillosum lawn (L), and a Sphagnum cuspidatum hollow (H). Reciprocal transplant experiments, in which litter bags were swapped among depths both within and among microhabitat types, separated the effects of litter quality (litter type and degree of humification of the peat) and microenvironment (water table position and microhabitat type). All were important determinants of mass loss. Decomposability of the litter from different microhabitats increased in the order HR < HS < L < H. Chemical 'ageing' of the peat reduced rates of decay in highly humified peat, although a history of decay was associated with maximum decomposability of peat from HR hummocks. The suitability of hollows for decay was significantly less than for HR and HS hummocks and lawns. Feat lost mass most slowly when placed below the lowest water table, but the highest mass losses were for peat placed in, or slightly above, the zone of water table fluctuation. Mass loss decreased with depth for peat decaying in its natural position in hollows and lawns and the oxic layer of HS hummocks. A peak in mass loss occurred within the zone of water table fluctuation in HS hummocks, and just above the highest water table in HR hummocks. The results support earlier suggestions that differences due to chemical ageing of peat contribute to differences in decomposition rates between hummocks and hollows, and that hummock species are intrinsically more resistant to decay than hollow species. The pattern was complicated further, however, by the effects of water table position and microhabitat type. The combined effects of litter quality (species composition and degree of humification of the litter) and environment (microhabitat of incubation and position of incubation relative to water table) are complex, and these complexities must be incorporated into models of decomposition.

AB The poor fens of the Laforge region, northeastern Canada, have developed under subarctic conditions. They are characterized by a microtopography of large pools and low, narrow strings. Paleorecords suggest some of these systems were once ombrotrophic and relatively dry. Taking account of their current bioclimatic position, we aimed to explore the possible pathways towards the current wet state, a process referred to as "aqualysis". We combined paleoecological methods applied to a peat core with conceptual modelling to identify factors that might plausibly explain aqualysis. Reconstructions showed the Abeille peatland became minerotrophic with high water tables between 2400 and 2100 cal yr BP. Conceptual modelling, supported by simulations using the numerical DigiBog model, allowed us to identify the effects of cooling and increased precipitation on productivity, decay, peat hydraulic conductivity and vertical peat accumulation. Both cooling and increased precipitation were required for aqualysis to occur and for wet surface conditions to persist to the present day. Increased recharge from the catchment, which also restricted drainage from the peatland center laterally, was likely critical for the development of minerotrophic conditions. The scenario of cooling and wetting in these peatlands is supported by available paleoclimate records for eastern Canada.

AB In this study we provide a quantification of the main patterns of change of a subarctic peatland caused by permafrost decay monitored between 1957 and 2003. Up-thrusting of the peatland surface due to permafrost aggradation during the Little Ice Age resulted in the formation of an extensive peat plateau that gradually fragmented into residual palsas from the 19th century to the present. Only about 18% of the original surface occupied by permafrost was thawed in 1957, whereas only 13% was still surviving in 2003. Rapid permafrost melting over the last 50 years caused the concurrent formation of thermokarst ponds and fen-bog vegetation with rapid peat accumulation through natural successional processes of terrestrialization. The main climatic driver for accelerated permafrost thawing was snow precipitation which increased from 1957 to present while annual and seasonal temperatures remained relatively stable until about the mid-1990s when annual temperature rose well above the mean. Contrary to current expectations, the melting of permafrost caused by recent climate change does not transform the peatland to a carbon-source ecosystem as rapid terrestrialization exacerbates carbon-sink conditions and tends to balance the local carbon budget.

AB Assessment of the degree of decay of peat (humification) in ombrotrophic mires has become a standard technique for palaeoclimatic reconstruction, based on the finding that decay is primarily determined by surface wetness and temperature at the time of peat deposition. Determination of humification is undertaken by colorimetric measurement of an alkali extract of the peat at 540 nm. Humification is proportional to the amount of humic matter dissolved by this extraction process, although few researchers convert results to a quantitative measure of humification expressing results as percentage light transmission through the peat. This paper uses luminescence spectroscopy to assess the chemical composition of these extracts. Luminescence excitation and emission wavelengths suggest that high molecular weight acids ('humic acids') are altered by the extraction procedure to form lower molecular weight acids ('fulvic acids'), amino acids and polysaccharides. Percentage transmission is principally related to luminescence emission wavelength and thus to molecular weight of the compounds present. Luminescence emission shows much more sensitivity to peat composition and demonstrates that different plant species may be affected to different degrees by the NaOH extraction process. The findings broadly support the underlying principle of colorimetric determination of 'humification' whereby transmission levels decrease with increasing plant breakdown, but show that it is based on an inadequate understanding of the chemical processes occurring in peat decay and preparation procedures. Luminescence spectroscopy provides a technique for resolving these issues.

AB Peatlands are a major terrestrial carbon store and a persistent natural carbon sink during the Holocene, but there is considerable uncertainty over the fate of peatland carbon in a changing climate. It is generally assumed that higher temperatures will increase peat decay, causing a positive feedback to climate warming and contributing to the global positive carbon cycle feedback. Here we use a new extensive database of peat profiles across northern high latitudes to examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation over the past millennium. Opposite to expectations, our results indicate a small negative carbon cycle feedback from past changes in the long-term accumulation rates of northern peatlands. Total carbon accumulated over the last 1000 yr is linearly related to contemporary growing season length and photosynthetically active radiation, suggesting that variability in net primary productivity is more important than decomposition in determining long-term carbon accumulation. Furthermore, northern peatland carbon sequestration rate declined over the climate transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA), probably because of lower LIA temperatures combined with increased cloudiness suppressing net primary productivity. Other factors including changing moisture status, peatland distribution, fire, nitrogen deposition, permafrost thaw and methane emissions will also influence future peatland carbon cycle feedbacks, but our data suggest that the carbon sequestration rate could increase over many areas of northern peatlands in a warmer future.

AB In southern Sweden there are regional gradients in the rate of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, and the rate of N deposition has increased in recent decades. This may have caused a shift in the growth-limiting nutrient of Sphagnum growth from nitrogen to phosphorus. In this study, the influence of N and P concentrations on the decay of litter peat formed by Sphagnum magellanicum was examined. A total of 90 litter peat samples formed by this species was collected from 15 raised bags (3 sites per bog; 2 microsites per site). Total N and P of samples were determined and the rate of decomposition (CO2 release) was measured under aerated, laboratory conditions at 18 degrees C. Differences in decomposition rates, N and P concentrations were most pronounced among microsites within sites, whereas no significant differences were observed among bogs. The results indicate that decomposition of S. magellanicum litter peat is influenced more by P than by N. Thus, it appears that the recent increase in atmospheric N deposition has not had a large direct effect on peat decomposition rates. It is suggested that the efficient uptake of N and P by the Sphagnum plant may lead to a positive feedback mechanism, whereby more slowly growing Sphagnum produces more nutrient-enriched litter peat with a more rapid decay. Such a mechanism could promote the development of microtopography (hummocks and hollows) on bogs.

AB This article reviews the existing conceptual and simulation models for peatlands and develops a model framework for simulating peatland dynamics in boreal regions. Clymo's peat bog growth model has been used as the conceptual foundation in published simulation models, but in these models the structural and functional layers of litter, acrotelm and catotelm are not dynamically integrated. Organic-matter decomposition processes in these layers operate at different rates over various time scales. The processes in more active litter and acrotelm layers largely pre-determine the net peat accumulation in the catotelm. On the basis of evaluating litter and peat-core data, we propose a model design that connects different layers through changing water-table depth, driven by effective moisture. The model framework includes single and double negative exponential decay functions that together produce net peat accumulation or degradation and hence carbon balance. The model is designed to be generic in structure, but can be validated using estimated parameters and observed peat accumulation data for continental western Canada. The objectives of this model exercise are (1) to understand the interactions of different biological and environmental factors in boreal peatlands, and (2) to realistically simulate peat accumulation and decay over the last several millennia using proxy paleoclimate data as drivers and peat profiles for validation.

AB We used habitat suitability modeling to investigate whether the 15% ecosystem restoration target set in the previous Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) and EU Biodiversity strategy targets, is sufficient to safeguard red-listed mire plant species. We assessed six theoretical restoration scenarios for drained peatland landscapes by altering the proportion of drained and undrained peatland area in 25-ha grid cells. The proportions represented steps when 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 75% and 100% of the drained peatland is restored. We modelled the habitat suitability for 48 red-listed plant species in the aapa mire region in boreal Finland. Model outcomes were assessed at the level of five species groups: calcareous species, rich fen species, decaying wood species, mesotrophic fen species, and spruce swamp species. The predicted distribution increased for 34 (71%) of the 48 red listed plant species when 15% of drained peatland area was predicted to be restored. At the same time the potentially occupied area of species increased by 9%. In the scenario where all peatlands were restored, the predicted distribution of 43 (90%) of species increased, and on average the distribution of species quadrupled. According to our predictions, meeting the 15% ecosystem restoration target, set in the previous CBD and EU Biodiversity strategy targets would be beneficial for most of the boreal red-listed mire plant species, but a larger restoration area would expand their distribution considerably more. Our study shows that a landscape level approach is important to assess thresholds for the potential biodiversity benefits arising from peatland restoration. The models can also be used to select suitable areas for restoration. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Peatlands in the Snowy Mountains cover nearly 8000 ha and preserve 49 million m(3) of peat, of which 27.1 million m3 is stored in Sphagnum shrublands and restiad moorlands and 21.9 million m(3) is stored in sedge fen. The total carbon store is estimated to be about 3.55 Tg. Peat accumulation over the past 60 years indicates that the historical carbon accumulation rate is only 4950 Mg yr(-1) for the entire peat estate. This equates to net carbon storage rates of 0.8-1.6 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) which is similar to the rates of 0.2 to 2.3 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) found in other temperate peatlands. Peat sections covering the last 3000 to 4000 years, however, retain a millennial-scale net long-term storage of 0.09 to 0.21 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) totalling 2340 Mg yr(-1). The lower storage value of the older peats is partly due to continuing slow peat decay but may also represent accelerated decay due to disturbance by a 100-year phase of stock grazing and intentional burning in the mountains. Some peatlands are recovering strongly since grazing was stopped but they are still vulnerable to hydrological changes caused by trampling by large mammals. Rates of carbon sequestration will be sensitive to climate change, as the peatlands are already stressed by these former land management practices and many are at their climatic limits. The active management of peatland hydrology and surface stabilisation is essential to peatland recovery and the conservation of these significant carbon stores.

AB Peatland rewetting aims at stopping the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and establishing net carbon sinks. However, in times of global warming, restoration projects must increasingly deal with extreme events such as drought periods. Here, we evaluate the effect of the European summer drought 2018 on vegetation development and the exchange of methane (CH4) and CO(2)in two rewetted minerotrophic fens (Hutelmoor-Hte and Zarnekow-Zrk) including potential carry-over effects in the post-drought year. Drought was a major stress factor for the established vegetation but also promoted the rapid spread of new vegetation, which will likely gain a lasting foothold in Zrk. Accordingly, drought increased not only respiratory CO(2)losses but also photosynthetic CO(2)uptake. Altogether, the drought reduced the net CO(2)sink in Hte, while it stopped the persistent net CO(2)emissions of Zrk. In addition, the drought reduced CH(4)emissions in both fens, though this became most apparent in the post-drought year and suggests a lasting shift towards non-methanogenic organic matter decomposition. Occasional droughts can be beneficial for the restoration of the peatland carbon sink function if the newly grown vegetation increases CO(2)sequestration in the long term. Nonetheless, care must be taken to prevent extensive peat decay. This article is part of the theme issue 'Impacts of the 2018 severe drought and heatwave in Europe: from site to continental scale'.

AB This study focuses on comparing the driving ecological factors and community diversity of fen vegetation from the plain part of the South Ural region with those of the mountain fen vegetation, previously described by us (Ivchenko and Znamenskiy Russian Journal of Ecology 47:453-459, 2016), by means of vegetation data clustering and gradient analysis. The indicator values by several authors (H Ellenberg, E Landolt, LG Ramensky, DN Tsyganov) and WorldClim bioclimatic variables were used to determine the ecological meaning of the gradients. We found that the main gradient for both plain and mountain fen vegetation is the poor-rich fen gradient, which depends on local substrate chemical composition. The second gradient is associated with moisture, which tends to increase consistently both from mountains towards plains and across plains from peneplain towards West Siberian Lowland. The moisture gradient proved to be unrelated to precipitation, which increase linearly from plains towards mountains. The community diversity in the mountain part is higher than in the plain part. The fen vegetation of plains and mountains overlap in ordination space but a half of the types described for mountain fen vegetation do not occur on plains, while two types of plain fen vegetation from the West Siberian Lowland are absent on mountains.

AB We used moss increment counting to obtain well-defined samples of the topmost peat layers of two Sphagnum fuscum hummocks. The two ombrotrophic bogs, Lakkasuo in central Finland and Korvinsuo in eastern Finland, are of different ages, covering 3 and 9 ka, respectively. Using AMS dating, we traced bomb-produced C-14 through the topmost parts of the two peat profiles. A well-defined C-14 activity peak was found in both sequences dating the corresponding layer to AD 1965. A comparison between the maximum peat activities and the corresponding atmospheric values for the period of interest provides an opportunity to evaluate the amount of CO2 emanating from the decaying peat bog, and taken up by the living sphagnum plants.
   Considerable variations in delta(13)C values were also observed. These variations indicate, at least partly, annual variations in the emission rate of CO2 from decomposition of older peat in the bog, and are connected with climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation.

AB Raised bogs are important ecohydrological systems in which there are strong two-way links between plant succession, litter and peat decay, and hydrological functioning. Using recently established protocols, we measured the hydraulic structure of a raised bog in West Wales. We tested two hypotheses: (i) that the hydraulic conductivity (K) of the peat shows depth dependency such that lower layers of peat are effectively impermeable, and (ii) that the K of the marginal peat of the bog dome is lower than that in central areas. From 107 piezometer measurements we found there was depth dependency of K but that lower peat layers were not poorly permeable or impermeable. We also found that the K of the peat on the margin of the bog dome was generally significantly lower than that in central areas. Our results Suggest that, for some bogs at least. it is important to simulate water flow through deeper peats when simulating peatland development or growth. They also raise the intriguing possibility that the low K of marginal peat is important in maintaining wet conditions in central bog areas, allowing bogs to reach greater thicknesses than they would do in the absence of the low-K margin; an idea first proposed for blanket bogs by Lapen et al. (2005). Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We studied twelve late Holocene organic deposits in West-Frisia, The Netherlands. Pollen, spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, mosses, other botanical macrofossils and insect remains were recorded for reconstructions of changing environmental conditions. Eastern West-Frisia was a cultivated landscape during the Bronze Age, but it became a freshwater wetland in the Late Bronze Age. In most of our sites, radiocarbon dates show that time transgressive inundation of soils preceded the climate shift at 850 cal BC for several centuries. We suggest that solar forcing of climate change may have delivered the final push to the inundation and depopulation of West-Frisia, which had already commenced several centuries before, due to sealevel rise. We did not find evidence for significant Bronze Age tree growth in West-Frisia before the inundations. Vegetation successions in the new wetlands developed from shallow mineral-rich freshwater to rich-fen vegetation. Subsequently poor fen vegetation with birch and pine developed, and the natural succession led to ombrotrophic raised bog vegetation. Complete successions from shallow, mineral-rich lakes to raised bog lasted between 1000 and 1500 calendar years. We hypothesize that medieval drainage and reclamation became possible only when the mires of West-Frisia had reached the raised bog stage. Reclamation of raised bogs by medieval farmers (drainage, eutrophication, peat digging) caused compaction, oxidation and loss of the upper part of the peat deposit. Seeds of salt-tolerant and salt-demanding plant species indicate that the medieval sites were inundated during storm surges with brackish or salt water, which triggered the farmers to build artificial mounds and, later, dikes. Under mounds and dikes, peat deposits remained protected against further decay. With our data we deliver a long-term perspective on contemporary ecosystem dynamics of freshwater wetlands, relevant for nature conservation and future climate change.

AB Northern mires (fens and bogs) have significant climate feedbacks and contribute to biodiversity, providing habitats to specialized biota. Many studies have found drying and degradation of bogs in response to climate change, while northern fens have received less attention. Rich fens are particularly important to biodiversity, but subject to global climate change, fen ecosystems may change via direct response of vegetation or indirectly by hydrological changes. With repeated sampling over the past 20 years, we aim to reveal trends in hydrology and vegetation in a pristine boreal fen with gradient from rich to poor fen and bog vegetation. We resampled 203 semi-permanent plots and compared water-table depth (WTD), pH, concentrations of mineral elements, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), plant species occurrences, community structure, and vegetation types between 1998 and 2018. In the study area, the annual mean temperature rose by 1.0 degrees C and precipitation by 46 mm, in 20-year periods prior to sampling occasions. We found that wet fen vegetation decreased, while bog and poor fen vegetation increased significantly. This reflected a trend of increasing abundance of common, generalist hummock species at the expense of fen specialist species. Changes were the most pronounced in high pH plots, where Sphagnum mosses had significantly increased in plot frequency, cover, and species richness. Changes of water chemistry were mainly insignificant in concentration levels and spatial patterns. Although indications toward drier conditions were found in vegetation, WTD had not consistently increased, instead, our results revealed complex dynamics of WTD as depending on vegetation changes. Overall, we found significant trend in vegetation, conforming to common succession pattern from rich to poor fen and bog vegetation. Our results suggest that responses intrinsic to vegetation, such as increased productivity or altered species interactions, may be more significant than indirect effects via local hydrology to the ecosystem response to climate warming.

AB The aim of this study was to identify the differences in the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil dependent on both land use and soil depth. Soil solutions of six differently used sites in a German fen area were sampled using ceramic suction cups at three depths (25, 55 and 95 cm) and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over a 2 1/2-year period. Studies on DOM composition included UV and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as a fractionation in hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. The DOC concentration was affected by land use in topsoil only. Degraded peatlands had a high intensity of land use and therefore a low soil carbon content and low DOC concentrations. The DOC concentrations decreased significantly with increasing soil depth. The DOM retention through adsorption or decomposition was much higher at intact peatlands than at degraded peatlands. The degraded peatlands soil DOM had a higher specific absorption at 285 nm and a higher humification index derived from fluorescence spectra than DOM of intact peatlands (low intensity of land use) down to the subsoil. The higher DOM humification was related to strong peat decay. The DOM of degraded peatlands preserved its higher degree of aromaticity and polycondensation down to the subsoil, although highly condensed and substituted aromatic compounds were retained preferentially with increasing soil depth. Therefore, effects of land use on the soil DOM composition are stronger than the effects dependent on increasing soil depth. The DOM fractionation in hydrophobic and hydrophilic components was not sensitive enough to detect the small differences in DOM composition caused by land use and depth.

AB In 1958, 85% of the peat-bog complex Kyselovsky les, in the Czech Republic, was flooded with water from the Lipno reservoir. A new vegetation pattern has spontaneously developed in the newly established shoreline and replaced the original peat-bog vegetation dominated by bog pine (Pious rotundata Link) forest. This vegetation pattern consists of zonal strips with relatively sharp borders. This zonation is a mosaic of sedge fens, reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) beds. tussock cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum L.) stands, and a community dominated by ericaceous shrubs. The study focused on the vegetation development of this zonal vegetation. Measurements of the water table level. groundwater pH, and conductivity. together with terrain microtopography, were done to estimate the ways in which the water reservoir influences the mire vegetation. The most important factor is lake water fluctuation, which explained most of the vegetation gradient variability. Lake water fluctuations were represented by lake water levels. which directly flooded a certain part of the gradient from 1990 to 2006 for a known number of days.

ID FINLAND; TRANSPORTATION; CARBON
AB New raw materials for transportation fuels need to be introduced, in order to fight against climate change and also to cope with increasing risks of availability and price of oil. Peat has been recognised suitable raw material option for diesel produced by gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The energy content of Finnish peat reserves is remarkable. In this study, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel production and utilisation in Finland was assessed from the life-cycle point of view. In 100 year's time horizon the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel is likely larger than the impact of fossil diesel. The impact can somewhat be lowered by producing peat from the agricultural peatland (strong greenhouse gas emissions from the decaying peatlayer are avoided) with new peat production technique, and utilising the produced biomass from the after-treatment area for diesel also. if diesel production is integrated with pulp and paper mill to achieve energy efficiency benefits and if the electricity demand can be covered by zero emission electricity, the greenhouse impact of peat-based FT diesel reduces to the level of fossil diesel when agricultural peatland is used, and is somewhat higher when forestry-drained peatland is used as raw material source.

AB Peat chemistry appears to exert primary control over methane production rates in the Canadian Northern Wetlands Study (NOWES) area. We determined laboratory methane production rate potentials in anaerobic slurries of samples collected from a transect of sites through the NOWES study area. We related methane production rates to indicators of resistance to microbial decay (peat C:N and lignin:N ratios) and experimentally manipulated substrate availability for methanogenesis using ethanol (EtOH) and plant litter. We also determined responses of methane production to pH and temperature. Methane production potentials declined along the gradient of sites from high rates in the coastal fens to low rates in the interior bogs and were generally highest in surface layers. Strong relationships between CH4 production potentials and pest chemistry suggested that methanogenesis was limited by fermentation rates. Methane production at ambient pH responded strongly to substrate additions in the circumneutral fens with narrow lignin:N and C:N ratios (partial derivative CH4/partial derivative EtOH = 0.9-2.3mg g(-1)) and weakly in the acidic bogs with wide C:N and lignin:N ratios (partial derivative CH4/partial derivative EtOH = -0.04-0.02 mg g(-1)). Observed Q(10) values ranged from 1.7 to 4.7 and generally increased with increasing substrate availability, suggesting that fermentation rates were limiting. Titration experiments generally demonstrated inhibition of methanogenesis by low pH. Our results suggest that the low rates of methane emission observed in interior bogs during NOWES likely resulted from pH and substrate quality limitation of the fermentation step in methane production and thus reflect intrinsically low methane production potentials. Low methane emission rates observed during NOWES will likely be observed in other northern wetland regions with similar vegetation chemistry.

AB Fens are widely distributed wetlands worldwide and provide vital habitat for plant and animal species in mountainous regions. Alpine fens are rare in the Rocky Mountains and concentrated in the San Juan Mountains where broad regions at high elevation have relatively level topography and suitable climate to favor peat accumulation. Studies of montane and boreal peatlands have identified water chemistry as a main driver of vegetation composition. This study investigated whether similar drivers of vegetation composition are important for alpine and subalpine fens in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, USA. Water chemistry variables were most important in structuring subalpine and alpine fen vegetation. However, these variables explained considerably less variation in alpine than subalpine fen vegetation. In addition, lower variance of water chemistry in alpine fens did not lead to lower beta diversity of vegetation in alpine than in subalpine fens. Although alpine and subalpine fen vegetation supports similar beta diversity, key differences occur in the environmental drivers of their vegetation composition.

AB Patagonian peatland ecosystems have received very little attention in the scientific literature despite their widespread distribution in the regional landscape and the anthropogenic pressure they experience from the peat extraction industry. The functioning of these southern peatlands is strikingly similar to that of northern peatlands, but they have developed under very different climate boundary conditions. Therefore, studying these ecosystems provides a unique opportunity to test ideas and hypotheses about the sensitivity of carbon-rich peat accumulating ecosystems to climate change, in addition to filling significant data and knowledge gaps. Here we provide a synthesis of detailed peat accumulation records for southern Patagonia using a combination of new peat-core analysis (from 4 sites) and a data review from previously published studies (from 19 sites). We also present the modern climate space (temperature, precipitation, and seasonality ranges) of Patagonian peatlands on the basis of modern peatland distribution and gridded climate data to discuss climate controls of Patagonian peatlands at the present and in the past by inference. Results indicated that Patagonian peatlands occupy a distinct climatological niche that corresponds to an end-member of the northern peatland climate domain, with a mild mean annual temperature (from 3 to 9 degrees C) and very weak temperature seasonality. We also found that Patagonian peatlands have been efficient land carbon sinks since their initiation, with a mean soil carbon density of 168 kg C m(-2) +/- 10%. The total carbon pool for these ecosystems was estimated at 7.6 GtC. Modeled peat addition rates to the catotelm in Patagonian peatlands were significantly higher than what has been reported for northern peatlands, but decay coefficients were similar between these two high-latitude regions. These results support the idea that long, mild growing seasons promote peat formation in southern Patagonia. At the regional scale however, the lack of correlation between climatic parameters and peat accumulation indices suggests that autogenic controlling factors might be at play. Overall, southern peatlands provide a unique opportunity for studying peatland-carbon-climate linkages under a new set of climatic conditions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To assess whether short-term changes in mire vegetation can be detected using the phytosociological approach, paired vegetation relev,s from two surveys of 112 mire sites of Switzerland were assigned to phytosociological alliances through a numerical approach. About 30% of the plots were assigned to different alliances in the two surveys. These transitions were analysed based on species frequencies and interpreted ecologically using Landolt's indicator values. Transitions between different alliances were more frequently related to the appearance of new species rather than to the disappearance of species. Transitions from and to peat bog communities were frequent. Many plots with fen vegetation were transformed into other wetland types. Fen-grassland increased in abundance, mainly at the cost of small-sedge fens. To re-establish the function of the Swiss mires as peat producers, we recommend to raise the mean summer water table to a maximum depth of 10 cm.

AB We investigated the effect of increased N-supply on productivity and potential litter decay rates of Carex species, which are the dominant vascular plant species in peatlands in the Netherlands. We hypothesized that: (1) under conditions of N-limited plant growth, increased N-supply will lead to increased productivity but will not affect C:N ratios of plant litter and potential decay rates of that litter; and (2) under conditions of P-limited plant growth, increased N-supply will not affect productivity but it will lead to lower C:N ratios in plant litter and thereby to a higher potential decay rate of that litter. These hypotheses were tested by fertilization experiments (addition of 10 g N m(-2) year(-1)) in peatlands in which plant growth was N-limited and P-limited, respectively. We investigated the effects of fertilization on net C-fixation by plant biomass, N uptake, leaf litter chemistry and potential leaf litter decay. In a P-limited peatland, dominated by Carex lasiocarpa, there was no significant increase of net C-fixation by plant biomass upon enhanced N-supply, although N-uptake had increased significantly compared with the unfertilized control. Due to the N-fertilization the C:N ratio in the plant biomass decreased significantly. Similarly, the C:N ratio of leaf litter produced at the end of the experiment showed a significant decrease upon enhanced N-supply. The potential decay rate of that litter, measured as CO2-evolution from the litter under aerobic conditions, was significantly increased upon enhanced N-supply. In a N-limited peatland, dominated by C. acutiformis, the net C-fixation by plant biomass increased with increasing N-supply, whereas the increase in N-uptake was not significant. The C:N ratio of both living plant material and of dead leaves did not change in response to N-fertilization. The potential decay rate of the leaf litter was not affected by N-supply. The results agree with our hypotheses. This implies that atmospheric N-deposition may affect the CO2-sink function of peatlands, but the effect is dependent on the nature of nutrient limitation. In peatlands where plant growth is N-limited, increased N-supply leads to an increase in the net accumulation of C. Under conditions of P-limited plant growth, however, the net C-accumulation will decrease, because productivity is not further increased, whereas the amount of C lost through decomposition of dead organic matter is increased. As plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems is N-limited, increased N-supply will in most peatlands lead to an increase of net C-accumulation.

ID BROADLAND; NORFOLK
AB (1) Relationships between vegetation composition and nutrient and major ion concentrations in groundwater and peat were examined in 58 stands of fen vegetation in the Biebrza mire, Poland.  The 58 stands included rich fens with a large standing biomass, rich fens with lower standing biomass and poor fens.
   (2) The highly productive rich fen (i.e. rich fen with large standing biomass) receives moderately eutrophic river water.  The rheophilous part of the mire that is not, or only occasionally flooded contains gradients from quite productive rich fens to less productive rich fens and poor fens.  In this part of the gradient, occasional river flooding appeared to be an important source of K and was probably responsible for the presence of quite productive rich fen vegetation.
   (3) Upward seepage of calcium-rich and phosphate-poor groundwater keeps phosphate concentration low in the superficial mire water and the peat from the lower productive rich fen.  Phosphate concentration is higher in the mire water and the peat from the poor fen which is fed by downward-flowing rainwater.
   (4) Nitrogen concentration in mire water and peat is only poorly correlated with species composition and vegetation structure.

AB Most rich-fen bryophyte species are currently declining and red listed in many European countries. Little is known about their past and current occurrence. We investigated past and recent bryophyte assemblages in mires in the land uplift coast of Finland. The study areas included primary succession areas where mire development started c. 6000 BP. In total, seven mires were studied in two successional transects along the land uplift coast. The past occurrences of rich-fen and other bryophytes were studied in 45 mire stratigraphic peat profiles, and recent occurrences were collected from 158 vegetation plots of 10mx10m. Bryophyte subfossils indicated that the central parts of the basins developed first to wet rich fens with groundwater influence, which developed towards intermediate fens or poorer mire types. Most mire bryophytes occurred in about the same proportion in peat profiles as in recent vegetation. Five rich-fen species (Hamatocaulis lapponicus, H. vernicosus, Meesia longiseta, M. triquetra and Pseudocalliergon trifarium) were clearly more common in peat profiles than in the present mire vegetation, where these species were very rare and appeared only in small patches without sporophytes. These rich-fen species have had markedly wider distributions in the past, probably linked to climate fluctuations, whereas current occurrences are becoming scarce because of multiple anthropogenic factors such mire drainage and climate change.

AB Recent findings have indicated that the carbon density and store in peat soil may increase after drainage for forestry, even if soil respiration has clearly increased. This is caused by the increased organic C flow from tree stands into soil and consequent retention in the pear matrix. Relocation of C-14-activity released from the labelled needle and fine root litter during 4- and 8-month incubation experiments showed that, on average, only 60-80% of the activity lost from litter was emitted to the atmosphere. The proportion retained in the moss layer was from 7 to 14%, in the pear soil from 7 to 18% and in the water percolated through the peat from < 1 to 8%. The results thus support the hypothesis that organic C flow may contribute to C storage in drained peat soils. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Norwegian and Russian Arctic
   marine sediments: concentrations, geographical distribution and sources
SO NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SEA; GEOCHEMISTRY
AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contaminants of concern under the Arctic Environmental Monitoring Programme (AMAP) due to their carcinogenic potential. The concentration of the different PAH components may be connected to the geochemical background of the sediments, including leakage and erosion of fossil carbon, as well as epigenetic processes such as decaying peat. In other cases there is a human influence connected to petroleum spills or combustion of fossil fuel or other human activities. The overall goal of this study was to identify and analyze existing comparable datasets on PAHs From Norwegian and Russian arctic shelves, and use the concentration and composition of PAH components in the selected datasets to assess baseline concentration of PAH, geographical anomalies and sources and routes of transport, as well as the human impact. PAHs in 330 samples of surface sediment from the Barents and Kara Sea shelves, collected during the period 1991-1998, have been selected for the study.
   In the Southwest Barents Sea the nature of PAHs is formed by a complex sedimentation regime made up of inflowing Atlantic and North Sea water, coastal discharges, coastal abrasion and atmospheric transport. The PAHs basically correspond to background compositions with a low but notable anthropogenic influence. In the Northern Barents Sea both concentration and composition of PAHs are genetically (genesis, conditions and level of transformation) connected with eroded sediment material from the Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land archipelagos. The relative high PAH levels observed off Spitsbergen thus generally may have a non-anthropogenic explanation. In the central part of the Barents Sea the PAH levels in the deep-water bottom sediments are generally low, non-anthropogenic in origin, and determined by endogenous processes. Erosion and re-deposition of Novaya Zemlya strata do not have a significant influence on PAH composition in this part of the Barents Sea. In the Southeast Barents Sea (Pechora Sea) the PAH composition corresponds, in general, well with the PAH allocation in the Barents Sea. However, the terrigenous influence is stronger. The PAH composition exhibits both epigenetic processes (such as the high level of perylene which most probably is derived from decaying peat) and the presence of petrogenic PAH. The latter findings may be due to the influx of rivers draining oil-rich onshore territories. In estuaries and offshore the Kara Sea the PAH composition of bottom sediments reflects the significant influence of river run-off (with the same patterns as in the Pechora Sea), but also atmospheric transport of combustion derived PAHs, most probably from the smelters in Norilsk.

AB Mire vegetation of the Muranska planina Mts and adjacent parts of neighbouring orographical units was studied in 1998-2005 using the standard Zurich-Montpellier (Braun-Blanquet) approach. We applied the defined phytosociological species groups and national formal definitions of mire associations in data processing. Within the classes Scheuchzerio-Caricetea fuscae and Oxycocco-Sphagnetea, seven associations (Caricetum davallianae, Carici flavae-Cratoneuretum filicini, Valeriano simplicifoliae-Caricetum flavae, Caricetum goodenowii, Carici echinatae-Sphagnetum, Carici rostratae-Sphagnetum and Pino mugo-Sphagnetum) were classified using formal classification criteria. Two other communities (Sphagno warnstorfii-Caricetum davallianae and Eriophoro vaginati-Sphagnetum recurvi) were not classified due to the lack of sufficient number of diagnostic species from species groups. The first DCA axis followed the mineral richness gradient. Vegetation plots were arranged from rich fens over moderately rich fens towards poor Sphagnum fens and raised bog. This fact was confirmed by a strong and significant correlation of the DCA site scores on the first axis with the measured pH and water conductivity as a surrogate of mineral richness. The second DCA axis correlated with mean Ellenberg's indicator values for both temperature and soil nutrients. This pattern corresponds to that found in other regions of diversified Central-European landscape. We can therefore conclude that marginal geographical position and climatic specifity of the region under study did not alter gradient structure of the mire vegetation. When diversity of mire vegetation was compared to other regions in Slovakia by applying the same formal definitions to different regions, the study region was found to be conspicuously less diverse than the distribution centres of mire habitats in Slovakia (Orava and Vysoke Tatry regions), but more diverse than most of other marginal regions of mire distribution. Relatively high beta diversity of mires was probably caused by variable bedrock and local climate.

AB Aim The formation of a local vegetation mosaic may be attributed to local variation in abiotic environmental conditions. Recent research, however, indicates that self-facilitating organisms and negative species interactions may be a driving factor. In this study, we explore whether heterogeneous geohydrological conditions or vegetation feedbacks and interactions could be responsible for a vegetation mosaic of rich and poor fen species.
   Location Lake Aturtaun, Roundstone Bog, Ireland.
   Methods In a floating fen, transects were set out to analyze the relation between vegetation type and rock-peat distance and porewater electrical conductivity. Furthermore, three distinct vegetation types were studied: rich fen, poor fen and patches of poor fen within rich fen vegetation. Biogeochemical measurements were conducted in a vertical profile to distinguish abiotic conditions of distinct vegetation types.
   Results Geohydrological conditions may drive the distribution of poor and rich fen species at a larger scale in the floating fen, due to the supply of minerotrophic groundwater. Interestingly, both rich and poor fen vegetation occurred in a mosaic, when electrical conductivity values at 50 cm depth were between 300 mu S/cm and 450 mu S/cm. Although environmental conditions were homogeneous at 50 cm, they differed markedly between rich and poor fen vegetation at 10 cm depth. Specifically, our measurements indicate that poor fen vegetation lowered porewater alkalinity, bicarbonate concentrations and pH. No effects of rich fen vegetation at 10 cm depth on biogeochemistry was measured. However, rich fen litter had a higher mineralization rate than poor fen litter, which increases the influence of minerotrophic water in rich fen habitat.
   Conclusions These results strengthen our hypothesis that species can drive formation of vegetation mosaics under environmentally homogeneous conditions in a floating fen. Positive intraspecific self-facilitating mechanisms and negative species interactions could be responsible for a stable coexistence of species, even leading to local ecosystem engineering by the species, explaining the local vegetation mosaic at the microscale level in a floating fen.

AB In the short term, discontinuation of mouldboard ploughing (MP) in clay soils may cause yield decrease because of coarse seedbed and poor crop establishment. This study evaluated the role of partly decayed peat in improving soil properties at the soil surface during the transition to conservation tillage. Moderately decomposed peat was spread on the soil surface (0.02 m, 50% of field area). Since 1995, the field was either (1) tilled each September with a mouldboard plough, (2) tilled each September with a field cultivator, or (3) not primary tilled (NT). Oat (1996, 1998, 2000) and barley (1997, 1999) were sown in May, after a shallow secondary tillage. Discontinuation of MP created a coarser seedbed with subsequent yield reductions. Peat delayed the drying of the soil surface in early seasons. Plant growth was enhanced even 5 years after the application. Peat did not, however, significantly improve the aggregate stability of this clay soil in 1996-1998. Within 1 year after application, peat and/or MP increased risk for N leaching. Overall, mineral N contents were low in all the tillage practices, with or without peat application. This appeared to be a response to a low N fertilisation rate (90 kg ha(-1)) and sufficiently high soil C/N. Mineral N contents after harvest were related to previous plant growth and N uptake. Peat application offers a means to minimise the risk of poor growth, and hence nutrient leaching. Peat did not, however, improve aggregate size distribution after the tillage change.

AB Conioscinella zetterstedti Andersson, a Palaearctic chloropid fly with polymorphic wing reduction, is recorded for the first time from the Nearctic region. The known range of the species is also expanded in the Palaearctic region, with records from the Novosibirsk region of Russia. The male and female terminalia are described and illustrated. Although previously known only from supralittoral areas on the shores of the North and Baltic seas, collection data in the Nearctic and central Palaearctic regions indicate that C. zetterstedti may be abundant in various decay communities including peatlands, swamps, lake shore debris, mammal nests, forest leaf litter, and around the bases of vegetation.

AB The lagg of ombrotrophic peatland studied is the ecotone connecting two contrasting in respect of trophic conditions ecosystems: acidic bog and fertilized arable fields. Differences of element content in the waters of these habitats concerns the concentration of Ca, Mg, Na, Cl and pH value: The periodical inflow of waters from agriculture catchment alkalize this zone and, as a result, threaten the ecological system of bog, what is realized by increasing lagg area at the cost of bog area and by decay of ombrotrophic flora components.

AB We determined evapotranspiration in three experiments designed to study the effects of elevated CO2 and increased N deposition on ombrotrophic bog vegetation. Two experiments used peat monoliths with intact bog vegetation in containers, with one experiment outdoors and the other in a greenhouse. A third experiment involved monocultures and mixtures of Sphagnum magellanicum and Eriophorum angustifolium in containers in the same greenhouse. To determine water use of the bog vegetation in July-August for each experiment and each year we measured water inputs and outputs from the containers. We studied the effects of elevated CO2 and N supply on evapotranspiration in relation to vascular plant biomass and exposure of the moss surface (measured as height of the moss surface relative to the container edge).
   Elevated CO2 reduced water use of the bog vegetation in all three experiments, but the CO2 effect on evapotranspiration interacted with vascular plant biomass and exposure of the moss surface. Evapotranspiration in the outdoor experiment was largely determined by evaporation from the Sphagnum moss surface (as affected by exposure to wind) and less so by vascular plant transpiration. Nevertheless, elevated CO2 significantly reduced evapotranspiration by 9-10% in the outdoor experiment.
   Vascular plants reduced evapotranspiration in the outdoor experiment, but increased water use in the greenhouse experiments. The relation between vascular plant abundance and evapotranspiration appears to depend on wind conditions; suggesting that vascular plants reduce water losses mainly by reducing wind speed at the moss surface.
   Sphagnum growth is very sensitive to changes in water level; low water availability can have deleterious effects. As a consequence, reduced evapotranspiration in summer, whether caused by elevated CO2 or by small increases in vascular plant cover, is expected to favour Sphagnum growth in ombrotrophic bog vegetation.

AB The combined autecology of individual species is expected to reflect the synecology of their respective functional groups and vice versa, but this assumption has been rarely assessed. We estimated this similarity in limiting ecological filters using vegetation survey data from 64 abandoned extracted peatlands in Estonia, which form a 50-year chronosequence of secondary succession. Partial overlap was found between filters predicting the occurrence of individual core species and richness in their respective functional groups. These overlapping filters were microtopographical form (flats, margins, ditches), time since abandonment, and various properties of peat. At the functional group level, time since abandonment and habitat properties showed clear interactions with microform type. Bog species and acidophilous bilocals successfully established on flats and ditch margins when residual peat was acidic and poorly decayed, while species of fens and mineral soils preferentially established in ditches of large extraction fields, where residual peat had higher pH and higher mineral content. We also detected some effects of landscape-level (patch area and forest neighbourhood) and regional filters (continentality); however, their limiting role was inconsistent. Many ecological filters also were shared between functional groups at the species level, but the optimal levels of these filters differed between groups. We conclude that even in species-poor habitats, both the autecology of individual species and the synecology of functional groups should be considered during habitat restoration. In peatland restoration, the following management strategies are advised to direct a faster and more successful trajectory: controlling the depth of peat extraction, partial filling of ditches, introducing plant propagules and managing mineral dust pollution.

AB A national land use inventory program was used to estimate the flux of methane from Swedish mires. During the snow-free season in 1994, methane fluxes were monitored at 60% (n = 619) of the total number of permanent inventory plots for the four mire vegetation classes included. The methane flux was measured only once at each inventory plot using transparent static chambers, yielding 3157 (89%) accepted flux rates. The temperature during the measurement period was close to the long-term (30 year) average in the north and much warmer in the south. The precipitation was lower than the long-term average. Average flux rates, specific for each mire vegetation class and geographical region, varied between 8 and 238 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). The national averages +/- SE (mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were hummock communities, 24 +/- 6; transitional fens, 15 +/- 2; short sedge fens, 49 +/- 4; and tall sedge fens, 97 +/- 22. To derive the annual flux, the number of days with a daily average air temperature over 5 degreesC was used. The annual methane fluxes for each mire vegetation class and region varied between 1.5 and 40 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1). The annual methane fluxes (average +/- SE in g m(-2) yr(-1)) for each mire vegetation class for the whole of Sweden were hummock sites, 4.9 +/- 1.3; transitional fens, 2.5 +/- 0.5; low sedge fens, 8.2 +/- 0.8; and tall sedge fens, 16.5 +/- 3.6. The methane flux (+/- 95% confidence limits) in 1994 from the monitored mire types in Sweden was 0.29 +/- 0.05 Tg CH4. The low and tall sedge mires accounted for 96% of the methane emitted.

AB Surface water chemistry of two mires was studied in an area with siliceous bedrock and consequently dilute fen waters. Range of variation from moderately rich fen to ombro-trophic bog vegetation was found. Rich fen vegetation was found in Ca concentrations similar to bogs and poor fens, found in many other studies. The poor-rich gradient was related most distinctly to pH, alkalinity, conductivity and the concentrations of Mg and Na. Contrary to the vertical isolation theory of development from fen to bog, in our study the poor-rich gradient was found in an inverse vertical sequence. In the case of weakly buffered waters, downstream spatial succession of water chemistry, including accumulation of organic acidity, is suggested to play a part in the development of the poor-rich gradient. The variation of Al, Fe, Mn and S was found to form a partly independent chemical gradient, related to surface water flow from a podzolic catchment.

   In the mire of la Vraconnaz, located at a mean altitude of 1090 m there was a bog burst in September 1987 after an extraordinary spell of heavy rainfall. The vegetation that was affected by the slide includes various groups of bog plants as well as groups of acidic and alkaline fen plants. Over 6 years the development of this vegetation was monitored on 100 permanent plots. Floristic composition and indicator values were analysed and compared in 1988 and again between 1991 and 1993. Indications of a change in the vegetation pattern are only discernible in the groups of acidic fen vegetation. It may be due to drier conditions, eutrophication and the closing of the herb cover. The stability of the other groups can partly be explained by historical factors. The recolonisation of the bare peat surface progresses slowly and with random settlements at first. Although the slide had been a great disturbance, the observation period was too short to allow the definition of any plant succession patterns.

AB In groundwater-fed fen peatlands, the surface biomass decays rapidly and, as a result, highly humified peat is formed. A high degree of humification constrains palaeoecological studies because reliable identification of plant remains is hampered. Organic geochemistry techniques as a means of identifying historical plant communities have been successfully applied to bog peat. The method has also been applied to fen peat, but without reference to the composition of fen plants. We have applied selected organic geochemistry methods to determine the composition of the neutral lipid fractions from 12 living fen plants, to investigate the potential for the distributions to characterize and separate different fen plants and plant groups. Our results show correspondence with previous studies, e. g. C-23 and C-25 n-alkanes dominating Sphagnum spp. and C-27 to C-31 alkanes dominating vascular plants. However, we also found similarities in n-alkane distributions between Sphagnum spp. and the below ground parts of some vascular plants. We tested the efficiency of different n-alkane ratios to separate species and plant groups. The ratios used for bog studies (e. g. n-C-23/n-C-25 and n-C-23/n-C-29) did not work as consistently for fen plants. Some differences in sterol distribution were found between vascular plants and mosses; in general vascular plants had a higher concentration of sterols. When distributions of n-alkanes, n-alkane ratios and sterols were all included as variables, redundancy analysis (RDA) separated different plant groups into their own clusters. Our results imply that the pattern for bog biomarkers cannot directly be applied to fen environments. Nevertheless, they encourage further testing to determine whether or not the identification of plant groups, plants or plant parts from highly humified peat is possible by applying fen species-specific biomarker proxies.

AB (1) Two peat mounds have developed in the Lost River peatland of northern Minnesota. One has the chemical and physical properties of an extremely rich fen and the other has the properties of a raised bog. The two mounds are separated by a water track with poor-fen vegetation and chemistry.
   (2) The vegetation at Lost River can be divided into five noda that correspond to landform units: spring-fen channel, spring-fen forest, marginal swamp forest, water track, and raised bog. These vegetation types have well-defined ranges for pH and calcium concentration.
   (3) Ordinations of the vascular plant and bryophyte data indicate a close relationship between the vegetation and both moisture and chemical gradients. The link between vegetation and chemistry is also supported by plots of species richness vs. pH and calcium concentration in which the peak in species numbers occurs within the rich-fen range.
   (4) The chemistry of the surface waters at Lost River is largely determined by the mixing of alkaline groundwater with precipitation, because the entire peatland is located at least seasonally within a discharge zone for groundwater. Mixing models indicate that the amount of groundwater within the surface waters ranges from 50% in the spring-fen channels to 1% on the raised bog.
   (5) The development of the two peat mounds was reconstructed from peat cores collected near the crests of the spring-fen mound and raised bog. The raised bog developed over a depression, which was first filled in with fen peat before minerotrophic sphagna invaded the site around 2625 B.P. By 2200 B.P. all fen indicator species had disappeared and the site was dominated by assemblages similar to those in the present raised bog.
   (6) The spring-fen mound, however, developed over a rise in the mineral substrate, which was not covered by peat until 3000 B.P. The mound was quickly colonized by Sphagnum and no fen indicators appeared until 1160 B.P. At this time the bog vegetation was replaced by a sedge fen containing assemblages similar to the present spring-fen channel.
   (7) This sharp reversal from bog to fen under the spring-fen mound can best be explained by the discharge of alkaline groundwater at the peat surface in sufficient quantities to convert the bog vegetation to a spring-fen channel.

AB The attempt to produce a harmonized classification of European mires and to conduct a syntaxonomical analysis on the basis of individual releves has led to the creation of the European Mire Vegetation Database (GIVD ID: EU-00-022, http://ww-w.givd.info/ID/EU-00-022). The database is managed by the Mire Ecology Working Group (Department of Botany and Zoology, Masaryk University, Brno). In May 2015 this database was comprised of 10,147 releves of the classes Scheuchzerio palustris-Caricetea nigrae and Oxycocco-Sphagnetea published in various monographs, manuscripts or journals, but not stored in any other national or regional electronic vegetation databases. Only releves where bryophytes were identified as well as vascular plants were computerized. Most of the newly digitized data are from Northern and Southeastern European regions. Geographical coordinates are available for individual vegetation plots, their accuracy depends on the precision of the location description given. The European Mire Vegetation Database has been integrated in the European Vegetation Archive as a repository of mire vegetation not included in other national or regional databases.

AB Baipadisphaeria spathulospora gen. et sp. nov., a freshwater ascomycete is characterized by black immersed ascomata, unbranched, septate paraphyses, unitunicate, clavate to ovoid asci, lacking an apical structure, and fusiform to almost cylindrical, straight or curved, hyaline to pale brown, unicellular, and smooth-walled ascospores. No anamorph was observed. The species is described from submerged decaying leaves of the peat swamp palm Licuala longicalycata. Phylogenetic analyses based on combined small and large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences showed that it belongs in Nectriaceae (Hypocreales, Hypocreomycetidae, Ascomycota). Baipadisphaeria spathulospora constitutes a sister taxon with weak support to Leuconectria clusiae in all analyses. Based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence, a new genus is proposed.

AB The vegetation of 107 study plots has been described twice, first in the 1960s and 1970s and then again in 1998 and 2003-2005, on the basis of phytosociological releves produced using the Braun-Blanquet method. In addition, soil studies were carried out in 2005 on the basis of soil-core sampling for chemical analysis. The research took in all of the natural types of forest wetlands to be met with in the study area. Phytosociological releves in the two repeat sets were obtained in line with the Braun-Blanquet method, while successional changes were analysed using DCA, on the basis of weighted average values for the species indicator values, analyses of the layer cover of phytocoenoses, number of species, and frequencies and cover of herb-layer vegetation. The analysis of vegetation in the two research periods shows that wetland habitat in the Bialowieza forest has been subject to successional processes conditioned by changes in the environment, i.e. desiccation through a lowering of the water table, and climatic changes inter alia entailing an increase in air temperature at the same time as amounts of precipitation have been falling. The reduced humidity of soils is leading to an accelerated process of peat decay, and hence to increased fertility and acidity of the soils. Changes in habitat conditions are bringing about major changes in both the floristic composition of the herb layer and the structure of the phytocoenoses in marshland and riparian forest habitats.

AB Most knowledge about the degradation of lignocellulose in natural environments is based on woody tissue and aerobic systems; however, in peatlands the contribution of graminoids to organic matter (OM) is often significant and anaerobic conditions prevail. In order to reconstruct past environmental conditions from peatlands and predict possible feedback mechanism between peatlands and climate change, a better understanding of the decomposition of graminoid tissue and the effects of anaerobic conditions on decomposition are needed. Samples (51) from the upper 1 m of the graminoid-dominated Penido Vello peatland (Xistral Mountains, Galicia, NW Spain) were analysed with pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) and C-13 cross polarisation magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (C-13 CPMAS NMR). Carbon and nitrogen contents were also determined. Depth profiles of molecular groups identified using C-13 CPMAS NMR were consistent with those of depth-related distributions of quantified pyrolysis products (aliphatics, polysaccharides and aromatics). Molecular proxies were selected from peat pyrolysates to reflect the state of decay of 1) lignocellulose (the summed lignin and polysaccharide pyrolysis products, Lg and Ps, respectively), 2) lignified cellulose (levoglucosan/Ps) and hemicellulose (4-hydroxy-5,6-dihydro-(2H)-pyran-2-one/Ps), 3) macromolecular lignin including syringyl (S), guaiacyl (G) and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) ratios (S/G; H/(S + G), and side chain oxidation and shortening (vanillic acid/G, syringic acid/S, 4-acetylguaiacol/G, 4-acetylsyringol/S, C-3-guaicols/G and C-3-syringols/S) and 4) non-lignin phenolic acids (4-vinylphenol/H, 4-vinylguaiacol/G). Factor analysis was applied to these proxies and 120 quantified pyrolysis products to examine the influence of possible underlying factors that could explain the observed variation. Botanical changes and several degradation stages including surface decay (both aerobic and anaerobic), aerobic sub-surface decay and depth related decay (long-term anaerobic) were identified with factor analysis and all affected the variance of lignin-based decomposition proxies. The net effect of these environmental factors on the lignin proxies was examined using their depth records. This revealed that some lignin decomposition proxies were not in agreement with the literature: 1) G and S moieties with a C-3 alkyl side chain showed no correlation with bog hydrology at the time of peat formation; 2) G and S moieties with acetyl side chains were related to both relatively dry (secondary aerobic decay) and wet (first stage of decay) conditions; 3) vanillic acid and syringic acid were related partly to ericoids (indicating dry conditions) and partly to free phenolic acids (less depleted under wet conditions); and 4) preferential decay of G over S moieties was found during the first stage of decay (both aerobic and anaerobic) and long-term anaerobic decay. These contradictions can be explained by the dominance of non-woody lignin sources (graminoids) and the prominence of anaerobic decay in peatlands. Our findings indicate that the effect of anaerobic decay and source vegetation should be considered when using lignin proxies to deduce aerobic decay in peat records. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Raised peat bogs harbor unique vegetation types in specific hydrological conditions. Environmental controls of peat bog vegetation are relatively well known for the boreal zone, while in the European boreo-nemoral zone healthy raised bogs are nowadays very rare. By contrast, Latvia, located in the transition zone between the nemoral and the boreal biomes, still has a large number of active raised bogs. The aim of the present study was to characterize the environmental controls on raised bog vegetation structure, species composition and ecology in Latvia. The study includes 17 raised bogs, where vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens were recorded in 480 sample plots and related to environmental variables (microtopography, litter cover, electric conductivity, pH, and macroelements Na, K, Ca, Mg and P in bog surface waters). The factor best explaining total species richness and composition was microtopography, which also affected most other explanatory factors. Thereby total species richness and cover were highest on hummocks. However, the importance and direction of the effects of microtopography and the other factors differed between vegetation groups. When disregarding microtopography, species composition was most strongly correlated with alkaline ions and litter cover and for bryophytes also with vascular plant cover. The present study is the first wide-scale study in Latvia relating raised bog vegetation to environmental conditions.

AB Recent warming at high-latitudes has accelerated permafrost thaw in northern peatlands, and thaw can have profound effects on local hydrology and ecosystem carbon balance. To assess the impact of permafrost thaw on soil organic carbon (OC) dynamics, we measured soil hydrologic and thermal dynamics and soil OC stocks across a collapse-scar bog chronosequence in interior Alaska. We observed dramatic changes in the distribution of soil water associated with thawing of ice-rich frozen peat. The impoundment of warm water in collapse-scar bogs initiated talik formation and the lateral expansion of bogs over time. On average, Permafrost Plateaus stored 137 +/- 37 kg C m(-2), whereas OC storage in Young Bogs and Old Bogs averaged 84 +/- 13 kg C m(-2). Based on our reconstructions, the accumulation of OC in near-surface bog peat continued for nearly 1,000 years following permafrost thaw, at which point accumulation rates slowed. Rapid decomposition of thawed forest peat reduced deep OC stocks by nearly half during the first 100 years following thaw. Using a simple mass-balance model, we show that accumulation rates at the bog surface were not sufficient to balance deep OC losses, resulting inanet loss of OC from the entire peat column. An uncertainty analysis also revealed that the magnitude and timing of soil OC loss from thawed forest peat depends substantially on variation in OC input rates to bog peat and variation in decay constants for shallow and deep OC stocks. These findings suggest that permafrost thaw and the subsequent release of OC from thawed peat will likely reduce the strength of northern permafrost-affected peatlands as a carbon dioxide sink, and consequently, will likely accelerate rates of atmospheric warming.

AB The mid- and late-Holocene vegetation of Walland Marsh (situated on the south coast of England) is reconstructed through multi-proxy (pollen, plant macrofossil and diatom analyses and radiocarbon dating) investigations of an extensive peat layer at five locations. These data, combined with previous work from southern England and regions bordering the southern North Sea, are used to assess the processes controlling the development of, and successional trends in, coastal mire vegetation. On Walland Marsh fen carr vegetation, with Alnus glutinosa, was sustained at sites influenced by the flow of base-rich groundwater from the uplands and more widely promoted by rising relative sea level (RSE). Acidophilous vegetation, including ombrotrophic bog (with Sphagnum imbricatum ssp. austinii present), developed at sites isolated from base-rich water. Spatial isolation was enhanced by the accumulation of peat, while vertical isolation was induced by a decline in the rate of RSL rise and, at ca. 2600 cal. yr BP, by climate change. Similar patterns of mire development can be identified in the other areas reviewed. Vegetation development in coastal lowlands reflects a unique interplay between regional and local processes. These processes can only be disentangled by multi-site investigations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Horticulture in temperate climate zones is energy intensive and the use of peat as the main ingredient in substrates releases additional GHG emissions during mining and processing. This paper evaluates the environmental impact of the co-production and application of bioenergy and biochar using agricultural and woody feedstock to replace natural gas and peat in horticulture by means of a life cycle analysis (LCA), including the timing of CO2 release and uptake, the decay of peat and biochar and the carbon stability of biochar and peat. Lab-scale data on biochar carbon recalcitrance compared to peat (similar to 80% vs. 40% respectively) indicate that spent biochar-based substrates in soil are a carbon storage tool, The combination of bioenergy replacing fossil energy, biochar replacing peat in substrate and long term storage of the spent biochar in soil, contribute to GHG reductions.

AB Vegetation patterns of subalpine gully-head mires were investigated in the flat-topped Lammerlaw and Lammermoor Ranges, South Island, New Zealand. Two intensively studied mires each consist of a series of peaty terraces and scarps. Terraces may contain pools, elongated downslope in the narrow, lower altitude mire, but across slope in the broader, upper mire. A crest occurs on some terrace lips, and marginal "spillways" (channel-like zones) occur down some scarps. Some mires have drained by subsurface pipes.
   Vegetation analysis distinguished between grassland or herbfield on gully sides, vegetation of mire margins, showing aspect differences on the steeper, lower mire, and the vegetation of gully floors, including oligotrophic mire centre vegetation and species-poor pools. The crests, though warmer, bore no special vegetation type.
   Mineral soil beneath the peat indicates a previous non-mire vegetation, which has subsequently paludified. Scarp slumps indicate downslope creep of organic material. Peat fissures, and mineral, vegetation, and erosion dams all appear to have initiated development of some pools.
   Mires are designated gully-head ribbon fens. Patterning appears to be accentuated because of the mires' gully-head location on broad-topped ranges, and drainage of soligenous water from upslope gully sides. These apparently unique fens give insight into patterning in aapa mires, and merit special conservation.

AB The hydrological and floristic variation within a mire vegetation is mostly controlled by three ecological gradients: nutrient availability, acidity-alkalinity, and water table depth. The objectives of this study were: (a) to analyse the hydrochemistry of a mixed mire in relation to different habitat conditions; (b) to evaluate the patterns of vascular plant composition in relation to nutrient availability, acidity-alkalinity, and water table depth, and to partition the pure effects of these gradients. Within a mixed mire, we sampled 36 small plots to cover all vegetation types present. Then, the chemical water properties, and the water regime were measured during a growing season. Water chemistry proved to be significantly different between the various vegetation types. Two biological systems could be identified according to hydrochemistry and vascular plant composition: (1) several fen vegetation types lacking raised Sphagnum structures where the water chemistry reflected groundwater properties; (2) bog Sphagnum-dominated vegetation, where the convex shape of the mire surface prevented mixing with the groundwater. The results of the partitioning indicated that the acidity-alkalinity gradient was more important in controlling the patterns of plant distribution than water table depth.

AB Fertilization experiments were carried out at four stands of mire vegetation in the Biebrza valley, Poland. The stands included two rich fen communities, a moderate-rich/poor fen vegetation and a floodplain fen. In each stand five replicate sets of treatment plots (50 x 50 cm) were selected randomly. Each set consisted of five plots: a control plot, three plots which were fertilized with N, P, K, respectively and one plot with all three elements together. Fertilizer was applied in April. Groundwater and soil were sampled and analysed twice (April, July). In July aboveground biomass was harvested and nutrient concentrations in plant material were examined. Nutrient release from peat to pore water was measured by incubation experiments. Vascular plants were N-limited in the non-flooded fen communities. The vegetation in the floodplain was not limited by nutrients. The results compare well with the hypotheses of Wassen et al. (1995) on expected nutrient limitation of fens in the Biebrza valley, based on nutrient concentrations in (non-fertilized) mire vegetation. However, the critical nutrient concentration and the P/N-quotient in plant material should be regarded as rough indicators only. We expect N to be the controlling factor for the non-flooded fen communities as long as the fens are not drained and N-input by groundwater inflow and atmospheric deposition remains low.

It is described from submerged decaying leaves of the peat swamp palm Licuala longecalycata. Although it is characteristic of the Halosphaeriales, sequencing data indicate it to be distantly related to this order. No genus can be found to accommodate this taxon and based on morphological and molecular evidence, a new genus is justified. The genus is, however, compared with the Halosphaeriales and its taxonomic position discussed.

AB The carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents and decomposition rates of the aboveground litter were measured in five peatlands (bog, poor fen, open moderately rich fen, wooded moderately rich fen, and lacustrine sedge fen) in central Alberta, Canada, over a period of 2 years. Decay rates and C and N content of the dominant species were measured at each site. Weight losses after 1 and 2 years were negatively correlated with initial and final CIN ratios. Weight losses were positively correlated with initial and final %N, with the fastest weight losses in the species with the highest N content. Rates of decay within sites differed according to litter types, with Carex > Betula > mosses. Decay rates and C and N content were also determined for a standard litter type (Carer lasiocarpa), to make cross-site comparisons. Standard litter weight losses differed between sites after 1 and 2 years of decay. The sites ranked poor fen > wooded-rich fen > bog > open-rich fen > sedge fen in order of greatest to smallest percent weight loss after 2 years. After 1 year, weight loss of the standard litter was negatively correlated with water level and pH-related parameters and positively correlated with total dissolved P. Decomposition was correlated with both substrate quality and environmental parameters, but the former may be more important than the latter in controlling decomposition in these peatlands.

AB The above-ground standing crop and nutrient concentrations in plant material were examined in 45 stands of mire vegetation in the Biebrza peatland, Poland. The stands included flood-plains, rich fens, transitional fens and bogs. The pattern in nutrient concentrations in the above-ground plant material resembled the pattern in nutrient concentrations in peatwater and peat which had been investigated in an earlier study. Concentrations of N were quite uniform along the gradient. P-concentrations were highest in the transitional fen. Critical nutrient concentrations were defined on the basis of a review of nutrient concentrations in plant material from peatlands in which a fertilization experiment had been carried out. Defined critical values for phanerogams were: 13-14 and 0.7 mg/g dry wt for N and P respectively. Concentrations lower than these values indicate deficiency. P/N ratios greater than or equal to 0.07 indicate N-deficiency and P/N ratios less than or equal to 0.04-0.05 indicate P-deficiency. According to these values the Biebrza fens and bogs appear to be primarily deficient in N. The growth of the flood-plain vegetation does not appear to be restricted by nutrients.

AB This study predicted the spatiotemporal changes in the CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the pristine peatlands throughout Finland during the 21st century based on 10 km x 10 km grids. The predictions are based on a regional carbon (C) model that emphasizes the mire-type differences in ecohydrology and biogeochemistry. The model was validated by field measurements performed at multiple sites in Finland. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the CO2 flux was more sensitive to changes in temperature than to changes in precipitation, and this temperature sensitivity is greater in fens than in bogs. Conversely, the CH4 emission from pristine fens is more sensitive to the changes in precipitation and temperature than pristine bogs. The spatiotemporal changes in the CO2 and CH4 fluxes were calculated based on the country-scale patterns of mire properties (i.e., fen-bog types, vegetation, topography and peat texture) and the ACCLIM climate change scenarios. The results indicate a decreasing CO2 sinks in the country-scale peatlands, and such a decrease will be most noticeable from 2060 to 2099. In addition, the annual CO2 sink value and the annual CH4 source value of the peatlands will decrease significantly in the western areas of the raised bog region, and such changes will be greater in the pristine fens than in pristine bogs. A large fraction of the fens in the raised-bog region and the southwestern part of the aapa-mire region has the potential to shift from CO2 sinks into weak CO2 sources (<20 g C m(-2) a(-1)) by the end of the 21st century. The transition of bogs from centurial CO2 sinks to sources is most notable near coastal areas. These bogs would function as CO2 sources at an average rate of over 40 g Cm-2 a(-1) for the 21st century under the changing climate scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Question: How do we distinguish between concurrent allogenic and autogenic forcings behind changing patterns in plant community structures during mire development?
   Location: Lakkasuo raised bog, southern Finland.
   Methods: Two radiometrically dated peat profiles were studied using high resolution plant macrofossil analysis. A combination of partial direct and indirect gradient analyses (CCA and DCA) was applied to quantify the role of different drivers of vegetation changes.
   Results: Autogenic hydroseral succession explained 16% of the compositional variation in the vegetation. Disturbance successions initiated by fire explained 15% of the variation in the hummock, but only 9% in the wetter lawn. The early post-disturbance successional stages were characterized by Eriophorum vaginatum. After partialling out the effects of peat depth and time since fire, a moisture gradient explained 29% of variation in the hummock core and 26% in the lawn. The analyses also indicated alternation between species with a similar niche. This interaction gradient explained 26% and 31% of the compositional variation in the hummock and lawn, respectively. The similar order of species replacement from both cores supported the existence of general directional succession in mire vegetation, both during the mire development and after fire events. The autogenic succession was slow and gradual while the disturbance successions were episodic and fast.
   Conclusion: Our results support the paradigm of the complex nature of mire vegetation dynamics where several interlinked agents have simultaneous effects. The approach of combining partial ordinations developed here appeared to be a useful tool to assess the role of different environmental factors in controlling the vegetation succession.

AB Ombrogenous mires, or bogs, are remarkable in that they are organic landforms built from living plants and their partially decayed remains (peat), together with large quantities of water derived directly from precipitation. In the uplands and northwest of the British Isles, they tend to dominate landscapes wherever the slope allows. The components of ombrogenous mires are highly sensitive to change, especially in hydrology. Their vegetation may alter in response to very small changes in water level and/or water chemistry, whereas the underlying peat may undergo total degradation on dewatering. The function of intact mire ecosystems incorporates mechanisms which tend to maintain stability when environmental conditions change; observation indicates, however, that the stability threshold may be crossed under some natural as well as some man-induced circumstances. Sensitivity is demonstrated by evidence from the plant remains preserved in the pear; from manipulation of management practices (particularly grazing and burning); from long-term (28-68 years) mapping of vegetation change, and from experimentation on the sensitivity of bog plants to components of air pollution. The ultimate manifestation of sensitivity is pent erosion, which is widespread in the uplands and may, in places, have been ongoing for several hundred years. It is concluded that we may anticipate heightened sensitivity to cultural perturbation of mire ecosystems during times of climate change, and thus that particular care in our approach to management of blanket peat landscapes is indicated at the present time.

TI MODELS OF THE GEOMORPHOLOGY, HYDROLOGY, AND DEVELOPMENT OF DOMED PEAT
   BODIES
SO GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB Because peat accumulates only beneath the water table, the shape of a peat body should reflect the shape of its water table and thus the hydrology of the peat body.  Three different models successfully reproduce the observed peat dome morphology, including a central bog plain.  In the first model, the bog plain develops because peat accumulation is limited by anaerobic decay of peat beneath the water table.  With certain simplifying assumptions, an analytic solution for this model can be obtained.  The other two models are more easily investigated numerically.  In the first model, the initial peat accumulation rate is limited only by plant growth and decay and is the maximum rate observed during peat dome development.  As a peat dome expands laterally, peat accumulation slows because the water table ceases to rise fast enough to preserve all the available plant material.  Eventually, anaerobic decay beneath the water table matches the rate of peat addition to the top of the peat body, and net peat accumulation ceases.
   In the second model, peat accumulation is assumed to begin simultaneously over a wide area.  The central bog plain is a transient feature; the peat dome fails to reach a steady-state condition for long after peat begins to accumulate.  Peat accumulation rates in the central bog plain are either constant or vary as a function of climate.
   In the third model, the height of the water table is controlled primarily by ground-water inflow from an underlying aquifer.  The maximum height the water table can reach is the head in the underlying aquifer.  If the area over which ground-water influx occurs is sufficiently broad, and the hydraulic conductivity is sufficiently low, most of the peat dome can develop a water table that is nearly at its maximum possible height, thus creating the central bog plain.  Peat accumulation rates in this model decrease with time.
   Comparison of theoretical predictions with observed peat dome morphologies shows a good correspondence between the predicted and observed profiles of the peat domes for all three models.  A comparison of apparent peat accumulation with the first model, assuming no anaerobic decay, shows a good correspondence for a Sumatran core.  The third model probably could be calibrated to match this core as well.  A core from a German Sphagnum peat bog provides clear evidence of anaerobic decay because of an increase in growth rate with time.  By reducing the thickness of early deposited layers, anaerobic decay can result in an apparent increase in peat accumulation rate, even if the actual rate of addition of the peat to the surface declines with time.

AB Diffusion is usually thought to be ineffective at transporting solutes over distances of several metres - the depth of many peat deposits. But this is to neglect the importance of time. We derive equations that show that in peat that has accumulated over millennia then diffusion alone can remove to the air about 95 % of the gases carbon dioxide and methane generated by microbial decay within the main peat mass. Gas concentration profiles in simulations of peat grown slice-by-slice over 10,000 years have a smooth convex profile with concentration increasing downwards, as they do in Nature.

AB The vegetation of two boreal mires drained for forestry was studied prior to and after restoration (removal of tree stand and filling in of ditches). The restoration induced a rapid rise in the water table level and caused relatively rapid changes in plant species composition and cover. On the minerotrophic fen site, the number of forest species declined and the cover of Eriophorum vaginatum increased five-fold, reaching over 50% cover in three years. On the ombrotrophic bog site, the terrestrial lichens disappeared, while the cover of Empetrum nigrum, Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum, and Sphagnum balticum increased. Changes in water table level and vegetation indicate a change towards a functional mire ecosystem.

AB Alder wood peat is regularly found in central Europe, but palaeoecological studies of alder wood peat are rare, mainly because of lack of identifiable pollen and macrofossils. One central question is whether alder wood peat accumulates under alder carr vegetation (primary) or as displacement peat with alder roots growing into existing peat formed under open fen vegetation (secondary). Standard palaeoecological methods have proven unsuited to solve this question. This paper presents a surface sample study testing whether non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) can be used for identifying various types of fen vegetation, especially alder carrs, and for reconstructing the formation of wood peat. Different substrate types (litter, moss, dead wood, water and exposed peat surface) were sampled in 10 alder carrs, one birch cart and three sites with open fen vegetation in NE-Germany and analysed for pollen and NPPs. Vegetation relevees were recorded and water and soil conditions were measured. We overall recorded 412 NPP types, including 36 known EMA types (recorded in alder carr) and 51 HDV types (recorded in other ecosystems). For present publication we selected the 96 most abundant and characteristic NPPs (including 14 HDV types and 36 known EMA types). 46 NPP types are newly described and illustrated.
   Our study shows that, opposed to pollen, NPP types clearly reflect the different fen vegetation types making NPPs a valuable tool in palaeoecological studies of fen peat. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; ECOLOGICAL GRADIENTS; TERMINOLOGY; DIVERSITY
AB In the present study, we describe the variation in rich fen (brown moss-dominated) vegetation of boreal uplands in Norway, based on studies in two nature reserves representing an oceanic and a more continental area. The vegetation description included 134 sample plots and 200 taxa, using TWINSPAN classification and DCA ordination. The main aims were to describe the rich fen vegetation used for traditional haymaking, to find important ecological gradients and to compare the fen vegetation to the main European classification systems. We classified the fen vegetation into six plant communities. Rich (including extremely rich) fen vegetation of lawns and open margins were most common, representing the alliances Caricion atrofuscae, including alpine/continental species like Equisetum variegatum and Pedicularis oederi and Schoenion ferruginei (Caricion davallianae), including lowland/oceanic species like Drosera longifolia and Narthecium ossifragum. A majority of the constant species were in common for the two alliances, e.g. Thalictrum alpinum, Trichophorum cespitosum, Campylium stellatum and Gymnocolea borealis. The lawn communities included 3038 species per plot (12.5 m2). We classified the flat fens with carpet communities dominated by Scorpidium cossonii and S. scorpioides to the alliances StygioCaricion limosae and Caricion lasiocarpae. The carpets contained ca 30 species per plot. Shrub-dominated fen margin represents SphagnoTomentypnion, with the highest species number, more than 50 species per plot, including Molinia caerulea as a constant and abundant species, and a large number of herbs as constants. The plots of the margin community were in an overgrowing process, invaded by shrubs and wet grassland species. The peak in floristic diversity in abandoned margin communities fits well with both the humped-back model of species richness and the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

AB Boreal peatlands are a major long-term reservoir of atmospheric carbon (C) and play an important role in the global C cycle. It is unclear how C accumulation in peatlands responds to changing temperatures and nutrients (specifically, nitrogen and sulfur). In this study, we assessed how the C input rate and C accumulation rate in decadal old peat layers respond to increased air temperatures (+3.6 degrees C) during the growing season and the annual additions of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) (30 and 20kgha(-1)yr(-1), respectively) over 12years of field treatments in a boreal mire. An empirical mass balance model was applied to Pb-210-dated peat cores to evaluate changes in C inputs, C mass loss, and net C accumulation rates in response to the treatments. We found that (i) none of the treatments generated a significant effect on peat mass loss decay rates, (ii) C input rates were positively affected by N additions and negatively affected by S additions, (iii) the C accumulation rate in the uppermost (10 to 12cm) peat was increased by N additions and decreased by S additions, and (iv) only air temperature significantly affected the main effects induced by N and S additions. Based on our findings, we argue that C accumulation rates in surface peat layers of nutrient-poor boreal mires can increase despite the predicted rise in air temperatures as long as N loads increase and acid atmospheric S remains low.

AB We investigated species composition and relative abundance of Sphagnum fallax dominated peatlands in relation to measured environmental variables on the basis of 26 sites in the Wielkopolska region. Most studied plots were characterized by soft waters, poor in Ca2+ but rich in nutrients, especially N-NH4 (+) and P-PO4 (3-), with high electrolytic conductivity and high DOC (dissolved organic carbon) concentration. Six of the 19 measured variables of surface water chemistry (DOC, pH, SO4 (2-), P-PO4 (3-), Na+ and Ca2+) significantly explained 23% of the variation in floristic composition. In 65 vegetation plots, 107 species were observed. Cluster analysis revealed four types of vegetation in the studied mires. Sphagnum fallax was the most abundant species and formed plant communities in a wide range of habitats: in floating mats, with the plants usually adjoining the mineral basin edge (e.g. E. vaginatum, Andromeda polifolia and Ledum palustre) as well as it occupied central parts of Sphagnum lawn (e.g. Eriophorum angustifolium) and rich fen habitats (e.g. Carex rostrata or Phragmites australis). In Wielkopolska terrestrializating peatlands, four variables determine the poor-rich gradient: conductivity, DOC, SiO2 dissolved, Ca2+ and alkalinity. This study provides new data on the ecology and typology of Sphagnum peatlands in western Poland.

AB Samples of organic material derived from two hummock-forming species (Sphagnum fuscum and S. rubellum) and two hollow species (Sphagnum cuspidatum and S. magellanicum) were collected from several depths in a southern Swedish raised bog and rates of CO2 emission were measured in the laboratory under aerated conditions at 18-degrees-C. The rate of CO2 release from the most recently deposited Sphagnum peat litter from the 2.5-5 cm depth layer was nearly twice as high (0.66 mg CO2 g-1 d-1) as that from older organic material from the 10-12.5 cm depth layer (0.35 mg CO2 g-1 d-1) under common conditions of temperature, moisture and aeration. No consistent differences in CO2 emission rates were detected among the four Sphagnum species for the shallow organic material tested. However, when deeper (50-100 cm) Sphagnum-dominated peat samples were exposed to the same aerated conditions, peat formed by the hummock-forming species released CO2 at a slower rate (0.23 mg g-1 d-1) than the two hollow species (0.29 mg g-1 d-1). The results suggest that the amount of previous exposure of Sphagnum peat to decay processes may be more important than the species composition in determining subsequent rates of decay and carbon loss.
   The observed rates of CO2 emission were used to estimate the annual mass loss from aerobically decaying organic material under the thermal regime at the study site. Based on these estimates, Sphagnum litter loses about 5% of its dry mass annually during the initial stages of decay, but the decay rate decreases to 2-3% annually for deeper Sphagnum peat exposed to aerobic conditions.

AB Excessive nutrient supply may threaten the carbon storage function of nutrient limited peatlands. We conducted a detailed study in a bog ecosystem (Wylde Lake peatland, Canada), which was once ombrotrophic and since AD 1954 borders a water reservoir, which is enriched with nutrients. Our objective was to elucidate whether the inner peatland parts maintain typical characteristics of a pristine bog. To achieve this goal, along a transect of study sites, we dated peat cores, determined nutrient concentrations and N input and mapped the vegetation. The peatland's central part showed large N input rates of similar to 4.3 g N.m(-2).y(-1), but even greater rates of 5.90 +/- 0.10 g N.m(-2).y(-1), were found in the periphery. Elements essential for plant growth, such as N, P, S, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn were increased in concentration upwards in the profile of all peat cores, especially near the reservoir, presumably due to supply by the reservoir water. Also, a more graminoid dominated vegetation near the reservoir indicated a transformation of the once ombrotrophic bog into a poor fen. To our surprise and in contrast to previous studies the peatland did not seem to decay after long-term excessive nutrient load, instead it accelerated peat accumulation, leading to maximum growth rates of up to 500 g C.m(-2).y(-1) immediately after flooding of the reservoir. Peatland functioning in terms of carbon storage appeared maintained. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A suite of techniques, including coal petrology, micropalynology, mesofossil analysis, and macroscopic appearance has been used to examine the Early Permian, South African, Witbank Basin No. 2 seam from a sample locality near Ogies. This coal appears to be similar in its palynological and petrographic composition to other coals of this interval from this basin. However, its accumulation appears to have been largely hypautochthonous or allochthonous evidenced by, erosive contacts, small scale cross-laminations, and fine lenticular bodies being recognised within the coal seam profile. This ex situ deposition probably, in part, relates to frequent wildfire activity, which may have promoted subsequent run-off and erosion, and led to the numerous mineral-rich horizons observed in the sample seam profile.
   In addition to the sedimentological characters described above, the petrology of the seam and its mesofossils, most particularly megaspores from a lycopsid parent vegetation, indicate saturated peat-forming conditions. However, examination of charred mesofossil fragments indicates periods of low humidity and even drying of the peat itself rendering it liable to combustion. These contradictory characters may indicate seasonality and suggest a coldness of the climate, at least for part of the year, that could account for the retardation of peat decay during these drier intervals. These characters can be reconciled with deposition during an interglacial phase as the Dwyka glaciation terminates, as has previously been proposed for the Witbank Basin No. 2 seam.

AB We examined how hydrology influenced water chemistry, vegetation, nutrient status, aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and litter decomposition rates in two mires on the South-Eastern Alps of Italy. One of the mires had a modest hydraulic gradient and prevalently acted as a recharge system, although there were short phases of vertical flow reversal during dry periods. This mire was, therefore, prevalently fed by rainwater and was covered by bog-like vegetation, mainly hummocks and scrubs with a ground layer rich in Sphagnum mosses. The other mire presented a steeper hydraulic gradient, with the surface being fed by mineral water either by surface runoff or by vertical, upwards directed ground water flow. Compared to the bog-dominated mire, the pore water was less acidic and richer in telluric cations. This mire was covered by fen-like vegetation, prevalently fen meadows. Nitrogen (N) content in the vegetation was very similar in the two mire sites, while phosphorus (P) content was lower in the fen-dominated site. Contrary to our expectations. ANPP did not differ significantly between the two mire sites while litter decomposition rates were significantly lower in the fen-dominated mire, presumably because of P limitation of decomposers. This suggests that the development of ombrogenous mires in this region need not be due to increased accumulation of peat during succession from mineralwater-fed to rainwater-fed conditions.

AB Boreal mires are globally important carbon stores. In nutrient poor mires, i.e. bogs, vegetation is highly structured between hydrologically different microforms: hummocks, lawns and hollows. We studied whether the vegetation structure in four boreal bogs is reflected in the actinobacterial decomposer communities.
   Vegetation was determined by projection cover of plant species. Actinobacteria were detected from peat profiles at depths of 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm by molecular methods. The data was analysed by a hierarchical set of ordinations.
   The inter-bog variation in plant communities was insignificant, while the intra-bog differences (microforms) at each bog were highly significant. This variation was reflected in actinobacteria communities in the two upper peat layers. The deepest peat layer (40-60 cm) showed some inter-bog differences, possibly due to the different history of the bogs.
   Our results show that the actinobacteria communities reflect the variation in bog vegetation, which in turn is tied to hydrological conditions. The possible alterations in the water level caused by changing climate are likely to cause predictable changes in vegetation and microbial communities in bog ecosystems.

AB The role of sheep grazing on vegetation change in upland mires removed from livestock farming and surrounded by conifer plantation was investigated with a grazing trial at Butterburn Flow in northern England. Paired grazed and ungrazed plots from central and peripheral locations were compared over 14 yr. Vegetation data from 34 mires in Kielder Forest provided an ordination framework within which vegetation trends were investigated. A gradient from dry moorland/hummock to wet mire/hollow vegetation dominated this framework and may reflect hydrological variability and structural vegetation differences between the mires.
   Some species were significantly affected by change in grazing intensity and there were differences between the edge and the centre of the mire. Overall vegetation change depended upon the grazing management and the position of the plots such that the removal of sheep grazing decreased the cover of species typical of wet ombrotrophic conditions, but only at the periphery of the mire. The vegetation in one plot became very similar to that of mires elsewhere in Kielder Forest where sheep were removed several decades ago.
   Cessation of grazing on upland mires is likely to lead to slow structural and species change in vegetation at the mire edge with a long-term loss of ombrotrophic species. The nature conservation significance of these changes will depend upon whether or not management objectives target natural conditions or wish to maximize ombrotrophic vegetation. The context of external factors such as climate and pollution may, however, be more important in determining site condition on the wettest mires.

AB We monitored vegetation changes in an alpine mire after stopping an experiment of nutrient addition, during which the mire experienced a heat wave. We aimed at assessing the capacity of mire vegetation to recover towards the original state. Nitrogen and phosphorus were added during the growing seasons of 2002-2009. We recorded periodically the cover of all vascular plant species and moss species from 2002 to 2012, i.e., 9 years after the heat wave and 3 years after discontinuing fertilization. The principal effect of the 2003 heat wave consisted in a rapid increase in cover of vascular plants and a parallel decrease in cover of mosses. These trends slowed down after 6 years and almost totally halted 9 years after the heat wave. The heat wave was the main driver of vegetation changes but the vegetation also responded to fertilization. Species within plant functional types (PFTs) showed differing responses to the heat wave and/or fertilization. The mire vegetation showed poor capacity to recover towards the initial conditions. Changes in vegetation composition were determined by individualistic responses of species to varying ecological factors. Grouping plant species into PFTs may conceal important differences in the responses of mire vegetation to environmental changes.

AB We used a case study (Hirvisuo mire complex, southern aapa mire zone, Finland) to describe a new morphological classification for aapa mires and used as a basis the broad, vegetation-based ecological aapa-mire concept. It deviates from the narrow morphological aapa-mire concept referring solely to patterned fens. Three scales (micro, meso and macro) were applied for the morphology. The important meso scale included eight different units. Units were delineated on aerial photographs. Macro scale included the whole complex and its bisection to central and peripheral aapa-mire areas according to the horizontal water flow pattern within the whole complex. Stability of water regime was mainly inferred from vegetation on the basis of previous literature about the ecology of mire site types and other vegetation units described in Finland and Sweden. Groundwater recharge-discharge pattern was also mainly inferred from mire vegetation supported by previous, sporadic groundwater level measurements in the mineral soil formation south of the study area. For the importance of understanding the whole geo-hydro-ecologic system as a unit, the landscape level is stressed.

AB This chapter reviews the literature on the ecology and geography of mires and their vegetation in the former Soviet Union. In the "Introduction" mires are defined and the types of mire systems included in the review are described. In the first section mire classification systems are discussed with an emphasis on physiognomic, phytogeographical and multilevel systems of classification. The second section is an ecological description of mire vegetation for the eight main types of mires that were recognized in the former Soviet Union: polygonal mires, palsa mires, aapa mires, raised bogs, pine bogs, larch bogs, alder swamps and sedge fens. In the third section of the review ecological characteristics of mires (primary production, decomposition, regulation processes) are considered with special attention given to raised bogs. The final section is a discussion of the various uses of mires by man and nature conservation measures that existed in the former Soviet Union. The objective of providing this historical review is to establish a framework for consideration of changes that have occurred in the classification, management, and conservation of mires in recent years in countries that were part of the former Soviet Union. The review also provides a list of references that were not readily available during the time of the former Soviet Union.

AB Permafrost in peatlands of subarctic Sweden is presently thawing at accelerated rates, which raises questions about the destiny of stored carbon and nutrients and impacts on adjacent freshwater ecosystems. In this study we use peat and lake sediment records from the Stordalen palsa mire in northern Sweden to address the late Holocene (5,000 cal BP-present) development of the mire as well as related changes in carbon and nutrient cycling. Formation, sediment accumulation and biogeochemistry of two studied lakes are suggested to be largely controlled by the development of the mire and its permafrost dynamics. Peat inception took place at ca. 4,700 cal BP as a result of terrestrialisation. Onset of organic sedimentation in the adjacent lakes occurred at ca. 3,400 and 2,650 cal BP in response to mire expansion and permafrost aggradation, respectively. Mire erosion, possibly due to permafrost decay, led to re-deposition of peat into one of the lakes after ca. 2,100 cal BP, and stimulated primary productivity in the other lake at ca. 1,900-1,800 cal BP. Carbonate precipitation appears to have been suppressed when acidic poor fen and bog (palsa) communities dominated the catchment mire, and permafrost-induced changes in hydrology may further have affected the inflow of alkaline water from the catchment. Elevated contents of biogenic silica and diatom pigments in lake sediments during periods of poor fen and bog expansion further indicate that terrestrial vegetation influenced the amount of nutrients entering the lake. Increased productivity in the lake likely caused bottom-water anoxia in the downstream lake and led to recycling of sediment phosphorous, bringing the lake into a state of self-sustained eutrophication during two centuries preceding the onset of twentieth century permafrost thaw. Our results give insight into nutrient and permafrost dynamics in a subarctic wetland and imply that continued permafrost decay and related vegetation changes towards minerotrophy may increase carbon and nutrient storage of mire deposits and reduce nutrient fluxes in runoff. Rapid permafrost degradation may on the other hand lead to widespread mire erosion and to relatively short periods of significantly increased nutrient loading in adjacent lakes.

AB High-resolution vegetation maps, at 1:500 scale, were realized in three mires located in the Italian south-eastern Alps (Coltrondo West, 12,800m(2); Coltrondo South, 22,300m(2) and PalU di sotto, 50,600m(2)). Vegetation maps were based on topography surveyed by GPS, performed on ground surveys and produced using ArcGIS 9.1. A total of 36 plant communities, whose distribution was reported on the maps, were individuated and classified according to the Braun-Blanquet method. The mires strongly differed from each other with regard to vegetation cover, with Coltrondo West having a prevalent bog-like vegetation and Coltrondo South a prevalently fen-like vegetation. At PalU di sotto, bog-like vegetation covered a surface fed by ground water. This pattern could be explained by the lowering of water table determined by intensive water extraction for human activities. The maps will be profitably used as reference for future monitoring of vegetation dynamics under changing climatic and landuse conditions.

AB The composition of the vegetation of fishpond mires in the Trebon Basin (Czech Republic) was studied in relation to temporal fluctuations in certain environmental factors. The water-table depth, water pH and electrical conductivity at 49 permanent plots were measured at approximately three-week intervals from March to October 2003. Minimum, maximum, mean, median and variation in the above-mentioned environmental factors were correlated with vegetation composition. The most important environmental factors explaining the variation in vegetation were mean pH and maximum water-table level. Median conductivity increased with increase in waterlogging and eutrophication. Some seasonal trends in the dynamics of these parameters were observed. The lowest conductivity was in spring, increased continuously throughout summer and peaked in autumn. In contrast, water level decreased in summer, when evapotranspiration was greatest, and rose in autumn after heavy rainfall. The pH increased from March to June, then was stable and decreased at the end of summer. Seasonal trends were generally identical in all vegetation types. The fluctuations in the environmental factors were so considerable that they may influence the reliability of vegetation environmental analyses.

AB Meesia triquetra is a circumpolar boreo-arctic moss species typical for well preserved fens, and is rare in southern Europe. During field research on mire vegetation in the Balkan Peninsula, a population of Meesia triquetra was found at the Begovo pole wetland in the Jakupica Mountains. It is the first record of this species for the Republic of Macedonia. A description of the locality, ecological conditions and vegetation is presented. The moss grows here in the sedge-moss vegetation similar to temperate fens of the alliance Caricion davallianae. The vegetation with Meesia triquetra in Begovo pole was evaluated in the context of fen vegetation more generally in the Balkans using detrended correspondence analysis. The study site appeared to be similar to other Balkan calcium-rich brown-moss fens without calcium carbonate precipitation. This habitat resembles the optimum habitat of the species in central and northern Europe.

AB 1. Hydrological changes due to drainage and climate warming can have great impact on the ecosystem balance of boreal mires. The possibility of ombrotrophication, i.e. the development from fen to bog, in response to altered hydrology has not been previously tested. Here, recent changes in vegetation and surface peat are studied in an aapa mire, a typical boreal mire system dominated by fen vegetation. Drainage in the catchment from 1968 onwards led to the change from richly minerogenous to ombrogenous hydrology, thus providing a long-term ombrotrophication experiment.
   2. A sequence of aerial photographs (1941, 1953, 1965, 1974, 1984, 1995, 2005) revealed a dramatic shift from fen vegetation to the nearly complete dominance of peat mosses (Sphagnum) within two decades after the catchment disturbance.
   3. A distinct change from Carex peat to Sphagnum peat at the average depth of 23.3 cm (SE 0.8 cm) was found in 18 peat cores. All of the new Sphagnum peat had accumulated within the last four decades. This was verified by the relationship of age and rooting depth of 37 small pines (Pinus sylvestris) and by two pollen density profiles. The ratio Ca/Mg diminished towards the surface of peat profiles indicating change from minerogenous to ombrogenous hydrology. In accordance, extremely low pH (range 3.8-4.2) and conductivity (average 14.5 mu s cm(-1)) were measured in the surface pore water.
   4. The average total dry mass of new Sphagnum peat was 7042 g m(-2) (SE 442) and the recent apparent rate of carbon accumulation was 100.6 g m(-2) year(-1) (SE 6.3), as calculated for a 35-year period and 50% carbon content.
   5. Synthesis. Remarkable potential for vegetation change and increase of peat growth is demonstrated in boreal aapa mires. Ombrotrophication can be initiated within a few decades in response to reduced input of minerogenous water. Future changes in the hydrological cycle, as indicated by climate change models, are similar to the impact of catchment disturbance in aapa mires. Diminished total water budgets during the summer cause a decrease of minerogenous input and a drawdown of water level, both of which may promote the growth of Sphagnum over fen vegetation.

AB Decomposition rates and changes of carbon and nitrogen contents of Sphagnum litter in mire vegetation can help to explore the ecological effects of climate change and the role of environmental factors from a local to an ecosystem scale. The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between mentioned parameters in small and isolated Sphagnum dominated mires. Measurements had been conducted throughout a year by placing litterbags filled with Sphagnum biomass in three vegetation types (open peat bog, poor fen, alder carr) of a mire ecosystem in Hungary. Peat decomposition rates differed to a great extent; the slowest decomposition rate (39.1 +/- 9.52%) was in the alder carr, indicating that slower decomposition could be characteristic for this kind of vegetation type of mire. Between Sphagnum dominated microhabitats, open peat bog showed medium (65.57 +/- 4.05) while poor fen the fastest (68.61 +/- 5.5) rates in decomposition. The C/N ratio of the Sphagnum litter showed significant decrease (P<0.005) in all studied micro-environments. Slower N release was observed from litter of Alnus dominated association (31.3 +/- 6.9%) compared to Sphagnum dominated ones (56.5 +/- 8.3%). Our findings showed that the decomposition rates were more dependent on vegetation type than C/N ratio and this relationship was also revealed at a small spatial scale.

AB The contemporary role of mires in carbon exchange with the atmosphere is intensely debated. Thus, understanding the variation in Holocene peat accumulation is particularly important. We investigated carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) accumulation rates and their potential controls during the Holocene at the oligotrophic fen Degero Stormyr (64 degrees 11N, 19 degrees 33E, 270 m a.s.l.), Sweden. The peat stratigraphy was dominated by remains of Eriophorum spp. and oligotrophic-mesotrophic Sphagnum spp. The long-term rate of C accumulation (LORCA) was 13.7 +/- 5.5 (SD) g C m(-2) yr(-1), while the long-term rate of N accumulation (LORNA) was 0.28 +/- 0.14 (SD) g N m(-2) yr(-1). Carbon and N accumulation rates exhibited similar variations that coincided with major changes in botanical composition. The botanical composition of the peat also had a major impact on the percentage of amorphous peat (a proxy for degree of decomposition). Bulk C-13 values increased with decreasing C content, which probably reflected the relative increase of C-13 depleted compounds in the peat during decomposition. Different plant groups exhibited different relationships, likely due to different C-13 signatures of initial litters from Eriophorum spp. and Sphagnum spp. The N-15 values increased significantly with decreasing C:N ratio in bulk peat, likely reflecting preferential uptake of N-14 by plants concomitant with nitrogen mineralization. Here, we demonstrate the importance of botanical composition in affecting C and N accumulation rates under a changing climate and suggest that primary production drives the variation in rates of accumulation. Furthermore, we point out the importance of including C-13 and N-15 signatures in the analysis of peat stratigraphies to advance interpretation of Holocene peat growth and decay.

AB Various stages in the succession of vegetation of peat bogs following disturbance were studied in the Trebon Basin, Czech Republic. The disturbance was of two types: (a) natural. represented by windthrow, with subsequent bark beetle attack, and fire. and (b) human-made peat digging and industrial peat milling. The species composition at different stages ill Succession following disturbance were compared with that in undisturbed plots. Regeneration of peat bog vegetation was faster after a natural than after human-made disturbance. The lowest impact was caused by windthrow, followed by fire. Regeneration after peat digging took much longer. Regeneration after industrial peat harvesting only occurred if the groundwater table level remained high.

AB Equations based on empirical relationships of peat physical properties were used to estimate the average long-term apparent rate of carbon accumulation (LORCA) in Finnish mire vegetation regions. The results were generalized to the boreal and subarctic regions. Analyses of 1302 dated peat cores were used to infer carbon accumulation for each mire vegetation region of Finland. The area-weighted LORCA for Finnish undrained mire areas was 18.5 g m(-2) yr(-1) and the total carbon sink 0.79 Tg yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12)g). The total carbon pool of Finnish undrained mires was estimated as 2257 Tg. The aapa-mire region included 80% of the total net accumulation rate of carbon and 85% of the total carbon reservoirs of Finnish undrained mires. LORCA was significantly higher in the raised-bog region, 26.1 g m(-2) yr(-1), compared with the aapa-mire region, 17.3 g m(-2) yr(-1), and bogs generally had a higher LORCA 20.8 g m(-2) yr(-1), than fens 16.9 g m(-2) yr(-1). The total C sink for boreal and subarctic mires was estimated at 66 Tg yr(-1) which is about 31% lower than the previous estimates. The total C pool of all boreal and subarctic mires was estimated at 270-370 Pg (1 Pg = 10(15)g).

AB The peat soil is a special soil which has obvious regional characteristics. A series of staged cyclic loading triaxial tests is performed to investigate the dynamic deformation properties of the peat soil in Kunming under the conditions of different confining pressures, different consolidation ratios, and different loading frequencies. The effects of confining pressure, consolidation ratio, and loading frequency on the deformation properties of the peat soil subjected to cyclic loading are evaluated through analyzing the dynamic backbone curve, stress-strain hysteretic curve and dynamic elastic modulus. Results show that the dynamic strain of peat soil increases nonlinearly with the dynamic stress amplitude, and there exists a critical stress value at the backbone curve. When the dynamic stress amplitude acting on the soil reaches its critical stress value, the strain of peat soils grows rapidly, and then the soil structure is destroyed; the confining pressure has the most significant effect on the dynamic deformation properties of peat soil, followed by the consolidation ratio, loading frequency is the minimum; the effect of consolidation ratio on the dynamic deformation properties of peat soil depends on the value of confining pressure, which is greater under higher confining pressure; the elastic deformation of peat soil decreases as confining pressure and consolidation ratio increase, while increases as loading frequency decrease, at the same loading level; the stiffness of peat soil decays as loading cycles and loading level increase, the plastic deformation appears and cumulatively grows up; the larger plastic deformation is observed in peat soil with increasing confining pressure and consolidation ratio, decreasing loading frequency.

AB The aim of the present study was to use the analysis of surface water chemistry to understand vegetation succession pathways in terrestrializing polyhumic lakes. We hypothesized that Sphagnum mire development was accompanied by a decrease in the mineral content in water. A total of 111 vegetation plots along 23 transects were analysed in 11 lakes and adjacent peat lands in the Wigry National Park (NE Poland). The vegetation of the lake-mire systems forms distinct zones: (1) nymphaeid-, bladderwort- and bryophyte-dominated aquatic vegetation; (2) sedge-dominated edge of the Sphagnumcarpet; (3) quaking, extremely poor fen with various Cyperaceae; (4) non-quaking, Eriophorum vaginatum-dominated bog-like vegetation and (5) pine woodland. Surface water corrected conductivity (ECcorr.), pH, COD-KMnO4 and Ca2+, Mg2+, Fetot. and SiO2 were measured along the transects. The environmental gradients best explaining the observed pattern were pH (with the highest values in the lake and the lowest in the bog-like vegetation) and COD-KMnO4 (showing an inverse direction). At least in some Sphagnummires conditions were more minerotrophic than in the lakes. The process of humic lake overgrowing by Sphagnum-mires in NE Poland results in pine woodlands on mineralised peat. The climate conditions in NE Poland, combined with evapotranspiration accelerated by encroaching trees, do not seem to support the development of ombrotrophic bogs.

AB The abiotic conditions and fen vegetation in three lowland mires were analysed. Two of these mires are in the Netherlands. They have deteriorated considerably as a result of human pressure. One mire complex is in Poland. Its hydrology is almost undisturbed. The variation in the water composition in the fens was associated with the variation in the amount of regional groundwater discharge originating from the uplands, and to a lesser extent by the infiltration of polluted water pumped into the fens.
   The 26 vegetation types ranged from poor fen to eutrophic reedland. Most types were typical for only one region.
   There were clear differences between the three regions. Both the species composition and the water quality for the vegetation types indicated that the fens in the Vecht river plain are eutrophicated, whereas the fens in Northwestern Overijssel suffer from acidification. The Biebrza valley fens are well developed and are mainly fed by fresh calcareous groundwater.
   Stepwise logistic regression performed on 28 fen species revealed that the hydrochemical variables explained only a part of the variance: the regional variable 'area' explained a considerable amount of the variance for most species. In 27% of the cases it was possible to fit an optimum curve for the species response to relevant hydrochemical variables. Monotonic curves could be fitted in 64% of the cases; mostly they described the response to variables in a way that is supported by ecological literature. It was concluded that the dataset should be constructed differently to enable the calculation of generally applicable standards.

AB The Malloryville Wetland Complex, a small kettle-hole peatland, contains a diversity of peatland types. The wetland has a 'rich' side that contains wetland vegetation associated with solute-rich, near-neutral pH (minerotrophic) water, and a 'poor' side containing vegetation that grows in solute-poor and acidic (ombrotrophic) water. Vertical head gradients at piezometer clusters located in the rich side clearly show that groundwater is moving upwards towards the land surface, consistent with the vegetation types and surface water quality. In contrast, vertical head gradients also show that groundwater is moving upward in the poor side even though the vegetation and surface water chemistry are not minerotrophic. An incipient raised bog in the center of the poor side is the only site where groundwater moves consistently downward.
   A peat core collected at the bog center shows that the bog site was initially covered by minerotrophic vegetation, typically found in groundwater discharge zones, which was later replaced by ombrotrophic bog vegetation. Theoretical computer simulation experiments of the bog hydrogeologic setting through time suggest that the direction of vertical groundwater flow at the bog site permanently changed from up to down when a water table mound developed under a convex-shaped fen peat mound that probably formed because of differential peat accumulation. Ombrotrophic conditions and bog vegetation probably began when the fen water table mound grew sufficiently large enough to divert the upward movement of regional groundwater. The transition from rich to poor environments probably occurred when the wetland water table was substantially below the elevation of the surrounding regional water table.

AB . The decision was taken by an opencast coal mining company to translocate on-site blanket bog vegetation, on completion of mining, at a site in Co. Durham, UK, both to preserve it and to use it to enhance recolonization. The vegetation of the treatments was monitored for seven years after site completion and this paper reports on the progress of the translocated material and its effect on recolonization. Translocation of large turves of blanket bog into carefully prepared receptor cells preserved most of the vegetation intact, but resulted in severe decline in the frequency of Sphagnum, while the design of the receptor site as strips of translocated vegetation enclosing strips of spread, stored peat accelerated recolonization of the intervening bare peat by Calluna vulgaris, but not of other target species. This attempt to translocate blanket bog vegetation and at the same time use it to accelerate recolonization was only partly successful. It was concluded that the ecological requirements of species known to be significant for ecosystem function, such as Sphagnum, must be fulfilled if translocation of blanket bog is to be attempted in future.

AB Question: What are the effects of shallow flooding on boreal peatlands on vegetation composition and size of carbon pools in the living and dead vegetation?
   Location: Lake 979, Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario, Canada.
   Methods: A boreal basin peatland complex with treed bog, open bog, and open water was experimentally flooded by raising water level ca. 1.3 m. Vegetation and above-ground biomass were compared between pre-flood conditions and those nine years after flooding. Peat accumulation since flooding was also quantified.
   Results: Flooding caused almost all trees to die, leading to a net loss of 86% of the above-ground living plant biomass after nine years of the flooding. Floating up of peat was rapid in the central part of the basin, and the floating peat mats were characterized by newly established open bog community. Wetland types were diversified from bog into open bog, fen, and marsh, accompanied with great species turnover. Floating open bog community accumulated the greatest amount of peat since flooding.
   Conclusions: This study shows that shallow flooding of bog vegetation can lead to quick re-establishment of open bog vegetation upon the floating up of peat mats as well as changes to more diverse vegetation over decadal time spans. We estimate that the carbon pools in 2002 in living and dead plant biomass since 1992 are comparable to what they were in the above-ground biomass in 1992. Flooding caused an initial net decrease in carbon stores, but carbon in the pre-flood living plant biomass was replaced by both carbon in dead biomass of the pre-flood vegetation and newly sequestered carbon in new peat growth and post-flood living plant biomass. Possible vegetation change toward bog-dominated system could lead to increasing rate of new peat growth, which could affect future carbon sink/source strength of the system.

AB The habitat of low growing, herbaceous rich-fen vegetation (Caricion davallianae) is now threatened throughout Western Europe. Its conservation, restoration and even recreation receives increasing attention. In the Campine area of Belgium a rich fen, that depends entirely on an artificial river water infiltration system for its alkaline discharge, is present. The rich fen vegetation cannot be older then a century, i.e. the age of the infiltration system. This illustrates that poor-fen precursors can be transformed into rich fen by alkaline ground-water discharge. The possibilities for restoration and the difficulties with use of allochtonous water for nature conservation are discussed. Finally, the hydrochemical consequences of the alkaline discharge in the fen soil are considered: in dry summers periodical acidification of the peat soils occurs.

AB The objective of the study was to determine the origin and to reconstruct the geological evolution of lignites from the Drmno field (Kostolac Basin, Serbia). For this purpose, petrological and organic geochemical analyses were used. Coal from the Drmno field is typical humic coal. Peat-forming vegetation dominated by decay of resistant gymnosperm (coniferous) plants, followed by prokaryotic organisms and angiosperms. The coal forming plants belonged to the gymnosperm families Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Araucariaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Peatification was realised in a neutral to slightly acidic, fresh water environment. Considering that the organic matter of the Drmno lignites was deposited at the same time, in a relatively constant climate, it could be supposed that climate probably had only a small impact on peatification. Therefore, variations in compositions of macerals and biomarkers indicate changes in the water level, due to seasonal drying of the mire, which caused vegetation differences in the palaeoplant communities and changes in the redox conditions (from anoxic to slightly oxic) during peatification. Diagenetic transformations of the organic matter were mainly governed by microbial activity, rather than thermal alteration.

AB 1 A model was developed that simulates the production and decay of annual peat cohorts over time-scales from years to millennia. The model was used to investigate potential effects of environment and litter-quality related parameters on peat accumulation, and to examine how well past changes in net accumulation can be reconstructed from the peat core record.
   2 Sensitivity analysis of the model indicates that the relative ability of different input parameters to increase peat accumulation changed over time. Short-term results, e.g. from litter decomposition studies, therefore cannot be extrapolated to predict peat accumulation over longer time-scales.
   3 In simulations that examined the long-term development of static community types, peat accumulation responded more strongly to water table position in bogs than in fens. In several cases, the relative peat accumulation potential of different community types changed over time.
   4 Successional change (fen to bog) increased or decreased net peat accumulation, depending on the water table of the simulated bog. If succession was accompanied by lowered water tables, modelled peatlands showed a net loss of organic matter over extended periods of time. Effects of decreased litter quality in drier communities were outweighed by decreased productivity and greater decomposition in the thicker acrotelm.
   5 Plots of cumulative organic matter mass vs. age for simulated profiles were often 'concave', as predicted by models that assume continued decomposition of deep peat. However, simulations that involved community change violated the assumptions of such models, and reconstructed actual (net) rates of organic matter accumulation were unreliable in spite of excellent model fits.
   6 Current peat accumulation models often assume that environmental change will affect productivity, but not the botanical composition of peatland communities. Over decadal and centennial time-scales, however, community change will probably play a key role in determining peatland responses to climate change. Results obtained here suggest that interactions between environmental and community-based controls are complex, and their net effect may not be predictable from current data. In order to develop predictive models that work over these time-scales, we need a better understanding of feedback mechanisms between hydrology, community composition, and organic matter accumulation in peatlands.

AB Question: Does blocking of moorland drains increase bog vegetation on blanket peat?
   Location: Two sites with blocked drains and two with unblocked drains on Forsinard Flows National Nature Reserve, Sutherland, UK.
   Methods: Vegetation cover was recorded from 70 locations, with 12 sampling points at different distances (0.5-14.5 m) from moorland drains in each location. Gradients in the cover of species indicative of wet and dry conditions, as well as bog recovery and degradation in relation to distance from drain, were compared from a sample of drains at two sites with blocked drains and two with unblocked drains.
   Results: There was evidence for drain-blocking having a negative effect on vegetation indicative of drier conditions and bog degradation. One of the blocked sites had the lowest values of these indices near to the drain and increasing at greater distances perpendicular from the drain. The two unblocked sites, and the other blocked site, had a contrasting pattern of highest values of these indices close to the drain declining with distance. Cover of species indicative of bog recovery was greater where the drains had been blocked for the longest time.
   Conclusions: In some cases drain-blocking can improve the ecological functioning of blanket bogs by increasing cover of healthy bog vegetation. Further studies into the causes of such variability in restoring vegetation through drain-blocking are needed to aid targeting of peatland restoration projects to areas or methods most likely to be effective.

AB Human influence on bogs, including air pollution, causes changes in vegetation leading to the degradation of an ombrotrophic bog ecosystem into a more uniform transitional mire-like system. We have hypothesized that intensive atmospheric alkaline pollution will cause an increase in water pH and convergence of bryophyte species composition among microforms. We also expected that bog-specific acidophilic species will be replaced by species indigenous to neutral pH habitats. Through GLM and DCA analyses, we found that although natural acidic bogs are more species poor than polluted bogs, the increase in pH can lead to a decrease in bog-specific vegetation. In polluted bogs, the species composition in different bog microforms will become similar; in particular bog-specific Sphagnum mosses will be increasingly replaced by more tolerant brown mosses, particularly in lawns.

AB Effects of agricultural land-use and land-use change on soil organic carbon (SOC) pools play an important role in the mitigation of the global greenhouse effect. To estimate these effects, baseline SOC data for individual regions or countries are needed. The aim of this study was to quantify current SOC stocks in Swiss agricultural soils, to identify meaningful predictors for SOC, and to estimate historical SOC losses. SOC stocks in mineral soils were estimated from combined georeferenced data for land-use, topography, and profile data (n = 544) from Soil Surveys. Mean SOC density in the layer 0-20 cm ranged between 40.6 +/- 8.9 t ha(-1) (+/-95% confidence interval (CI)) for arable land and 50.7 +/- 12.2 t ha(-1) for favourable permanent grassland, and in the layer 0-100 cm front 62.9 +/- 15.2 t ha(-1) for Unfavourable grassland to 117.4 +/- 29.8 t ha(-1) for temporary Grasslands (leys). SOC stocks in organic soils were quantified separately for intact and cultivated peatlands using data from peatland inventories and Current SOC densities calculated from average peat decay rates. Organic soils account for less than 3% of the total area but store about 28% (47.2 +/- 7.3 Mt) of the total SOC stock of 170 +/- 17 Mt. Land-use type, clay content, and altitude (serving as a climate proxy for grassland soils at higher altitudes) were identified as main SOC predictors in mineral soils. Clay content explained up to 44% of the variability in SOC concentrations in the fine earth of arable soils, but was not significantly related to SOC in grassland soils at higher altitudes. SOC concentration under permanent grassland increases linearly with altitude, but because soil depth and stone content limit carbon storage in alpine grassland soils, no relationship was found between altitude and SOC stock. A preliminary estimate suggested that about 16% of the national SOC stock has been lost historically due to peatland cultivation, urbanisation, and deforestation. It seems unlikely that future changes in agricultural practices could compensate for this historical SOC loss in Swiss agricultural soils. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of scale and temporal variation in measured environmental factors is often underestimated in searching for vegetation-environmental correlations in mires. Since different ecological processes can be dominant at different spatial scales, we compared species distribution patterns along environmental gradients in Carpathian spring fens at two scales: among and within vegetation types. At the large scale, four distinct vegetation types along the poor-rich fen gradient were identified: poor Sphagnum fen, moderate-rich fen, extreme-rich tufa-forming fen and rich fen meadow. The results confirm that environmental factors related to water and soil mineral concentrations determine fen vegetation composition at a large spatial scale. The crucial role of base saturation for large-scale variation in mire vegetation is not always evident at a smaller spatial scale. At a within-vegetation-type scale, we found a clear pattern in water level variation which was significantly related to vegetation composition. Organic matter was detected to be the most important factor for explaining variation in rich-fen meadow vegetation. Further, periodical measurements of water level and physical-chemical properties of water (i.e. pH, conductivity, redox potential, and temperature) permitted the role of their temporal variation among vegetation types along the poor-rich fen gradient to be assessed. Water pH was the most stable variable in all vegetation types, while conductivity was more stable in the rich than in the poor and moderate-rich fens. Water temperature showed the smallest fluctuation in the extreme-rich fen. In poor and moderate-rich fens, water temperature exhibited smaller temporal variation than did conductivity. Poor and moderate-rich fens generally exhibited a lower mean water level as compared with extreme-rich habitats. Independently of vegetation type, water level decline was associated with an increase in conductivity and temperature and a parallel decrease in redox-potential. Water pH remained unchanged during water level fluctuation.

AB Nitrogen (N) pollution from industry and intensive agriculture is one of the greatest threats to ecosystems globally. Peatland ecosystems are particularly sensitive to atmospheric pollution and Great Britain has both extensive peatlands and high levels of nitrogen deposition. This study combines data from national pollutant deposition models, hind-casting factors and projections of future deposition with survey-based mire vegetation data to quantify the nitrogen deposition exposure of different vegetation communities and how this has changed over time. By sub-dividing a wide range of diverse peatland habitats the results give a more nuanced picture of N deposition to peatlands than has previously been possible. Grid cells containing mire vegetation receive an average of 14.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (decade to 2010) and have received an average cumulative deposition of 1312 kg N ha-1 since 1900. The lower limit of the critical load range is exceeded for 69.6 % of cells, but deposition levels and potential for consequent harm vary widely across Britain and between vegetation types. Nitrogen deposition to peatlands is currently falling and is projected to continue to fall until 2020 but with relatively little further change by 2030. N is likely to continue to accumulate in British peats for at least the first three decades of the 21st Century. It is clear that N deposition is currently a serious threat to British peatlands and is likely to remain so for some time to come.

AB In peatlands the reduced decomposition rate of plant litter is the fundamental mechanism making these peat-accumulating ecosystems effective carbon sinks. A better knowledge of litter decomposition and nutrient cycling is thus crucial to improve our predictions of the effects of anthropogenic perturbation on the capacity of peatlands to continue to behave as carbon sinks. We investigated patterns of plant litter decomposition and nutrient release along a minerotrophic-ombrotrophic gradient in a bog on the south-eastern Alps of Italy. We determined mass loss as well as P, N, K, and C release of seven vascular plant species and four moss species after I year in both native and transplanted habitats. Hence, differences in litter decay were supposed to reflect the degree of adaptability of microbial communities to litter quality. Polyphenols/nutrient and C/nutrient quotients appeared as the main parameters accounting for decomposition rates of Sphagnum litter. In particular, litter of minerotrophic Sphagnum species decomposed always faster than litter of ombrotrophic Sphagnum species, both in native and transplanted habitats. Decomposition rates of vascular plant litter in native habitats were always higher than the corresponding mass loss rates of Sphagnum litter. Minerotrophic forbs showed the fastest decomposition both in native and transplanted habitats in accordance with low C/P and C/N litter quotients. On the other hand, C/P quotient seems to play a primary role also in controlling decomposition of graminoids. Decomposition of deciduous and evergreen shrubs was negatively related to their high lignin content. Nitrogen release from Sphagnum litter was primarily controlled by C/N quotient, so that minerotrophic Sphagnum litter released more N than ombrotrophic Sphagnum litter. Overall, we observed slower N release from litter of ombrotrophic vascular plant species compared to minerotrophic vascular plant species. No single chemical parameter could predict the variability associated with different functional groups. The release of K was very high compared to all the other nutrients and rather similar between ombrotrophic and minerotrophic litter types. In Sphagnum litter, a higher C/P quotient was associated with a slower P mineralisation, whereas a faster P release from vascular plant litter seems primarily associated with lower C/P and polyphenols/P quotients.

AB Four small mires, located at an altitude of 1520 in in the forest complex-of Elatia, western Rhodope Massif, northern Greece, were examined in terms of shape, physical and chemical features, plant communities, hydrologic regime, geotectonic setting, and developmental history. The data suggest that the terms bog or fen cannot strictly describe the mires. The mixed vegetation cover of both bog and fen species, the water supply regime (meteoric and surface), the low electrical conductivity, the slightly acidic to sub-neutral pH values, and the high ash contents support the notion that the mixes at Elatia forest can be initially classified as transitional mixes. This term is for the first time attributed to mires in Greece. Peat deposition at one of the sites was initiated c. 2,380 years ago but was intermittent to the present day.

AB The chemical components in water, and changes thereof, can control the ecology of peatlands and impact the accumulation of peat; while at the same time ecological characteristics, hydrology and interactions with the atmosphere and geosphere control peatland water chemistry. This review summarizes results from Canadian and northern European research published over the past two decades for major and minor, inorganic and organic constituents dissolved in surface or pore waters associated with bogs and fens. First those studies that describe natural peatlands are discussed, followed by those that involve peatlands that are disturbed by various direct or indirect anthropogenic influences. Finally several recommendations are made regarding future studies and how they can assist in modelling efforts that can inform peatland management and further scientific inquiry.

AB Aims: Phytosociological classification of fen vegetation (Scheuchzerio palustris-Caricetea fuscae class) differs among European countries. Here we propose a unified vegetation classification of European fens at the alliance level, provide unequivocal assignment rules for individual vegetation plots, identify diagnostic species of fen alliances, and map their distribution.
   Location: Europe, western Siberia and SE Greenland.
   Methods: 29 049 vegetation-plot records of fens were selected from databases using a list of specialist fen species. Formal definitions of alliances were created using the presence, absence and abundance of Cocktail-based species groups and indicator species. DCA visualized the similarities among the alliances in an ordination space. The ISOPAM classification algorithm was applied to regional subsets with homogeneous plot size to check whether the classification based on formal definitions matches the results of unsupervised classifications.
   Results: The following alliances were defined: Caricion viridulo-trinervis (sub-halophytic Atlantic dune-slack fens), Caricion davallianae (temperate calcareous fens), Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis (arcto-alpine calcareous fens), Stygio-Caricion limosae (boreal topogenic brown-moss fens), Sphagno warnstorfii-Tomentypnion nitentis (Sphagnum-brown-moss rich fens), Saxifrago-Tomentypnion (continental to boreo-continental nitrogen-limited brown-moss rich fens), Narthecion scardici (alpine fens with Balkan endemics), Caricion stantis (arctic brown-moss rich fens), Anagallido tenellae-Juncion bulbosi (Ibero-Atlantic moderately rich fens), Drepanocladion exannulati (arcto-boreal-alpine non-calcareous fens), Caricion fuscae (temperate moderately rich fens), Sphagno-Caricion canescentis (poor fens) and Scheuchzerion palustris (dystrophic hollows). The main variation in the species composition of European fens reflected site chemistry (pH, mineral richness) and sorted the plots from calcareous and extremely rich fens, through rich and moderately rich fens, to poor fens and dystrophic hollows. ISOPAM classified regional subsets according to this gradient, supporting the ecological meaningfulness of this classification concept on both the regional and continental scale. Geographic/macroclimatic variation was reflected in the second most important gradient.
   Conclusions: The pan-European classification of fen vegetation was proposed and supported by the data for the first time. Formal definitions developed here allow consistent and unequivocal assignment of individual vegetation plots to fen alliances at the continental scale.

TI Formation and decay of peat bogs in the vegetable belt of Switzerland

DE Landscape evolution; Mire degradation; C-losses; Holocene;
   Sedimentation; Land-use change
AB The rapidly collapsing glacial systems of the Alps produced a large number of melt-water lakes and mires after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Late Glacial period. The Rhone-Aare-glacier system gave rise to large moorlands and lakes in the region of the Three Lakes Region of Western Switzerland. When moorlands are formed, they are efficient sinks of atmospheric carbon, but when transformed to agricultural land they are significant C sources. In addition, mires can be used as archives for reconstructing landscape evolution. We explored in more detail the dynamics of the landscape of the Three Lakes Region with a particular focus on the formation and degradation of mires. The Bernese part of the Three Lakes Region developed to become-after the optimisation of the water-levels of the Swiss Jura-the vegetable belt of Switzerland. The situation for agriculture, however, has now become critical due to an overexploitation of the peatland. Until c. 13 ka BP the entire region was hydrologically connected. An additional lake existed at the western end of the plain receiving sediments from the Aare river. Around 13 ka BP, this lake was isolated from the Aare river and completely silted up until c. 10 ka BP when a mire started to form. In the valley floor ('Grosses Moos'), the meandering Aare and the varying level of the nearby lake of Neuchatel caused a spatio-temporally patchy formation of mires (start of formation: 10-3 ka BP). Strong morphodynamics having high erosion and sedimentation rates and a high variability of the chemical composition of the deposited material prevailed during the early Holocene until c. 7.5 ka BP. The situation remained relatively quiet between 5 and 2 ka BP. However, during the last 2000 years the hydrodynamic and geomorphic activities have increased again. The optimisation of the Swiss Jura water-levels during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries enabled the transformation of moorland into arable land. As a consequence, the moorland strongly degraded. Mean annual C-losses in agricultural land are c. 4.9 t ha(-1) and c. 2.4 t ha(-1) in forests. Because forests limit, but not stop, the degradation of mires, agroforestry might be tested and propagated in future as alternative land-use systems for such sensitive areas.

AB Global warming and the resultant increase in evapotranspiration might lead to lowered water tables in peatlands and an increase in fire frequency. The objective of this study was to investigate some of the potential effects of these changes on peat decomposition. Dry mass losses and emissions of CO2 and CH4 from peat samples taken from three depth layers (0-10, 10-20, and 30-40 cm) of a black spruce peatland were measured in the laboratory at 8-degrees, 16-degrees, and 24-degrees-C under two moisture treatments. Effects of deep peat fire on decomposition were also simulated by burning the upper layer (0-10 cm) of peat and adding the ash to peat samples from the 10-20 cm layer. CH4 release averaged < 1% of total carbon loss in flooded samples. Release of CO2 was 4-9 times greater from the 0-10 cm layer than from the 30-40 cm layer. After 120 d, the 30-40 cm layer had lost < 1% of its original dry mass in all treatments. Higher temperatures strongly promoted decomposition of samples exposed to drying cycles but had little effect on decomposition of continuously flooded samples. Ash addition had variable effects on CO2 emissions but may have promoted CH4 production.
   It is suggested that in certain situations, global warming may not cause appreciable increases in carbon loss from peat deposits. The results indicate that some deeper peats are resistant to decay even when exposed to warm, aerobic conditions. However, further experimental work is needed to predict the long-term response of peat deposits to changes in water levels in different peatland types.

AB Two strains of subdivision 1 Acidobacteria, a pink-pigmented bacterium KA1(T) and a colourless isolate WH120(T), were obtained from acidic Sphagnum peat and wood under decay by the white-rot fungus Hyploma fasciculare, respectively. Cells of these isolates were Gram-negative-staining, non-motile, short rods, which were covered by large polysaccharide capsules and occurred singly, in pairs, or in short chains. Strains KA1(T) and WH120(T) were strictly aerobic mesophiles that grew between 10 and 33 degrees C, with an optimum at 22-28 degrees C. Both isolates developed under acidic conditions, but strain WH120(T) was more acidophilic (pH growth range 3.5-6.4; optimum, 4.0-4.5) than strain KA1(T) (pH growth range 3.5-7.3; optimum, 5.0-5.5). The preferred growth substrates were sugars. In addition, the wood-derived isolate WH120(T) grew on oxalate, lactate and xylan, while the peat-inhabiting acidobacterium strain KA1(T) utilized galacturonate, glucuronate and pectin. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-17:1 omega 8c; the cells also contained significant amounts of 13,16-dimethyl octacosanedioic acid. The quinone was MK-8. The DNA G + C contents of strains KA1(T) and WH120(T) were 54.1 and 51.7 mol%, respectively. Strains KA1(T) and WH120(T) displayed 97.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to each other. The closest recognized relatives were Acidobacterium capsulatum and Telmatobacter bradus (93.4-94.3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). These species differed from strains KA1(T) and WH120(T) by their ability to grow under anoxic conditions, the absence of capsules, presence of cell motility and differing fatty acid composition. Based on these differences, the two new isolates are proposed as representing a novel genus, Acidicapsa gen. nov., and two novel species. Acidicapsa borealis gen. nov., sp. nov. is the type species for the new genus with strain KA1(T) (=DSM 23886(T)=LMG 25897(T)=VKM B-2678(T)) as the type strain. The name Acidicapsa ligni sp. nov. is proposed for strain WH120(T) (=LMG 26244(T)=VKM B-2677(T)=NCCB 100371(T)).

DE FEN VEGETATION; SUCCESSION; WATER CYCLE; BASE STATE; NUTRIENT STATE;
   CONSERVATION
AB A survey of base-rich wetlands in The Netherlands is presented. The main area of their occurrence is the low-lying Holocene part of the country, until some thousand years ago a large and coherent wetland landscape: the Holland wetland. The development of various parts of the Holland wetland into marshes, fens and bogs can be understood from hydrological relations in mire basins, as recognized in the distinction of primary, secondary and tertiary mire basin stages. Presently, the remnants of the Holland wetland are separate base-rich wetlands. The succession of their vegetation reflects various abiotic conditions and human influences. Three main developmental periods are distinguished as regards these factors. The first, geological period of mire development is seen as a post-glacial relaxation, with the inertia due to the considerable mass of wetland as a stabilizing factor. Biological ''grazing'' influences, as an aspect of utilization by humans, converted base-rich wetlands to whole new types in the second, historical period. Presently, mass and harvesting have decreased in importance, and actual successions in terrestrializing turbaries seem to reflect rapidly changing environmental conditions. Human control could well become the most important factor in the future development of wetland nature. The present value of open fen vegetation strongly depends on the continuation of the historical harvesting. The development of wooded fen may help to increase the mass of wetland in the future. Best results in terms of biodiversity are expected when their base state is maintained through water management.
   The vegetation and hydrology of floating fens in terrestrializing turbaries is treated in some more detail. Various lines and phases in the succession are distinguished. Open fen vegetation at base-rich, yet nutrient-poor sites is very rich in species threatened elsewhere. The fast acidification of certain such fens is attributed to hydrological and management factors. This acidification is illustrated in the profile of a floating raft sample. At the scale of these small fens, the elemental structure comprising base-rich fen, transitional fen and bog vegetation, is not as stable as it was in the large Holland wetland. A critical role seems to be played by the supply of bases with the water influx. The changing base state is supposed to change the nutrient cycling to such an extent that it would be correct to call this trophic excitation of the ecosystem, rather than just eutrophication. Eutrophication indicates a quantitative reaction to an increased nutrient supply, the internal system being unaltered. The drainage of fens, resulting in an increased productivity of the vegetation, provides another example of excitation, to the effect that the functional system is dramatically changed internally.

AB The hydrochemistry of 26 small blanket bog lakes was examined to assess the impact of conifer plantation forestry on lake water chemistry. Lakes were selected from three distinct catchment land use categories: i) unplanted blanket bog only present in the catchment, ii) mature (closed-canopy) conifer plantation forests only present in the catchment and iii) catchments containing mature conifer plantation forests with recently clearfelled areas. All three catchment land uses were replicated across two geologies: sedimentary (sandstone) and igneous (granite). Lakes with afforested catchments across both geologies had elevated concentrations of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), total dissolved organic carbon (TDOC), aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe), with the highest concentrations of each parameter recorded from lakes with catchment clearfelling. Dissolved oxygen was also significantly reduced in the afforested lakes, particularly the clearfell lakes. Analysis of runoff from a nearby recently clearfelled site revealed high biological and chemical oxygen demands, consistent with at least part of the elevated concentrations of TDOC emanating from clearfelled sites having higher biochemical lability. Inorganic fertilisers applied at the start of the forest cycle, the decay of the underlying peat soil and accumulated surface tree litter, and leachate from felled trees are the likely sources of the elevated concentrations of plant nutrients, TDOC, heavy metals and major ions, with excessive peat soil disturbance during clearfelling likely exacerbating the runoff into lakes. Our study has demonstrated a clear, deleterious impact of conifer plantations on the water quality draining from blanket bog catchments, with major implications for the management of afforested peatlands.

AB Substantial deposits of peat have accumulated since the last glacial. Since peat accumulation rates are rather low, this process was previously neglected in carbon cycle models. For assessments of the global carbon cycle on millennial or even longer timescales, though, the carbon storage in peat cannot be neglected any more. We have therefore developed a dynamic model of wetland extent and peat accumulation in order to assess the influence of peat accumulation on the global carbon cycle.
   The model is based on the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ and consists of a wetland module and routines describing the accumulation and decay of peat. The wetland module, based on the TOPMODEL approach, dynamically determines inundated area and water table, which change depending on climate. Not all temporarily inundated areas accumulate peat, though, but peat accumulates in permanently inundated areas with rather stable water table position. Peatland area therefore is highly uncertain, and we perform sensitivity experiments to cover the uncertainty range for peatland extent. The peat module describes oxic and anoxic decomposition of organic matter in the acrotelm, i.e., the part of the peat column above the permanent water table, as well as anoxic decomposition in the catotelm, the peat below the summer minimum water table.
   We apply the model to the period of the last 8000 years, during which the model accumulates 330 PgC as catotelm peat in the peatland areas north of 40 degrees N, with an uncertainty range from 240 PgC to 490 PgC. This falls well within the range of published estimates for the total peat storage in high northern latitudes, considering the fact that these usually cover the total carbon accumulated, not just the last 8000 years we considered in our model experiments. In the model, peat primarily accumulates in Scandinavia and eastern Canada, though eastern Europe and north-western Russia also show substantial accumulation. Modelled wetland distribution is biased towards Eurasia, where inundated area is overestimated, while it is underestimated in North America. Latitudinal sums compare favourably to measurements, though, implying that total areas, as well as climatic conditions in these areas, are captured reasonably, though the exact positions of peatlands are not modelled well. Since modelling the initiation of peatland growth requires a knowledge of topography below peat deposits, the temporal development of peatlands is not modelled explicitly, therefore overestimating peatland extent during the earlier part of our experiments.
   Overall our results highlight the substantial amounts of carbon taken up by peatlands during the last 8000 years. This uptake would have substantial impacts on the global carbon cycle and therefore cannot be neglected.

AB The zonation of depressional and riparian wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain of northeastern China was studied to describe their vegetation composition and environmental variables. We sampled 108 plots in 6 depression and riparian wetlands. Samples were classified into 4 groups using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Emergent marsh vegetation was characterized by Carex lasiocarpa and C. pseudocuraica, meadow marsh vegetation by tussock species such as Carex appendiculata and C. meyeriana, wet meadow vegetation by Calamangrostis angustifolia and Carex appendiculata, and shrub meadow vegetation by the shrubs Betula fruticosa, Alnus sibirica and Salix rosmarinifolia and the graminids Carex schmidtii and Calamagrostis angustifolia. CCA ordination showed that water table, organic matter and available N were the major factors explaining the vegetation zonation pattern. Compared with other Northern Hemisphere regions, bog and fen vegetation are completely absent due to climatic conditions unfavorable for peat formation. Out of four vegetation types, only the Carex lasiocarpa community and the C. pseudo-curaica community have been found in other regions. However, at the species level many species are widespread and some species are vicariant or pseudovicariant to other regions in the world. Our study suggests that topography and hydrology may be the most important determinants of the vegetation pattern in this region.

AB Aims: To classify and characterize montane mires and deduce management strategies based on their current state and long-term development. Location: Kleinwalsertal, Austria. Methods: Vascular plants and bryophytes were recorded in a field study of 274 releves. Abiotic parameters (groundwater dynamics, water and soil characteristics) were measured at 35 sites. Macro-remain analyses of 42 soil profiles were used to reconstruct the long-term development of mires. Vegetation was differentiated by using conventional (Braun-Blanquet) and multivariate methods (Cluster analysis, Ordination). A combination of hydrogenetic criteria, chemical composition of peat and soil water, botanical composition of peat and current vegetation was applied to classify mire types. Results: Eight vegetation types were delimited and characterized pertaining to their ecological conditions. An acidity-alkalinity gradient was documented for the different vegetation types. Hydrological data indicated differences in human impact on mires. All transitions between soligenous, ombro-soligenous and ombrogenous mires were found along transects including shallow bogs on hilltops via base-rich fens on slopes, to transition mires at the onset and deeper bogs in the center of terraces. Analysis of short and long-term successional processes revealed that this sequence of mire types has been affected by human impacts at many locations. Thus, the discharge of base-rich subsurface water at the base of hillsides by ditches caused a) the ombrotrophication of transition mires and the expansion of secondary bog vegetation in the terraces and b) the development of straw meadows (Molinion) or wet meadows (Calthion) on the slopes at the expense of base-rich fens (Caricion davallianae). The increasing abandonment of species-rich fens is a problem for nature conservation. Conclusions: The analysis of vegetation development on various temporal scales is helpful to define restoration targets. In the study area, management should focus predominately on restoring the typical hydrology of mires and maintaining biodiversity of fen meadows by mowing or grazing.

AB 1The vertical and horizontal dynamics of peat carbon accumulation in Ruosuo aapa mire, north-central Finland, were investigated in an attempt to understand variations in carbon accumulation over time.
   2 Paludification began around 8700 BP (9600 cal BP). The long-term net carbon accumulation rate, based on vertical and lateral growth, was 8.0 g C m(-2) year(-1). Variations in carbon accumulation rates can be explained to a great extent by natural succession and variations in local conditions, but the role of climate cannot be ignored.
   3 The marked decline in carbon accumulation rates after 6100 BP (7000 cal BP) may indicate a relatively dry and warm climate. The levelling out and subsequent increase in carbon accumulation rates after 4000 BP (4500 cal BP) indicates the development of a cooler and moister climate.
   4 The low long-term net carbon accumulation rate and the high carbon content per unit volume in the layer underlying the surficial peat is typical for a wet aapa mire. The continuous penetration of roots, mostly sedge, results in carbon input into the underlying peat layer and contributes to the intensive decay of the surficial peat due to high biological activity.
   5 Although one-third of the apparent carbon has accumulated during the last 2000 years, most of Ruosuo is approaching the stage where primary production does not adequately compensate for overall carbon loss. The declining net carbon accumulation rates from the base up to the depth of 80 cm may indicate a real delayed trend in net carbon accumulation rates.
   6 We suggest that under the present climatic conditions the northern circumpolar wet mires are significant sources of greenhouse gases. In addition to high methane production, northern aapa mires also have lower carbon accumulation rates than more southern raised bogs.
   7 Our results, which are based on horizontal and vertical carbon accumulation rates, suggest that the earlier published carbon accumulation rates in Finnish aapa mires are overestimated.

AB Artificial drainage (ditching) is widely used to increase timber yield in northern forests. When the drainage systems are maintained, their environmental impacts are likely to accumulate over time and along accompanying management, notably after logging when new forest develops on decayed peat. Our study provides the first comprehensive documentation of long-term ditching impacts on terrestrial and arboreal biodiversity by comparing natural alder swamps and second-generation drained forests that have evolved from such swamps in Estonia. We explored species composition of four potentially drainage-sensitive taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, and snails), abundance of species of conservation concern, and their relationships with stand structure in two-ha plots representing four management types (ranging from old growth to clearcut). We found that drainage affected plot-scale species richness only weakly but it profoundly changed assemblage composition. Bryophytes and lichens were the taxonomic groups that were most sensitive both to drainage and timber-harvesting; in closed stands they responded to changed microhabitat structure, notably impoverished tree diversity and dead-wood supply. As a result, natural old-growth plots were the most species-rich and hosted several specific species of conservation concern. Because the most influential structural changes are slow, drainage impacts may be long hidden. The results also indicated that even very old drained stands do not provide quality habitats for old-growth species of drier forest types. However, drained forests hosted many threatened species that were less site type specific, including early-successional vascular plants and snails on clearcuts and retention cuts, and bryophytes and lichens of successional and old forests. We conclude that three types of specific science-based management tools are needed to mitigate ditching effects on forest biodiversity: (i) silvicultural techniques to maintain stand structural complexity; (ii) context-dependent spatial analysis and planning of drained landscapes; and (iii) lists of focal species to monitor and guide ditching practices.

TI Peat deposits store more carbon than trees in forested peatlands of the
   boreal biome
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Peatlands are significant carbon (C) stores, playing a key role in nature-based climate change mitigation. While the effectiveness of non-forested peatlands as C reservoirs is increasingly recognized, the C sequestration function of forested peatlands remains poorly documented, despite their widespread distribution. Here, we evaluate the C sequestration potential of pristine boreal forested peatlands over both recent and millennial timescales. C stock estimates reveal that most of the carbon stored in these ecosystems is found in organic horizons (22.6-66.0 kg m(-2)), whereas tree C mass (2.8-5.7 kg m(-2)) decreases with thickening peat. For the first time, we compare the boreal C storage capacities of peat layers and tree biomass on the same timescale, showing that organic horizons (11.0-12.6 kg m(-2)) can store more carbon than tree aboveground and belowground biomass (2.8-5.7 kg m(-2)) even over a short time period (last 200 years). We also show that forested peatlands have similar recent rates of C accumulation to boreal non-forested peatlands but lower long-term rates, suggesting higher decay and more important peat layer combustion during fire events. Our findings highlight the significance of forested peatlands for C sequestration and suggest that greater consideration should be given to peat C stores in national greenhouse gas inventories and conservation policies.

AB Actual ecological research postulates for alder carrs a cyclic alternation of Alnus tree vegetation with open fen or Salix dominated vegetation. Such cycles are also indicated in palaeo-ecological studies, but normally the temporal resolution of these studies is insufficient to resolve the duration of short-term cycles in vegetation development. This paper presents a high resolution palaeoecological study (including pollen, macrofossils and non-pollen palynomorphs) of a Late Holocene wood peat section from the small, long-term Alnus dominated peatland 'Heger Soll' in the 'Rodder Forst' in Western Pomerania (NE Germany) to reconstruct short-term vegetation changes. During a time-span of ca. 800 years, sedge-dominated fen vegetation types alternated with two phases of Alnus carr and one phase of Salix shrubland. The alder carr decline coincided with the beginning of intensified human activity in the surroundings of the mire and was probably connected to increased water discharge resulting from large-scale deforestation, after which willow scrub and sedge fen became established. Growth of Alnus trees was associated with prolonged phases of reduced human impact and probably less water supply. This study shows that human impact on the uplands surrounding the mire and on the alder carr itself may explain the observed "cyclic" vegetation development of alder carrs, willow scrubs and sedge fens in Central Europe.

AB Mire surface levels reflecting the water table depth are known to be an important vegetation gradient in boreal peatlands. We classified the vegetation by TWINSPAN, interpreted the vegetation gradients by ordination (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) and analysed the peat thickness for the TWINSPAN communities and species (Indicator Species Analysis) from small-sized sample plots over extremely thin-peated to medium thick-peated, minerotrophic mire expanse vegetation from an aapa-mire complex Hirvisuo, Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. The TWINSPAN communities and the ordination-result could be interpreted in relation to the mire surface levels and additionally in relation to the stability of the water regime on the basis of water level measurements made from the same habitat types in an earlier research. Peat thickness correlated with the stability of the water regime so that communities with an unstable water regime on sand were thin-peated (0-30 cm), while communities with a stable water regime were more thick-peated. We conclude here that the mire-ecological water-table gradient was dissected into two vegetation gradients in Hirvisuo: the gradient formed by mire surface levels reflecting the mean water table level and the stability of the water regime, which represents a gradient of local importance over boreal Fennoscandia. Peat procuding ability of the bottom layer in mires seems to be much dependent on it.

AB Well-preserved, late Visean miospore assemblages from the coastline south of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, UK, show a sequence of palynostratigraphic events stretching from the mid Asbian to the Brigantian. The assemblages belong to the Raistrickia nigra-Triquitrites marginatus (NM) and Tripartites vetustus-Rotaspora fracta (VF) biozones. Several taxa previously only recorded from pre-Brigantian strata (including Murospora parthenopia and Verrucosisporites eximius) are recorded from Brigantian rocks. The section is composed of "Yoredale" cycles reflecting cyclical changes in sea level. These features exerted control over the distribution of miospores in the section with notable trends in the vertical distributions of miospores indicative of forest mire and colonizer vegetation. Miospores representing forest mire vegetation dominate in coarser-grained rocks deposited in more proximal environments and have similar distribution patterns to rounded-triangular miospores. Conversely, non-forest mire vegetation is better represented in more proximal depositional settings, as are rounded-triangular miospores. Some samples contain mutated examples of the miospore Tripartites vetustus Schemel 1950. Mutagenesis is probably related to some, unspecified ecological stress. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bog ecosystems fulfil important functions in Earth's carbon and water turnover. While plant communities and their keystone species Sphagnum have been well studied, less is known about the microbial communities associated with them. To study our hypothesis that bog plants share an essential core of their microbiome despite their different phylogenetic origins, we analysed four plant community plots with 24 bryophytes, vascular plants and lichen species in two Alpine bogs in Austria by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing followed by bioinformatic analyses. The overall bog microbiome was classified into 32 microbial phyla, while Proteobacteria (30.8%), Verrucomicrobia (20.3%) and Planctomycetes (15.1%) belonged to the most abundant groups. Interestingly, the archaeal phylum Euryarcheota represented 7.2% of total microbial abundance. However, a high portion of micro-organisms remained unassigned at phylum and class level, respectively. The core microbiome of the bog vegetation contained 177 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (150 526 seq.) and contributed to 49.5% of the total microbial abundance. Only a minor portion of associated core micro-organisms was host specific for examined plant groups (5.9-11.6%). Using our new approach to analyse plant-microbial communities in an integral framework of ecosystem, vegetation and microbiome, we demonstrated that bog vegetation harboured a core microbiome that is shared between plants and lichens over the whole ecosystem and formed a transkingdom metacommunity. All micro-and macro-organisms are connected to keystone Sphagnum mosses via set of microbial species, for example Burkholderia bryophila which was found associated with a wide spectrum of host plants and is known for a beneficial plant-microbe interaction.

AB Peatlands act as global sinks of atmospheric carbon (C) through the accumulation of organic matter(1), primarily made up of decay-resistant litter of peat mosses(2). However, climate warming has been shown to promote vascular plant growth in peatlands, especially ericaceous shrubs(3). A change in vegetation cover is in turn expected to modify above-ground/below-ground interactions(4), but the biogeochemical mechanisms involved remain unknown. Here, by selecting peatlands at different altitudes to simulate a natural gradient of soil temperature, we show that the expansion of ericaceous shrubs with warming is associated with an increase of polyphenol content in both plant litter and pore water. In turn, this retards the release of nitrogen (N) from decomposing litter, increases the amount of dissolved organic N and reduces N immobilization by soil microbes. A decrease of soil water content with increasing temperature promotes the growth of fungi, which feeds back positively on ericaceous shrubs by facilitating the symbiotic acquisition of dissolved organic N. We also observed a higher release of labile C from vascular plant roots at higher soil temperatures, which promotes the microbial investment in C-degrading enzymes. Our data suggest that climate-induced changes in plant cover can reduce the productivity of peat mosses and potentially prime the decomposition of organic matter by affecting the stoichiometry of soil enzymatic activity.

AB PAH concentration and distribution has been examined in surface sediments samples from the Kara Sea, Russia. The study includes 13 samples from the South-eastern Kara Sea shelf, one sample from the south-western part of the sea, 4 samples from the Baydaratskaya Bay, 5 samples from the Gulf of Ob and 4 samples from the Yenisei Bay, collected in August-September 1993-1994. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to identify common patterns and possible sources of PAHs. The total PAH concentration (sum of two- to six-ring aromatic hydrocarbons) in the Kara Sea sediments was generally lower than. in the Barents Sea sediments and comparable to the levels in the Pechora and White seas. Two- and three-ring aromatic hydrocarbons predominated in Kara Sea sediments, which indicate a relatively stronger petrogenic origin than that in the adjacent seas. The highest total PAH concentrations within the Kara Sea were found in sediments from the Yenisei Bay and in the South-westem part of the Kara Sea in the Eastern Novaya Zemlya Trough. The PAHs of the Yenisei Bay sediments were dominated by perylene and PAHs of petrogenic origin, but had also a strong indication of PAHs of pyrogenic origin. The dominating PAH group in the South-westem part of the Kara Sea were four- to six-ring aromatic hydrocarbons, indicating pyrogenic origin. Perylene levels were high in all the Kara Sea samples, and highest levels were found in areas of strong terrigenous influence. The most probable source is decaying peat products being transported to the Kara Sea by both large and small rivers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Under changing climatic conditions permafrost peatlands can play an important role in the global carbon budget through permafrost carbon feedbacks and shifts in carbon assimilation. To better predict future dynamics in these ecosystems an increased understanding of their Holocene carbon and permafrost history is needed. In Tavvavuoma, northern Sweden, we have performed detailed analyses of vegetation succession and geochemical properties at six permafrost peatland sites. Peatland initiation took place around 10000 to 9600cal. a BP, soon after retreat of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, and the peatlands have remained permafrost-free fens throughout most of the Holocene. At the four sites that showed a continuous accumulation record during the late Holocene radiocarbon dating of the shift from wet fen to dry bog vegetation, characteristic of the present permafrost peatland surface, suggests that permafrost developed at around 600-100cal. a BP. At the other two sites peat accumulation was halted during the late Holocene, possibly due to abrasion, making it more difficult to imply the timing of permafrost aggradation. However also at these sites there are no indications of permafrost inception prior to the Little Ice Age. The mean long-term Holocene carbon accumulation rate at all six sites was 12.3 +/- 2.4 gC m(-2) a(-1) (+/- SD), and the mean soil organic carbon storage was 114 +/- 27kg m(-2).

AB The vegetation of a well preserved mire in the southern Alps (South Tyrol) was studied and the results were correlated with data concerning hydrology, hydrochemistry and peat chemistry. The different vegetation types showed different nutrient levels both in the water and in the peat. In the hollows, nutrient concentrations were low in the water and higher in the peat. A reverse trend was observed in hummocks. Different patterns of accumulation and removal of mineral elements were observed along the peat profile: concentrations of N and P increase with depth; concentrations of Na, K, Mg and Mn decrease with depth; Fe and Al accumulate in the zone of water-table fluctuation. Two different areas could be distinguished within the mire, based on surface morphology, hydrochemistry and peat chemistry, viz. a peripheral area moderately rich in nutrients and a central area poor in nutrients. The mire cannot be typified as a true bog although the vegetation in its central area has several traits in common with that of raised bogs in boreal regions. We suggest that the limit between ombrotrophic bogs and poor transitional mires is weaker than commonly admitted, especially at the margin of Sphagnum-bog distribution.

AB 1 The historical development of mire ecology and terminology is reviewed in relation to evolving concepts and perceptions, and the diverse schools and traditions of vegetation and habitat description and research.
   2 Most ecological and floristic variation within north-west European mire vegetation is accounted for by three ecological gradients: the acid base-poor vs. neutral, base- and bicarbonate-rich gradient; the gradient in fertility related to availability of the limiting nutrient elements N and P; and the water level gradient. Effects of salinity and the spring-flush-fen gradients are of more local significance, usually easily recognized. Land use is an important additional factor.
   3 The mineral-soil-water limit between ombrotrophic and minerotrophically influenced sites is not sharp, and cannot be related to consistent differences in either vegetation or water chemistry. It should be abandoned as a general main division within mires.
   4 The most important natural division is between 'bog', with pH generally < 5.0, low Ca2+, and Cl- and SO42- as the main inorganic anions, typically dominated by sphagna, ericoids and calcifuge Cyperaceae, and 'fen', with pH generally > 6.0, high Ca2+ and HCO3-, vegetation rich in dicotyledonous herbs and 'brown mosses'. This division is reflected in a bimodal distribution of pH.
   5 The terms oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic should refer only to nutrient richness (fertility, mainly N and P), not to base richness (metallic cations and pH).
   6 It is recommended that 'mire' should embrace both wetlands on peat and related communities on mineral soils, that 'bog' (unqualified) should encompass both ombrotrophic and weakly minerotrophic mires, including 'bog woodland', and that 'fen' should be restricted to base-rich mires but include both herbaceous and wooded vegetation ('fen carr').
   7 Definitions are given for a range of broadly defined categories that should cover most vegetation types commonly encountered. The relation of these to British national vegetation classification types and to major units in European phytosociology is outlined.

AB It remains uncertain how the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of diverse peatlands will respond to warming. Here we compare five years of eddy covariance measurements of NEE and estimates of gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration between a fen dominated by deciduous vegetation and an adjacent bog with evergreen vegetation in the Canadian Hudson Bay Lowlands. At the bog, daily net CO2 uptake lasted from snowmelt to snow cover onset, while at the fen, net CO2 uptake was delayed in spring and ended earlier in fall. Greater midsummer net CO2 uptake at the fen compensated for shoulder season net CO2 losses resulting in similar annual NEE at the two sites (fen: -52 +/- 16 g C m(-2), bog: -80 +/- 14 g C m(-2)). Observations of a satellite-based productivity index also suggest lower shoulder season and higher peak vegetation productivity at these deciduous versus evergreen plant-dominated peatlands. The response of NEE to warmer weather differed between sites. Warming during the shoulder seasons increased net CO2 uptake at the evergreen plant-dominated bog, while it increased net CO2 losses at the fen where deciduous leaves had not yet emerged or had senesced. In contrast, warmer weather during the peak growing season appeared to reduce net CO2 uptake more at the bog than the fen resulting from both increasing ecosystem respiration and decreasing gross primary productivity. In the short term, warming will likely decrease annual net CO2 uptake of these and similar peatlands, although the magnitude will depend on factors including vegetation dynamics and seasonality of warming.

AB Question: Which environmental variables affect the floristic composition of south Patagonian bog vegetation along a gradient of climate and biogeochemical changes with increasing distance from the Pacific ocean?
   Location: Trans-Andean transect (53 degrees S), southern Patagonia
   Material and Methods: Floristic composition, peat characteristics ( water level, decomposition, pH, total nitrogen, total carbon, ash content and plant available P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Al) and climatic constraints of ombrotrophic peatlands were measured at 82 plots along a gradient of increasing distance from the Pacific Ocean.
   Results: Climatic constraints and biogeochemical peat characteristics significantly change with increasing distance from the Pacific. Peatland vegetation shifted from hyperoceanic blanket bogs dominated by cushion forming vascular plants to the west to Sphagnum bogs to the east. Climatic and biogeochemical variables explained a large proportion of the floristic variation along the first DCA axis. The second axis represented a water level gradient. When 'distance to the Pacific' was defined as a covariable in partial CCA, the proportion of variance explained declined for most other variables, especially in the case of annual precipitation and exchangeable base cations and related traits. The differences in biogeochemical characteristics related to peat were mainly attributed to the input of sea-borne cations.
   Conclusions: While variation in vegetation composition along a longitudinal gradient crossing the southern Andes was attributed to climatic constraints as expected, vegetation composition was also strongly affected by the biogeochemical characteristics of peat. Sea spray was of high ecological importance to peat chemistry and, consequently, to floristic composition. Presumably, south Patagonian peat bogs represent a glimpse of pre-industrial environments, so that these peat bogs may act as reference systems with respect to atmospheric inputs in mire ecology research.

AB We present a record of peatland development in relation to climate changes and human activities from the Palomaa mire, a remote site in northern Finland. We used fine-resolution and continuous sampling to analyse several proxies including pollen (for vegetation on and around the mire), testate amoebae (TA; for mire-wetness changes), oxygen and carbon isotopes from Sphagnum cellulose (18O and 13C; for humidity and temperature changes), peat-accumulation rates and peat-colour changes. In spite of an excellent accumulation model (30 14C dates and estimated standard deviation of sample ages <1 year in the most recent part), the potential to determine causeeffect (or leadlag) relationships between environmental changes and biotic responses is limited by proxy-specific incorporation processes below the actively growing Sphagnum surface. Nevertheless, what emerges is that mire development was closely related to water-table changes rather than to summer temperature and that water-table decreases were associated with increasing peat-accumulation rates and more abundant mire vegetation. A rapid fen-to-bog transition occurred within a few years around AD 1960 when the water table decreased beyond the historical minimum, supporting the notion that mires can rapidly shift into bogs in response to allogenic factors.

While post-disturbance succession is well documented for regularly disturbed ecosystems, little is known about the pathways and rapidity of vegetation dynamics after rare events such as peat mass movements in bogs. We monitored the floristic changes in a mire subject to a bog burst in 1987 for two decades through the repeated sampling of permanent plots. The mean species number per plot increased continuously, while the evenness increased only in the first decade and then slightly decreased. Declining species were mostly mire species, while colonist species were mostly wet meadow species. Species turnover was higher in the first decade after the disturbance, and was also higher in the area of peat erosion than in the area of peat accumulation. Changes in plant species composition indicate a succession towards tall-forb vegetation (Filipendulion), acidic fen vegetation (Caricion fuscae) and swamp willow forest (Salicion). We conclude that the effects of the disturbance are still ongoing, and that the mire's potential for recovery is therefore difficult to predict.

AB Studies of spontaneous revegetation in cutaway peatlands with residual fen peat are relatively scarce in Europe. However, knowledge about the spontaneous recovery of vegetation and factors affecting the succession can be applied in wetland restoration and conservation of valuable, threatened habitats and species populations. We analysed spontaneous revegetation and influencing factors in six cutaway fens in Latvia. The results suggest that the major drivers affecting the composition of vegetation in the study sites are water table, soil water pH and time since peat harvesting ceased. Water table is the major variable that distinguishes success from failure in terms of fen recovery, while pH differentiates the outcome: poor fen and rich fen vegetation, together with age, define the 'typicalness' of the plant community. In alkaline conditions the sites can host numerous rare and specialist species. The outcome of self-restoration is site-specific, making the results difficult to generalise.

AB Removal of shrubs and trees is an important management and restoration practice to promote openness and light-dependent vegetation in fens, especially as tree cover is increasing in previously open wetlands. The effects of woody vegetation removal on target species have been poorly documented in wetlands up to now. In this study, I investigated the effect of tree and shrub removal (especially of Juniperus communis) on the target vegetation in a partly overgrown and degraded grazed rich fen after 6 years. I also tested whether additional intensified management by mowing could promote initial recovery. Shrub removal resulted in a rapid recovery of species-rich fen vegetation such that after 6 years brown moss cover more than tripled and target species richness doubled and became similar to values of a reference area in a favorable conservation status. Additional mowing resulted in a much higher abundance of the target rich fen vascular plants. The reasons for the success at this site may be the proximity to well-developed rich fen vegetation, presence of cattle that dispersed diaspores, and presence of bare, colonizable substrate. Thus, it may be more beneficial to restore and expand already existing sites in a partly favorable status than to restore severely deteriorated sites. Extensive management by woody vegetation removal may be an alternative method to maintain high conservation values of open mires and other wetlands, where grazing or mowing is not necessary or feasible to meet future needs in response to overgrowth caused by global warming.

AB Despite their huge extent, the peatlands of Russia are an under-exploited source of data on palaeoenvironmental change. We investigated the Holocene history of Staroselsky Moch, an ombrotrophic peatland in the Tver Region of European Russia by analysis of testate amoebae, peat physical properties, plant macrofossils and pollen. The peatland developed through a classic hydroseral succession in the early Holocene with a sharp decline in mineral input to 6200cal. BC followed by an abrupt transition from fen to bog vegetation around 5500cal. BC. Through the Holocene, the peatland has accumulated carbon at a mean apparent rate of 21.5gCm(-2)yr(-1) suggesting that carbon accumulation rates in peatlands of European Russia lie close to the global average, and contrasting with a short sequence of eddy-covariance data which implies a net loss of carbon. The testate amoeba record shows considerable variability which may be driven by climate, but changes are not well replicated in the macrofossil or pollen data. We tentatively infer (1) a phase of early Holocene warming commencing around 7200cal. BC, (2) dry peatland surface conditions c. 3700-3900cal. BC, (3) a shift to wetter conditions from c. 3900cal. BC, and (4) drier conditions from c. 400cal. BC onwards. More robust and precise hydroclimatic reconstructions for this region will require the development of a regional transfer function and the replication of results between cores and sites.

AB Inhibition of phenol oxidase (PO) activity by low pH is a potential key mechanism to limit decomposition in acidic Sphagnum Mires, but few controlled experiments have been performed. The possible effects of assay pH and of auto-oxidation of the commonly used substrate L-dihydroxy phenylalanine (L-DOPA) have remained unreported. We conducted a series of experiments in order to reveal realistic response of PO activity to the pH gradient, taking into account the possible effects of auto-oxidation and assay pH. We found positive responses to pH with 60-100% increase of PO activity with one pH unit (3.5-4.5). In alkaline solutions, L-DOPA was readily auto-oxidized, which may hamper the use of this reagent with alkaline samples. Adjustment of assay pH resulted in variable responses of PO activity to temperature and sample pH. Combinations of matching sample pH and assay pH consistently showed a positive response of PO activity to pH, indicating that control of assay pH is an essential prerequisite of obtaining realistic results of PO activity. The positive relationship of PO activity and pH indicates that the inhibition of enzymic oxidation of phenolic compounds may contribute to the decay resistance of Sphagnum in acidic mire habitats.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances are important factors structuring the vegetation of ecosystems, but their influence on peatlands remain poorly understood. We quantified the relative influence of anthropogenic disturbances, abiotic variables and spatial patterns on the floristic composition of a large wetland complex, and assessed the relationship between disturbances and species richness. Vegetation and abiotic data were collected in 253 plots, and disturbances determined using aerial photographs. Data were analyzed with multivariate and nonparametric techniques. Disturbances had detrimental effects on bryophyte and on true peatland species richness, but favored the richness of grass as well as non-peatland and exotic species. However, abiotic conditions are still predominant in controlling the overall plant composition at the complex level (25.2% of floristic variations explained, compared to 8.2% for disturbances). The vegetation heterogeneity was also mainly attributed to abiotic factors when taking account only fen habitats. The three sets of explanatory factors were equally important in structuring the vegetation of bog habitats. However, the most influential variables were those related to human activities. Our landscape ecology approach to study wetland vegetation allowed us to show that while human disturbances are important in structuring vegetation in bogs and fens, they do not override the prevalence of local abiotic conditions.

AB Peatlands store approximately 30% of global soil carbon, most in moss-dominated bogs. Future climatic changes, such as changes in precipitation patterns and warming, are expected to affect peat bog vegetation composition and thereby its long-term carbon sequestration capacity. Theoretical work suggests that an episode of rapid environmental change is more likely to trigger transitions to alternative ecosystem states than a gradual, but equally large, change in conditions. We used a dynamic vegetation model to explore the impacts of drought events and increased temperature on vegetation composition of temperate peat bogs. We analyzed the consequences of six patterns of summer drought events combined with five temperature scenarios to test whether an open peat bog dominated by moss (Sphagnum) could shift to a tree-dominated state. Unexpectedly, neither a gradual decrease in the amount of summer precipitation nor the occurrence of a number of extremely dry summers in a row could shift the moss-dominated peat bog permanently into a tree-dominated peat bog. The increase in tree biomass during drought events was unable to trigger positive feedbacks that keep the ecosystem in a tree-dominated state after a return to previous normal' rainfall conditions. In contrast, temperature increases from 1 degrees C onward already shifted peat bogs into tree-dominated ecosystems. In our simulations, drought events facilitated tree establishment, but temperature determined how much tree biomass could develop. Our results suggest that under current climatic conditions, peat bog vegetation is rather resilient to drought events, but very sensitive to temperature increases, indicating that future warming is likely to trigger persistent vegetation shifts.

AB Dendrochronological analyses were conducted across a gradient of productivity and soil drainage quality characterizing four vegetation types in a low-productivity hypermaritime (perhumid) temperate rainforest on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. We examined the structure, composition, and stand dynamics of trees growing in 400 m(2) plots located in blanket bog, bog woodland, bog forest, and zonal forest vegetation types. We sampled over 2500 trees and 1500 seedlings and saplings and our dendrochronological reconstruction of six tree species revealed establishment ages extending to 660 A.D. (1350 yr). All forest plots contained numerous old trees (>250 yr) and the zonal forest and bog forest vegetation types contained significantly taller trees and also had the greatest amount of suppressed, shade-tolerant tree species. The bog woodland vegetation type contained more seedlings and saplings than the other three vegetation types combined. The bog forest vegetation type had the highest density of dead standing trees (similar to 530 per hectare). Blanket bogs contained an open structure with very few old trees (>250 yr). Significant differences in the ages of trees existed between forested vegetation types and the more open blanket bog vegetation type. Several trees exceeded 1000 yr in age and were situated in lower-productivity bog forest and bog woodland sites. We found no evidence of widespread tree cohort establishment, indicating that small-scale disturbances such as individual tree mortality and gap-forming dynamics are likely the most frequent disturbance in the study area.

AB Little is known about the vegetation dynamics of fens, and especially of hydrologically undisturbed examples. We described the vegetation of an undisturbed mesotrophic rich fen (percolation mire) in 2006-2008 and 2016 and compared our results with vegetation records from the 1980s to identify any longer-term changes. Eight vegetation types were distinguished. On the whole, the vegetation of the mire has remained very stable throughout the last 30 years. However, detailed comparisons of permanent plots recorded twice in the last ten years indicated an expansion of shrubs in patches of Sphagnum - small sedge vegetation. There were also several less prominent changes in the abundance of particular species in other mire vegetation types: (1) an increase of sedges, reeds and Calhergonella cuspidata at the expense of rich-fen moss species in communities of brown moss - small sedge; (2) a change in composition of the moss layer in pine - birch fen woodland; (3) an increase of reedbed species and reduced Alnus gluhnosa abundance in flooded riparian alder woodland; and (4) a decline of wetland herbs and mosses in alder spring fen woodland at the edges of the valley.

AB Vegetation succession in mires is rather well identified using the paleoecological approach. Recently, the ecological succession concept has been extended to ecosystem functions, e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics. Although a strong link between mire vegetation and carbon dynamics is well acknowledged, the successional changes in mire ecosystem functions have remained practically unstudied, especially under the same climate control. To study the patterns and dynamics of CO2 exchange during mire succession, we measured CO2 exchange and vegetation dynamics over 2 growing seasons along a chronosequence on the land uplift coast of the Bay of Bothnia in western Finland. The study showed a decrease in photosynthesis during mire succession that was linked to compositional change in vegetation, i.e., replacement of sedge and herb dominance with the dominance of dwarf shrubs and Sphagna. Similarly, the study revealed decreased variation in gross photosynthesis (P-G) and ecosystem respiration (R-E) over a growing season, which resulted in lower levels of seasonal CO2 dynamics at older stages, The observed successional trend in phenology and CO2 dynamics was largely a consequence of the gradual decrease in the abundance of plant groups with efficient photosynthesis and green area production.

   ANALYSIS
AB In the Vecht river plain, the vegetation diversity has been diminished during recent decades, due to hydrological changes and resulting eutrophication. Different options are discussed for hydrological management aimed at abating the eutrophication and at stimulating the characteristic mesotraphent succession phases of the fen vegetation. The ecological impact of the management plans are estimated with the hydro-ecological model ICHORS; this model takes into account the relations between the non-biotic environment and the presence of hydrophytes and phreatophytes. The impact of the hydrological options is assessed, after rearrangement of the predicted values of the species to values of the required fen vegetation. These results are incorporated in the management options with the water balances of the polders. Information on the costs of the options is used as a basis for a cost-benefit analysis. Technical hydrological solutions such as purification of the supplied water might contribute to the eutrophication abatement, but they are on their own unlikely to restore the ecosystems. Contrastingly, options involving the restoration of the original hydrology would probably lead to the characteristic mesotraphent fen vegetation once more, and the financial implications of this are likely to be the more favourable in the long-term.

AB Heavily degraded waterlogged archaeological wood samples were tested for their ability to provide a substrate for aerobic wood degrading fungi. White- and brown-rot fungi were inoculated on sterilised 1600 year old ash wood previously degraded by erosion bacteria to determine their ability to degrade the wood further. It was found that only white rot was able to utilise the degraded wood tissue. Attack was observed on a macroscopic level as localised holes after 8 months of incubation and confirmed by light microscopy. In contrast to degradation on fresh ash, development of mycelia was significantly repressed. Increase in oxygen levels during draining of waterlogged soils or peat could lead to severe decay of archaeological wooden remains well before any detrimental changes due to desiccation.

AB To elucidate the sensitivity of bog ecosystems to high levels of nitrogen (N) deposition, we investigated the fate of N-15-labeled N deposition in bog vegetation in the Netherlands, both at ambient and increased N deposition. We doubled N deposition by adding 5 g N m(-2) y(-1) as dissolved NH4NO3 during three growing seasons to large peat monoliths (1.1 m diameter) with intact bog vegetation kept in large outdoor containers. A small amount of N-15 tracer was applied at the start of the second growing season, and its distribution among Sphagnum, vascular plant species, and peat was determined at the end of the third growing season. The N-15 tracer was also applied to additional plots at the untreated field site to check for initial distribution. One week after addition, 79% of the total amount of N-15 retrieved was found in the living Sphagnum layer and less than 10% had been captured by vascular plants. Fifteen months later, 63% of the total amount of N-15 retrieved was still present in the living Sphagnum layer at ambient N deposition. Increased N deposition significantly reduced the proportion of N-15 in Sphagnum and increased the amount of N-15 in vascular plants. Deep-rooting vascular plant species were significantly more N-15 enriched, suggesting that at higher atmospheric inputs N penetrates deeper into the peat. Our results provide the first direct experimental evidence for that which has often been suggested: Increased atmospheric N deposition will lead to increased N availability for vascular plants in ombrotrophic mires.

AB In the mire of la Vraconnaz located in the Jura Mountains (Switzerland) at a mean altitude of 1090 m, a bog burst occurred in September 1987 after an extraordinary spell of heavy rainfall. This mire has a surface of about 30 ha of raised bog surrounded by 25 ha of fen. An area of about 15 ha on the western part of the mire was affected by the slide. The affected vegetation included various bog communities as well as communities of acidic and alcaline fen plants (Sphagnion magellanici, Caricion nigrae, Caricion davallianae).
   This study reports on the changes in vegetation that took place during the 11 years after the bog burst. The behaviour of pioneer species and the secondary succession on bare peat were also observed. Statistical analysis of indicator values showed a general eutrophication and a closing of the herb layer in the slide area. The most sensitive vegetation group is that of the acidic fen (Caricion nigrae) that became significantly drier. The total species richness showed an increase.
   All pioneer species (first colonists) that appeared on bare peat after 2 years are perennials, either geophytes or hemicryptophytes and the majority of them are transient species. Species diversity in pioneer vegetation increased during the first 9 years and then become stable. The fuzzy ordination pointed to a succession towards the vegetation groups of acidic and alcaline fen rather than towards bog or meadow vegetation. We suppose that the settlement of plants on bare peat is greatly influenced by the species composition in the adjacent areas and that the mosaic pattern of bare peat and full-cover vegetation favorish the comeback of the vegetation present before the disturbance.

AB Although conservation of percolation mires is very important for the European biodiversity, our understanding of their functioning is still insufficient, as most of the studied sites are to some extent degraded. We present a study on the relationship between vegetation patterns, hydrochemical gradients and water level fluctuations carried out in the Rospuda valley (NE Poland), which was recently discovered for science as a uniquely preserved fully functioning percolation mire. Vegetation composition, mire water chemistry and water level dynamics were studied along five transects perpendicular to the valley. Eight major vegetation types were identified: brown moss-small and slender sedge fens, Sphagnum-small sedge fens, brown moss-tall sedge fens, tall sedge-reed fens, pine-birch fen woodlands and shrublands, spruce fen woodlands, inundated alder woodlands, alder spring fen woodlands. The seasonal dynamics of water table was revealed as the major factor explaining vegetation patterns. The studied chemical parameters were relatively homogeneous in the whole mire-there is a rather uniform type of mineral-rich nutrient-poor subsurface water all across the fen.

AB Production-to-decomposition quotients and asymptotic limits of peat accumulation were determined to estimate peat and carbon accumulation potentials along a bog-fen-marsh wetland gradient in southern boreal Alberta. The wetlands were a bog, a poor fen (PF), a. wooded moderate-rich fen (WRF), a lacustrine sedge fen (LSF), a riverine sedge fen (RSF), a riverine marsh (RM), and a lacustrine marsh (LM). First year mass losses increased along this gradient (bog 14%, fens 25-61%, marshes 57-62%), with second year total mass losses increasing from 18 to 38% from the bog to the moderate-rich fens. Ratios of aboveground net primary production to decomposition and asymptotic limits of peat accumulation showed decreasing trends from the bog to the fens to the marshes as decay rates increased along the same gradient. The Sphagnum-dominated sites (bog, PF) showed greater pea accumulation potentials than the brown moss-dominated sites (WRF, LSF) and those sites with an insignificant-to-no moss stratum (RSF, RM, LM), which is paralleled by their decreasing peat thicknesses. Rates of litter accumulation in the first year averaged 170 g m(-2) yr(-1) in Sphagnum-dominated sites, 130 g m(-2) yr(-1) in brown moss-dominated sites, and 103 g m(-2) yr(-1) in sites with an insignificant-to-no moss stratum. All three wetland types showed similar carbon accumulation potentials (83, 67, and 50 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) after the first year of decomposition. Peat depth, asymptotic limits of peat accumulation, and production-to-decomposition ratios correlated negatively with water levels, pH, and Ca2+, and they correlated positively with moss and woody plant production (shrubs, trees). Peatlands with strong moss and shrub/tree strata (bog, PF, WRF) accumulate more peat than those wetlands dominated by graminoids (LSF, RSF RM, LM). In the bog, high peat accumulation potentials may be related to low rates of decomposition. The peat accumulation potentials of some fens (PF, WRF) are similar to the bog and may be maintained by higher decomposition rates, which are offset by higher litter inputs. In the graminoid-dominated fens and marshes, peat accumulation potentials are lowest and may be related to higher litter quality, resulting in higher decomposition rates.

AB Species groups created using DCA ordination for Western Carpathian fen vegetation (Scheuchzerio-Caricetea fuscae) are presented and compared with species groups used in phytosociological classification. The analysis of 1353 releves from the western parts of Carpathians (Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Ukraine) confirms that the poor-rich gradient from alkaline to acidic and dystrophic conditions controls the main variability in the Western Carpathian fens. The classification of Carpathian fens reflects this feature. The second most important cause of variation in species data can be related to organic matter (or lacustrine chalk) content in the soil. Several groups are related to meadow or bog vegetation. The groups of diagnostic species published for Slovakia were verified using phi-coefficient calculation. Among them, the order and alliance groups were best confirmed. The Caricetalia davallianae, Caricetalia fuscae and Molinietalia groups are the most comprehensive. Three association groups were verified. All results confirm the crucial importance of bryophytes as indicators of habitat conditions, which makes this taxonomic group important for phytosociological classification.

AB The natural recovery of vegetation on abandoned peat extraction areas lasts for decades and the result of restoration succession can be unpredictable. The aim of the study was to specify environmental factors that affect the formation of the pioneer stages of mire communities and, therefore, be helpful in the prediction of the resulting ecosystem properties. We used the national inventory data from 64 milled peatlands in Estonia, distributed over the region of 300x200km. This is the first national-scale statistical evaluation of abandoned extracted peatlands. During surveys, vascular plants, bryophytes, and residual peat properties were recorded on three microtopographic forms: flats, ditch margins, and ditches. The microtopography was the main factor distinguishing the composition of plant communities on flats and ditches, while ditch margins resembled flats. The extracted indicator species suggested two successional pathways, toward fen or raised bog community. A single indicator traitthe depth of residual peat, which combines the information about peat properties (e.g. pH, ash content, and trophicity status), predicted the plant community succession in microtopographic habitats. We suggest that peatland management plans about the cost-efficient restoration of abandoned peat mining areas should consider properties of residual peat layer as the baseline indicator: milled peatfields with thin (<2.3m) and well-decomposed residual peat should be restored toward fen vegetation types, whereas sites with thick (>2.3m) and less decomposed residual peat layer should be restored toward transitional mires or raised bogs. Specific methodological suggestions are provided.

AB We have developed an approach to restore bogs after peat extraction, but, when sedge-peat layers are exposed, the minerotrophic remnant peat conditions require restoration towards a fen ecosystem. Three restoration techniques, all including rewetting actions, were tested to assist fen vegetation recovery. None of the restoration techniques were effective at establishing fen bryophytes. However, for vascular plants, two techniques gave promising results in terms of species composition, although the vascular plant cover remained lower than in the reference fens. Depending on the site conditions, we suggest applying two restoration techniques to restore peatlands in areas of exposed sedge peat. In areas where sparse cover of fen species may have spontaneously established, rewetting should be carried out to raise water levels and create favourable conditions for their expansion. In areas covered with undesirable species or with inadequate topography for rewetting, surface peat should be remodeled and vegetation introduced. Since mechanized diaspore transfer did not result in a satisfactory cover of fen plants, other means of introduction could be considered, alone or in combination. A complementary fertilization experiment showed that fertilization with phosphorus could be an effective solution to enhance the establishment of mechanically introduced plant diaspores.

AB The aim of the research was to carry out a multidisciplinary study of a mire possessing a ribbed pattern typical for aapa mires and yet situated in the Vologda Region of Russia, which is farther south than the supposed southern limit of aapa mire distribution. The study shows that the mire lies in its own basin while being part of a complex mire system. Its microtopography is represented by three well-defined elements, namely strings, lawns and flarks, which condition the mosaic structure of the vegetative cover. In terms of flora and vegetation composition, this mire is very similar to Fennoscandian rich aapa mires although it lacks a number of typical western species. Dense, well-developed tree stands on strings are prominent features of this mire. The peat deposit is of fen (predominantly swamp) type. The stratigraphy of the peat deposit demonstrates its secondary nature and the young age of the strings. Dendrochronology showed that the phase of active development of the tree stand began about 200 years ago. Thus, the mire fully corresponds to the concept of an aapa mire, on the basis of (1) characteristic topography; (2) heterotrophic vegetation typical of aapa mires; and (3) secondary nature of the strings and their young age. The studied mire provides habitat for several rare species of vascular plants and mosses, and thus requires protection.

AB Dynamics of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were determined for three perched bogs, formed by lake filling, and three raised bogs, formed by landscape swamping.  N and K concentrations were higher in the undergrowth of perched bogs, and Ca and Mg concentrations were higher in subsurface anaerobic peat of raised bogs.  Elemental pools in vegetation were in the order N > Ca > K > Mg > P; in surface peat, N > Ca > Mg > P = K.  Differences in elemental mass between the bog types were closely related to biomass differences.  The atmosphere potentially supplied from 3% of annual plant uptake of K to 20% of Mg; this fraction was inversely related to uptake as a proportion of the surface peat.  Vegetation on raised bogs had a greater proportion of uptake from the atmosphere (15 vs. 12%), a faster rate of elemental turnover (3.8 vs. 4.8 years), and lower net primary productivity (NPP) than on perched bogs, all indicative of a lower nutrient status.  The annual mineralization rate of the surface peat for both bog types was estimated at 1.5% year-1; NPP predicted from N mineralized at this rate agrees well with observations.  The better nutritional status of perched bogs may be related to landscape position, with potential inputs via runoff from adjacent uplands.  The nutrient capital in both bog vegetation and substrate was similar to that in upland northern conifer forests.

AB . We tested whether rewetting improved environmental conditions during peatland restoration and promoted colonization and development of mire vegetation. Vegetation change was monitored in a cut-away peatland one year before, and four years after, rewetting. Colonizers before rewetting were perennials, mostly typical of hummocks or bare peat surfaces. The main variation in vegetation was related to variation in the amounts of major nutrients and water table level. The wettest site with the highest nutrient level had the highest total vegetation cover and diversity, as well as some species typical of wet minerotrophic mires. Raising the water table level above, or close to, the soil surface promoted development of wet minerotrophic vegetation. Diversity initially decreased because of the disappearance of hummock vegetation but started to recover in the third year. Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex rostrata were both favoured, and bryophytes typical of wet habitats colonized the site. Moderate rewetting promoted the development of Eriophorum vaginatum seedlings and an increase in the cover of tussocks. Bryophytes typical of disturbed peat surfaces spread. In the control site development continued slowly towards closed hummock vegetation. The study showed that raising the water level to, or above, soil surface promotes conditions wet enough for a rapid succession towards closed mire vegetation.

AB Soaks (areas of mesotrophic/minerotrophic vegetation within acid bog) add to the overall heterogeneity and biodiversity of raised bog landscapes due to the presence of flora and fauna communities not typically associated with acid bog systems. A field experiment was set up to investigate the potential to restore the minerotrophic and aquatic communities that previously occurred within a soak of an oceanic raised bog in Ireland, which has recently undergone acidification with the expansion of acid bog type vegetation. Three different treatments, control (intact sphagnaceous raft), permeable (sphagnaceous raft removed), and enclosed (sphagnaceous raft removed and plots isolated from surrounding surface water influence) were applied to a total of six plots (each measuring 4 x 4 m), each treatment consisting of two replicates. Within 3 years a sphagnaceous raft with similar vegetation to the surroundings had developed in both permeable plots, while aquatic communities similar to those that occurred at the site in the past had established within the enclosed pots. Our results show that with manipulation of local hydrology it is possible to recreate conditions suitable for aquatic plant communities that once characterized the site. The results also give an insight into the likely processes responsible for the initial terrestrialization of the entire soak over the past century. Application of the results in relation to the site and the widespread practice of restoring bog vegetation on degraded peatlands are discussed.

AB Changes in hydrology and temperature can induce rapid changes in boreal wetland ecosystems. Factors such as hydrosere, permafrost, climate and human interference may disturb the prevailing mire vegetation, whereby a new dominant assemblage can develop. At the transition from one vegetation type to another, the old vegetation may be suppressed, die out or start to decay, and some time may pass until a new mire vegetation is fully established. Here, we demonstrate that diatoms may thrive during such transitions, creating isolated and shallow peat layers with significantly elevated biogenic silica content. Biogenic silica and other nutrients that would otherwise be lost during mineralization in runoff are in this way retained in the ecosystem. Our results imply that silica storage originating from diatoms can be expected to increase in today's rapidly changing boreal wetlands. The impacts on transport of Si through boreal watersheds are currently unknown. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Questions: On-going rapid loss of fen biodiversity in Central Europe is well known, but rigorous testing of this is complicated. We compared historical and present-day vegetation plot records from a cultural landscape rich in fishponds, where recent eutrophication and water table manipulations threaten the unique fen diversity. We assess species composition change over the last 50 yr.
   Location: Trebon Basin, Czech Republic.
   Methods: First, we revisited historical vegetation plots to collect present-day data and then identified the most similar present-day record ( the present-day counterpart) because no permanent plots were available. Second, we inferred water level, pH and conductivity (a proxy of mineral richness) using a training set of present-day field measurements, and calculated Ellenberg indicator values. Then we applied modified TWINSPAN classification, CCA, PERMANOVA, PERMDISP and RMANOVA in order to test changes in the species composition, beta-diversity and environmental conditions between the historical records and their present-day counterparts.
   Results: Fen vegetation has persisted on half of the sites. Out of four vegetation types, poor fens and especially flooded fens were over-represented in the present-day subset, while rich fens and quaking fens were under-represented. Overall species composition differed between historical plots and their presentday counterparts, even within individual vegetation types. Historical rich fens showed significantly higher b-diversity than their present-day counterparts, which predominantly represent flooded fens. Inferred water level and its fluctuation, Ellenberg moisture and nutrient values have increased, while inferred pH, conductivity and Ellenberg light value have decreased.
   Conclusions: The historically wide array of fen vegetation has turned into a homogeneous and floristically depauperate set of acidic yet productive flooded fens with a high water level. Rich and quaking fens that were both low in nutrient availability and had a stable water level near the moss layer experienced a large and substantial reduction and have become rare in the landscape. Eutrophication combined with a lack of management has resulted in fen species persisting only in flooded fens. However, fluctuating water levels and high nutrient availability in flooded fens favour productive Sphagnum fens over the other vegetation types, and, importantly, do not support some endangered fen species.

AB Habitat loss and degradation are the main threats to biodiversity worldwide. For example, nearly 80% of peatlands in southern Finland have been drained. There is thus a need to safeguard the remaining pristine mires and to restore degraded ones. Ants play a pivotal role in many ecosystems and like many keystone plant species, shape ecosystem conditions for other biota. The effects of mire restoration and subsequent vegetation succession on ants, however, are poorly understood. We inventoried tree stands, vegetation, water-table level, and ants (with pitfall traps) in nine mires in southern Finland to explore differences in habitats, vegetation and ant assemblages among pristine, drained (30-40 years ago) and recently restored (1-3 years ago) pine mires. We expected that restoring the water-table level by ditch filling and reconstructing sparse tree stands by cuttings will recover mire vegetation and ants. We found predictable responses in habitat structure, floristic composition and ant assemblage structure both to drainage and restoration. However, for mire-specialist ants the results were variable and longer-term monitoring is needed to confirm the success of restoration since these social insects establish perennial colonies with long colony cycles. We conclude that restoring the water-table level and tree stand structure seem to recover the characteristic vegetation and ant assemblages in the short term. This recovery was likely enhanced because drained mires still had both acrotelm and catotelm, and connectedness was still reasonable for mire organisms to recolonize the restored mires either from local refugia or from populations of nearby mires.

AB 1. The aim of the study was to investigate effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on the balance between biomass production and decay in an ombrotrophic bog which is dominated by one species of Sphagnum (S. fuscum). This paper concerns production.
   2. Enhanced W-B radiation (simulating 15% ozone depletion under clear sky conditions) was applied by means of fluorescent tubes during two growing seasons.
   3. In S. fuscum, shoot density, mass relations and length increment over time were measured and productivity was estimated, Pigment concentration, rates of dark respiration and maximum net photosynthesis were recorded.
   4. Sphagnum fuscum productivity was not changed by enhanced UV-B radiation while properties determining production were highly influenced although in opposite directions.
   5. Height increment was decreased by 20% in the first growing season and by 31% in the second growing season under enhanced UV-B radiation. After two growing seasons spatial shoot density was decreased by 8% by enhanced W-B radiation. The shoots became stunted as capitulum dry mass and stem dry mass per unit length were increased by 21 and 17%, respectively, under enhanced W-B radiation.
   6. Dark; respiration was significantly decreased by 31% after growth under enhanced W-B radiation.
   7. The UV-B induced change in shoot biometry together with the reduced spatial shoot density involve potential long-term effects on peat structure with possible feedback on productivity, decomposition and the strength of the system as a carbon sink.

AB Question: How does nutrient limitation vary along major environmental gradients in fens and wet meadows?
   Location: West Carpathians ( Czech Republic, Slovakia).
   Methods: We recorded total plant species composition in 83 plots of 9 m(2). Living above-ground biomass of total vegetation was sampled. Concentrations of Ca, Fe, N, P, K were determined. Obtained data were analysed by various univariate and multivariate statistical techniques.
   Results: Major environmental gradients correspond to the poor-rich vegetation gradient, from poor Sphagnum-fens to calcareous fens, and the fen-meadow gradient from sedgemoss fens to forb-rich wet meadows. Ca-concentration in above-ground biomass was strongly positively correlated with the poor-rich gradient, while Fe- and N-concentrations had an opposite trend. Poor-fen vegetation contained little calcium and much iron. The lowest P-concentrations were found in calcareous tufa-forming fens. Variation in N: K ratio indicated a slight decrease of K-availability towards poor fens. Along the fen-meadow gradient, vegetation uptake of P, K and Ca increases and the uptake of Fe decreases.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that variation in the type of nutrient limitation is not a dominant cause of the poor-rich gradient in fens due to the important role of calcium and iron. Nevertheless, species distribution along the poor-rich gradient is influenced by phosphorus shortage in tufa-forming fens and relatively high N-uptake and low K-availability in poor fens. Additional P- and K-supply to Ca-rich fens can alter species composition towards forb-rich meadows.

AB Hilly regions along the Western Carpathian-Pannonian border are phytogeographically important, but their vegetation history remains largely unknown. We analysed two peat cores of Late Glacial origin from a bog woodland in the Male Karpaty Mts (SW Slovakia) using plant macrofossil, pollen, peat chemistry and charcoal analyses to trace local successional patterns, regional vegetation development and occurrence of rare species. The small distance between the two profiles situated within homogeneous vegetation enabled us to explore small-scale differences in local vegetation history. The sediment started to accumulate at the end of the Allerod (ca. 12950 cal. yr BP), when a shallow oligotrophic/mesotrophic lake with macrophytes developed. Open pine-birch forests dominated in the landscape. During the early Holocene, the lake was infilled, mire vegetation appeared and broad-leaved forests spread in the surroundings. Two fire events indicated by increases in number of macroscopic charcoal particles were recorded. The first one, which occurred at the end of the Late Glacial, was found only in one of the profiles, while the second one affected entire mire and probably caused a hiatus spanning the middle and late Holocene. Fagus started to spread no later than 5800 cal. yr BP. Open mire vegetation reappeared after the fire (ca. 400 cal. yr BP). During the 19th century, the mire was overgrown by a birch bog woodland. The two profiles showed basically the same successional patterns, but some local events and occurrences of rare species (Potamogeton alpinus, Potamogeton praelongus, Scorpidium scorpioides and Pleurospermum austriacum) were traced only in one of them.

AB (1) I explore the hypothesis that the water regime is one of the major determinants of the difference between bog and fen in Sphagnum mires because of its effects on the decay loss and the mass accretion rate. This article deals with the recent mass balance and water regime and the variation in mass accretion rate during the last millennium, studied at two mires in southern Sweden.
   (2) At one bog site and one fen site in the Akhult mire the recent litter input to the acrotelm and mass accretion in the catotelm were 210 and 38 g m(-2) a(-1) at the bog site and 300 and 21 g m(-2) a(-1) at the fen site, respectively. The difference in productivity reflected the availability of plant nutrients and the pH. The smaller loss of mass at the bog site was a result of smaller water table amplitude and a higher median time water level (MTWL) than at the fen site. Through its effects on hummock formation, the water regime is also a major determinant of the surface structure.
   (3) Around 1000 cal. BP the precipitation and the supply of mineral soil water to the two sites increased and the bog vegetation of that time was replaced by fen vegetation. Mass accretion first increased to 180 g m(-2) a(-1) but with the upward growth of the mire surface the rate decreased. The recent conditions at the fen site became established similar to 800 cal. BP, probably as a result of increased water table amplitudes. At the bog site the water regime changed from geogenous to ombrogenous similar to 600 cal. BP, contemporary with a decrease in precipitation. This change resulted in a rapid increase in mass accretion by 150 % followed by a slow decrease until recent times with low values. The same development was found to have occurred twice at the Store Mosse mire. Such an initial increase in the peat accretion rate must be important for the formation of permanently ombrotrophic conditions in raised bogs.

AB We studied the vegetation of 166 fens in Yellowstone National Park, USA, to determine the relationship between species distribution in mountain peatlands and regional-, landscape-, and local-scale environmental variables. Plant communities were identified through hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis, patterns in species distribution were explored using nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and the relative importance of variables was assessed though partial canonical correspondence analysis. Five major bedrock types influenced groundwater feeding fens: three volcanic types, a glacial till complex, and rock altered by acidic geothermal activity. Ionic concentrations generally increased with pH, but acidic geothermal fens had very low pH and high electrical conductivity. Bryophyte distribution was controlled by groundwater chemistry, while vascular plants responded to a broader range of variables. When partitioned by spatial scale, landscape variables accounted for >60% of the variation explained. When partitioned categorically, geochemical and topographic variables were more important than geographic factors. For fens in mountainous regions, the primary gradient is site-level water chemistry, which is strongly linked to regional bedrock geology. Site- and stand-level topography represent a secondary gradient. Most mountain fens fit within the established poor-rich gradient; however, geochemical acid production creates a distinct category outside the conventional paradigm.

AB Data on past peatland growth patterns, vegetation development, and carbon (C) dynamics during the various Holocene climate phases may help us to understand possible future climate-peatland feedback mechanisms. In this study, we analyzed and radiocarbon dated several peat cores from Kalevansuo, a drained bog in southern Finland. We investigated peatland succession and C dynamics throughout the Holocene. These data were used to reconstruct the long-term atmospheric radiative forcing, i.e., climate impact of the peatland since initiation. Kalevansuo peat records revealed a general development from fen to bog, typical for the southern boreal zone, but the timing of ombrotrophication varied in different parts of the peatland. Peat accumulation patterns and lateral expansion through paludification were influenced by fires and climate conditions. Long-term C accumulation rates were overall lower than the average values found from literature. We suggest the low accumulation rates are due to repeated burning of the peat surface. Drainage for forestry resulted in a nearly complete replacement of typical bog mosses by forest species within 40 years after drainage. The radiative forcing reconstruction suggested positive values ( warming) for the first similar to 7000 years following initiation. The change from positive to negative forcing was triggered by an expansion of bog vegetation cover and later by drainage. The strong relationship between peatland area and peat type with radiative forcing suggests a possible feedback for future changing climate, as high-latitude peatlands may experience prominent regime shifts, such as fen to bog transitions.

AB Since the Last Glacial Maximum, boreal wetlands have accumulated substantial amounts of peat, estimated at 180-621 Pg of carbon. Wetlands have significantly affected the atmospheric greenhouse gas composition in the past and will play a significant role in future changes of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. In order to investigate those changes with an Earth system model, bio-geochemical processes in boreal wetlands need to be accounted for. Thus, a model of peat accumulation and decay was developed and included in the land surface model JSBACH of the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). Here we present the evaluation of model results from 6000 yr BP to the pre-industrial period. Over this period of time, 240 Pg of peat carbon accumulated in the model in the areas north of 40 degrees N. Simulated peat accumulation rates agree well with those reported for boreal wetlands. The model simulates CH4 emissions of 49.3 Tg CH4 yr(-1) for 6000 yr BP and 51.5 Tg CH4 yr(-1) for pre-industrial times. This is within the range of estimates in the literature, which range from 32 to 112 Tg CH4 yr(-1) for boreal wetlands. The modelled methane emission for the West Siberian Lowlands and Hudson Bay Lowlands agree well with observations. The rising trend of methane emissions over the last 6000 yr is in agreement with measurements of Antarctic and Greenland ice cores.

DT Article
AB We recorded Oeneis jutta (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) at 60 of 78 peatland sites in central and northern Wisconsin on butterfly transect surveys on 113 dates during 2002-11. Additional observations come from informal observations on 19 dates in 12 years during 1987-2001. Most sites where we did not find O. jutta had little survey effort. The areas with the lowest O. jutta abundance (coastal and inland Bayfield County) had the shortest flight periods recorded in this study. O. jutta abundance negatively and significantly correlated with increasing wind speed and later times of day. O. jutta abundance significantly varied by bog vegetation type and in similar bog vegetation between subregions. Within each bog type, O. jutta significantly increased in abundance with greater tree cover. O. jutta occurred in the full range of bog sizes surveyed (1.84-114.80 ha), including the most isolated small peatlands. O. jutta showed virtually no tendency to venture out of bogs. It was rarely found in roadsides (only when they bisected an occupied peatland) and not farther away from a peatland. O. jutta was significantly more abundant in even than odd years in northeast Wisconsin but not in the other subregions. Wisconsin peatlands present a natural experiment showing that localized butterfly populations such as O. jutta can persist for long periods in isolated sites as long as they remain relatively stable vegetatively.

AB Question: Is ombrotrophic bog vegetation in an oceanic region of southwestern Sweden changing in the same direction over a five year period (1999 - 2004) as northwest European bogs in the last 50 years, i.e. towards drier and more eutrophic vegetation?
   Location: The province of Halland, southwestern Sweden.
   Methods: Changes in species composition were monitored in 750 permanently marked plots in 25 ombrotrophic bogs from 1999 to 2004. Changes in species occurrences and richness were analysed and a multivariate statistical method (DCA) was used to analyse vegetation changes.
   Results: The species composition changed towards wetter rather than drier conditions, which is unlike the general pattern of vegetation change on bogs in northwestern Europe. Species typical of wetter site conditions including most Sphagnum species increased in abundance on the bogs until 2004. The total number of species per plot increased, mostly due to the increased species richness of Sphagnum species. Nitrogen-demanding (eutrophic) species increased in occurrence.
   Conclusions: Ombrotrophic bog vegetation in an oceanic region in Sweden became wetter and was resilient to short-term climatic shifts, after three years of below normal precipitation followed by several years with normal precipitation levels. Shifts towards more nitrogen demanding species were rapid in this region where the deposition levels have been high for several decades.

AB Analyses of peat humification, testate amoebae, carbon and nitrogen content have been carried Out Oil a peat sequence from Altabergsmossen. At Gullbergbymossen testate amoebae and peat humification were analysed. Both bogs are located in eastern central Sweden. The longest sequence, Altabergsmossen, covers the last 150 yr and the data from Gullbergbymossen covers the last 60 yr, both with a time resolution of ca. 2-4 yr cm(-1). The different proxies were compared to each other and were also compared to instrumental meteorological data. Correlation between peat humification and C/N ratios is high whereas the correlation is low between these physical/chemical parameters and reconstructed water tables inferred from the testate amoebae assemblages. High peat humification values and C/N ratios greater than 50 indicate aerobic decay and are thought to reflect the thickness of the acrotelm. High humification values and low C/N ratios are recorded in peat deposited between 1965 and 1980, whereas the dry period starts in the early 1970s according to instrumental meteorological data and inferred water-table depth. The difference in the timing of the onset of a dry-shift between the physical/chennical proxies and meteorological data and testate amoebae derived water table changes is interpreted as renewed decay of already deposited peat. The term secondary decomposition is used for this process. The secondary decomposition process has implications for interpreting physical/chemical and biological parameters in peat as they may be Out of phase during the beginning of a dry-shift.

AB Boreal mires encompass high diversity in species and habitats, many of which are endangered. In Finland, extensive use of peatlands has resulted in habitat fragmentation. A need for accurate and cost-efficient vegetation mapping and monitoring of habitat changes exists in mire conservation, restoration and peatland forestry. LiDAR is an emerging and excellent tool for probing the geometry of vegetation and terrain. Modern systems measure the backscattered signal accurately and also provide radiometric information. Experiments were carried out in a complex minerotrophic-ombrotrophic eccentric raised bog in southern Finland (61 degrees 47'N, 24.18'E). First, we tested discrete-return LiDAR for the modeling of mire surface patterns and the detection of hummocks and hollows, as well as the effect of mire plants on the Z accuracy of the surface echoes. Secondly, the response of different mire vegetation samples in LiDAR intensity was examined. Thirdly, we tested area-based geometric and radiometric features in supervised classification of mire habitats to discover the meaningful variables. The vertical accuracy of LiDAR in mire surface modeling was high: 0.05-0.10 m. A binary hummock-hollow model that was estimated from a LiDAR-based elevation model matched flawlessly in aerial images and had moderate explanatory power in habitat classification trials. The intensity of LiDAR in open-mire vegetation was mainly influenced by the surface moisture, and separation of vegetation classes spanning from ombrotrophic to mesotrophic vegetation proved to be difficult. Area-based features that characterize the height distribution of LiDAR points in the canopy were the strongest explanatory variables in the classification of 21 diverse mire site types. Actual qualifying differences in the ground flora were unattainable in the LiDAR data, which resulted in inferior accuracy in the characterization of ecohydrological conditions and nutrient level of open mires and sparsely forested wet sites. Mire habitat classification accuracy with LiDAR surpassed earlier results with optical data. The results suggested that LiDAR constitutes an efficient aid for monitoring applications. We propose the co-use of images and LiDAR for enhanced mapping of open mires and tree species. In situ calibration and validation procedures are required until invariant geometric and radiometric features are discovered. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A description of the bog-pine (Pinus uncinata var. rotundata) dominated vegetation of uncut oligotrophic mires affected by drainage is given. Surveys were carried out at 17 sites along the Jura Mountains (Switzerland and France) in 1993, 1994, and 1995. Raised bogs of the Jura are generally of small size, and most vegetation changes in them have occurred as a result of the indirect impact of peat cutting. This activity led to the peat drying out and to colonization by trees, in particular by bog-pines.
   Integrated synusial phytosociology was used to describe the vegetation where bog-pine, spruce, and birch occur. Two spatio-temporal levels of organization were considered: the synusia and the phytocoenosis. At the phytocoenosis level, four vegetation types representing bog-pine stands of uncut and deep oligotrophic peats are described with their constitutive synusial composition. They represent: (1) phytocoenoses developing in the open, wet central parts of the bogs, where trees are scattered and of small size, (2) phytocoenoses with layered tree stands of medium size and with a higher density, and (3) phytocoenoses with tall trees, developing generally near the edge of the bogs or close to peat cuttings. A generalized qualitative dynamic model of the vegetation in relation to the development of bog-pine trees was developed. It shows the spatial and temporal organization of the constituent synusiae, as well as other underlying hypothetical functional relations.
   The different bog-pine-dominated vegetation types described in this study appear to have coexisted since the origin of the Jura bogs as a result of local polyclimaxes induced by differential waterlogged situations. They probably all belong to the same (primary) successional series, but have been affected by both autogenic and allogenic processes. During the development of the bogs the balance between the different communities changed. In particular, the vegetation types with dense and tall pine trees have undergone a drastic expansion since the Jura bogs were first affected by drainage.

AB Multivariate land classification and land cover mapping by aerial photographic interpretation were used to model spatial variation of land cover in the Wicklow Mountains, Ireland and to structure a stratified random sampling programme of upland blanket bog vegetation. The total area of blanket bog with gully-erosion features was estimated as 33% of the area studied. Vegetation with hand peat-cutting patterns was estimated at 5%, and there was 35% undissected (intact) vegetation. There were differences between land classes in the estimated area of land cover with gully-erosion features or hand peat-cutting patterns.
   Sample vegetation quadrats, stratified by land class and aerial photographic land cover type, were grouped by their plant species composition. The groups represented ombrotrophic mire, soligenous mire and shrub heath vegetation. There was significant association between vegetation group and land class, related to variation in regional landscape type, but no significant association between vegetation group and the aerial photographic land cover types, undissected (intact) and dissected (gullied and cut-over) pears. It is proposed that the similarity of vegetation between undissected and dissected blanket bog is related to vegetation regeneration. The need to consider differences in vegetation distribution, composition and dynamics in ecological management strategies is emphasised. The study demonstrated the value of stratified random field sampling for cost-efficient regional ecological assessment in upland blanket bog landscapes typified by the Wicklow mountains, Ireland.

AB Palaeoecological analyses of raised peat bog deposits in northwest Europe show the naturalness, antiquity and robust response of these ecosystems to environmental changes from c. 7800 years ago to the present. A review of the techniques used to identify these long-term features is presented and the role of climate change, autogenic change processes and human disturbance is discussed. Millennial records of vegetation changes recorded in peat deposits demonstrate the response (often rapid) of raised peat bog vegetation to climatic changes during the mid-Holocene, Bronze Age/Iron Age transition and the Little Ice Age. Greenhouse warming scenarios exceed the reconstructed Holocene record of climatic changes (c. the last 11, 500 years), and bog-water tables may fall considerably. A combination of centennial palaeoecological analyses of bogs affected by human disturbance and experimental manipulations have been used as analogues for the potential response of raised peat bog vegetation to these changes. These show that possible greenhouse gas climate forcing scenarios may exceed the ability of Sphagnum- dominated raised peat bogs to respond to projected increases in summer temperature and decreases in summer precipitation. In combination with increasing N deposition, a loss of their Sphagnum-rich vegetation and increases in the abundance of vascular plants could occur on decadal timescales.

AB The Holocene developmental history of a small kettle-hole peatland in northern Poland was studied using radiocarbon dating and analyses of pollen, plant macrofossils and testate amoebae with the aim of sorting Out the influences of climate change, autogenic succession and human impact. The mire followed the classical Succession from lake to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland, but peat accumulation only started about 3000 cal. BP. A rapid shift to wetter conditions, lower pH and higher peat accumulation rate took place about 110-150 years before present, when the vegetation shifted to a Sphagnum-dominated poor fen with sonic bog plants. While the first shift to a peat-accumulating system was most likely driven by climate, the second one was probably caused by forest clearance around the mire. This shift towards a Sphagnum-dominated vegetation mirrors both in pattern and timing the changes observed in similar situations in North America and New Zealand. While human activities have overall caused the loss of vast expanses of peatlands worldwide in recent Centuries. locally they may have also allowed the development Of communities that are now ironically considered to have a high conservation value. However, in the case of the site studied the likely anthropogenic shift to bog vegetation was at the expense of a species-rich poor fen, which today has even higher conservation value than ombrotrophic bogs. Thus this study also illustrates the value of palaeoecology for peatland management and biodiversity conservation.

AB In order to focus efforts towards specific vegetation groups in fen restoration, knowledge of the peat-accumulating function of dominant fen species is critical. The decomposition rates of 3 species typical to undisturbed fens and 3 species that spontaneously colonize harvested fens were assessed. These species were incubated in both a restoration site (harvested fen) and an undisturbed fen to compare decomposition according to different environmental conditions. The average exponential decay coefficient (k) for all material types was slightly higher (circa 0.04.y(-1) higher) in the harvested fen than those observed in the undisturbed fen. However, the litter type (leaves, roots/rhizomes, or bryophyte fragments) had the largest impact on the decomposition rates. The 2 tested bryophytes had lower k-values (between 0.14 and 0.11 for Polytrichum strictum and 0.06 for Sphagnum centrale) than the vascular plant litter (between 0.25 and 0.50). The annual primary production of the tested species was also measured to estimate the peat-accumulating capacity of each species. Scirpus cyperinus had an annual primary production that was 3 times higher (1500 g.m(-2).y(-1)) than the other species (between 300 and 550 g.m(-2).y(-1)). Estimates show that the harvested fen has a high peat-accumulating potential due to the high biomass production observed at this site.

AB Drained thermokarst lake basins cover large areas of northern high latitude lowlands. However, the importance of peat accumulated in these drained basins to carbon (C) cycling is poorly understood. Results are presented here from a permafrost sediment core aimed at investigating site history, lake drainage, apparent carbon accumulation, and paleohydrology in a thermokarst basin on the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta in southwestern Alaska. The results show that a thermokarst lake existed for about 2300 years before it drained and a peatland established in the early 1600s. Average apparent C accumulation rate (CAR) was 12 gC/m(2)/yr over the 2300 years before lake drainage, but increased to 120 gC/m(2)/yr following peatland initiation. After transitioning to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland at similar to 1700 AD, CAR reduced gradually before more than doubling from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. This abrupt increase in CAR was possibly in response to a Pacific climate regime shift in the late 1970s, a transition characterized by a nearly 1.5 degrees C increase in regional average annual temperature. Even after considering the differential decay of recent peat, there was an increase in C accumulation after 1977. Reconstructed water-table depths from subfossil testate amoebae show little change throughout the past three centuries, but there was a pronounced shift in testate amoeba composition after the 1977 temperature change (e.g., absence of Phryganella acropodia type and increase in Hyalosphenia elegans). If the results from peatlands in other drained thermokarst lake basins are consistent with the results from this study, then the C accumulated in these vegetated drained basins under current warming might help offset some of the C released from thawing permafrost and thermokarst features in northern regions.

AB We fill a gap in understanding wetland vegetation diversity and relationship with environmental determinants in Bulgarian high mountains. A total of 615 phytosociological samples were taken from springs, mires, wet meadows and tall-forb habitats throughout Bulgaria, of which 234 releves are from mire and spring vegetation above timberline. The vegetation was classified by TWINSPAN and the resulting vegetation types were reproduced by the formal definitions using the combination of Cocktail species groups based on phi-coefficient of joint co-occurrence of the species. Nine vegetation types of springs and fens have been clearly delimited above the timberline. All vegetation types include Balkan endemic species, the representation of which varies. Fens generally harbour more Balkan endemics than do springs, with the exception of species-poor high-altitude Drepanocladetum exannulati. The gradient structure of the vegetation was revealed by DCA and by CCA with forward selection of environmental factors. The major determinants of vegetation variation strongly differ above and below the timberline and likewise between springs and fens. The base-richness gradient controls the floristic variation of Bulgarian submontane fens, whereas the complete data set including both submontane and subalpine fens is governed by the altitude gradient from lowland and basin fens to subalpine fens rich in Balkan endemics. When focusing on sites above the timberline only, the first DCA axis separates fens from springs without organic matter. The major species turnover in springs follows the variation in water pH and mineral content in water, whereas fen vegetation variation is primarily controlled by succession gradient of peat accumulation. Altitude remains an important factor in all cases. Weak correlation between water pH and conductivity was found. This correlation was even statistically insignificant in fens above the timberline. Water pH is not influenced by mineral richness in Bulgarian high mountains, since it is buffered by decomposition of organic matter in fens. In springs, pH reaches maximum values due to strong aeration caused by water flow. The plant species richness decreases significantly with increasing altitude. The increase of species richness towards circumneutral pH, often found in mires, was not confirmed in Bulgarian high mountains. The correlation between species richness and pH was significant only when arctic-alpine species and allied European high-mountain species were considered separately. The richness of boreal species was independent on pH. Some of them had their optima shifted to more acidic fens as compared to regions below the timberline. Our results suggest that subalpine spring and fen vegetation should be analysed separately with respect to vegetation-environment correlations. Separate analysis of fens below and above timberline is quite appropriate.

AB The Evolutionary species pool hypothesis (ESPH) predicts that historically more common habitats will be richer in species because they have had greater opportunity for the evolution of suitably adapted species. We explored the relationship between mire species richness and pH, an important environmental variable in mires, in two regions that differ in habitat pH distribution: the West Carpathians and Bulgaria. Mire habitats in both the West Carpathians and Bulgaria demonstrate support for the ESPH prediction that habitats with more common pH values host more species. We also explored the influence of habitat history by examining the distribution of generalists and specialists along gradients of habitat pH, using extensive community-level vegetation data from European mires in these two regions. We found a striking pattern with the distribution of pH-specialists having three distinct peaks in both regions, whereas the total species pool peaked in near neutral pH habitats in both regions. Because the peaks in specialist richness do not correspond to regional pH distribution patterns, we hypothesize that historical explanations may be important, and that habitats currently rich in pH-specialists may have historically acted as pleniglacial refugia for many mire species. Our findings support the general predictions of the ESPH, but further suggest that historical processes such as patterns of glacial refugia, may significantly influence contemporary species distributions and the diversity of plant species in mire habitats.

AB Vegetation-environment relationships were investigated in fens of the Trebon basin (Czech Republic), which are enriched by nutrients and calcium from intensively managed and limed fishponds to test the hypothesis of altered gradient structure after long-term nutrient enrichment in fens. Water-table depth, pH, conductivity, N-NH4+, N-NO3-, 4 total P, SO42-, K, Ca, Mg and Fe were measured four times in 30 vegetation plots of 16 m(2) during the 2004 vegetation season. Both constrained and unconstrained ordination (DCA, CCA) were used to relate environmental factors to the species composition of the vegetation. The relationships among particular factors were revealed using PCA. Four fen vegetation types obtained by TWINSPAN classification were compared with measured factors using repeated measures ANOVA. Vegetation types differed significantly in water-table depth, water pH and Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and N-NO3- content. The concentration of major nutrients fluctuated noticeably during vegetation season and displayed large variation within vegetation types. Temporarily the concentration of different nutrients reached extremely high values. However, high nutrient supply has not altered the gradient structure of the vegetation. Water pH and water-table depths were found to be two major determinants of species variation in fishpond-margin fens, as in the majority of other environments studied throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Species richness of both vascular plants and bryophytes was partly explained by pH. However, the extent of variation in total mineral richness and potassium concentration were the next two most important variables determining bryophyte species richness. Water in flooded poor-fen vegetation, directly affected by water from limed fishponds, had calcium and magnesium concentration similar to fishpond water. The calcium concentrations of about 20 mg l(-1) in typical poor-fen vegetation have no analogy in the ecological literature. High phosphorus level presumably buffers the effect of calcium by enhancing bryophyte biomass depositing superfluous calcium. In conclusion, extremely high long-term nutrient supply to fishpond-margin fens have not altered gradient structure, but shifted chemical limits of plant communities.

AB Linear infrastructures are known to facilitate the spread of undesirable species in ecosystems. Compared with other types of infrastructure, the role of power line rights-of-way (ROWs) as dispersal vectors remains poorly understood, especially with regard to peatlands. The aim of our study was to evaluate their impacts on the vegetation of ombrotrophic (bog) and minerotrophic (fen) peatlands. The vegetation communities within and adjacent to power line ROWs were sampled in 23 bogs and 11 fens in southern Quebec. In fens, invasive species were found in abundance along the first 250 m within ROWs, while native non-peatland species were able to spread into entire ROWs. Invasive species were also able to colonize the adjacent fen habitats but were mostly concentrated in the first 4 m from ROW edges. Some species were, however, able to establish at more than 43 m from ROWs. Invasive and native non-peatland species were mostly restricted to the first 31 m within ROWs intersecting a bog and almost none dispersed in the adjacent bog habitats. Overall, the average cover of native non-peatland and invasive species in ROWs was mostly related to intrinsic abiotic conditions such as water pH, water conductivity, and water table level, while landscape surrounding the peatland and historical variables (e. g., time elapse since the construction of the ROW) had few impacts in both bogs and fens.

AB Modern period long-term human and climatic impacts on a small mire in the Jura Mountains were assessed using testate amoebae, macrofossils and pollen. This multiproxy data analysis permitted detailed interpretations of local and regional environmental change and thus a partial disentanglement of the different variables that influence long-term mire development. From the Middle Ages until A. D. 1700 the mire vegetation was characterised by ferns, Caltha and Vaccinium, but then abruptly changed into the modern vegetation characterised by Cyperaceae, Potentilla and Sphagnum. The cause for this change was most probably deforestation, possibly enhanced by climatic cooling. A decrease in trampling intensity by domestic animals from A. D. 1950 onwards allowed Sphagnum growth and climatic warming in the A. D. 1980s and 1990s may have been responsible for considerable changes in the species composition. The mire investigated is an example of the rapid changes in mire vegetation and peat development that occurred throughout the central European mountain region during the past centuries as a result of changing climate and land-use practice. These processes are still active today and will determine the future development of high-altitude mires.

AB This study of the Kanna calcareous spring fen on Saaremaa, the largest island of Estonia, elucidates its history of fen development and vegetation diversity over the last 9,200 years. Pollen, spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, macrofossils, loss-on-ignition and humification index analyses were carried out to reconstruct fen succession, vegetation development, environmental changes and human impact. Hierarchical clustering, ordination analysis and linear regression were applied to examine the vegetation composition and richness patterns through time and to identify the potential environmental drivers underlying these patterns. Our results suggest reverse mire development from bog to fen, a rare occurrence and contrary to typical mire autogenic succession from groundwater fed to rainwater fed. Kanna developed as a small bog for the first 2,000 years from 9,200 to 7,200 cal yrs bp. Changes to the hydrological regime around 7,200 cal yrs bp, due to a warmer and drier climate and land uplift, caused a change from an ombrotrophic to a minerotrophic environment. Typical spring fen characteristics developed ca. 5,000 cal yrs bp and continued until ca. 400 cal yrs bp, when the fen was fed by calcareous mineral-rich groundwater and reached very high floristic diversity with various calciphilous and relict plant taxa. We conclude that general changes in the Kanna fen succession, vegetation community and diversity are associated with climatic changes. The present high diversity of the fen is a result of a long-term stable fen environment, which may have been even higher in the past. However, the pollen richness has decreased during the last 400 years, possibly due to human or natural factors.

AB 1. The effect of water level drawdown after drainage of mires for forestry was studied by comparing the vegetation on undrained pine-mire sites with that of sites drained 3-55 years earlier. The plant communities were analysed with respect to the following environmental variables: drainage age, total nutrient contents of surface pear, and tree stand characteristics. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to relate the environmental variables to data on the botanical composition of vegetation.
   2. Two main gradients were found in the data. The first ordination axis clearly relates to a gradient in forest vegetation succession and the second axis to a gradient in peat nutrient level and pH.
   3. The secondary succession towards forest vegetation started soon after drainage and proceeded most rapidly in the most nutrient-rich site types. This led to a more uniform vegetation composition between the site types.
   4. Original mire species reacted differently to the changing post-drainage environment. Tall sedges (Carex lasiocarpa, C. rostrata) disappeared soon after drainage. The coverages of the mire dwarf shrubs gradually decreased with increasing tree stand volumes; Betula nana appears to have been the most sensitive species. The coverages of the Sphagna studied appear to have decreased in response to increasing tree stand shading in the order: S. fuscum > S. recurvum complex > S. magellanicum > S. russowii.
   5. The development towards forest vegetation on mires may diminish the regional (gamma-) diversity on forest-dominated landscapes, even if the species (alpha-) diversity on individual sites is little affected.
   6. Long-term vegetation changes after artificial water level drawdown, emphasized in this study, can be used to mimic the effects of the predicted global climatic warming on mire vegetation.

AB Peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum constitute the bulk of living and dead biomass in bogs. These plants contain peculiar polyphenols which hamper litter peat decomposition through their inhibitory activity on microbial breakdown. In the light of the increasing availability of biologically active nitrogen in natural ecosystems, litter derived from Sphagnum mosses is an ideal substrate to test the potential effects of increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition on polyphenol content in litter peat. To this aim, we measured total nitrogen and soluble polyphenol concentration in Sphagnum litter peat collected in I I European bogs under a chronic gradient of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Our results demonstrate that increasing nitrogen concentration in Sphagnum litter, as a consequence of increased exogenous nitrogen availability, is accompanied by a decreasing concentration of polyphenols. This inverse relationship is consistent with reports that in Sphagnum mosses, polyphenol and protein biosynthesis compete for the same precursor. Our observation of modified Sphagnum litter chemistry under chronic nitrogen eutrophication has implications in the context of the global carbon balance, because a lower content of decay-inhibiting polyphenols would accelerate litter peat decomposition.

AB Despite being a significant input into soil carbon pools of many high-latitude ecosystems, little is known about the effects of climate change on the turnover of mycorrhizal fungal necromass. Here, we present results from the first experiment examining the effects of climate change on the long-term decomposition of mycorrhizal necromass, utilising the Spruce and Peatland Response Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. Warming significantly increased necromass decomposition rates but was strongest in normally submerged microsites where warming caused water table drawdown. Necromass chemistry exerted the strongest control on the decomposition, with initial nitrogen content strongly predicting early decay rates (3 months) and initial melanin content determining mass remaining after 2 years. Collectively, our results suggest that as global temperatures rise, variation in species biochemical traits as well as microsites where mycorrhizal necromass is deposited will determine how these important inputs contribute to the belowground storage of carbon in boreal peatlands.

AB We studied the effects of N deposition on shrub-moss competition and the establishment and growth of invasive Betula pubescens and Molinia caerulea in intact bog vegetation removed from a site subject to 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1).
   Mesocosms with and without introduced Betula seedlings and Molinia sprouts were kept under a roof and received an equivalent of 0, 40 and 80 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for two growing seasons.
   N concentration in both interstitial water and Sphagnum decreased when N input ceased and increased when N input was doubled. Molinia biomass was positively related to the inorganic N concentration in the interstitial water. Adding N increased production of Molinia and prolonged survival of Betula seedlings in the first year. Sphagnum height increment showed a hump-shaped relationship with light interception by vascular plants.
   N deposition encouraged vascular plants to grow by enhancing N availability in the rhizosphere. Water table level and the availability of P were found to be important in explaining species-specific responses to N deposition. The underlying mechanisms and the reversibility of N effects are discussed.

AB In recent decades, the extent of Sasa palmata-dominant communities has increased in Sarobetsu Mire in northern Hokkaido, Japan, replacing the original Sphagnum bog vegetation. However, this marked increase in distribution of Sasa in the mire has not been formally documented or investigated in detail. Using aerial photo-interpretation, the present study updated the distribution maps of Sasa communities, showing the changes that have occurred to these communities between 1977 and 2003. The results revealed that the extent of Sasa communities has increased by 15.8 % from 6.60 km(2) in 1977 to 7.64 km(2) in 2003. The most marked increase occurred on the ground associated with drainage channels, although the oldest channels were constructed more than half a century ago, suggesting that some responses to the drainage of peat bog ecosystems may take a considerable period of time before becoming particularly evident.

AB 1 The influence of tephra (aerially transported volcanic ejecta) on mire vegetation was investigated in a field experiment at Sarobetsu Mire, northern Hokkaido, Japan, which simulated relatively thin, widespread tephras. It was carried out in the centre of a raised part of the mire in a Carex middendorffii-Sphagnum papillosum community.
   2 We tested the effects of varying tephra layer thickness, grain size and season of the simulated tephra impact.
   3 Vegetation surveys and analyses of the mire pore water were carried out before and 1 and 2 years after tephra application. Redox potential, oxygen saturation and sulphide concentration were measured in the surface layer of selected plots after 10 months.
   4 Pore water chemistry and oxygen saturation changed significantly in some treatments. Some plant species disappeared from certain treatments after tephra application, but the majority survived. Colonization by non-mire species played a significant role in only one treatment. Mosses were more strongly affected by the disturbance than vascular plants.
   5 Tephra had stronger effects on the vegetation when layers were thicker, were more fine-grained and when applied at the beginning rather than at the end of the growing season.
   6 Moderate tephra deposition is unlikely to cause long-term changes in mire development. Subsequent succession depends on properties of the tephra, on the vegetation type (e.g. life-forms) and on the season, but the original vegetation will probably recover even where the moss layer is severely damaged, as Sphagnum spp. can re-establish by growing through tephra at least up to 6 cm thick.

AB Vegetation analyses (phytosociological releves) of 20 peat bogs arranged along an altitudinal gradient in the southern part of the Czech Republic, Central Europe, revealed relationships between vegetation and environmental gradients. Six of the peat bogs were investigated in detail. The bogs were dominated by Pinus rotundata, a species endemic to Central Europe, and its hybridogenous populations with R mugo (the hybrid is called P. xpseudopumilio), with increasing proportions of the latter at higher altitudes. Data were processed using indirect (DCA) and direct (CCA) gradient analyses. Environmental variables (depth of the water table, mean and minimum temperatures, precipitation, pH, conductivity, NH(4) and PO(4) concentrations, total P, but not total N nor NO(3) concentration), as well as biotic characteristics of the sites, such as species composition, and growth form of the dominant pines, were closely correlated with altitude. Woody species, herbs and bryophytes responded to the altitude similarly. Results also indicated the unique characteristics of each bog.

ID AGE CALIBRATION; RECORD; DISCRIMINATION
AB The carbon isotope ratios of bog peat in the Ozegahara peatland, Japan, were measured. The vertical variation of the bulk peat featured: 1) rapid decrease of the carbon isotope ratio (delta(13)C) near the surface, 2) broad rises in the ratio around depths corresponding to 3000, 5500, 7500 years BP with a period of approximately 2500 years, and 3) a further decrease toward the bottom. In order to understand the reasons for the changes, peat components were separated and their isotopic composition measured along with modern peat-forming vegetation. The selective decay of holocellulose is responsible for the rapid decrease of delta(13)C in the surface layers, and the transition from earlier vegetation caused the further decrease of delta(13)C near the bottom. The decay constant for holocellulose was estimated to be as small as 0.001 yr(-1). The variation of delta(13)C seemed to be synchronized with sea level change, but showed poor correlation with solar activity and the temperature change estimated from pollen analysis. The delta(13)C of peat mosses lacking in stomata would increase with the rise in atmospheric CO2. The increase in the atmospheric CO2 occurring synchronously with sea level rise could be the reason for the periodical change. Some climatic information of the Holocene period may have been recorded in the Ozegahara bog peat.

AB The Jegrznia floodplain has been deprived of flooding since the late 19th century. Human influence has been limited to haymaking and cattle grazing without land reclamation. Therefore, the present vegetation reflects the impact of hydrological changes, without being much disturbed by changes in other factors. A drainage gradient on the former floodplain was examined for nutrient deficiencies and compared with an intact floodplain. For this purpose we analyzed nutrient concentrations in aboveground biomass, we measured redox potentials and peat variables for a rich fen vegetation, a well-developed fen meadow as well as an impoverished fen meadow vegetation. According to P:N-ratios in above ground biomass, all vegetation types appear to be limited by phosphorus, whereas the impoverished fen meadow is also limited by potassium. These results are supported by the chemical composition of the peat, redox characteristics and the physical changes in the peat induced by drainage. It is concluded that hydrological changes in combination with an annual mowing regime resulted in a shift from no nutrient limitation to P- and/or K-limitation in the former Jegrznia floodplain. Changes in hydrology at Jegrznia stopped the input of nutrients, increased the leaching of K and turned P into unavailable Al and Fe-complexes. Continued mowing increased P- and K-deficiency.

AB Increasing human activity continues to threaten peatlands, and as the area of natural mires declines, our obligation is to restore their ecosystem functions. Several restoration strategies have been developed for restoration of extracted peatlands, including "The moss layer transfer method", which was initiated on the Tassi extracted peatland in central Estonia in May 2012. Three-year study shows that despite the fluctuating water table, rainfall events can compensate for the insufficient moisture for mosses. Total plant cover on the restoration area attained 70 %, of which similar to 60 % is comprised of target species-Sphagnum mosses. From restoration treatments, spreading of plant fragments had a significant positive effect on the cover of bryophyte and vascular plants. Higher water table combined with higher plant fragments spreading density and stripping of oxidised peat layer affected positively the cover of targeted Sphagnum species. The species composition in the restoration area became similar to that in the donor site in a natural bog. Based on results, it was concluded that the method approved for restoration in North America gives good results also in the restoration of extracted peatland towards re-establishment of bog vegetation under northern European conditions.

AB 1. Groundwater-peatland interactions were assessed by a regional survey in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, where the rapid rate of isostatic uplift has perturbed hydrological flow systems across a 6000-year chronosequence.
   2. A 24 000 km(2) study area along the Albany River consists of 55% fen, 35% bog and 10% mineral soil. The peatland vegetation may be further subdivided into 11 noda, which are closely related to different water levels, ranges in water chemistry, and peat landform type. Species richness generally declines with increasing water level and acidity, whereas the gradient from bog to extremely rich fen is marked by the changing abundance and occurrence of fen-indicator species.
   3. Bog landforms are restricted to physiographic settings where surface waters flow downwards and the bog vegetation is therefore isotated from the influence of geogenous waters. In contrast, fens are located in areas where mineral solutes are transported to the peat surface either by upwelling groundwater or by advective/dispersion along lateral flow paths.
   4. Peatlands spread across the study area between 6000 and 3000 BP, coinciding with the emergence of new land from the sea. The release of organic acids from the nearly continuous peat cover acidified this calcareous landscape, leading to the convergence of the surface-water chemistry into four discrete groupings of pH vs. calcium.
   5. Isostatic uplift, however, continues to alter the topography, fluvial geometry and groundwater flow systems of the lowlands, maintaining diverse peatland types on land surfaces of similar age. The formation of water-table mounds under the interfluvial divides and rising moraine system spurred the development of raised bogs, whereas the formation of regional seepage faces for goundwater on the margins of the moraine and rivers of the till plain maintains large areas of fen.
   6. Although peatland succession seems to follow predictable pathways within a given hydrogeological setting, these pathways are locally altered by tectonic drivers that continually modify surface and groundwater flow systems. In this large peat basin the pace and pathway of peatland succession seems to be driven by tectonic rather than climatic forcing.

AB A 72 cm peat core from a spring mire reveals 3300 years of vegetation history in the Hoher Flaming, a landscape formed by the penultimate glaciation in southeastern Brandenburg. Primeval beech-oak forest dominated from A.D. 550 to 1200, prior to local forest clearance. Existing maps showing the natural and potential natural vegetation as pine and oak need to be revised. Local woodland cutting in the 12th century and grassland use since the 15th century affected the development of the helokrene (spring-fed) mire deposits from alder carr to mesotrophic fen vegetation and then to the present-day Sphagnum fallax-Juncus acutiflorus wet meadows. Vegetation and mire history link together the Hoher Flaming and adjacent landscapes on a northwest-southeast gradient of suboceanic to subcontinental climate. Moreover it represents a geographical and altitudinal transition of lowland and hill vegetation from 30 to 200 m a.s.l. to the montane belts of the palynologically well investigated Harz mountains. However, regarding some trees and herbs, the Hoher Flaming does not belong to the Hercynian region and type of vegetation.

AB The vegetation succession in a floating mire was studied in relation to management and hydrological conditions in a former peat cutting area in the northern part of the Netherlands. An existing map showed that in 1956 the vegetation consisted mainly of meadows, reedbeds and rich fen vegetation while a recent survey revealed that this picture had completely changed in 1989. The area had mainly become woodland but part had remained open, due to the continuation of a mowing regime. The timing of the mowing appears to be critical, especially during the earlier phases of the succession. Winter-mowing favours the development of eutrophic reedbeds, while summer-mowing promotes mesotrophic sedge communities. In the course of time these succession lines converge increasingly towards acidic vegetation types.
   The development from open water to embryonic bog differed greatly between sites with a similar management regime. Mostly this took only a few decades but in a few sites the vegetation had hardly changed since 1956. Whereas the former sites were acid throughout the profile, the latter showed a high pH from top to bottom. It is obvious that acidification does not occur as long as alkaline surface water can move freely underneath the floating mat. As soon as a given site becomes disconnected from the surface water the depletion of bases by infiltrating rainwater is no longer compensated. A rough estimate of the acidification rate shows that in an infiltration area three decades are sufficient for a floating mat of 40 cm to become completely decalcified. This corresponds well to the observed succession from rich fens to embryonic bogs in the same period. It is suggested that the best way to preserve rich fen vegetation is to start the succession anew by digging turf ponds.

AB This work presents a methodology based on Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) RGB imagery for the analysis and characterization of the structure and condition of complex habitat mosaics of high conservation value in mountain wetlands. Structure from Motion (SfM) image reconstruction techniques were applied on a collection of RGB photographs to derive ultra-high resolution (2,5 cm) digital surface models and ortho-mosaics. Geographical object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) was used for the automatic discrimination of vegetation types for habitat condition assessment via multi-scale object-oriented classifications integrating machine learning classification techniques with other decision rules. In particular, four vegetation classes were assessed, namely woody vegetation (scrub plants higher than 10 cm), bog herbaceous vegetation, non-bog herbaceous vegetation (as part of wet heathland vegetation mosaics) and areas with scarce or no vegetation (rocky habitats and areas of bare ground). The outputs of the classification were validated against field data of detailed vegetation coverage survey. Results allowed us the automatic and accurate discrimination of habitat types with different management demands, e.g. wet heaths against bogs, as well as the diagnosis of structural characteristics critical for their conservation, such as the ratio of cover herbaceous/woody species or the presence of erosion features.

AB 1 Inferences about the processes leading to surface patterning, pool formation and gully erosion in a Southern Pennine blanket mire are drawn from the 15-m stratigraphic profile from Alport Moor described in Part I.
   2 Four successive stages in the development of the present mire surface are recognized: a topographically differentiated dry bog vegetation c. 2800 years ago, which then developed into a wet rather featureless mire surface by c. 200 Cal BC; an extended phase between c. 200 Cal BC and 1250 Cal AD when hummock-hollow differentiation was taking place over the mire surface; and drier bog vegetation since c. 1250 Cal AD, probably following incision of the main drainage gullies.
   3 Preserved remains of Sphangnum occurred in 52% of the peat samples analysed for macrofossils. In the peat profile the Sphagnum remains were concentrated into five essentially continuous and nearly horizontal bands, separated by intervening regions where Sphagnum was scarce or absent.
   4 The temporary discontinuous distribution of Sphagnum in the stratigraphic profile is shown to be an overall response to climate change (Sphagna increasing in abundance during periods of wetter climate), modified by site-specific responses to ongoing topographic differentiation and the incidence of erosion.
   5 It is suggested that high pollen values of Cyperaceae found in the pollen record from Alport Moor and some other Southern Pennine sites might record the local spread of Eriophorum angustifolium across bare wet peat, and might thus indicate times when the mire surface was under stress.
   6 Site-specific differences in the patterns of Sphagnum abundance over the last 1200 years in the study area and on the nearby Featherbed Moss are used to follow the development of the erosion system on Alport Moor.
   7 The currently eroded mire surface on much of Alport Moor has arisen from at least three processes acting on the pool-and-hummock system: (a) the drawing-off of water from the pools by endotelmic streams extending headwards from the main streams of the catchment area, probably at least 1000 years ago; (b) extensive drying-out of pools and hummocks during the drier climatic conditions between c. AD 1150 and 1300; (c) subsequent human modification of the mire vegetation by burning, grazing and, latterly, air pollution.
   8 Sphagnum was lost from the mire surface generally on Alport Moor by 400-500 years ago. Only the disappearance of the moss Racomitrium lanuginosum from the hummocks might be attributed to the deleterious effects of air pollution.

AB A structured, spatially explicit assessment of the distribution of heath and mire in Northern Ireland, based on land classification, is developed. This gives perspective to land use and ecological resources in the uplands of Northern Ireland (NI) and increases the ecological information available to land use decision-makers. Thus the area of intact, unmanaged ombrotrophic mire, defined by vegetation community criteria, was estimated as 9% (157 km(2)) of the upland heath and mire vegetation in NI. This represents 1.2% of the land area of NI and emphasises the nature conservation importance of the resource.
   Stepwise forward selection and canonical correspondence analysis, based on a stratified vegetation, environment and management sampling programme, indicate the relative importance of factors associated with the composition of ombrotrophic mire. Slope, degree of waterlogging and peat depth were the main environment attributes governing composition. There was also major association between biogeographic location and vegetation community composition, indicating the importance of spatial variation in conservation management strategies. Grazing intensity was shown to be the main management factor associated with variation in species composition. Burning, disturbance and structural intactness of the peat profile had secondary effects. Relationships between different types of management and site locational attributes, demonstrated formally within the model, show that peatland management strategies need to consider spatial variation at the landscape scale.

AB The Holocene development of a peculiar coastal peatland (raised bog Svinoye), southern Curonian Spit, Russia, is reconstructed based on the analysis of taxonomic diversity of plant macrofossils and radiocarbon dating of peat and gyttja deposits. The development of the bog can be referred to the primary mire formation, which was preceded by a period of gyttja accumulation (7500-7000 cal. yr BP) in a shallow water body. The mire vegetation development started from 7000 cal. yr BP through the spread of the alder carrs and reed stretches that presumably experienced inundation during transgression events of the forming Baltic over the period 7000-6300 cal. yr BP). These habitats were successively replaced by the communities of the rich fen, transition mire and active raised bog. During the whole post-transgression period (6300 cal. yr BP - present time), the vegetation successions were not influenced by the sea-level oscillations but were determined by climatic and anthropogenic factors. The diagrams of the botanical composition of peat enabled to assign and describe 12 formation phases for the Svinoye bog ecosystem. In contrast to the other peatlands in the region, the stage of transition mire persisted here over a long-term period of 1200 years. The formation of a typical raised bog began around 3400 cal. yr BP. As recent as 200 years ago, the ecosystem had the characteristics of a maritime climate mire. The mean peat accumulation rate was defined for the period of the last 7000 year as having the highest values in the Late Atlantic and the Late Sub-Atlantic (1.7-2 mm/yr), while the lowest increment (0.8 mm/yr) is recorded for the whole Sub-Boreal.

AB Major regime shifts in mires such as the fen-bog transition and the transition from non-forested to forested peatland are driven by ecohydrological changes. However, little is known about how the magnitudes and/or durations of hydrological shifts relate to these regime shifts. Here we analyse long-term water table data in conjunction with plant community data collected from primary mires on the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. These ecosystems represent various stages of drainage: undrained, drained sites with developing tree stands, and unsuccessfully drained sites not supporting tree encroachment. The varying success of drainage provides an ideal field laboratory for investigation of thresholds of water table control on the successional trajectories of primary mire. Our data indicate a likely mechanism for the control of vegetation regime shifts in northern peatlands by water table, with time of year being as important a factor as the magnitude of change. Spring flooding rather than summer water table level appeared to be crucial for controlling state shifts in primary mire vegetation. As the effects of climate change on peatlands are most likely to be mediated by changes in hydrology and water table level, our study indicates a need for more thorough investigation of seasonal variability in the controlling factors.

AB In the Alpine mountains, mire systems are found in the form of small, scattered landscape units. Nevertheless, they maintain noticeably high diversity in terms of plant specialists and community types. A unique, species-rich example in the central Pyrenees, Bassa Nera, is analysed here by describing the major gradients that drive species composition and their relationship with abiotic drivers. We studied the specific vegetation composition, water chemistry and seasonal dynamics of the water table at 35 sampling points. The floristic data confirmed the uniqueness of Bassa Nera in relation to similar Pyrenean mire systems, both in terms of total species richness and regionally rare mire specialists. We distinguished seven plant community types and identified the depth to the water table as the principal driver of the variation in species composition. The water chemistry determined smaller composition shifts, since variations in pH and cationic contents were moderate. Flooded areas were species poor whereas soligenous sub-alkaline fens supported the highest numbers of species. However, the harshest mire habitats (floating Sphagnum carpets and Sphagnum hummocks) stood out as they included the highest number of rare plants within relatively species-poor assemblages. Therefore, the high species richness and uniqueness of the Bassa Nera system mirrors a combination of a wide range of hydrological conditions and a moderate variation in water chemistry. This case study reveals how a few mire systems stand out as exceptional sites. Thus, in Alpine ranges a thorough survey on mire vegetation is needed to select and effectively protect these threatened relict ecosystems.

AB Fens with their specialized plant communities are strictly protected in Europe. However, solid baseline data on fen development in relation to climate and landuse changes are hardly available. In order to close these gaps, long term studies are needed. This study investigates changes of fen vegetation at two locations in the Central Alps (inner Otz valley, Tyrol, Austria) by comparing releves from 1971 and 2014.
   In both fens species diversity increased. One former fen developed into a raised bog till 2014. Species number doubled, presumably cause of spatial differentiated vegetation development. The other location is characterized by two plant communities: the Amblystegio intermedii-Scirpetum austriaci where species number doubled within 40 years, and the Caricetum goodenowii which hardly changed. Species composition of both sites changed, but not with a trend to raised bog character.
   Since autogenic processes of vegetation development in fens need time, it can be hypothesized that allogenic processes or a mixture of both processes caused the detected species composition changes. Climate and landuse changes, especially climate warming and changes in pasture and forestry use and ski tourism with the therefore taken physical alterations, may be the most important driving forces.

AB 1 The gradient relations proposed by Wheeler & Proctor for NW European mires were tested for six Carex species common in north Japanese mires. Hydrochemical properties of their preferred habitats were compared with above-ground biomass data.
   2 Canonical discriminant analysis showed that soil water pH was the strongest discriminant between habitats of the Carex species, with total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentration also contributing, independently of pH.
   3 Two major patterns were apparent in the distribution of Carex species: pH determines a bimodal distribution into fens with pH > 5.0 and bogs with pH < 5.5, whilst TDN captures the variation in above-ground biomass within both fen and bog, but does not differ significantly between them.
   4 Concentrations of Ca and Mg were low throughout the pH range. The floristic gradients associated with base richness seen in Euramerican mires do not therefore apply in north Japanese mires, where periodic flooding with neutral water removes the acid fractions in fens, and is the major determinant of pH.
   5 Thus, pH is the best variable for distinguishing between fen and bog, as the poor fen-rich fen classification is inappropriate for non-calcareous north Japanese mires.

AB Quaking rich fens dominated by boreal semi-aquatic brown-mosses such as Scorpidium scorpioides and Calliergon trifarium are extremely rare in the Carpathians. These fens harbour endangered species persisting at few localities in the region. However, their phytosociological classification has not been sufficiently solved yet, because they lack Sphagnum species as well as calcicole species characteristic for the Caricion davallianae alliance. A recent pan-European synthesis on fen vegetation suggests that these fens belong to the Stygio-Caricion limosae alliance (boreal rich fen vegetation). The isolated occurrence of this alliance southward of the boreal zone and outside the Alps is rather exceptional and might represent a relict from an early post-glacial period. In this study, we compared phytosociological data for the Stygio-Caricion limosae alliance between Northern Europe and the Carpathians plus adjacent regions (the Bohemian Massif, the Dinaric Alps) using NMDS and cluster analysis. We found that the species composition of brown-moss quaking rich fens in Central and Southeastern Europe corresponds well with that in Northern Europe, confirming their assignment to Stygio-Caricion limosae. We further reconstructed the potential past distribution of the alliance in Czech Republic and Slovakia using available floristic and macrofossil data. Macrofossil data suggest that this vegetation type had been much more common in Central Europe and that today it persists only in ancient fens, showing the long-term stability of environmental conditions. The main causes of its present-day rarity are Middle-Holocene woodland phases in fens and recent water table decreases caused by anthropogenic deterioration of the water regime in the landscape.

AB Peatlands form a large carbon (C) pool but their C sink is labile and susceptible to changes in climate and land-use. Some pristine peatlands are forested, and others have the potential: the amount of arboreal vegetation is likely to increase if soil water levels are lowered as a consequence of climate change. On those sites tree litter dynamics may be crucial for the C balance. We studied the decomposition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needle and root litter in boreal peatland sites representing gradients in drainage succession (succession following water level drawdown caused by forest drainage) and soil nutrient level during several years of varying weather conditions. Neither gradient had an unambiguous effect on litter mass loss. Mass loss over 2 years was faster in undrained versus drained sites for both needle litter, incubated in the moss layer, and fine root litter, incubated in 0-10 cm peat layer, suggesting moisture stress in the surface layers of the drained sites limited decomposition. Differences among the drained sites were not consistent. Among years, mass loss correlated positively with precipitation variables, and mostly negatively or not at all with temperature sum. We concluded that a long-term water level drawdown in peatlands does not necessarily enhance decay of fresh organic matter. Instead, the drained site may turn into a 'large hummock-system' where several factors, including litter quality, relative moisture deficiency, higher acidity, lower substrate temperature, and in deeper layers also oxygen deficiency, may interact to constrain organic matter decomposition. Further, the decomposition rates may not vary systematically among sites of different soil nutrient levels following water level drawdown. Our results emphasize the importance of annual weather variations on decomposition rates, and demonstrate that single-period incubation studies incorporate an indeterminable amount of temporal variation.

AB The major environmental gradients underlying plant species distribution were outlined in two climatically and bio-geographically contrasting mires: a Swedish bog in the boreo-nemoral zone, and an Italian bog in the south-eastern Alps. Data on mire morphology, surface hydrology, floristic composition, peat chemistry and pore-water chemistry were collected along transects from the mire margin (i.e., the outer portion of the mire in contact with the surrounding mineral soil) towards the mire expanse (i.e., the inner portion of the mire). The delimitation and the extent of the minerotrophic mire margin were related to the steepness of the lateral mire slope which, in turns, controls the direction of surface water flow. The mineral soil water limit was mirrored in geochemical variables such as pH, alkalinity, Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Mn2+, and SiO2 concentrations in pore-water, as well as Ca, Al, Fe, N and P contents in surface peat. Depending on regional requirements of plant species, different species were useful as fen limit indicators at the two sites. The main environmental factors affecting distribution of habitat types and plant species in the two mires were the acidity-alkalinity gradient, and the gradient in depth to the water table. The mire margin - mire expanse gradient corresponds to a complex gradient mainly reflected in a differentiation of vegetation structure in relation to the aeration of the peat substrate.

AB 1 We studied the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and increased N deposition on the plant species composition of a Sphagnum-dominated bog ecosystem in the Netherlands. Large peat monoliths (surface area 1 m(2), depth 0.6 m) with intact bog vegetation were kept outdoors in large containers and were exposed to elevated CO2 or increased N deposition for three growing seasons. Elevated CO2 conditions (target concentration 560 mu mol CO2 mol(-1)) were created using MiniFACE technology. In a separate experiment, N deposition was increased by 5 g N m(-2) year(-1) by adding dissolved NH4NO3 at 3 week intervals during the growing season.
   2 Elevated atmospheric CO2 increased height growth of Sphagnum magellanicum, the dominant Sphagnum species, in the second and third growing seasons. Vascular plant biomass was not significantly affected by elevated CO2, but growth of species growing close to the moss surface was influenced negatively by the increased Sphagnum height growth. Elevated CO2 did not change allocation to below-ground plant parts.
   3 Adding N increased above-ground vascular plant biomass. The shallow-rooted species Vaccinium oxycoccus responded most to the increased N deposition. Sphagnum growth was significantly reduced in the third growing season. This reduction was likely the result of the increased vascular plant cover, given the observed negative relation between vascular plant cover and Sphagnum growth.
   4 The observed shifts in species composition as a result of species-specific responses to treatments, and interactions between peat mosses and vascular plants will have important consequences for the sequestration of carbon in the bog ecosystem.

AB The ecological structure of boreal mire margin vegetation (paludified forests, mire margin forests and forested pine and spruce mires) in South and Central Finland was examined using ordination (DCA) and classification (TWINSPAN) techniques on the vegetation data of 92 sample plots from the 8th National Forest Inventory (1985-86). The first DCA axis was interpreted as respond to a complex-gradient of nutrient availability on the basis of site classification, species composition and correlation with all measured tree stand variables. According to the distribution of species ecological groups along DCA1 axis the mire margin/mire expanse gradient was one of the main factors determining this nutrient availability. The second axis was interpreted in terms of paludification on the basis of species composition, site classification and its correlation with peat depth. Seven clusters resulted from a TWINSPAN classification of the vegetation data. These could be arranged into a sequence along the nutrient availability gradient by their species composition: three clusters represented ombro-oligotrophic, three clusters meso-oligotrophic and one cluster mesotrophic vegetation. The clusters corresponded only weakly to the traditional Finnish forest and mire site types as determined in the field.

AB To provide a reference for wetlands elsewhere we analysed soil nutrients and the vegetation of floodplains and fens in the relatively undisturbed Biebrza-valley, Poland. Additionally, by studying sites along a water-table gradient, and by comparing pairs of mown and unmown sites, we aimed with exploring long-term effects of drainage and annual hay-removal on nutrient availabilities and vegetation response. In undrained fens and floodplains, N mineralization went slowly (0-30 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) but it increased strongly with decreasing water table (up to 120 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Soil N, P and K pools were small in the undisturbed mires. Drainage had caused a shift from fen to meadow species and the disappearance of bryophytes. Biomass of vascular plants increased with increasing N mineralization and soil P. Annual hay-removal tended to have reduced N mineralization and soil K pools, but it had increased soil P. Moreover, N concentrations in vascular plants were not affected, but P and K concentrations and therefore N:P and N:K ratios tended to be changed. Annual hay-removal had induced a shift from P to K limitation in the severely drained fen, and from P to N limitation in the floodplain. The low nutrient availabilities and productivity of the undisturbed Biebrza mires illustrate the vulnerability of such mires to eutrophication in Poland and elsewhere. In nutrient-enriched areas, hay removal may prevent productivity increase of the vegetation, but also may severely alter N:P:K stoichiometry, induce K-limitation at drained sites, and alter vegetation structure and composition.

TI Schoenetum nigricantis, the Schoenus fen and flush vegetation of Ireland
SO BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY
LA English
DT Article
AB Fen and wet flush vegetation in Ireland that is dominated by Schoenus nigricans is described in this paper, which is based on analysis of 108 releves, 46 taken by the authors during a field survey and 62 gleaned horn documentary sources. The conservation importance of fen vegetation in which Schoenus is dominant is recognised at European Union level. In Ireland such vegetation is found in well-established flushes that are ungrazed or only lightly grazed, and in base-rich fens. Water pH in such habitats ranges from 5.0 to 8.1. The Schoenus fen and flush vegetation in Ireland has a distinctive synmorphology, with pronounced Schoenus-tussock formation combined with inter-tussock erosion to give a characteristic vegetation mosaic. Acidification of tussock tops allows development of a calcifuge vegetation component, including Myrica gale and Narthecium ossifragum, presenting a contrast to calcicole elements, such as Scorpidium scorpioides, that are typical of the tussock interspaces. This survey supports the assignment of Schoenus-dominated vegetation in Ireland to the Schoenetum nigricantis (Allorge 1922) Koch 1926, an association that belongs to the Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae (Nordh. 1936) Tx. 1937 em. Tx. 1980, the Caricetalia davallianae Br.-Bl. 1949, and the Caricion davallianae Klika 1934. From the analysis presented here, there appears to be little justification for the inclusion of such Irish vegetation in the separate Atlantic association, Cirsio dissecti-Schoenetum nigricantis, defined by Braun-Blanquet and Tuxen (1952). The present survey indicates that Cirsium dissectum is confined to drier stands and that the distinctive synmorphology of Schoenus-dominated vegetation warrants its inclusion in a single association. Habitat variation and floristic differentiation within Schoenus-dominated fen and flush vegetation in Ireland may be defined at the subassociation level: (a) caricetosum lasiocarpae, typical of topogenous habitats in extensive fens, (b) eleocharetosum multicaulis, a more rheotrophic vegetation, often found in flushes in otherwise base-poor situations, and (c) cirsietosum dissecti, typical of the drier habitats for Schoenus.

AB Holocene lateral expansion and carbon accumulation within Luovuoma, a northern fen in Finnish Lapland, were examined utilizing stratigraphy, peat properties such as humification and macrofossil composition, 58 radio-carbon dates and the carbon content of 31 volumetric samples, in an attempt to understand variations in carbon accumulation over time. Paludification started about 9800 years ago. The lateral expansion of the mire was most rapid during phases subsequent to the first signs of paludification, with the result that by 5000 cal. yr BP 79% of the present area of Luovuoma supported mire vegetation. The mire initially expanded laterally at a relatively fast rate with an irregular outline, and only gradually attained its more regular existing form. This is corroborated by the amounts of carbon accumulated during different times: 58% of the carbon had formed before the time point of 5000 cal. yr BP. The long-term net carbon accumulation rate, based on the vertical and lateral growth of the peat deposit, was 11.8 g C/m(2)/yr. Variations in carbon accumulation rates can be explained to a great extent by natural succession and variable local conditions, but the role of climate cannot be ignored. A marked decline in average carbon accumulation rates (from 26 to 9 g C/m(2)/yr) during the period between 7800 and 4900 cal. yr BP may indicate a relatively dry and warm climate. The levelling out and subsequent increase in carbon accumulation rates after 4900 cal. yr BP, with special reference to the youngest areas of Luovuoma, indicates a change to a predominantly cooler and moister climate. The stratigraphy of Luovuoma suggests that carbon exchange and accumulation by the mire has always been sensitive to climatic fluctuations, which have been characteristic of the entire Holocene.

TI Impacts of cross-country ski trails on bog and fen vegetation

DT Article
DE endangered species; soil compaction; species richness; stagnant
   moisture; Trichophorum cespitosum; water logging
AB Bogs and fens are protected by the EU Habitats Directive as they harbour many specialised species and are strongly endangered. In Southern Germany, at the foothills of the Alps, a multitude of bogs and fens of high nature-conservation value still exist. Cross-country ski trails run through some of these peatlands, but little is known about the impact of the ski trails on the vegetation. In this study we analyse the impact of cross-country ski trails on site conditions, flora and vegetation of three peatland types (raised bog, calcareous fen, litter meadow) in Southern Bavaria. For each of these types we compare ski-trail plots with unaffected control plots. In all three peatland types we observed an impact of ski trails. In general, ski trails lead to a levelling of ecological gradients, soil compaction and thus, higher soil humidity. Several stress- and humidity-tolerant species benefit from the modification of the site conditions. In the calcareous fen the impact was least severe. This can be explained by the generally higher water level and lower sensitivity to soil compaction in comparison to the raised bog and the litter meadow. Within the raised bog and the litter meadow particularly Trichophorum cespitosum was favoured by waterlogging. Moreover, the raised bog developed into a transition bog associated with an increase in the number of threatened species. This development is certainly favoured by the mulching of the ski trail because the raised bog in general is not affected by regular land use. Accordingly, the raised-bog species are not adapted to disturbance and thus rarely occur on the trail. In contrast, in the regularly mown litter meadow a floristic homogenisation with less pronounced flowering aspects takes place. The litter meadow with alternating soil moisture develops into a more constantly wet habitat, because less competitive stress-tolerators are favoured by the trail and the cover of threatened species increases.

AB The 11,000-year old lake edge archaeological site of Star Carr in the Vale of Pickering of North Yorkshire is one of the most famous Mesolithic sites in Europe, and one of the earliest, dated to the period of climatic warming that immediately followed the final termination of the last ice age. One of the main reasons for this international importance is the richness of its organic artefacts, faunal assemblage and environmental data. However, recent investigations have demonstrated that these organic remains have severely deteriorated over the last 60 years due to the decay and acidification of the surrounding peat. This paper presents research into the effects on the bone (histological analysis using light and polarising microscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy, bulk collagen analysis, and amino acid analysis), antler (visual and metrical analysis, loss on ignition and Scanning Electron Microscopy) and wood (visual analysis, decay assessment tests and Scanning Electron Microscopy).

AB The ecohydrologic function of fens is characterized by feedbacks between biological and hydrologic processes. Vegetation composition is one important factor that is both responsive to the site hydrologic regime and, by providing the organic material that determines peat hydrophysical properties, influences hydrologic conditions. In this study, we investigated the relationship between vegetation type and peat soil hydraulic conductivity in fen wetlands within the Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. We used ponded infiltration tests to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of near-surface peat in mountain fens with differing vegetation, including large-sedge fens dominated by Carex aquatilis and Carex utriculata, small-sedge fens dominated by Eleocharis quinqueflora, and fens with an abundance of woody plants and mosses. Estimated hydraulic conductivities were lowest at the fens dominated by E. quinqueflora, with a median value of 1.3 x 10(-3) cm s(-1) compared with 1.3 x 10(-2) and 9.6 x 10(-3) cm s(-1), respectively, at the large-sedge and woody fens. These data help explain historical water table observations at each fen. The E. quinqueflora-dominated fens in our study area maintain a high water table with saturated conditions throughout the summer growing season. Other fens with higher-conductivity peat show a more dynamic water table that is below ground surface by late summer. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Peatlands are abundant in the boreal region of Canada but little is known about their restoration on oil sands well pads. The goal of this study is to compare the reintroduction of different peatland plant communities and substrate amendments/decompaction in order to rehabilitate peatland vegetation on former in situ well pads constructed in wetlands. One field experiment tested which peatland plant communities (Shrubby Rich Fen, Treed Rich Fen) would best colonize different substrates (sawdust, clay loam, mix sawdust-clay, peat, surface roughness). We found that the moss layer transfer technique (MLTT) facilitated the establishment of peatland communities on residual mineral soil used to construct the pad, when shaved back to an average water level of the surrounding wetland. The choice of peatland plant community is key to the introduction of bryophytes. Peat amendment facilitated the establishment of plants, whereas soil decompaction had no effect. The MLTT is a promising approach to restore fen plants on well pads. We recommend a scale-up experiment for a whole well site to test the validity of MLTT along different pad removal techniques.

AB Thick deposits of peat derived from fen environments accumulated in the coastal lowland areas adjacent to the North Sea during the middle and late Holocene. These sediments are frequently used in pollen-based reconstructions of in situ and more distant vegetation. However, discriminating between wetland and dry land originating pollen signals, and between the potential fen communities present in the wetland, is complex. In this study, a suite of analytical approaches are used to explore the pollen signal of modern fen communities and compare them against Holocene pollen assemblages. At two sites in eastern England, Woodwalton Fen and Upton Broad, vegetation composition was recorded around a series of moss polster sampling points. The communities investigated included herbaceous fen communities under different cutting regimes, a grazed area, glades, and woodland with canopies dominated by Alnus glutinosa and Betula. Cluster analysis is used to provide an overview of, and compare the structure within, the datasets consisting of the vegetation, the vegetation converted to palynological equivalents, and the pollen data. It is demonstrated that any loss of taxonomic precision in pollen identifications does not pose particular problems when attempting to identify fen communities, including tall-herbaceous vegetation, in the pollen record. Indices of Association imply pollen presence can be interpreted as indicating the local presence for some taxa, though few of these are confined to a particular community. Herbaceous fen vegetation subject to different management regimes are, however, shown to produce distinctive pollen signatures. Middle and late Holocene pollen assemblages from eastern (Fenland) and southern (Romney Marsh) England, interpreted as derived from fen vegetation, are compared against the modern pollen dataset using ordination. Most of the fossil samples plot out within or adjacent to the groupings produced by the modern samples in the ordinations. While these investigations demonstrate that modern pollen work can help improve the interpretation of Holocene assemblages they also call attention to a number of limitations including the restricted range of communities from which modern samples are currently available and the potential for non-analogous modern vegetation. The paper concludes with ideas to aid the interpretation of pollen data collected from fen peats and suggestions for future work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon and peat accumulation rates over the past 1200 yr were measured in relation to permafrost aggradation, maturity, ground fires, and degradation in a peatland with discontinuous permafrost near Fort Simpson, N.W.T., Canada. The White River volcanic ash layer, deposited 1200 yr ago, was used as a chronostratigraphic marker to compare peat and carbon accumulation among peat cores collected along transects over a consistent period of time. The aggradation of permafrost results in a change from unfrozen bog to forested peat plateau, and approximate decreases of 50 and 65% in carbon and vertical peat accumulation rates, respectively. Carbon and peat accumulation continue to decrease significantly with both increasing permafrost maturity and the number of ground fires. The transition from peat plateau to collapse bog through internal permafrost degradation results in up to a 72 and 200% increase in carbon and vertical peat accumulation rates, respectively. Permafrost degradation at the margins of a peat plateau can result in the formation of collapse fens, in which vertical peat accumulation increases significantly yet the carbon accumulation rates remain similar to the peat plateau. A warming climate may result in a shift towards higher carbon accumulation rates in peatlands associated with bog vegetation following pear plateau collapse, yet warmer peat temperatures, greater soil aeration, greater rates of peat decomposition, and an increase in burning may provide limits to the increase.

AB Carbon cycling is central to nutrient dynamics and accretion rates in wetlands.  Drainage and conversion of wetlands has been occurring at an accelerating rate.  This paper compares decay rates in natural and disturbed peatlands in the southeastern USA and examines relationships between edaphic factors and decay rates.  Cellulose decay rates (as tensile strength loss of cotton fibers) were used to compare decomposition potentials in these peatlands.  A 1984 pilot experiment included undisturbed short pocosin and several sites under various stages of agricultural conversion.  A spring 1987 experiment included an increasing nutrient availability gradient in undisturbed communities from short pocosin to tall pocosin to gum swamp, drained pocosin with natural vegetation remaining, and pocosin converted to pine forestry and agriculture.  In the 1984 experiment, disturbed sites had decay rates approximately nine times greater than undisturbed pocosin.  In the 1987 experiment, disturbed sites had decay rates from 1.8 to 10.3 times natural sites.  The greatest decay rates occurred in the agricultural site with its high nutrients, less acidic conditions, and relatively low soil moisture.  Drained pocosin had the next highest decay rates, although pH and nutrients were low.  Pine (Pinus taeda L.) forestry had intermediate rates of decay, while undisturbed sites had low rates.  The more nutrient-rich, but wet and low pH, gum swamp site had similar or slightly higher rates than the pocosin sites.  Drainage, relieving excessive soil moisture and the resultant anaerobiosis, was the dominant factor explaining the greater decay rates in the disturbed sites.  Other factors, such as nutrient availability and low pH, may have had secondary effects on cellulose decay.  Rates were also compared to a global data set based on potential evapotranspiration.  Natural sites have rates very close to those predicted, while disturbed sites have much higher rates (1.9-4.4 x predicted).

AB Peat deposits from an ombrotrophic bog (north-eastern Poland) were analysed to reconstruct peatland development and environmental changes. This paper presents reconstructions of hydrological changes and plant succession over the last 6000years. The methods included the high-resolution analysis of plant macrofossils, pollen and testate amoebae, supported by radiocarbon dating. Three main phases were identified in the history of the bog and surrounding woodland vegetation: 4000-400 BC, 400 BC-AD 1700 and AD 1700-2011. Except for terrestrialisation and the fen-to-bog transition phase, the development of bog vegetation was mainly dependent on the climate until approximately AD 1700. The dominant taxon in Gzwa bog was Sphagnum fuscum/rubellum. Woodland development was significantly affected by human activity at several time periods. The most visible human activity, manifested by the decline of deciduous species, occurred ca. 350 BC, ca. AD 250, ca. AD 1350 and after AD 1700. These events correspond to phases of human settlement in the area. During 400-300 BC, the decline of deciduous trees, primarily Carpinus, coincided with an increase in indicators of human activity and fire frequency. At ca. AD 200, Carpinus and Tilia abundance decreased, corresponding to an increased importance of cereals (Secale and Triticum). Since ca. AD 1350, the impact of Teutonic settlement is apparent, and after AD 1700, deciduous forests largely disappeared.

AB Calla palustris is a circumboreal species native to wetland habitats of the Northern Hemisphere. Information about the complex distribution, vegetation and ecology of C. palustris in Slovakia is still missing and scattered in several local published sources and herbaria. Therefore, we decided to (i) characterise its distribution and ecological pattern, and (ii) provide a complex vegetation affiliation of the species in this territory. C. palustris has been reported from almost 30 localities concentrated in the northern part of Central Slovakia, especially in the Zapadne Beskydy Mts. The number of records rapidly decreases towards southern and eastern Slovakia. The species prefers nutrient-poor and acidic sites in regions with humid and relatively cold climates. A vegetation analysis of available phytosociological releves revealed the presence of C. palustris in the vegetation of mires (classes Scheuchzerio-Caricetea fuscae, Oxycocco-Sphagnetea, Vaccinio-Piceetea), alder carrs (Alnetea glutinosae class) and marshes (Phragmito-Magnocaricetea class). The major environmental gradients responsible for the variation in species composition of the vegetation were analysed in Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) using Ellenberg indicator values for vascular plants. The first DCA axis corresponded to the amount of nutrients, soil reaction and temperature. Based on our study, the inclusion of C. palustris among vulnerable species within the Slovak Plant Red List is considered correct.

ID ECOLOGY; MIRES; PEATLANDS; BASIN
AB The vegetation of a mire in a medium-high rainfall area of South Island, New Zealand is described. The central part of the bog is raised 6 m above the surroundings, suggesting that it is ombrotrophic, and the species present are those of apparently ombrotrophic bogs elsewhere in New Zealand. pH of < 4.0 and Ca/Mg molar quotient of < 1.0 also indicates ombrotrophic conditions. Within the mire, these criteria provide effective discrimination between the fen (rheotrophic) and bog (ombrotrophic) communities. A bimodal distribution of ordination scores suggests that the change in pH and in Ca/Mg quotients cause a switch to operate.

AB The decay of Sphagnum cuspidatum and S. fuscum was measured in an ombrotrophic (rain-fed) raised bog.  These species most commonly occupy the two major bog microhabitats, hollows and hummocks, respectively.  Plants of these two species, excluding their capitulum, were enclosed in nylon mesh decomposition bags and reciprocally transplanted into hummocks and hollows at several levels with respect to the water table for 10 and 22 months.  The reciprocal transplants enabled us to identify whether decay was species or microhabitat regulated.
   S. cuspidatum in the hollows decayed 1.5 times as fast as S. fuscum in the oxic part of the hummocks (16.9% vs 11.3% mass loss).  The reciprocal litter transplants showed that differences in decay between species completely overruled the effects of microhabitat.  Thus, S. cuspidatum decayed relatively fast in the hollows in spite of the wetness, whereas S. fuscum decayed slowly even in the hummocks where conditions are most favorable for decay.
   Decay rates for S. cuspidatum and S. fuscum were much lower during the second incubation interval (5.7% and 1.5% additional mass loss, respectively, in the oxic part of the hummock).  Even though decay slowed down greatly in the second interval, differences between species were still maintained through 22 months.  The differences in decay of these two species may initiate and maintain the hummock-hollow microtopography.

AB Rich fens are known for their high botanical diversity encompassing many endangered species. For decades, several management measures, including mowing and burning, have been applied to maintain a high biodiversity by means of slowing down the natural succession from calcareous rich fens to acidic poor fens or woodland. In this study, we assessed the long-term effects of these traditional management measures, and explored the effectiveness of liming as a measure to restore rich fen vegetation. Effects of summer mowing, and of burning after winter mowing, were assessed by comparing current (2013) and historical (1967) vegetation data. Effects of experimental liming, using different levels of lime addition (0, 1000, 2000, and 4000 kg Dolokal/ha), were monitored in the field during 7.5 years. Summer mowing led to more acidic and nutrient-poor conditions as indicated by a shift from rich to poor fen vegetation, including a well-developed bryophyte cover dominated by Sphagnum with some threatened species. Burning (after winter mowing) counteracted acidification but increased nutrient availability, as indicated by dominance of vascular species characteristic of productive tall-herb grasslands and a sparse bryophyte cover with common species. We conclude that the traditional measures were unable to maintain rich fen composition in the long term. Given the fact that the restoration of hydrological conditions, favouring rich fens, is not always feasible, liming could be an alternative to counteract acidification and improve rich fen conditions in the short term. This measure, however, appeared to be unsustainable as the re-establishment and dominance of Sphagnum spp. seriously complicated the development of rich fen vegetation in the longer term.

AB Mesotrophic rich fens, that is, groundwater-fed mires, may be long-lasting, as well as transient ecosystems, displaced in time by poor fens, bogs, forests or eutrophic reeds. We hypothesized that fen stability is controlled by plant stress caused by waterlogging with calcium-rich and nutrient-poor groundwater, which limits expansion of hummock mosses, tussock sedges and trees. We analysed 32 European Holocene macrofossil profiles of rich fens using plant functional traits (PFTs) which indicate the level of plant stress in the environment: canopy height, clonal spread, diaspore mass, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, Ellenberg moisture value, hummock-forming ability, mycorrhizal status and plant functional groups. Six PFTs, which formed long-term significant trends during mire development, were compiled as rich fen stress indicator (RFSI). We found that RFSI values at the start of fen development were correlated with the thickness of subsequently accumulated rich fen peat. RFSI declined in fens approaching change into another mire type, regardless whether it was shifting into bog, forest or eutrophic reeds. RFSI remained comparatively high and stable in three rich fens, which have not terminated naturally until present times. By applying PFT analysis to macrofossil data, we demonstrated that fens may undergo a gradual autogenic process, which lowers the ecosystem's resistance and enhances shifts to other mire types. Long-lasting rich fens, documented by deep peat deposits, are rare. Because autogenic processes tend to alleviate stress in fens, high levels of stress are needed at initial stages of rich fen development to enable its long persistence and continuous peat accumulation.

AB The vegetation of five Appalachian bogs (one site in Tennessee and four in West Virginia) was sampled using a point-quarter method. Rubus hispidus had the highest importance value in the Tennessee site and Vaccinium oxycoccus in the West Virginia sites. Major differences and similarities in vegetation are summarized, and comparisons are made with northern peat bogs, which are also dominated by dwarf shrubs. The dominant growth form in all the bop was recumbent shrub, which was two to three times more important than other growth forms. Within the growth form, the importance values of R. hispidus (Rosaceae) and the evergreen recumbents (Ericaceae) were inversely related. Among sites, the importance value of R. hispidus was positively associated with soil nutrient status (r2 = 0.99), while those of the ericaceous recumbents were negatively associated with nutrients (r2 = 0.94). This relationship was consistent for all macronutrients except nitrate. This relationship is important since eutrophication may exacerbate the decline of Appalachian bogs and indigenous vegetation. As bogs become more minerotrophic, we predict a shift in dominance from evergreen to deciduous species. Specifically, the importance of R. hispidus may increase as the importance of bog ericads decreases.

AB The impacts of increased N deposition (wet; NH4+ and dry; NH3) on ombrotrophic mire vegetation were compared in a two-year dose-response study. Vegetation from an ombrotrophic mire in SE Scotland was exposed in open-top chambers to a range of wet N deposition at 0 (deionised water), 8, 16, 32, 64 & 128 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) applied as NH4Cl and dry N deposition as gaseous NH3 at concentrations of 2, 6, 20, 50 90 mug m(-3). N concentrations in the foliage of all species showed a significant linear increase in response to dose when N was applied as wet deposited NH4+ in both 1999 and 2000. Comparison of the linear regression for foliar N versus NH4+ and NH3 in the dose-response relationships showed significant differences (p<0.05) between the form of N applied and %N concentration for two species in 1999 (C vulgaris and P. commune) but not in 2000. There was a significant increase in C vulgaris shoot growth in the NH3 treatments compared to NH4+ treatments when expressed per unit deposited N. Effects of nitrogen deposited as gaseous NH3 are generally greater than those of wet deposited NH4+ on moorland species, when expressed per unit deposited N.

AB Mires have been classified in northern Europe at two levels: (1) mire complexes are viewed as large landscape units with common features in hydrology, pear stratigraphy and general arrangement of surface patterns and of minerogenous vs. ombrogenous site conditions; (2) mire sites are considered as units of vegetation research and used in surveys for forestry and conservation. This paper reviews the development of site type classifications in Fennoscandia (Finland, Sweden, Norway), with a discussion on circumboreal classification and corresponding mire vegetation types in Canada. The scale of observation affects classifications: small plot size (0.25-1 m(2)) has been used in Scandinavia to make detailed analyses of ecological and microtopographical variation in mostly treeless mire ecosystems, while larger sampling areas (up to 100-400 m(2)) have been commonly employed in Finnish studies of forested peatlands. Besides conventional hierarchic classifications, boreal mires have been viewed as an open, multidimensional, non-hierarchic system which can be described and classified with factor, principal component or correspondence analyses. Fuzzy clustering is suggested as an alternative method of classification in mire studies where only selected environmental and vegetational parameters are measured or estimated.

AB Fluxes of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC) and methane were measured above a boreal fen. Vegetation on the fen is dominated by Sphagnum mosses and sedges. A relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system with dynamic deadband was designed and constructed for the measurements. Methane, C-2-C-6 hydrocarbons and some halogenated hydrocarbons were analysed from the samples by gas chromatographs equipped with FID and ECD. A significant flux of isoprene and methane was detected during the growing seasons. Isoprene emission was found to follow the common isoprene emission algorithm. Average standard emission potential of isoprene was 680 mu g m(-2) h(-1). Fluxes of other non-methane hydrocarbons were below detection limit.

AB This study examines the relationships between allogenic and autogenic processes during the Holocene development of a southern Quebec bog. Local vegetation, surface moisture and peat accumulation were independently reconstructed from palaeoecological data (microfossils, macrofossils, loss-on-ignition and radiocarbon dating) and sedimentological analyses conducted on seven profiles. The observed successional stages, from pond to marsh, rich fen, poor fen then bog, represents a typical hydrosere. The early wetland development provides an obvious illustration of the facilitation model: each community modified the hydrological conditions by means of peat accumulation which then favoured the onset of the succeeding stage. No direct link is evidenced between vegetation, moisture and peat accumulation, while all of them clearly reveal the initial influence of minerotrophic groundwater supply. Notably, the decrease in this allogenic influence is reflected by the increasing asynchrony of local vegetation change. The comparison of the seven profiles also shows several asynchronous moisture fluctuations at the peatland scale but none seems to be related to climate. In contrast, net peat accumulation shows similar trends in all marginal profiles and at the peatland scale. As a consequence of the initial minerotrophic supply, peat-accumulation rates were high during the early Holocene and low during the mid- and late Holocene. Our results, which show the major influence of groundwater and autogenic processes on peat accumulation, strongly contrast with the general climatic control recognized for European peatlands.

AB Questions: What are the long-term results of fen meadow restoration after topsoil removal on peatlands? What are the causes of slow fen-meadow vegetation recovery on peat soils after topsoil removal?
   Location: Drentsche Aa Nature Reserve (53 degrees 0049N, 6 degrees 3746E) in the northeast Netherlands, with extensive natural and partially restored fen meadows (ca. 10,000ha).
   Methods: Restoration measures consisted of removal of acidified and fertilized topsoil and improvement of local hydrology by blocking or removing drainage ditches. The effects of shallow (20cm) and deep (40cm) topsoil removal were compared. We monitored vegetation changes after restoration measures in permanent plots over a 13-yr period, and analysed changes in species composition over time with ordination techniques (multivariate analysis: PCA and RDA). Soil conditions over time were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA.
   Results: The vegetation and environment shifted over time in response to restoration. At first the vegetation stagnated in a species-poor phase for 5yr, but eventually fen-meadow species re-established. At the end of the observation period, after 14yr, the vegetation after both shallow and deep peat removal was similar. Soil acidification occurred immediately after topsoil removal (within the first 2-3yr) due to pyrite oxidation when the soil was exposed to air after site excavation and the peat was temporarily desiccated.
   Conclusions: We found poor re-establishment of fen-meadow vegetation and persistence of species-poor communities during the first 5yr after topsoil removal, probably resulting from internal soil acidification. After further rewetting, a rapid shift towards the target community composition was observed. The positive shift in development of fen-meadow vegetation probably occurred due to increased groundwater discharge after successful hydrological measures were applied. Appropriate hydrological conditions (strong discharge of groundwater) are important for the success of restoration of these fen meadows, especially if pyrite is present in shallow soil layers.

AB Question: How does restoration affect the hydrology and the understorey vegetation of managed pine fens?
   Location: Oligotrophic pine fens in Natura 2000 areas in Kainuu, eastern Finland.
   Methods: Eleven managed pine fens and eight pristine reference pine fens were chosen for the study in 2005. The managed fens, which had been drained for forestry during the 1970s and 1980s, were restored in 2007. The water table was monitored in all fens over four growing seasons during 2006 to 2009, and vegetation was surveyed from permanent sample plots in 2006 and 2009.
   Results: Before restoration in 2006, the water table was at a significantly lower level in the managed fens compared with the pristine fens. Immediately after restoration, the water table rose to the same level as in the pristine fens, and this change was permanent. Forest drainage had had little impact on the understorey vegetation of the managed fens in the three decades before restoration, with species typical of pristine fens still dominating the sites. Forest dwarf shrubs and feather mosses had started to increase in cover, but mire dwarf shrubs and Sphagnum mosses still dominated the managed fens. Only the typical hollow species Sphagnum majus, Sphagnum balticum and Scheuzeria palustris were missing from the managed fens. Two years after restoration, the changes in species composition were also marginal, with increased cover of mire dwarf shrubs and sedges being the only significant change.
   Conclusions: The success of restoration of oligotrophic pine fens seems likely, given that changes in hydrological functioning occurred rapidly, and since little change has occurred in the vegetation composition after draining. Speeding up the regeneration process in these peatland types by restoration may, therefore, be recommended, especially if the drainage effect extends to nearby pristine mires and influences their biodiversity.

AB The response of plant growth to rising CO2 levels appears to depend on nutrient availability, but it is not known whether the growth of bog plants reacts similarly. We therefore studied the effects of elevated CO2 in combination with N supply on the growth of Sphagnum mosses and vascular plants in ombrotrophic bog vegetation. Because the growth of Sphagnum is less nutrient-limited than that of vascular plants, we hypothesized that Sphagnum would benefit from elevated CO2. In our greenhouse experiment, peat monoliths (34 cm diameter, 40 cm deep) with intact bog vegetation were exposed to ambient (350 ppmv) or elevated (560 ppmv) atmospheric CO2 combined with low (no N addition) or high (5 g N m(-2) yr(-1) added) N deposition for two growing seasons. Elevated atmospheric CO2 had unexpected deleterious effects on the growth of Sphagnum magellanicum, the dominant Sphagnum species. Growth was greatly reduced, particularly in the second growing season when, regardless of N supply, the mosses looked unhealthy. The negative CO2 effect was strongest in the warmest months, suggesting a combined effect of elevated CO2 and the raised temperatures in the greenhouse. High N deposition favored Rhynchospora alba, which became the dominant vascular plant species during the experiment. Biomass increased more when N supply was high. There were no significant effects of elevated CO2 on vascular plants, although elevated CO2 combined with high N supply tended to increase the aboveground vascular plant biomass. As Sphagnum is the main carbon-sequestrating species in bogs and rising atmospheric CO2 levels are likely to be followed by increases in temperature, there is an urgent need for further research on the combined effects of elevated CO2 and increased temperature on Sphagnum growth in bog ecosystems.

AB Questions Peatland ecosystems are a globally important carbon storage that is predicted to turn into a carbon source due to water level drawdown (WLD) associated with climate change. The predictions assume stable plant communities but how realistic is this assumption? If the vegetation is not stable, what are the nature and rate of changes? Location Peatland complex in Southern Finland. Methods We conducted a water level drawdown (WLD of 10 cm) experiment over 17 years in three peatland types differing in their fertility. On each peatland type, we included an adjacent forestry drained (FD, with water table ca. 40 cm lower than in control) area for comparison. Results Peatland type had a clear impact on the response to WLD: at the ecosystem level, the two minerotrophic fens underwent rapid species turnover, while the vegetation in nutrient-poor bog was more resilient to change. In nutrient-rich sites, WLD initiated tree canopy development and created understorey conditions that strengthened impact of WLD. In nutrient-poor site, tree establishment was seen only in the FD area. In addition to high nutrient level, high wetness accelerated change at the plant community level, where we found three types of responses: accelerating change, decelerating change, and stability. Succession resulted in an overall loss of community heterogeneity. Conclusions Interaction between hydrology, nutrient availability, and biological factors in boreal peatlands is important: the drop in water table required to achieve the shift from open peatland to forested system is inversely proportional to the nutrient level of the system. The results suggest that predictive models of peatland functions under climate change should consider compositional change for fens and their diverse plant communities but are more realistic for bogs. The response of bog vegetation to climate change may, however, be more dependent on changes in rainfall regime and therefore needs to be further addressed.

AB In this study we analyse observations of water vapour and carbon dioxide fluxes over bog vegetation in the Netherlands. The observations are used to evaluate an assimilation photosynthesis (so-called A-g(s)) model on the canopy scale. Next, a simple estimate for the soil respiration has been added to the A-g(s) model. Leaf sample analysis showed that nitrogen concentration was well below optimum conditions, so the A-g(s) model was adjusted appropriately. Transpiration calculations with the adjusted model result in an excellent agreement with the measurements over the bog area. The total simulated fluxes of plant assimilation and soil respiration have been compared with the measured total CO2 flux. The agreement between simulations and experiments appears to be reasonably good. For practical applications a simplified relationship has been derived between the transpiration and the net assimilation rates. This relation has been tested and appears to work well for practical purposes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) in permafrost terrain is vulnerable to climate change. Perennially frozen peat deposits store large amounts of SOC, but we know little about its chemical composition and lability. We used plant macrofossil and biomarker analyses to reconstruct the Holocene paleovegetation and paleoenvironmental changes in two peat plateau profiles from the European Russian Arctic. Peat plateaus are the main stores of permafrost soil C in the region, but during most of the Holocene peats developed as permafrost-free rich fens with woody vegetation, sedges and mosses. Around 2200 cal BP, permafrost aggraded at the site resulting in frost heave and a drastic reduction in peat accumulation under the drier uplifted surface conditions. The permafrost dynamics (aggradation, frost-heave and thaw) ushered changes in plant assemblages and carbon accumulation, and consequently in the biomarker trends too.
   Detailed biomarker analyses indicate abundant neutral lipids, which follow the general pattern: n-alkanols > sterols >= n-alkanes >= triterpenols. The lignin monomers are not as abundant as the lipids and increase with depth. The selected aliphatic and phenolic compounds are source specific, and they have different degrees of lability, which is useful for tracing the impact of permafrost dynamics (peat accumulation and/or decay associated with thawing). However, common interpretation of biomarker patterns, and perceived hydrological and climate changes, must be applied carefully in permafrost regions. The increased proportion (selective preservation) of n-alkanes and lignin is a robust indicator of cumulative decomposition trajectories, which is mirrored by functional compounds (e. g. n-alkanol, triterpenol, and sterol concentrations) showing opposite trends. The distribution of these compounds follows first order decay kinetics, and concurs with the down core diagenetic changes. In particular, some of the biomarker ratios (e. g. stanol/sterol and higher plant alkane index) seem promising for tracing SOC decomposition despite changes in botanical imprint, and sites spanning across different soil types and locations. Carbon accumulation rate calculated at these sites varies from 18.1 to 31.1 gC m(-2) yr(-1), and it's evident selective preservation, molecular complexity of organic compounds, and freezing conditions enhance the long-term stability of SOC. Further, our results suggest that permafrost dynamics strongly impact the more undecomposed SOC that could be rapidly remobilized through ongoing thermokarst expansion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

AB Low-frequency mowing has been proposed to be an effective strategy for the restoration and management of boreal fens after abandonment of traditional haymaking. This study investigates how mowing affects long-term vegetation change in both oceanic and continental boreal rich-fen vegetation. This will allow evaluation of the effectiveness of mowing as a management and restoration tool in this ecosystem in the face of climate change. At two nature reserves in Central Norway (Tagdalen, 63 degrees 03' N, 9 degrees 05 E, oceanic climate and Solendet, 62 degrees 40' N, 11 degrees 50' E, continental climate), we used permanent plot data from the two sites to compare plant species composition from the late 1960s to the early 1980s with that recorded in 2012-2015 in abandoned and mown fens. Changes in species composition and frequency were analysed by multivariate and univariate methods in relation to environmental variables and modelled climate and groundwater data. Mowing resulted in a decline in shrub and Molinia caerulea cover at the continental and oceanic sites respectively, and the total cover of specialist fen species had increased to a significantly greater extent in the mown plots than the unmown at the continental site. However, mowing did not have an effect on the cover of specialist bryophyte species, and some specialist species declined regardless of mowing treatment. Temperature sums had increased at both sites, but precipitation had not changed significantly. Mowing was shown to be the most important determinant of plant community composition at both sites, with local environmental conditions being of secondary importance. In conclusion, the abandonment of traditional management practices results in the loss of characteristic fen species. In order to encourage the restoration of typical rich-fen vegetation, particularly in oceanic areas, additional management measures, such as more intensive mowing, may be required.

AB Small headwater fens at high elevations exist in the dry climatic regime of western Colorado, despite increasing demands for water development since the 1800's. Fens on Grand Mesa have accumulated plant material as peat for thousands of years due to cold temperatures and consistently saturated soils. The peatlands maintain unique plant communities, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and carbon storage. We located and differentiated 88 fens from 15 wet meadows and 2 marshes on Grand Mesa. Field work included determining vegetation, soils, moisture regimes, and impacts from human activities. All fens were groundwater-supported systems that occurred in depressions and slopes within sedimentary landslide and volcanic glacial till landscapes. Fens occupied 400 ha or less than 1 % of the 46,845 ha research area and ranged in size from 1 to 46 ha. Peat water pH in undisturbed sites ranged from 4.3 to 7.1. Most fens had plant communities dominated by sedges (Carex) with an understory of brown mosses. Variation in vegetation was controlled by stand wetness, water table level, organic C, conductivity (EC), and temperature A degrees C. Fen soils ranged from 13.6 to 44.1 % organic C with a mean of 30.3 %. Species diversity in fens was restricted by cold short growing seasons, stressful anaerobic conditions, and disturbance. Multivariate analysis was used to analyze relationships between vegetation, environmental, and impact variables. Stand wetness, water table level, OC, electrical conductivity (EC), and temperature were used to analyze vegetation variance in undisturbed fens, wet meadows, and marshes. Vegetation composition in impacted fens was influenced by flooding, sedimentation, stand wetness, water table level, OC, EC, and temperature. Hydrologically modified fens supported 58 plant species compared to 101 species in undisturbed fens. Analysis of historical 1936-2007 aerial photographs and condition scalars helped quantify impacts of human activities in fens as well as vegetation changes. Fourteen fens had evidence of peat subsidence, from organic soil collapse, blocks of peat in the margins, soil instability, and differences in surface peat height between the fen soil surface and the annually flooded soil surface. Of 374 ha of fens in the Grand Mesa study area, 294 ha (79 %) have been impacted by human activities such as ditching, drainage, flooding, or vehicular rutting. Many fens had little restoration potential due to severe hydrological and peat mass impacts, water rights, or the cost of restoration.

AB 1. Components of the CO2 balance for a drained minerotrophic fen and a drained ombrotrophic bog were measured for permanent plots using static chamber techniques for 1 year before and 2 years after a rewetting treatment in part of both sites. During the same period, changes in ground and bottom layer vegetation composition were monitored.
   2. After the treatment, the water table rose, the average increase being 25 cm for the fen site and 20 cm for the bog site. In the untreated areas the average water table remained at the pretreatment level.
   3. There was a clear change in vegetation composition in the rewetted area of the fen site where the cover of cottongrass Eriophorum vaginatum L. increased drastically. The change in vegetation composition seemed to be dependent on the nutrient status of the sites, being faster at the more nutrient-rich fen site.
   4. The rates of CO2 efflux from the soil surface decreased on those rewetted plots where all vegetation had been removed. In 1996, the CO2 efflux rates from the soil surface of the untreated plots were about twice as high as from the rewetted plots with a high water table.
   5. The change in water table levels and vegetation composition affected the seasonal (mid-May to end of September) CO2-C balances. For the rewetted area of the fen site, the CO2-C balance varied from 162 to 283 g m(-2), being greatest in a plot with dense E. vaginatum cover and a high water table. For the rewetted area of the bog site, the CO2-C balance varied from 54 to 101 g m(-2), being greatest in a hollow-level plot with a high water table and mire vegetation. For the untreated areas, the CO2-C balance was close to zero (3 g m(-2) at the bog site) or negative (-183 g m(-2) at the fen site), when carbon fixation by the tree stand was omitted.
   6. The results are encouraging from the practical point of view as restoration of both fen and bog sites initiated vegetation succession and CO2-C balance development towards those of pristine mires.

AB We compared the seasonal patterns of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations, pH, and electrical conductivity in pore water in a nutrient-poor mire of the southern Alps to precipitation chemistry, water-table depth, and potential evapotranspiration, with the main objective to unravel differences between pore-water chemistry in hummock and hollow habitats. Sodium concentrations in mire water were primarily determined by precipitation inputs, with highest values in spring. Potassium concentrations were dependent on vegetation uptake, peaking before the growing season started, and showing lowest values in summer. Calcium and magnesium concentrations were highest in summer. Cation-exchange processes, evaporation, and humification affected the periodicity of bivalent cations. The pH decreased from spring to autumn, gradually in hollow water and more abruptely in hummock water. Electrical conductivity followed the bivalent cation concentration pattern both in hummocks and hollows.

AB Alnus glutinosa-dominated peatlands are widespread in central Europe, but the generally bad preservation of micro- and macrofossils has hampered palaeoecological research of their peats. Because of its large carbon sequestration rate, however, peat accumulation in forested peatlands is of special interest for climate change research. This study identifies indicator groups for various types of alder (A. glutinosa) carr and sedge (Carex) fen vegetation, elaborated by analysis of non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) from peat and surface samples. The indicator value of fungal spores and decomposition products of wood was tested by correlation with pollen (especially ALNUS) and macrofossils. Only few indicators of alder carr also occurred with low and constant values during distinct open sedge fen phases, which indicates that small and plane shaped NPPs can be dispersed extra-locally. The diversity and abundance of NPPs appeared to depend on vegetation type and resulting nutrient supply and to water regime and resulting decomposition intensity during peat development.

AB Groundwater-fed wet meadows and rich fens with low, open vegetation form the core habitats of rare Bog Turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) in the northern part of their range in North America. Under current conditions, these habitats tend to become overgrown with taller vegetation in the absence of management. In agricultural and post-agricultural landscapes, managers sometimes use livestock grazing to improve and maintain habitat quality for Bog Turtles, despite insufficient knowledge about how specific practices affect both Bog Turtles and nontarget species. To further our understanding of such effects, we present results from a single wetland complex in New York, USA, which we managed primarily with cattle grazing over four and a half growing seasons. Management effectiveness was assessed by monitoring Bog Turtle nest placement, habitat use via radio tracking, and vegetation structure and composition change in permanent plots. Nest locations varied among years, with all nests placed in grazed or recently grazed areas. Individual turtles maintained, and in some cases expanded, their ranges in grazed areas during spring and summer, although they continued to avoid one (grazed) area with apparently unsuitable soils, and increasingly used cattle exclusion areas for fall and overwintering habitat. Plant species richness and the cover of native plants and fen-indicator plants increased in grazed areas, while cover of nonnative species did not. Grazing appeared to improve Bog Turtle habitat without negatively affecting fen and other wetland vegetation at this site, and we propose several specific management recommendations based on our results.

AB Two fen peat soils, supporting a species-rich fen vegetation with a high nature value, and two accompanying drained fen peat soils, supporting vegetation types with a low nature value, were subjected to a study on nutrient deficiency. This study tested what effect rewetting of drained fen peat soils had on the nutrient deficiency. In each of the study areas, soil was collected from the wet site and from a neighbouring drained site. Holcus lanatus was used as a phytometer screening the wet soil under wet conditions and the drained soil when drained or rewetted. The soil taken from the wet site revealed a higher yield than the soil from the drained site in both study areas. Additional supply of K, in combination with N or P supply, further increased the biomass yield. K-deficiency was even stronger in the drained site of both study areas. Experimental rewetting did not entirely remove this deficiency and additionally enhanced N-deficiency. The results from this phytometer approach are discussed as related to results from field and laboratory experiments with vegetation as object of research.

AB The efficacy of using vegetative clumps derived from seeds with a variety of origins to establish nuclei for regeneration of bog vegetation on abandoned peat mines in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick (Canada) was tested using seeds within scats (excrement) and seeds from berries, various techniques for creating clumps, and different clump sizes. Direct placement of scat pieces on peat in the field did not produce successful colonisation. Vegetative clumps begun in a greenhouse, whether from seeds extracted from scats or berries, were 60-100 % successful when transplanted into abandoned peat mines depending on the initial size of the transplant. Based on annual growth rate, Vaccinium oxycoccos has the greatest capacity to quickly colonise abandoned peat mines. Other promising taxa were Vaccinium vitis-ideae and the genus Empetrum.

   chemistry
AB The vegetation and ecology of the high Andean mires from northern Chile between 18 and 22 degrees southern latitude are described. They are dominated by the cushionplant species Distichia muscoides, D. filamentosa, Oxychloe andina (Juncaceae) and Scirpus s.l. (Cyperaceae). Especially Distichia muscoides but also most of its herbaceous accompanying flora have tropical Andean distribution areas, which reach their southwestern limits in northern Chile.
   From a comparison with the Andean mire vegetation from Peru, Bolivia and northwestern Argentina follows clearly that the dominating plant communities of the high Andean mires of northern Chile can be included in the fitosociological class of the Plantagini rigidae-Distichietea muscoidis Rivas Martinez et Tovar 1982. It is suggested to adjoin the Oxychloetum andinae to an own alliance, the Oxychloion andinae all. nov., because its geographical range reaches much farther south in the Chilean and Argentine Andes, where the accompanying tropical Andean flora is completely missing.
   The occurrence of Distichia muscoides in contrast to that of Oxychloe andina is linked to mire sites infiltrated by seepage waters from springs and, rivulets poor in mineral constituents, which neither tend to accumulate salts on top during dry periods. Oxychloce andina has thereto a much wider ecological range.
   The influence of pasturing wild and domestic animals upon the vegetation of the Andean mires is very great and favours the extension of the cushion-plant species on account of the more damaged grasses and rushes. Observations on the vegetative and generative propagation ecology as well as a general geographical comparison of the high Andean flora of the mire sites confirms the impression, that there cannot exist any effective distribution barriers for these species and that their actual occurrence reveals their ecological demands and limitations.

AB This paper describes the present-day vegetation, stratigraphy and developmental history of the mire of Egelsee-Moor (Salzburg, Austria; 45A degrees 45'N, 13A degrees 8.5'E, 700 m a.s.l., 15 ha in area) since the early Late Glacial on the basis of 4 transects with 14 trial borings across the peatland. We present a vegetation map of the mire, a longitudinal section through the peat body based on six cores showing the peat types, overview macrofossil diagrams of six cores showing the local mire development and two pollen diagrams covering the Late Glacial and Holocene. The chronology of the diagrams depends on biostratigraphic dating for the Late Glacial and early Holocene and radiocarbon dating for the remaining Holocene. The northern part of the mire originated through terrestrialisation of nutrient-rich, mostly inundated fen and the southern part through paludification of wet soils. The very small lake of today was a reservoir until recently for providing water-power for timber rafting ('Holztrift'). The mire vegetation today is a complex of forested parts (mainly planted Pinus sylvestris and Thuja occidentalis, but also spontaneous Picea abies, Betula pubescens and Frangula alnus), reed-lands (Phragmites) and litter meadows (Molinietum, Schoenetum, etc.). The central part has hummock-hollow complexes with regionally rare species of transitional mires (Drosera anglica, D. intermedia, Lycopodiella inundata, Scorpidium scorpioides, Sphagnum platyphyllum, S. subnitens). The results indicate that some of the mid-Holocene sediments may have been removed by the timber-rafting practices, and that water extraction from the hydrological catchment since 1967 has resulted in a partial shift of transitional mire to ombrotrophic bog. The latter potentially endangers the regionally rare species and was used as an argument to stop further water extraction.

AB Testate lobose amoebae of the order Arcellinida are a diverse, cosmopolitan group of shelled protists found in many environments, including freshwater habitats, peatlands, and soils. Their decay-resistant tests make them an important fossil group for reconstructing Quaternary environments. Within the family Difflugidae Stein, 1859 more than 300 species and 200 sub-species have been attributed to the genus Difflugia Leclerc, 1815. Although carried out on only a few taxa, molecular evidence has demonstrated that test morphology is more important than test composition in categorizing distinct taxa within the Arcellinida. The type species of Difflugia, D. proteiformis Lamarck, 1816, is characterized by a terminal aperture and an elongate acuminate test. The morphology of D. proteiformis is vastly different from most species assigned to Difflugia, explaining its polyphyletic status. We reclassify Difflugia bidens Penard, 1902 as type species of Erugomicula, a new genus within the Difflugidae, which is distinguished from other taxa within Difflugia by its broad, ovoid test, and distinct compression. Based on the compressed morphology of the test, which is not a characteristic of the Difflugiidae, we tentatively assign Erugomicula to the family Hyalospheniidae.

AB For seven years we studied the recovery of vegetation in a Belgian P limited rich fen (Caricion davallianae), which had been fertilized with nitrogen (200 g.m(-2)) and phosphorus (50 g.m(-2)) in 1992. The vegetation in this fen has low above-ground biomass production (< 100 g m(-2)) due to the strong P limitation. Above-ground biomass was harvested from 1992 to 1998 and P and N concentrations measured. In 1998, below-ground biomass was also harvested. The response to fertilization differed markedly between below- and above-ground compartments. Above-ground, P was the single most important factor that continued to stimulate growth 7 yr after fertilization. Below-ground, N tended to decrease live root biomass and increase dead root biomass and seemed to have a toxic effect on the roots. In the combined NP treatment the stimulating effect of P (an increase of live root biomass) was countered by N. The 1998 soil analysis showed no difference in soil P in the plots. Thus, Fe hydroxides are not capable of retaining P in competition with fen vegetation uptake. However, higher capture of P in root Fe coatings from N plots may partially explain this negative N effect. The results suggest that N root toxicity will be amplified in strongly P limited habitats but that its persistence will be less influenced by P availability. This mechanism may be a competitive advantage for N-2 fixing species that grow in strongly P limited wetlands.

SO JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE

DT Article
DE ACIDIFICATION; ALKALINITY; CARICION-DAVALLIANAE; RICH FEN
AB The soil chemistry of a headwater valley fen is influenced by local ground water discharge that supplies base cations and alkalinity to the fen.  An irrigation canal just upward of the fen is the source of this alkalinity.  The ecological consequences of this artificial system are studied both on the soil and vegetation level.  Rich-fen species of the alliance Caricion davallianae are connected to soil water alkalinity and soil base status.  They depend directly on the alkaline ground water discharge.  In addition, the local input of this water causes a gradient-rich pattern from poor to rich fen, and it is therefore concluded that it is responsible for the presence of intermediate fen vegetation too.  High nutrient levels in the irrigation water have not influenced the fen until now.  This case study illustrates the possibility for rich fen restoration after acidification.  Irrigation with alkaline water is efficient if excess nutrients can be removed.

AB Peatlands have been important terrestrial carbon (C) reservoirs throughout the Holocene, yet whether these ecosystems will become stronger or weaker C sinks in the future remains debated. While surface peat layers (acrotelm) have a greater apparent rate of C accumulation than deeper, millennial-aged peat (catotelm), it is difficult to project how much more aerobic decomposition will take place before the younger surface cohorts join the older deeper ones. Studies have suggested that warming could lead to weakened C accumulation in peatlands due to enhanced aerobic decay in the acrotelm, which would lead to a slower transfer of peat into the catotelm, if any. Conversely, other studies have suggested increased C accumulation in the acrotelm and thus, larger long-term C transfer into the catotelm under warming conditions because of greater plant productivity and faster peat accumulation. Improving our predictions about the rate of present and future peatland development is important to forecast feedbacks on the global C cycle and help inform land management decisions. In this study, we analyzed two peat cores from southern Patagonia to calculate their long- versus short-peat C accumulation rates. The acrotelm rates were compared to the catotelm peat C legacies using an empirical modeling approach that allows calculating the future catotelm peat storage based on today's acrotelm characteristics, and thus predict if those recent rates of C accumulation will lead to greater or weaker long-term C storage in the future. Our results indicate that, depending on local bioclimatic parameters, some peatlands may become stronger C sinks in the future, while others may become weaker. In the case of this study, the wetter site is expected to increase its C sink capacity, while our prediction for the drier site is a net decrease in C sequestration in the coming decades to centuries.

AB Decomposition rates of peat and cellulose, and oxygen consumption rates were studied in three minerotrophic peat mires in Sasakami, central Japan. These mires had differences in topography, pedology and hydrology. Two dominant vegetation types in each mire, a Sphagnum palustre-S. cuspidatum community and a Rhynchospora fauriei community, were selected as the decomposition study sites. The objective of this study was to examine how the environmental and vegetational differences in mires correlate with the activity of decomposition. Decomposition rates of peat and the rates of cellulolysis were studied in the field for 6 months. Oxygen consumption rates were measured in the field using a closed chamber equipped with an oxygen electrode. In situ peat decomposition rates showed significant differences among the three mires, whereas in situ cellulolysis rates showed significant differences between communities. Peat mass loss rates positively correlated with the nitrogen and carbon concentration of the peat. Cellulolysis rates positively correlated with the range of water table fluctuation. Oxygen consumption rates showed significant negative correlation with the averaged and minimum water table depth, and positive correlation with the range of water table fluctuation. There was a significant positive correlation between cellulolysis rates and oxygen consumption rates. These are useful parameters for evaluating how the decomposition activity in soil depends on the vegetation types and water conditions. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Climate is a major factor affecting the development and form of peatlands, as well as the distribution of individual bryophyte species. This paper examines the climatic and ecological gradients affecting the distribution of peatland types along a north-south gradient in the Mackenzie River Basin. Based on a TWINSPAN analysis of bryophyte abundance from 82 peatlands in the Mackenzie River Basin, seven peatland types, two with southerly geographical distributions are recognized. In the Mackenzie River Basin, such local factors as surface water chemistry, pH, and solute concentration as well as height above the water table play a significant role in determining bryophyte species distributions. Climate is secondary. Amongst the climatic variables, precipitation, length of the growing season, and annual temperature are the most significant. The seven peatland groups are: widespread poor fens; peat plateaus with thermokarst pools, low-Boreal bogs; bogs and peat plateaus without thermokarst pools; low-Boreal dry poor fens; wet moderate-rich fens; and wet extreme-rich fens.

AB Question: Which restoration measures (reintroduction techniques. reintroduction timing and fertilization) best enable the establishment of fen species oil North American cut-away peatland?
   Location: Riviere-du-Loup peatland, southern Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: In total, eight treatments which tested a combination of two reintroduction techniques, two reintroduction timings and the use of phosphorus fertilization were tested in a field experiment within a completely randomized block design.
   Results: Sphagnum transfer, a reintroduction technique commonly used for bog restoration in North America, was effective for establishing Sphagnum and Carex species. The hay transfer method. commonly Used for fell restoration in Europe. was much less Successful, probably due to questionable viability of reintroduced seeds. The treatments Which included light phosphorus fertilization. had a higher Carex cover after three growing seasons. The timing of the of the reintroductions had no impact on the success of vegetation establishment. However. vegetation reintroduction should be carried out in the spring while the ground is still frozen to minimize other ecological impacts.
   Conclusions: The success of the diaspore reintroduction technique on small-scale units indicates that a large-scale restoration of fells using this technique is feasible.

TI Application of Shumann and Joosten classification in fen peatland
   degradation stage assessment - A case study from southern Poland
SO ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The aim of this paper was to assess the degradation stage of fen peatland located in the north-western part of the Opolskie voivodeship in accordance with "peatland degradation stages" classification. Understanding of the current state of peatland will be helpful in the future management and possible restoration. Field survey including vegetation and soil research were carried out in May 2013, soil material for laboratory analysis were collected by using "Instorf" peat sampler from four sampling points. Obtained results allowed to classify the study area (located within a larger peatland complex along the Prosna river valley) to minor stage of degradation, with spontaneous changes in vegetation community and soil cover. Only few species of plants typical for fen peatlands were recorded. Moreover, soil cover research did not confirm mursh forming process, typical for strongly degraded peatland areas. Obtained results may indicate that possible future restoration will bring the expected effect. It is very likely, that fen peatland vegetation will regenerate spontaneously, provided that diaspores of the key peat-forming plant species are available in the soil.

DE BOG AREA; FINLAND; MIRE TYPE STATISTICS; SOUTHERN AAPA MIRE AREA
AB The percentage distribution of virgin and drained mire types was studied over the period 1984-1986.  Fifty-five large sample areas (10 x 10 km2) were taken at random, and five small plots (1 km2) were studied in each.  The line transect method was used, the total mire transect length being 1 543 km.  The survey covers 60 site types.  The material is treated both as a whole and divided into bog and aapa mire areas.  Twenty-six per cent of the peatlands are nowadays in natural condition.  Twenty-six mire types are more or less rare or endangered.  Draining has accentuated the contrasts in virgin vegetation between the bog and aapa mire areas.  The virgin peatlands of the bog area are nowadays more forested, drier and more ombro-oligotrophic than 30 years ago, while those of the aapa mire area are wetter, more open and mesotrophic.  Draining has been chiefly concentrated in the forested mire types (spruce mires, pine mires/bogs, birch fens, pine fens).  Many mire types are unprofitable for forestry purposes.  Their proportion of the drained peatlands is 17%.  The drainage percentage for these unsuitable types averages over 50%.

AB (1) In pot experiments on a wet-heath peat from east Devon, Cirsium dissectum showed a strong positive response to lime but not to CaCl2, and to added P but not to N. Carex echinata responded strongly to lime, N and P. Neither species responded significantly to added K.
   (2) Peat samples were analysed from six sites in Devon: two lowland wet heaths (Ericion tetralicis), an upland blanket bog (Calluno-Sphagnion papillosi/Oxycocco-Ericion), and three upland poor-fens (Caricion nigrae).
   (3) Extractable amounts of the major cations were similar at the six sites, with somewhat higher levels of K in the wet heaths, Mg and Na in the blanket bog, and Ca in the poor-fens. The wet-heath sites were lowest in extractable NH4-N and P; the highest NH4-N values were in the poor-fens.
   (4) Total P was highest in the poor-fens; total Mn and Al were lowest in the blanket peat. C-N and C-P ratios were highest in the wet heath and blanket bog, and lowest in the poor-fens.
   (5) Plant analyses suggested greater availability of Fe and Mn in the wet heath and poor-fen sites, but otherwise did not closely reflect the peat analyses.
   (6) A factorial nutrient-addition experiment with Carex echinata grown on peats from the six sites showed that N and P were limiting growth on all six. N was more strongly limiting on the wet heath peats and P on the blanket bog. Both N and P appeared more freely available in the poor-fen peats.
   (7) K appeared to be in at least adequate supply in all but the blanket-bog peat; it showed no significant main-effect response, but there were significant interactions with N, P and Site. These suggest differences in processes of N supply and uptake in the wet heaths and blanket bog on the one hand, and the poor-fens on the other.

The initial values of the Cs-137 concentration ratios CR(t) and transfer factors TF(t), in the aboveground phytomass of natural meadow grass vegetation in peat-bog soils in the real soil-climatic conditions of Western Polissya were determined. Based on the results of the field and laboratory studies, the values of fast and slow periods of the ecological half-reduction (T-e(f) and T-e(s) , respectively) of CR and TF of radioactive cesium in the studied soils were estimated. The model for prediction of the dynamics of CR and TF of radioactive cesium into natural meadow grass vegetation from peat-bog soils with its abnormal high biological availability was proposed.

AB Research carried out at the 'Czarne Bagno' raised mire in the Bystrzyckie wills range of Poland's Sudety Mountains aimed to determine dynamic trends for the site's peatland vegetation. resent vegetation was therefore characterized. An analysis of plant macroremains from peat cores was used to reconstruct the identity of the past peat-forming plant communities. Several succession stages of vegetation from the time of origin of the peatland through to the present day were indicated on this basis. Ecological indicative values of plant species were also used to determine the palaeohydrological changes experienced. Stages of the development of the tree stand growing on the mire were established from dendrochronology series. Results obtained point to an interruption of the succession of primary vegetation on the peatland around 250 years ago, when today's sparse tree stand of rhaetic pine, Norway spruce and downy birch began to develop. Nevertheless, the last 50 years have brought a reversal of this developmental trend, with elements typical for raised mire returning and the tree stand in retreat. These phenomena seem to have coincided with the onset of peatland drainage, followed by a gradual overgrowing of drainage ditches and consequent re-raising of water level in the mire, respectively.

AB The ecology of peatland testate amoebae is well studied along broad gradient from very wet (pool) to dry (hummock) micro-sites where testate amoebae are often found to respond primarily to the depth to water table (DWT). Much less is known on their responses to finer-scale gradients, and nothing is known of their possible response to phenolic compounds, which play a key role in carbon storage in peatlands. We studied the vertical (0-3, 3-6, and 6-9 cm sampling depths) micro-distribution patterns of testate amoebae in the same microhabitat (Sphagnum fallax lawn) along a narrow ecological gradient between a poor fen with an almost flat and homogeneous Sphagnum carpet (fen) and a "young bog" (bog) with more marked micro-topography and mosaic of poor fen and bog vegetation. We analyzed the relationships between the testate amoeba data and three sets of variables (1) "chemical" (pH, Eh potential, and conductivity), (2) "physical" (water temperature, altitude, i.e., Sphagnum mat micro-topography, and DWT), and (3) phenolic compounds in/from Sphagnum (water-soluble and primarily bound phenolics) as well as the habitat (fen/bog) and the sampling depth. Testate amoeba Shannon H' diversity, equitability J of communities, and total density peaked in lower parts of Sphagnum, but the patterns differed between the fen and bog micro-sites. Redundancy analyses revealed that testate amoeba communities differed significantly in relation to Eh, conductivity, water temperature, altitude, water-soluble phenolics, habitat, and sampling depth, but not to DWT, pH, or primarily bound phenolics. The sensitivity of testate amoebae to weak environmental gradients makes them particularly good integrators of micro-environmental variations and has implications for their use in paleoecology and environmental monitoring. The correlation between testate amoeba communities and the concentration of water-soluble phenolic suggests direct (e.g., physiological) and/or indirect (e.g., through impact on prey organisms) effects on testate amoebae, which requires further research.

AB Swiss Bogs of National Importance were designated as protected areas in 1991. However, their quality was found to have decreased over a 5-7 year monitoring period. In this article we assess the quality of the vegetation and its changes in 80 bogs throughout Switzerland. To determine change over time, 2912 pairs of records from revisited plots were compared. The indicator for quality was the ratio of specialists to the full species list in each record. We performed linear regressions to assess the proportion of variance explained by the variables: bog area, distance to edge, bog density, altitude and draining structures within the bog core areas and their surroundings. To specify the site conditions, we analysed Landolt's mean indicator values for light, humidity and nutrients. Finally, we derived a raw estimate of the loss in bog area. Distance to edge, bog density and draining structures outside the bogs had the best explanatory power for the quality of bog vegetation. The quality increased with distance from the edge. It correlated better with nutrients indicator values than with humidity values. With regard to quality changes, humidity indicator values decreased mainly in the bog centres, whereas increasing nutrients values and decreasing light values mainly affected the margins. We estimated that the loss of high quality surface affected about 0.6 % of the total Swiss bog area.

AB 1. Running waters, including associated riparian areas, are embraced by international legal frameworks outlining targets for the preservation, protection and improvement of the quality of the environment. Interactions between stream and river processes and riparian habitats have not received much attention in the management of stream ecosystems, and integrated measures that consider both the ecological status of streams and rivers (sensu EU Water Framework Directive, WFD) and the conservation status of riparian habitats and species (sensu EU Habitats Directive, HD) are rare.
   2. Here, we analysed the influence of stream size, morphology and chemical water characteristics for the distribution of water-dependent terrestrial habitat types, i.e. alkaline fens, periodically inundated meadows and meadows in riparian areas in Denmark using an extensive data set covering a total of 254 stream reaches. A species-based classification model was used to translate species lists into a standardised interpretation of habitat types protected by the HD in Denmark.
   3. No size dependency was found regarding the distribution of fen and meadow vegetation. Instead, the distribution of fen and meadow vegetation was strongly affected by the morphology of the streams. Alkaline fens, periodically inundated meadows and meadows occurred six, five and four times, respectively, less frequently along channelised compared with natural stream reaches. Our results indicate that stream channelisation strongly interfered with the natural hydrology of riparian areas, affecting conditions needed to sustain protected fen and meadow communities.
   4. We also found that water chemistry strongly influenced the occurrence of fen and meadow vegetation in riparian areas. The probability of finding fen and meadow vegetation was reduced when total phosphorus (TP) concentration exceeded 40-50 mu g P L-1, whereas meadow vegetation responded less strongly to TP.
   5. Our findings highlight the importance of restoring hydrology of riparian areas to improve conditions for fen and meadow vegetation, but also that the water chemistry should be considered when measures that increase hydrological connectivity result in an increase in the probability of flooding.

AB During the restoration of degraded bogs and other peatlands, both habitat and functional recovery can be closely linked with nutrient cycling, which is reflected in pore- and surface-water chemistry. Several peatland restoration studies have shown that the time required for recovery of target conditions is slow (>10 years); for heavily-impacted, drained and afforested peatlands of northern Scotland, recovery time is unknown. We monitored pore- and surface-water chemistry across a chronosequence of formerly drained, afforested bog restoration sites spanning 0-17 years, using a space-for-time substitution, and compared them with open blanket bog control sites. Our aims were to measure rate of recovery towards bog conditions and to identify the best suite of water chemistry variables to indicate recovery.
   Our results show progress in recovery towards bog conditions over a 0-17 year period post-restoration. Elements scavenged by trees (Mg, Na, S) completely recovered within that period. Many water chemistry variables were affected by the restoration process itself, but recovered within 11 years, except ammonium (NH4+), Zn and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which remained elevated (when compared to control bogs) 17 years post restoration. Other variables did not completely recover (water table depth (WTD), pH), exhibiting what we term "legacy" effects of drainage and afforestation. Excess N and a lowered WTD are likely to slow the recovery of bog vegetation including key bog plants such as Sphagnum mosses.
   Over 17 years, we measured near-complete recovery in the chemistry of surface-water and deep pore-water but limited progress in shallow pore-water. Our results suggest that at least >17 years are required for complete recovery of water chemistry to bog conditions. However, we expect that newer restoration methods including conifer harvesting (stem plus brash) and the blocking of plough furrows (to increase the WTD) are likely to accelerate the restoration process (albeit at greater cost); this should be evaluated in future studies. We conclude that monitoring pore- and surface-water chemistry is useful in terms of indicating recovery towards bog conditions and we recommend monitoring WTD, pH, conductivity, Ca, NH4+, phosphate (PO43-), K, DOC, Al and Zn as key variables.

AB This study examined the Pu-238 and 239+249PU activity concentration and the Pu-240/Pu-239 atomic ratio in peat bogs sampled in 2012 from marshlands in central Madagascar. The purpose was to investigate the., presence of plutonium isotopes, (238,) (239,) Pu-240, from the 1964 satellite failure carrying a SNAP-9A radiothermal generator. With an average Pu-238/Pu239+240 activity ratio of 0.165 +/- 0.02 (decay corrected to 1964), the peat bogs in Madagascar exhibit similar values as the ones found in the southeastern African continent, except they are one order of magnitude higher than expected (0.025) from global fallout in the Southern Hemisphere. The Pu-240/Pu-239 atomic ratio showed a distinct decrease for layers dating back to the mid-1960s (down to 0.069 compared with an anticipated ratio of 0.17 for global fallout), indicating that the SNAP-9A failure also resulted in an elevated deposition of Pu-239. The obtained results demonstrate that further Pu analysis in Madagascar and in southeastern continental Africa is necessary to fully account for the regional Pu deposition from the SNAP-9A event.

AB Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) originating in peatlands can be mineralized to carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), two potent greenhouse gases. Knowledge of the dynamics of DOC export via run-off is needed for a more robust quantification of C cycling in peatland ecosystems, a prerequisite for realistic predictions of future climate change. We studied dispersion pathways of DOC in a mountain-top peat bog in the Czech Republic (Central Europe), using a dual isotope approach. Although delta C-13(DOC) values made it possible to link exported DOC with its within-bog source, delta O-18(H2O) values of precipitation and run-off helped to understand run-off generation. Our 2-year DOC-H2O isotope monitoring was complemented by a laboratory peat incubation study generating an experimental time series of delta C-13(DOC) values. DOC concentrations in run-off during high-flow periods were 20-30 mg L-1. The top 2 cm of the peat profile, composed of decaying green moss, contained isotopically lighter C than deeper peat, and this isotopically light C was present in run-off in high-flow periods. In contrast, baseflow contained only 2-10 mg DOC L-1, and its more variable C isotope composition intermittently fingerprinted deeper peat. DOC in run-off occasionally contained isotopically extremely light C whose source in solid peat substrate was not identified. Pre-event water made up on average 60% of the water run-off flux, whereas direct precipitation contributed 40%. Run-off response to precipitation was relatively fast. A highly leached horizon was identified in shallow catotelm. This peat layer was likely affected by a lateral influx of precipitation. Within 36 days of laboratory incubation, isotopically heavy DOC that had been initially released from the peat was replaced by isotopically lighter DOC, whose delta C-13 values converged to the solid substrate and natural run-off. We suggest that delta C-13 systematics can be useful in identification of vertically stratified within-bog DOC sources for peatland run-off.

AB In 2007, a field visit by members of the International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG) to the Atlantic coast of Peninsula Mitre (the easternmost part of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, Argentina) gathered information on mire diversity in this remote wild area with largely pristine mires. Our expedition showed that Peninsula Mitre hosts a wide variety of habitats across two exciting ecological gradients: (i) a regional west-east gradient from Sphagnum magellanicum dominated mires in the west to Astelia pumila dominated mires in the east; and (ii) a gradient from extremely acid to extremely carbonate rich mire types induced by local bedrock. The large variety of hydromorphological mire types comprises raised bogs, blanket bogs, sloping fens, string fens, flat fens and calcareous spring fens. In the Atlantic coastal area, the abundance of Sphagnum magellanicum in the ombrogenic systems decreases conspicuously from west to east with the species being almost absent in the east. However, the fossil record shows thick layers of Sphagnum peat close beneath mire surfaces everywhere, indicating that substantial hydrological and ecological changes have taken place in the recent past. We observed large scale erosion in the mires along the Atlantic coast. Locally, well-developed fen systems are present, including calcareous spring fens with active travertine (tufa) deposition.
   The regional vegetation can be regarded as a parallel to that of boreal oceanic regions in the northern hemisphere. The mires and peatlands of the peninsula are of global significance. They are impressive, peculiar, extensive and largely pristine mires in a globally very rare climatic and biogeographical context embedded in a landscape with significant natural dynamics. The damaging impact of free-roaming cattle on the mires and upland vegetation is, however, conspicuous and needs urgent attention. Peninsula Mitre deserves the highest possible protection, e. g. as a provincial protected area and a World Heritage Site.

AB 1 In a 4-year fertilization experiment we studied the effects of increased nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) supply on productivity and potential decay in the acrotelm of Sphagnum-dominated Swedish peatlands at northern (low atmospheric N input: low-N site) and southern (high atmospheric N input: high-N site) sites.
   2 During the experimental period, there was a severe summer drought at the high-N site which led to strong limitations on Sphagnum growth, especially in the fertilized treatments. There were no significant effects of the nutrient treatments on cumulative length growth and productivity at either site. There were, however, significant effects of site and nutrient treatment on nutritional variables of the Sphagnum species.
   3 Nitrogen concentration in living capitula was lower, but P concentration was higher at the low-N site than at the high-N site. However, at both sites N and P concentration in the living capitula showed only minor responses to the nutrient additions.
   4 Litter chemistry variables differed significantly among sites and treatments. Sphagnum litter had lower N concentration, higher P concentration, a higher C : N ratio, a lower C : P ratio and a lower N : P ratio at the low-N site. Litter chemistry was significantly affected by the nutrient treatments only at the high-N site, where litter P concentrations increased significantly in the P-fertilized treatment, whereas C : P and N : P ratios showed a significant reduction.
   5 Although potential rates of decay of Sphagnum litter were higher at the high-N site than at the low-N site, they were not significantly affected by nutrient additions. Potential decay rates did, however, show significant relations with all the litter chemistry variables we had determined.
   6 An increase in nitrogen input to Sphagnum-dominated bogs appears to lead to higher N concentrations in litter and, as a result of dilution, to lower P concentrations. This change in litter chemistry leads to a higher potential decay rate of the litter and this may seriously affect the carbon balance in the acrotelm of these systems.
   7 Our results also show that carbon balance characteristics of Sphagnum bogs can be strongly affected by unpredictable extreme climatic conditions. This suggests that the occurrence and consequences of these events need more attention when long-term responses of ecosystems to global change are studied.

AB The effects of light year-round cattle grazing on tall-herb fen vegetation and wetland molluscs were compared to the effects of non-intervention over a period of four years using grazing exclosures. The distribution of cattle within the area of fen was investigated by plotting the position of the herd at 3-4 day intervals throughout the year. Cattle distributed themselves randomly throughout the fen in spring, autumn and winter, but showed a more aggregated distribution in summer. Grazing reduced the biomass of Phragmites australis and increased stem densities of Glyceria maxima, resulting in a shift of dominance from Phragmites to Glyceria. Plant species-richness was also significantly higher in areas open to grazing.
   Grazing decreased total densities of molluscs and substantially reduced densities of the rare snail Vertigo moulinsiana. V. moulinsiana was particularly associated with areas of fen that had a high water table and high biomass of ungrazed Carex riparia. However, because of the patchy nature of the grazing, V. moulinsiana survived at reasonably high densities in patches of ungrazed vegetation within the grazing unit. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Climate warming is likely to increase nutrient mineralization rates in bog ecosystems which may change the plant species composition. We examined the competitive relationships between two graminoid species, Eriophorum vaginatum and Rhynchospora alba, and two ericoid species, Calluna vulgaris and Vaccinium oxycoccus, at different nutrient supply rates. In a greenhouse, the plants were grown in monocultures and mixtures at four nutrient treatments: control, high N, high P, and high N + P. The results show that the ericoids responded more strongly to the nutrient treatments than the graminoids. The dwarf shrubs showed higher growth rates and reduced root:shoot ratio at high N + P supply. When grown in mixture the ericoids increased their growth, while graminoids decreased in biomass or showed signs of nutrient limitation compared to their monoculture plants. This suggests that under increased nutrient availability, bogs are more likely to turn into dwarf shrub dominated ecosystems and not grassland.

AB In order to measure the response of vegetation in Wainfleet Bog in southern Ontario to intense disturbance (total removal of vegetation and surface peat) associated with peat extraction, data were collected in each of four areas that had been regenerating for 1, 6, 10, and 24 years (3, 8, 12, and 26 years for tree data), as well as in a relatively less disturbed portion of the bog. Random plots were used to measure regrowth of vegetation in terms of mean height of vegetation, amount of bare substrate, number of plant species, similarity of species lists to the least disturbed area, and size and number of trees. Results indicate that the disturbed areas are regenerating quickly. However, the plots with regenerating vegetation differ from the relatively less disturbed plot in having a significantly higher density of woody vegetation and plant species lists that are 50% similar after 25 years of regeneration.

AB The bryophyte component of mire vegetation was analysed on 27 peatlands located on a transect from the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia to central Alberta. The habitats studied range from hyperoceanic bogs and poor fens to subcontinental moderate-rich fens. Habitat niche dimensions are calculated for 11 Sphagnum and 6 non- Sphagnum species along five climatic gradients and such ecological variables as surface water chemistry, height relative to the water table, and overstory cover. Species niche overlaps were calculated along five gradients: aridity index, corrected conductivity and pH of mire surface waters, height, and overstory cover. Habitat partitioning by Sphagnum species indicates that climate is the most important factor affecting species niches and overshadows on a regional basis such locally important ecological gradients as surface water chemistry and height relative to the water table. Niches of Sphagnum austinii, S. papillosum, S. rubellum, and S. tenellum are restricted to oceanic areas by the climate. Among non-Sphagnum species, the overstory cover, pH, conductivity, and height gradients are more extensively partitioned than the aridity index gradient. Niche shifts among widespread bog and poor fen species, and species packing along the height gradients, suggest a competitive hierarchy where: 1) Sphagnum species are better competitors than most non-Sphagnum species; 2) lawn and carpet species are better competitors than hummock species; and 3) oceanic species are better competitors than widespread species.

AB (1) Eighty-six examples of rich-fen vegetation, representing the main types of herbaceous rich-fen plant communities of lowland England and Wales, were sampled to determine above-ground crop-mass components. (2) Above-ground standing crop (living material) (SC) and litter (dead material) was estimated by harvesting clipped material near the start (April) and end (September) of the main growing season and the increment of above-ground standing crop ('production') was calculated. (3) September standing crop and litter-mass values ranged from 80 to 2918 g m-2 and 37 to 2115 g m-2, respectively. The April-September net standing crop increment ranged from 58 to 2799 g m-2. Communities of highest production were almost always deciduous and had very small April standing crop mass. Conversely most low productivity stands had proportionately large April SC mass, reflecting their winter-green character. (4) Stands with greatest September standing crop usually had small proportions of September litter, probably because of rapid decomposition. An exception to this was some stands dominated by Cladium mariscus where large September standing crop and litter mass was combined. Some of these stands had the greatest total crop mass (maximum: 5011 g m-2). (5) All crop variables except April SC showed a significant negative relationship with species density (number of spp. 4 m-2) in regressions (log(c)-transformed variables). April-September SC increment (36%) and September SC (32%) accounted for most variation in species density in single regressions. A stepwise multiple-regression model included only the SC increment term. The poorer fit of September SC mass probably occurred because, unlike SC increment, some samples of high September SC were relatively species rich, partly a legacy of former, or present rotational, management. (6) When 'rare fen species score' (number of rare species 4 m-2 was the dependent variable, similar relationships were found but the crop mass variables generally accounted for rather less of its variation. The slopes of the regression equations were significantly (P < 0.05) steeper than those using species density, and samples with large crop mass had particularly few, if any, rare species. (7) Maintenance of low-growing swards of herbaceous fen vegetation is particularly important for the conservation of many rare fen species.

AB Two peatlands, a fen and a bog in southern Finland, were studied for peat and carbon accumulation rates, chemical and physical properties of the peat pro. le, and past vegetation, to assess what stage of succession these peatlands were at the time of human impacts, drainage and restoration. Paludification started at both sites soon after the glacial retreat around 9000 radiocarbon years BP. Peat accumulated at the fen site at an average rate of 0.28 mm yr(-1) (range 0.16-0.58 mm yr(-1)) during development. The peat was composed mostly of Carex with remains of Pinus sylvestris and Betula spp. The bog site had an average accumulation rate of 0.47 mm yr(-1) (range 0.25-1.19 mm yr(-1)), and a minerotrophic sedge stage of about 2000 years in its early development, after which the peat was composed mostly of Sphagna. The long-term rates of carbon accumulation (LORCA) varied from 6.6 to 15.3 g m(-2) yr(-1) (average 11.1 g m(-2) yr(-1)) for the fen and from 6.1 to 21.1 g m(-2) yr(-1) (average 13.2 g m(-2) yr(-1)) for the bog. The main trend in peat chemistry of both mires was the change from higher to lower nutrient levels with an increased acidity towards the surface peat. The main changes in peat chemistry occurred between 4600 and 4200 BP, simultaneously with the spread of Picea abies in the area. This period was preceded by a large-scale climatic change at the boundary between Atlantic and Subboreal chronozones. Drainage during the twentieth century caused compaction in the uppermost peat of the fen, whereas evidence of drainage was hardly noticeable in the bog stratigraphy.

AB Vegetation succession, drainage, and climate change are causes of peatland habitat loss in the Western Balkans. Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the most ecologically important invertebrate taxa in terrestrial ecosystems. To explore whether, and to what extent, fen ant communities are specialized, we sampled an alkaline fen, adjacent habitats undergoing vegetation succession, and the surrounding beech forest in west-central Croatia. Here, we show how a fen and its surrounding habitats differ in ant community structure, and which of the environmental variables (soil temperature, moisture, and pH) have the strongest impact in shaping those communities. In the two growing seasons of sampling we recorded 16 ant species, none of which were peatland specialists. While species richness did not differ between the sites, species diversity was the highest at a succession site. Specific environmental conditions of the fen limit colony establishment and allow survival of a small subset of ant species from the surrounding habitats. Consequently, only two ant species (Myrmica rubra and Lasius platythorax) were abundant at the fen site. Their presence at other study sites indicates that the fen fauna is composed of generalist species. The fen and forest community composition differed from the successional sites, and it was most strongly affected by soil pH. The fauna of these habitat islands completely lacks peatland-specific ant species. Knowing more about communities of these disappearing habitats will help us predict future biodiversity losses in similar habitats threatened by vegetation succession.

AB To study the relationship between mire vegetation and ecological variables we tested the Finnish hypothesis that the mire margin to expanse gradient in vegetation composition relates to a gradient of solutes (main plant nutrients) in the soil that is separate from the mainly pH related poor-rich gradient. Successional mire basins where mire margin to expanse is the prominent gradient were surveyed. An indirect method (Ellenberg indicator values) and direct measurements (phosphorous concentrations, pH) were used to assess the relationship between the mire margin to expanse and nutrients gradients. Vegetation with indicators of Subtype A mire margin vegetation (assumed to reflect surface water flow) correlated best with Ellenberg nitrogen values, whereas Subtype B (assumed to reflect groundwater influence) correlated best with Ellenberg reaction values. Subtype C (supposed to reflect mineral soil influence) did not correlate with these Ellenberg values. The study provides information about the complexity of the vegetational gradients. In general, water flow seems to be related to the poor-rich gradient, but surface water flow is also related to the nutrients gradient. Subtype C (influence of mineral soil) seems to differ from the other two subtypes of the mire margin to expanse gradient and also from the poor-rich gradient. It is prominent on forested sites, where the water table is comparatively deep.

AB We determined aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in five mires in the South-eastern Alps of Italy. The mires differed considerably from each other with regard to pore-water chemistry, ranging from bog to rich fen. In different habitat types (hummock, scrub, lawn, fen meadow, hollow and marginal stream) within each mire type we assessed nutrient status based on measurements of nutrient concentrations and nutrient ratios in the plant biomass in order to test whether ANPP patterns along the poor-rich gradient could be related to the limiting effects of one or several nutrients for biomass production. Vegetation composition varied considerably both among mire sites and among habitat types in terms of individual species and plant functional types (PFTs). Nonetheless, mean ANPP was similar in the five mires. However, ANPP showed a positive correlation with total P concentration and negative correlations with the N:P ratio and with the K:P ratio of the vegetation. We conclude that plant biomass production is limited by P, rather than by other nutrients, across a broad range of mire types in this region.

AB Traditionally mire ecosystems (especially bogs) have been viewed as stable systems with slow changes in the vegetation over time. In this study the mire Akhultmyren, south-central Sweden was re-investigated in 1997 after 40 yr of continued natural development. The results show a high degree of dynamics in a Sphagnum dominated bog and fen. Altogether 97 vascular plant and bryophyte species were recorded in the two inventories of the bog and poor fen vegetation. pH and electrical conductivity in the mire water were also surveyed. In 1997 we found 10 new species and that 8 species had disappeared since 1954 but the over-all mean number of species per plot (size 400 m(2)) had hardly changed. However, 21% of the species increased and 21% decreased significantly in frequency. Most of the species that decreased in frequency were low-grown vascular plants, most common in wet microhabitats. Vascular plant species that increased in frequency included trees (defined as > 1.3 m in height) and were generally taller than the unchanged or decreasing species. The frequency of dwarf shrubs and hummock bryophytes increased too. Areas with an initial pH of 4.5-5.0 showed the strongest decrease in pH, coinciding with an enlarged distribution of some Sphagnum species. The species diversity increased on the bog, but decreased in the wettest parts of the fen, where the pH also decreased. Species with unchanged or increasing frequency often showed high capacity to colonise new plots. On average the sum of gains and losses of species in the plots in 1997 was ca 50% of the species number in 1954. The vegetation changes indicate a drier mire surface and an increased availability of nitrogen. The increased tree cover may have triggered further changes in the plant cover.

AB In temperate mountains, fens have been reported as relict habitats subject to geographical fragmentation and broad climatic gradients, but few studies have analyzed the influence of these factors on plant diversity. Here we investigate the effect of isolation on the vegetation diversity of rich fens (Caricion davallianae) in the mountains of the Iberian Peninsula, the distribution limit of these habitats in south-western Europe. We used plot-based vegetation data from the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian mountain range to evaluate their regional species-pool, occurrence of specialists, beta-diversity and the effect of geo-climatic variables on their species-richness and species-composition. We found a lower ratio of rare specialists in the Pyrenees than in the Cantabrian range, but similar estimates in the species pools, total species-richness per plot and beta-diversity. The isolation of the two mountain regions resulted in different species assemblages best predicted by summer precipitation and bedrock types, showing region-based differences in the response of vegetation and plant specialists to the environment. The tighter correlation between local climate and diversity estimates in the Cantabrian range suggests relict character of rich fens in that region, where climatic conditions have restricted local distribution of formerly more widely distributed specialists. Although there is no relevant evidence of vegetation impoverishment in that region, historical isolation has probably resulted in the existence of fragmentary plant communities. We conclude that fen vegetation may experience long-time persistence in climatically sub-optimal mountain refugia, but related plant specialists may be sensitive to climatic changes and subject to the extinction of local populations.

Klinggr.) and fen (Carex aquatilis Wahlenb. leaves and rhizomes and Salix planifolia Pursh leaves and roots). Plant tissue quality variables, including total phosphorus and total nitrogen tissue concentrations, correlated most strongly with the fungal communities. In contrast, site-specific environmental (surface water chemical variables) and physical (peat and water temperatures, water level) variables were not correlated with the fungal communities of these five decomposing fen and bog plant litters. Of 93 identified fungal taxa, 25% occurred exclusively in the bog and 56% occurred exclusively in the fen. Eighteen species (19%) were common to the materials examined from both peatlands. Several species of (i) Aspergillus, Mortierella, and Oidiodendron were restricted to the Sphagnum litter in the bog, and species of (ii) Phialophora, Phialocephala, Fusarium, Dimorphospora foliicola, Monocillium constrictum, and several basidiomycetes were restricted to the Carex and Salix plant litters in the fen. These taxa constitute components of the bog and fen fungal communities, respectively.

AB Questions: Does restoration management of a formerly afforested blanket bog lead to the vegetation, and the environmental conditions it indicates, becoming similar to intact bog?
   Location: A 147-ha blanket bog in Scotland's Flow Country, afforested in the 1980s but undergoing restoration since 1998.
   Methods: Vegetation in the restoration area was surveyed in nine, 1.6-6.4-ha plots, in 1998, 2003 and 2011. Each plot was matched to nearby plots that were either intact bog or remained afforested. Principal Response Curves were used to highlight the main axes of vegetation variation and test whether plant community trajectories in the restoration area differed from intact bog. The following restoration outcomes were assessed: floristic similarity to bog vegetation; and moisture, fertility and acidity, as inferred from vegetation using Ellenberg indicator values.
   Results: In the 6 years after restoration began, vegetation developed towards bog-like conditions. In the subsequent 8 years, overall vegetation change stalled, and spatial variability increased, reflecting diverging trajectories in wetter and drier parts of the site. Ellenberg's F-values implied significant re-wetting in the restoration area, reaching moisture levels similar to intact bog. Other restoration outcomes progressed in wetter microsites and areas (furrows and flat ground), but stalled in drier locations (plough-ridges and steeper slopes).
   Conclusions: Overall moisture conditions, as indicated by plants, have recovered. However, restoration progress has stalled in drier areas, where additional management may be needed. Long-term vegetation monitoring has helped clarify barriers to recovery and the management needed to overcome them. The value of such monitoring schemes in guiding restoration should be reflected in their wider implementation, within an adaptive management framework.

AB The Towada-a (To-a) Tephra from A.D. 915 allowed reconstruction of the local and regional vegetation at and near Ohse-yachi Mire from pollen samples taken just below the tephra. In earlier studies the tephra was dated from C-14 data, stratigraphy at archaeological sites and a historical record. Twelve cores along two perpendicular transects yielded pollen from modern and pre-tephra samples. The modern pollen data were compared with the modern vegetation, and used to interpret the pollen data from A.D. 915. Ericaceae, Drosera, Sanguisorba, other Rosaceae, and Sphagnum were concluded to be local elements. Ohse-yachi Mire was a wet Sphagnum bog in A.D. 915, with Sphagnum dominating the central part of the mire. The present stand of scrub was not yet established, but there was a stand of Pinus pumila scrub. The bog subsequently became drier and changed to the present-day mixed Moliniopsis-Sphagnum bog.

DE MECHANICAL PEAT CUTTING; BLANKET BOG; LAND USE CHANGE; MONITORING;
   PEATLAND
AB The amount of blanket peat in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) in Northern Ireland, its associated vegetation and recent changes in peatland exploitation have been estimated from a random sample of 25 ha grid squares stratified by multivariate land class.
   The total estimated area of peatland, defined on the basis of its vegetation, was 1190 km2, with approximately one third of this consisting of intact peat. The total estimated area of machine cut peat was 51.7 km2. Estimates of the area of peatland with active hand cutting, disused hand cutting, new drains, old drains, disturbance, burning and erosion have also been established.
   The rate of increase of mechanical peat cutting between 1987-1989 was marked in the Sperrins AONB (14.7% annual increase), particularly in wet bog. Most machine cut plots were being harvested by auger cutters for domestic purposes with a quarter of plots being cut commercially. Access to peat was largely by traditional tracks but in Fermanagh, a high proportion of plots were being accessed along recently constructed tracks.
   Regional variation in the composition and distribution of peatland vegetation is described, together with the methods and socio-economic context of mechanized peat extraction. The ecological effects of land use change on blanket bog vegetation are discussed, particularly in relation to peat extraction, agriculture and nature conservation.

AB Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were supplied to some Belgian fens of varying nutrient status and productivity. Plant growth in the lowest productive fen with a species-rich Caricion davallianae vegetation was strongly P-limited. N was ineffective when applied alone, but increased the effect of P-addition when applied together. Summer biomass and plant nutrient concentrations were monitored for four years, and showed partial recovery of nutrient limitation. In a more productive fen dominated by Carer lasiocarpa and in a fen meadow, nutrient limitation was less strong. N limited growth in the productive fen, and N and K were co-limiting in the fen meadow. The P-concentration in the productive fen vegetation showed a marked increase after P-fertilization, but it did not result in higher standing crop. The significance of P-limitation for the conservation of species rich low productive fens is discussed. P-limitation may be an essential feature in the conservation of low productive rich fens: because it is less mobile in the landscape than N and/or because it is an intrinsic property of this vegetation type. Plant nutrient concentrations and N:P-ratios may be used as an indication for the presence and type of nutrient limitation in the vegetation. We found N:P-ratios of 23 to 31 for a P-limited site and 8 to 15 in N-limited sites. This was in agreement with critical values from the literature: N:P > ca. 20 for P-limitation and N:P < 14 for N-limitation. Thus, this technique appears valid in the vegetation types that were studied here.

AB Land-use and climate change are expected to cause drying of vegetation and surface soils in continental boreal peatlands. We examined the effects of multi-decadal drying and drainage on plant community structure and productivity in four fens located in Alberta, Canada. Long-term drying resulted in a two to fourfold increase in total biomass in three of the four fen sites, with a similar large increase in NPP in Treed Fen 1. The treed poor fens consistently had decreased moss cover and productivity with drainage. Across all sites, changes in understory community composition were related to the change in water table position as well as overstory canopy development that occurred post-drainage. Overall, drainage induced a shift toward a drier peatland regime, favoring increased canopy and vascular plant density at the expense of ground-layer mosses or the understory. Within the ground layer communities, drainage favored dry-adapted hummock moss and lichen species over those wet-adapted but dessication-prone species typical of low-lying lawns and hollows. Alteration of fen vegetation due to ecosystem drying will not only influence carbon sequestration but also will increase the vulnerability of peatlands to wildfire, increasing the risk of further ecosystem degradation and possible loss of resilience.

AB Stable isotope analysis was used to determine the distribution of methanogenic pathways at permafrost collapse scar bogs to test the hypothesis that microbial respiration and methane production are stimulated by the input of organic matter associated with permafrost degradation and collapse. An alternative hypothesis is that recently assimilated carbon produced by the fen-like vegetation ( Carex, Eriophorum) growing in open water moats formed by the collapsing edge of these features stimulates microbial respiration. We found that CO2 reduction was the dominant pathway for methanogenesis within the Sphagnum areas that dominate the surface cover of these features, but relatively more acetate fermentation occurred near collapse scar moats. Methane emission and net CO uptake were correlated. Both were elevated in collapse scar moats and then decreased along a transect from the moats toward the center Sphagnum-dominated areas. There also appeared to be a shift toward relatively more acetate fermentation in deeper samples associated with increasing cation ( calcium and magnesium) concentrations. Our results indicate that organic inputs from permafrost degradation alone do not appear to stimulate acetate fermentation. Permafrost decomposition provides conditions along the collapsing edge that are conducive to colonization by fen-like vegetation that stimulates acetate fermentation and increases methane production and emission rates.

AB Question: We studied vegetation succession after drainage in a bog, as an analogue for potential persistent water table drawdown due to climate change. We asked: (1) how does bog vegetation change following a long-term water table lowering and (2) how are effects of drainage on hydrology and vegetation distributed temporally and spatially?
   Location: Mer Bleue peatland, Ontario, Canada (45.41 degrees N, 75.48 degrees W).
   Methods: Analyses of changes in vegetation and hydrology associated with drainage were examined spatially along a hydrosequence and temporally using paleoecological reconstructions from peat cores (testate amoebae, pollen) in a drained portion of a peatland untouched for 85 years following drainage. Relationships between modern vegetation and water table were assessed through clustering and ordination analyses of vegetation releves.
   Results: Post-drainage increases in tree cover, especially Betula and Larix, decreases in Sphagnum cover and shifts in species composition of dominant shrubs were observed. Present-day vegetation patterns along the hydrosequence were primarily related to seasonal variability of water table depth. Paleoecological records reveal that where the present-day vegetation has been impacted by drainage, persistent water table lowering occurred in response to drainage. However, in an area with relatively natural vegetation, a transient drop in water table depth occurred at the time of drainage.
   Conclusions: Temporal and spatial patterns revealed that the bog response to drainage was spatially and temporally heterogeneous, and probably mediated by feedbacks among vegetation, peat structure and hydrology. Spatial patterns along the hydrosequence were similar to those observed in paleoecological reconstructions, but the use of the two complementary techniques provides additional insights.

AB Boreal and subarctic peatlands contain 20-30% of the world's soil organic carbon, and if growing, they constitute sinks for atmospheric CO2. We hypothesized that even in the nutrient-poor bog environment, elevated CO2 would stimulate Sphagnum growth more than vascular plant growth, thereby improving Sphagnum's competitive strength and enhancing carbon (C) sequestration.
   Free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments took place on predominantly ombrotrophic peatbog-lawns in Finland (FI), Sweden (SW), The Netherlands (NL), and Switzerland (CH).
   After 3 yr of treatment, increased CO2 concentration (560 ppm on volume basis) had no significant effect on Sphagnum or Vascular plant biomass at either site.
   This research suggests that, just as with other nutrient-poor ecosystems, increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations will have a limited effect on bog ecosystems.

AB Central-European raised bogs, developed on mountain summits, are specific ecosystems of high conservation importance, but their history remains largely unknown. Pollen, macrofossils, testate amoebae and peat characteristics were analysed in a peat sequence of the Vozka bog (Hruby Jesenik Mountains, Eastern Sudetes, Czech Republic). Past water chemistry and water-table depths were reconstructed by transfer functions calibrated from recent testate amoeba data and long-term environmental averages. Peat initiation started in the middle Holocene (approximately 4200 BC) by the process of paludification, resembling the development of Atlantic blanket bogs. Around 100 BC the vegetation changed from Eriophorum vaginatum-poor fen to the ombrotrophic-bog vegetation similar to the recent situation. A hiatus in peat sequence was revealed between AD 1320 and 1954. It can be explained either by human activities, or by an extreme drought causing decomposition of previously accumulated peat. Local bog development was largely independent of landscape development inferred from pollen records. In the middle Holocene, mixed spruce-elm-hazel woodland was recorded close to the treeline. During 2400-800 BC a gradual transition to mixed spruce-fir woodlands with admixture of beech took place, and from approximately 800 BC spruce and fir became dominant. The major human impact started approximately AD 1230 and was connected with settlement and mining in the foothills.

AB Wetland vegetation in the sub(alpine) zone of the West Carpathians (Poland, Slovakia) was studied with particular reference to the following questions: (i) What are the main types of (sub)alpine fen, bog and spring vegetation above the timberline in the West Carpathians? (ii) Which major environmental gradients are associated with the variation in floristic composition? (iii) What determines the alpha-diversity of bryophytes and vascular plants in the different vegetation types? Vegetation plots were sampled and direct measurements of certain environmental characteristics recorded. Cluster analysis was used to distinguish the vegetation types, DCA and CCA to reveal the main vegetation gradients and environmental factors, and general regression models to identify the factors determining the alpha-diversity. Classification at the level of 12 clusters was ecologically and syntaxonomically interpretable. Two associations not mentioned in the most recent vegetation survey of Slovakia were distinguished and the syntaxonomical positions of others revised. The synthesis of collected and published vegetation data for the two countries has modified the classification concept of (sub)alpine wetlands in the West Carpathians. Whereas pH predominantly determined floristic differences among classes, different factors governed the species composition within classes. While the diversity of the vegetation of springs (Montio-Cardaminetea) was mostly determined by water chemistry, altitude and geomorphology appeared to be more important within fens and bogs. The species richness of spring vegetation was more influenced by mineral richness than water pH and for bryophyte richness the slope inclination was also important. The species richness of fens and bogs increased with pH. It is concluded that the ecological gradients influencing the floristic composition and species richness of (sub)alpine wetlands are strongly habitat-dependent.

AB We studied 45 mid-boreal wetlands in a rugged land uplift coast with a thin cover of till. Wetlands ranged from 1 to 53 m a.s.l. and were of highly various sizes. Our aims were to examine, if vegetation types are valid in comparing wetlands, what kind of ecological major pattern the vegetation type composition of wetlands shows and how vegetation types distribute across altitudes. On those ground we discuss the wetland succession of the study area. We used the Finnish mire site types as vegetation types. Mire site types could be used for an ecological classification and ordination of the wetlands. As was expected, the major gradient consisted of the transition from mire margin (swamp) to expanse. The distribution of the Major Vegetational Wetland Groups (MVWG) responded to a general water-flow pattern in the landscape. Partly different peatland succession sequences occur in areas with small mire basins and in areas with larger mire basins with evolving mire complexes. Sequences of small wetlands and those of mire complexes follow the same trajectory only as far as the major gradient is considered while they differ with regard to the vegetation type composition of locally rare vegetation types and with regard to peatland morphology. Trajectories of mire complexes at catchment divides differ from those at catchment centers where the waters in the landscape tend to gather. Peatland forms of aapa mires experience a change reaching altitudes of 30-50 m a.s.l. Small bog complexes at catchment divides reach a stage of an unpatterned Sphagnum fuscum bog in the study area. Mature mixed complexes with aapa-mire parts and patterned sloping-bog parts only occur at altitudes higher than 60 m a.s.l. Peculiarities in the succession of the wetlands of Nyby, which include the presence of separate incomplete successional sequences in the same area, are mainly caused by the peculiar topography with various sub-areas and with an abundance of rock outcrops.

AB The use of data for present-day vegetation, modern and pretephra pollen have, together, allowed reconstruction of the spatial pattern of the vegetation of an oligotrophic mire, Shimo-kenashi Mire, in AD 915. The modern pollen data were compared with the surrounding vegetation, showing that pollen of Ericaceae, Rosaceae (excluding Sanguisorba), Sphagnum and Liliaceae, together with trees and shrubs, which form scrub or thicket, indicate the limits of the mires. Shimo-kenashi Mire was narrower in AD 915 and had more islands and peninsulas of scrub. Subsequently, the mire margin has advanced and the scrub islands and peninsulas have disappeared at some sites. The fact that the mire is spreading implies that conditions are wetter since AD 915, caused by changes in local hydrology. This history of vegetation at the site will contribute to the conservation and management of the mire as trends in vegetational change provide the basic information for conservation strategy.

AB The post-drainage changes in vegetation composition and carbon balance were studied on four site types (from minero- to ombrotrophic conditions) in Lakkasuo mire, central Finland, by directly comparing undrained and drained parts (30 years ago) of the mire. Drainage had drastically changed the species composition of the sites, especially at the minerotrophic sites, where almost all Sphagna had been replaced by forest mosses. On the ombrotrophic sites much of the mire vegetation still remained 30 years after drainage. Drainage had decreased the C stores in ground vegetation on the minerotrophic sites but increased them on the ombrotrophic sites. The changes were, however, very small compared to the changes in the tree stand, where the C stores had increased at all sites (increasing with nutrient level). The change in peat C balance over the 30-year post-drainage period was negative on the most nutrient-rich site, and positive on the others, increasing with lower nutrient levels. The decrease in the peat C balance on the most nutrient-rich site was compensated by the greater increase in the tree stand C stores and the changes in the total C balance (peat+tree stand+ground vegetation) remained positive on all sites.

AB On the basis of cluster analysis of phytosociological releves, the mire vegetation in the Rhaetian Alps was arranged in sixteen plant communities syntaxonomically included in four classes. The class Potametea was characterised by two different plant communities of perennial hydrophytes rooting in the bottom sediment of lakes (communities of Potamogeton alpinus and Potamogeton natans, respectively). The class Littorelletea included two plant communities characteristic of shallow water bodies (Callitricho-Sparganietum and community of Ranunculus reptans). The class Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae included small-sedge swards and quaking rafts spanning a broad range of hydrochemical conditions with 8 plant communities and 5 alliances. The alliance Rhynchosporion albae included the vegetation of hollows and shallow ponds in nutrient-poor mires, with the Caricetum limosae and a community of Eriophorum angustifolium. The alliance Caricion lasiocarpae, including vegetation of hollows and pools in intermediate mires, was represented by an only association, the Caricetum rostratae. The alliance Caricion nigrae included sedge-swards in acid fens, with the Caricetum nigrae, the Caricetum pauperculae, the Menyantho-Sphagnetum teretis and the Eriophoretum scheuchzeri. The alliance Caricion davallianae included rich fen vegetation with an only association, the Drepanoclado-Trichophoretum cespitosi. The C ari cion atrofusco-saxatilis included only the Caricetum microglochinis, a carbonate fen association in the alpine vegetation belt. The class Oxycocco-Sphagnetea corresponded to the vegetation of Sphagnum hummocks in ombrogenous mires, with three associations: the Sphagnetum magellanici, the Eriophoro-Trichophoretum cespitosi and the Pinetum rotundatae. The habitat in all plant communities was defined on the basis of pH and electrical conductivity of porewater, reflecting the degree of inflow of geogenous water. The role of elevation in affecting the distribution of plant communities was particularly clear for the associations of the class Oxycocco-Sphagnetea, which were mainly developed in the lower sub-alpine vegetation belt, and for the Eriophoretum scheuchzeri, confined to the alpine vegetation belt.

AB Question: Has the vegetation of Sphagnum bogs been affected by more than 200 years of human activities?
   Location: Bas-Saint-Laurent region, southeastern Quebec, Canada.
   Methods: Data (species assemblages, abiotic and spatio-historical variables) were collected in 16 bogs ranging from 2 to 189 ha. and incorporated in a geographical information system. Major gradients in vegetation composition were identified using DCA. CCA was used to relate vegetation gradients to abiotic and spatio-historical variables.
   Results: A clear segregation of species assemblages was observed, from open and undisturbed bogs to forested and highly disturbed sites. Among abiotic factors, tree basal area. water table level and peat thickness had a significant influence on plant species composition. Among spatio-historical factors. disturbance level, area loss and fire were the most influential factors. Variance partitioning between these groups of factors suggests that spatio-historical factors had a major influence on peatlands. representing 22% of the variation observed in the plant species assemblages while abiotic factors represent only 17% of the variation.
   Conclusions: The results highlight the influence of agricultural and other anthropogenic activities on plant assemblages and suggest that even wetlands apparently resistant to disturbances. such as peatlands, can be severely affected by anthropogenic factors. Plant species assemblages of ombrotrophic peatlands of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region were, and still are, largely influenced by human activities.

AB Questions: What vegetational changes does a boreal rich fen (alkaline fen) undergo during a time period of 24 years after drainage? How is plant species richness affected, and what are the changes in composition of ecological groups of species? Is it possible to recover parts of the original flora by rewetting the rich fen? Which are the initial vegetation changes in the flora after rewetting? What are the major challenges for restoration of rich fen flora after rewetting?
   Location: Eastern central Sweden, southern boreal vegetational zone. Previously rich fen site, drained for forestry purposes during 1978-1979. The site was hydrologically restored (rewetted) in 2002.
   Method: Annual vegetation survey in permanent plots during a period of 28 years.
   Results: There were three successional stages in the vegetational changes. In the first stage there was a rapid (< 5 years) loss of rich fen bryophytes. The second step was an increase of sedges and early successional bryophytes, which was followed by an increase of a few emerging dominants, such as Molinia caerulea, Betula pubescens and Sphagnum spp. After rewetting, there are indications of vegetation recovery, albeit at slow rates. Depending on, for instance, initial species composition different routes of vegetation change were observed in the flora after drainage, although after 24 years, species composition became more homogenous and dominated by a few species with high cover.
   Conclusion: Major changes have occurred after changes in the hydrology (drainage and rewetting) with a severe impact on the biodiversity among vascular plants and bryophytes. Several rich fen bryophytes respond quickly to the changes in water level (in contrast to vascular plants). The recovery after rewetting towards the original rich fen vegetation is slow, as delayed by substrate degradation, dispersal limitation and presence of dominant species.

AB Southern Sweden has long been exposed to an increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We investigated the effects of this supply on the Sphagnum mire vegetation in SW Gotaland by comparing above-ground tissue concentrations of N and P and biomass variables in five vascular plant and two Sphagnum species collected during three periods since 1955 at 81 sites representing three vegetation types, viz. ombrotrophic bog, extremely poor fen and moderately poor fen, within two areas differing in annual N deposition. The N:P ratios in the plants were rarely below 17, suggesting P as the growth-limiting mineral nutrient. In the vascular plants both growth and concentrations of N and P were highest in the moderately poor fen sites because of a higher mineralization rate, the differences between the extremely poor fen and bog sites being smaller in these respects. In the extremely poor fen and bog sites the N concentrations were slightly higher in the area with the highest N deposition. From 1955 to 2002 the concentration of N in the Sphagnum spp. increased proportionally to the supply rate while P remained constant. In the vascular plants the concentrations of P remained constant while N showed slightly decreasing trends in the bog and extremely poor fen sites, but since the size of the plants increased the biomass content of N and P increased, too. The increased N deposition has had its greatest effects on the site types with the highest Sphagnum biomass and peat accumulation rate. The high N concentration in the Sphagnum mosses probably reduced their competitiveness and facilitated the observed expansion of vascular plants. However, the increased N deposition might also have triggered an increased mineralization in the acrotelm increasing the supply of P to the vascular plants and thus also their productivity. This may also explain the slightly higher productivity among the vascular plants in the area with the highest N deposition rate. In conclusion, it seems as the increased N deposition has directly influenced only the growth of the Sphagnum mosses and that the effects on the growth of the vascular plants are indirect.

AB We studied the effect of afforestation on soil CO2 emissions in blanket peat. The study sites were as follows: two undrained blanket peatland sites, six sites which had been drained and afforested 3, 19, 23, 27, 33 and 39 years previously, and two forest sites which were clearfelled in summer 1996. Soil CO2 emissions were measured using the soda-lime method during 13 sampling campaigns throughout 1997. Each campaign consisted of two consecutive 24-h measurements. Comparison of the average annual CO2 emission revealed no clear pattern in relation to soil type and suggests that afforestation does not always lead to an increase in soil CO2 emissions. In the most recently forested site, CO2 emissions were similar to 1.7 t C ha(-1) a(-1) and drainage had failed to lower the water-table sufficiently to cause a large increase in CO2 emissions. In the 19-, 23-, 27- and 33-year-old sites soil CO2 emissions were similar to 1.0-1.4 t C ha(-1) a(-1) and were similar to, or lower than, levels in the undrained sites. In the 39-year-old site average CO2 emissions were 2.6 t C ha(-1) a(-1). In the clearfelled sites CO2 emissions were lower at between 1.4 and 1.6 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Root respiration appears to account for a large proportion of CO2 emissions, and blanket peat, despite drainage, is resistant to decay. It is concluded that losses of soil C are compensated by C uptake by the trees.

AB In the oil sands development region near Fort McMurray, Alberta, wetlands cover similar to 62 % of the landscape, and similar to 95 % of these wetlands are peatlands. A saline fen was studied as a reference site for peatland reclamation. Despite highly saline conditions, a freshwater bog was observed in the path of local saline groundwater flow. The purpose of this study was to identify the hydrological controls that have allowed the development and persistence of a bog in this setting. The presence of bog vegetation and its dilute water chemistry suggest that saline groundwater from the fen rarely enters the bog, which functions predominantly as a groundwater recharge system. Chloride (Cl-) and sodium (Na+) were the dominant ions in fen water, with concentrations averaging 5394 and 2307 mg L-1, respectively, while the concentrations in bog water were 5 and 4 mg L-1, respectively. These concentrations were reflected by salinity and electrical conductivity measurements, which in the fen averaged 9.3 ppt, and 15.8 mS cm(-1), respectively, and in the bog averaged 0.1 ppt and 0.3 mS cm(-1), respectively. A small ridge in the mineral substratum was found at the fen-bog margin, which created a persistent groundwater mound. Under the dry conditions experienced in early summer, groundwater flow was directed away from the bog at a rate of 14.6 mm day(-1). The convex water table at the fen-bog margin impeded flow of saline water into the bog and instead directed it around the bog margin. However, the groundwater mound was eliminated during flooding in autumn, when the horizontal hydraulic gradient across the margin became negligible, suggesting the possibility of saline water ingress into the bog under these conditions.

AB The contribution of different methanogenic precursors probably depends on vegetation in the cold Zoige peatlands. This study was carried out to elucidate the relationship between archaeal community dynamics and vegetation type over growing season. Soil samples were collected monthly during the growing season from two vegetation types (communities dominated by Carex muliensis vs. Eleocharis valleculosa) on an open fen at the Wetland National Nature Reserve of the Zoige peatlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Archaeal community structure was determined with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 16S rRNA gene fragment. Methanosarcinales, Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriales, uncultured RC-II, and uncultured Crenarchaeota were detected in both vegetation types. The results suggested that seasonal change affects the activity rather than the structure of the archaeal community over the growing season. Ordination analyses indicated that archaeal community composition was related to vegetation type and plant height.

AB The paper presents the results of phytosociological research on spring and fen vegetation of the western Pamir-Alai Mountains in Tajikistan. In total, 211 releves were sampled during field studies conducted in 2008-2013 and 2015 with application of the Braun-Blanquet method. Plant communities of spring heads and peat-accumulated fens inhabiting the high montane and alpine zones in the Zerayshan, Hissar, Hazratishoh, Darvaz, Turkestan and Peter the 1st Mountains are described. A hierarchical syntaxonomic synopsis of spring and fen plant communities in the western Pamir-Alai Mountains is provided. As a result of field investigations and numerical analyses, three fen associations: Caricetum pseudofoetidae, Allietum fedtschenkoani, and Eleocharido quinqueflorae-Primuletum iljinskii have been distinguished. They were included in the Dactylorhizo umbrosae-Caricion orbicularis alliance, which was proposed to comprise the neutral and alkaline alpine fens of Middle Asia. Additionally, within the Montio-Cardaminetea class three spring associations have been defined: Epilobio tianschanici-Bryetum schleicheri, Clementsieturn semenovii and Codonopsideto dematidi-Cortusetum turkestanicae. Because of their floristic composition vague, and some vaguen comparison to European and other Asiatic spring vegetation, the crenic communities of western Pamir-Alai have been assigned provisionally to a Cratoneurion commutati alliance. A synopsis of the spring and fen plant communities of the western Pamir-Alai is also proposed. The main environmental factors determining the species composition of the sampled vegetation are the amount of dissolved electrolytes, altitude and soil reaction.

AB A peatland productivity and decomposition parameter database was compiled to estimate parameters for the Canadian Model for Peatlands (CaMP); a module developed by the Canadian Forest Service to address the need for national-scale greenhouse gas emission estimates from peatlands present in the forested area of Canada. Data were compiled for 186 peatland sites from 69 sources. The SITES table contains wetland classification, tree classification, province or state, country, latitude, longitude, and an indication of coordinate accuracy. The NPP ALL table contains annual net primary productivity (NPP; gm(-2)yr(-1)) data for cases where one estimate for NPP was reported for all aboveground vegetation. The NPP SHRUB, NPP MOSS, and NPP HERB SEDGE tables each contain a classification of species (if available) or vegetation layer and their NPP (gm(-2)yr(-1)). The BIOMASS TREE, BIOMASS SHRUB, BIOMASS HERB SEDGE, and BIOMASS MOSS tables each contain a classification of species (if available) or vegetation layer and their standing aboveground biomass (g/m(2)). Shrubs in the NPP SHRUB and BIOMASS SHRUB tables were further classified into low or tall shrubs, and plants in the NPP HERB and BIOMASS HERB tables into herbs or sedges. The DECAY LITTER table contains decomposition parameters for different litter types and contains a classification of the type of decomposition study, study duration, information on experimental treatments, classification of above- or belowground plant parts, plant species, litter classification, root litter diameter, indication of hardwood or softwood, indication of evergreen or non-evergreen, litter bag depth classification, classes for bag placement relative to the water table and relative to the peat surface, water table depth, decay rate (k exponent), and mass loss values for years 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, and 23 of a decomposition study. The REFERENCES table contains complete citation information and provides links to the source reference pdf file. This data set is vital to the national Canadian peatland modeling effort and should be useful to other peatland scientists and ecosystem modelers. (c) Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, 2018.

AB The spatial and temporal processes of secondary vegetation development on abandoned cutover bog surfaces in the Jura region of northwest Switzerland have been examined. Descriptions of post-abandonment development of peatland based on the vegetation composition of replacement series from previous studies of vegetation ecology have been confirmed by analysis of testate amoebae (Protozoa) in vertical sequences of secondary peat underlying the most advanced vegetation communities in the series. Recovery of bog habitats to conditions similar to those before cutting was rapid. Testate amoebae show this recovery occurred through several different developmental series, all of which led to a common convergence regardless of the initial condition of the old cutover surface. Cutover bogs can be fully restored and testate amoebae are a sensitive new means of monitoring habitat changes in bogs.

AB This study presents the analysis of 381 phytosociological releves describing predominantly ombrotrophic South Patagonian lowland peatland vegetation along a gradient of increasing continentality. Numerical methods such as cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) were carried out to explore the data set. Cluster analysis resulted in nine vegetation types that were also distinctly separated in DCA ordination. The major floristic coenocline along the first DCA axis reflected a gradient of continentality ranging from pacific blanket bogs dominated by cushion plants to Sphagnum-dominated continental raised bogs. Increasing continentality along the first axis was parallel with decreasing peat decomposition and increasing peat depth and acidity. In contrast, floristic variation along the second DCA axis represented a water level gradient.
   The typical sequence of vegetation types along the hollow-hummock moisture gradient that is well established for north hemispherical peatlands could also be observed in Sphagnum-dominated South Patagonian raised bogs with a surprising similarity in floristic and structural features. Concerning the gradient of continentality significant differences in comparison with the northern hemisphere could be established. Most obvious was the dominance of cushion building plants (e.g. Astelia pumila, Donatia fascicularis) in South Patagonian oceanic peatlands, whereas this life form is totally absent from the northern hemisphere. Similar to the continental Sphagnum bogs the cushion plant vegetation of hyperoceanic peatlands exhibited a clear separation along the moisture gradient.

AB Although previous studies hint at the occurrence of substantial spatial variation in the accumulation rates of C and N in bogs, the extent to which rates may vary on high-resolution spatial and temporal scales is not known. A main reason for the lack of knowledge is that it is problematic to determine the precise age of peat at a given depth. We determined rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation in the uppermost decimeters of a bog ecosystem using the pine method, which enables accurate dating of surface pear layers. We combined accumulation data with numerical and geostatistical analyses of the recent vegetation to establish the relationship between bog vegetation and rate of peat accumulation. Use of a laser technique for spatial positioning of 151 age-determined peat cores within a 20 x 20 m plot made it possible for us to give the first fine-scaled account of spatial and temporal variation in rates of mass, carbon, and nitrogen accumulation during the last century.
   Rates of C and N accumulation were highly variable at all spatial scales studied. For example, after similar to 125 yr of peat growth, C and N accumulation varied by factors of five and four, respectively, from 25 to 125 g/dm(2) for C, and from 0.7 to 2.6 g/dm(2) for N. It takes similar to 40 yr of peat accumulation before significant amounts of C are lost through decay. Hummocks built up by Sphagnum fuscum and S. rebellum were able to maintain average rates of C accumulation that exceed 2 g.dm(-2).yr(-1) during 50 yr of growth. We argue that data on spatial variation in rates of C accumulation are necessary to understand the role of boreal peatlands in the greenhouse effect and global climate.

AB An extensive survey of European wetlands was undertaken to compare the importance of growing conditions vs functional characteristics of vegetation in determining N, P and K contents.
   Stress-tolerator dominated stands (S) had consistently lower nutrient contents and higher N : P ratios whereas ruderal-dominated (R) stands displayed the opposite pattern. Competitor (C) and competitor-stress tolerator (CS) stands were intermediate to R and S.
   These patterns were mostly preserved after removing covariation between vegetation and environment, thus indicating constitutional differences in nutrient signatures between functionally differentiated vegetation. C and R stands were least likely to be nutrient limited. Half of the S stands were probably P-limited but C, CS and R stands rarely or never experienced P limitation. Inferred colimitation by K was twice as frequent in S stands compared with other vegetation.
   This study extends the evidence for syndromes of traits closely linked to nutrient use efficiency that increase fitness under particular growing conditions. It also highlights patterns at a community level across a wide range of wetland types and suggests that tissue nutrient signatures will have diagnostic value in predicting community responses to perturbation in nutrient availability.

AB Boreal and subarctic peatlands today represent a large global carbon (C) reservoir. Existing models that describe organic matter accumulation in peatlands over thousands of years are inadequate for predicting short-term responses to changing climate. This paper develops a new, empirically based model that estimates net primary production (NPP) and depth-dependent decay rates (exponential decay k values) of near-surface peat. Application of the model to three sites in boreal Alberta indicates that today the sites are net sinks for atmospheric C at rates of 34-52 g C.m(-2).yr(-1). Even without climate change, within 80-160 years, these sites will attain steady-state conditions with no further net C accumulation. Climate change scenarios in which NPP or k values are allowed to change gradually and linearly (at 0.1% per year) affect net C sequestration. Any scenario of decreasing NPP or increasing k values results in the peatlands switching from net sinks to net sources of atmospheric C within the next 20-62 years. Regional C balance of the peatlands in boreal, continental, western Canada will at best diminish in terms of strength of an atmospheric C sink and may well shift to becoming a source of atmospheric C. Shifts from sinks to sources of atmospheric C may occur within time frames that are similar in magnitude to the anticipated doubling of atmospheric CO2 by the middle of the 21st century.

AB Western Boreal Plain peatlands can play an important role in the global nitrogen cycle by storing N in peat and potentially releasing large amounts of N to the atmosphere. In this study, biological denitrification rates were measured in marsh and fen vegetation zones in two boreal peatland-pond complexes in northcentral Alberta, Canada. Assuming negligible winter denitrification, we estimated annual denitrification rates of 11 g N.m(-2) in marshes and 24 g N.m(-2) in fens. Two techniques were employed to measure denitrification: 1) measurements of direct N-2-flux were taken from intact cores in gas-tight N-free chambers, and 2) nitrous oxide (N2O) flux was measured in the two fens using in situ chambers. N-2 fluxes ranged from 2.14-4.19 mg N.m(-2).h(-1) in marshes and 6.19-6.81 mg N.m(-2).h(-1) in fens. N2O release from fen peat ranged from consumption to 0.025 mg N.m(-2).h(-1). Peat with higher carbon and moisture content was a source of N2O Whereas peat with lower carbon and moisture content was a sink. Surface water did not appear to be a major source of nitrate for denitrification. However, denitrification rates were positively correlated with peat extractable nitrate. Combined with mineralization studies, this indicated that soil nitrification provided most of the substrate for denitrification.

AB Nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) deposition, as well as altered soil moisture dynamics due to climate change can have large effects on fen meadow biogeochemistry and vegetation. Their combined effects may differ strongly from their separate effects, since each process affects different nutrients through different mechanisms. However, the impacts of these environmental problems are rarely studied in combination. We therefore investigated the separate and interactive effects of current levels of N- and S-deposition and changes in soil moisture dynamics on fen meadow vegetation. We focused on vegetation biomass and N:P stoichiometry, including access to soil P through root surface phosphatase activity, in a 3-year factorial addition experiment in an N-limited rich fen meadow in the Biebrza valley in Poland. We applied 29.5 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 32.1 kg S ha(-1) year(-1), which correspond to current deposition levels in Western Europe. Changes in soil moisture dynamics due to climate change were mimicked by amplified drying of the soil in summer. This level of N-deposition had limited effects on plant biomass production in this rich fen, despite low foliar N:P ratios that suggest N limitation. This level of S-deposition, however, resulted in decreased vegetation P-uptake and biomass. We also showed that increased summer drought resulted in considerable increases in vegetation biomass. We found no interactive effects on vegetation biomass or N:P stoichiometry, possibly as a result of the limited main effects of the separate processes.

AB Following a severe fire in 1986 on the estuarine raised mire of Cors Fochno, Wales, a larval transect was initiated across the burnt and unburnt sections to investigate the recovery of the rosy marsh moth Coenophila subrosea population. This paper reports the results of 16 years of surveillance and relates larval density to the growth of the main food plant, bog myrtle Myrica gale. Earlier suggestions that fire is a necessary management tool to maintain Myrica at a young stage of its growth appear unfounded and hydrological effects are probably sufficient to ensure rapid turnover of the foodplant. Eighteen years in which there has been no significant disturbance to the mire vegetation has not led to the predicted decline in the moth population. However, changes in vegetational composition are occurring as a result of conservation management to the hydrological regime of the mire and further studies will be required to investigate whether restoration of the peatland water table leads to a significant reduction in the abundance in food plants or a decline in the status of the rosy marsh moth.

AB Mid-Holocene tephra layers have been located and geochemically analysed from seven ombrotrophic bogs in Scotland. The tephras found in these Scottish peats occur as stratigraphically discrete horizons, not visible to the naked eye, and originate from volcanic activity in Iceland. Identifying and geochemically typing the tephra layers can enable precise correlations between sites on regional scales, depending on the spatial extent of the airfall events. Dispersal of both the Glen Garry and Hekla-4 tephras is excellent over Scotland, enabling snapshot views of the past at the time of these tephra depositions. Palaeoecological analyses have also been undertaken on these bogs, providing detailed reconstructions of past changes in bog vegetation and surface wetness, a proxy for past climates. Correlations between the ombrotrophic bogs at the time of the Glen Garry tephra revealed significant differences between the proxy climate records in the north and the south of Scotland, suggesting asynchronous changes between northern Scotland and the rest of Great Britain.

AB In North America, mulching of vacuum-harvested sites combined with blocking of the drainage system is widely used for peatland restoration to accelerate Sphagnum establishment. However, peat extraction in fen peatlands or exposure of deeper minerotrophic peat layers results in soil chemistry that is less suitable for re-establishment of Sphagnum moss. In this situation, restoration of plant species characteristic of minerotrophic peatlands is desirable to return the site to a carbon accumulating system. In these cases, it may be worthwhile to maintain spontaneously revegetating species as part of restoration if they provide desirable ecosystem functions. We studied the role of six spontaneously recolonizing vegetation communities for methane (CH4) emissions and pore water CH4 concentration for two growing seasons (2008 and 2009) at an abandoned minerotrophic peatland in southeastern Quebec. We then compared the results with bare peat and adjacent natural fen vegetation. Communities dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex aquatilis and Typha latifolia had CH4 flux an order of magnitude greater than other cutover vegetation types and natural sites. In contrast, Scirpus atrocinctus and Equisetum arvense had CH4 emission rates lower than natural hollow vegetation. We found seasonal average water table and vegetation volume had significant correlation with CH4 flux. Water table and soil temperature were significantly correlated with CH4 flux at plots where the water table was near or above the surface. Pore water CH4 concentration suggests that CH4 is being produced at the cutover peatland and that low measured fluxes likely result from substantial oxidation of CH4 in the unsaturated zone. Understanding ecosystem functions of spontaneously recolonizing species on cutover fens can be used to help make decisions about the inclusion of these communities for future restoration measures.

AB Subarctic permafrost peatlands are important soil organic carbon pools, and improved knowledge about peat properties and peatland sensitivity to past climate change is essential when predicting future response to a warmer climate and associated feedback mechanisms. In this study, Holocene peatland development and permafrost dynamics of four subarctic peat plateaus in Finnmark, northern Norway have been investigated through detailed analyses of plant macrofossils and geochemical properties. Peatland inception occurred around 9800 cal. yr BP and 9200 cal. yr BP at the two continental sites Suossjavri and Iskoras. Younger basal peat ages were found at the two coastal locations Lakselv and Karlebotn, at least partly caused by the time lag between deglaciation and emergence of land by isostatic uplift. Here, peatland development started around 6150 cal. yr BP and 5150 cal. yr BP, respectively. All four peatlands developed as wet fens throughout most of the Holocene. Permafrost aggradation, causing frost heave and a shift in the vegetation assemblage from wet fen to dry bog species, probably did not occur until during the last millennium, ca. 950 cal. yr BP in Karlebotn and ca. 800 cal. yr BP in Iskoras, and before ca. 150 cal. yr BP in Lakselv and ca. 100 cal. yr BP in Suossjavri. In Karlebotn, there are indications of a possible earlier permafrost phase around 2200 cal. yr BP due to climatic cooling at the late Subboreal to early Subatlantic transition. The mean long-term Holocene carbon accumulation rate at all four sites was 12.3 +/- 4.1 gC m(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SD) and the mean soil organic carbon storage was 97 +/- 46 kgC m(-2).

AB In the NW part of Slovenia, at the southern border of the Sphagnum-mire area in Europe, the plant species diversity and vegetation structure of mires (sedge fen, spruce mire and dwarf-pine bog) and spruce forests were investigated using ordination techniques (detrended correspondence analysis, DCA). The mires studied occur at around 1200 metres above sea level. The correlation between plant distribution patterns and ecology, with particular reference to soil variables, was examined. Based on DCA ordination, the sedge fens were clearly distinguished from the dwarf-pine bogs and the spruce mires, as well as from the spruce forests on the mineral soils. A significant correlation between the first DCA axis and the plant species diversity was found. The Shannon diversity index and the species richness were highest in the sedge fen and on the mire-forest border zone. The first DCA axis was interpreted as a reflection of the gradients of the soil pH, the amount of calcium and the base saturation level. The first axis clearly differentiated the Sphagnum species (e.g. S. girgensohnii, S. magellanicum, S. russowii, S. flexuosum., S. capillifolium) from the moss species belonging mostly to Amblystegiaceae (e.g. Drepanocladus cossonii, Campylium stellatum, Calliergon cordifolium, Cratoneuron decipiens). The second DCA axis was interpreted in terms of the soil water content, total carbon content, ON ratio and peat depth. It evidently differentiated the spruce forest on the mineral soil from the various mire ecosystems.

AB 1. In the face of a rapidly changing environment, long-term studies provide important insights into patterns of vegetation and processes of change, but long-term studies are rare for many ecosystems.
   2. We studied recent vegetation changes at a fine scale in a Sphagnum-dominated bog in south Sweden by resurveying part of the bog 54 years after the original phytosociological survey. We used an indirect approach to identify changes in vegetation composition in relation to environment because of a lack of permanent sampling units. By applying a weighted averaging technique, we calculated relative changes in species optimum values for different environmental gradients as represented by indicator values for light, temperature, pH, moisture and nutrients.
   3. Species composition of the mire vegetation has changed significantly over the past five decades, as indicated by significant changes in species frequencies and species optima for the gradients examined. Species with lower indicator values for moisture and light and higher indicator values for nutrients have become more frequent on the mire. In particular, species of trees and dwarf shrubs increased in frequency, whereas typical mire species decreased (e. g. Trichophorum cespitosum (L.) Hartm.) or disappeared from the study site (e. g. Scheuchzeria palustris L.).
   4. Synthesis. Composition of the mire vegetation is found to be dynamic at different temporal and spatial scales. Increased air temperature and nutrient availability in south Sweden over the past few decades may have augmented productivity (e. g. tree growth), resulting in drier and shadier conditions for several species. This study successfully demonstrated the applicability of an indirect approach for detecting long-term vegetation change at a fine scale. This approach is an effective way of using historic and modern phytosociological data sets to detect vegetation and environmental change through time.

AB Current models and theories of the formation and maintenance of microtopography in ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs) assume autogenic feedbacks between vegetation composition, water table depth (WTD) and microtopography. A hypothesized outcome of autogenic feedbacks is a strong association among spatial variations in vegetation composition, WTD and microtopography. We tested and corroborated this hypothesis using fine spatial scale (<2x2m(2)) data from two 20 x 20 m(2) plots at Mer Bleue, a temperate bog. Furthermore, we partitioned the spatial variation of plant communities into portions explained by WTD as well as fine-scale and broad-scale spatial structures using distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps. We hypothesized that plant distributions are more strongly related to WTD than to microtopography and found that this hypothesis was supported in only one of the two sampled plots, suggesting that the feedbacks among WTD, vegetation and microtopography could be dependent on location within a bog. A plot closer to the centre (apex) of the bog showed stronger relationships among WTD-microtopography and vegetation than a plot closer to the margin. Our results support current models and theories of the development of bogs wherein plant communities, water table and microtopography are strongly associated because of underlying ecohydrological feedbacks but highlight that strength and direction of feedbacks may vary by location within a bog. Affirming the presence of these structural relationships and identifying variability in them is a key step towards better understanding peatland carbon cycling, especially in the context of increasing anthropogenic and natural disturbances to peatlands.

AB The aim of this paper was to evaluate the link between environmental conditions and the vegetation pattern of mountain peatlands drained for forestry. We assumed that (a) water chemistry and soil properties differ between the investigated peatlands types-from fen to bog, (b) the vegetation pattern is dependent on water chemistry and soil properties, and (c) water chemistry and soil properties play different roles in determining peatland patterning. For our study, five ecologically and topographically diverse forestry-drained shallow peatlands in Central Sudetes, Poland, were selected. A comparison between the studied peatlands and environmental variables was done by discriminant analysis, whereas vegetation-environmental relationship was analysed by canonical correspondence analysis. Results demonstrated that pH, HCO3-, NO3-, and Ca2+ best explained the variation in water chemistry (approximately 74%), whereas base saturation, pH(water), and plant-available phosphorus best explained the variation in soil properties. Plant assemblages within the peatlands exhibited three vegetation clusters that did not always correspond to peatland ecological type. The vegetation was mostly affected by water chemistry (explained up to 54% of variation), rather than by soil properties. Vegetation within such ecosystems seems to be a good indicator of differences in water chemistry, caused by differences in bedrock (soligenic fen peatlands) or atmospheric inputs (ombrogenic bogs). Our results will help improve our understanding of vegetation-environment relationships in degraded mountain peatland ecosystems in the temperate climate zone. They might also be useful for proper planning of restoration and monitoring of these ecosystems.

AB 1. Multivariate analysis of vegetation and water beetles recorded in the abandoned drains and flooded workings of a cut-over lowland Irish raised bog, Montiaghs Moss, shows that water depth and trophic status are key predictors of plant species composition and that vegetation community structure significantly explains water beetle composition.
   2. The spatial distribution of secondary and tertiary drains and peat pits influences species composition indirectly, through trophic status, by connecting habitats with primary agricultural drains passing through the bog.
   3. Habitat isolation and the cessation of drain management promote change in the submerged aquatic vegetation, emergent-swamp and poor-fen habitats recorded by facilitating vegetation development and surface acidification.
   4. The ecological consequences are likely to be a reduction in the area of open-water habitats, the development of poor-fen vegetation and the subsequent loss of high conservation value species of plants and beetles.
   5. Management for biodiversity conservation should initially address water quality, for example, through the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive, followed by restoration to promote structural and spatial heterogeneity of drain and peat-pit habitats.
   6. At a landscape scale, implementing ditch and peat-pit management across abandoned cut-over lowland raised bog habitats in the farmed Northern Ireland countryside, through EU Common Agricultural Policy agri-environment schemes, would give regional gains.

AB Question
   Do tissue element concentrations at the individual species level vary along major vegetation gradients in wetlands, and can they indicate environmental conditions?
   Location
   West Carpathians.
   Methods
   Total plant species composition was recorded in plots distributed along a poor to rich gradient within spring fens and along the gradient from fens to wet meadows. Eriophorum angustifolium (Cyperaceae) and three broadleaf dicotyledonous herb species were collected from the vegetation plots. Tissue N, P, K, Ca and Fe concentrations, N:P and N:K ratios of the species were determined. Each variable was correlated with the sample scores along the first two axes of the DCA ordination, which represented the two main vegetation gradients.
   Results
   K and Ca concentrations in a particular species correlated well with the vegetation gradients, thus indicating changes in the element availability to the species. The trends were sometimes contradictory to known patterns at the community level, but the differences could be ecologically interpreted. Contrary to Ca and K, patterns in N, P and Fe concentration appeared to be more species-specific. E. angustifolium had a lower K and Ca concentration than the broadleaf herbs.
   Conclusions
   Compared to community-level measurements, element concentrations in individual species correlated less with observed vegetation gradients. Trends found at the species level may indicate changes in ecological conditions affecting the species, although they need not correspond with trends found at the community level. We conclude that the species-level approach cannot substitute, but can advance, the community-level approach in searching for mechanisms underlying vegetation gradients within wetlands.

AB Peatlands have undergone dramatic changes through anthropogenic activities in the last centuries, causing a substantial loss of fen-specific biodiversity. Therefore, restoration of already degraded stands is an important conservation issue. The effectiveness of fen restoration was evaluated through rewetting in the valley of the river Peene, NE Germany, by comparing three fen types: drained fens, rewetted fens, and near-natural fens. Rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) were used as indicators, comprising an ecologically important yet understudied insect group. 5,398 individuals from 121 staphylinid species were recorded by 30 pitfall traps per fen type, which were biweekly emptied between April and October 2012, and related to environmental parameters. Rove beetle assemblages differed markedly between fen types. Community structure was affected by peat degradation, the extent of organic matter, water level, and vegetation height. Fen rewetting favoured the establishment of a distinct, species-rich beetle community within 15years only, caused by an increase in hygrophilous wetland species partially replacing generalists. Nevertheless, this time span was not sufficient to restore communities characteristic for near-natural fens, which harboured several particularly sensitive species that were not found on rewetted fens. Rewetting provided suitable habitats for a substantial number of stenotopic and threatened staphylinid beetles. Thus, the protection of pristine habitats along with restoration measures are both important strategies in peatland conservation.

AB Eutrophication of peatlands may have significant effects on emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. This study analyses the effects of nitrogen (28.7 mmol NH4+-N, N), phosphorus (1.78 mmol PO43--P, P) and glucose (2.79 mmol glucose, G) additions on CO2 and CH4 emission from intact soil cores from a Carex-dominated peatland in the Netherlands. The cores (taken from the upper 10cm of the peat profile) were brought to field capacity and aerobically incubated at 20 degrees C for 6 wk. Nutrients were added in the following combinations: 0 (unfertilized control), N, P, NP, G,NG, PG, NPG. All treatments in which glucose was present (G, NG, PG, NPG) stimulated CO2 emission during the first 2 wk of the experiment, but did not lead to increased decay of organic matter. At the end of the experiment, all treatments which included N (N, NG, NP, NPG) showed reduced CO2 emission. This was probably due to pH effects, because the pH in the N fertilized treatments was 0.4-0.8 units lower than in the unfertilized control. Cumulative CO2 emission in the N treatment was lower than in the control, but in the treatments where glucose was added it was higher. There was no effect of P addition on CO2 emission. In all treatments, cumulative CH4 emission was higher than in the control due to an initial stimulation of CH4 emission. Compared within treatments, cumulative CO2-C emission was 35-164 times higher than cumulative CH4-C emission. From these observations we conclude that increased amounts of NH4+-N supply lead to reduction of decay of organic matter in peat soils and thereby to a reduction of gaseous carbon loss from these soils. Nutrient or glucose additions lead only to a short-term increase in methane emissions from peat soils. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Question Filtering vegetation plot records according to sampling size is an essential methodological step in vegetation studies. In fens, the variation of traditionally used plot sizes seems to limit continental-scale syntheses following the Braun-Blanquet approach. Which plot sizes harbour the analogous number of habitat specialists (i.e., diagnostic/indicator species) and capture the main compositional gradients identically?
   Location Scandinavia, central Europe.
   Methods The data set of fen vegetation plot records was compiled using large databases and categorised into four distinct habitats. For each habitat, semi-log species-area curves of specialists and other species were fitted using generalised additive models (GAM). In addition, we surveyed 72 sites in a series of plot sizes (0.07, 0.25, 1, 4, 16 m(2)) where we applied, separately for each plot size, Non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) and compared the resulting patterns with Procrustes analysis.
   Results Consistently across different fen habitats, the species-area curves of specialists increased steeply up to the plot size of 1 m(2), while increasing negligibly in the plot size range of 1-25 m(2). In contrast, the species-area curves of other species displayed mostly linear to linear-exponential trends. NMDS ordinations of medium (1 and 4 m(2)) and large plots (16 m(2)) were the most congruent, while the patterns captured in the ordination of the smallest plots (0.07 m(2)) differed most from the others.
   Conclusions In fens, plot sizes of at least 1 m(2) describe sufficiently the broad-scale pattern in specialists' diversity as well as the main environmental gradients. The range of plot sizes of 1-25 m(2) may be safely merged in broad-scale analyses of fen vegetation without introducing substantial bias, at least when compared with other possible uncertainty sources.

AB Concentrations of N, P, S, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb, Al, and AIA (acid insoluble ash) in mosses (three Sphagnum species and Tomenthypnum nitens, all hummock species) from a variety of mires, both ombrotrophic and minerotrophic, in the coastal western and central parts of Canada are considered in relation to surface water pH and concentrations of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, and SO42-. Distinct west-east concentration gradients were present for most elements in both mosses and water, but there were correlations between surface water and moss concentrations only for Ca and Mg.
   On ombrotrophic sites and sites characterized by poor fen vegetation, wet deposition is the main source of elements in the surface water. On rich fen sites, additional Ca and Mg from surrounding soils change the elemental proportions. We conclude that hydrochemically the limit between poor and rich fen sites is more decisive than between bog and fen. The increase in Ca may give brown mosses a competitive advantage over Sphagnum.
   Moss concentrations of Na and Mg are the only ones decreasing inland. The constancy or inland increase of moss elemental concentrations may depend on either an increasing atmospheric supply (e.g. Pb), differences in moss growth rates (especially N, P, and K) or site conditions related to the water regime (e.g. Fe and Al).

ID NORTH; BOGS; PH
AB Background: Abernethy Forest, an area of native Caledonian Scots pine forest, includes areas of open or sparsely forested peatland, largely ombrotrophic, but locally influenced by water from mineral ground.
   Aims: To relate vegetation species-composition to the limit of ombrotrophy inferred from water chemistry.
   Methods: Species composition was listed in 300 sample quadrats; chemical analyses of water samples were available from 200 of these. The vegetation data were classified using TWINSPAN. Relationships between vegetation and chemical results were analysed statistically using contingency tables.
   Results: Eleven 'vegetation types' were recognised, five (189 samples) judged as primarily ombrotrophic-bog vegetation. The others showed evidence of flushing, or transition to forest. A previous analysis of major cations in the 200 water samples indicated that a limiting Ca/Mg ratio of 1.0 divided 61 samples showing telluric influence from 139 essentially ombrotrophic samples. Neither division was sharp. Contingency tables showed that the division based on vegetation types was strongly associated with the division of the water samples based on cation ratios.
   Conclusions: Large areas of bog south and east of Loch Garten are unequivocally ombrotrophic; the main telluric-influenced sites occupy openings in the forest west of the loch. The limited 'fen' flora probably reflects the small size and isolation of the calcium-rich sites and the dominating influence of the ombrotrophic peats.

AB Peatlands are recognized as important landscape elements and their disturbance, followed by the loss of their ecohydrological functions, leads to falling water tables and degradation. Sometimes, the shortage of hydrological monitoring data impedes the detection of degrading peatland areas. The application of cost-effective remote sensing methods for assessment of humidity conditions permits monitoring of a large area and longer periods of time. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the links between hydrological parameters and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as well as identifying spatio-temporal patterns in the condition of raised bog vegetation, according to NDVI, in the epkeliai raised bog, a semipristine peatland in south-eastern Lithuania. Time series of NDVI (2000-2018) were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and compared with field measurements. A strong positive correlation between NDVI and water table depth was found. Moderate (for the whole raised bog) and strong (for control subbasin) positive correlations between NDVIavg and annual minimum flow over 30 and 7 days were found. This confirms that NDVI could be treated as an appropriate indicator, showing the degradation processes of the raised bog ecosystem and could be applied in its management. Analysis of the interannual NDVIavg variation confirmed the prevalence of stable favourable conditions during the growing season with a slight decrease in NDVImax over last 4 years. Meanwhile, analysis of spatial NDVI variation revealed obvious spatial patterns where possible degradation processes tend to appear.

AB Sulphur forms were determined at two peatland sites in Scotland, each having both open bog vegetation and afforested areas. Afforestation activity (including initial ploughing and, in one case, active drainage) had a significant effect on peat physical characteristics, depending on the depth sampled, but had less influence on S chemistry. There was no significant difference in mean total S concentration (mean of 0.24% over the upper 100 cm peat) between the two sites or between the afforested and open areas. Organic S was dominant with approximately 64% of the total S being C-bonded S and 27% ester sulphate S. Reduced inorganic forms (acid volatile S, elemental S and Cr-reducible S) accounted for approximately 8% of the total S. On average, only half of the Cr-reducible S could be accounted for by pyrite S as determined by analysis of the Fe; the remainder was considered to be an organic S fraction. The presence of both S-oxidizing thiobacilli and sulphate-reducing bacteria were indicative of an active oxidation/reduction cycle that resulted in the accumulation of S at or below the mean water table. The results are discussed in terms of S retention and alkalinity generation in peatlands.

AB Prescribed burning of moorland, heathland and blanket bog vegetation on peatlands in the UK is a contentious issue. Given the large carbon store in these peatlands, concern ha:; been raised over land management and its effect on the carbon dynamics of peat ecosystems. In particular the spatial and temporal link between burning and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in waters draining these catchments has received particular attention. This study investigates water colour and DOC concentrations in soil pore water and runoff water at the plot-scale over a chronosequence of burn ages. Results from this study show that there is an elevated water colour in the few years immediately following burning but that this is not matched by a rise in DOC concentration. Therefore we propose that burning appears to affect the composition of the DOC rather than the absolute DOC concentration. This study also highlights that in some cases the use of water colour as a proxy for DOC concentration should be treated with caution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The bog vegetation is sensitive to climate change correlating with the global scale cooler period of the later 19th and early 20th centuries.

AB Methane fluxes were studied at two high-elevation oligotrophic peat bogs in the Ore Mts., Czech Republic. The Bukova dolina Bog was drained 15 years ago and 2 years ago was partly restored, whereas the Brumiste Bog is an intact peatland. Draining led to a change of vegetation structure, dominated by Molinia caerulea, Carex sp., and forestation by Norway spruce. Methane fluxes were measured monthly from April to November 2011 using a closed chamber. Temperature and presence of Carex were significant controls on methane fluxes. Peat depth, water table and the presence of other plant species had no significant effect on CH4 emissions. Methane emissions ranged from 9 to 2700 mg/m(2)/day at the degraded and from 3 to 260 mg/m(2)/day at the intact bog. In general, the degraded peat bog emitted three times more methane compared to the intact peat bog, likely due to vegetation changes after long-term artificial draining.
